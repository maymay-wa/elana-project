political disorders ethnic tensions 
poverty and international disputes are churning up the south seas 
in an arc curving sharply northward from new zealand and back down 
to australia 
vanuatu new caledonia fiji tahiti papua new guinea tonga 
western samoa even new zealand and australia themselves have had 
a taste of trouble in the past year 
most recently it was rioting in vanuatu over land claims and in 
the french territory of new caledonia 19 native kanaks were killed 
in a shootout with french troops in ethnic and political disorders 
fiji has seen two coups in the past year and the former british 
island remains unstable in the aftermath 
australia is concerned about what it sees as the speading 
influence of libyas col moammar gadhafi in the area and the 
inroads made by the soviet union in what long has been seen as an 
american lake 
a commentator in the sydney morning herald newspaper said the 
image of a south seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished 
the past year also has seen riots in tahiti and political 
upheaval in papua new guinea over the alleged corruption of cabinet 
ministers 
new zealand faces racial unrest as indigenous maoris press the 
labor party government of prime minister david lange with a battery 
of land and fisheries claims 
in australia aborigines are using this years bicentennial 
celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of european 
settlement 200 years ago 
in early may bloody violence erupted over territorial and 
french presidential elections in new caledonia culminating in the 
rescue of french hostages held in caves by melanesian separatists 
21 people were killed 
on may 16 a drunken mob ran riot through vanuatus capital 
port vila looting shops and smashing office windows one man died 
nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the 
rioting over land claims 
australia and new zealand responded to the crisis by airlifting 
riotcontrol gear to vanuatu at prime minister walter linis 
request 
prime minister bob hawke of australia linked libya to the 
rioting and said australia could not stand by as a friendly 
countrys government is undermined by what he called a 
nondemocratic process 
there is no doubt about a libyan connection in vanuatu 
hawke said in a city with a population of less than 20000 it is 
clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale 
vanuatu formerly the britishfrench new hebrides shocked the 
generally prowestern south pacific with its decision in 1986 to 
establish diplomatic relations with libya and the soviet union 
since then the soviet union has sought fishing agreements with 
papua new guinea and impoverished kiribati creating concern in 
australia as well as washington about soviet inroads in the region 
more recently the soviet union has approached australia for 
fishing access to australian ports for refueling purposes and to 
australian airports for fishing crews in transit hawke said he 
would treat the request with caution 
elsewhere in the south pacific such nations as tonga and 
western samoa face poverty overcrowding and unemployment many of 
the islanders have migrated to australia and new zealand in search 
of jobs 
all these are turning the once tranquil south pacific into an 
increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots the 
sydney morning herald said 
the sydney daily telegraph echoed that concern calling the 
situation a powderkeg 
the multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising 
discontent the telegraph said moscow has been making big 
efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through 
fishery deals and aid 
racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of 
many pacific islands where populations are mainly melanesian fiji 
and new caledonia are examples 
australia is the major power in the region and its largest aid 
donor 
foreign minister bill hayden has expressed concern about libyan 
activities going as far as to close down libyas diplomatic 
mission in canberra last year after an incident involving the 
aboriginal activist michael mansell 
mansell had returned from libya saying gadhafi was prepared to 
bankroll a black revolution in australia 
the scattered violence in the south seas has no single 
connective thread although in new caledonia and french polynesia 
the crises erupted after france refused to follow the regional 
pattern of decolonization and independence 
france already suffers a major image problem in the south seas 
with the bombing of the greenpeace vessel rainbow warrior in new 
zealand in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on 
the mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state 
in the region 
the island states supported by australia and new zealand have 
declared the south pacific a nuclearfree zone 
in a major turnaround the united states in 1986 designated the 
south pacific an area of concern because of a buildup of the soviet 
pacific fleet 
us officials believe the soviet fleet consists of 755 ships 
and patrol craft including 141 submarines

a program targeted at lowincome women in 
minnesota is helping welfare recipients create their own jobs and 
build successful businesses and promoters hope its success will 
spread to the rest of the country 
a lot of people told me this was going to fail miserably 
said kathryn s keeley president of the 5yearold womens 
economic development corp which was graduating its first class of 
18 fledgling entrepreneurs today 
under the plan welfare recipients receive training and then 
continue receiving public assistance while receiving subsidized 
loans to help them start businesses ranging from cleaning companies 
to hairstyling salons 
the first hurdle we had to cross in this area was skepticism 
can poor women do it said robert friedman president of the 
corporation for enterprise development 
the organization began its first class for welfare entrepreneurs 
in march under the federal self employment investment 
demonstration keeley said she hopes 90 people will graduate by the 
end of the year 
minnesota is the first of five states to launch the program 
which is coordinated by the private nonprofit corporation for 
enterprise development in washington friedman said the other 
states are iowa michigan mississippi and new jersey 
the corporation persuaded federal officials to waive regulations 
which reduce or eliminate benefits when recipients get jobs 
friedman said participants continue receiving assistance even 
after they start their own businesses so they can reinvest profits 
at the womens economic development corp recipients devise a 
business plan learn about marketing financial management and 
other skills and are encouraged to start thinking like 
entrepreneurs 
they can borrow up to 5000 to be loaned in small increments 
as their businesses progress at 1 percent above the prime lending 
rate said joyce yamamoto who directs the organizations pilot 
project known as the self employment training opportunities program 
once a month for at least a year recipients are required to 
work with the organizations accountant to do bookkeeping 
the whole point of that is to get them off on the right 
foot ms yamamoto said 
womens economic development corp received nearly all its 
current annual budget of 600000 from foundations and other 
private sources ms keeley said 
organizers hope to help other states begin similar projects she 
said 
an aspiring filmmaker one of the few men to complete the 
program said welfare recipients face challenges other 
entrepreneurs dont 
most of us who have been down and out have had our selfesteem 
shattered they realized it was important to build that up he 
said of the program asking not to be identified for fear it might 
hurt his business 
promoters point out that the program isnt a cureall for 
welfare problems 
people get poor for different reasons they are going to 
escape in different ways friedman reasoned 
only 10 percent to 15 percent of minnesotas 57000 afdc 
recipients are likely candidates for the program said stephen r 
rhodes planning director for the state office of jobs policy 
nationally the percentage is 2 percent to 5 percent he said 
a forerunner to the current program was launched three years 
ago in that time 22 women started businesses and three have 
already repaid their loans ms keeley said 
they dont hand the business to you you have to work for 
it said ellie richardson who has cleaned homes and businesses 
most of her life and started a janitorial service in late 1986 
they give you the right contacts if you dont follow through 
its your fault 
ms richardson who had been on and off assistance for 30 years 
is selfsupporting now and employs about 10 people im glad im 
off welfare makes you feel depressed and down she said 
before the pilot program ends in 1992 friedman hopes to 
persuade federal officials to waive permanently regulations that 
bar welfare recipients who turn a business profit from keeping 
their benefits while they get their companies off the ground 
we need the federal government to let go a little to let it 
succeed friedman said i must say the department of health and 
human services has been very cooperative but right now the waiver 
process is onerous

when lt gov l douglas wilder was growing 
up in this former confederate capital he waited on tables at 
political dinners in the citys segregated clubs and hotels 
next year wilder could land a job in virginias executive 
mansion as the host of such dinners and the nations first 
elected black governor 
the 57yearold wilder whose grandparents were slaves already 
is the highestranking black elected state official in the country 
although he has not yet announced his candidacy he would be the 
favorite to win the democratic nomination for governor next summer 
mark rozell a political scientist at mary washington college in 
fredericksburg said wilder has no strong opposition within the 
party and among potential republican opponents next november only 
sen paul s trible jr seems at this point to pose a major threat 
to wilders election 
trible is not seeking reelection to the senate this year and 
has not said whether he will run for governor in 1989 
wilder the youngest of eight children grew up in richmond he 
studied chemistry at virginia union university then enlisted in 
the army and won a bronze star for bravery in korea 
he went to law school at howard university and opened a law 
practice here in 1959 ten years later he ran for a virginia 
senate vacancy when other local black leaders showed no interest 
he became the first black to sit in the chamber since 
reconstruction 
in the senate wilder was recognized as a skilled debater who 
quickly learned the rules of parliamentary procedure although his 
early image was that of a firebrand he was never considered a 
militant 
wilder was instrumental in the states adoption of a holiday 
honoring slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr he also 
lobbied unsuccessfully to change lyrics that blacks found offensive 
in the state song carry me back to old virginia 
wilder combined the role of maverick with that of an insider in 
1982 he singlehandedly scuttled the us senate ambition of 
fellow democrat owen b pickett because pickett dared to invoke the 
name of virginias conservative leader harry f byrd jr a us 
senator who left the democratic party in 1970 to become an 
independent the byrd organization had dominated the state for 50 
years 
two years later in july 1984 wilder announced for the 
democratic nomination for lieutenant governor no serious 
opposition arose within the party during the next year and he was 
nominated in june 1985 when virginia democrats also nominated a 
woman for attorney general there were predictions that the party 
was headed for disaster 
but wilder played down his race and offered the image of a 
moderate native son in the tradition of thendemocratic gov 
charles s robb 
a combination of robbs popularity mistakes by wilders gop 
opponent and a tour of the state by wilder helped turn the 
predicted disaster into the second straight democratic sweep of the 
states top three offices 
wilders performance in the administration of gov gerald l 
baliles who cannot by law succeed himself has been mostly lowkey 
however wilder engaged in a wellpublicized feud with robb 
during his first year in office over how much credit robb deserved 
for the 1985 victory wilder also has criticized the 
administrations tax increases for road construction and made a 
show this year of pushing over baliles objections for a repeal 
of the sales tax on overthecounter drugs 
the lieutenant governors major prospective competitor for the 
gubernatorial nomination stepped aside in march when attorney 
general mary sue terry announced that she would seek another term 
in office 
baliles acknowledged this month in a college commencement 
address that wilder could make history next year by becoming the 
first black to lead the states democratic ticket 
baliles office said no endorsement was intended but observers 
said the comment amounted to a warning to potential rivals to stay 
out of wilders way 
wilder is expected to announce his political plans this summer 
according to rozell wilders race may not prevent him from 
becoming governor of the old dominion because of changes over the 
past 20 years in the states population and its attitudes about 20 
percent of virginians are black and the state also has a large 
progressiveminded population in the northern corridor adjoining 
the nations capital 
no black has ever been elected governor in this country in 1986 
los angeles democratic mayor thomas bradley and william lucas a 
republican county executive in michigan both were nominated by 
their parties but lost the election bradley also had failed in his 
first race for governor in 1982 
the only black to serve as a us governor was pinckney bs 
pinchback the lieutenant governor of louisiana who became acting 
governor for six weeks in 18721873 after the governor was 
impeached

lack of an alternative to military 
rule and a protest movement so wellmannered it apparently is no 
threat have stymied us attempts to force gen manuel antonio 
noriega from power 
for his part the general uses the populist appeal that has 
characterized 20 years of de facto military rule and deflects the 
spotlight from himself noriega says the issue is not whether he 
stays or goes but panamas dignity and selfdetermination 
this plays well in a country that knows it was created in 1903 
essentially for washingtons convenience and where a new 
nationalism sparked by the panama canal treaties burns brightly 
in midmay noriega consolidated support in the military by 
forming a military strategy council of 20 loyal officers the 
council most of whose members are from the middle ranks appears 
to be at least on par with the senior officers who serve as chiefs 
of staff 
allegations of drugrunning and of involvement in the 
decapitation murder of opposition figure hugo spadafora which 
spurred the movement to oust noriega a year ago have all but 
evaporated as issues among panamanians 
washington engineered the departures of dictators during the 
past decade in nicaragua haiti the philippines and iran by 
convincing them that their positions were untenable and they could 
not expect us help against popular uprisings 
noriega clearly does not feel threatened by his opposition 
which comes from the genteel educated middle and upper classes 
rather than oppressed masses 
it is an uprising with good manners a rare phenomenon in 
central america while dissidents in other countries form guerrilla 
armies panamanians bang pots and pans wave white handkerchiefs 
and hold brief general strikes 
if you want to see panamanians dead in the streets of panama 
you will not see it deposed president eric arturo delvalle said 
in a recent meeting with reporters panamanians have risked as 
far as they are willing to risk 
noriega has shut down opposition news media his soldiers who 
can crack heads with the best of them when the occasion arises 
have blocked most street demonstrations with intimidation or force 
panamanian life is permeated by a them or us attitude that 
pits workers against the wealthy opposition a small and struggling 
panama against the colossus of the north and panamanian 
independence against us meddling 
noriega popularized the term rabiblancos which translates 
roughly to white butts a reference to the lighter skin common 
to panamas upper classes 
in a recent speech the general said the establishment as he 
has taken to calling the united states will be responsible if 
anything untoward happens to him 
american economic sanctions have lowered the comparatively high 
living standard of many panamanians but made no visible dent in 
noriegas control he has rejected the legitimacy of federal 
indictments in florida charging him with drug trafficking and money 
laundering 
panama and the united states appeared to be negotiating on 
different levels the panamanians wanting to talk about economic 
issues and american troop withdrawals and washington is willing to 
discuss only dropping the indictments in exchange for noriegas 
departure 
noriega says he will not respond to ultimatums and will not deal 
until sanctions are lifted and the additional american soldiers 
troops sent to panama in april are pulled out 
the troops and sanctions remain in place noriega says that 
early in the talks us negotiators gave him 48 hours to be out of 
his country 
although secretary of state george p shultz said last week the 
talks had broken off the united states is trying again this time 
enlisting latin american democracies panamanian opponents of 
noriega had been urging that approach for weeks 
military rule in panama began when col omar torrijos seized 
power in a 1968 coup he banned partisan political activity for the 
next 10 years and some party leaders went into exile or became 
inactive 
the country has had eight civilian presidents and one civilian 
junta since 1968 but power always has resided in the national 
guard recently renamed the panama defense forces noriega commands 
the 15000member force which includes the military and police 
only nicolas ardito barletta in 1984 was elected by popular 
vote and noriega forced him out in 1985 ardito barletta had run 
as a member of the militarydominated revolutionary democratic 
party in an election many contend was fraudulent 
civilian parties have not produced an alternative to military 
rule around whom people will rally and panama is not noted for 
presidential stability presidents sometimes hold office only a few 
weeks 
roberto chiari was president five times in 19601964 and earlier 
served four days as second vice president 
the military and its revolutionary democratic party have proved 
more durable

itzik an israeli version of archie bunker 
cant get used to having arabs nextdoor his arab neighbor cant 
get used to itzik 
the hotheaded pair are the central characters in neighbors 
a comedy series produced by israeli television about a subject most 
people consider deadly serious jewisharab relations 
the 70minute pilot broadcast friday night started off with 
itzik a jewish insurance salesman moving into a new apartment 
hes happy until he notices the nameplate across the hall has a 
distinctly arab ring medawar 
a few minutes later a middleaged woman knocks on itziks door 
to ask for help fixing a short circuit itzik asks her how she 
feels about the issue 
oh i dont mind having jewish neighbors replies muna 
medawar 
but itzik minds have arabs nextdoor 
when mrs medawars husband bassam a garage owner shows up in 
itziks apartment with a tire itzik exclaims oh my god a 
burning tire in the house 
the arab dubs itzik mr transfer 
the references are clear 
burning tires have become a symbol of the sixmonth palestinian 
uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip and rightwing israelis want to transfer all arabs out of 
the occupied lands 
itziks wife dorit is more tolerant within minutes she is 
visiting muna for coffee and setting off a chain of neighborly 
interactions 
the message is simple we can live together said victor 
kamar the arab israeli who directed the show producer mika ravid 
is jewish and the actors are jews and arabs 
it was not so simple to produce a show on personal relations 
between jewish and arab israeli citizens neighbors is israel 
televisions first entertainment show in 20 years to approach such 
sensitive subjects as racism prejudice mutual suspicion and 
political enmity 
at least one previous attempt on educational television failed 
because critics feared the programs encouragement of peaceful 
coexistence might be interpreted as extending beyond friendly 
relations to romantic ties and interfaith marriages 
we may just tiptoe around that bombshell ravid said 
neighbors produced on a budget of a little more than 
50000 is considered the brainchild of yosef barel manager of 
the televisions arabic department nearly two years ago he 
suggested a humorous show about the problem 
we invested a tremendous amount of time and work ravid 
said we sat down over every scene and every sensitive point so 
that it could touch on current issues but not offend anyone on 
either side 
one technique that makes the show understandable to all is that 
the israeli characters speak hebrew with arabic subtitles while 
the arabs speak their own language with hebrew subtitles 
the show is not directly about relations between israelis and 
palestinians from the occupied territories its message of 
tolerance is built around israels arab citizens a community of 
750000 people who have lived in the state since its independence 
but who face discrimination despite their status as citizens 
bassam zumot a palestinian from israeliannexed east jerusalem 
said he thought long and hard before accepting the lead role 
because the theme did not touch on the issue of occupation 
but the burly man who portrays a character constantly battling 
his waistline as well as his wifes diet food is a key factor in 
making the program work his range of facial expressions is one 
reason viewers can laugh at the painful topic that few israelis and 
even fewer palestinians feel free to joke about 
when muna warns him that the rich fried foods he loves will 
drive up his blood pressure he says that guy across the hall 
will give me high blood pressure 
he just needs time to get used to us muna says 
get used to us what are we asthma bassam retorts 
sneaking a plateful of cookies to eat in the bathroom 
the actor hopes the series which will be ready for next 
winters television season will be a step on the road to peace 
i want people to think more than laugh zumot said i 
think of the apartment building as this region of the world the 
jewish apartment is israel and the arab apartment is palestine 
and i want the israelis to learn that when there will be a 
palestinian state it will not be as dangerous as they think

boris n yeltsin the ousted capital communist 
party chief took the unprecedented step of using western news 
media to insist that the partys no 2 man yegor k ligachev 
resign because he is blocking reform 
never before has a fallen soviet leader so sharply and publicly 
criticized a highlevel party official still in power 
in interviews monday with cbs news and the british broadcasting 
corp yeltsin said it was a mistake to say mikhail s gorbachevs 
efforts to remake soviet society are going according to plan 
this is a dangerous thing to say said yeltsin an outspoken 
advocate of reform 
he told the bbc that ligachev should resign because he is the 
main impediment to perestroika the russian word for 
gorbachevs restructuring 
yeltsin also said he was upset that gorbachev did not rally to 
his defense when he was shunted aside 
the interviews shed light on yeltsins fall from power that 
culminated in his removal feb 18 as a candidate or nonvoting 
member of the ruling politburo they also were the most extensive 
he has granted the western media since he was ousted as moscow 
party leader in november 1987 
in addition yeltsin chose to speak out as gorbachev seeks to 
boost his standing at home through his fiveday summit with 
president reagan 
yeltsin told the bbc that ligachev should go because processes 
in the party are too slow because the party is still lagging 
behind because the process of democratization in the party is not 
developing and comrade ligachev is the main person responsible 
for this 
ligachev 67 formally oversees communist party ideology in an 
interview published in paris last year he said he presides over 
the meetings of the central committee secretariat which runs this 
vast country from daytoday 
yeltsin 57 told cbs the style of ligachevs leadership 
contradicts the spirit of perestroika 
hes one of the opponents when it comes to questions of social 
justice yeltsin told the bbc pressed by the interviewer he 
said he thought ligachev should resign 
yeltsin said gorbachevs reforms have met stiff resistance 
in the first period of perestroika there was an excessive 
euphoria about how quickly change would come he said but 
three years have passed and there have been no basic changes if 
there havent been any changes in another three years then 
peoples faith in perestroika will decline 
the stunning statements came as the communist party is embroiled 
in fierce struggles between conservatives and reform advocates in 
preparation for a party conference that opens june 28 the first 
such session since 1941 
it was not known whether yeltsins comments were sanctioned or 
even supported by other highranking party members 
cbs anchorman dan rather who interviewed yeltsin told the 
associated press i cant believe he would do this unless he 
feels right or wrong he has a green light from above 
however rather quoted yeltsin as saying in portions of the 
interview not broadcast by cbs that he received no prior approval 
for his comments 
as moscow party boss yeltsin stood out for his brusque 
attacking manner and populist style 
he was popular among muscovites for criticizing consumer 
shortages sometimes striding into stores to take his complaints 
straight to shopkeepers 
this style apparently got him into trouble when he made a 
stillunpublished speech to the central committee on oct 21 1987 
reports said he criticized what he saw as the slow pace of reform 
and attacked ligachev 
yeltsin confirmed to the bbc that he criticized ligachev by name 
at that meeting 
yeltsin was replaced as moscow party chief by lev n zaikov 
following a meeting during which gorbachev said yeltsin put 
personal ambitions above the interests of the party and also 
lacked selfdiscipline 
removed from the politburo he was named to the cabinetlevel 
position of deputy head of the state construction committee he was 
removed from the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys 
nominal legislature on may 4 
asked if he was upset gorbachev did not defend him yeltsin told 
the bbc im upset he feels this and i told him im 
dissatisfied with my present job 
he said that when relieved of his moscow post i was accused 
of being an ultraleftist which im not im simply in favor of 
energetic action for perestroika which would bring results and 
so far the results are very very insignificant

most americans favor major changes in the 
selection of presidential nominees with six in 10 saying they 
would eliminate political conventions and let voters choose the 
candidates directly a media generalassociated press poll has 
found 
as the primary season winds down with the final contests june 
7 the survey found broad dissatisfaction with the selection 
system a majority of respondents said they did not follow the 
campaigns regularly and only half believed the races provide a good 
discussion of the issues 
sizable minorities said the best candidates generally lose their 
bid for the nomination particularly on the democratic side 
fiftytwo percent of the 1204 adults in the national poll 
favored major changes in the way the parties pick nominees while 
only 38 percent said the system works well enough now ten percent 
didnt know 
the dissatisfaction evenly spanned ideologies and political 
affiliations the most striking split was in age the youngest 
adults ages 1829 thought by a narrow margin that the system 
works well enough while the oldest those older than 64 broadly 
favored major changes by 5628 percent 
the age split was mirrored in levels of attentiveness to the 
races just 27 percent of the youngest group said they had been 
following the primary campaigns regularly compared with 54 percent 
of the oldest group 
there was majority agreement on another way to select 
candidates fiftynine percent said they would prefer to have 
voters select the nominees without any delegates to party 
conventions 
only 31 percent favored the party convention system though 
rules vary by state generally voters select some delegates the 
party selects others and the delegates meet to choose the nominee 
at conventions where under some circumstances delegates can switch 
their allegiance 
just 3 percent liked the idea of letting party leaders select 
the nominee on their own 
in another measure of unhappiness with the presidential 
nomination process sizable minorities of americans said the 
parties generally do not nominate their best candidate from among 
those running 
the democrats fared worse to the point that a plurality of the 
men in the poll said the democrats do not choose their best 
candidate 
overall 46 percent of respondents said the democrats generally 
do pick their best candidate from those who seek the nomination 
and 40 percent said not but while women by a 5133 margin said the 
democrats do take their best candidate men by a 4741 split said 
not 
more respondents overall 52 percent said the republicans 
nominate their best candidate from among those running while 36 
percent said not 
respondents who identified themselves as republicans or 
democrats tended to favor their partys choices but the democratic 
respondents said by 5138 that the republicans make their best 
choice while the republicans and the independents were split on 
whether the democrats make their best pick 
on the selection of vice presidential candidates less than a 
quarter of the respondents said the secondplace finisher should be 
the nominee while a large majority favored leaving the choice to 
the presidential candidate 
fiftyone percent said the nomination campaigns usually provide 
a good discussion of the issues but 40 percent disagreed and 
college graduates and higherincome americans were split on the 
question 
sixtyfour percent of black respondents said the campaigns 
provide a good discussion of the issues possibly a reflection of 
jesse jacksons efforts as a candidate for the democratic 
nomination 
despite criticisms of the super tuesday southern regional 
primaries as largely a superficial media event 55 percent of 
southerners agreed that the campaigns provided a good discussion of 
the issues 
a plurality of respondents overall and a majority of southerners 
said super tuesday was a good idea and 54 percent of all 
respondents said regional primaries should be held again 
on attentiveness to the races 41 percent said they have been 
following this years primaries regularly 50 percent said they 
paid occasional attention and 9 percent followed the campaigns

mikhail s gorbachev was 19 when he 
saw this city and it was in ruins it was then called stalingrad 
and it had been the scene of one of the bloodiest and most savage 
battles of the second world war 
it left an impression that was still vivid in gorbachevs mind 
more than three and a half decades later 
i went to study at moscow state university and i traveled 
through stalingrad which had been destroyed through voronezh 
which had been destroyed he told an interviewer in 1986 
nothing but ruins everywhere the whole country was in ruins 
world war ii divided gorbachevs family and devastated much of 
his home region in southern russia by the time he saw stalingrad 
in 1950 war for the budding law student was no vague or distant 
concept but a terrible reality that had hit close to home 
today more than four decades after the red army struggled and 
defeated the invading nazi armies the war continues to haunt the 
collective soviet soul and perhaps gorbachev himself 
for soviets the conflict they call the great patriotic war 
is simultaneously a glorious chapter in their countrys history 
proof of the superiority of socialism a convenient alibi when 
things go wrong and a tragedy whose scars are felt even today 
the wartime alliance between the united states and soviet union 
against the axis is also cited by gorbachev chief of the communist 
party as proof that the superpowers need not be adversaries but 
can be allies 
when the time posed the question acutely irrevocably and that 
question had to be answered the soviet and american peoples 
united he told a group of american schoolchildren who visited 
the kremlin earlier this month the present time also makes 
vast demands above all on our two great peoples 
virtually every soviet family including gorbachevs was 
touched by the four years of bitter fighting that ranged throughout 
the western soviet union and claimed the lives of 20 million soviet 
soldiers and civilians 
after the german armies drove across the soviet border in june 
1941 gorbachevs father sergei a tractor driver was called to 
the front and served for four years mikhail was 10 years old when 
the fighting broke out 
his native stavropol region 300 miles southwest of volgograd 
was overrun by the german 40th panzer corps for seven months 
beginning in august 1942 just as the battle for stalingrad was 
raging 
from just one collective farm in the stavropol region in the 
village of beshpagir 417 young men and women went away to fight 
and were killed in battle 
the grip of world war ii on the soviet mind and the use made of 
the memories by authorities are nowhere more evident than in the 
city once called stalingrad in the titanic battle that raged here 
as many as 1 million soviets may have perished and 15 million 
germans were killed wounded or taken prisoner 
in this city situated on a bend in the volga river 600 miles 
south of moscow 90 percent of the buildings in the industrial and 
residential center were devastated by artillery strikes dive 
bombing raids and months of dogged housetohouse fighting 
president franklin d roosevelt said the eightmonth battle that 
ended in february 1943 with the surrender of encircled nazi units 
had marked the turning point in the war of the allied nations 
against the forces of aggression 
at former soviet battlefield sites like volgograd every day is 
memorial day about 3 million soviets visit a gigantic memorial 
complex here each year many of them veterans returning to see the 
place where many of their comrades were killed 
you feel a great weight in your soul said amazas s 
arutunyan 63 an armenian who served as a private in the 93rd 
artillery regiment until he was badly wounded so many men fell 
in combat some screaming others just falling in silence like 
leaves 
the war medals worn by the wizened man thumped against his chest 
as he slowly climbed a halfmile to the top of mamayev kurgan hill 
where a huge statue of mother russia slightly larger than the 
statue of liberty brandishes a sword and calls on her children to 
smite the invader 
in a cavernous hall dominated by an enormous white stone hand 
holding a blazing torch 34 dipped red banners record the names of 
more than 7000 soviet men and women who died defending stalingrad 
a recording of solemn music plays over and over 
the effect is overpowering 
you cannot come here without tears said nadezhda denisova 
61 a volgograder who was 19 when the battle of stalingrad began 
her eyes welled there were so many dead 
a visitors book is filled with poignant messages left by those 
who have come to the monument one man wrote uncle vasiya i 
have found you at last your name is on one of the banners 
the memorial complex on mamayev kurgan hill does not only stress 
the heroism and patriotism of the soviets who fought here but also 
the fact that they fought in the name of socialism and soviet power 
the name of josef v stalin wartime generalissimo and soviet 
dictator was stripped from this city in 1961 when it was renamed 
volgograd but now the party as a whole is lauded as the organizer 
of world war ii victory 
olga sobelyova made that point as she slowly escorted a group of 
24 orphans from the central russian city of sasovo up the hill 
toward the giant statue of mother russia 
children you mustnt think that it was just our armies who 
won here said the 41yearold guide from volgograd it was our 
entire country our socialist system and our communist party

with organ donations declining and more americans 
than ever awaiting transplants specialists are begging doctors to 
make better use of consent laws designed to persuade families to 
consider donations 
there is a large faction of the profession that has never 
wanted to have anything to do with this transplant business 
said dr lawrence g hunsicker president of the american society 
of transplant physicians whose annual meeting begins today 
over and over again we hear from a donors family that they 
are glad they gave and others say they wish they had had the 
chance he said and yet the profession is not responding 
federal law requires hospitals to have a protocol for 
approaching the families of braindead patients about the 
possibility of organ donation fortyfour states also have versions 
of the statute 
the overall results are not impressive 
fewer kidney and heartlung transplants were performed 
nationwide in 1987 than in 1986 according to the us department 
of health and human services and although there were a record 
number of heart liver and pancreas transplants in 1987 the 
increase did not keep pace with previous years 
figures for 1988 are not yet available but organ donations 
appear to be down by up to 10 percent said dr john mcdonald 
president of the american society of transplant surgeons and the 
united network for organ sharing 
the problem is that they hospitals often have the wrong 
people asking in order to comply with the law said roger evans 
senior research scientist at the battelle seattle research center 
doctors are big offenders experts say 
theyve got to be the hardest group in the world to educate 
once theyre out of medical school its like theyre on remote 
control said faye davis executive director of the new york 
regional transplant program 
you cannot make a doctor do something he doesnt want to do 
and there are lots of reasons why he doesnt think its 
appropriate to ask mrs jones for her husbands organs hunsicker 
said they think it takes a lot of time that it will be a 
nuisance and they dont get anything out of it 
some physicians tell patients next of kin i know you dont 
want to do this but the law says i have to ask you if you want to 
be a donor ms davis said 
others approach distraught families too quickly about 20 
percent of the california transplant donor networks calls about 
potential donors for instance come from emergency rooms 
thats awfully early to make a decision about a person being 
braindead a condition in which the brain no longer functions 
but the body is sustained by machine said phyllis weber executive 
director of the san franciscobased network 
part of the problem in general is that dying and death are 
taboo subjects among healthcare professionals said john 
kiernan administrator of the organ recovery program for the 
presbyterian hospital in new york city 
it seems to me we might do a better job of requesting 
donations if these requests are made within the context of an 
effective bereavement program he said 
in addition to poorly implemented consent laws experts say the 
supply of healthy organs has been reduced as recent safety measures 
including seat belt and motorcycle helmet laws have cut down on 
the number of premature deaths the pool of potential organ donors 
also has been reduced in places by the growing number of people 
testing positive for the aids virus 
only about 4000 of the estimated 22000 to 25000 potential 
organ donors actually become donors each year evans said 
a record 14720 people meanwhile are awaiting transplants in 
the united states said william vaughn technical services director 
for the united network for organ sharing 
it may well be that we will never meet the need kiernan 
said no matter what we do

president and mrs reagan agonized over whether to 
visit a jewish refusenik family after a top soviet foreign ministry 
official warned that it would ruin the familys chances to 
emigrate us sources say 
in the end the visit never came off and a 12yearold girl who 
calls herself a lifelong refusenik was disappointed 
us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said monday that 
deputy foreign minister alexandr bessmertnykh warned us 
ambassador jack f matlock during a summit planning meeting last 
week that the zieman family would never be permitted to leave the 
soviet union if reagan visited 
it went back and forth several times as the reagans and 
white house aides considered the dilemma one source said they 
didnt want to knuckle under to intimidation but they didnt want 
to hurt the ziemans either 
instead of making the visit the reagans toured the arbat mall 
in downtown moscow the ziemans waited patiently until it was clear 
the president would not be coming 
the ziemans 12yearold daughter vera had appealed to the 
reagans for help in getting her and her family out of the soviet 
union 
americans who meet her unfailingly note veras uncanny 
resemblance to little orphan annie with her curly hair and cherub 
cheeks she speaks english with a british accent as taught by her 
mother she calls herself a lifelong refusenik because the 
family has been refused permission to emigrate virtually since her 
birth 
my name is vera zieman she wrote the reagans last month 
but everybody calls me moscows orphan annie 
my elder sister who lives in boston now tries desperately to 
help us get permission to leave the ussr vera wrote the reagans 
i wish and wish i could do something too so i made up my mind to 
venture to ask you for help 
she told of her familys efforts to emigrate and of the 
hardships her parents have suffered since becoming refuseniks her 
father who has worked as a plumber since losing his scientific 
post recently suffered a mysterious brain ailment that has 
affected his vision and balance during his hospitalization for 
that condition he contracted hepatitis and has been confined to 
bed although he got up to attend the reagan reception on monday 
matlock a career diplomat who has dealt with the soviets 
throughout much of his professional career refused to respond to 
queries about the incident but other sources who participated in 
planning the reagans visit said the blunt warning came from 
bessmertnykh one of matlocks principal contacts in the soviet 
government 
several sources confirmed all or part of this account on 
condition they not be identified by name 
a white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the white house 
would not comment on the report and soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov responded only indirectly saying 
the reagans were free to meet with whom they please 
yuri zieman veras father was asked at a reception reagan gave 
for soviet dissidents and refuseniks monday whether he thought a 
reagan visit would have made it more difficult for them to 
emigrate a goal they have sought since 1977 
how do we know he told reportersthats a very 
sovietlike statement like dont try to emigrate dont believe 
in god 
a white house advance party made a discreet visit to the 
ziemans home in a shabby apartment building in southwest moscow to 
let them know the reagans might come to see them they made no 
commitment 
it was not clear how the soviets learned of the plan although 
the kgb keeps close watch on american diplomats soviet dissidents 
and refuseniks soviet jews who have been refused permission to 
leave the country 
zieman a former computer scientist who lost his job when he 
applied for an exit visa 11 years ago has been told he is not 
allowed to leave for security reasons although he contends he 
never had access to state secrets and has no information that could 
threaten soviet security

in 1953 they scoffed when sir winston churchill 
proposed a summit conference between east and west today as 
britons buy the final volume of his biography theyre not scoffing 
the last volume of martin gilberts winston s churchill 
which goes on sale today illustrates the foresight that often 
placed the british statesman so far ahead of events that he invited 
ridicule 
the work recounts how churchill tried to bring about a summit 
meeting similar to the one this week in moscow britains wartime 
prime minister even coined the term summit 
yet he was rebuffed by his own cabinet and president dwight d 
eisenhower 
churchill who also foresaw the nazi threat the end of british 
global preeminence and the atomic bomb wrote to eisenhower in 
1953 pleading for a summit with the soviet leadership that took 
over after joseph stalin died 
but it was the height of the cold war and eisenhower replied 
that a summit would serve only the soviet propaganda mill 
in a speech to parliament churchill envisioned a summit held 
in a secluded setting in which there might be a general feeling 
among those gathered together that they might do something better 
than tear the human race including themselves to bits 
anthony eden churchills foreign secretary viewed the summit 
offer as a signal of weakness to the soviets and wrote in his 
diary it must be long in history since any one speech did so 
much damage to its own side 
churchill also asked eisenhower to approve a message to 
vyacheslav molotov the soviet foreign minister offering to go to 
moscow for informal talks 
the president rejected the idea expressing a bit of 
astonishment and the suspicion that anything the kremlin could 
misinterpret as weakness or overeagerness on our part would 
militate against success in negotiation 
churchill left office in 1955 and died 10 years later aged 91 
having failed to bring about a summit 
gilbert said in an intervew churchill had a belief which is 
now if you like fulfilled in moscow a belief that if only the 
leaders could sit down together progress could be made 
this was belittled by all the politicians as absurd and 
fanciful and yet reagan and gorbachev are sitting down new 
agreements have been signed a whole new atmosphere has been 
created and churchill set it all out in 1953 1954 and 1955 to 
eisenhower 
critics have acclaimed never despair the final volume and 
compared the biography to the rise and fall of the roman empire 
it fills eight volumes and 8664 pages and took 25 years to 
write still to come are 13 companion volumes of documents 
with the companion volumes winston s churchill was in the 
guinness book of records as the worlds longest biography even 
before the final 1359page installment was published in britain 
houghton mifflin soon will issue it in the united states 
gilbert 51 is an oxford university historian he began as an 
assistant to churchills son randolph who wrote the first two 
volumes and took over when randolph died in 1967 
shining through the final volume covering churchills last 20 
years are his qualities of doggedness eloquence sense of history 
and unflagging gallantry to his monarch colleagues and even 
political foes 
he was a prodigious author but never one to kiss and tell 
he sent the manuscript of his wartime memoirs to eisenhower asking 
if there was anything ike did not want mentioned 
the final lines of gilberts book quoting a letter to churchill 
from his daughter mary soames are a fitting commentary on his 
leadership in the dark years of world war ii 
in addition to all the feelings a daughter has for a loving 
generous father i owe you what every englishman woman and child 
does liberty itself

you fly in on the state airline aeroflot make 
your way through kgb passport and customs control and catch a ride 
downtown with a driver from the state travel monopoly intourist 
gum the huge stateowned department store is packed but not 
because theres a sale on there are no sales the prices are fixed 
by thats right the state 
thats life in the ussr this is after all a communist state 
but less so it seems every day that perestroika survives 
if the buzzword of the 1980s in america has been 
entrepreneurship the key word here is cooperatives 
under the banner of perestroika the gorbachev campaign to 
restructure the nations stagnant economy authorities last week 
acted on new laws that will encourage the expansion of 
cooperatives economic units akin in many ways to the small 
business sector of the united states except that all employees are 
coowners and thus share in the profits 
profits 
profits have come to the soviet union and thus profit motive 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov said last week that 14000 
cooperatives were formed in the first 18 months they were 
permitted with another 6000 formed in the past three months the 
cooperative system he said optimistically in a short time can 
solve the most severe problems of perestroika the demand of the 
population for goods and services 
perestroika signals a dramatic evolution in the communist 
economy that has built a huge military might and an ominous 
bureaucracy but little in the way of consumer services that people 
in the west have come to take for granted 
foreigners who live here send out to helsinki for the finer 
things in life when the train from finland arrives at leningrad 
station here it is loaded down with the fruits of the capitalist 
west such as dishwashing detergent modern ranges fresh produce 
and big macs 
soviet citizens have neither the income nor the hard currency 
nor the authority to order out instead they shop in stateowned 
shops where variety is rare and the stock is either overpriced or 
depleted as a rule quality is nothing to brag about either 
perestroika is already in deep trouble not the least because 
economic restructuring has brought the uncertainties of layoffs and 
future price increases without any of the rewards of a true 
consumer economy 
change has been a long time coming to the soviet union the 
local press has come to dismiss the brezhnevtochernenko era 
19641985 as the period of stagnation that said the moscow 
news a statecontrolled paper that takes advantage of glasnost 
the democratic companion of perestroika to push the economic 
reforms on the front page has run reams about cooperatives 
its the hot topic in town at least among the intellectuals and 
the foreign community in new york you ask a cabbie to take you to 
elaines maybe in moscow you ask for a cooperative and if youre 
lucky you make your way to one of the new restaurants owned by 
its employees who pocket the profit and thus have an incentive to 
create an attractive dinner or sew an attractive dress 
for the past six months the way to the vavilova market has 
become lined with wooden stalls and card tables as vendors sell 
whatever they can make or get their hands on one young lady is 
modeling a redandwhite striped apron and has a dozen on the table 
starting at 30 rubles about 50 a fellow across the way has got 
his hands on some stylish western blue jeans for sale he says 
at 130 rubles 200 a months pay for many muscovites 
after dinner walk through the arbat shopping mall or even red 
square and you see artists selling their portraits of st basils 
cathedral or the lenin mausoleum they implore they barter they 
discount they would be capitalists or eccentrics at the 
pontevecchio in florence or in ghirardelli square in san 
francisco but in moscow they call themselves cooperatives 
one new coop restaurant in the northern section of moscow 
displays the stickers of major credit cards familiar in the west 
and tries to make foreigners pay with plastic an open violation of 
currency laws that forbid practically all private trade in hard 
currency 
prices at the restaurant double at midnight and one unwary 
foursome found themselves stuck with a 98ruble 170 bill for 
dinner outrageous by soviet standards but more and more common as 
coops learn the demand is there at practically any price in this 
supplystarved economy 
this turn in the local economy is not without controversy or 
opposition and many are the residents who recall khrushchevera 
reform efforts and expect this goround to goround too the 
current edition of the moscow news has a piece whose frontpage 
teaser says worker demands a revision of the law on state 
enterprise 
the worker identified as steelmaker mikhail koptev complained 
in an open letter to the supreme soviet that there are people 
putting roadblocks before the cooperative economy last week the 
supreme soviet always your basic rubber stamp in this oneparty 
society rebelled against a proposal to encourage cooperatives and 
insisted on a shift in the tax laws that would allow employees to 
keep a greater percentage of the profits 
thats right they were considering tax breaks 
tax breaks 
it seems like curious business for soviet communists

soviet media are highlighting cases the kremlin 
perceives as us human rights abuses in an apparent bid to 
counterbalance president reagans meeting with dissidents and 
refuseniks 
the official news agency tass carried a critical commentary in 
advance of reagans meeting monday at spaso house quoting deputy 
foreign minister vladimir petrovsky as saying such an action is 
hardly aimed at improving understanding between the soviet union 
and the united states 
the communist party newspaper pravda told its readers that 
although the united states is a land of scientific and 
technological marvels it is also a land of homelessness hunger 
and repression of minorities 
on a day when news of the summit meeting dominated the pages of 
the newspaper it printed a photograph of blacks in shabby clothes 
lining up for a free thanksgiving day meal at lafayette park in 
washington dc noting it was across the street from the white 
house 
on the bottom of the same page it printed a story about leonard 
peltier an american indian convicted of killing two fbi agents in 
1975 at the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota 
peltiers case has been cited by soviet officials as an example 
of us human rights violations civil rights lawyer william 
kunstler said recently that the treatment of american indians in 
the united states should be raised as a human rights issue at the 
summit 
radio moscow in one of its newscasts monday mentioned a may 23 
report by a panel of 40 prominent americans that said minorities in 
the united states were failing to make progress in efforts to 
achieve full participation in the life and prosperity of the 
nation 
tass also publicized a news conference monday by four americans 
who came to moscow to speak about alleged us human rights abuses 
involving minorities the four wanted to make human rights part 
of the agenda at the moscow summit and provide a balanced 
view said one of the participants lawyer karen parker in an 
interview with the associated press 
the tass commentary said the soviet government is seriously 
concerned about the human rights situation in the united states 
especially discrimination against national minorities 
persecution of people because of their political views and the 
passing of death sentences on minors 
it also said that ideological disputes between the superpowers 
are inevitable but one cannot put up with the fact that the 
subject of human rights is exploited for purposes of whipping up 
hostility in interstate relations for impeding the processes of 
disarmament and detente 
the soviet peace committee was the setting for the news 
conference by the four american human rights activists but parker 
said they all paid their own way to moscow 
parker and indian rights activist anthony gonzales both of san 
francisco said that besides peltier the activists wanted to 
publicize the human rights cases of racial minorities the 
homeless the hungry institutionalized disabled people and those 
refugees and asylumseekers who have been forcibly returned to the 
country from which they fled

at the end of a day in which president reagan 
demonstrated his sympathy with soviet dissidents soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev cautioned against sermonizing that could 
sour superpower relations 
the general secretarys comments came at a state dinner hours 
after the presidents meeting with dissidents and jewish refuseniks 
drew terse comments from other soviet officials 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
said those who attended the emotionladen session with the 
president at the american ambassadors home were not the best of 
the soviet people 
he dismissed a question about whether the dissidents could face 
reprisals as a result of the meeting i met mr reagan today but 
i dont think i am going to be harmed in any way by just meeting 
him 
gorbachev in his toast at the dinner for the reagans monday 
night said we want to build contacts among people in all forms 
to expand and improve the quality of information and to develop 
ties in the spheres of science culture education sports and any 
other human endeavor 
but this should be done without interfering in domestic 
affairs without sermonizing or imposing ones views and ways 
without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for 
confrontation between states the soviet leader said 
reagan expressed hope that his push for improvements in human 
rights in the soviet union would get results under gorbachevs 
leadership 
ive come to moscow with this human rights agenda because as 
i suggested it is our belief that this is a moment of hope the 
new soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain 
freedoms and economic growth reagan said at spaso house during 
the meeting with dissidents and refuseniks 
reagan also visited the 13th century danilov monastery where 
monks practice the russian orthodox faith in the communist country 
there he told the monks the faith of your people has been 
tested and tempered in the crucible of hardship we may hope that 
perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper restructuring and 
that glasnost which means giving voice will also let loose a new 
chorus of belief 
our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to 
anyone anywhere and hope with you that soon all the many soviet 
religious communities including the ukrainian catholic and 
orthodox churches will soon be able to practice their religion 
freely and openly he said 
at the meeting of prominent dissidents reagan sat next to abe 
stollar the 73yearold american who came to the soviet union as a 
child in the 1930s and has battled since 1975 to get himself and 
his family out of the soviet union 
those at his table included lev timofeyev an activist released 
from prison last february tatyana zieman a jewish refusenik the 
rev modris plate a lutheran minister from latvia and pytras 
pakenas a lithuanian who is married to an american but cannot 
leave the country 
both gerasimov and vladimir petrovsky the deputy foreign 
minister said reagan was free to do what he wanted in the soviet 
union but petrovsky implied reagan had breached protocol by seeing 
the 100 or so soviets who are at odds with their countrys policies 
gorbachev could have seen anyone at the ussoviet summit in 
washington last december but took into account all nuances so 
the summit would be a success petrovsky said in remarks quoted by 
the news agency tass 
the american action of this kind is hardly aimed at improving 
understanding between the soviet union and the united states he 
said 
in washington six months ago gorbachev reacted heatedly when he 
was pressed by newspaper editors on his stand on human rights 
soviet officials have long told americans to mind their own 
business on the issue 
reagan and his wife nancy signed autographs during the session 
at which a few children roamed around the large dining room 
we are not so used to hearing such human words without any 
political statement said yuri zieman a former computer 
scientist who lost his job when he applied for an exit visa 11 
years ago 
zieman said there was no telling whether the session with reagan 
would expedite emigration how do we know

jw canty an american episcopal priest working 
against alcoholism and drug abuse in the soviet union could not 
get nancy reagan interested in his just say nyet campaign so 
hell try her husband 
canty 41 chairman of the sovietus joint conference on 
alcoholism and drug addiction wants to deliver a letter to 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev asking them 
to issue a joint statement on the need to fight addictions 
alcoholism and drug addiction is an extremely serious problem 
in both of our countries cantys letter says may history 
remember these days as a summit for sobriety 
one question canty thinks gorbachev and reagan should address is 
why the cultures in the two countries seem to spawn alcoholism a 
disease which robs both societies of their human resources 
why do these two countries share these drinking problems 
canty asked in both countries canty thinks there is a certain 
macho image associated with drinking 
canty has spent two years working on and off in the soviet union 
setting up the conference 
since 1986 canty has established an alcoholics anonymous 
chapter in moscow persuaded the moscow city government to give him 
a building for a fellowship house taken soviet physicians on a 
tour of the united states to study alcoholism and arranged for 
americans to visit the soviet union 
but the white house turned down cantys invitation to have mrs 
reagan visit the site of his soontobeopened fellowship house 
since 1981 mrs reagan has campaigned against drugs adopting the 
slogan just say no 
the fellowship house in downtown moscow will be a place for 
people to meet read in the library and see videos it will be a 
club to celebrate sobriety he said 
undeterred by the reaction of mrs reagans staff canty decided 
to solicit help from the superpower leaders in writing 
canty has already eaten dinner with gorbachev and received help 
from the soviet leaders aides who are committed to the countrys 
antidrinking policy since he took office gorbachev has raised 
the drinking age from 18 to 21 reduced the number of liquor stores 
and cut back on the production of alcohol 
gorbachev has challenged his people to do something but the 
followthrough has been a joke canty said the soviets say there 
are officially 43 million alcoholics in the country of about 284 
million but canty thinks the figure is closer to about 10 million 
the same as in the united states 
the communist party daily pravda reported on nov 15 1987 that 
there are more than 45 million registered alcoholics in the soviet 
union and that about 1 million of them need compulsory care there 
has been no official estimate of the number of unregistered 
alcoholics 
though a drug problem exists in the soviet union it is far less 
severe than in the united states canty said drugs like cocaine 
and crack are not prevalent here but russian women often abuse 
tranquilizers and teenagers sniff benzene he said 
canty acknowledges that people in the united states and the 
soviet union find his efforts to reach global peace through 
sobriety somewhat offbeat but he says he has been effective 
ive been told we are the first nonprofit joint venture he 
said 
the lowbudget conference is funded with money from foundations 
and gifts the soviet government has provided inkind help such as 
donating a building and paying for its doctors to travel abroad 
canty receives no money from the us government and declines to 
take a salary 
since 1986 canty has made seven trips to the soviet union and 
he has been here since january staying at the national hotel a 
plush historic building overlooking the kremlin he operates out of 
his hotel room 
the russians seem perplexed by his grassroots scotchtape 
operation he said the new party line is profit and here we 
are saying do this for free he said

dutch police on tuesday recovered 
three paintings including works by vincent van gogh and paul 
cezanne less than two weeks after they were stolen from this 
citys municipal museum police said 
three dutchmen were arrested when they tried to sell the 
19thcentury paintings in an amsterdam hotel said police spokesman 
klaas wilting 
the works whose combined worth has been estimated at up to 52 
million were recovered undamaged he told the associated press 
the art theft was the nations biggest ever 
wilting refused to disclose any further details of the hotel 
transaction 
he would also not say whether the three suspects were thought to 
include the burglars who smashed a museum window and stole the 
three works on may 20 
stolen were carnations a 1888 work by the dutch painter van 
gogh bottle with apples a still life painted in 1894 by the 
french master cezanne and the house of maitre billaud in 
nevers an 1874 painting by dutch artist johan jongkind 
museum director wim beeren said at the time that the theft was 
thought to have been commissioned by a private art lover since the 
paintings are virtually unsellable on the open market 
beeren said the record loss figure was in part due to the 
astronomical prices fetched recently by van gogh paintings at 
auctions 
last november an unidentified collector paid 53 million for 
van goghs irises at a new york auction 
eight months earlier the impressionist masters sunflowers 
was auctioned in london for 298 million 
however experts of the christies auction firm in london said 
soon after the amsterdam burglary that the three paintings were 
worth only 11 million 
the theft also sparked a public debate on the security of the 
dutch artistic collections critics said too little was being done 
to protect the nations art treasures from often highly 
professional thieves 
the predawn burglary on may 20 triggered only an electronic 
alarm at the museum which has 3200 artworks mostly modern but 
no night guard 
it took 20 minutes for police to arrive on the scene of the 
burglary reportedly because the museums private security company 
failed to immediately alert authorities

here is a transcript of president reagans remarks 
monday to the soviet dissidents and refuseniks who met with him at 
spaso house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thank you all and welcome to spaso house 
after the discussions weve just had i thought it might be 
appropriate for me to begin by letting you know why i so wanted 
this meeting to take place you see i wanted to convey to you that 
you have the prayers and support of the american people indeed of 
people throughout the world i wanted to convey this support to you 
that you might in turn convey it to others so that all those 
working for human rights throughout this vast land from the urals 
to kamchatka from the laptev sea to the caspian might be 
encouraged and take heart 
thank you in one capacity of course i speak as a head of 
government the united states views human rights as fundamental 
absolutely fundamental to our relationship with the soviet union 
and all nations from the outset of our administration weve 
stressed that an essential element in improving relations between 
the united states and the soviet union is human rights and soviet 
compliance with international covenants on human rights 
there have been hopeful signs indeed i believe this a hopeful 
time for your nation over the past three years more than 300 
political and religious prisoners have been released from labor 
camps fewer dissidents and believers have been put in prisons and 
mental hospitals and in recent months more people have been 
permitted to emigrate or reunite with their families 
the united states applauds these changes yet the basic 
standards the soviet union agreed to almost 13 years ago in the 
helsinki accords or a generation ago in the universal declaration 
of human rights still need to be met if i may id like to share 
with you the main aims of our human rights agenda during this 
summit meeting here in moscow 
freedom of religion in the words of the universal declaration 
of human rights everyone has the right to freedom of thought 
conscience and religion im hopeful the soviet government will 
permit all the peoples of the soviet union to worship their creator 
as they themselves see fit in liberty 
freedom of speech again in the words of the universal 
declaration of human rights everyone has the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression it is my fervent hope for you and your 
country that there will soon come a day when no one need fear 
prison for offenses that involve nothing more than the spoken or 
written word 
freedom of travel ive told the general secretary how heartened 
we are that during the past year the number of those permitted to 
emigrate has risen were encouraged as well that the number of 
those permitted to leave for short trips often family visits has 
gone up 
and yet the words of the universal declaration go beyond these 
steps everyone has the right to leave any country including his 
own and to return to his own country it is our hope that soon 
there will be complete freedom of travel 
in my particular in particular ive noted in my talks here the 
many who have been denied the right to emigrate on the grounds that 
they held secret knowledge even though their secret work had ended 
years before and their socalled secrets had long since become 
either public knowledge or obsolete such cases must be rationally 
reviewed 
and finally institutional changes to make progress permanent 
ive come to moscow with this human rights agenda because as i 
suggested it is our belief that this is a moment of hope the new 
soviet leaders appear to grasp the connection between certain 
freedoms and economic growth the freedom to keep the fruits of 
ones own labor for example is a freedom that the present reforms 
seem to be enlarging 
we hope that one freedom will lead to another and another that 
the soviet government will understand that it is the individual who 
is always the source of economic creativity the inquiring mind 
that produces a technical breakthrough the imagination that 
conceives of new products and markets and that in order for the 
individual to create we must have a sense he must have a sense of 
just that his own individuality his own self worth he must 
sense that others respect it and yes that his nation respects 
him respects him enough to grant him all his human rights 
this ths as i said is our hope that whatever the future may 
bring the commitment of the united states will nevertheless remain 
unshakeable on human rights on the fundamental dignity of the 
human person there can be no relenting for now we must work for 
more always more 
and here i would like to speak to you not as a head of 
government but as a man a fellow human being i came here hoping 
to do what i could to give you strength yet i already know it is 
you who have strengthened me you who have given me a message to 
carry back 
while we press for human rights through diplomatic channels you 
press with your very lives day in and day out year after year 
risking your jobs your homes your all 
if i may i want to give you one thought from my heart coming 
here and being with you and looking into your faces i have to 
believe that the history of this troubled century will indeed be 
redeemed in the eyes of god and man and that freedom will truly 
come to all for what injustice can withstand your strength and 
what can conquer your prayers 
and so i say with pushkin its time my friend its time 
the heart begs for peace the days fly past its time its time 
could i play a little trick on you and say something that isnt 
written here sometimes when im faced with an unbeliever an 
atheist i am tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner 
that one could ever serve and when weve finished eating that 
magnificent dinner to ask him if he believes theres a cook 
thank you all and god bless you 
nancy and i have to leave you were going to have a little talk 
with the general secretary

here is a transcript of president reagans speech 
monday at the danilov monastery 
 
its a very great pleasure to visit this beautiful monastery and 
to have a chance to meet some of the people who have helped make 
its return to the russian orthodox church a reality i am also 
addressing in spirit the 35 million believers whose personal 
contributions made this magnificent restoration possible 
its been said that an icon is a window between heaven and earth 
through which the believing eye can peer into the beyond one 
cannot look at the magnificent icons created and recreated here 
under the direction of father zinon without experiencing the deep 
faith that lives in the hearts of the people of this land like the 
saints and martyrs depicted in these icons the faith of your 
people has been tested and tempered in the crucible of hardship 
but in that suffering it has grown strong ready now to embrace 
with new hope the beginnings of a second christian millennium 
we in our country share this hope for a new age of religious 
freedom in the soviet union we share the hope that this monastery 
is not an end in itself but the symbol of a new policy of 
religious tolerance that will extend to all peoples of all faith 
we pray that the return of this monastery signals a willingness to 
return to believers the thousands of other houses of worship which 
are now closed boarded up or used for secular purposes 
there are many ties of faith that bind your country and mine we 
have in america many churches many creeds that feel a special 
kinship with their fellow believers here protestant catholic 
jewish orthodox and islamic they are united with believers in 
this country in many ways especially in prayer 
our people feel it keenly when religious freedom is denied to 
anyone anywhere and hope with you that soon all the many soviet 
religious communities that are now prevented from registering will 
band all together including the ukrainian catholic and orthodox 
churches will soon be able to practice their religion freely and 
openly and instruct their children in and outside the home in the 
fundamentals of their faith we dont know if this first thaw will 
be followed by a resurgent spring of religious liberty we dont 
know but we may hope 
we may hope that perestroika will be accompanied by a deeper 
restructuring a deeper conversion a metenota metenoya 
i should say a change in heart and that glasnost which means 
giving voice will also let loose a new chorus of belief singing 
praise to the god that gave us life 
theres a beautiful passage that id just like to read if i may 
its from one of this countrys great writers and believers 
aleksandr solzhenitsyn about the faith that is as elemental to 
this land as the dark and fertile soil he wrote when you travel 
the byroads of central russia you begin to understand the secrets 
of the pacifying russian countryside it is in the churches they 
lift their belltowers graceful shapely all different high over 
mundane timber and thatch from villages that are cutoff and 
invisible to each other they soar to the same heaven people were 
always selfish and often unkind but the evening chimes used to 
ring out floating over the villages fields and woods reminding 
them that they must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give 
time and thought to eternity 
in our prayers we may keep that image in mind the thought that 
the bells may ring again sounding throughout moscow and across the 
countryside clamoring for joy in their newfound freedom well ive 
talked long enough im sure you have many questions and many 
things on your mind and im anxious to hear what you have to say

here is a transcript of general secretary mikhail 
s gorbachevs toast at the state dinner monday night for president 
and mrs reagan 
esteemed mr president esteemed mrs reagan ladies and 
gentlemen comrades i welcome you in the moscow kremlin for five 
centuries it has been the site of events that constituted 
milestones in the life of our state decisions crucial to the fate 
of our nation were made here the very environment around us a call 
for responsibility to our times and contemporaries to the present 
and to the future it is here that we wish to emphasize the 
importance of the newly discovered truth that it is no longer 
possible to settle international disputes by force of arms our 
awareness of the realities of the present day world has led us to 
that conclusion 
i like the notion of realism and i also like the fact that you 
mr president have lately been uttering it more and more often 
normal and indeed durable sovietamerican relations which so 
powerfully affect the worlds political climate are only 
conceivable within the framework of realism thanks to realism for 
all our differences we have succeeded in arriving at a joint 
conclusion which though very simple is of historic importance a 
nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought other 
conclusions followed with inexorable logic one of them is whether 
there is any need for weapons which cannot be used without 
destroying ourselves and indeed all of mankind i believe the 
realization of this became reykjaviks pivotal idea 
our warsaw treaty allies firmly adhere to this position this is 
our powerful support in all matters related to nuclear disarmament 
they have given the soviet leadership a clear mandate to negotiate 
radical nuclear arms limitations and reductions with the united 
states my talks with leaders of socialist countries and with 
authoritative representatives of other nations make it clear to me 
that there is a common desire to overcome military confrontation 
and to end the race in both nuclear and conventional arms 
to this it should be added that a realistic approach is making a 
way for itself in all directions and on all continents and the 
idea of resolving todays problems solely by political means is 
gaining increasing authority there is an everbroadening desire of 
the most diverse political and social forces for dialogue for 
exchanges for a better knowledge of each other and for mutual 
understanding if this is indeed so if this is the will of the 
peoples an effort is needed to ensure that the stocks of the 
ferment of realistic policies keep growing and never run out for 
that it is essential to understand each other better to take into 
account the specific features of life in various countries the 
historical conditions that shape them and the choice made by their 
peoples i recall the words you once spoke mr president and i 
quote the only way to resolve differences is to understand 
them unquote how very true let me just add that seeking to 
resolve differences should not mean an end to being different the 
diversity of the world is a powerful wellspring of mutual 
enrichment both spiritual and material 
ladies and gentlemen comrades the word perestroika does 
not sound anachronistic even within these ancient walls for 
renewal of society humanization of life and elevated ideals are 
at all times and everywhere in the interests of the people and of 
each individual and when this happens especially in a great 
country it is important to understand the meaning of what it is 
going through it is this desire to understand the soviet union 
that we are now seeing abroad and we regard this as a good sign 
because we do want to be understood correctly this is also 
important for civilized international relations everyone who wants 
to do business with us will find it useful to know how soviet 
people see themselves we see ourselves even more convinced that 
our socialist choice was correct and we cannot conceive of our 
country developing without socialism based on any other 
fundamental values our program is more democracy more glasnost 
more social justice with full prosperity and high moral standards 
our goal is maximum freedom for man for the individual and for 
society 
internationally we see ourselves as part of an integral 
civilization where each has the right to a social and political 
choice to a worthy and equal place within the community of 
nations on issues of peace and progress we believe in the primacy 
of universal human values and regard the preservation of peace as 
the top priority and that is why we advocate the establishment of 
a comprehensive system of international security as a condition for 
the survival of mankind 
linked with this is also our desire to revive and enhance the 
role of the united nations on the basis of the original goals which 
the soviet union and the united states together with their allies 
enshrined in the charter of that organization its very name is 
symbolic the united nations united in their determination to 
prevent new tragedies of war to banish war from international 
relations and to affirm just principles securing a worthy life for 
any nation whether large or small strong or weak rich or poor 
we want to build contacts among people in all forms to expand and 
improve the quality of information and to develop ties in the 
spheres of science culture education sports and any other human 
endeavor but this should be done without interfering in domestic 
affairs without sermonizing or imposing ones views and ways 
without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for 
confrontation between states in short our time offers great scope 
for action in the humanitarian field nations should understand 
each other better know the truth about each other and free 
themselves from bias and prejudice

as far as we know most americans just like us want to get rid 
of the demon of nuclear war but they just like us just like all 
people on earth are becoming increasingly concerned over the risk 
of environmental disaster such a risk can only be averted if we 
act together 
increasingly urgent is the truly global problem of the economic 
state of the world in the north and south in the west and east 
of this planet the economic foundation of civilization will be 
destroyed unless a way is found to put an end to the squandering of 
funds and resources for war and destruction unless the problem of 
debt is settled and world finances are stabilized unless the world 
market becomes truly worldwide by incorporating all states and 
nations on an equal footing 
it is across this spectrum of issues that we approach 
international affairs and of course our relations with the united 
states of america we are motivated by an awareness of the 
realities and imperatives of the nuclear and space age the age of 
sweeping technological revolution when the human race had turned 
out to be both omnipotent and mortal it was this awareness that 
engendered the new thinking which has made possible a conceptual 
and practical breakthrough in relations between us as well 
mr president this meeting while taking stock of a 
fundamentally important period in sovietamerican relations has to 
consolidate our achievements and give new impetus for the future 
never before have nuclear missile been destroyed now we have an 
unprecedented treaty and our two countries will be performing for 
the first time ever this overture of nuclear disarmament the 
performance had to be flawless the soviet union and the united 
states are acting as guarantors of the afghan political settlement 
this too is a precedent of tremendous importance as guarantors 
our two countries face a very responsible period and we hope they 
both will go through it in a befitting manner the whole world is 
watching to see how we are going to act in this situation our main 
task continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50percent 
reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the abm 
treaty in our talks today you and i devoted a lot of attention 
and with good cause to discussing the entire range of these 
problems 
mr president we are expected to ensure that the moscow summit 
open up new horizons in sovietamerican dialogue in relations 
between the ussr and the us for the benefit of our two nations and 
the entire world this is worth any effort and any amount of good 
will 
to cooperation between the soviet union and the united states of 
america to their better mutual knowledge and mutual understanding 
i wish good health and happiness to you mr president to mrs 
nancy reagan and to all our distinguished guests

the reagans dined on champagne and caviar in the 
citadel of communism the gorbachevs set aside their campaign 
against drinking to serve the best of russian wines the evening 
sun poured through floortoceiling windows 
all glittered when the gorbachevs played host to the visiting 
american president and his wife in the iconlavished splendor of 
the kremlins hall of facets then led them on a tour toured the 
fortresss private rooms where they could have stayed as guests if 
they had wished

frescoed ceilings of the opulent chamber drew the entire communist 
party hierarchy and a select group of moscow intellectuals 
scientists a cosmonaut and russian orthodox clergy 
soviet leader mikhail s and president reagan lifted their 
crystal glasses of georgian wine to toast their success in 
narrowing the gap between the superpowers and to wish for future 
triumphs in learning to deal with and respect each other 
the elegant dining hall was awash in light from the windows 
letting in the late spring evening sunshine and the fully 
illuminated chandeliers that adorn the hall 
silver candlesticks raising tall white tapers and sprays of pink 
roses decorated tables spread with salmon pink linen 
the kremlin pomp was more subtle than decembers white house 
state dinner for the visiting gorbachevs where the women wore 
formallength gowns and the american men sported blacktie attire 
at that occasion gorbachev and his advisers showed up in 
business suits causing eyebrows to lift in social circles 
on the occasion of the reagans visit the hosts set aside their 
antialcohol inclinations to treat their guests to domestic wines 
champagne and cognac from the southern republics of georgia and 
armenia to go with a dinner that began with caviar turkey fillets 
and puff pastry and progressed through soups and courses of veal 
and perch 
the president gave gorbachev a video cassette of an american 
film friendly persuasion regaling the mostly soviet gathering 
with a lengthy description of the civil war story but promising not 
to spoil its outcome 
fourteen americans were invited to the state dinner including 
secretary of state george shultz us ambassador jack matlock and

of the afghan accords signed in geneva on april 14 noting their 
cooperation is of immense significance for their future

both take pride in them reagan said as the first lady in a red 
print dress and heavy gold necklace listened from gorbachevs

nikita khrushchev used to say jazz gave him gas 
but no one seems to know what effect it has on mikhail gorbachev 
tonight pianist dave brubeck plans to find out when he gives 
the general secretary and his wife raisa a taste of take five 
and other american jazz classics 
one thing is for sure says brubeck the reagans like jazz they 
have chosen him to perform with his quintet at a state dinner for 
the gorbachevs at spaso house the us ambassadors residence 
where the reagans are staying during the summit 
the reagans really seem to appreciate american music in 
general nancy seems to know all the standards you can see her 
mouthing the words the grayhaired 67yearold brubeck said in 
an interview monday 
as for the president a former hollywood actor brubeck recalled 
that at a feb 21 performance at the white house for governors 
he told me how much he loved the big bands and how much they were 
a part of american history 
brubeck is no stranger to the halls of power he was the first 
jazz musician to play at the white house and has entertained every 
president since john f kennedy 
he met the gorbachevs but didnt have a chance to talk to them 
or play for them at the previous summit state dinner at the white 
house last december that dinner produced one of the most memorable 
moments of the washington summit the gorbachevs singing along as 
the american classical pianist van cliburn played the russian 
standard moscow nights 
asked if he would follow in van cliburns footsteps with the 
dixieland jazz version of the song renamed midnight in moscow 
brubeck said were prepared to play it if someone asks but its 
been done so many times 
but in typical brubeckian manner if its played itll be with 
a twist in fivefour rhythm it can be done he assured a 
doubting reporter 
in honor of the occasion brubeck has dug up the real 
ambassadors a song he wrote in 1958 for a musical that featured 
trumpeter louis armstrong running the world for a day 
although the gorbachevs wont hear it because brubeck plans to 
play only an instrumental version of the song one line speaks of 
armstrong using music to bring peace the next time around its 
a session where we jam the blues khrushchev pounding both his 
shoes couldnt have the final say if i was king for a day 
khrushchev who pounded a shoe on a desk at the united nations 
in 1960 was no jazz lover when i hear jazz its as if i had 
gas on the stomach he said in december 1963 
at the other extreme yuri andropov the former kgb chief who 
led the soviet union from november 1982 until his death in february 
1984 was reputed to be a jazz fan 
but although mrs gorbachev has showed up at several classical 
music concerts little is known about the kremlin couples musical 
tastes 
i keep asking everyone if gorbachev likes jazz but no one 
seems to know says brubecks 36yearold son chris who plays 
bass guitar and trombone in the group they all say andropov 
liked jazz and had a huge record collection 
the elder brubeck who says hes played in most countries of the 
world from the dance halls to all the joints during his 
50year career believes jazz is a unique medium for espousing the 
american ideal of freedom 
to play jazz you have to have tremendous discipline and you 
are expected to use it in a free way theres no art form that 
represents america better than jazz he said 
and to many jazz lovers there is no single jazz standard better 
known than take five brubecks 1958 tune that was the first 
jazz single to go gold 
the wilton conn resident gave soviets who had heard him only 
on voice of america shortwave broadcasts and records a chance to 
hear him in person in march and april of last year he played 13 
concerts in moscow leningrad and tallinn the capital of soviet 
estonia 
the soviet record label melodiya plans to release a recording 
from last years tour it has already come out in the united 
states under the title moscow night

religious faith in the soviet union is reviving 
slowly in a land where stateimposed atheism has long held sway 
but it is a slow emergence and the church hierarchy is cautious 
as evidence that the atmosphere is changing church state and 
party officials cite the return to the church of the 13th century 
danilov monastery the promise of a new law relaxing stalinera 
restrictions on worship and the release from prison and labor camps 
of religious dissidents 
the dissidents cautiously agree still they have asked president 
reagan to join them in prayer wednesday for an estimated 200 people 
they say still are prisoners because of the beliefs 
reagan in a visit to moscows oldest monastery monday paid 
tribute to the orthodox faith that next week will mark its 1000th 
anniversary 
religious life still is strictly regulated by the stalinist 
legislation on cults which deprives us of the possibility of 
uniting in religious community without barriers to own houses of 
worship study and distribute the bible and teach our children in 
sunday school seven religious dissidents said in a statement to 
reagan 
we ask you to give us the great honor of your presence at a 
joint prayer for the freeing of prisoners of faith they said 
dissidents led by former political prisoners father gleb 
yakunin and layman alexander ogorodnikov and others also seek 
recognition for the underground ukrainian catholic church and 
return to the orthodox church of the pechersky monastery in kiev 
the countrys oldest 
reagan told monks at the danilov monastery that he hoped the 
church bells silenced by repression might someday be clamoring 
for joy in their newfound freedom he did not say whether he 
could accept their invitation 
he expressed the hope that ukrainian catholic believers and 
others might soon be able to openly practice their faith 
orthodoxy for centuries the dominant faith of russia was 
closely identified with the czarist government and suffered severe 
repression after the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or converted to 
government use priests were exiled or killed and in 1927 under 
dictator josef v stalin authorities passed strict laws prohibiting 
charitable activities religious education of the young and 
requiring registration of all religious organizations with the 
government 
those strictures remain in force today 
in a meeting with patriarch pimen of moscow and all russia on 
april 29 soviet communist party leader mikhail s gorbachev 
criticized the tragic developments of the stalin years and 
promised to ease restrictions on the church in the new legislation 
that is being developed 
pimen pledged full support to the architect of perestroika 
and the herald of new political thinking the meeting between the 
ailing church leader and gorbachev the son of a religious farm 
woman was the first of its kind since 1943 
there is no official count of believers in the soviet union but 
the number is thought to be in the tens of millions perhaps as 
many as 90 million including jews and moslems 
besides the orthodox church soviet christians include eastern 
rite and roman catholics and baptists pentacostalists and other 
protestants some members of those groups fear that the easing of 
restrictions on the orthodox church will not extend to them 
the majority of churchgoers still are middleage or older but 
young people are increasingly attending services orthodox priests 
say they receive many requests to be baptized by young people who 
know little about the faith but are searching for something to 
give meaning to their lives 
in news conferences and interviews with the official press 
church officials recently have for the first time cautiously 
criticized the existing laws and expressed confidence that the new 
legislation will ease the restrictions 
some prominent soviets such as historian dmitri likhachev have 
come to the defense of the church publicly praising its 
contribution to the unification of the russian state and the 
development of art and culture 
yakunin earlier this year called for pimen to step down as 
patriarch saying the orthodox church needed a more active leader 
to take advantage of gorbachevs policies 
but others such as ogorodnikov are deeply suspicious of the 
entire church hierarchy and believe that any official must be 
thoroughly compromised to reach a prominent church position

here is a transcript of president reagans toast 
at monday nights state dinner at the kremlin 
mr general secretary i want to thank you again for the 
hospitality that weve encountered this evening and at every turn 
since our arrival in moscow we appreciate deeply the personal 
effort that you and mrs gorbachev and all of your associates have 
expended on our behalf 
today has been a busy day i want to thank you for the 
opportunity to meet with so many divergent members of soviet 
society as you know i traveled to danilov and met there with the 
clergy of that ancient monastery and later in the day had the most 
interesting exchanges with other members of soviet society as spaso 
house these meetings only confirmed mr general secretary the 
feelings of admiration and warmth that americans harbor for the 
peoples of the soviet union 
as wartime allies we came to know you in a special way but in 
a broader sense the american people like the rest of the world 
admire the saga of the peoples of the soviet union the clearing of 
the forest the struggle to build a society the evolution into a 
modern state and the struggle against hitlers armies 
there are other ways too that we know you happy or sad my 
beloved you are beautiful says one of your folksongs as 
beautiful as a russian song as beautiful as a russian soul as 
expressed in the great music architecture art we need only look 
about us this evening and literature that over many centuries 
youve given the world we have beheld the beauty and majesty of 
your peoples national experience and without belittling the 
serious business before us or the fundamental issues that separate 
our governments i hope youll permit me tonight to say that in 
the eyes of the american people your people truly are as the song 
the folksong suggests a people of heart and mind a people to 
use our vernacular with soul and thats why we believe there is 
common ground between our two peoples and why it is our duty to 
find common ground for our two governments 
over the next three days general secretary gorbachev and i will 
review what has been accomplished over the past three years and 
what our two nations might accomplish together in the months to 
come we have a great deal to discuss on both accounts what we 
have achieved is a good beginning we have taken the first step 
toward deep reductions of our nuclear arsenals we have taken the 
first step toward dealing with the reality that much of the tension 
and mistrust between our two countries arises from the very 
different concepts of the fundamental rights and role of the 
individual in society we have taken the first step to build that 
network of personal relationships and understanding between 
societies between people that are crucial to dispelling dangerous 
misconceptions and stereotypes 
these are good first steps mr general secretary and we can 
both take pride in them but as i said they are just a start 
nuclear arsenals remain too large the fighting continues 
needlessly tragically in too many regions of the globe the 
vision of freedom and cooperation enshrined in the helsinki final 
act remains unrealized the american and soviet peoples are getting 
to know each better but not well enough 
mr general secretary you and i are meeting now for the fourth 
time in three years a good deal more often than our predecessors 
and this has allowed our relationship to differ from theirs in more 
than a quantitative state or sense we have established the kind of 
working relationship i think we both had in mind when we first met 
in geneva weve been candid about our differences but sincere in 
sharing a common objective and working hard together to draw closer 
to it its easy to disagree and much harder to find areas where 
we can agree we and our two governments have both gotten into the 
habit of looking for those areas we found more than we expected i 
intend to pursue the search for common ground during the months 
left to me as president when i pass the job on to my successor i 
intend to tell him it is a search that must be continued based on 
the achievements of the last few years i will also tell him it is 
a search that can succeed

democrat presidential frontrunner michael dukakis 
promised black supporters he would give jesse jackson a role in his 
expected fall campaign against george bush and said he was 
counting on jacksons support 
were going to have as united a democratic party as weve ever 
had dukakis said after a memorial day breakfast with about 90 
black supporters from across the country 
i do not see any deep divisions with jackson he said after 
the session 
neither of us wants four more years of what weve had the past 
eight said the massachusetts governor 
the meeting was closed to the media but described by 
participants as a frank and cordial discussion of what dukakis 
needs to do to win the support of jacksons black constituency 
jackson himself campaigning in new jersey said he didnt want 
his support isolated by race but he spoke kindly of dukakis 
overtures to the black community 
he has an obligation to reach out said jackson 
dukakis also attended a memorial day service and met at the 
statehouse with argentine president raul alfonsin the two met two 
years ago when alfonsin was in massachusetts and they exchanged 
warm greetings after the private meeting 
dukakis was to tend to state business today and attend 
receptions in baltimore tonight 
he was to be back at the statehouse wednesday before heading to 
california new jersey new mexico and montana in the week left 
until the june 7 primaries in those states which are expected to 
give dukakis a lock on the nomination 
although participants in the monday gathering were unanimous in 
predicting jackson would support dukakis in the fall the session 
was designed partly to plot strategy for seeking black support 
regardless of jacksons role 
he showed his compassion and his understanding of the plight 
of black americans former new orleans mayor dutch morial said 
and he said dukakis affirmative action record as governor and his 
commitments to economic opportunity health care and housing would 
appeal to black voters 
the record is an excellent one said thomasina reed of los 
angeles a potential dukakis delegate 
participants said dukakis promised to offer some jackson 
campaign aides jobs in the fall campaign and also promised that 
blacks and other minorities would have major roles in a dukakis 
administration 
very clearly the presence of black americans in this campaign 
is going to have to be expanded said charlene drew jarvis a 
member of the district of columbia city council we got that 
commitment from today from mike dukakis 
dukakis was not specific about what role he believed jackson 
should have he is not expected to offer jackson the no 2 spot on 
the ticket 
what kind of role would i play if i came in second and he came 
in first dukakis asked rhetorically i would be out there 
working for a democratic victory 
jackson too said he expected to have a big role at the 
convention and a big role this fall but added that role has 
not been determined 
longtime dukakis supporter joseph warren who organized the 
meeting said black dukakis supporters with ties to jackson aides 
would hold frequent talks with them in the month leading into the 
july convention

once again mr general secretary i want to extend my thanks 
for your hospitality i also hope youll permit me to mention that 
as you have been a gracious host weve tried to be gracious guests 
by bringing along some small expressions of our gratitude theres 
one gift in particular that i wanted to mention not only in view 
of my own former profession but because it has i think something 
important to say to us about what is under way this week in moscow 
it is a film not as well known as some but an american classic 
it is a powerfully acted and directed story of family and romantic 
love of devotion to the land and dedication to higher principle 
it is also fun it has humor theres a renegade goose a 
mischievous young boy a noisy neighbor a lovestruck teenager in 
love with a gallant soldier an adolescent struggling for manhood 
a loving highly principled wife and a gentle but strong father 
its about the good and sometimes difficult things that happen 
between man and wife and parent and child the film also has sweep 
and majesty and power and pathos for you see it takes place 
against the backdrop of our american epic the civil war and 
because the family is of the quaker religion and renounces 
violence each of its characters must in his or her own way face 
this war and the moral dilemma it poses the film shows not just 
the tragedy of war but the problems of pacifism the nobility of 
patriotism as well as the love of peace i promise not to spoil 
its outcome for you but i hope youll permit me to describe one 
scene just as the invading armies come into southern indiana one 
of our states the quaker farmer is approached by two of his 
neighbors one is also a quaker who earlier in the story when 
times are peaceful denounces violence and vows never to lift his 
hand in anger but now that the enemy has burned his barn hes on 
his way to battle and criticizes his fellow quaker for not joining 
him in renouncing his religious beliefs the other visitor also on 
his way to battle is the intruding but friendly neighbor yet it 
is this neighbor although a nonbeliever who says hes proud of the 
quaker farmers decision not to fight in the face of the tragedy 
of war he is grateful as he says that somebodys holding out for 
a better way of settling things 
it seems to me mr general secretary that in pursing these 
summit meetings we too have been holding out for a better way of 
settling things and by the way the films title is more than a 
little appropriate its called friendly persuasion 
so mr general secretary allow me to raise a glass to the work 
that has been done the work that remains to be done and let us 
also toast the art of friendly persuasion the hope of peace with 
freedom the hope of holding out for a better way of settling 
things 
thank you and god bless you

the warravaged afghan countryside 
could not feed the countrys millions of civil war refugees if they 
were to return immediately a new study on the state of afghan 
agriculture says 
there was deliberate destruction of the agricultural system by 
the russians particularly along the highways professor azam 
gul an afghan citizen who directed the sixmonth study told a 
news conference monday 
if the refugees returned en masse now the land would not 
support them that is the categorical conclusion of the survey 
said tom morrison of the britainbased agrisystems which trained 
the researchers and collated the data 
gul said the devastation had occurred mainly since soviet troops 
intervened in 1979 to back the government in its war with 
anticommunist guerrillas villages were systematically bombed and 
trees destroyed around soviet bases he said 
the soviets are in the process of withdrawing their more than 
100000 soldiers from afghanistan under a unsponsored accord 
signed in april the pullout is to be completed in february 
the guerrillas who launched their insurgency after a communist 
coup in 1978 have said they will keep up the war until the 
government of president najib is defeated 
gul said agricultural production in 1986 fell to 45 percent of 
the level in 1978 the year before the soviet intervention good 
rains last spring brought production up to 53 percent of its 1978 
level he said 
the survey said it will take at least three years and 4 billion 
to restore cropland and livestock affected by 10 years of fighting 
in afghanistan other officials have said such reconstruction could 
take 10 to 20 years 
farmers told the researchers that the afghan army burned crops 
and shot cattle and sheep sometimes from helicopter gunships 
hundreds of farmers said more than five animals a year in their 
herds were blown up by land mines according to the report 
other farmers told researchers they sold livestock to pay for 
food or transportation out of the country 
the swedishfinanced survey was conducted by a team of afghan 
researchers who returned to their home areas to question 20000 
farmers the results are designed to help aid projects and resettle 
more than 5 million refugees after soviet troops leave afghanistan 
the 68page report says food production improved in 1986 after 
the ussupplied guerrillas received antiaircraft missiles 
providing a protective umbrella and allowing agricultural 
operations to continue during daytime 
gul said the survey was conducted only in guerrillaheld areas 
but included all 29 provinces at least two of the 68 researchers 
escaped an ambush by government troops and another was captured and 
imprisoned six who were sent to remote provinces still have not 
reported back gul said 
the researchers used questionnaires to collect details on war 
damage crop yields irrigation and use of fertilizers 
the results showed that among farmers who fled afghanistan in 
1987 42 percent reported their cattle sheep or goats had been 
shot to death or killed by mines and 65 percent of the farmers 
said their crops were burned 
the report recommended a phased return of the refugees timed to 
the distribution of food aid and the rebuilding of the afghan 
farms most of the refugees have fled to pakistan or iran 
reconstruction will be slow said morrison its not only a 
question of money its a matter of time just for oxen to 
reproduce you need three years to produce high quality seed he 
said 
political obstacles also will delay rehabilitation said anders 
fange of the swedish committee for afghanistan which paid for the 
870000 project 
no matter what kind of government there will be it will be 
very weak said fange who is based in the refugee camps at 
peshawar pakistan 
fragmentation of authority between the government and local 
guerrilla commanders will make the distribution of aid extremely 
complicated he said

after today therell be no more automatic 
warnings for businesses that hire illegal aliens instead they 
face stiff fines from a nolongerforgiving immigration and 
naturalization service 
from the loftiest fortune 500 company to the smallest corner 
grocery store companies tempted to look the other way when aliens 
apply could find themselves hit where it hurts the company 
coffers 
employers who violate the 1986 law barring the hiring of illegal 
immigrants now automatically get warning citations for the first 
offense but on june 1 ins has the discretion to issue a citation 
or a fine 
it is a system that has worked in europe and many feel it 
offers the best hope to curb illegal immigration and transfer jobs 
from aliens to us citizens 
but others worry about possible exploitation of illegal workers 
discrimination against foreignappearing workers the impact on the 
labor force and the dangers of turning employers into immigration 
police 
employers face fines of up to 1000 for improper documentation 
up to 2000 per alien for a first offense of knowingly hiring an 
illegal alien up to 5000 per alien for the second offense 
10000 for subsequent offenses and 3000 or six months in jail 
for a pattern or practice of violation 
over the past year ins fined 80 businesses 350000 and issued 
2000 citations the agency thus views the new phase not as a 
dramatic crackdown but as a nudge to employers 
our intent is not to indiscriminately run around fining 
employers the intent is to encourage employers to validate their 
work force says ins spokesman duke austin itll be a 
deliberate implementation of the law 
austin says the agency will use its resources judiciously 
targeting the construction garment and hotel and service 
industries that have traditionally been repositories of illegal 
workers 
in europe where many countries adopted employer sanctions a 
decade ago the system did not trigger widespread job 
discrimination against foreigners according to a 1987 study by the 
center for immigration studies a private think tank that 
researches immigration trends 
virginia lamp thomas labor attorney for the us chamber of 
commerce says businesses are afraid that the law has significant 
teeth in it 
the chamber is conducting a survey to determine how the law is 
working some experts have made preliminary assessments 
employer sanctions will probably work best in the larger firms 
and will work least effectively as you get down to the mom and pop 
enterprises that dont pay much anyhow and need the cheap illegal 
labor to survive says david simcox director of the center for 
immigration studies 
the amnesty phase of the 1986 law in which illegal aliens who 
came to the united states before 1982 could apply for temporary 
residency enlarged the pool of legal workers available for 
lowpaying jobs 
employers have got the windfall of having additional pools of 
lowwage workers which means they dont have to modernize or raise 
wages in order to make jobs more attractive says vernon m 
briggs jr a labor economist at cornell university 
the potential for worker exploitation concerns civil liberties 
advocates 
the law grandfathered in workers who had jobs on nov 6 
1986 the date it was passed that means that employers did not 
have to ask those workers for documents although illegal workers 
in that category remain subject to deportation if caught by ins 
now the worry is that those workers can be trapped in their jobs 
with no redress against an unscrupulous employer 
there is also the issue of job discrimination the law bars 
employers from refusing to hire someone because of their national 
origin or in the case of someone who has taken steps to become a 
citizen his citizenship status it sets up a special justice 
department counsel to prosecute complaints 
but the law also allows employers to hire us citizens over 
noncitizens if the two individuals are equally qualified 
thats going to make it even more difficult to prove 
discrimination equally qualified is to a certain degree 
subjective says mario moreno of the mexicanamerican legal 
defense and educational fund which provides legal assistance to 
mexicanamericans and others involved in employment discrimination 
suits or complaints 
the general accounting office an investigative branch of 
congress last fall found little evidence that employers were 
discriminating against foreignlooking job applicants because of 
the new law but those findings are only preliminary

the nations environmental statistics are a 
disgrace with billiondollar decisions turning on the readings of 
a handful of monitoring instruments says a veteran washington 
environmental analyst calling for a bureau of environmental 
statistics 
such a bureau could direct attention and spending to needed 
areas avoid costly unnecessary programs and keep bureaucrats 
honest writes paul portney vice president of resources for the 
future and director of the organizations center for risk 
management the group studies environmental policy but does not 
engage in lobbying 
we currently do a disgraceful job of collecting analyzing and 
disseminating information about environmental conditions and 
trends portney said in a paper written for his organization and 
distributed last week 
linda fisher assistant administrator for policy and planning at 
the environmental protection agency said portney had a good idea 
epa she said collects tons of statistics under its 
regulations but we are only beginning to think about how 
datagathering should be organized and who should do it 
environmental statistics are gathered by epa the us 
geological survey the forest service the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration the national aeronautics and space 
administration the occupational safety and health administration 
the food and drug administration and several other parts of the 
government 
government simply could not work without the bureau of labor 
statistics the bureau of economic analysis the census bureau the 
energy information administration and other respected professional 
statistics agencies portney said 
an annual report of the president pulls together 100 different 
economic data series dating back to 1929 for the environment no 
one puts it all together even though the council on environmental 
quality a white house agency severely downgraded by the reagan 
administration is charged by statute with collecting and 
publishing environmental statistics 
even in its halcyon days however the ceq was never able to 
muster the resources to present truly comprehensive and consistent 
environmental data on an annual basis portney said 
portney guessed that 200 million a year is spent on economic 
statistics very small in comparison to the 75 billion or more 
that we spend to comply with epa regulations alone 
he said he did not know what his proposed bureau should spend or 
where it should be placed but it should have statutory 
independence like the energy information administration in the 
energy department 
if the bureau of environmental statistics were a separate line 
in epas annual budget appropriations for data collection and 
analysis could not easily by siphoned off this now happens 
regularly when the program offices in whose budgets monitoring 
funds are now included are given additional regulatory 
responsibilities for which no funds are available portney wrote 
epa judges compliance with some clean air standards by peak 
onehour readings from the highestreading monitor in an area 
sanctions rare so far could cost an area hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
the temptation to shut monitors down at strategic times for 
maintenance or to relocate them to more convenient sites could be 
considerable portney wrote 
while there is no evidence to suggest that our national air 
quality data have been compromised in this way it is only now that 
the nonattainment sanctions have become a serious possibility a 
credible independent federal presence is badly needed to guard 
against this possibility 
several reports suggest that in checking compliance with 
55miles per hour speed limit states played similar games to avoid 
loss of highway aid locating radar guns on hills in congested 
areas and so forth so that reported speeds would be low and 
unrepresentative of actual speeds

a report from the international monetary fund 
acknowledges that poor people have been hurt by policies it has 
pressed on third world countries with the support of the united 
states 
in the past the imf has stressed that countries will be worse 
off if they delay the austerity policies such as devaluation of 
currencies and cuts in government spending usually required as a 
condition for imf loans 
the fund is owned by 151 governments with the united states 
holding the biggest block of votes at the end of march poor 
countries owed the fund 286 billion 
though founded in an effort to keep all currencies stable in 
recent years the fund has spent its money almost entirely on 
helping about 80 poor countries keep up with their debt much of it 
owed to the us government and banks 
although many of the major policy instruments improved the 
position of the dominant poverty groups in the sample countries 
other poverty groups were made worse off in the short run the 
new report says 
it chooses seven sample countries whose governments in recent 
years have adopted adjustment programs in order to get loans 
from the fund chile dominican republic ghana kenya 
philippines sri lanka and thailand 
the authors are five members of the fund staff led by an 
american peter s heller the fund distributed the report this 
week from its headquarters in washington 
the statement that introduces it comes from michel camdessus 
the funds french managing director 
adjustment does not have to lower basic human standards 
the more that adjustment efforts give proper weight to social 
realities especially the implications for the poorest the more 
successful they are likely to be 
large groups of poor people in the cities of chile the 
dominican republic and the philippines suffered from devaluations 
it says 
for the philippines the report tells how spending on health and 
schools was cut devaluation and restrictions on imports raised 
prices sharply while restrictions on the supply of money held down 
the number of jobs and the amount of wages 
in the dominican republic basic items were subsidized by a high 
exchange rate for the peso when the rate was lowered there was 
what the report calls major social unrest 
more than 50 people died in the dominican rioting of 1984 
sharp cuts in government spending may have hurt the poor in the 
long run as well as the short run in sri lanka and kenya according 
to the report but it adds that the cuts might have been even 
greater if there had been no agreement between the governments and 
the fund 
a rise in the tax on beer hit the people of ghana and kenya 
though not perhaps in welfare terms the report adds 
on the positive side the report says fund programs brought more 
credit for poor farmers in the dominican republic and sri lanka and 
the removal of price controls helped cut rents in the philippines 
and ghana 
it also says that lowering the exchange rate helped increased 
the real earnings of poor people in the country who were raising 
crops for export in ghana and to a lesser extent in kenya and the 
philippines

a leading reformer says he expects mikhail s 
gorbachevs liberalization drive to prevail at next months crucial 
party conference despite conservatives success at blocking some of 
its backers from attending 
the soviet leaders policies and programs are sufficiently 
strong to carry the conference prominent political scientist 
fyodor m burlatsky said monday he is among those who have been 
excluded 
the communist party conference the first since 1941 will lay 
out a a slate of policy decisions and proposals forming a blueprint 
for legislative changes it will amount to passing judgment on 
gorbachevs wideranging program of social and economic reforms 
known as perestroika 
the selection of the 5000 delegates to the june 28 conference 
has already turned into a showdown between backers of reform and 
those who seek to limit change often to preserve their privileges 
burlatsky said the conference will not name any new people to 
the 300member policymaking central committee in part to protect 
the committee headed by gorbachev from changes viewed as harmful 
if elections to the party conference have become so difficult 
how do we know elections to the central committee wont be tied up 
by some of these negative factors he asked 
burlatsky fell with the fortunes of nikita s khrushchev the 
late former premier but resurfaced to back gorbachevs 
perestroika campaign 
he said the partys charter does not spell out procedures for 
selecting delegates to party conferences we are learning 
democracy finding a style as we go it is certainly experimental 
since the last party conference was in 1941 times have changed 
radically and old ways of choosing delegates are no longer 
relevant the political scientist said 
instances where gorbachevs backers failed to get elected as 
delegates were sometimes the result of individual party officials 
striking the backers names from lists forwarded by factories 
institutes and local party organizations burlatsky said 
there were cases where regional secretaries themselves for 
formalistic reasons withdrew certain names he said using a 
term that suggests conservatism 
burlatsky historian yuri afanasyev and tatyana zaslavskaya a 
prominent sociologist are among those turned down by regional party 
authorities after being selected by their local groups as 
candidates to attend the conference 
exclusion of such noted backers of reform prompted 
demonstrations in moscow and leningrad over the weekend and 
accusations that the selection process was rigged 
ms zaslavskaya criticized the delegate selection process at a 
news conference last week saying the choices had not in every case 
been beneficial for the fate of gorbachevs reforms 
burlatsky joked that his own absence would take its toll at the 
party conference but i dont think it is dangerous to 
perestroika 
among the proposals are suggestions for jury trials relaxation 
of restrictions on religion reform of the criminal justice system 
limits on the political terms of party officials and some formal 
sanctioning of the informal groups springing up in the soviet 
union which burlatsky said now number about 30000 the groups 
which are unofficial but sometimes tolerated have come together to 
press causes like environmental protection and individual freedoms

when arlene crane mingles with some of the 
seedier characters in the nations capital its all in a days 
work 
as the wife of rep philip crane rill she does what is 
expected of a congressional spouse showing up at parties and 
receptions posing for pictures and answering reporters questions 
but the mother of eight has another life in what seems like 
another world 
arlene crane is a private detective 
so much for stereotypes she said laughing about the 
contrast of life in the public eye and work as a private eye i 
guess i must be a maverick 
but if my life had to revolve strictly around phil waiting 
for him to come home every night i think id go crazy she 
added you have to have diversion and i get plenty of it 
since graduating from a detective school in suburban washington 
seven years ago mrs crane said she has handled at least 50 cases 
ranging from the search for a missing person to gathering evidence 
for a divorce case 
it can be dirty its often seedy but its always 
challenging she said recently its also amazing who you have 
to consort with 
i could recall a few unsavory characters along the way but 
you have to do it if you dont ingratiate yourself to some of 
these lowlives there are times you just wont get the answers you 
need 
she said another part of the job surveillance dispels any 
impression that detective work is glamorous 
in one case the husband knew his wife was having an affair 
and he was certainly right we got the goods she said but it 
was 23 hours straight sitting in a car not getting out not 
even to go to the bathroom 
ill never forget it as long as i live in fact i dont think 
ill ever wear those clothes again 
mrs crane began as a fulltime detective with an agency when 
she received her diploma she now works part time as a freelance 
investigator often for lawyers because she wanted more freedom 
she was reluctant to talk about most of her recent 
investigations largely background checks but said her clients 
never include members of congress 
does she carry a gun 
i could but i dont i cant even think of a time when i 
needed to she said ironically you cant carry one in dc 
period unless you get a special dispensation and even then it 
has to be seen so id look a little silly going to a reception 
with a holster on my belt 
crane said he is proud of his wifes atypical occupation but 
also finds humor in the situation 
i bet im the only guy on the hill who wouldnt get mad if his 
wife was caught standing outside some strangers hotel room he 
said recently

for jim donoho and nancy collinsdonoho 
who had known each other 14 years when they wed on the 14th floor 
of the state capitol at 414 pm on feb 14 a reception could 
only be held once in a blue moon 
the two lincoln residents tied the knot in february but 
celebrated with a reception sunday night as the celestial 
composition neared its unique blue moon status 
its a rarity that coincides with the fact that our 
relationship seems to be rare in this day and age when people dont 
have longlasting relationships collinsdonoho said 
the second full moon in the same month known in folklore as a 
blue moon occurred at 653 am edt today according to the 
us naval observatory in washington the last full moon was may 1 
the term blue moon is applied because of the rarity of the 
situation which occurs once every two or three years but the moon 
does not ecessarily appear blue 
donoho 36 and collinsdonoho 31 met years ago while working 
at different businesses in lincoln

train commuters have felt the future of 
railroading and its making them uncomfortable and a little 
motion sick 
nj transit corp has introduced new seats on about 200 trains 
that some commuters hate about as much as their commute 
they say the seats which do not adjust like the old ones force 
them to ride facing the back sometimes do not offer enough head 
support and have wimpy armrests or none at all the seats dont 
even have hand grips on the sides for people who would rather stand 
some suspect a plot against the passengers is afoot 
they made the seat purposely lower on the aisle so the 
commuter will shove in and use the more comfortable middle seat i 
guess they figure nobody wants the middle seat said commuter 
albert papp 
he also complained when the seats force the passenger to ride 
backward the forces are reversed he said a lot of people 
apparently dont care for that it can even make them motion sick 
the commuters plan to voice their complaints wednesday at a 
meeting of the statewide transportation agency 
the seats recently were installed and nj transit officials say 
they arent inclined to spend the money to replace them but they 
scheduled the meeting to discuss what kind of seats to place in 300 
other cars that will be bought or refurbished in the next three 
years 
the commuter dissatisfaction surfaced in an nj transitsponsored 
survey of 2800 riders

attorney general edwin meese iii says he may 
resign before the november election but not before he has a chance 
to set the record straight 
meese said in an interview broadcast monday night that before he 
steps aside he wants to respond to the allegations that have been 
made against him concerning his ties to scandalplagued wedtech 
corp and a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project 
an independent counsel who has been investigating meese for the 
past year is expected to issue a report in several weeks meese is 
not expected to be indicted but the report will raise questions 
about his ethical conduct according to sources familiar with the 
probe 
those questions will be investigated by the justice departments 
office of professional responsibility in an examination that could 
continue for months 
once he has had an opportunity to respond to the independent 
counsels report and set the record straight meese said my 
own personal plans are going to be the deciding point as to when 
the proper time is to step down 
he said that time could be next jan 20 when president reagan 
leaves office or sometime before that 
meese was interviewed on cable news networks larry king 
live show when asked by former white house aide pat buchanan 
who was guest host on the show whether he might resign before 
labor day meese replied i dont think id rule anything in or 
anything out 
meese refused to discuss any details of his newly disclosed 
meeting with vice president george bush earlier this month 
but he said if i were to quit now for example it would be a 
real liability to bush because people would say there was 
something wrong 
meese told bush he would do nothing to hurt the vice presidents 
campaign for president bush said monday under questioning by 
reporters at his summer home in kennebunkport maine 
meese blamed the news media for polling results showing the 
public views him unfavorably and promised a strong counterattack 
once the independent counsel issues his report 
in the wake of a onesided barrage from the mediaim 
surprised actually it wasnt worse than that meese said of the 
poll results 
an abcwashington post poll last week showed a majority of the 
public thinks meese is not doing a good job as attorney general 
meese predicted adverse public opinion would change when im 
unleashed following the issuance of independent counsel james 
mckays report 
the attorney general also said it wasnt a crippling blow 
when two of his top aides resigned march 29 in protest of his 
continued tenure at the justice department 
deputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal division chief 
william weld quit out of concern that meese was hurting the justice 
departments operations morale and public image

the degradation and death of a teenage 
homosexual prostitute will be the focus in the murder trial of a 
former university professor who is accused of chopping up his 
victim with a chain saw 
tracy leroy nute a homeless 18yearold from kansas city mo 
died on aug 20 he was shot to death in a west hollywood apartment 
six months after leaving home saying he was going to california to 
be a movie star 
after his death police say someone took a chain saw to nutes 
body and hacked it into several pieces later scattering the parts 
around california 
the prosecution in the trial scheduled to begin today seeks to 
prove that the gun that killed nute and the chain saw with which he 
was dismembered were wielded by max bernard franc 
franc 58 a former political science professor at fresno state 
university denies being the killer and blames a man named terry 
adams 
but the prosecutor deputy district attorney sterling norris 
says a lengthy investigation of men named terry adams only 
convinced him that franc invented the person 
franc who has no criminal record was arrested aug 29 after he 
returned a chain saw to a rental company with bits of flesh and 
blood in its inner workings 
franc who lived in fresno also maintained an apartment in west 
hollywood 
pieces of nutes body were found near freeways in fresno and 
valencia 200 miles apart 
superior court judge john h reid has ruled that jurors in the 
trial can be shown some photos of the severed body parts but he 
said other pictures are too gory to show jurors who might be so 
inflamed by them they would convict the defendant without weighing 
other evidence 
norris scheduled to deliver his opening statement today said 
he will try to prove through analysis of decomposition time that 
franc refrigerated portions of the body before discarding them 
he contends franc killed nute in a homosexual rage and 
dismembered the body to avoid detection 
according to counselors in the homosexual community nute 
quickly abandoned his dreams of stardom and wound up working the 
streets of west hollywood as a homosexual prostitute he dyed his 
dark hair blond and wore it in spikes 
franc a native of depere wis has acknowledged knowing nute 
and said he once loaned him money but he denies killing the youth 
franc resigned his teaching post after his arrest

burials were postponed today after union 
workers struck 17 san francisco bay area cemeteries in a dispute 
over nonunion subcontractors and health benefits 
during this strike there wont be any interment mortuaries 
will have to hold the bodies said bruce green weekend manager 
of woodlawn memorial park in colma the strikers however did not 
interfere with memorial day visitors 
in 1985 more than 800 bodies went unburied until a long strike 
was settled 
the main issue in the strike which began monday and is the 
areas fifth cemetery walkout since 1971 was the use of nonunion 
subcontractors said carolyn del gaudio business agent for the 
cemetery workers and greens attendants union local 265 
that involves a real threat to the future of their jobs 
to the union itself said del gaudio whose union represents 150 
workers who are groundskeepers custodians and handle burials and 
cremations 
but john cantwell who represents two associations of cemetery 
owners called subcontracting a sham issue cemeteries always 
have used subcontractors and the owners associations proposal 
says no workers will be laid off because of subcontracting he said 
the unions threeyear contract with associated cemeteries and 
the east bay interment properties association expired march 1 it 
covered employees at eight cemeteries east of san francisco and 
nine south on the peninsula the only cemetery in san francisco at 
the army presidio was unaffected by the strike 
contract negotiations broke off saturday and no new talks are 
scheduled cantwell said 
at least one cemetery in hayward canceled burials scheduled 
for today 
the burials will simply have to be postponed cantwell said 
cemetery workers receive 1435 an hour after 18 months 
cantwell said under the employers proposal employees would 
receive raises of 30 cents an hour for each year of the contract 
he said 
employers also are offering to pay the same amount for employee 
health insurance as under the previous contract cantwell said

the bahamas has become more cooperative with the 
united states in an antidrug effort while chances are diminishing 
that the islands prime minister will face a drug indictment in 
this country a newspaper reports 
the bahamian government has joined the united states in combined 
drug raids and allowed a us customs base on gun cay south of 
bimini the miami herald reported monday 
were at a very high level of cooperation at this point 
said customs spokesman michael sheehan in miami 
sheehans statement was echoed by jack hook spokesman for the 
drug enforcement administration 
but chances that the prime minster sir lynden o pindling 
could be prosecuted on drugrelated charges appear remote because 
of obstacles in an ongoing probe of an overseas drugsmuggling 
network 
first the shaky status of federal drug indictments in miami and 
tampa against panama gen manuel antonio noriega has raised doubts 
about whether the united states would want to indict a foreign head 
of state the reagan administration reportedly has offered to drop 
the indictments in a deal in which noriega would step down from 
power 
i find very little incentive indicting foreign potentates if 
the state department can negotiate them right out from under my 
feet said us attorney robert merkle who has indicated hell 
quit if the indictment against noriega is dropped 
merkle of tampa has refused to comment on the reported probe 
of pindling 
the herald said a grand jury in orlando is hearing testimony 
against pindling the bahamian leader since 1967 who was reelected 
last year after his government was rocked by a drugcorruption 
scandal 
the herald citing a wellplaced source said a july 4 
deadline has been set for an indictment of pindling 
another major obstacle the herald said is the statute of 
limitations pindlings probe stemmed from testimony given by 
prosecution witnesses in the jacksonville federal trial of 
convicted colombian drug kingpin carlos lehder rivas 
most of the allegations raised against pindling in the lehder 
trial involved incidents in the late 1970s and 1980 which would 
put them past the fiveyear statute of limitations 
merkle prosecuted lehder who was accused of using the private 
bahamian island of normans cay as a cocaine transshipment point 
and was convicted on all drug counts he faced 
during lehders trial merkle called pindling a 
coconspirator prosecution witness george baron said bahamian 
police were guarding the prime minister when he delivered a 
suitcase with 400000 to pindling in 1980 for alleged protection 
of barons marijuanasmuggling through the bahamas 
pindling in a may 4 statement denied barons story and charges 
of corruption and bribetaking the bahamian government ran 
fullpage ads may 10 in us newspapers stressing its commitment to 
fighting drugs and protesting what they called old allegations 
a 1984 royal commission of inquiry detailed corruption in lower 
levels of the bahamian government and law enforcement but stopped 
short of linking pindling to the drug corruption

a duel took susan wheeler decaturs heroic 
husband from her 168 years ago and fate kept their remains apart 
until now 
mrs decaturs resting place was dedicated monday in a church 
yard next to her husbands grave three students from an elementary 
school named for stephen decatur participated in a wreathlaying 
ceremony attended by about 100 people 
decatur was one of the young american navys heroes lionized 
for his feats of daring against north african pirates and for a 
victory over a british warship during the war of 1812 
after he was killed by a duelists bullet on march 22 1820 
mrs decatur lived 40 years without him she then lay buried for 
128 years in washington dc while he rested beside his parents 
at st peters episcopal church here 
through the efforts of georgetown university the remains of 
mrs decatur were removed from a universityowned cemetery placed 
in a mahogany coffin and on may 19 reburied beside her husband who 
had been buried under a 30foottall granite column 
mondays ceremony coincided with the opening of a small decatur 
exhibit at the philadelphia maritime museum decatur was a native 
of philadelphia the son of a revolutionary war naval officer who 
was reared among the ships and shipbuilders of the citys late 
18thcentury waterfront 
his most intrepid act was his feb 7 1804 burning of the 
captured american frigate philadelphia in the harbor of tripoli in 
modernday libya 
then 25 and disguised as a maltese sailor decatur headed a 
raiding party that sailed into the heavily guarded harbor they 
boarded set fires and destroyed the frigate which had been seized 
six months earlier by tripoli warships 
two years later decatur married susan wheeler the daughter of 
the mayor of norfolk va and a noted belle of that town and 
baltimore she was said to be well educated charming and pretty 
but little else is known about her 
they were childless and had been married for 14 years when 
decatur died in the duel at age 41 
decatur was challenged by capt james barron whom decatur had 
criticized after a ship barron commanded was severely damaged by a 
british warship in 1807 
the men stood about 8 yards apart in bladensburg md outside 
washington and fired a pair of ornate longbarreled silver 
pistols barron was wounded in the hip but recovered 
decatur also was shot in the hip but the bullet traveled into 
his abdomen and he died in his home that evening 
mrs decatur eventually settled near the campus of what is now 
georgetown university and in 1837 gave the struggling catholic 
college 7000 
she died july 21 1860 and was buried in a college graveyard 
that was forgotten until the ground was prepared for a new building 
in 1954 according to charles f meng georgetowns vice president 
for administration her remains were moved to another college 
cemetery where they stayed until she was reburied alonside her 
husband 
all of the family and there are quite a number of us feel 
very good about this said maria decatur garnett 67 of kittery 
point maine a greatgreatgreatniece of decatur it was a 
romantic marriage they were extremely romantic and very handsome

tons of old chemicals that have turned toxic and 
potentially explosive were being removed from two buildings at 
hunter college where they were like a time bomb in science 
laboratories officials said 
the discovery of the chemicals some up to 30 years old forced 
the college to close thomas hunter hall and the north building on 
may 20 city department of environmental protection and school 
officials said monday 
among the chemicals found were 25 canisters of explosive and 
highly reactive chemicals including ether and picric acid and 90 
canisters of gases some of which may be poisonous said department 
spokeswoman joan paylo 
picric acid when it crystallizes can be as explosive as 
dynamite in small quantities it is feared throughout labs when it 
is old ms paylo said calling the chemicals a time bomb 
college officials learned about the chemicals presence when the 
fire department discovered ether during an inspection may 11 
college spokesman robin elliott said 
subsequent investigations revealed tons of expired chemicals in 
the buildings science laboratories and storage rooms ms paylo 
said 
so far the spokeswoman said 135 to 140 rooms have been 
searched for dangerous chemicals a hazardous waste removal 
contractor planned to search all 500 rooms in both buildings today 
she said 
the police bomb squad and individual contractors have removed 
some of the dangerous substances elliott and ms paylo said 
some of the gas is still on the premises because it is 
difficult to find a contractor who will take it she said 
the colleges policy had been to leave the regulation of 
materials to individual researchers in the labs elliott said 
the discovery of the chemicals shows that you cant leave this 
important safetyrelated area to individual people 
classes at the college ended for the summer two weeks ago

an 80yearold roman catholic bishop jailed since 
1982 for ordaining priests outside of the official 
communistcontrolled church has been released an official said 
today 
bishop fan xueyan also known as joseph fan was released two or 
three months ago from the shijiazhuang jail in hebei province just 
south of beijing a hebei justice department official said in 
response to a question 
the official gave his name only as li he said he did not know 
why fan was released his present whereabouts or the state of his 
health 
the vatican ordained fan bishop of baoding in hebei province in 
1951 shortly before chinas new communist government ordered the 
chinese catholic church to break with the vatican in the name of 
antiimperialism 
the officially sanctioned catholic patriotic association that 
was then formed rejects the authority of the pope and ordains its 
own bishops hundreds of catholic clerics and laypeople who refused 
to support the association were arrested in the 1950s and many have 
been released only in the past 10 years 
fan among them was arrested in 1958 and spent 15 years in jail 
he was arrested again in 1982 and sentenced to 10 years in jail 
for allegedly maintaining ties with the vatican and ordaining 
priests 
the government which under senior leader deng xiaoping has 
alternated between relaxation and severity in its policy toward 
religious dissidents has shown leniency this year to several 
elderly catholic clerics 
chinas most famous catholic dissident shanghai bishop gong 
pingmei also known as ignatius kung was allowed to fly to the 
united states this month for medical treatment he had been jailed 
from 195585 and parole restrictions were lifted only this year 
the rev zhu hongshen also known as vincent chu was paroled 
from jail in february so he could receive medical care zhu who is 
believed to be about 72 had been imprisoned from 1955 to 1979 and 
was arrested again in 1981 for alleged subversive activities 
chinas official catholic church claims more than 3 million 
members an unknown number of catholics remain loyal to the vatican 
and worship is illegal house churches

a wells fargo guard walked into fbi 
offices with his attorney and 50000 of 25 million stolen from 
an armored car surrendered and then told agents where to find the 
rest of the booty the fbi said 
jared layne gray 26 appeared just before 1 am monday to 
confess to the may 5 robbery he was booked and held without bail 
in the salt lake county jail pending arraignment today before a 
federal magistrate 
we were somewhat surprised said fbi special agent bob lund 
wed been working on this and on something like this you 
generally expect to go out and make an arrest 
gray told authorities where the rest of the stolen cash was 
hidden and agents recovered all of the money late monday lund 
said he declined to say where it was found except that it was in 
another state 
lund also would not elaborate on grays whereabouts for the past 
25 days or say whether authorities believed there was an accomplice 
he had been inside utah and hed been in some of the 
surrounding states lund said 
gray one of three wells fargo guards transporting the money 
from boise idaho to the federal reserve bank in salt lake city 
had been sought since he disappeared the night the 252 million in 
100 bills was taken from the truck 
authorities say the armored car pulled in to a convenience store 
near corinne and the two other guards were locked inside by a 
wedge of wood used to jam the door 
gray is charged with three federal felony counts theft by an 
agent of the federal reserve bank theft of bank funds and theft 
from an interstate shipment 
lund said he did not know why the guard turned himself in but 
suggested that a nagging conscience probably was a factor 
no 1 he doesnt have a criminal history no 2 i think he 
probably planned this thing out and said yeah i can live without 
my family for a while i can go to south america live 
luxuriously for a long long time he said 
then he just got to missing these people i think he might 
have had some conscience pangs lund said

soviet troops evacuated towns south of 
kabul today in their second major retreat from afghan outposts 
leaving government forces to ward off rebel attacks in the 
strategic area western and soviet diplomatic sources said 
soviet troops left ghazni 85 miles southwest of kabul and were 
heading north toward the soviet border said the sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
a soviet convoy from ghazni reached the outskirts of kabul about 
sunrise today and passed around the edge of the capital the 
western source said it was not known how many troops were involved 
the western source said the soviets today were also pulling out 
of gardez 60 miles south of kabul 
the evacuation of soviet troops from the area leaves the afghan 
army largely unassisted at least on the ground against attacks by 
antigovernment guerrillas in the provinces separating kabul from 
the pakistani border to the south and southeast 
the guerrillas who have been fighting both afghan and soviet 
troops have headquarters in pakistan which serves as their 
conduit for arms supplies by pakistan the united states and china 
the soviet withdrawal started may 15 with departure of troops 
from jalalabad 75 miles east of kabul 
under an april agreement signed in geneva the soviets are to 
complete withdrawal by feb 15 1989 when the pullout began the 
soviets had an estimated 115000 soldiers in afghanistan about 
10000 have left so far according to reports from moscow 
the soviet military intervention in afghanistan started in dec 
1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a sovietstyle 
government in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks 
meanwhile the guerrillas claimed from their headquarters in 
pakistan that they had captured the strategic panjsheer valley 
northeast of kabul last thursday 
the claim could not be verified in kabul afghan and soviet 
officials declined to comment 
the guerrillas claimed afghan and soviet troops had left the 
valley and said they controlled the towns of rokhah and anawa 
if true the guerrillas would hold major vantage points near the 
soviet evacuation route north of kabul leading to the salang tunnel 
the guerrillas said the salang highway was still open to 
withdrawing soviet convoys giving credence to a report from 
western diplomatic sources last week that rebels operating in the 
area were letting the red army through provided that the soviets go 
peacefully 
a western source in kabul said he did not know if the claim was 
true but he said the guerrillas had captured bazarak 6 miles 
northeast of rokhah on may 23 rokha is 50 miles northeast of 
kabul

condition of anonymity said guerrillas were now operating within 6 
to 12 miles of kabul

the wounds from the civil war have not 
yet healed according to retired gen william c westmoreland who 
commanded us troops in vietnam and whose relatives fought for the 
confederate army 
westmoreland speaking monday in a memorial day ceremony at 
gettysburg national cemetery said the threeday battle of 
gettysburg and other confrontations in the civil war played a 
crucial role in the evolution of the united states 
a nation is never fully formed westmoreland told about 
1000 spectators in the cemetery where president abraham lincoln 
delivered his famed gettysburg address in 1863 
lincoln sought unity and equality westmoreland said he added 
that while the states remain united we have not made a 
completely equal opportunity available to all 
perhaps the most serious failure in our nationbuilding effort 
has been the fate of our lands original inhabitants the 
indians he said 
but he said many wounds have healed since union and 
confederate troops fought here in what many historians consider the 
decisive battle of the civil war 
america as we know it today is a vibrant national entity 
i believe lincoln would be pleased with the american nation of 
1988 westmoreland said standing near a monument marking the 
spot where lincoln dedicated the cemetery nearly five months after 
the fighting ended with confederate troops retreating from northern 
soil

the socialists made big gains the 
governmentleading christian democrats advanced slightly and the 
communists were the main losers in italys local elections 
official results showed today 
newspapers and politicians said the elections strengthened the 
national fiveparty coalition of christian democrat premier ciriaco 
de mita confirmed a political shift to the center and signalled 
continuing movement on the left from the communists toward the 
socialists 
according to final returns from municipal elections sunday and 
monday the christian democrats took 368 percent of the vote up 
from 356 percent in the last local voting in 1983 and 349 percent 
in last junes parliamentary elections 
the socialists made the biggest gains recording 183 percent 
compared to 153 percent in 1983 and 142 percent last summer 
the communists italys second largest party and the biggest 
communist party in the west got 219 percent a big drop from the 
258 percent of 1983 and 268 percent of last june 
seven million people about onefifth of italys electorate 
were eligible to vote sunday and monday in the elections for city 
councils in 1200 cities and towns and governments in three 
provinces 
the final turnout was put at 862 percent 
the vote was not expected to affect the balance of power on the 
national scene but it gave an indication of the political climate 
just over a month since de mita formed italys 48th postwar 
government a fiveparty coalition of christian democrats 
socialists social democrats republicans and liberals 
romes leftleaning la repubblica italys largest newspaper 
said in a frontpage editorial the real political result is the 
crossing of votes on the left between the communists and 
socialists the start of a rebalancing of the italian left 
the christian democrats who have dominated italys postwar 
politics noted that it was the first time since 1970 that they 
have increased their percentage over the previous local election 
another significant result was the poor showing of the farright 
neofascist italian social movemement which slipped to 39 percent 
from 5 percent in 1983 and 68 in the national election last summer 
la repubblica said the losses of the communists and the 
farright were evidence that like in all economically mature 
countries our electorate is moving to the center of the political 
sphere and abandoning the areas further away from the point of 
balance

four red cross officials have arrived in cuba to 
visit political prisoners and investigate prison conditions for the 
first time since fidel castro came to power 29 years ago an 
organization spokesman said today 
carlos bauverd spokesman for the genevabased international 
committee of the red cross said the team arrived in havana on 
monday and hoped to begin visiting prisoners today 
cuba is believed to be the third soviet ally to permit the red 
cross to visit prisoners poland and afghanistan have already done 
so 
the officials including one doctor hoped to visit every 
political prisoner in the communist country during their stay 
expected to last about one month bauverd told the associated press 
the delegation planned to visit all of cubas prisons bauverd 
said cuban authorities say there are 15 
bauverd said cuban officials had agreed to the standard red 
cross procedures of visiting prisoners without witnesses and 
reserving the right to repeat visits in the future 
he said the red cross would not have an exact number of 
political prisoners in cuba until after the visit 
however according to published reports the cuban government 
has said the red cross would be allowed to visit 323 prisoners 
described as counterrevolutionaries or statesecurity 
prisoners 
bauverd said the red cross team would give a confidential report 
to the cuban government after the visit and that its contents would 
not be made public under red cross policy 
in a related development the united nations announced today the 
composition of a team of delegates from its human rights commission 
who are to visit cuba later this year 
the sixmember team will be headed by the commission chairman 
alioune sene of senegal it includes delegates from bulgaria 
colombia ireland nigeria and the philippines un spokeswoman 
therese gastaut told a weekly briefing 
ms gastaut said a date for their visit had not been set sene 
said in march that the visit would probably take place in july or 
august 
the human rights commission decided at its annual meeting 
earlier this year to accept an invitation from castros government 
to send a delegation to cuba to investigate the human rights 
situation there and report back to next years commission which 
begins in february 
the decision followed allegations by the united states and some 
international organizations including amnesty international of 
human rights violations in cuba such as torture and mistreatment 
of political prisoners 
cuba which was an observer to the commission last year was 
elected last week to sit on the 1989 commission

the united states and the soviet union today 
signed an accord providing that each superpower will notify the 
other of the time place and intended target of 
intercontinentalrange missile tests 
but that agreement signed in the kremlin by secretary of state 
george p shultz and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze as 
president reagan and soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
looked on is only a slice of the unfinished strategic arms 
reduction treaty start 
that accord remains elusive although both reagan and gorbachev 
answering reporters questions at the outset of their day of summit 
talks voiced fresh optimism that it can be achieved 
the testing accord is what has come to be called a 
confidencebuilding measure last weekend senior reagan 
administration officials said it was snagged in a dispute with the 
soviets who wanted a broader agreement 
the differences were worked out by senior american and soviet 
negotiators under the direction of reagan and gorbachev along 
with another agreement providing for joint tests this summer in 
nevada and at semipalatinsk of us and soviet devices to measure 
the force of blasts 
asked why reagan and gorbachev did not sign the pacts gennady 
gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman quipped its 
too small for them its important but not that important 
the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the 
prenotification accord a practical new step designed to reduce 
the risk of misinterpretation miscalculation or accident 
the notice of a test launching must be given at least 24 hours 
in advance and will be made through riskreduction centers in 
washington and moscow 
a third accord extending for three years and expanding 
ussoviet cultural exchanges was signed by charles z wick the 
director of the us information agency and by soviet culture 
minister vasuky zamharov 
six other agreements were signed later at the foreign ministry 
one gives fishermen in the two countries access to each others 
waters another provides for cooperation between the us coast 
guard and the soviets in search and rescue operations a third 
extends cooperation in radio navigation techniques 
a fourth agreement extend a 1973 accord for peaceful uses of 
atmomic energy another sets up five working groups to explore 
cooperation in solar and other outer space programs a sixth calls 
for cooperation in transportation 
you see the harvest shevardnadze told reporters with a 
smile 
asked when the start treaty would be ready shultz said 
negotiating the terms was a hard job shevardnadze added 
generally speaking its in the fall that we collect the 
harvest 
shultz signed all six accords for the united states 
shevardnadze signed four for the soviet union the fisheries 
agreement was signed by nikolai i kotlyar the fisheries minister 
while boris l tolstykh chairman of the state committee for 
science and technology signed the transportation accord 
shultz and shevardnadze then resumed their negotiations 
negotiators working on arms control human rights bilateral and 
regional issues met this morning and were to report their progress 
later in the day to shultz and shevernadze officials said 
two senior us officials briefing reporters separately under 
rules which barred disclosure of their names scaled down an 
optimistic account by gerasimov of progress toward resolving other 
arms control disputes 
nor was there any sign from either side of a breakthrough on the 
us program to develop a defense in space against ballistic 
missiles even if other issues are resolved the soviets have 
refused to complete the start treaty until the star wars dispute is 
resolved 
the two sides could not convince each other gerasimov said 
the soviets and many american analysts contend the us program 
threatens the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty it limits 
defenses on the theory a potential aggressor would be inhibited if 
he faced the prospect of devastating retaliation 
the reagan administration argues the program is not in conflict 
with the treaty 
on start gerasimov said the united states cleared the way to 
removing one of five major obstacles to a treaty dropping a demand 
for a ban on mobile missiles 
but the senior white house official disagreed saying the us 
position at this point is a ban on mobiles missile we are still 
discussing it 
soviet officials said before the summit that they thought the 
united states was ready to agree to allow mobile missiles if they 
could be restricted to a specific area and monitored by spy 
satellites and possibly through onsite inspection 
gerasimov told reporters that mostly all the questions of 
verification have been agreed upon about the territory where 
these missiles are going to be stationed 
but the us official said we havent heard a verification 
scheme that could work 
evidently there was progress on counting cruise missiles aboard 
warplanes though gerasimov again was more upbeat than the us 
official 
one american official reported some progress but no breakthrough 
on the counting rules and said the united states would consider 
any scheme the soviets propose for verifying compliance on ceilings 
for mobile landbased intercontinental ballitic missiles 
the soviets have deployed two mobile missiles the ss24 and 
ss25 the united states is developing one of its own the 
midgetman 
gerasimov complained that the united states was balking at a 
soviet proposal to remove a third obstacle to the start accord 
verifying limits on the number of cruise missiles carried by ships 
and submarines 
the united states has rejected conducting an experiment the 
soviets say will demonstrate a technology to detect the presence of 
nuclear weapons aboard warships by detecting the emission of 
neutrons and gamma rays 
we think this is not a serious approach at all gerasimov 
said send us two warships and we will tell you which one of them 
carries these nuclear weapons without touching them

was packed with more than 200 pounds of tnt 
charred corpses wrapped in nylon bags were turned over to the 
victims relatives at the st georges greek orthodox hospital for 
burial police said 
the victims will be buried separately because they come from 
different villages and areas said a police spokesman who cannot 
be identified under standing regulations 
he said the lebanese forces the main christian militia had 
banned a mass funeral adding they dont want a large crowd 
gathered at one place it will be too tempting a target for another 
terrorist attack 
the bomb exploded about 500 yards from an office of christian 
president amin gemayels phalange party it shattered facades of 
eight apartment buildings badly damaged 20 others and wrecked at 
least 30 cars 
the bombing came four days after syrian troops moved into the 
slums of south beirut ending three weeks of bloody clashes between 
shiite moslem militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 
1000 wounded 
the lebanese forces blamed syria for the bombing 
karim pakradouni the militias second in command told a news 
conference the day before yesterday saturday we received the 
propaganda message today monday we received the bloody message 
he referred to a statement saturday by information minister 
mohammed salman of syria who said presidential elections in 
lebanon would only be possible this summer if the lebanese forces 
withdrew from east beirut 
syria deployed about 2400 troops in the slums of south beirut 
on friday and saturday to end street battles between the 
iranianbacked hezbollah and the syriansupported amal militias 
the police spokesman said about 40 percent of south beiruts 
estimated 250000 population who fled the fighting had returned to 
the devastated area since the syrians moved in to enforce a 
ceasefire

the election of a prosyrian president and to extend syrias 
control over the whole country

capitals southern slums and lebanons eastern and northern

fraternity members have been ordered to 
perform community service at a veterans hospital for flying a huge 
us flag in violation of a rule aimed at stopping another 
fraternity from displaying a confederate banner 
i dont want to cause any problems said barry king 
president of the tau kappa epsilon chapter we just want to fly 
the american flag 
the interfraternity council court at auburn university ordered 
tau kappa epsilon members to work at the veterans administration 
hospital in tuskegee after they flew the 18by12 foot flag during 
a party 
the incident violated a 3yearold school rule designed to block 
the kappa alpha fraternity from draping its house with a huge 
confederate battle flag under the rule fraternities are barred 
from flying flags larger than 5 feet by 7 feet 
school officials enacted the flag rule in 1985 amid protests by 
black students who claimed that the confederate banner hung on the 
front of the kappa alpha house symbolized racial oppression 
tau kappa epsilon is challenging the flag rule and a university 
committee on fraternities and sororities will likely consider 
revamping the guideline grant davis assistant dean of students 
said monday 
ken smith chairman of the fraternity court told the auburn 
plainsman the universitys student newspaper that none of us 
had a problem with them flying the flag at the april 28 party 
but he said some action had to be taken because the rule 
against oversized flags was violated 
it was an awkward situation because you dont want to fine a 
fraternity for flying the american flag he said

when a group of cub scouts set out to lay a 
wreath at the foot of george washingtons statue they didnt 
expect him to return their salute but at least he could have 
looked their way 
members of pack 469 headed out to the statue in a plaza at the 
brooklyn entrance of the williamsburg bridge where washington sits 
atop his horse and prepared to salute the nations first president 
they found themselves saluting the tail end of the horse 
it seems the horse and rider face the bridge and manhattan 
rather than brooklyn 
assistant cubmaster thomas youngfleisch of pack 469 
characterized the situation as embarrassing and said the 800 
members of brooklyns dawn star district of the boy scouts of 
america will attempt to get the president and his steed turned 
around 
next year marks the 200th anniversary of washington taking the 
presidential oath in manhattan and district commissioner reggie 
regula said the founding father should be allowed to take a good 
look at brooklyn for the occasion 
regula said the scouts would keep the area surrounding the 
35foot statue clean if the city turned it around city officials 
are contemplating the offer

delegates at a national communist 
party conference today demanded a general overhaul of the party 
and replacement of those leaders who have led the country into its 
worst economic and social crisis in postwar history 
the party needs a general overhaul and that process has to 
start with the presidium politburo of the central committee 
boro avramovic a delegate from the largest republic of serbia 
said during the third day of the conference 
other delegates blamed their leaders for failing to implement 
changes to ease the nations crisis 
it is unlikely that those people who have led us into this 
crisis will be able to bring us out of it said rade milicevic 
another serbian delegate 
yugoslavia has been wrestling with a 21 billion foreign debt 
and unsuccessful attempts to lower its 170 percent inflation and 15 
percent unemployment 
the government saturday announced austerity measures including 
an almost 24 percent devaluation of the national currency and 
lifting of price controls to combat the economic crisis but 
growing labor unrest in protest of the new program is threatening 
the current communist government 
luka miletic a delegate from zagreb said the yugoslav people 
increasingly insist that the entire communist leadership should 
be replaced for failing to implement the necessary reforms 
several delegates today called for a special party congress to 
be held by the end of this year in order to replace the current 
leadership 
we dont need a special congress zvonimir hrabar head of 
the staterun trade unions said today what we need is action 
he added 
party conferences are largely advisory in nature and are 
intended to help the ruling party deal with problems arising 
between two party congresses party congresses held every four 
years in yugoslavia have broad powers to make changes in personnel 
and party organization 
vilma mancek from yugoslavias economically most advanced 
republic of slovenia opposed calls for a special congress saying 
it would be a waste of time and money 
those who demand a special congress should have the courage to 
propose the replacement of the party presidium she said since 
the central committee has the power to recall members of the 
presidium without holding a special congress 
young people are reluctant to join the communist party because 
they have no confidence in our organization said metka tekavcic 
a slovenian delegate 
party members account for less than 10 percent of the countrys 
population of 23 million and their number is rapidly dropping 
the official communist publication komunist said recently that 
50 percent of yugoslavias young generation shows repulsion toward 
party membership compared with 10 percent seven years ago 
komunist attributed this to the general disillusionment with the 
party after nearly 10 years of economic decline

defense minister yitzhak rabin today said he 
opened a dialogue with palestinians including supporters of the 
plo because the arabs should now realize their uprising in the 
occupied lands has failed 
i have met with those thought to be tending more to the plo 
to jordan i intend to continue meeting with people who represent 
different layers and points of view he told israel radio 
rabin met monday with four local palestinian leaders the second 
such session in less than a week 
it is only natural that at this stage of i hope the start of 
a thought that by stones and firebombs they can achieve nothing 
theres a place to start a dialogue rabin said today 
the palestinian leaders presented rabin with a list of requests 
to ease restrictions and what they termed collective punishment 
measures in the occupied west bank and gaza strip arab 
participants said 
rabin said he told the palestinians that the more we move 
towards quiet the lighter would be the means used and we 
have no intention to take revenge when what they call the intifada 
arab for uprising is over 
but palestinian participants said rabin could not predict any 
significant political movement 
the minister said the us secretary of state george shultz 
initiative has missed the train and we cant expect anything from 
the ussoviet moscow summit said yasser obeid head of the west 
bank health services 
he also quoted rabin as saying until the elections in israel 
and the united states and maybe six months after we cannot 
expect an active political process to start 
an israeli soldier meanwhile was indicted monday on a charge 
of manslaughter in the killing of an arab in the gaza strip the 
army command said the maariv newspaper said the soldier shot the 
arab from a distance of about two feet while talking to him 
the occupied territories were mostly quiet after mondays less 
than successful strike it faltered when thousands of palestinians 
ignored orders by underground leaders to stay away from their jobs 
in israel 
since violent protests began in the occupied lands on dec 8 
198 palestinians and two israelis have been killed 
the israeliowned news agency itim quoted prime minister yitzhak 
shamir as saying monday that the end of the uprising is in sight 
the dying down of the violence is clear and certain shamir 
told the agency 
shamirs chief rival foreign minister shimon peres also said 
in remarks broadcast on israel radio that palestinians were 
starting to question the value of the uprising he said they were 
asking where does all this lead to what are all these strikes 
stones and bottles 
hanna nasser a bethlehem businessman who participated in 
mondays meeting with rabin said it was a good thing to meet 
with him and exchange ideas 
other participants in the meeting included othman hallak editor 
of the an nahar newspaper in east jerusalem and yasser obeid head 
of the health services in the west bank nasser said the meeting 
was requested by rabin 
we talked briefly about the situation the uprising nasser 
said it was a discussion of domestic affairs nothing 
political 
the palestinians according to nasser asked rabin to free all 
the arab detainees especially students supposed to attend classes 
to stop demanding tax payment certificates for official 
transactions and to ease restrictions limiting the sums the arabs 
are allowed to bring into the country 
rabin promised to examine that question individually and to 
check closely the cases of arrests nasser said i dont know 
if these promises are going to be fulfilled he said it depends on 
how far the uprising will go 
the army meanwhile said that pvt yakov tamir confessed and 
was indicted on monday in the killing an arab on jan 10 in gaza 
city the military court verdict was expected sunday it said 
maariv wrote that tamir started to talk to a palestinian after a 
car he was travelling in was stoned passengers in the vehicle the 
newspaper said began to incite tamir and he shot the arab in the 
stomach the army declined comment

a small west german plane crossed the 
norwegian border into soviet air space a year after the dramatic 
flight by mathias rust to moscows red square a foreign ministry 
spokesman said today 
spokesman lasse seim said the cessna 150 was on its way from 
ivalo in northern finland to kirkenes in the northeast corner of 
norway on saturday when the pilot strayed over soviet territory 
the plane crossed deeper into soviet air space when it returned 
to ivalo on sunday seim said he said the aircraft penetrated 
several miles over soviet territory and may have violated 
soviet airspace for 20 or 30 minutes 
norwegian government sources and the west german embassy 
identified the pilot as andreas sommer of hamburg no further 
information on him was immediately available 
in helsinki matti autio spokesman for the finnish border 
patrol said sommer was questioned and released and left finland 
today apparently for sweden 
another border patrol official reached by telephone at the 
northern base of rovaniemi said sommer claimed he lost his way due 
to bad weather the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed it was cloudy in the area during the weekend 
a soviet embassy spokesman was quoted on swedish radio as 
calling the incident a stupid practical joke rather than a 
provocation 
no one wants to blow up this case seim said 
seim said norway contacted soviet authorities on sunday and 
we have the impression that they followed the plane they knew 
about it 
the aftenposten newspaper speculated that the soviet may have 
refrained from shooting at the plane because of the superpower 
summit in moscow 
seim said the soviet border commission asked for a meeting with 
the norwegians on monday when they handed over a formal protest 
asked if saturdays flight was timed to the anniversary of 
rusts flight seim said we dont know but it seems likely 
doesnt it 
rust also of hamburg flew a similar cessna to moscow from 
helsinki finland on may 28 1987 landing outside the kremlins 
walls he is serving a fiveyear prison term in the soviet union 
rust was 19 at the time he made the flight on sept 4 1987 he 
was found guilty by a moscow court of illegal entry into the soviet 
union violating international flight regulations and malicious 
hooliganism he was sentenced to four years in a labor camp but is 
currently being held in a moscow prison 
rusts flight embarrassed the soviet air defenses which failed 
to stop him and prompted a shakeup in the soviet military

in late march the survey showed that 55 percent favored bush 
34 percent liked dukakis and 11 percent were undecided 
bardsley said the main difference between the two polls is the 
switch of independent voters to dukakis independents favored bush 
by a 5to4 margin in march but the latest poll shows independents

preferably sen sam nunn of georgia or sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee 
i gave him some good advice and i hope he takes it bevill 
said 
all seven democratic members of alabamas congressional 
delegation expressed similar sentiments when asked how dukakis who 
is closing in on the democratic nomination can capture southern 
electoral votes 
i would hope he would seriously consider sam nunn said sen 
richard shelby dala shelby a member of the senate armed 
services committee said nunns experience on defense issues would 
neutralize dukakis perceived weaknesses in the area 
thats an area in which dukakis is lacking experience 
knowledge and maybe a vision shelby said it would be a vacuum 
that the senior senator from georgia could fill

a general strike today shut down a city at the 
center of a territorial and ethnic dispute between armenians and 
azeris in the southern soviet union sources said 
a moscow dissident sergei grigoryants said the strike has been 
under way for a week in stepanakert in the disputed region of 
nagornokarabakh 
the strike closed factories and mass transit in the city today 
with thousands of armenians staying away from work said a resident 
in a telephone interview with the associated press the resident 
declined to give his name 
also today the official soviet news agency tass announced two 
officials in the region were dismissed from the communist party for 
organizational and political mistakes that led to violence between 
armenians and azeris 
word of the strike in stepanakert came after a new demonstration 
was held monday in yerevan the capital of armenia said 
grigoryants 
in the yerevan protest 300000 armenians took to the streets to 
demand that nagornokarabakh in the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan be put under armenian jurisdiction grigoryants said 
the majority of nagornokarabakhs residents are armenian 
grigoryants a halfrussian halfarmenian journalist said the 
protest in yerevan occurred outside the opera theater on a square 
where huge demonstrations took place earlier this year

nagornokarabakh at the end of that month ethnic rioting broke 
out in the azeri city of sumgait in which 32 people six azeris 
and 26 armenians were killed 
communist authorities rejected the demand to change jurisdiction 
over nagornokarabakh instead chosing a program of social and 
economic development the ruling politburo also replaced this month 
its party leaders in both republics 
new party shakeups were announced today tass said the former 
first secretary of the nagornokarabakh regional party committee 
boris kevorkov was dismissed from the party because of his 
serious political mistakes 
his errors resulted in the loss of the party organizations 
vanguard role and in the heightening of interethnic relations 
tass said in announcing the action taken by a plenary meeting of 
the azerbaijani party organization he was found to be personally 
responsible for the disorders tht took place in the autonomous 
region 
tass said the plenum also dismissed from the party dm 
muslimzade the former first secretary of the sumgait city 
committee for serious shortcomings in organizational and 
political work that brought about the tragic developments in 
sumgait 
in another development grigoryants said police in yerevan had 
detained two friends of paruyr ayrikyan an armenian nationalist 
arrested in march 
the two mofses gorgisyan and nehak gabrilyan were accused of 
organizing a protest on thursday were held for 10 hours and fined 
the equivalent of 80 he said the two are members of ayrikyans 
nationalist group called the alliance for national 
selfdetermination 
on saturday about 50000 armenians in yerevan were said to have 
gathered to demand that authorities free ayrikyan 
ayrikyan 38 emerged as a primary spokesman for activists 
shortly after armenians began demonstrating feb 13 for annexation 
of nagornokarabakh he remains jailed charged with spreading 
false information discrediting the soviet union

george bush seeking to develop a 
platform for the general election contest was consulting economic 
advisers today at his oceanside retreat here 
among those expected to meet with bush was martin feldstein a 
former chairman of president reagans council of economic advisers 
the outspoken feldstein now a harvard economist quit his post in 
reagans first term after clashes with other white house aides over 
his advocacy of a tax increase to help balance the federal budget 
bush like reagan has vowed opposition to any tax increases 
money for bushs campaign is another issue under close scrutiny 
during his week in maine 
though he has been able to raise money quickly through the 
primary season he has now nearly reached the primary spending 
limit of about 29 million including money for accounting costs 
bush told reporters on tuesday that he might have to cut back on 
his travel plans the rest of the summer that is one of the items 
his strategists are discussing this week 
its expensive to take this show on the road bush said to 
reporters tuesday 
the economists he was meeting with today also included michael 
j boskin a professor of economics at stanford university who is 
among bushs top economic advisers 
bush has sought to closely identify himself with the record 
65month peacetime economic expansion and one of his closest 
economic advisers is treasury secretary james a baker iii 
a baker protege former deputy treasury secretary richard 
darman now a consultant with shearson lehman brothers a wall 
street brokerage firm will be among those visiting with the vice 
president today 
also invited to bushs summer home were richard rahn chief 
economist for the us chamber of commerce and kathleen eickhoff 
a private economist who was formerly the chief economist for the 
office of management and budget 
reps lynn martin rill and bill frenzel rminn and sen 
james mcclure were also expected to participate in todays session 
on monday bush confirmed that he had met recently with 
embattled attorney general edwin meese iii and that the two 
discussed the impact of meeses current predicament on bushs 
campaign 
bush campaign aides have said that meese is a political 
liability making it difficult for bush to pursue his theme of 
returning high ethical standards to public office 
bush told reporters on monday that he had met recently with 
meese and that the attorney general had promised to do nothing to 
endanger bushs presidential campaign 
bush has said in the past and he reiterated on monday that he 
would withhold judgment on meese pending the report by the 
independent counsel due out shortly 
meese said in a broadcast interview monday night that if he were 
to quit before the report is out it could reflect badly on bush 
if i were to quit now for example it would be a real 
liability because people would say there was something wrong 
meese said on cnns larry king live 
however he said he would not rule out a departure before the 
end of the summer 
meese added that his justice department has a remarkable 
record that will be an asset to any republican running for office 
this fall 
bush gave the keynote address on monday at a memorial day parade 
here in the town square of kennebunkport his vacation home 
in that speech in the rain bush praised the efforts of 
president reagan in reaching an arms limitation agreement with the 
soviet union and said that if elected he would seek to reach 
additional agreements including ones to eliminate chemical and 
biological warfare

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev played tour 
guide to president reagan today showing him the sights on 
cobblestoned red square near historic st basils church with its 
famous onion domes 
the superpower leaders strolled on the square where hundreds of 
people were lined up to see lenins tomb after they extended their 
meeting at the kremlin by more than an hour 
they chatted with groups of clapping tourists gathered in the 
square amid heavy security when reagan mentioned peace and 
friendship people said thank you good in russian 
it was wonderful i had never actually seen red square the 
77yearold president said later 
like an american politician gorbachev picked up a toddler in a 
multicolored suit and said to the little boy do you recognize 
the president the child did not respond 
gorbachev pointed out various features of red square which dates 
from the 15th century joking there should be no perestroika 
no rebuilding here 
when one woman mentioned peace gorbachev said women are more 
active but men want peace too reagan also commented on the 
female sex 
i was just saying to the general secretary how much i have 
great admiration for the women of russia they are courageous he 
said 
the two men seemed in a good humor what we have decided to do 
is talk to each other rather than about each other and its working 
just fine reagan said 
gorbachev said he and reagan sometimes criticized each others 
country but i see that some of this is a misconception about 
each other

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
an affirmative action plan designed to increase the number of 
blacks in the district of columbia fire department 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the plan 
calling for hiring at least six blacks for every 10 job openings 
unlawfully discriminates against whites 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year that the 
hiring quota violates federal law and the constitution 
relying on recent supreme court rulings the appeals court said 
the plan is not narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination 
the appeals court noted for example that since 1981 about 75 
percent of those hired as city firefighters are black 
the appeals court said we are entirely at a loss to discern 
any act of hiring discrimination much less any pattern or practice 
of discrimination that the quota seeks to remedy there were no 
presentday impediments to black hiring there were no relics from 
yesteryear to overcome 
the appeals court added to be valid raceconscious remedies 
must in fact be remedial in nature they are not to promote the 
utopian goal as some might see it of a society in strict 
proportional racial balance in every employment setting from brain 
surgery to basketball 
the appeals court overturned a federal judges decree approving 
the plan 
the plan had been challenged by white firefighters and the 
reagan administration 
city officials in asking the supreme court to reinstate the 
plan said the appeals court ruling has crippled voluntary 
efforts by government employers to eliminate discriminatory 
barriers to employment and to cure the lingering effects of past 
unlawful discrimination 
city officials said past discrimination was caused in part by a 
written test for firefighters used from 1969 to 1980 that was not 
related to the job and resulted in the hiring of whites for most 
openings 
the city also said that the appeals court ruling has put the 
fire department in a bind with some 100 firefighter vacancies now 
city officials note that congress in an appropriations bill for 
the district of columbia effectively has barred the fire 
department from hiring at random from among applicants 
the city has hired a testing firm to develop an examination for 
hiring firefighters that would pass legal muster but the exam is 
not expected to be completed until 1989 
also at stake in the case could be back pay and seniority for 
whites allegedly discriminated against by the affirmative action 
plan 
the reagan administration urging the justices to reject the 
citys appeal said the hiring quota is improper because there is 
no continuing segregation that must be addressed 
justice department lawyers noting that some 38 percent of the 
district of columbia firefighters are black said that compares 
very favorably to the 29 percent black population in the greater 
washington metropolitan area that includes parts of maryland and 
virginia 
city officials said the relevant figure is the 64 percent 
workingage black population within the borders of the nations 
capital approximately 70 percent of the city governments 
workforce is black 
the citys appeal was supported by state officials in 
california illinois maryland ohio south carolina and wyoming 
civil rights groups also urged the high court to reinstate the 
plan they said the appeals court ruling if adopted elsewhere 
could have a devastating impact on voluntary efforts to fight 
racial discrimination 
the case is barry vs us 871150

the supreme court today refused to resurrect 
federal rules that would force cable television operators to carry 
all local tv signals on their systems 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that struck down 
as unconstitutional interim mustcarry rules adopted by the 
federal communications commissions in 1986 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last december that 
the rules which were to be imposed for five years violated 
freespeech rights 
the national association of broadcasters the association of 
independent television stations and other broadcast organizations 
urged the justices to reinstate the rules saying they fear cable 
operators may drop their overtheair signals 
the appeals court said the need for such rules is more 
speculative than real 
lawyers for the fcc agreed and urged the justices to reject the 
broadcasters appeals 
the appeals court in 1985 said the commissions original set of 
rules unlawfully coerce speech because they required cable 
operators to carry local broadcasters signals irrespective of 
whether the operator considered them appropriate programming 
after the supreme court refused in 1986 to disturb that ruling 
the commission issued the interim rules forcing cable system 
operators to carry local signals for five years 
the rules entitled a television station to insist that its 
signal be retransmitted on any cable system serving the stations 
local service area 
cable systems especially those with fewer channels have 
opposed the rules because they often were forced to run the same 
programming on a number of stations if stations they are required 
to carry broadcast programs from the same television network 
for example a cable system in maryland might be forced to carry 
the signal of the nbc affiliates in baltimore and washington even 
though the programming is identical much of the time 
in its december ruling the appeals court said the fccs 
reimposition of mustcarry rules on a fiveyear basis neither 
clearly furthers a substantial governmental interest nor is of 
brief enough duration to be considered narrowly tailored in 
imposing restrictions on speech 
in one of the appeals acted on today lawyers for the national 
association of broadcasters contended that the appeals court ruling 
could affect what television programming is available to tens of 
millions of american families 
the lower court has made the television choices that are 
available to these homes largely dependent on the economic and 
political predilections of the only cable operator to provide cable 
service in any given neighborhood the appeal argued 
but justice department lawyers representing the fcc told the 
court that during the 16 months between the appeals courts 
invalidation of the original mustcarry rules and imposition of the 
interim rules cable operators generally did not stop carrying 
local broadcast signals 
they said the appeals courts ruling gives the commission an 
opportunity to observe how broadcasters and the cable industry will 
operate without mustcarry rules 
if experience as opposed to prediction proves that 
mustcarry rules are needed to advance public interests the 
commission may build a record supporting new mustcarry rules and 
defend those rules in the courts the government lawyers said 
the cases are office of communications of the united church of 
christ vs fcc 871487 corporation for public broadcasting vs 
century communications 871506 national association of 
broadcasters vs century communications 871510 and association 
of independent television stations vs century communications

the supreme court today left intact a 25 
million fine against a businessman for what prosecutors called the 
biggest checkkiting fraud in the history of american banking 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question rejected a challenge to a new york law that says those 
convicted in such schemes may be forced to pay fines equal to twice 
the amount gained through their criminal conduct 
edward j halloran was convicted of defrauding marine midland a 
new york city bank of 23 million through a complex synchronized 
drawing and depositing of some 15000 checks 
the evidence showed that halloran had accounts at marine midland 
and citibank and that he kept shifting funds from one to the other 
for a oneyear period that began april 1 1983 
his admitted aim was to save his financial empire including the 
taft hotel in new york a holiday inn in fort washington pa and 
several concrete companies 
halloran was sentenced to six months in jail and fined 25 
million harold f madden a codefendant who was not involved in 
the appeal acted on today was ordered to perform 120 hours of 
community service and was fined 100000 
halloran said his fine is excessive and violates his 
constitutional rights he denied that he made anything like a 25 
million profit from the checkkiting scheme 
but state judge carol berkman in upholding the fine said 
prosecutors demonstrated that the fraud enabled halloran not only 
to save his empire without paying interest but also that his 
holdings substantially increased in value 
hallorans gain from the fraud was said to be more than 22 
million 
moreover the judge said at trial to avoid a grand larceny 
conviction the defendants were eager to show the health of 
hallorans financial empire 
afterward the judge said the empire became moribund its 
gains limited to the amount pumped in from the kite its losses 
oppressive and all but wiping out any capital gains 
these selfserving arguments and conclusions at sentence did 
not rebut the peoples evidence that defendants gains went well 
beyond the monies taken in the course of the kite and returned to 
marine midland bank upon discovery of the fraud the judge said 
halloran argued that he borrowed the money from the bank and 
intended to repay it 
he repaid marine midland some 23 million after a shortfall in 
that amount was discovered in his account at the bank 
in urging the supreme court to hear hallorans appeal his 
lawyers said the case could have a bearing on government seizures 
of property and profits from illegal drug operations and other 
criminal enterprises covered by the federal racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations act 
constitutional questions concerning the applicable standard of 
proof and the permissible limits of the term gain are both 
important and recurring they said 
the lawyers said it is unconstitutional for a defendant to be 
ordered to pay a fine up to twice the amount of the alleged gain 
when proof of that gain is based only on a preponderance of the 
evidence the standard used in the new york law most often used 
in criminal cases is the more stringent beyond a reasonable 
doubt standard of proof 
the case is halloran vs new york 871595

the supreme court today let stand a 5 million 
punitivedamages award won by a california savings and loan 
association against an ohiobased insurance company 
the justices over two dissenting votes refused to hear 
arguments that the award believed to be the largest of its kind 
ever upheld in california courts is unconstitutionally excessive 
justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy voted to 
hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such 
review 
justice john paul stevens did not participate in the case for 
uannounced reasons 
the high court earlier this month passed up deciding in a 
mississippi case whether the ban on excessive fines imposed by 
the constitutions eighth amendment applies to noncriminal cases 
no court ever has applied the constitutional principle to 
noncriminal cases 
a california jury awarded the downey savings and loan 
association 123769 in compensatory damages and 5 million in 
punitive damages after ruling that the ohio casualty insurance co 
a wholly owned subsidiary of ohio casualty corp had denied 
insurance benefits in bad faith 
downey had been insured by ohio casualty insurance against any 
dishonest or fraudulent act by the savings and loans employees 
downey sought to collect on that insurance bond after one of its 
branch managers allegedly took part in a conspiracy to bilk downey 
for hundreds of thousands of dollars 
downey claimed the scheme was partially successful and resulted 
in a lawsuit against the savings and loan by the american funding 
corp 
in defending against that suit downey paid over 68000 in 
legal fees and 55000 in settlement costs downey in 1977 sought 
reimbursement of those expenses from ohio casualty insurance 
the jury in 1984 found that ohio casualty acted in bad faith in 
denying downeys claim 
the challenged 5 million award was upheld by a state appeals 
court and the california supreme court refused to hear ohio 
casualtys appeal last may 29 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for ohio casualty argued 
that the punitive damages award and the way it was awarded are 
the inevitable yet unpredictible products of a system 
fundamentally out of control in which fines are becoming larger and 
are imposed more frequently 
some state legislatures reacting to soaring insurance rated in 
recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be 
recovered in personalinjury lawsuits 
new hampshire has abolished the awarding of punitive damages 
those aimed at punishing wrongful conduct that harms others and 
deterring such conduct in the future 
some commentators have decried soaring damages awards charging 
that such a trend spurs more lawsuits some of them frivolous and 
that it overcompensates injured people 
but other commentators contend that awarding punitive damages in 
addition to compensatory damages serves a vital public interest in 
deterring wrongful conduct 
the case is ohio casualty insurance co vs downey savings and 
loan association 87159

the supreme court today refused to reduce a 
jury award of more than 112 million won from a tampon 
manufacturer by the family of a kansas woman who died of toxic 
shock syndrome 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by playtex 
holdings inc seeking to reduce the award 
playtex was sued by kelly ogilvie whose wife betty died 
april 2 1983 
his lawsuit charged that mrs ogilvie a mother of two 
children died from toxic shock syndrome caused by her use of 
playtex superabsorbent tampons 
the companys warning on its package that tampons are 
associated with toxic shock syndrome was inadequate the suit 
said 
a jury awarded actual damages of 15 million and punitive 
damages of 10 million playtex was ordered to pay 80 percent of 
the actual damage award and all of the punitive damages 
but a federal judge reduced the punitivedamages amount to 135 
million on condition that playtex withdraw its superabsorbent 
tampon from the market 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
ruling in june 1987 and restored the full 10 million award 
the appeals court said the record reveals abundant evidence 
that playtex deliberately disregarded studies and medical reports 
linking highabsorbency tampon fibers with increased risk of toxic 
shock there is evidence that playtex deliberately sought to profit 
by advertising the effectiveness of its highabsorbency tampons 
when it knew other manufacturers were reducing the absorbency of 
their products 
the appeals court also said the judge lacked adequate grounds to 
reduce the punitive award 
the reduction only would be proper if the judge found the award 
was so excessive that it shocks the judicial conscience the 
appeals court said 
it said by lessening the judgment in return for playtex 
agreement to withdraw the highabsorbency tampons the judge 
rewarded the company for continuing its injurycausing conduct 
long enough to to use it as bargaining chip 
toxic shock caused by bacteria in the vaginal tract was first 
linked to tampon use in the mid1980s by the federal center for 
disease control 
the case is playtex holdings vs ogilvie 871021

president reagan in an extraordinary 
questionandanswer session with soviet students said today that 
the united states would like nothing better than to help in the 
search for soviet soldiers missing in afghanistan 
the session covering topics as diverse as the plight of 
american indians to the twoterm restriction on american presidents 
and arms control followed the presidents speech at moscow 
university he took questions from a stage beneath a towering bust 
of lenin and a banner emblazoned with a hammer and sickle 
reagan noted that there once had been hopes that he and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev could mark the moscow summit by signing 
a sweeping treaty to cut strategic nuclear weapons by half 
there are many things still to be settled reagan said all 
but confirming the treaty will not be signed this week 
it is not completed there are still points that are being 
debated said reagan who has only one more scheduled meeting 
with gorbachev before departing thursday 
we are both hopeful that it can be finished before i leave 
office in january he said if it isnt i assure you that i 
will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it 
is signed 
one student told reagan tht there are 310 soviet soldiers 
missing in afghanistan after eight years of fighting the student 
asked if reagan would assist in the search and return of the forces 
very much so reagan replied we would like nothing better 
than that the united states has vowed to continuing supporting 
the afghan rebels as long as the kremlin supportsthe kremlinbacked 
regime in kabul 
another student told reagan that a delegation of american 
indians had traveled here because they found it impossible to meet 
with him in washington reagan said he did not know they had sought 
an audience and that id be very happy to see them 
he said the united states had given the indians millions of 
acres of land and established reservations where they could live if 
they chose weve done everything we can to meet their demands as 
to how they want to live maybe we made a mistake maybe we should 
not have humored them and insisted that they become integrated in 
american life 
as for the delegation here he said i dont know what their 
complaint might be 
the questionandanswer session followed a speech in which 
reagan preached free markets freedom of speech and the american 
way of life 
the appearance at the university where mikhail s gorbachev 
earned a degree in 1954 was one in a string of events undertaken 
by reagan to promote the concept of freedom and human rights white 
house planners said the appearance gave reagan an opportunity to 
pass along some thoughts to a generation that one day will govern 
the soviet union 
progress is not foreordained he said the key is freedom 
freedom of thought freedom of information freedom of 
communication he praised the economic progress of such 
freemarket citadels as singapore south korea and taiwan and he 
added 
perhaps most exciting are the winds of change blowing over the 
peoples republic of china where onequarter of the worlds 
population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom 
as if that was not challenge enough to the worlds other major 
communist state reagan said he hoped that soviet families will 
soon be free to visit their relatives overseas 
recently a few individuals and families have been allowed to 
visit relatives in the west we can only hope that it wont be long 
before all are allowed to do so and ukrainianamericans 
balticamericans armenianamericans can freely visit their 
homelands just as this irishamerican visits his 
extolling the importance of a free enterprise system in which 
entrepreneurs may try and sometimes fail reagan said its so 
hard for government planners no matter how sophisticated to ever 
substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to 
make their dreams come true 
the fact is bureaucracies are a problem around the world 
reagan said americans make no secret of our belief in 
freedom and exercise it by choosing a new president every four 
years and enjoying freedom of religion speech and assembly and a 
judicial system where the accused is presumed innocent until proven 
guilty 
freedom is the right to question and change the established 
way of doing things the president said 
he said that in his talks with gorbachev i have spoken of how 
important it is to institutionalize change to put guarantees on 
reform 
and we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a 
divided world the berlin wall reagan said it is time to 
remove the barriers that keep people apart 
he told the students they are living in one of the most 
exciting hopeful times in soviet history it is a time when the 
first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the 
accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual energies 
of a long silence yearn to break free 
he said we do not know what will be the conclusion of this 
journey but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be 
fulfilled 
in this moscow spring this may 1988 we may be allowed that 
this hope that freedom like the fresh green sapling planted over 
tolstoys grave will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile 
soil of your people and culture 
at a meeting earlier today with writers artists film makers 
and others reagan said freedom for the arts has been expanded in 
the soviet union in recent years we hope to see it go further 
we hope to see the works of alexander solzhenitsyn published in the 
land he loves and we hope to see a permanent end to creative 
restrictions on all writers and artists 
we want this not just for your sake but for our own reagan 
said we believe the greater freeoms in other countries the more 
secure our own freedoms and peace 
he said both artists and political leaders had to be able to 
grasp a vision and to put it into life 
by the way ive found that mr gorbachev has the ability to 
grasp and hold a vision and i respect him for that reagan told 
the 38 intellectuals assembled in the house of writers elegant 
wood paneled restaurant 
praising what he called the recent thaw in the soviet arts 
reagan said he hoped all constrictions on the arts would finally 
fall and that artists like ballet dancer mikhail baryshnikov and 
cellist and conductor mstislav rostropovich would once again 
perform in their homeland 
the presidents speech drew a warm standing ovation afterwards 
writer fyodor burlatsky called it one of the best speeches of his 
life 
he spoke very sincerely he spoke about his private life he 
mentioned all the names which are very dear to russian 
intelligentisa burlatsky said 
sergei zalygin editor of novy mir a literary journal which has 
published several previously banned works recently was asked 
whether he thought solzhenitsyns works would appear yes he 
said declining to forecast when and saying this depended on 
negotiations with solzhenitsyn himself

the supreme court today let stand a 35 
million punitivedamages award won by a san diego gas station 
operator against atlantic richfield co 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the award believed to be the second largest of its kind ever 
upheld in california courts is unconstitutionally excessive 
john v nielsen had operated an arco station as an independent 
dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station 
to a minimarket and selfservice station in 1979 
his lawsuit charged arco with fraudulently misrepresenting facts 
in connection with the conversion of his station 
a state court jury awarded nielsen 525788 in compensatory 
damages 79061 in outofpocket losses 396727 in lost 
anticipated profits and 50000 for emotional distress 
the jury also awarded him 35 million in punitive damages 
against arco 
a state appeals court upheld the award except for the 
emotionaldistress damages and the california supreme court 
refused to hear arcos appeal 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for arco argued that the 
huge punitivedamages award seven times the compensatorydamages 
award violates the eighth amendments ban on excessive fines 
no court has ever applied that constitutional principle to 
noncriminal cases 
the supreme court in may passed up deciding in a mississippi 
case whether the constitutional ban on excessive fines can be 
applied to personalinjury lawsuits 
some state legislatures reacting to soaring insurance rates in 
recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be 
recovered in personalinjury lawsuits 
lawyers for arco urged the justices to send a clear signal 
that the state courts must stop these gargantuan awards 
but lawyers for nielsen argued that the arco appeal should not 
be granted because the oil companys lawyers had not raised the 
excessive fines argument in state courts 
the justices refused to address the punitivedamages issue in 
the mississippi case decided earlier this month after noting that 
it had not been raised in state courts 
arcos appeal did not challenge the 475000 
compensatorydamages award won by nielsen 
the case is atlantic richfield vs nielsen 871196

the aluminum company of america failed today 
in its supreme court bid to avoid having to pay part of a 275000 
award to an idaho woman hit in the eye by a twistoff cap from a 
7up bottle 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that alcoa which 
makes the caps was partly at fault in the accident 
carolyn sliman of gooding idaho lost the sight in her left eye 
when the cap shot off the bottle oct 9 1979 
mrs sliman was using a pair of needlenose pliers to try to 
remove the pilferproof band that secures the cap to the bottle 
a jury found that mrs sliman was partly at fault but it also 
determined that alcoa knew the use of tools to remove the cap could 
cause it to blow off and should have done more to warn consumers 
of the hazard 
mrs sliman was awarded 130000 from alcoa and 145000 from 
7up 
the idaho supreme court last november ruled there was 
substantial evidence that alcoa not only foresaw but had actual 
knowledge of consumers using tools to remove caps the jury 
readily could have found that alcoa could have foreseen carolyn 
slimans actions 
alcoa should have done more to assure that 7up warned its 
customers of the danger the state court said 
in the appeal acted on today alcoa said mrs sliman would not 
have been injured if she had simply twisted the cap off the 
bottle as approximately 83 million other aluminum caps had been 
removed prior to her injury 
but the idaho supreme court said there also were consumer claims 
that caps had blown off such bottles 229 times in the past and that 
alcoa was aware of the claims 
the case is alcoa vs sliman 861569

new yorks policy of forcing elected judges to 
retire at age 70 even though no such mandatory retirement is 
imposed on appointed judges was left intact by the supreme court 
today 
the justices four of whom are over 70 threw out an appeal by 
eight current or former new york judges who say the retirement 
policy violates the constitutions equalprotection guarantees 
the court cited the lack of a substantial federal question 
in dismissing the appeal 
the new york policy reflected in the states constitution and a 
state law was upheld by the new york court of appeals last sept 3 
the states highest court ruled that the differing treatment of 
elected and appointed judges is valid 
the state policy previously had applied to state and local 
judges in new york whether elected or appointed a challenge to it 
was rejected by the supreme court in 1985 
but the federal age discrimination in employment act which 
originally protected only people between 45 and 70 and does not 
apply to elected officials was amended in 1987 to bar employment 
discrimination against people over 70 
new yorks policy subsequently was changed to exempt appointed 
judges sparking the equalprotection challenge 
that the state policy requiring retirement of judges is 
partially frustrated because the federal statute preempts it with 
respect to appointed judges does not render the policy irrational 
and the state is free to pursue that policy to the extent doing so 
is consistent with federal law the state court ruled 
the state court used the least stringent standard of review for 
equalprotection challenges in which courts decide whether a law 
or governmental policy that allows differing treatment is rational 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the five state judges 
argued that differing treatment based on age should spark the same 
stringent standard of review in courts as does differing treatment 
based on race 
the state court of appeals rejected that argument 
the eight judges who challenged the state policy are benjamin 
glass an elected state trial judge in new york city forced to 
retire in 1981 benjamin nolan and louis grossman elected new york 
city civil court judges barbara kaiser and ralph diamond elected 
state family court judges in westchester and nassau counties 
respectively who turned 70 last year samuel greenstein an 
elected new york city civil court judge who is 65 and james p 
griffin and h buswell roberts whose judicial positions were not 
listed in submitted court documents 
federal judges including supreme court justices are appointed 
for life the four justices over 70 are william j brennan 
thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and byron r white 
the case is diamond vs cuomo 871361

states sometimes may execute convicted 
murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyers help was 
violated the supreme court ruled today 
by a 53 vote the justices said for the first time that such 
errors may be deemed harmless 
but the justices voted 80 in stating that such an error in the 
prosecution of convicted texas murderer john satterwhite was not 
harmless the decision overturned his death sentence 
the high court in 1981 ruled that a defendant facing a possible 
death sentence if convicted has the right to consult with a lawyer 
before submitting to a psychiatric examination designed to 
determine his future dangerousness 
writing for the court today justice sandra day oconnor said 
violations of that right do not necessarily mean that an ensuing 
death sentence in part based on a finding of future dangerousness 
must be thrown out 
the court refused to adopt an automatic rule that would call for 
reversing the death sentence in any case in which such a violation 
occurs 
a we believe that a reviewing court can make an intelligent 
judgment about whether the erroneous admission of psychiatric 
testimony might have affected a capital sentencing jury oconnor 
said 
the ruling thus leaves to a casebycase review the fates of 
other death row inmates whose right to consult with a lawyer before 
taking such tests were violated 
oconnor was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white john paul stevens and antonin scalia 
justices thurgood marshall william j brennan and harry a 
blackmun favored imposing an automatic rule to strike down any 
death sentence in a case in which such a constitutional violation 
occurred 
the unique nature of a capital sentencing determination should 
cause this court to be especially hesitant ever to sanction 
harmlesserror review of constitutional errors that taint capital 
sentencing proceedings marshall wrote for himself and brennan 
he said an error such as the one in satterwhites case should 
not be subject to a harmlesserror review 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case 
satterwhite was convicted of the march 12 1979 murder of mary 
frances davis a convenience store clerk in san antonio 
the case is satterwhite vs texas 866284

police used an undercover agent 
posing as a prospective buyer today to recover three 19thcentury 
masterpieces including works by vincent van gogh and paul cezanne 
all three paintings taken from amsterdams municipal museum last 
month were recovered undamaged according to police spokesman klaas 
wilting 
the paintings valued at up to 52 million were seized when 
police raided a hotel and arrested a 36yearold man who was 
selling them for 114 million wilting said the money was 
confiscated during the raid at the pullman hotel he said 
the paintings are van goghs 1888 carnations the 1894 still 
life bottle with apples by cezanne and a work by dutch painter 
johan jongkind the house of maitre billaud in nevers done in 
1874 
in their predawn raid police found the van gogh inside the 
hotel and the two other paintings in a car parked outside wilting 
said the artworks were wrapped in blankets wilting said 
another police spokesman joost van wijngaarden said an 
undercover police officer had posed as a buyer in the deal but he 
refused to give details 
two other people thought to be genuine prospective buyers also 
were arrested police said earlier all suspects were being held 
pending charges none were identified in line with dutch police 
practice 
police refused to say whether the undercover police officer was 
posing as a partner of the other two prospective buyers or whether 
police had a role in raising the substantial amount of cash 
there was no immediate word whether the alleged seller who has 
a police burglary record was involved in the may 20 breakin and 
theft at the municipal museum in that incident a groundfloor 
window was smashed to gain access to the museum 
last week police received anonymous tips that buyers for the 
paintings were being solicited abroad wilting said 
we got hard evidence of that early this week and thats when 
we decided to act said wilting 
museum director wim beeren said when the paintings were stolen 
that they are so famous it would be almost impossible to sell them 
on the open market he speculated they were stolen on commission by 
a private collector 
the three works were only insured for fire damage but beeren 
said at the time the huge loss estimate was due in part to the 
record prices paid for recently auctioned van goghs 
last november a collector paid 53 million for van goghs 
irises at a new york auction and eight months earlier the 
artists sunflowers was auctioned in london for 298 million 
however experts at the christies auction firm in london said 
soon after the amsterdam burglary that the three paintings together 
were worth just 11 million with van goghs estimated at about 2 
million experts at the amsterdam museum put the value of the three 
at up to 52 million 
the smashed window in the may burglary at the municipal museum 
triggered an electronic alarm at the museums private security 
firm which reportedly took 20 minutes to warn police and 
investigate the burglary 
the museum holds about 3200 mainly 19th and 20thcentury 
artworks but has had no night guard since 1975 when 
roundtheclock surveillance was abolished as an economy measure

wr grace co pleaded guilty today to charges it 
lied about the amount of a hazardous chemical it used at its plant 
in woburn where residents have blamed pollution of drinking water 
for six cancer deaths 
us district judge joseph l tauro fined the new yorkbased 
chemical company the maximum 10000 for understating the amount of 
acetone bought by its cryovac division in woburn 
the judge as part of an agreement between wr grace and 
federal prosecutors dismissed a second charge against the company 
that it had concealed the fact that waste materials had on numerous 
occassions been dumped behind the plant 
in a separate civil suit filed by eight woburn familes grace 
was found liable for polluting town wells the case was settled in 
1986 for a reported 8 million 
in februrary 1982 the company asserted in a letter to the 
federal environmental protection administration that it had bought 
only one fivegallon pail of acetone in 1978 for the woburn plant 
the company said that acetone purchase was the only one it made 
for the woburn plant in 22 years covered by the epa inquiry 
assistant us attorney tobin harvey told tauro that from 1973 
to 1976 grace had bought 65 gallons of acetone and had used the 
solvent repeatedly in the 1960s and 1970s to clean paint spray guns 
and circuit boards at cryovac a food packaging machine shop 
wr grace attorney robert popeo told the judge that no company 
officials were aware of that the reports to the epa were inaccurate 
at the time they were filed 
no one suspected they committed any act that would have 
been hazardous popeo said 
wr grace was charged by a federal grand jury in january 1987 
with lying to the government about chemicals it used at the cryovac 
plant located near two contaminated woburn wells 
the twocount indictment charged that in 1982 grace knowingly 
and falsely reported to the epa amounts of toxic chemicals bought 
and used at cryovac 
the indictment also charged that grace concealed the dumping 
outside the plant from the epa

the nations legislators are having their usual headaches over 
budgets and taxes but theyve also found time this year to debate 
the merits of key lime pie in florida banana slugs in california 
and gold in them thar black hills 
its all part of the perennial mania for naming official state 
symbols for just about everything under the sun from state song to 
state insect 
supporters say the custom can boost tourism get young people 
involved in the political process and provide harmless comic relief 
for lawmakers 
opponents say it wastes time and money and makes legislators 
look foolish 
it gets so tense in there sometimes its just too much 
said rep mary vanderlinde in south dakota where this years 
legislature designated the triceratops a planteating dinosaur as 
the official fossil and black hills gold as the official jewelry 
this livens it up and then people will relax and get back to 
work 
black hills gold was honored for its economic importance to 
south dakota about 2000 people work in the states mining 
industry and 500 more are employed in making jewelry from the gold 
minutes after the gold measure was passed by the house in 
january lawmakers adopted a second tongueincheek resolution 
naming vanderlinde the states official jewel because she takes 
gold shots for arthritis 
everybodys human they enjoy a little touch of 
lightheartedness like anyone else said elaine knapp an editor 
who helps keep track of official state symbols for the council of 
state governments in lexington ky 
sometimes it becomes a tool for schoolkids to become involved 
in state government and lobby the legislature mrs knapp said 
it can also be a recognition of certain things that are 
indigenous to the state 
the latter was the case in rhode island where the legislature 
voted last year to designate the quahog the narragansett indian 
name for clam as the state shellfish the idea was pushed by a 
junior high school shell club 
we are a tourist state and we are an ocean state and if 
for no other reason we should recognize our fishing industry 
said sen jennie d day the bills sponsor its quite serious 
it wasnt done in jest 
she said the quahog is beginning to appear on tourist 
information and billboards 
floridas house voted last month to name the key lime pie the 
official state pie inspired by a legislative report that 
recommended the honor as an excellent way to promote a genuine 
florida product since the pie can only be properly made with key 
limes from florida 
the measure has stalled in the senate where rules chairman 
dempsey barron favors sweet potato pie more common to the panhandle 
in west virginia the senate named the monarch butterfly the 
state insect in response to a campaign by a group of schoolchildren 
people think its crazy but youve got to encourage these 
kids said sen mario palumbo this year one kid got all 
dressed up as a monarch butterfly they were all excited 
the house proved less sympathetic failing even to consider the 
measure 
on thursday the california senate nearly squashed a proposal to 
name the banana slug the states official mollusk sen becky 
morgan had to settle for a chance to have the proposal reconsidered 
in the future 
these things are repulsive i mean look at them the joke 
has to stop here said sen john doolittle as banana slugs oozed 
around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of 
the upper house in sacramento 
no such shenanigans were allowed this year in indiana where 
house speaker paul s mannweiler and senate president pro tem 
robert d garton specifically warned lawmakers not to introduce 
frivolous bills for the biennial short session 
it creates the wrong image for the legislature said garton 
its a frivolous image it creates the image that thats all we 
do and it detracts from the serious business 
but mrs knapp in lexington defended the practice of designating 
symbols 
its not something that takes up a great deal of attention or 
time she said i dont think anybody expects every minute to 
be taken up with something serious maybe its more harmless than 
raising taxes

nancy reagan said today she might 
write a book giving her version of stargazing in the white house 
and that her account will absolutely interest former chief of 
staff donald t regan 
during a flight from moscow to tour this northern soviet city 
the first lady was questioned for the first time about the flap 
over regans recently published memoir for the record 
in the book regan disclosed that mrs reagan consulted an 
astrologer for help in timing the events on president reagans 
schedule the former chief of staff also portrayed the president as 
an incurious passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative 
wife and mediaconscious staff 
regan also made clear his bitterness at being ousted from the 
white house staff at the height of the irancontra affair he 
contended he was the victim of a cabal created and controlled by 
the first lady 
at first mrs reagan refused tuesday to let reporters draw her 
into discussing any of regans allegations everything has been 
said about that that needs to be said she said 
asked if the stars were wrong for providing an answer and 
she gave her questioner a sharp disgusted look 
but when asked if she intended to write her own book about the 
matter she replied could be and laughed heartily 
mrs reagan borrowed a line from a frank sinatra song to 
indicate she was intent on telling her side of the story 
my way she said pointing at herself and repeating sternly 
my way 
will regan be interested in what she has to say she was asked 
she laughed and replied absolutely

forces treaty 
the 56second test started at 635 am at pueblo army depot 
activity 15 miles east of here officials said 
there was a steady bright white light from the end of the 
rocket nozzle extending approximately 7580 feet said depot 
spokeswoman mary wilson 
a brownish plume stretched out horizontally before the wind 
swept it across sagebrushcovered plains and about 50 monitors set 
out by the colorado department of health which will analyze the 
exhaust to see if such firings would pose any threat to the 
environment 
the firing was conducted successfully we expect the test 
itself will be a success from our initial indications wilson 
said 
the intermediate nuclear weapons treaty was ratified last week 
by the senate and copies are scheduled to be exchanged wednesday 
at the summit meeting in moscow between soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and president reagan 
the treaty requires that the armys 420 pershing missiles be 
destroyed and the united states plans to destroy the missiles by 
firing their rocket motors which cannot be reused 
if the test had not been done today it would have had to be 
delayed by at least 30 days because it would have been governed by 
the treaty 
if we were to test fire it it is then treated as an 
elimination of a weapon under the treaty and subject to 
inspection by the soviet inspectors said wilson theyd have 
to witness it we have to give them 30 days notice for an 
elimination inspection 
brad beckham director of the health departments air pollution 
control division said it would be several weeks before a complete 
assessment of the test firing data will be complete 
the health department is requiring the test before the army can 
designate the depot for the 9 million program 
we didnt believe that the composition of the propellant would 
present any significant environmental problem we did have some 
concern for some of the pollutants and the net result from the test 
fire beckham said 
hydrogen chloride which in extremely high levels can be an 
irritant is one of the pollutants the division will be studying 
beckham said 
beckham noted that a similar test burn was conducted in alabama 
in march 
because the army stores and maintains pershings at pueblo the 
installation is the preferred site for demolishing them but three 
other installations also are being considered wilson said

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told president 
reagan today it may be time to bang our fists on the table to 
prod negotiators working on a treaty halving strategic nuclear arms 
stockpiles but it was clear that an agreement would not come at 
this weeks summit 
ill do anything that works reagan said 
officials in both delegations said the goal was to reach an 
agreement before reagan leaves office next january gennady 
gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said that 
unfortunately there will be no more signings beyond minor 
agreements finalized today 
on their third day of talks reagan and gorbachev met in the 
soviet leaders kremlin office sitting beneath a portrait of karl 
marx after their discussions they took an unscheduled stroll on 
red square past the tomb of lenin and shook hands with surprised 
tourists wonderful reagan said of the square

from reporters white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan 
had slept poorly and that everyone in the delegation was tired 
despite a fourday rest stop in helsinki 
nancy reagan asked about her husband said he sleeps fine 
fitzwater said reagan was in good health and his stamina is just 
fine 
at a meeting with soviet students reagan was asked about his 
impression about soviet dissidents and refuseniks with whom he met 
soviet newspapers described one of the dissidents as a collaborator 
with the fascists during world war ii the president said he knew 
nothing about this allegation 
reagan said gorbachev has been most helpful and agreeable 
about correcting the problems incurred by those groups we have 
the same type of thing happen in our country reagan said 
blaming it on bureaucrats 
the soviet leader expressed new hopes for completing a major 
arms treaty but it was not clear whether he was talking about 
getting it done by summits end or merely before reagans term 
concludes next january soviet and american officials have said 
repeatedly they do not expect a strategic arms pact start to be 
concluded here 
during an encounter with reporters reagan was asked if he still 
believed the soviet union was an evil empire as he has called 
it in the past 
standing next to his host reagan said he no longer thought that 
way i was talking about another time another era the 
president said 
the leaders also watched and joined in the applause as secretary 
of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze signed several secondary agreements including a pair 
of arms accords under one such pact agreed to in moscow the 
superpowers will notify each other of the time place and intended 
target of intercontinentalrange missiles tests 
reagan continuing his public relations offensive to promote 
freedom and human rights in the soviet union met over lunch at the 
house of writers with artists filmmakers and writers 
talking to some of the soviet unions leading intellectuals he 
discussed how an actor could become president explaining that 
both artists and political leaders had to be able to grasp a vision 
and to put it into life 
by the way ive found that mr gorbachev has the ability to 
grasp and hold a vision and i respect him for that reagan said

state university reagan said the young people were living in one 
of the most exciting hopeful times in soviet history when the 
first breath of freedom stirs the air

fulfilled 
the president cautioned that progress is not foreordained 
the key is freedom freedom of thought freedom of information 
freedom of communication he cited steps in singapore south 
korea and taiwan adding that the most exciting changes were in 
china where one quarter of the worlds population is now getting 
its first taste of economic freedom

at the kremlin meeting reagan appeared to dig in his heels on 
his strategic defense initiative missile defense plan one of the 
key obstacles to agreement on a strategic arms treaty its never 
been a part of the negotiations he said in response to a 
question 
without addressing star wars gorbachev said he was confident 
there would be progress on arms issues 
and im sure that if the president makes good use of his time 
that we have remaining im sure that we will be able to prepare 
the treaty gorbachev said 
at that point a reporter asked reagan if he too thought a 
treaty could be concluded yes im very pleased to hear what 
theyre saying asked again if a treaty was possible gorbachev 
stepped in to answer saying if that question is to me yes i 
think a start treaty is possible 
the soviet leader recalled that he and reagan at their first 
summit in geneva in 1985 had reached an impasse at one point he 
said that at that point the president said well lets stamp 
our fists on the table i said all right and by morning 
everything was agreed the geneva negotiations were successfully 
completed 
maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the table 
once again gorbachev said 
asked by a reporter if he agreed reagan said ill do

nancy reagan welcomed to the 
venice of the north by tens of thousands of waving and smiling 
people marveled today at the citys art and architectural gems 
after paying homage to the 650000 russians who starved to death in 
leningrad 
mrs reagan placed a bouquet flowers at the monument to the 
heroic defenders located near the front line of world war ii where 
the fiercest battles were fought 
from there she traveled to the hermitage which houses one of 
the most fabulous art collections in the world paintings by 
leonardo da vinci picasso matisse and other great artists can be 
found in the collection begun in 1764 by catherine the great 
staggering staggering theres just too much to digest the 
first lady exclaimed at the end of her fivehour tour of the city 
queried whether she had any more sympathy for communism after 
viewing the extravagent finery used by the imperial family before 
the revolution she replied quickly no 
as she began her tour of the museum mrs reagan was asked about 
the reception the people of leningrad had given her 
wasnt that wonderful she said i was waving hoping they 
would know which car i was in 
the outpouring of affection appeared to be spontaneous 
officials had not released the first ladys motorcade route which 
traveled the length of several of the citys renowned boulevards 
at some points people lined up several deep on the broad sidewalks 
to catch a glimpse of the petite first lady 
en route to leningrad mrs reagan told reporters aboard her 
plane that the soviet people are very warm and very open but 
that she was less impressed with her highlevel contacts their 
philosophies and positions are completely different from ours 
she said 
asked about her handholding with raisa gorbachev mrs reagan 
replied with a shrug of her shoulders i dont know it just 
sort of happened indicating that it was an action that she 
hadnt initiated 
lidiya gromkyo the wife of soviet president andrei gromyko 
accompanied mrs reagan on the trip 
the first lady said she found mrs gromyko very nice very 
friendly very warm but asked if she had the same reaction to 
her tours with mrs gorbachev mrs reagan smiled and sat silent 
for a full 12 seconds pondering her answer 
well shes a everybodys different she finally said 
evoking laughter from the reporters she joined in 
mrs reagan and mrs gorbachev will get back together on 
wednesday to view icons in the famous tretyakhov gallery in moscow 
the trip to leningrad provided reporters with their first chance 
to question mrs reagan about the report by former chief of staff 
donald regan that astrology influenced the presidents schedule 
but she refused to be drawn into any discussion of the matter 
declaring everything has been said about that that needs to be 
said 
but she also promised to tell her own side of the story saying 
regan will absolutely be interested in the contents of the book 
she intends to write 
the first lady started her campaign to visit leningrad and 
particularly the priceless collection of art in the 400 rooms of 
the hermitage museum last december when she mentioned her 
interest to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at a white house 
state dinner 
leningrad was constructed on the northern marshland of the neva 
river by peter the great in the early 1700s and has become a jewel 
of russian historical and cultural treasures but the city is also 
a monument to the strength of the soviet spirit 
the city was first named st petersburg and then petrograd and 
it was the capital of the russian empire from 1703 to 1918 
it was in the forefront of the bolshevik revolution in 1917 and 
its citizens heroically withstood a siege by nazi forces for 900 
days during world war ii 
more than 650000 people died of starvation during the blockade 
and more than 17000 were killed in air raids and artillery 
shelling 
traditionally newlyweds place flowers at the 150foot high 
monument to the heroic defenders composed of an obelisk and 
sculptures with figures such as a mother mourning a dead child 
the hermitages main building catherines winter palace is 
itself a work of art the baroque architecture was done by 
bartolomeo francesco rastrelli an italian who designed several 
other leningrad landmarks 
in all the complex has 1050 rooms 117 staircases 1886 doors 
and 1945 windows and many a visitor has become exhausted trying 
to see the 65000 works occupying 400 rooms in the museum 
even though guides advise spreading a tour over several days 
mrs reagan had less than an hour to spend at the palace 
it proved to be a focal point of the revolution when the troops 
of czar nicholas ii fired on peaceful demonstrators killing as 
many as 30 people in what came to be known as bloody sunday 
the winter palace was a residence of the imperial family until the 
provisional government occupied it in 1917 
the final item on mrs reagans leningrad agenda was a trip by 
hydrofoil to peter the greats summer palace built by the czar as 
a monument to russias victories over the swedes in his struggle to 
find an outlet to the baltic sea 
the interiors of the palace are a collection of sumptuous and 
ornately furnished reception areas but the highlight is the 
collection of cascading fountains canals and gardens

during a questionandanswer session with students at moscow 
state university reagan said there are many things still to be 
settled 
we are hopeful that it can be finished before i leave 
office he said but i assure you if it isnt i will have 
impressed upon my successor that we must carry on until it is 
signed 
in addition to their walk through red square the leaders also 
strolled through the kremlins cathedral square winning applause 
from several dozen onlookers like any politician they waved to 
the crowds moving along with the leaders was a remarkable swarm of 
security agents 
the square had been cleared of people except for hundreds 
standing in a single file to view lenins tomb and eight groups of 
about 25 each stationed in the area of st basils cathedral 
the surprise visit to red square threw the official summit 
schedule out of whack reagan told one cluster of people that 
what we have decided to do is talk to each other rather than 
about each other and its working just fine 
playing the part of tour guide gorbachev pointed out landmarks 
in the historic square and joked there be no perestroika no 
rebuilding here 
reagan and gorbachev approached each of the groups and 
gorbachev introduced the president at each stop the crowds 
applauded warmly 
gorbachev told one group when we meet the president and i 
talk and he sometimes has criticisms about the soviet union i do 
the same about america but i see that some of this is a 
misconception about each other 
shultz and shevardnadze also signed an agreement providing for 
joint tests this summer in nevada and at semipalatinsk of us and 
soviet devices to measure the force of blasts 
another agreement extending for three years and expanding 
ussoviet cultural exchanges was signed by charles z wick the 
director of the us information agency and by soviet culture 
minister vasuky zamharov 
gorbachev told reporters at a kremlin signing ceremony that his 
morning oneonone meeting with reagan dwelled on economic 
questions 
i criticized the position of the president and the congress 
which has put very many roadblocks on the path of development of 
healthy economic cooperation the soviet leader said the 
president considers that we need to move more actively to improve 
this 
mrs reagan broke away from the presidential party and flew to 
leningrad where she viewed the treasures of the hermitage museum 
housing 65000 pieces of art and visited the summer palace of 
peter the great scene of revolutionary soviet history 
halfway through their fourday meeting reagan and gorbachev 
seemed at ease with each other they chatted and laughed together 
monday night at a state dinner in the kremlins frescoed and 
iconcovered hall of facets despite lingering differences on human 
rights arms control and other issues 
nevertheless gorbachev told reagan they should conduct their 
business without interfering in domestic affairs without 
sermonizing or imposing ones views and ways without turning 
family or personal problems into a pretext for confrontation 
between states 
reagan said they should continue searching for common ground 
underscoring his lobbying campaign he gave gorbachev a videotaped 
cassette of an old american movie entitled friendly persuasion 
depicting a story set in the civil war era 
gorbachev could be excused for dividing his attention between 
the summit and a domestic sensation an unprecedented instance of 
a fallen soviet leader publicly criticizing those who ousted him 
former moscow communist party chief boris n yeltsin used a 
british broadcasting corp interview to accuse the kremlins no 2 
official yegor k ligachev of blocking soviet political reforms 
yeltsin had been an outspoken supporter of gorbachevs reforms 
in the interview he said he was hurt by gorbachevs refusal to 
support him after he criticized ligachev at a 1987 meeting of the 
central committee 
meantime the american contingent here was growing senate 
majority leader robert byrd and bob dole boarded an air force 
boeing 707 in washington to fly here to attend a ceremony at which 
reagan and gorbachev will exchange the documents of ratification of 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty the treaty was 
approved by the senate last friday and the soviet presidium the 
following day 
in the absence of agreement on a new major arms treaty on 
strategic nuclear weapons the alreadyratified accord will serve 
as the crowning element of the summit windup on wednesday reagan 
bids gorbachev farewell on thursday and flies to london on friday 
he returns home 
us officials said several cultural and bilateral agreements 
were ready for signing today the two sides have been working on a 
threeyear extension of the educational and cultural exchanges 
signed by the two leaders in geneva in 1985 they also were 
expected to sign agreements on fisheries cooperating on search and 
rescue operations at sea and the exchange of transportation 
technologies 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that reagan and 
gorbachev had discussed on monday but found no agreement on 
reagans plans for a star wars spacebased antimissile 
defense the biggest obstacle to a start agreement to cut 
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent 
soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov reported there was progress 
in two of the most biggest obstacles to a treaty involving mobile 
missiles and cruise missiles fired from warplanes 
however a us official while reporting progress was not as 
upbeat the official who refused to be identified said there 
still were problems in agreeing on how to count the airlaunched 
cruise missiles 
as for landbased mobile missiles the official said we 
havent heard a verification scheme we think will work i would 
not expect closure on the problem 
gorbachev in his kremlin dinner toast said our main task 
continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50 percent 
reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the abm 
treaty the landmark 1972 agreement between the superpowers 
limiting missiledefense systems 
reagan in his answering speech said i intend to pursue the 
search for common ground during the months left to me as president 
when i pass the job on to my successor i intend to tell him it is 
a search that must be continued

the supreme court today unanimously struck 
down the way ohio promotes through tax credits the use of 
gasohol a motor vehicle fuel less environmentally troublesome 
than gasoline 
the court ruled that the ohio taxcredit scheme challenged by a 
gasohol producer in indiana interferes unconstitutionally with 
interstate commerce 
gasohol is the common name for a blend of 90 percent gasoline 
and 10 percent ethanol a 199proof alcohol derived from corn and 
other sources 
use of gasohol reduces the toxic emissions from leaded motor 
vehicle fuels to advance environmental goals most states and the 
federal government have offered tax credits for the production and 
sale of gasohol 
prior to 1985 ohio offered reductions in its fuel taxes for 
fuels containing ethanol regardless or where the ethanol was 
produced 
but since 1985 the state legislature has extended the credit to 
gasohol containing ethanol produced out of state only if it comes 
from a state in which ohioproduced ethanol receives a tax credit 
the credit for gasohol amounts to about 25 cents per gallon 
the reciprocity feature of the state law was challenged by new 
energy co of indiana which produces gasohol at its south bend 
ind plant and in 1985 was shipping about 25 percent of its output 
to ohio distributors 
new energy said it was priced out of the market in ohio when it 
lost its tax incentives 
the ohio supreme court struck down the taxcredit law as 
unconstitutional by a 43 vote in late 1986 but shortly thereafter 
two of the justices in the courts majority were voted out of 
office 
in 1986 the newly constituted state court granted a rehearing 
and ohios tax credit for ethanol was upheld 
today the nations highest court said the ohio supreme court 
was wrong 
scalia said the law imposes an economic disadvantage upon 
outofstate sellers and the promise to remove that if reciprocity 
is accepted no more justifies disparity of treatment than it would 
justify categorical exclusion 
the case is new energy co vs limbach 87654

the supreme court today unanimously overturned 
the murder conviction and death sentence of a georgia man accused 
of a 1977 killing in putnam county 
the justices ruled that tony b amadeo should have been allowed 
to raise the issue of discriminatory jury selection in a federal 
court appeal 
the atlantabased 11th us circuit court of appeals had ruled 
that amadeo was not entitled to raise that issue because his 
lawyers failed to comply with a state procedural rule requiring 
such objections to be raised before trial 
the appeals court rejected a federal judges finding that 
amadeos lawyers could not be expected to have learned about the 
discrimination against women and blacks in the selection of putnam 
county grand juries and juries before amadeos trial began 
in a separate case putnam county officials were found to have 
structured the juryselection process in a way in which blacks and 
women were underrepresented 
writing for the high court today justice thurgood marshall said 
the appeals court should not have rejected the judges finding 
unless convinced it was clearly erroneous 
because there is sufficient evidence in the record considered 
in its entirety to support the district courts factual findings 
the court of appeals should not have set them aside marshall 
said 
the district courts conclusion that amadeos lawyers did 
not deliberately bypass the jury challenge was supported by events 
contemporaneous with the juryselection process marshall added 
amadeo had been convicted in the sept 29 1977 killing of 
james turk sr prosecutors said amadeo was one of three men 
involved in the crime each of whom was a marine absent without 
leave from camp lejeune 
todays decision means georgia officials must give amadeo a new 
trial or set him free

the supreme court today agreed to settle a 
multimillion dollar dispute between delaware and new york over 
unclaimed dividend and interest payments on securities 
the justices granted delawares request that it be allowed to 
sue new york in the supreme court without the case first having 
been heard in some lower court 
the court has such original authority in disputes between 
states 
the conflict stems from the fact that 15 of the nations largest 
stock brokerage firms are incorporated in delaware but based in new 
york 
each year the firms recover substantial amounts of money in 
dividend and interest payments for people who cannot be located 
all states have socalled escheat laws providing that such 
abandoned money goes into the state treasury after remaining 
unclaimed for a certain time 
in delaware the waiting period is seven years in new york it 
is three years 
delawares escheat law is binding on all corporations chartered 
in the state but new york considers brokerage firms with new york 
trading addresses subject to its escheat law and has pursued 
unclaimed payments 
delaware attorney general charles m oberly iii said new york 
has been collecting such payments from delawarechartered brokerage 
firms since 1971 he said more than 50 million could be involved 
oberly told the justices new york should be directed to pay 
delaware amounts already paid to it to which delaware is or will be 
entitled under the delaware escheat law and to cease interfering 
with delawares right to escheat the property of unknowns held by 
the delaware brokerage corporations 
but new york attorney general robert abrams urged the high court 
to reject delawares lawsuit 
he said delaware has not yet exhausted all administrative 
remedies and added that new york is entitled to the dividend and 
interest overpayments held by brokerage firms with new york trading 
addresses 
delawares failure for 17 years to employ new yorks claim 
procedure in contrast to other states or to attempt to negotiate 
with new york before bringing this original action demonstrates 
that the case is not ripe for decision by this court abrams 
argued 
the case is delaware vs new york 111 original

the supreme court today gave federal 
regulators broad power to oust bank executives from their jobs 
temporarily when the executives are accused of serious crimes 
in a 90 ruling the court said the federal deposit insurance 
corp acted properly in suspending an iowa bank president 
the justices upheld a law permitting the fdic to suspend a bank 
executive accused of serious wrongdoing for up to 90 days while the 
agency decides the executives appeal for reinstatement 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said a bank 
executives interest in continued employment is without doubt an 
important interest that ought not be interrupted without 
substantial justification 
but stevens said a suspended officer also has an interest in 
seeing that a decision concerning his or her continued suspension 
is not made with excessive haste 
the case stems from the indictment in 1986 of james e mallen 
president of the now defunct farmers state bank of kanawha iowa 
on charges he made false statements to the fdic 
mallen was accused of concealing financial interests in other 
businesses and of concealing loans his banks made his small 
agricultural bank in a town of 750 people had assets of 18 million 
he was convicted in federal court last year and sentenced to 
three years in prison and fined 10000 he was ordered to spend 
only 60 days in jail and the rest of the sentence was suspended 
prior to his criminal trial the fdic barred him from continuing 
as bank president and director prohibited him from taking part in 
running the bank and said he could not vote his stock in the banks 
holding company 
the fdic acted under a law empowering federal banking regulators 
to suspend executives charged with crimes involving dishonesty or 
breach of trust that are punishable by imprisonment for more than 
one year 
the law gives the executive a right to appeal to the regulatory 
agency but the statute allows the agency to take up to three 
months to resolve the appeal 
moreover the law does not guarantee the banker a chance to 
present oral arguments in making the appeal 
a federal judge ruled mallens rights were violated by the 
suspension and by the ban on oral testimony to the fdic 
the reagan administration on behalf of the fdic appealed the 
ruling to the supreme court 
the case is fdic vs mallen 8782

the murder plot which the prosecution says was hatched because 
the daughter had been promised to someone else in a marriage 
arranged by the parents never was carried out 
the case of dr saud tarawneh 46 and his 44yearold wife 
ghada involves a clash between the american ways of love and the 
familys culture where murder to avenge ones honor is acceptable 
their lawyer says 
keeping body parts as souvenirs i dont think is normal 
said assistant state attorney william dimitrouleas adding that he 
expects unusual testimony in the broward circuit court trial

conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder for allegedly hiring 
an assassin and attempting to have the victims body parts 
preserved and shipped to toledo

find a hit man cooperated with authorities in their criminal 
investigation the assassin was supposed to receive an initial 500 
and 2000 after the killings according to authorities 
agents taped phone conversations between the investigator and 
the family said mike breece an investigator with the florida 
department of law enforcement 
defense attorney barry roderman said threats about killing and 
cutting off body parts are common in the middle east but are 
seldom carried out 
theres a definite clash of cultures here between the arab 
mind and the american mind he said the tarawnehs are from a 
tribe where they handle their problems their own way inside the 
family 
the parents declined to comment 
tarawneh a gynecologist who became a us citizen in 1980 and 
his wife a nurse already had arranged a marriage for their then 
17yearold daughter raniah and refused to allow her to marry

a year cleared the way today for price deregulation of some 
natural gas 
the justices 80 reversed an appeals court ruling that had 
placed a floor under the gas prices 
the appeals court ruling was challenged by the administration 
the new york state public service commission and natural gas 
distributors who buy from producers 
the dispute was over interpretation of the natural gas policy 
act of 1978 a federal law that phases out regulation of natural 
gas prices and is designed to assure an adequate supply of gas for 
delivery across state lines 
prior to the laws enactment there was a ceiling on the price 
of gas sold interstate but no such regulation for gas produced and 
sold within the same state 
the twotier system prompted producers to commit more of their 
supplies to the intrastate market causing shortages in interstate 
supplies of natural gas 
the 1978 law created a complicated system of phasing out price 
controls that divides gas into three categories old new and 
difficulttoproduce gas 
generally the price regulations applied more to old gas and 
lifted controls for new gas to encourage discoveries and production 
old gas is that produced from wells operating before the law was 
passed and new gas is that from wells that began producing after 
the laws passage the third category covers gas produced by 
particuarly highcost methods such as that obtained from between 
layers of more impervious rock 
the gas supplies involved in the case decided today overlap the 
categories qualifying for both regulated and deregulated treatment 
under the 1978 law 
the federal energy regulatory commission in 1985 eliminated 
controls for such dually qualified gas allowing the price to 
be determined by the free market 
the commission said maintaining controls would lead to a 
regulated price higher than the freemarket price an opposite 
effect from the one intended by congress in enacting the 1978 law 
but the 10th circuit court acting on appeals by gas producers 
said the commissions deregulation rule violated the 1978 law 
writing for the high court today justice william j brennan 
said the appeals court wrongly overturned the commissions rule he 
said the commissions interpretation of the 1978 law was correct 
justice byron r white did not participate in the case for 
unannounced reasons 
the case is ferc vs martin exploration management co 87363

fire broke out at a freight terminal early 
today forcing officials to evacuate more than 800 people and close 
schools because of pesticides stored in the building officials 
said 
the fire at a roadway express terminal in a primarily 
residential area just outside the city was reported about 1230 
am said fire capt robert clayton no serious injuries were 
reported 
a dark gray cloud shifted after daybreak and blew several 
hundred feet above a school where most evacuees were taken 
polyvinyl chloride containers caught fire late in the morning 
prompting firefighters to pour water on the blaze to extinguish it 
the containers were smoldering and authorities were concerned that 
the smoke could cause watering of the eyes nausea and diarrhea 
all public and parochial schools in alliance were closed today 
and officials in two districts east of the city also closed some 
schools 
ed mcnabb director of the alliance red cross chapter estimated 
that 800 people including 90 nursing home residents were at 
stanton middle school other evacuees went to the homes of 
relatives and friends 
by midmorning residents were returning to the nursing homes 
because officials said they would be better off there than in the 
crowded school gymnasium 
were quite happy there are no major medical problems said 
william rodman a physician at alliance community hospital who went 
to the school most of the medical problems weve seen are the 
chronic ongoing kind there are only one or two patients 
complaining of symptoms that might be associated with a toxic 
chemical such as burning eyes and nausea 
evacuees came from about 10 square miles around the fire safety 
service director john benincasa urged other people to remain 
indoors because of drifting smoke 
the evacuation was ordered after officials discovered a 
pesticide company stored chemicals in the building said mike 
dalton manager of spill response for the ohio environmental 
protection agency 
officials could not immediately determine what types of chemical 
fumes might be in the air most pesticides break down readily in 
high temperature he said 
officials had originally planning to let the fire burn out to 
reduce possible runoff of contaminated water workers were 
attempting to dam such water as was used 
clayton said roadway express and consolidated trucking used the 
building as a freight terminal while clem lumber co and the dcon 
co used it as a warehouse 
terry g kelley spokesman for sterling drug inc in new york 
said dcon was leasing space to store rodenticides and pesticides 
made at its alliance plant as well as manufacturing components 
alliance is about 50 miles southeast of cleveland and has 24000 
residents

a sharpened consumer appetite for fish and 
seafood offers an opportunity for american farmers to reel in a 
share of a growing worldwide aquaculture industry says a report by 
the agriculture department 
expanding world population and growing consumer demands have 
already forced some nations to harvest previously underutilized 
species of fish and seafood and to develop alternative sources 
the report said 
many commercial fisheries which harvest from the wild are 
approaching their maximum sustainable yield it added thus 
aquaculture growing fish or other aquatic life in a controlled 
environment is expanding 
americans are also honing their appetites last year consuming 
more fish and seafood per person than veal lamb and mutton 
roasting chicken or turkey beef pork and broiler chicken 
however remain far in the lead as american favorites 
in 1980 aquaculture accounted for 13 percent of the global 
production of aquatic foods and goods up from 7 percent in 1970 
industry sources indicate that by the year 2010 aquaculture will 
provide 25 percent of the worldwide aquatic harvest 
the report was included in the june issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine issued by the departments economic research 
service the article was written by economists mike dicks and dave 
harvey 
by 1981 total us fish consumption had grown 30 percent from 
1970 about 47 percent was imported 
population growth accounts for only half the increase the 
report added per capita us consumption of fish and shellfish 
has grown reaching a record 154 pounds edible weight in 1987 
it is expected to expand another 50 percent by 2010 
dicks said in a telephone interview that the 1987 per capita 
consumption figure included only 05 pound of the estimated 3 to 5 
pounds per capita of us aquaculture production the half pound 
he said only included catfish and none of the other species 
ranging from trout and salmon to oysters and shrimp 
despite the recent increases us per capita fish and seafood 
consumption is well behind europe which averages 40 to 45 pounds 
per person and japan which averages 130 to 140 pounds annually 
per capita consumption of veal last year by americans averaged 
15 pounds lamb and mutton 13 mature chicken 25 and turkey 
152 beef consumption was 755 pounds pork 588 and broiler 
chicken 601 those are retail weights as sold by grocery stores 
the us aquaculture industry fish farming has expanded 
greatly in recent years but still is led by catfish produced 
primarily in the south in 1986 for example the us aquaculture 
harvest was nearly 620 million pounds valued at more than 496 
million 
of those amounts catfish comprised 327 million pounds worth 
229 million to growers the report showed 
comparatively in 1980 the total harvest was 203 million pounds 
valued at 192 million with catfish comprising less than 77 
million pounds at a value of 54 million 
catfish crawfish salmon and trout make up about 90 percent of 
the total us aquaculture production 
by 2010 according to industry estimates us aquaculture 
production is expected to exceed 2 billion pounds and that doesnt 
count production from catchout ponds and direct sales to 
consumers the report said 
a study in mississippi showed that for every 10 million 
additional pounds of catfish produced 220 new jobs are created in 
the industry and 1100 jobs are created in related industries 
most catfish are grown in mississippi alabama and arkansas 
while salmon output is mainly in washington and oregon crawfish in 
louisiana and texas and trout in idaho 
channel catfish east mostly soybean products and corn to get a 
pound of catfish requires one pound of soybean meal a half pound 
of corn meal and a half pound of other nutrients 
nearly 55 percent of the usual diet of farmgrown salmon are 
also from the farm 17 percent whey 165 percent wheat germ 15 
percent cottonseed meal and 6 percent soybean oil 
the report said aquaculture is suited to small as well as 
commercial farms and that a modest operation can provide 
significant income 
many agricultural institutions still regard aquaculture as a 
sideline the report said even so aquaculture has become a 
technical and highly capitalized commercial enterprise 
one problem has been the limited information available to 
potential lenders the report said as a result it added many 
federal agencies have been reluctant to aid aquaculture producers 
financially

muscovites responding to their first peek at us 
television news say they wish it had more music and less talk but 
they still are wideeyed over glimpses into the personal lives of 
government leaders and average americans even when they dont 
understand the language 
cables news network is being broadcast into central moscow 
during the summit under an agreement with the state broadcast 
agency gostelradio those muscovites lucky enough to own recent 
model television sets can pick it up on channel 6 
it also is available in the rossiya hotel overlooking red 
square where many foreign journalists are staying maids and 
plainclothes kgb agents are often seen sitting together before 
television sets in halls watching attentively and sometimes with 
the volumn off 
for most it marks the first time they have seen fastpaced 
roundtheclock upcloseandpersonal american television 
television news imported from the united states is a far cry 
from the soviet evening news show vremya the show has been jazzed 
up in recent months with new graphics and backdrops but it is 
still dry and focuses on agricultural reports and politburo 
announcements 
a 46yearold clerk who would only give her first name 
svetlana said she was watching american news this week as often as 
she could 
i enjoyed learning something about the private life of former 
president carter she said smiling shyly i saw him on a 
fishing trip for us this is very unusual 
i would like to see such things about general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev on vremya but for the moment we have only 
rumors about his personal life she said 
svetlana said she understood some english but a lack of 
language comprehension has not stopped soviets from tuning in to 
cnn sometimes for hours 
weve watched at least two hours a night all this week even 
though i dont know any english said lyubov ivanova 50 i 
wish it had more music but im still very interested it is nice 
to see president reagan in moscow and now i would like to see one 
of his movies 
both svetlana and mrs ivanova said they were disappointed that 
the stories on american television which last an average of two or 
three minutes were so short on soviet television an item like a 
gorbachev speech can take up the entire newscast which is 
sometimes extended to two hours 
cnn producer ruth oxenberg said the network was broadcasting its 
program only in central moscow and had received comments and 
telephone calls from soviets which indicated it was widely watched 
we know sometimes official soviets are not happy about the way 
we do our reporting but we think it is good for moscow that we 
were allowed to do this she said 
moscowborn andrei 25 agreed 
i think it is important to see even these small pieces of the 
lives of americans andrei said 
we soviets may be able to learn things that could help us 
he said for example the americans seem so relaxed and social 
compared with us maybe we can learn how to take it easy by 
watching them 
andrei said he was disappointed to learn cnn would go off the 
air here once president reagan leaves moscow on thursday its 
too bad he said i wish american tv could stay here and our 
show vremya could go to the united states television should have 
no borders

schoolteachers began a strike for more pay 
tuesday it was the 20th time in the past three months that public 
schools have been closed because of teacher work stoppages 
unlike past strikes this one was called for an indefinite 
period it was the first indefinite work stoppage by civil servants 
in the public administration since spain returned to democracy in 
1977 
the strike meant no classes for the nearly 6 million students in 
spains public elementary secondary and technical schools there 
is just one month left in the regular school year 
the six unions representing spains 272000 public 
schoolteachers approved the indefinite strike thursday the 
government of prime minister felipe gonzalez broke off negotiations 
after the strike was approved 
teachers are demanding pay parity with civil servants of similar 
qualifications and monthly pay increases of 223 by september 1990 
teachers at elementary schools earn an average of 929 a month 
teachers at secondary and technical schools earn about 1090 a 
month 
on may 4 five of the six teachers unions reached a tentative 
agreement with the education ministry for a monthly pay increase of 
178 by september 1990 
the teachers branch of the communistoriented workers 
commissions union opposed the pact and a referendum was held may 
16 of the teachers who voted 75 percent rejected the pact 
a government decree published last week forces teachers to 
guarantee students their required tests and final exams by june 30 
or face suspension from their jobs for three to six years the 
unions said teachers would comply 
in announcing the breaking off of talks last week government 
spokesman santiago varela said this kind of strike is 
unjustified 
it threatens the constitutionally guaranteed right of 
education for students and impedes further talks in search of a 
reasonable and just solution varela added 
the national confederation of student associations has 
criticized the teachers indefinite strike as has the national 
confederation of parents of students

as michael dukakis moves closer to the 
democratic presidential nomination some florida democrats are 
pressing him to choose sen bob graham as his running mate 
rep bill grant for one is heading a group of floridians 
writing grahampromoting letters to massachusetts gov dukakis as 
well as to uncommitted democratic delegates and other party leaders 
the group has distributed 500 graham for vp buttons and 
grant said a formal committee will be put together as the 
grahambackers expand 
were trying to create a national awareness that he is a 
viable possibility said grant adding that the committee hopes 
to flood the national convention in july with graham banners signs 
and stickers 
another active graham supporter is state aflcio president dan 
miller 
bob graham is not only a favorite son hes a very strong 
candidate miller said he was a very popular southern 
governor and he would bring a southern flavor to the ticket 
other florida democrats have mixed feelings about the effort by 
graham supporters one of the better organized efforts across the 
country to promote possible vice presidential candidates 
though many democrats want dukakis a northeasterner to pick a 
southerner graham isnt the most frequently mentioned possibility 
from that region 
not to take anything away from bob graham because graham is 
very qualified but my strong recommendation would be sam nunn 
the georgia senator said william boyd a tallahassee attorney and 
dukakis supporter 
grahams press secretary ken klein said in washington 
senator graham is not seeking a spot on the ticket he is not 
active in trying to make the phone ring he has been flattered by 
the suggestion that it might ring 
meanwhile state party chairman charles whitehead feels pulled 
in two directions 
the greatest thing for me as party chairman would be bob 
graham on the ticket because i believe that would ensure us of 
carrying florida whitehead said but the worst thing for me 
would be to have gov bob martinez get to appoint a senator 
if graham were elected vice president the republican governor 
would appoint someone to serve as senator until a special election 
in 1990

miles southwest of havana just in time to inaugurate the 1988 
atlantic hurricane season forecasters announced today

meteorologist randy lascody of the national hurricane center 
generally the winds at this time of the year are not favorable 
for that 
even if the weather systems 30 mph winds did strengthen its

probably breaking up the depression he said 
the caribbean system is expected to continue its path through 
wednesday when a reconnaisance plane will investigate 
for a depression to be upgraded to a named storm winds must 
reach 39 mph and the system becomes a hurricane only when it

some drums of chemical waste aboard a 
freighter dubbed the ship of poison are damaged and guinea 
pigs will be used to see if any dangerous substance is leaking the 
port commissioner said tuesday 
more than 2200 tons of unidentified wastes from italian 
chemical companies are in about 12000 drums aboard the freighter 
zanoobia which docked in genoa on sunday after spending more than 
a month anchored off the coast of carrara 
the wastes were originally shipped from italy 15 months ago but 
were rejected by four countries before officials in genoa agreed to 
let them unload 
genoa port commissioner giuseppe francese said the guinea pigs 
will be lowered into the ships holds to see if they suffer any 
toxic effects 
francesco rizzuto a lawyer for the ships owner tabalo 
shipping said a chemical analysis of the wastes must be completed 
before the unloading begins 
francese said the entire process including unloading transport 
and incineration of the wastes could take two months 
the zanoobia is the last of three freighters used to ship the 
wastes to ports in djibouti venezuela syria greece and then back 
to italy 
we could have vetoed docking of the ship in an italian port 
but it looked like an unfair decision since the waste had 
originated from italy francese said 
lawyers for tabalo shipping say two people have died possibly 
after being contaminated by the wastes a boy in venezuela died 
after playing near the cargo and a zanoobia crewman died during 
the voyage to italy from greece 
five crewmen were hospitalized last month with symptoms possibly 
caused by exposure to the wastes three others were treated and 
released monday 
dock workers walked off the job monday to protest the smell and 
fumes spreading from the zanoobia but they returned to work 
tuesday because the ship was moved to a more isolated part of the 
port 
the wastes originally were shipped from the tuscan port of 
marina di carrara in february 1987 
rizzuto said a group of italian chemical companies paid the 
milanbased company jelly wax about 40 cents a pound to dispose of 
the waste he said the company instead shipped it out of the 
country 
the first ship took it to djibouti then to venezuela where it 
was unloaded after the boy died the government ordered the wastes 
shipped out of the country 
it was loaded on a second ship bound for syria where it was 
transferred to the zanoobia that ship made one stop in greece 
before it took the wastes back to carrara

the chimes from spassky tower heralded president 
reagan on tuesday as mikhail s gorbachev led his guest onto the 
ancient cobblestones of red square stones so famous that even a 
reformer wouldnt think of repaving them 
they first turned in the direction of st basils cathedral with 
its multicolored facade and onion domes reagan gazed upward at the 
15th century cathedral as gorbachev pointed and apparently 
explained some of its features 
the square that draws millions of russian and foreign tourists 
annually had been swept clear of people save for the singlefile 
line of those waiting silently to enter the lenin mausoleum and 
eight groups of selected soviets standing by to meet reagan 
so let us welcome the president gorbachev said as he 
approached one of the groups of about 25 people who burst into 
applause with shouts of hello 
bystanders voiced concerns ranging from nuclear war to 
cooperation in space between the superpowers 
you should apply some pressure on the president you are 
always pressuring me for results gorbachev joked to the crowd 
when peace issues were broached 
the two leaders emerged from the kremlin onto the square shortly 
after the changing of the guard at lenins tomb the colorful 
ceremony is performed hourly and draws crowds of tourists even at 
midnight 
after strolling past the cathedral the redpainted spassky 
tower the contemporary marble structure where the body of vladimir 
i lenin rests and the fur trees planted along its edge reagan 
proclaimed the square beautiful 
this is our flag waving over the kremlin gorbachev proudly 
told the president 
and there he said pointing over the kremlin wall to the 
area behind the mausoleum is one of the most beautiful rooms in 
the kremlin perhaps in the world 
as they walked along the cobblestones of red square gorbachev 
remarked there should be no perestroika no rebuilding here 
gorbachev in explaining the history of area pointed toward the 
kremlin side of red square and to where he said vladimir i lenin 
had worked the leaders walked in the area of the mausoleum but 
reagan did not enter to see the embalmed body of the founder of the 
soviet state 
we want friendship between the two people reagan told 
bystanders what we have decided to do is to talk to each other 
rather than about each other and thats working 
gorbachev gently chided reagan for saying some critical 
things during their talks 
i do the same thing about america he added but i see 
that some of this is based on misconceptions about each other 
as they strolled gorbachev quoted a few russian proverbs 
adding what he called an extension to one of them 
if arguments are at the boiling point then truth 
evaporates he said so we should have dialogue 
at one point reagan seemed to think gorbachev was dwelling too 
long on past exchanges of criticism 
putting his arm around gorbachevs shoulder he said before 
this goes too far lets do something 
gorbachev reached out in one group to take a little boy into his 
arms the boy alyosha filatov peered at reagan as the general 
secretary asked do you recognize president reagan 
the little boy looked at reagan saying nothing

four murals that may be americas oldest 
wall paintings have been restored after years hidden under paint 
and varnish and go on display wednesday showing a whimsical side 
to colonial new england life 
the three walls surrounding the central stairway of portsmouths 
warner house are thought to have been painted around 1716 when the 
mansion now a national historic landmark was built for a ship 
captain 
the first scene at the foot of the stairway shows a woman 
working at a spinning wheel a standard symbol of hearth and home 
said conservationist christy cunningham who supervised the 
restoration 
but the coziness ends quickly 
next to the woman a dog barks at an eagle that has just swooped 
down to snatch a dead bleeding chicken in its claws up the 
stairs in a biblical scene abraham raises a sword over his head 
to kill his son isaac and guarding the landing are two formally 
dressed indian chiefs the king of the mohawk wolf tribe and 
prince of the rivers invited to england in 1710 to discuss an 
alliance against french colonists in canada 
only at the top of the stairs is there a gentleman on horseback 
perhaps a military officer whose red coat threecornered hat and 
white wig restore the image of stately puritanical new england 
what the 500 square feet of paintings mean who painted them and 
why the scenes were put together as they were are mysteries but 
cunningham says their theatrical qualities indicate a freer 
colonial lifestyle than is generally acknowledged 
its not what often comes to mind she said the dainty 
people their tea parties can you imagine them living with this 
stuff roaring at them every day 
this is so bold and playful its hard to understand right 
away but in fact these should help us understand better the way 
people lived its not the dainty people rustling around with 
pursed lips they were wild people they wore pink skirts and wigs 
and they were playful 
whether the murals are the oldest of their kind depends on 
whether the man on the horse is alexander macphaedris the homes 
original owner said mary black a former curator and director of 
folk art museums in new york and williamburg va she believes the 
man is macphaedris 
as far as i know they are the earliest extant interior wall 
paintings in the 13 colonies she said 
cunninghams work at warner house included stripping away damage 
by earlier restorers 
two walls had been concealed under wallpaper the most recent 
restoration attempt was in the early 1950s when a colored varnish 
was added to cover imperfections and make the paintings look 
antique she said 
cunningham and several assistants started work feb 1 they used 
techniques learned working on wall paintings from ancient rome the 
only other society that decorated ordinary homes in such a way 
after the old paint was stripped and the chipping paint 
stabilized they filled cracks with gesso an ancient mix of 
natural italian calcium carbonate and rabbitskin glue 
cunningham did not do fresh painting 
these are old paintings and theyve been through a lot and 
im not going to push them with a lot of makeup and make them look 
new she said let it be old 
the project was paid for by the nonprofit warner house 
association which raised 100000 from residents and foundations 
the home was a private residence until the 1930s when money was 
raised to buy it to prevent it from being torn down to make way for 
a gas station said margaret harrington a past president of the 
warner house association 
many colonial murals were destroyed by americans who did not 
realize their worth cunningham said 
the pompeii paintings were decorations of houses just like 
ours she noted they americans go off to europe to look at 
other peoples paintings then come home and rip out their walls

jesse jackson had the campaign trail to himself today pushing 
for the democratic presidential nomination but talking about the 
vice presidency as george bush spent the day at his maine home and 
michael dukakis worked at his statehouse office in boston 
jackson while still pressing his presidential bid in new 
jersey said that if dukakis beats him ive earned 
consideration for the no 2 spot on the partys election ticket 
he said he would give dukakis the same consideration if jackson 
wins the nomination 
dukakis who is expected to sew up the nomination in next 
tuesdays primaries in new jersey california montana and new 
mexico planned to fly to california to resume campaigning on 
wednesday 
together we must use our combined strength to change the 
course jackson said today if i put forth a vision then 
reward me 
dukakis and jackson both said over the memorial day weekend that 
jackson would play a major part in dukakis expected fall campaign 
against bush but both said the nature of that role hadnt yet been 
worked out 
bush who was meeting with economists today at kennebunkport 
maine has been taking a beating in recent public opinion surveys 
matching him against dukakis he has said reagan administration 
controversies were probably partly to blame for his showing 
he hasnt singled out attorney gen edwin meese iii as one of 
those sore points but both jackson and dukakis have criticized the 
attorney general who is under criminal investigation and have 
urged him to quit 
the vice president who has refused to call for meeses 
resignation confirmed monday that the two recently met privately 
bush declined to detail what was discussed but when asked if 
meese had promised to keep from hurting his campaign he told 
reporters yes yes i think its fair to say that 
meese in an interview on cnn on monday night said he and bush 
had talked frankly about the campaign and said he believed it 
would harm bush if he were to step down at this time 
if i were to quit now for example it would be a real 
liability because people would say there was something wrong 
said the attorney general i think its important to george bush 
as well as myself that the record be set straight 
however in the interview on the larry king live show meese 
left open the possibility that he might leave office by the end of 
the summer pressed by guest host pat buchanan a former white 
house aide as to whether he might step down by labor day meese 
responded i dont think id rule anything in or anything out 
bush says he doesnt want to comment on the meese matter until 
after an independent counsels report is issued the vice president 
says he expects that will be soon 
in any event meese said the justice department has a 
remarkable record that will be an asset to any republican running 
for office this fall 
bush was turning his attention today to economic affairs he had 
meetings scheduled with advisers including martin feldstein former 
chairman of the white house council of economic advisers 
dukakis was spending today at the statehouse in boston on 
monday he met with black supporters from around the country and 
told them that jackson would play a part in the campaign leading up 
to his expected november faceoff with bush 
i think we can put together as strong a coalition that has 
ever been put together for any presidential campaign the 
governor told reporters after the closed session 
jackson who was campaigning in new jersey said he expected to 
have a big role at the convention and in the fall but said it 
hadnt been worked out yet 
i will exercise my own options he said 
there are 466 democratic delegates at stake in next tuesdays 
primaries enough to put dukakis over the 2081 needed to 
nominate the massachusetts governor can lay claim to more than 
1700 delegates now compared with fewer than 1000 for jackson 
jackson however has his own agenda he has been using the 
final primary campaigns to push forward the ideas he wants 
incorporated into the party platform and to underline the historic 
nature of his presidential effort jackson is dukakis sole 
remaining rival for the nomination out of the eight democrats who 
declared their candidacies 
never forget this campaign jackson told supporters on 
sunday 
all three candidates made memorial day observances on monday 
the vice president gave a speech in kennebunkports town square 
after the local memorial day parade bush pointed to the superpower 
summit under way in moscow saying the arms control agreement 
eliminating intermediaterange weapons would not have been reached 
if the united states had not been strong 
jesse jackson sounded a pacifist theme as he paid tribute to 
those who died in battle 
study war no more he told a crowd as he campaigned in new 
jersey in the shadow of the statue of liberty nations must not 
rise up against nations 
dukakis attended a memorial day service in boston

a blanket of yellow sea algae that 
killed hundreds of tons of fish along the coasts of norway and 
sweden is now threatening danish fishing and tourism officials 
said tuesday 
there has been a significant drop in fish exports since the 
explosive growth of algae in danish waters in recent days said 
poul toerring director of the fish industry and export association 
dead fish were found in three locations along the coast of 
denmark since the algae spread from the southern coasts of norway 
and sweden last week toerring said in a statement tests were 
being conducted to determine whether the fish were killed by the 
algae which suffocates fish by clogging their gills 
there is nothing to indicate that the growth of algae has 
culminated said henrik sandbech deputy director of the state 
environment agency 
the agencys emergency staff is worried that the algae could 
spread even further along the coast later this week when winds are 
forecast to shift 
experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers and 
phosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramatic 
growth of the singlecell plants 
carpets of algae up to 10 feet thick have been found about 33 
feet under the surface of the water 
resort owners along the west coast of denmarks jutland 
peninsula fear news of the algae might ruin the lucrative tourist 
trade this summer 
if the algae plague gets worse in the next 14 days we risk a 
nose dive in the number of west german tourists said kurt 
larsen head of tourism in west jutland 
tourism is a 23 billion business in denmark and about 10 
percent of that amount comes from jutland 
in norway fish farmers were advised by marine biologists to 
kill their fish as a result the farmers have lost salmon sea 
trout and other domestically grown fish worth 385 million 
some fish particularly herring and flounder that swim at the 
bottom of the sea have not been as hard hit as fish cultivated in 
pens some major fish farms in western norway began towing their 
pens away from coastal areas into norways deep cool fiords to 
avoid the algae threat 
danish authorities have dispatched two marine environment 
research vessels to the skagerrak strait between denmark and norway 
and the kattegat belt between denmark and sweden to monitor the 
growth and movement of the algae 
swedish environment minister birgitta dahl called for a special 
session of the nordic council an association of icelandic 
norwegian swedish danish and finnish parliamentarians to deal 
with the algae threat in the baltic and north seas

a senior treasury department official says 
when the federal fund that insures deposits in savings institutions 
needs more money the industry not taxpayers should make the 
first contribution 
there comes a point when youre really burdening the 
industry so that its self defeating said george d gould 
undersecretary for finance but i dont think youre there yet 
in an interview recently that touched on the stock market the 
debate over new powers for banks and the condition of the nations 
savings institutions the pipepuffing former investment banker 
said it seems probable that the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp will need more money beyond the infusion provided by congress 
last august 
gould the no 3 official at treasury is the administrations 
top policymaker for banking and finance he has been mentioned as a 
likely successor to treasury secretary james a baker iii should 
baker resign as expected this summer to run the presidential 
campaign of vice president george bush 
the federal home loan bank board estimates it will cost 218 
billion to clean up the roughly 500 insolvent sampls however 
private analysts say it could cost between 50 billion and 64 
billion 
the insurance fund is expected to have only about 20 billion to 
work with over three years most of that is coming from 108 
billion in bond sales which are being paid off by a special 
assessment on the industry 
the 64 billion figure is absurd gould said but he 
conceded that 20 billion is probably not enough 
the question is when and how to provide more money 
in the debate last year the administration urged a 15 billion 
bond sale while the industry was pushing to hold it to 5 billion 
the 108 billion was a lastminute compromise 
gould said the industry could pay for another 5 billion bond 
sale although he conceded that another 15 billion probably would 
be too much 
leaders of the industrys largest trade group the us league 
of savings institutions say healthy sampls are paying all they can 
without deteriorating financially 
its a clever maneuver but its not clever enough gould 
said of the leagues position 
the new gambit that gee its too big for us to handle means 
gee the taxpayers have got to bail us out he said 
merging the fslic and the federal deposit insurance corp as a 
means of avoiding a taxpayer bailout is a bad idea gould said 
because it would damage confidence in the fdic 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich who is expected to become 
chairman of the senate banking committee next year said two weeks 
ago that sampls will be at the top of the committees list of 
priorities when congress returns after the november elections 
gould said it might help public confidence if congress began 
reexamining the problem next year but he said for now fslic has 
all it can spend without beginning to flood the market with 
foreclosed real estate 
the debate should be done in kind of a thoughtful environment 
not gee we ought to respond to a crisis because there is not a 
nearterm crisis he said 
the sampl mess was one of goulds first assignments after being 
appointed in november 1985 
through last fall and winter he led administrations push for 
the repeal of the depressionera glasssteagall act which prevents 
commercial banks from underwriting most securities 
most recently he headed an interagency working group that 
formulated the administrations policy response to the october 
stock market crash 
gould said he was cheered by the senates lopsided 942 
approval of a bill substantially repealing glasssteagall however 
he said he has been a little discouraged by the slow pace of the 
bill in the house he puts the bills chances of enactment at 5050 
regarding democratic criticism of the administrations stock 
market policy gould conceded that the working group recommended 
few changes but he said we dont think a lot of the suggested 
changes are really worth a damn 
gould said congress instead of looking for a quick fix should 
be looking at the root causes of greater market volatility such as 
the fact that more and more stock is being concentrated in the 
hands of a few professional managers of pension funds mutual funds 
and college endowments 
i dont want people to feel better if there is no reason to 
feel better because that will take their eye off looking at some 
more fundamental things maybe greater volatility is inherent 
in greater concentrations of capital he said

a small fishing boat with three people 
aboard hit a mine and exploded in the gulf of oman on tuesday 
killing one fisherman and injuring two united arab emirates 
officials said 
the official emirates news agency quoted an interior ministry 
statement as saying the incident occurred off dednah 20 miles 
south of the entrance to the strait of hormuz 
the waters are just north of a major anchorage off khor fakkan 
that is used by tankers and other commercial vessels going to and 
from the persian gulf the anchorage is the staging area for us 
navyescorted convoys of americanflagged kuwaiti tankers bound for 
kuwait 
there was no word on whether the mine was floating free or 
tethered to the floor of the gulf 
the area was plagued by a spate of mines last fall and at least 
two vessels were hit one a small offshore supply boat sank and 
six crewmen died 
the incidents which the united states and other officials 
blamed on iran prompted uae authorities to close the anchorage 
temporarily and were a factor in britain and france deciding to 
dispatch mine sweepers to the gulf region 
some of those craft eventually cleared the area and no mines 
had been reported in the gulf of oman for several months prior to 
tuesdays incident 
the ministry said all of the victims tuesday were indians the 
two survivors were rescued by another fishing boat and taken for 
treatment to fujairah another port down the coast it said 
salvage workers at fujairah were attempting to seal off leaking 
ammonia from a liberianflag norwegianowned gas tanker towed 
there after being severely damaged in an iranian gunboat attack on 
thursday 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit in london said salvage 
officials may unload the ammonia cargo lloyds officials said the 
cargo had formed a poisonous cloud around one of the dutch 
salvage tugboats that assisted the damaged vessel 
lloyds said the ship the 15530ton mundogas rio suffered 
more minor damage on monday in a blast believed caused by a 
rocketpropelled grenade that had earlier failed to explode

the threeway race for a key house democratic 
leadership post is openly moving beyond traditional shoeleather 
campaigning into the bigbucks realm of specialinterest money 
in their quest to become chairman of the democratic caucus 
reps mike synar dokla and mary rose oakar dohio are 
following the traditional path buttonholing colleagues in the 
cloakroom and visiting their offices 
but rep william gray dpa applying proven congressional 
election techniques to an inhouse contest is openly soliciting 
political action committees and washington lobbyists to support his 
candidacy 
gray chairman of the budget committee is the first person to 
openly bring active fundraising and spending into a race for a 
leadership post according to house members and veteran capitol 
hill staffers 
gray says that the money he raises will be given to democrats to 
help their campaigns for election to the house 
oakar and synar say they are running lowkey and lowbudget 
campaigns for the caucus chair which ranks just behind speaker and 
majority leader in the democratic hierarchy and is now filled by 
rep richard gephardt dmo 
im not raising money for my caucus chair race says oakar 
ive been going to house members just like i go door to door 
at home i dont think winning the job or any office in the 
house is dependent on how much money we pass out 
we are running on our own merits synar says the major 
expense for us will be coffee and donuts 
it is not unusual for representatives and senators seeking 
leadership jobs to make contributions to the political campaigns of 
colleagues either from their own campaign funds or from their own 
leadership pacs 
but until now all of them including gray have insisted that 
their giving had nothing to do with their leadership candidacies 
critics say the tactic amounts to attempted votebuying 
in february gray hosted a dinner for house democrats from 
pennsylvania who each got a 1000 campaign contribution just for 
showing up gray said he wanted to share his money because he was 
facing no serious challenge to his reelection to the house this 
year jon plebani his administrative assistant said the dinner 
was unrelated to the caucus chair race 
since 1983 gray has given out at least 72400 to democratic 
incumbents and challengers according to the washington newsletter 
campaign industry news 
despite the earlier denials gray cited the caucus chair 
campaign in at least two recent mailings sent out under the 
letterhead of the committee for democratic opportunity the 
political action committee he formed last december 
i need your active help he said in a may 3 letter i need 
to raise funds to pursue this new challenge i would appreciate 
your sending me a check for 500 to 1000 so that i can begin to 
build the active support within the democratic members of congress 
to win this key leadership position 
former rep bob edgar dpa now a special assistant to gray 
said the letters were sent to about 25 to 30 pennsylvanians who had 
given to edgars election campaigns 
asked how much money he needed for the caucus race and how he 
planned to spend it gray replied the pac is designed to help 
support good democratic candidates running for congress support of 
those candidates is not dependent on whether they support me for 
caucus chair 
in another mailing in may gray cited the caucus contest to 
people he invited to a breakfast at a restaurant near the capitol 
the letter made no specific appeal for money but it said anyone 
wanting to help gray could contact plebani 
plebani and gray spokesman neil strawser did not return phone 
calls seeking to identify the recipients of this letter at least 
one washington lobbyist received one 
the open solicitation of money for an inhouse election comes as 
some lawmakers are trying to put brakes on the escalating cost of 
getting elected to congress itself 
senate democrats trying to enact spending limits have been 
blocked by republican filibusters in the house a group headed by 
rep al swift dwash is ready to start moving a bill once the 
senate passes one 
swifts legislation would ban the type of leadership pacs 
established by gray and others

most western european newspapers tuesday applauded 
president reagan for putting the stress on human rights at his 
summit with mikhail s gorbachev in moscow 
a french official said reagans stance would help gorbachev in 
his efforts to reform the country 
hubert vedrine president francois mitterrands spokesman said 
in a radio interview that when reagan speaks of human rights 
gorbachev knows it in a certain way expects it and even 
benefits from it because thats part of the evolution he wants for 
his country 
no official comment was reported from other european capitals 
but many newspapers devoted editorials to analyzing reagans 
speeches and actions in moscow concerning religious freedom and 
human rights most of them gave him high marks 
reagan has used his first visit to moscow and the new 
opportunities of glasnost to take the message of the west to the 
soviet citadel the citadel has not been stormed but neither is it 
unscathed commented the conservative times of london adding 
president reagan showed in his forthright american way 
that he probably understands the needs of russians as people and 
individuals as well as mr gorbachev does unlike mr gorbachev 
however he has the freedom to put his inner thoughts into words 
and talk about the spiritual dimension 
however londons leftleaning guardian was skeptical saying 
the human right he reagan seemed at root most concerned about 
was the right of the soviet people to throw out the communist party 
mr gorbachev it is to be hoped will still be smiling on and 
after thursday but if he isnt the formidable pack of white house 
advisers should pause and ask themselves which humans seeking 
rights were truly helped by the street theater in moscow this 
monday 
the guardian also seized on reagans statement that human rights 
were fundamental to us relationships with all nations asking 
whether this applied to pakistan guatemala south africa and iraq 
in bonn the respected conservative paper die welt dismissed the 
argument that reagan had meddled in soviet internal matters 
it said reagan did not tell the soviets how they should live 
he told them that all human beings should have the freedom to live 
he does not believe a nation which denies its own citizens 
basic human rights deserves the trust of other nations 
the independent belgian daily het belang van limburg voiced 
understanding for gorbachevs predicament 
a dictatorship which itself is in the midst of reforms is 
very unstable and in a supercentralized multiethnic nation such 
as the soviet union such an operation is doubly dangerous it 
said 
gorbachev balances on a high wire suspended on one end on 
the good old days and on the other on a breakup of the soviet 
state 
in italy franco venturini wrote in milans conservative daily 
corriere della sera the message reagan is bearing into the 
wolfs lair is that coexistence must have a moral dimension and 
that the search for disarmament is inseparable from the reduction 
in ideological contrasts 
he said that if a crack appears in the wall of prohibitions 
that bears upon the soviet citizens reagan will share part of the 
credit 
sandro viola of romes leftleaning la repubblica italys 
largest daily commented that reagan took up human rights because 
he realized that putting pressure on the russians at this time 
could lead them to concede what they would have never conceded a 
number of years ago

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has cast 
himself in the summits lead role projecting a vital image as 
statesman negotiator and presidential tour guide and giving 
impromptu interviews to reporters 
on the eve of the first press conference by a communist party 
chief on home turf gorbachev on tuesday sped through an ambitious 
summit itinerary prolonging a oneonone session with president 
reagan sporting him around red squares landmarks and overseeing 
the signing of arms control protocols all before noon 
he bantered with reporters before his talks with the president 
in the morning insisting that it was time to bang our fists on 
the table to get negotiators moving on a strategic arms reduction 
treaty 
showing reagan around red square gorbachev introduced the 
president to groups of soviets clustered at one end of the 
cobblestone expanse and pointed out famed sights like soviet 
founder vladimir i lenins red marble mausoleum and st basils 
cathedral 
stealing the limelight from the man known as the great 
communicator gorbachev gingerly took a little boy into his arms 
and motioned to reagan to get acquainted with the young soviet 
while cameras whirred and captured the kremlin chief in a congenial 
pose 
later at an unscheduled stop in cathedral square gorbachev 
shook hands with soviet and american tourists and gave an impromptu 
interview to cbs news anchorman dan rather whose crew was filming 
nearby 
at the signing ceremony gorbachev entered the red salon of the 
grand kremlin palace with a wave and a greeting for journalists 
after the session he returned to an associated press reporter who 
had asked a question during his entrance 
what was it you wanted to ask he said the party chief then 
recapped his morning meeting with reagan saying it was spent 
tackling economic problems and barriers to broader cultural ties 
i criticized the position of the president and congress for 
having thrown up a great deal of logjams in the way of healthy 
economic cooperation he said adding that reagan had agreed with 
him that improvements are in order 
reagan who is 20 years gorbachevs senior appeared fatigued on 
the third day of his meetings with gorbachev and declined to answer 
questions about the results of his talks white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said the president had slept fitfully and was 
tiring like the rest of his staff 
in the afternoon reagan met with soviet writers addressed 
students and faculty members at moscow state university and 
presided over a state dinner in honor of the gorbachevs at spaso 
house the us ambassadors residence 
but during the events that pit the two leaders together 
gorbachev has emerged as the more vibrant figure that image 
combined with any specific achievements that could come out of the 
summit could propel him into a more secure position going into an 
important party gathering on june 28 
soviet government spokesman gennady i gerasimov commented last 
week that gorbachev would have to divide his time during the summit 
between the affairs of state and the pressures of an approaching 
party conference that will pass judgment on perestroika 
gorbachevs reform program 
the conference could prove explosive as some of the 5000 
delegates are believed to share kremlin ideology chief yegor k 
ligachevs view that changes are being introduced too quickly 
hosting the reagans at broadly publicized events like monday 
nights state dinner and showing them around a sprucedup soviet 
capital has apparently impressed the populace and strenthened their 
pride in their nation 
the 57yearold gorbachev has been more accessible to western 
reporters than reagan and the soviet assessment of how the summit 
is progressing trickles out through a battery of soviet briefings 
for the thousands of reporters covering reagans visit 
the usually bureaucratic soviet business world has taken a cue 
from the leader showing unusual attentiveness to the needs of the 
press and officials the tass news agency published the state 
dinner menu in english and has distributed unusually detailed 
historical reports on summit venues like st catherines hall and 
spaso house managers of the international hotel housing the summit 
press center have made rounds of some offices to ensure that the 
airconditioning works and that waste baskets are emptied 
as part of the public relations drive gorbachev planned to give 
a press conference at the foreign ministry press center on 
wednesday afternoon the firstever event here that approximates a 
us presidential press conference 
he has met with reporters during his three previous summits with 
reagan in geneva reykjavik iceland and washington and during 
visits to other major countries 
gorbachev bristled at a question about soviet political 
prisoners during his first full news conference in geneva but has 
since shown himself to be adept at handling the range of queries 
thrown out to him by western reporters 
his first session in moscow will give him a chance to set out 
his views of how the summit turned out and to portray himself as a 
victor on the foreign affairs front as he heads toward the domestic 
debate of the party conference

two prominent soviet political commentators on 
tuesday disputed former moscow communist party boss boris n 
yeltsins claim that the kremlins no 2 official is blocking 
economic and social reforms 
yeltsin in an unprecedented public airing of highlevel kremlin 
disagreement told the british broadcasting corp in a television 
interview monday that yegor k ligachev should resign 
feodor burlatsky a former member of the partys policymaking 
central committee who writes for the weekly literaturnaya gazeta 
said ligachev would face severe punishment if he were a true 
opponent of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
if ligachev has his own views it is only natural it is 
another thing to lead some conservatives and i think this is not a 
fact i dont think that anybody leads some opposition it is 
just impossible in our political system if such a person appears 
on the political scene he would be out of the leadership 
burlatsky told reporters 
alexei arbatov deputy director of the institute for 
international economy and international relations said he 
disagreed with yeltsin that ligachev is blocking reform i also 
can express my opinion and i do not agree with mr yeltsin those 
opinions are those of mr yeltsin arbatov said in an interview 
the 67yearold ligachev who oversees communist party ideology 
has indicated in speeches he feels gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or open discussion of the countrys problems has 
gone too far in denouncing most of the economic and social policies 
of the past 
yeltsin said in the interview that ligachev should go because 
the party is still lagging behind because the process of 
democratization in the party is not developingand comrade 
ligachev is the main person responsible for this 
arbatovs father georgy a central committee member who heads 
the institute for the study of the usa and canada took issue 
with yeltsin on another point his decision to give the interview 
to the bbc as well as one to cbs news 
in our point of view i dont think it was too correct for him 
to do it but that is my personal opinion he told a news 
conference 
yeltsin 57 was removed feb 18 as a candidate or nonvoting 
member of the ruling politburo his problems began when he made a 
speech to the central committee on oct 21 1987 in which he said 
gorbachevs reforms were going to slowly and attacked ligachev 
on nov 11 the moscow communist party committee had fired 
yeltsin 
at the time gorbachev accused yeltsin of using immature words 
and of radical actions and said he placed his personal ambitions 
above the interests of the party 
removed from the politburo he was named to the cabinetlevel 
position of deputy head of the state construction committee he 
lost his job on the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys 
nominal legislature on may 4 
as moscow party boss yeltsin stood out for his brusque 
aggressive manner and populist style he was popular among 
muscovites for criticizing consumer shortages and sometimes 
striding into stores to take his complaints straight to shopkeepers 
rumors circulated in moscow in midapril that ligachev and 
gorbachev had a bitter faceoff with ligachev reportedly backing a 
newspaper article defending the late dictator josef v stalin and 
gorbachev supposedly counterattacking through another article 
pushing radical reforms 
the two have made several public appearances together since 
then with no obvious sign of disagreements

georgia enshrined the tiger swallowtail and utah embraced the 
allosaurus but no such warm welcome awaited the banana slug in 
california or the monarch butterfly in west virginia 
the fate of these and other creatures was debated in 
legislatures across the nation this year part of the timehonored 
custom of naming official state symbols for everything from fish to 
fossils from mollusks to muffins 
critics say the practice wastes time and holds lawmakers up to 
ridicule but defenders say it can help get young people involved 
in the political process boost tourism and provide some 
beneficial comic relief 
it gets so tense in there sometimes its just too much 
said rep mary vanderlinde in south dakota where this years 
legislature designated the triceratops a planteating dinosaur as 
the state fossil and black hills gold as the state jewelry 
this livens it up and then people will relax and get back to 
work she said 
after the gold measure was passed by the house in january 
lawmakers adopted a second resolution naming vanderlinde the 
states official jewel because she takes gold shots for arthritis 
idaho adopted a fossil this year the hagerman horse fossil a 
3millionyearold relic found in southern idahos magic valley 
state and local officials are trying to turn the fossil beds south 
of interstate 84 into a tourist attraction to boost the economy 
the florida house voted in april to name the key lime pie the 
official state pie inspired by a legislative report that 
recommended the honor as an excellent way to promote a genuine 
florida product since the pie can only be properly made with key 
limes from florida 
however the measure ran into trouble in the senate where rules 
chairman dempsey barron favors sweet potato pie more common to the 
panhandle 
on thursday the california senate nearly squashed a measure to 
name the banana slug the official mollusk but narrowly decided to 
allow the proposal to be reconsidered in the future 
these things are replusive i mean look at them the joke 
has to stop here said sen john doolittle as banana slugs oozed 
around inside a glass terrarium on a cart parked on the floor of 
the upper house 
in some other actions so far this year georgia designated the 
tiger swallowtail the state butterfly but the west virginia house 
refused to act on a senate measure naming the monarch butterfly the 
state insect utah made the allosaurus the state fossil and 
hawaiis legislature approved making the nene a native goose the 
state bird and the hibiscus the state flower 
last month in pennsylvania a house committee named a 
longextinct aquatic creature phacops rana the state fossil 
after 100 bucks county schoolchildren trooped into the committee 
room and performed skits and gave speeches supporting the 
appellation 
at one point the committee chairman rep camille george 
donned a scarf and sunglasses and held an umbrella to show the 
children how fossils are formed over millions of years 
theres certainly some time consumed in this but if youre 
involving a bunch of youngsters in the process maybe theres 
nothing wrong with it said stephen macnett chief counsel for 
senate republicans i guess it depends on how long it takes and 
when on the legislative agenda it occurs 
that attitude was not encouraged this year in indiana where 
house speaker paul s mannweiler and senate president pro tem 
robert d garton warned lawmakers not to introduce frivolous bills 
for the biennial short session 
it creates the wrong image for the legislature said garton 
its a frivolous image it creates the image that thats all we 
do and it detracts from the serious business 
elaine knapp editor with the council of state governments in 
lexington ky defended the practice of naming symbols 
its not something that takes up a great deal of attention or 
time she said i dont think anybody expects every minute to 
be taken up with something serious maybe its more harmless than 
raising taxes

newhome sales climbed 4 percent in april to 
the highest level in a year the government said tuesday but 
analysts said rising interest rates would likely dampen sales this 
summer 
new singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 679000 last month the fastest pace since new homes sold 
at a rate of 728000 in april 1987 the commerce and housing and 
urban development departments said in a joint report 
it was the third consecutive increase coming atop a 12 percent 
rise in march and an 114 percent jump in february 
overall its a very nice report no question about it said 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of home 
builders a survey of home builders showed sales remained strong in 
early may he said 
but clearly our concern is whats been going on with interest 
rates seiders said if rates move much higher certainly 
sales are going to be coming down our forecast is for sales 
activity to peak in the second quarter 
rates on 30year fixedrate conventional mortgages have been 
climbing steadily since late march averaging 1058 percent last 
week up from the low this year of 984 percent according to the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
warren lasko executive vice president of the mortgage bankers 
association of america said sales could be helped in may by 
purchasers hoping to beat out further increases 
but by june the bloom will be off the rose and were going 
see sales trailing off he said 
however james christian chief economist of the us league of 
savings institutions said higher rates rather than chasing buyers 
from the market may simply cause them to switch to adjustable rate 
mortgages 
weve proved over and over again that adjustable rate 
mortgages provide a reasonable alternative to fixed rates even 
though both rates are moving up you still have adjustables in what 
has to be considered very affordable ranges he said 
more worrisome christian said is the increase in new home 
prices the median or midpoint price of a new home was 110500 
in april up 33 percent from march and 145 percent from a year 
ago 
the average price of a new home was 137000 up 42 percent 
from march and 16 percent over the past year 
the recent increases in sales followed declines in the three 
previous months 12 percent in january 62 percent in december 
and 43 percent in november economists attributed them to buyers 
uncertainty following the october stock market crash 
sales for the first four months of this year are 93 percent 
below the same period of 1987 when mortgage interest rates hit 
nineyear lows 
there were 671000 new homes sold in 1987 and 750000 sold in 
1986 a record analysts are predicting sales in the 
620000650000 range this year 
sales increased in all regions of the country in april they 
were up 59 percent in the midwest 55 percent in the west 29 
percent in the south and 28 percent in the northeast 
in a report last week the national association of realtors said 
sales of existing homes increased 45 percent in april after 
increases of 25 percent in both march and february

americans are broadly dissatisfied with the 
presidential nominating system with majorities backing major 
changes such as eliminating party conventions a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
six in 10 respondents in the national survey said they have not 
followed the campaign regularly only half said the races provide a 
good discussion of the issues and sizable minorities said the best 
candidates generally lose 
as the primary season winds down with the final contests to be 
held june 7 the survey of 1204 adults found unhappiness with the 
process that spanned ideolgies and political affiliations 
fiftytwo percent of those polled favored major changes in the 
way the parties pick candidates while only 38 percent said the 
system works well enough as it is ten percent said they didnt 
know 
there was a striking split among age groups the youngest 
1829 thought by a narrow margin that the system works well enough 
as it is while the oldest over 64 favored major changes by a 
wide 5628 percent spread 
similarly attentiveness to the races was divided by age with 
just 27 percent of the youngest group saying they followed this 
years primaries regularly compared with 54 percent of the oldest 
group overall 41 percent of the respondents said they followed 
the campaign regularly 
just 31 percent favored the current nominating system rules 
vary by state but generally voters select some delegates the 
party selects others and the delegates meet to choose the nominee 
at party conventions where under some circumstances delegates can 
switch allegiance 
a majority in the poll 59 percent said they would prefer to 
have voters select the nominees without any delegates at party 
conventions the smallest share a scant 3 percent liked the idea 
of letting party leaders make the selection on their own 
disfavor with the system also was reflected by the sizable 
minorities of americans who said the parties particularly 
democrats generally do not nominate their best candidate from 
among those running 
while 46 percent of respondents said the democrats generally do 
pick their best candidate 40 percent said not a majority of women 
said the best is nominated but a plurality of men 47 percent to 
41 percent said not 
more respondents overall 52 percent said the republicans 
nominate their best candidate from among those running but more 
than a third said not

republicans with theirs but even the democratic respondents said 
the republicans make their best choice 5138 while republicans 
were split on whether the democrats make their best pick 42 
percent saying yes and 44 percent no 
independents said the republicans choose well 4835 but also 
were split on the democrats 
when it comes to choosing vice presidential candidates a large 
marjority favored leaving the choice to the presidential nominee 
while less than a quarter said the secondplace finisher should be 
the running mate 
while 51 percent said the nomination campaigns usually provide a 
good discussion of the issues 40 percent disagreed and college 
graduates and higherincome americans were split on the question 
in what may be a reflection of jesse jacksons efforts as a 
candidate for the democratic nomination a greater share of blacks 
64 percent said the campaigns provide a good discussion of the 
issues also 55 percent of southerners said the campaigns provide 
a good discussion belying criticism of the super tuesday regional 
primary as a superficial media event 
a plurality of all respondents and a majority of southerners 
said super tuesday was a good idea and 54 percent of the 
respondents said regional primaries should be held in the future

elsie frum remembers running uphill from 
the johnstown flood of 1889 which swept everything in its path 
killing 2200 people in one of the nations worst natural disasters 
it was just like a roar there were millions of gallons of 
water you know mrs frum 105 said tuesday it came just 
like a tidal wave and then it was over everything was washed away 
we ran if we didnt run i wouldnt be here today 
mrs frum was 6 when the south fork dam burst and a 40foot wall 
of water and debris slammed into this western pennsylvania steel 
and railroad city 12 miles downstream 
she and frank shomo 99 of robinson are the two remaining 
survivors of the may 31 1889 disaster they were to be guests of 
honor at the annual flood survivors banquet on tuesday night 
the dam held back lake conemaugh and was owned by the south fork 
fishing and hunting club a summer playground for wealthy 
industrialists led by andrew carnegie and henry clay frick 
after several days of rain the poorly maintained dam was 
breached and finally burst unleashing a torrent of water that 
cleared the conemaugh river valley of houses bridges and trains 
before it hit johnstown 
pushing ahead uprooted trees splintered beams dead and dying 
people and farm animals and miles of wire from a destroyed steel 
mill the watery mass crashed into a pennsylvania railroad bridge 
just below johnstown where it piled up to form a temporary second 
dam that soon caught fire many bodies never were found 
when she was a child mrs frums family lived in nearby 
conemaugh as the water approached her father grabbed his wife and 
three daughters and started them running up a hill the floodwater 
passed below 
it happened and then it was over mrs frum recalled 
after that it was calm like nothing happened 
shomo only 100 days old when the dam burst lived about 20 
miles downriver from johnstown at lockport he said the high water 
did not reach his house 
mrs frum survived another flood in 1936 stranded on the second 
floor of her johnstown house by the areas third flood disaster 
in 1977 mrs frum was living high and dry on a mountain in nearby

officials fired a rocket motor from a pershing 2 
missile on the high plains east of denver on tuesday hoping to 
determine whether hundreds of the motors can be safely destroyed as 
required by a new ussoviet treaty 
the burn following 11 days of delays because of bad weather 
came on the final day open for such test firings under the 
ussovrange nuclear forces treaty 
from our initial indication the burn the static firing was 
conducted just as we had planned and the plume the exhaust cloud 
traveled with the wind over the 50 monitoring sites said 
pueblo army depot actiiet intermediatevity spokeswoman mary wilson 
the colorado department of health monitors will analyze the 
exhaust to see whether such firings would pose any threat to the 
environment 
about 20 reporters and photographers witnessed the 58second 
test at 636 am at the depot 15 miles east of denver officials 
said 
there was a steady bright white light from the end of the 
rocket nozzle extending approximately 7580 feet wilson said 
the weapons treaty was ratified last week by the senate and 
copies were scheduled to be exchanged wednesday at the summit 
meeting in moscow between soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
president reagan 
the treaty requires that the armys 420 pershing missiles be 
destroyednal park service superintendents were invited to 
attend the fourday gathering in grand teton national park 
the meeting the first of its kind in 12 years was called by 
park service director william penn mott in early 1987 but he left 
most of the planning and agenda to a committee of superintendents 
the program was turned over entirely to the superintendents 
and they chose subject matter which focuses on current issues both 
internal and external facing the parks today said george 
berklacy chief of public affairs for the park service this is 
not a regional or headquarters agenda this conference is by and 
for the superintendents 
t destry jarvis vice president of the national parks and 
conservation association a washington dcbased nonprofit 
citizens group praised the park service for holding the 
superintendents conclave 
i think it is a very serious professional thing that they 
have done said jarvis who planned to attend as an observer i 
think its very important that the national park service enhance 
the notion that this is a single service with a single purpose 
im sure they will get a lot of business done that would not occur 
if they werent together 
steve whitney of the wilderness society said the meeting is in 
the best interest of the country they the superintendents 
shouldnt wait another decade for another one 
last week the wilderness society issued a report calling on the 
federal government to move all hotels and other concessions out of 
the national parks and describing some parks as endangered 
the wilderness societys assessment was just the latest in a 
continuing controversy over whats best for americas officially 
preserved natural heritage 
the national parks and conservation association recently issued 
a report recommending a 50 million annual increase in the park 
services budget just to fix a resource management backlog of 
problems 
in 1980 the national park service itself issued a report to 
congress on the state of the parks in that summary more than 
4000 individual threats were identified 
a recent general accounting office survey concluded the park 
service had an unmet need of 19 billion for maintenance and 
capital improvements in the 1987 fiscal year 
because of advanced continuing deterioration some of these 
assets may be lost permanently said the gao study 
the national park system includes 49 fullfledged national parks 
and 292 other units including national recreation areas and 
national seashore areas encompassing a total of 77 million acres

a program used in some areas to hatch 
endangered sea turtles is turning out too many males and must be 
changed naturalists say 
from may to november loggerhead and green sea turtles lay eggs 
on the beach and abandon them eggs buried in cooler sand hatch as 
males and in warmer as females said j alan huff who heads the 
state department of natural resources turtle protection program 
but some of those nests are dug up by scientists and hatched in 
incubators to gurarantee a higher survival rate 
until recently eggs gathered up in the john u lloyd state 
recreation area here and in some other locations around florida 
have been incubated in styrofoam chests young turtles do not show 
their gender externally however and scientists were unsure how 
many hatchlings were male 
but a study of 1986 hatchlings which involved a painstaking 
surgical procedure has confirmed what some had suspected most of 
the turtles from the chests are male 
to solve the problem the naturalists are switching to burial of 
the turtles in beach sand but with a cage surrounding them to ward 
off predators as some other south florida hatcheries do the cages 
are placed near the shore to make the hatchlings run from their 
nest to the sea as short as possible 
we dont know all the implications and are just being 
conservative and encouraging people to use beach hatcheries 
whenever possible said huff incubating the eggs in boxes will 
now be the choice of last resort he said 
the unbalanced sex ratio is not considered serious yet because 
only about 10 percent of the turtle nests are dug up and incubated 
artificially he said 
we take so few compared to the worldwide population its 
unlikely wed ever affect the wild population he said but the 
aim of the turtle program is to simulate nature as nearly as 
possible he added

police seized a shirtless man who climbed atop a 
zoo exhibit where a worker was mauled to death last month thumped 
his chest and traded growls with two agitated bengal tigers 
the incident which occurred before about 100 memorial day 
spectators came a day after two of the zoos 15 tigers were 
returned to view for the first time since the may 12 mauling of 
keeper ricardo tovar 
robert lavoie 27 was charged with criminal trespass and jailed 
in lieu of a 1000 bond police said tuesday he was not injured 
he was making a tarzan call down to the tigers he was really 
aggravating the animals said witness larry spaetgens who 
videotaped the incident i thought he was going to fall i sent 
my wife away 
the episode underscored recent employee complaints about lax 
safety lavoie apparently gained access to a walkway over the tiger 
display through a fallen unmarked gate while a guard was at lunch 
zoo officials who ordered an investigation of safety procedures 
after tovars death said mondays incident is not indicative of 
lax procedures 
there is no way we can protect anyone from their own 
irrational acts said zoo curator nelson herwig 
but zoo employees have complained that the zoos design and 
management put them and the public in jeopardy chief among their 
concerns is working alone with dangerous animals because of 
staffing shortages 
moments before lavoie appeared atop the 12inchwide wall behind 
the rocks he was lingering outside the fallen gate the gate was 
erected as a temporary measure about two years ago herwig said 
the walkway was intended as an overview for the cat 
facility he said it was never opened because it would be 
impossible to prevent an incident such as this 
he said he did not know how long the gate was broken but zoo 
director john werler said lavoie was the first unauthorized person 
to have gone past the barrier and into the exhibit

critics are praising the adventurous 
spirit of this years spoleto festival usa of the performing 
arts even if some productions havent emerged unscathed from 
reviewers pens 
the washington post said spoleto has often been daring but 
this year seems to be more so than usual 
everywhere at this years festival there is something 
beguiling and new or so ancient its just as challenging said 
usa today 
the main opera at the festival which continues through sunday is 
dvoraks rusalka a work which is rarely performed in this 
country 
spoleto also features the seldomperformed montezuma by carl 
heinrich graun and saw the premiere of a controversial 
dancertheater piece by new york choreographer martha clarke 
the post called the spoleto production of rusalka one of 
the most effective in the festivals 12year american history 
but the new york times said the staging and special effects are 
the real highlights of the opera based on a czechoslovakian fairy 
tale about a water sprite 
though the singers involved were mostly good secondand 
thirdlevel professionals the principal strengths of this staging 
at least for two of the three acts were visual the times 
reviewer said striking stage pictures came and went 
compensating to an extent for a lack of vocal excitement 
the state said the production is not to be missed by 
operalovers spoletos staging may be the only opportunity to see 
this sadly neglected opera in a lifetime the columbia newspaper 
said 
montezuma which tells of the spanish destruction of the 
aztec civilization in the 1500s is performed even less frequently 
and hasnt fared well with the spoleto critics 
the news and courier of charleston called the cast spotty 
and suggested it is not an opera for all to enjoy 
it did manage to give a taste of montezuma however albeit 
with a merely serviceable abstract decor and conducting and singing 
that was mostly insensitive and inauthentic to the period wrote 
the wall street journal 
usa today called ms clarkes miracolo damore a delicious 
little scandal for the festival 
the work which conjures sometimes violent images of love 
features some nudity and has caused a stir among spoleto audiences 
a number of people have walked out of the historic dock street 
theater before the end of the performances 
viewed with a calm receptive eye miracolo damore is a 
profoundly impressive tight lucid piece said usa today 
the naked women evoke botticelli and the lyrics and minuscule 
amount of text are all in italian making for a rather remote 
experience if you dont get the references the wall street 
journal said its either a dream or a bore depending on whom 
you ask 
one reviewer for the news and courier called the work 
unsettling and described it as a hateful piece bitter and 
malevolent as a theater work its visually beautiful but then so 
is a coral snake 
another reviewer for the paper suggested this is clearly a 
work of dare i say it feminist revenge 
the reviewer added ms clarke has wrought a theatrical 
experience that will affect different people in radically one 
might say almost violently different ways 
composer gian carlo menotti founded the festival of the two 
worlds in spoleto italy in 1958 and later founded the spoleto 
festival usa in charleston and the spoleto festival of the three 
worlds in melbourne australia he still heads all of them

the solidarity trade union federation 
announced tuesday it is boycotting nationwide elections june 19 for 
local and provincial councils 
the boycott will be an expression of our resistance to the 
deprivation of our rights it will be an expression on striving for 
regaining of social sovereignty solidaritys national executive 
commission said in a communique released by spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz 
government spokesman jerzy urban said earlier that the 
government was prepared for opponents to mount a boycott 
the vote will be the first held under a new election law that 
requires at least two candidates for each seat secret ballots and 
allows various social groups to propose candidates 
but the ballot continues to be structured in such a way that 
polands communist party is guaranteed a majority of the seats on 
the municipal and provincial councils 
for most seats only communist party candidates are nominated 
allied political parties and independents are also allotted a 
certain number of seats fixed beforehand by nominating commissions 
urban defended the arrangement at his weekly news conference 
tuesday saying the public will be able to show its preference for 
individuals although not for parties 
but the statement by the outlawed solidarity movement said any 
hopes that poles would be able to elect candidates freely and 
democratically were in vain 
instead of returning to us our rights we were offered 
participation in a show disguising the old practice in which it 
is decided for the citizens who can represent them solidarity 
said 
solidarity initially had discussed trying to nominate candidates 
for the council elections the first to be held in poland since 
1984 
but the electoral law passed march 10 said only legal groups 
could propose candidates and it left the final ballot composition 
in the hands of the electoral commissions dominated by the party 
this electoral procedure gives us no chances in practice 
said warsaw regional solidarity leader zbygniew bujak 
but urban said many representatives of independent communities 
were proposed to be candidates and most of them refused because 
as they stated the electoral procedure wasnt democratic enough 
for them 
he called it a vicious circle they want more democracy 
but dont want to take advantage of existing possibilities 
urban also said the government does not fear a boycott and would 
not as in the past interpret the eventual turnout figures as a 
barometer of public support for the government 
experience shows that these boycotts have minimal effect on 
electoral attendance he said 
in polands last nationwide election the nov 29 referendum on 
government plans for economic and political reform 673 percent of 
the 262 million eligible voters participated it was the lowest 
announced turnout of any election in polands postwar history 
both referendum questions were approved by a majority of votes 
cast but the low turnout prevented them from receiving approval by 
more than half all eligible voters as required by law for the 
results to be legally binding

wr grace amp co which two years ago paid a 
reported 8 million for polluting wells in woburn pleaded guilty 
tuesday to lying about the amount of a chemical it used at a plant 
there 
us district court judge joseph l tauro fined the new 
yorkbased conglomerate the maximum 10000 for willfully 
misleading the environmental protection agency about purchases of 
the cleaning solvent acetone 
as part of an agreement the government dropped a second charge 
that wr grace concealed dumping of hazardous waste in the ground 
behind the plant in woburn where a group of families alleges that 
chemically tainted water caused six cancer deaths 
i view this to be intolerable corporate behavior and the kind 
of behavior we will continue to pursue with the criminal remedies 
available to us epa regional administrator michael r deland 
said after the plea 
deland said the epa plans to require grace to clean all 
contaminants at the woburn plant under the federal superfund 
cleanup act 
in a separate civil suit filed by eight woburn familes a 
federal jury in september 1986 found wr grace liable for 
polluting two town wells the case was settled for a reported 8 
million before a second trial could be held on whether the 
contamination caused the six leukemia deaths in the town about 15 
miles northwest of boston 
in a twocount indictment in january 1987 wr grace was 
accused of lying to the government about chemicals it used at the 
cryovac plant near the wells which were shut in 1979 
the company asserted in a february 1982 letter to the epa it had 
bought only one fivegallon drum of acetone in 1978 for the plant 
the company said the acetone purchased was the only amount brought 
to woburn in 22 years covered by an epa inquiry 
assistant us attorney tobin harvey told tauro that from 1973 
to 1976 wr grace had bought 65 gallons of acetone and had used 
the solvent repeatedly in the 1960s and 1970s to clean paint spray 
guns and circuit boards at cryovac a food packaging machine shop 
wr grace attorney robert popeo told the judge that no company 
officials were aware the reports to epa were inaccurate 
while the company does not dispute that the statement was 
inaccurate it vigorously disputes that it was intentionally so 
wr grace said in a statement 
acting us attorney robert s mueller said the maximum fine for 
a corporation filing false statements with the government was 
increased to 500000 in 1984 grace was levied the old fine 
because the crime was committed in 1982 
eight families filed suit in 1982 charging four parties with 
causing the hazardous waste contamination of the wells they are 
wr grace beatrice foods co the john j riley tannery and 
unifirst a uniform supply company 
unifirst settled for 1 million in october 1985 before the 
original trial and wr grace settled halfway through the 1986 
proceedings 
us district court judge walter jay skinner dismissed the 
portion of the suit against beatrice and the tannery and in january 
denied the families a new trial they have appealed to the 1st us 
circit court of appeals

defense minister yitzhak rabin said tuesday he 
has met with palestinians in search of ways to end violence in the 
occupied lands but arabs involved said he had nothing to offer and 
that the rebellion will continue 
the army said 207 palestinians have been killed since riots 
began dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians of the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip it is the first time army figures have 
exceeded those kept by the united nations which put the death toll 
at 198 
according to the army soldiers shot 157 arabs to death the 
army said the rest died of other causes or that the circumstances 
of their deaths were being investigated an israeli soldier and a 
jewish settler also have been killed 
dedi zucker a leftwing member of parliament quoted a 
confidential government document as saying 5133 palestinians had 
been shot or injured 
he quoted the document as saying that 10000 arabs were in jail 
and that half of them had been arrested before dec 8 he said one 
in every 80 residents of the occupied lands over age 16 was in 
custody 
zucker said a highranking defense official blamed harassment 
and maltreatment by soldiers of palestinians for continued unrest 
in the lands that israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
war he said the official whom he would not identify further 
commented in a meeting with a few legislators 
the army said a soldier was convicted of manslaughter in the 
killing of an arab and a palestinian human rights group demanded 
that israel close a new prison where arab inmates were held in 
inhumane and illegal conditions 
rabin said on israel radio that he decided to meet with arabs 
including palestine liberation organiation supporters because he 
was convinced palestinians now realized that by stones and 
firebombs they can achieve nothing 
he held two meetings in less than a week including one on 
monday but had said nothing previously about their purpose 
earlier this year rabin said he would talk with palestinians 
only after the violence stopped analysts said the meetings 
indicate rabin believes the rebellion is abating 
im the one who represents the israeli government to the 
population in the territories and i think the time has come to 
talk with all sections with all factions among the palestinians 
rabin said tuesday i intend to continue meeting with people who 
represent different points of view 
arabs who attended the meeting monday said rabin offered nothing 
but frustration to people involved in the 6monthold 
intefadeh which means uprising in arabic 
yassir obeid a physician from ramallah in the west bank the 
defense minister told them the us peace initiative had failed and 
arabs could expect no political movement before next june 
rabin did not say what he told the palestinians and his office 
merely confirmed the meeting took place 
he told us the shultz plan has missed the train and the moscow 
summit will be fruitless obeid said in an interview we are 
too small for the superpowers they are too involved with important 
things 
rabin also told the group another diplomatic initiative could 
not begin until months after the united states and israel hold 
elections in november he said 
it was very frustrating obeid said this just means the 
intefadeh will be more prolonged and the people will have to suffer 
longer 
the intefadeh is far from over or waning the palestinians 
wont stop the violence without realizing some political 
aspirations this is what we told rabin the people who are running 
things are willing to pay a lot of sacrifices 
hanna nasser a bethlehem businessman said the arabs gave rabin 
a list of requests for easing restrictions releasing children from 
jail and ending collective punishment against entire towns or 
refugee camps for the actions of protesters 
obeid said rabin made no promises he said if the intefadeh 
relaxes we will relax if it worsens the measures will get 
worse

the director of a fireworks production at 
which a shell exploded injuring 27 people said tuesday he can 
account for all the shells that were fired and the exploding one 
may have come from somewhere else 
we havent been able to substantiate that said lt arnold 
meyers who heads the arson abatement investigating the sunday 
evening accident during the annual dayton river festival 
thirteen people remained hospitalized all but one in good or 
fair condtion steven stevens 34 of springfield was in serious 
condition 
rick w leibert producer for national fireworks ensemble of los 
angeles believes the shell that exploded came from somewhere other 
than the launch area about 600 feet from the bank of the 
stillwater river where it hit 
the shells which normally travel 350 to 500 feet in the air 
before exploding are fired off electrically all 1500 ranging 
from 3 to 13 inches in diameter were sequenced and timed according 
to a script leibert said 
when we looked at the videotape the bursts were all in the 
sky where they should be when they were supposed to be he said 
meyers who said investigators had about 40 more witnesses to 
interview said an inspection of the site yielded little conclusive 
information 
we found a lot of debris along on the bank and some of the 
markings were not of the type that the show uses he said yet 
we didnt have any odor of gunpowder on it which would indicate a 
recently fired shell he said 
he said it would be several days before anything conclusive can 
be released 
most people were looking at the sky and werent paying any 
attention well get lucky if we find two of three people that saw 
something that dont have a claim in this meyers said 
san diego fireworks of california which supplied the shells and 
the necessary state and federal licenses carried the 1 million 
umbrella insurance policy required by the city leibert said 
fire chief glenn alexander said the shell appeared to explode 
twice leibert said his show did not use any doublebanger 
shells 
any drifting debris from the launching site also should have 
been pushed away from the accident scene by the prevailing winds 
he said 
meyers said that if the shell had come from the launch site it 
must have come out of a launch tube turned sharply right and 
skimmed 15 or 20 feet above the ground until hitting the bank 
leibert said the ensembles most recent show was for the 
kentucky derby weekend in louisville and its next show would be the 
july 4 celebration in columbus

die in traffic accidents said council spokeswoman barbara carraro 
the preliminary total late tuesday morning is right around the

traffic accidents the chicagobased council said 
the worst memorial day traffic toll in the last quartercentury 
was recorded in 1968 when 629 people died the lowest recorded 
toll in 1982 was 341 
about 390 traffic deaths on us roadways would be projected for 
a nonholiday threeday weekend this time of year council

nancy reagan contended tuesday that 
everything has been said about the flap over her astrology use 
in the white house but she let it be known she intends to tell her 
side of the story in her own time 
mrs reagan on a summit sidetrip to this baltic capital of the 
czars dismissed reporters repeated attempts to discuss the 
revelation that she has consulted astrologers to advise president 
reagan on his schedule 
it was the first time reporters had the opportunity to question 
her closely about the flap that arose last month when former white 
house chief of staff donald regan published his book for the 
record revealing the first ladys secret 
the former chief of staff painted an unflattering portrait of 
the first couple describing president reagan as an incurious 
passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative wife and 
mediaconscious staff 
regan also made clear his bitterness at being replaced at the 
white house at the height of the irancontra affair contending 
hed been ousted by a cabal controlled and initiated by the first 
lady 
at first mrs reagan refused to be drawn into any discussion of 
the matter declaring everything has been said about that that 
needs to be said 
at one point she was asked whether the stars were wrong for 
providing an answer and she gave the reporter a sharp disgusted 
look 
but when she was asked again whether she intended to write her 
own book about the flap she responded could be and laughed 
heartily 
queried whether she intended to go into detail in such a book 
she borrowed a line from a frank sinatra song to indicate that she 
was intent on telling her side of the story 
my way she said pointing at herself and repeating sternly 
my way 
and will regan be interested in what she had to say 
the first lady laughed again heartily and shot back 
absolutely

president reagan told soviet university 
students tuesday that maybe the american people made a mistake when 
they humored indians by giving them reservations rather than 
integrating them into society 
the head of the largest us indian organization called the 
remarks insulting 
maybe we made a mistake in trying to maintain indian 
cultures reagan said in answering questions at moscow state 
university maybe we should not have humored them in that 
wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe we 
should have said no come join us be citizens along with the 
rest of us 
reagan misspoke indians are citizens all american indians were 
made full citizens by an act of congress in 1924 it wasnt until 
1948 when court decisions gave them full voting rights in arizona 
and new mexico in local and state elections 
the 1980 census recorded 137 million indians of whom 332000 
were living on 260 reservations 
in washington suzan shown harjo a cheyenne and creek who is 
executive director of the national congress of american indians 
said i was appalled by the presidents performance but not 
surprised he has headed the worst administration for indians 
since the days of outright warfare and extermination 
i found particularly insulting his statement that perhaps the 
united states should not have humored them meaning us she 
said 
ms harjos organization counts 3500 individual members and 
tribes containing 850000 members 
responding to a students question reagan said he would be 
very happy to meet with three indians who went to moscow during 
the presidents summit meeting with kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
they went under the sponsorship of the militant american indian 
movement to call attention to their grievances among them hunger 
and lack of housing among indians the president has never met with 
indian groups 
reagan told the soviets that american indians from the 
beginning announced that they wanted to maintain their way of 
life as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains 
and so forth and we set up these reservations so they could and 
have a bureau of indian affairs to help take care of them 
the presidents remarks reflected decadesold oscillation in 
us policy toward native americans the federal government has 
flipflopped on whether indians should be encouraged to maintain 
their culture or abandon it and join the mainstream 
current policy is to maintain indian cultures treating the 
tribes as sovereign governments in their own right 
from 1887 to 1934 official policy was to try to turn indians 
into selfsufficient farmers although franklin roosevelts 
administration reversed the policy and originated the 
governmenttogovernment idea the eisenhower administration 
called for termination of tribes leading to assimilation of 
indians in the larger culture sixty tribes were dissolved though 
about half of those have been revived 
presidents kennedy and johnson reverted to a 
governmenttogovernment policy and president reagan has 
reaffirmed it 
by any standard indians are among the poorest of the poor but 
offreservation indians appear to do better than those on 
reservations 
the 1980 census found 12 percent of the nations population 
living in poverty but among indians poverty was found in 22 
percent of those living off reservations and 41 percent of those on 
reservations 
just this month the bureau of indian affairs released a report 
documenting performance on standard tests by pupils in the schools 
it runs they do worse than 79 percent of the nations pupils 
overall 
reagan told his moscow audience some indians became very 
wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great 
pools of oil and you can get very rich pumping oil 
although some tribes distribute royalty revenue to members 
others use the funds as tribal revenues 
tribal oil royalties soared with oil prices rising from 18 
million in 1973 to 147 million in 1982 but fell back to 81 
million last year as prices receded 
these figures do not include the osage tribe in oklahoma which 
manages its own lands and collects its own royalties by far the 
largest of any tribe the 4749member tribe got 71 million about 
15000 per tribal member in 1981 when oil prices were peaking 
gregory frazier president of the denverbased national urban 
indian council said there are a few indians who have done 
fairly well but there are probably fewer than 100 indians you 
could point to and say theyve got some wealth but thats not 
oil thats their own hard work 
frazier a crow said he got a check for 38 for oil royalties 
last year 
fraziers group tries to make sure indians living off the 
reservation arent forgotten or written out of federal legislation 
and tries to help those indians use state and local welfare 
agencies there are practically no federal programs devoted to 
offreservation indians 
indians leave the reservation because of education jobs and 
politics frazier said life can be very hard on a reservation 
if youre part of the out party 
im a fan of the president but the president is a little bit 
removed from the reality of american indians frazier said

demonstrations in south korea 
we support the right of free expression of opinion we

michael dukakis expects to clinch the democratic 
presidential nomination next week and then skipping the 
traditional break after the final primaries immediately begin his 
fall campaign with trips to more than a dozen states before the 
july convention 
dukakis aides say the massachusetts governor wants to broaden 
his exposure throughout the country his trips will include states 
considered vital to his chances in the fall including florida and 
texas republican strongholds in recent presidential elections 
we want to spend a good part of june out there in america 
traveling telling people who mike dukakis is and why he would be a 
good president said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
california new jersey new mexico and montana hold the final 
primaries june 7 five days later dukakis will attend a national 
conference of mayors convention in salt lake city his schedule 
then calls for a swing through texas florida georgia kentucky 
and north carolina 
at the end of june dukakis plans to visit several midwest 
states including wisconsin illinois minnesota and michigan he 
also plans another trip to california and other western states in 
early july the democratic national convention is july 1821 in 
atlanta 
vice president george bush who has enough delegate votes for 
the republican nomination plans campaigning in texas and colorado 
june 911 but is scheduled to spend the rest of june and all of 
july either in washington or at his summer home in maine a 
campaign spokeswoman said 
during the six weeks between the final primaries and the 
democratic convention dukakis also will have to select a running 
mate and plot convention strategy in addition to his state duties 
but aides say he can take care of business while traveling 
democratic party chairmen in florida and texas said tuesday they 
viewed early and frequent dukakis appearances in their states as 
vital to the massachusetts governors chances of winning them in 
november 
i certainly think it is imperative that he start early because 
he is not really well known in texas said texas democratic party 
chairman bob slagle he has a reasonable chance in texas i 
wholly agree with the strategy 
dukakis will attend the texas democratic convention june 1718 
when more than 10000 state delegates and alternates will be on 
hand 
bush represented texas in congress and claims the state as his 
home but recent polls have shown dukakis close behind bush and 
leading the vice president in a hypothetical race with texas sen 
lloyd bentsen as his running mate 
slagle said dukakis fluent spanish has made him popular among 
mexicanamerican voters and he predicted dukakis also would win 
overwhelming black support in the fall to beat bush in texas 
dukakis will have to do well among workingclass voters who are 
traditionally democrats but who supported president reagan in 1980 
and 1984 slagle said 
charles whitehead the florida party chairman was equally 
enthusiastic about dukakis fall chances in his state dukakis won 
the florida and texas primaries in march 
i think it can make the difference in whether or not we win 
florida whitehead said of the planned dukakis visit he said the 
latest poll in florida showed bush with a slight lead over dukakis 
as in texas the poll showed dukakis winning if he picks a favorite 
son running mate in this instance florida sen bob graham 
in 1984 reagan and former vice president walter mondale relaxed 
their campaign schedules between the final primaries and the 
conventions but reagan was an incumbent president and mondale also 
was well known 
as for dukakis plan bob beckel who managed the mondale 
campaign said i think its a very smart move for dukakis to do 
that it gives him a chance to work on his general election 
message being out there and being seen will go a long way

an officer posed as a buyer of 
stolen art to set up a raid at a hotel tuesday that recovered three 
stolen masterpieces worth up to 52 million police said 
the works by dutch painters vincent van gogh and johan jongkind 
and the french artist paul cezanne were recovered in a predawn 
raid on the pullman hotel police spokesman klaas wilting said they 
were about to be sold for 15 million west german marks 114 
million 
burglars took the paintings whose value has been estimated at 
up to 52 million from amsterdams municipal museum on may 20 
police said they arrested three suspects a 36yearold seller 
and two prospective buyers aged 32 and 44 all are of dutch 
nationality but were not identified further in keeping with 
standard police practice 
wilting would not reveal the undercover policemans relationship 
with the other two alleged buyers or give other details of his role 
he acknowledged however that the west german currency was 
provided by dutch authorities dutch television said the undercover 
agent had rented the two hotel rooms used for the transaction 
recovered were carnations an 1888 work by van gogh the 
1894 still life bottle with apples by cezanne and an 1874 
painting by jongkind the house of maitre billaud in nevers 
the van gogh was found inside the hotel and the other paintings 
were in a car outside all wrapped in blankets police said 
wilting said museum director wim beeren told him the cezanne had 
a small scratch but the other paintings were undamaged 
during the past week police received anonymous tips that 
buyers were being solicited abroad wilting said we got hard 
evidence of that early this week and thats when we decided to 
act he would not say why the price was set in west german 
currency 
undercover agents pseudobuyers as the police call them 
have appeared only recently as a tactic of dutch authorities their 
use is controversial because of allegations of entrapment 
although wilting said the alleged seller has a police record for 
burglary there was no immediate word on whether he was believed to 
be involved in the theft a groundfloor window was smashed before 
dawn to gain entry to the museum 
the museums 3200 art works primarily from the 19th and 20th 
centuries have been guarded during the night only by an electronic 
alarm system since 1975 when guards were removed to save money 
an electronic alarm at a private security firm sounded when the 
window was broken but reports indicated authorities were not 
notified for up to 20 minutes 
beeren the museum director speculated after the burglary that 
the theft was commissioned by a private collector since it would 
be very difficult to sell the paintings 
he gave the value estimate of 100 million guilders or 52 
million and said it was based on the record prices brought by van 
gogh works at recent auctions 
last november a collector paid 53 million for irises at a 
new york auction and eight months earlier van goghs 
sunflowers went for 298 million at a london auction 
experts from the london auction house christies estimated the 
total value of the stolen paintings at only 21 million guilders 
11 million with the van gogh worth 1621 million

a new genetically engineered protein kills 
transplantattacking cells in mice suggesting it might someday 
eliminate the need for risky and costly antirejection drugs in 
transplant patients researchers said tuesday 
they expect the protein to be introduced for some leukemia 
patients this fall and for human transplant patients in a year or 
so the leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease marked 
by an excess of transplantattacking blood cells 
this is not only more powerful but its far more selective 
than conventional antirejection treatment said dr terry strom 
director of clinical immunology at beth israel hospital in boston 
this therapy only zaps the cells that are active against the 
transplanted organ at that time and doesnt depress the 
diseasefighting immune system across the board he said at the 
annual meeting of the american society of transplant physicians 
dr lawrence g hunsicker the societys president said the 
findings represent terribly important work 
the hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidney 
transplant and put in whatever one you have available hunsicker 
said maybe tissue matching at that point wouldnt make a 
difference 
researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the new 
protein a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin one of the 
deadliest known toxins and the natural immune system protein 
interleukin2 
when the bodys immune system is confronted with unfamiliar 
material such as bacteria or a transplanted organ it fights back 
with a group of cells called tcells 
the foreign substances activate a small number of tcells which 
produce interleukin2 receptors points on the cell surface to 
which only interleukin2 molecules will stick 
activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascade 
that activates more harmful cells which then attack the 
transplanted organ leading to rejection of the foreign tissue 
to prevent this from happening strom and dr jack murphy chief 
of biomolecular medicine at boston university medical center 
isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to other 
cells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin2 
molecule 
the result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches to 
only those tcells harmful to transplanted organs and kills the 
tcells with the toxin 
the idea for this particular magic bullet is to use it right 
after the transplant strom said 
over the past year the researchers have tested the fusion 
protein on mice that underwent heart transplants 
ten mice were injected with the protein immediately after 
transplantation and received no other antirejection therapy said 
dr robert kirkman a transplant surgeon at brigham and womens 
hospital in boston the injections were administered daily for 10 
days 
nine of the 10 mice appeared to retain their new hearts 
permanently without need for chronic therapy kirkman said 
all the mice receiving the fusion protein fared better than 
those that received no treatment and those injected with only a 
fragment of the diphtheria toxin 
were encouraged we like what we see kirkman said 
when the dose was increased 100 times some kidney abnormalities 
were noted kirkman said but no side effects were noted at 
therapeutic levels 
cyclosporine an antirejection drug approved for general use by 
the us food and drug administration in 1983 suppresses the 
bodys entire immune system and therefore enhances the risk of 
infection side effects include kidney failure excessive hair 
growth and tremors 
cyclosporine also costs transplant patients 5000 a year or 
more 
researchers plan to test the fusion protein on monkeys then 
patients suffering from tcell leukemia without any other hope 
trials on transplant patients will follow pending fda approval 
in humans its likely the fusion protein will be accompanied by 
cyclosporine strom said 
we have reason to think it will work well with cyclosporine in 
low doses he said so maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will 
go a long way with this toxin 
researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used to 
treat autoimmune diseases in which the body produces a disordered 
immunological response against itself such diseases include forms 
of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis 
its the promise for the future thats very exciting murphy

5 percent to 6 percent is expected to pump 704 million into the 
states hardpressed treasury between now and july 1 1989 
paul mckown president of the west virginia retailers 
association said that despite objections to the higher tax which 
was to take effect at midnight tuesday most people feel they 
have an obligation to participate and pay the bills of the state 
and this is one way of doing it 
the tax increase was part of an elaborate compromise worked out 
among the governor and the legislature as they battled over 
finances earlier this year when the state was forced to borrow 80 
million on a shortterm basis to meet operating expenses 
the compromise was approved during the march 22 oneday special 
session of the legislature the increased sales tax is expected to 
raise 54 million for the remaining month of this fiscal year and 
and an estimated 65 million during the fiscal year that starts 
july 1 
it is due to expire on june 30 1989 although some merchants 
have said they expect it to become permanent after the general 
election in november 
the tax was included in a bill that allowed the governor to 
borrow 30 million from the state black lung fund for miners to 
meet a backlog in medicaid payments for medical treatment for the 
poor the sales tax is to be used in part for the payback on the 
loan money 
mckown said the temporary tax will cause little inconvenience 
for the states 25000 to 30000 retailers who collect and send 
the tax to the state tax department 
the states border counties may see a temporary exodus of 
customers to other states but mckown said he does not expect that 
to last long if it even occurs surrounding kentucky 
pennsylvania ohio and maryland have a 5 percent sales tax 
virginia has a 4 percent tax rate 
moore has called two more special legislative sessions to deal 
with finances 
the second special session starts wednesday and will cover all 
areas but education moore has proposed a nickelagallon gasoline 
tax increase to meet his proposed budget 
the third special session will be dedicated to education which 
takes up 72 percent of moores proposed 146billion budget the 
governor has threatened to revive several taxes which failed 
passage in the legislature previously no date has been set for the 
third session

antiapartheid clergymen ended an 
unprecedented emergency conference tuesday with a church service at 
which they called for intensified nonviolent resistance to the 
government 
we are determined we are going to obey god whatever the 
cost said anglican archbishop desmond tutu we are on the 
march he shouted as a mostly black audience of 1200 people 
shouted cheered and whistled 
the 1984 nobel peace prize winner then removed symbolic gags 
from the mouths of black and white youths on the podium took up a 
wooden cross and carried it back and forth down the center aisle of 
the regina mundi cathedral the audience held hands and swayed 
together singing we shall overcome 
participating church leaders said they would try to mobilize 
support for a threeday national protest planned next week by black 
trade unions 
they also disclosed plans for a campaign seeking release of 
political prisoners to start june 12 and end july 18 the 70th 
birthday of jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches said we are not trying to undermine 
authority or advocate anarchy we are distinguishing between two 
different kinds of authority 
the rev allan boesak mixedrace leader of the world alliance 
of reformed churches said he wanted the convocation to adopt a 
stronger statement calling for more protests and direct 
confrontation with the government 
i was hoping the convocation would ask for a personal 
commitment that not all church leaders are ready to make either in 
their personal capacities or on behalf of the churches said 
boesak it will take time but we are moving away from a theology 
of protest to a life of protest and resistance 
chikane said there was division among the church leaders the 
largest group in many years to gather to discuss action against 
white domination 
he said the decision to support the national protest next week 
was significant but added that the church leaders had decided to 
form a committee to work out details of specific actions 
during the convocation workshops were held to discuss a range 
of antiapartheid tactics including noncooperation and 
noncollaboration with the government the agenda suggested that 
targets of civil disobedience could include tax payments military 
service and racially oriented laws such as those mandating 
segregated residential areas 
people attending the church service were asked to take these and 
other proposals back to their congregations for consideration 
the convocation was sponsored by the south african council of 
churches which includes major protestant denominations active in 
the fight for black rights also participating were the roman 
catholic church and a number of independent african churches 
organizers said political conditions in the country have 
worsened since leading clergymen decided in early february to 
organize the convocation 
they cited the effective bannings of 17 antiapartheid 
organizations the closure of two opposition newspapers and 
pending legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition 
political groups

the state department expressed hope tuesday 
that pakistani president mohammed zia ulhaq will follow his 
dismissal of the prime minister with prompt free and fair 
elections 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said zias decision to fire prime 
minister mohammed khan junejo last weekend appeared to be within 
rules set by the pakistani constitution 
we note president zias may 30th statement that there will be 
no reversion to martial law and that basic freedoms including 
speech press and assembly remain intact we also note the 
presidents statement on holding national elections we hope that 
those elections will be held promptly and that they will be free 
and fair she said 
zia who came to power in a coup in 1977 granted power to a 
civilian government three years ago but the constitution permits 
the president to dismiss the government if he feels there has been 
a breakdown of law and order the constitution provides for 
elections to be held within 90 days 
asked if the united states would send officials to monitor the 
elections mrs oakley said all that is very premature im sure 
well be watching as the election process develops 
pakistans 645 million in us aid for the current fiscal year 
puts it third on the list of nations receiving american assistance 
behind only israel and egypt zias country receives so much 
because it acts as a funnel for aid to usbacked resistance 
forces in afghan and provides a haven for more than two million 
refugees from the afghanistan war 
mrs oakley said the assistance would not be affected by the 
political developments in pakistan

nancy reagan raced through the 
palaces of this czaristbuilt capital tuesday declaring the vast 
art collection at the hermitage staggering but lamenting the 
monstrosities of modernday highrises that blocked the view of 
the famous skyline 
mrs reagan said she found the soviet people very warm and 
very open 
but as for raisa gorbachev well shes a everybodys 
different mrs reagan said with a shrug 
tens of thousands of waving smiling citizens clustered along 
the main thoroughfares nevsky and moscow prospekts as her 
twodozen car motorcade slowed to take in the array of columed 
buildings domed churches and wide squares and statues that adorn 
the imperial inner city area 
and as she admired the maze of boulevards and buildings she 
lamented the monstrosities of modernday highrises erected on 
the edge of the city 
staggering staggering theres just too much to digest the 
first lady exclaimed at the end of her fivehour tour of this city 
on the baltic founded by peter the great in 1703 and embellished 
by czars and czarinas over the decades 
queried whether she had any more sympathy for communism after 
viewing the extravagent finery used by the imperial family before 
the revolution she replied quickly no 
the outpouring of affection that surrounded mrs reagan appeared 
to be spontaneous officials had not released her route in advance 
and people lined the main streets to catch a glimpse of her she 
appeared as a speck of yellow in the back of a large black 
limousine 
asked by american reporters during the flight here about her 
handholding with raisa gorbachev at earlier meetings this week 
mrs reagan replied with a shrug of her shoulders i dont know 
it just sort of happened 
although mrs gorbachev declined to join mrs reagans tour she 
arranged for lidiya gromyko the wife of soviet president andrei 
gromyko to accompany her 
the first lady said she found mrs gromyko very nice very 
friendly very warm 
but asked if she had the same reaction to her tours with mrs 
gorbachev mrs reagan smiled and sat silent 12 seconds pondering 
her answer 
well shes a everybodys different she finally said 
evoking laughter from the reporters 
when someone asked if mrs gromyko lectured as much as mrs 
gorbachev mrs reagan joined in the uproarius laughter just 
between us mrs reagan asked turning to one reporter how 
many viewers and readers do you have 
after another long pause she tried to drop the subject 
pleading im desperately trying to think 
mrs reagan and mrs gorbachev will get back together on 
wednesday to view icons in the famous tretyakhov gallery in moscow 
mrs reagan started her tour as most foreign dignitaries do by 
paying homage to the 650000 russians who starved to death during 
the 900 day siege of the city by the nazi invaders in 1941 more 
than a million people died in the defense of the city during the 
war 
in a solemn ritual mrs reagan placed a bouquet of red 
carnations at the austere dark stone monument to the heroic 
defenders 
from there she traveled to the hermitage whose art collection 
one of the most fabulous in the world was begun in 1764 by 
catherine the great with a lecturer from the museum whispering 
into her ear mrs reagan was whisked by masterpieces by leonardo 
da vinci caravaggio and other italian flemish spanish and 
french artists 
oh so much to see she exclaimed at one point dramatically 
clapping both hands to her head 
the mrs gromyko who had some trouble negotiating the many 
stairs and hectic schedule was heard to observe of the american 
pace so quick they stand they go asked if she were tired 
she said of course im tired im 77 years old how could i not 
be tired 
the final leg on mrs reagans tour was a trip by hydrofoil to 
peter the greats summer palace she was accompanied by dmitri 
likhachev a famous soviet specialist in early russian literature 
who has backed the preservation of older buildings 
as the boat passed a series of complexes of austere highrise 
apartment buildings likhachev commented that they were 
impersonal to which mrs reagan agreed he mentioned that the 
buildings now blocked a view of the citys famous skyline 
progress doesnt always mean something wonderful mrs 
reagan observed gesturing towards the buildings but what are we 
going to do about those monstrosities

patrick alley the reggae musician who 
claimed mick jagger stole his music has filed notice he will 
appeal the verdict against him in his copyright lawsuit 
lawyer jerome g lee jr said tuesday he had filed a notice of 
appeal in us district court because he had found new evidence 
jagger could have heard alleys song he would not elaborate 
alley 36 of the bronx claimed the chorus of jaggers 1985 hit 
just another night had been stolen from his 1979 song of the 
same title 
the jury found that jagger could not have heard alleys song 
which was released both in new york and britain and played on 
several small radio stations in new york in 1983 
alley said he copyrighted his song in 1983 because drummer sly 
dunbar who played with jagger on the album told him his song was 
being ripped off according to trial testimony alley said 
dunbar also played on his version 
alley claimed that jagger had earned as much as 6 million from 
the song 
jagger whose song was copyrighted in 1985 testified he had 
never heard alleys song 
dunbar who testified for jagger said he could not remember 
playing on alleys recording and denied ever telling alley the tune 
was being plagiarized 
jaggers attorney peter parcher said through his assistant 
that he would comment if an appeal actually was filed 
a notice of appeal which must be filed within 30 days of a 
verdict does not mean an actual appeal would be filed appeal 
papers must be filed with the 2nd circuit us court of appeals 
which would hear arguments

candidate though he continued his presidential campaign one week 
before the final primaries

democratic national convention in july to fight for platform planks 
or other issues he considers important

speech he also renewed his calls for equal rights and justice 
making america better is our challenge invest in the people

would accept if he should receive an offer from democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis to be the massachusetts governors 
running mate

consideration to dukakis

lick observatory a pioneering 
mountaintop astronomical complex that once boasted the worlds 
largest telescope observes its 100th skywatching anniversary 
wednesday 
it was at lick where edward barnard found the fifth moon of 
jupiter where the existence was established of innumerable distant 
galaxies where expansion of the universe was mapped and where 
scientists studied how stars form and age 
businessman james lick who set up a trust and earmarked 
700000 for construction of the telescope and observatory made 
his orders clear build a powerful telescope superior and more 
powerful than any telescope yet made 
lick died in 1876 12 years before the observatory was ready for 
operation but his remains were moved to mount hamiliton in january 
1887 and placed in a vault at the base of the lick telescope 
astronomy was a strange choice for lick who got his start 
making pianos in south america made a fortune in california real 
estate and once owned catalina island and big pieces of downtown 
san francisco 
lick observatory was built on 4430foot mount hamilton and an 
immense 36inch lens was mounted on a 57foot tube then the 
worlds biggest telescope 
it was the first real demonstration of the value of being on a 
mountaintop said joseph miller an assistant lick director 
noting that before lick most observatories were in cities 
later mountaintop observatories became standard encouraging 
the development of other pristine sites including those in chile 
hawaii and southern california 
owned and operated by the university of califoria the 
observatory 60 miles south of san francisco has lost some of its 
glitter but its seven telescope domes offices and workshops have 
a world reputation for solid valuable work 
the telescope still functions second in size only to the 
40inch refracting telescope at yerkes observatory in wisconsin 
the lick telescopes today also include the 120inch shane 
reflector a 40inch reflector two 24inch reflectors and a twin 
20inch refractor the telescopes are used all the time and are 
most in demand for moonless nights 
lick also pioneered the use of reflecting telescopes which use 
a mirror instead of a lens to focus light

president reagan and kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev plan to close their fourth summit with a joint communique 
celebrating progress on two obstacles to a strategic arms treaty a 
us official said tuesday 
the leaders who attended signing ceremonies tuesday for less 
important agreements on wednesday also will exchange copies of a 
ratified treaty to eliminate us and soviet mediumrange missiles 
that pact was signed at the summit last december ratified 
within the past week by the us senate and the soviet presidium 
and flown to moscow by white house chief of staff howard h baker 
jr 
progress on the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty came on 
a us proposal for verifying limits on mobile missiles and a 
compromise on counting airlaunched cruise missiles said the 
senior administration official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
but no progress was reported on star wars which the soviets 
describe as the main impediment to a start agreement to cut 
longrange weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
at the december summit both leaders said they hoped to sign a 
strategic arms pact in moscow but talks stalled over star wars 
mobile missiles rules on counting cruise missiles aboard 
warplanes curbs on cruise missiles on submarines and a us call 
to phase out heavy soviet ss18 missiles 
gorbachev expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks 
although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed by 
the end of the reagan presidency 
gorbachev told reporters tuesday that maybe its time to bang 
our fists on the table to end the impasse 
reagan replied ill do anything that works but said he 
would not bargain away star wars formally known as the strategic 
defense initiative 
its never been a part of the negotiations said reagan 
because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles the united 
states had wanted to ban them although it is developing one the 
midgetman the soviets declined to get rid of their two mobile 
missiles the ss24 and ss25 
during the summit american negotiators offered a proposal they 
had been working on for months to restrict mobile missiles to 
carefully defined geographical areas dubbed garrisons which 
would be monitored by onsite inspection as well as surveillance 
from spy satellites 
the soviets reacted positively to our proposal said the 
us official 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov referred on 
monday to progress on the mobile issue but neither the soviets nor 
the americans gave details of the proposal 
arms control working groups headed by paul nitze for the 
americans and marshal sergei akhromeyev for the soviets also moved 
toward a compromise on counting the number of cruise missiles 
aboard warplanes 
the americans proposed that certain air bases be designated for 
nucleartipped cruise missiles with every warplane stationed there 
counted as carrying an agreed number of weapons said the us 
official 
the two sides have set to a limit of 6000 warheads apiece each 
bomber carrying gravity bombs and shortrange airlaunched missiles 
would be counted as one warhead 
but negotiators have not agreed how many warheads to count as 
being aboard each warplane the americans want to discount the 
number counting each heavy bomber as carrying 10 cruise missiles 
whereas the russians would put the number closer to 20 
soviet officials complained that the united states had rejected 
a soviet proposal to resolve another sticking point verifying 
proposed limits on submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
roald sagdeyev a soviet scientist who has advised gorbachev on 
armsrelated issues told a news conference that the us navy was 
blocking progress by sticking to its policy of refusing to 
acknowledge whether or not a submarine or ship carries nuclear 
weapons 
sagdeyev said the americans had rejected a soviet proposal for 
an experiment to determine whether nuclearmissiles can be detected 
aboard ships by measuring neutron and gamma ray emissions 
reagan and gorbachev will issue their joint communique as the 
summit winds up they had one more business session scheduled for 
wednesday and then a departure ceremony on thursday 
another senior us official who also demanded anonymity said 
the statment would be issued wednesday or thursday depending on 
the pace of talks senior negotiators were holding 
in addition to the planned exchange of the ratified 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty and progress in the start 
talks the two sides signed a handful of lesser agreements on 
tuesday 
secretary of state george p shultz and his soviet counterpart 
eduard a shevardnadze signed agreements on prior notification of 
ballistic missile tests and for an experiment to tighten 
verification techniques on a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 
150 kilotons 
the head of the us information agency charles z wick and 
soviet culture minister vasily zakharov signed a protocol extending 
for another three years a cultural agreement signed in 1985 other 
agreements were signed covering transportation civilian atomic 
reactor programs radio navigation fisheries and maritime rescue

a committee of gun owners filed petitions 
tuesday to block marylands pioneering ban on sales of saturday 
night specials or cheap handguns and to force a public vote on the 
gun control bill in november 
fred griisser chairman of the maryland committee against the 
gun ban submitted petitions to the secretary of state that he said 
contained signatures of more than 22000 voters opposed to the ban 
the committee will need 33044 valid signatures by the end of 
june to force the bill to referendum and at least onethird of 
those were due tuesday 
griisser challenged statements by supporters of the law that it 
will only ban saturday night specials that serve no useful lawful 
purpose 
we feel that this bill has the potential to ban all 
handguns he said 
if the law survives the challenge from gun owners it will be 
illegal to sell or manufacture any handguns in maryland unless they 
are approved by a ninemember review board appointed by the 
governor 
the board is directed to ban guns that are cheaply made of poor 
quality materials and are so inaccurate that they cant be used for 
sporting purposes or self defense it also is directed to ban guns 
made of plastics or ceramics that cant be detected by metal 
detectors 
it is the first state law attempting to ban the sale of saturday 
night specials and gliisser said putting it to a vote in november 
is going to be a test case for the nation 
the bill drew broad support from gun control groups when it was 
signed may 23 by gov william donald schaefer 
among those attending was white house press secretary james 
brady who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt 
on president reagan by john hinckley jr who was armed with the 
type of gun that would be banned by the maryland law 
griisser said his committee has collected about 80000 
including 50000 from the national rifle association for its 
drive to defeat the gun law 
gun owners are petitioning only one part of the bill they want 
to retain the second part which would repeal a ruling by the 
maryland court of appeals that victims of crimes committed with 
saturday night specials can sue the makers and sellers of the 
handguns 
state attorney general j joseph curran said tuesday he hopes to 
rule by next week whether only half of the bill can be subject to 
referendum and if so whether the repeal of the court ruling can 
stand if the rest of the law is defeated by voters

cemeteries in the san francisco bay area in the second day of a 
strike by gravediggers with no new contract talks scheduled 
members of the cemetery workers and greens attendant union local 
265 have complained that under current provisions cemetery owners 
can hire subcontractors for work usually performed by union 
employees 
however john cantwell an attorney representing two 
associations of cemetery owners said the union concerns are 
unfounded 
weve given them every assurance that owners contracting 
out is not aimed at busting the union cantwell said i think 
the objection is more emotional than rational 
cantwell said owners have always used subcontractors forts such as 
laying concrete and removing hazardous trees 
under the owners provisions subcontractors would be certain 
projec used only for 
jobs that would not threaten union positions he said 
but theyve said that until we take that off the table they 
are unwilling to negotiate about anything he said 
the business agent for the local said the specific jobs that can 
be contracted out are broadly mentioned in the current provisions 
its nice to have assurances but were negotiating a contract 
here said carolyn del gaudio their proposal is based on an 
openended pclosed early tuesday

media people stay close to the press center watching outside 
events on television monitors and attending press briefings by a 
steady stream of us and soviet officials 
i really havent had time to get out since reagan arrived

a group of international experts returned tuesday 
from a fourday visit to afghanistan pakistan and iran to help 
prepare an appeal for a huge aid program to the area 
paer stenbaeck secretarygeneral of the international league of 
the red cross was among the group headed by prince sadruddin aga 
khan the un relief coordinator for afghanistan 
stenbaeck said the groups talks confirmed the need for a 
stepbystep approach in repatriating the more than 5 million 
afghan refugees who have fled to neighboring pakistan and iran 
at this time no one can say whether there will be a 
spontaneous or orderly repatriation stenbaeck said in an 
interview we have to work with two different scenarios 
he said the new afghan prime minister mohammed hassan sharq 
indicated that plans could be made to receive 1 million returnees a 
year stenbaeck said the clear message from leaders of the 
moslem guerrillas who also met with the group was that under 
present conditions the refugees should not return 
guerrilla leaders said the situation may change after aug 15 
the date by which half of the 100000 soviet troops are scheduled 
to have left afghanistan under a settlement signed in geneva april 
14 
a swedishfinanced survey released monday in stockholm said it 
would take years and billions of dollars before agricultural 
production could be brought back to levels that could support the 
returning refugees 
stenbaeck said another major barrier to repatriation was the 
estimated 5 million antipersonnel mines strewn across afghanistan 
who will take the responsibility for clearing them he asked

soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov charged tuesday that one of the dissidents and refuseniks 
invited to meet president reagan was a nazi war criminal 
gerasimov made the allegation at a news conference when asked to 
comment on a question from a moscow student to reagan that he had 
invited the gestapo or german polizei to his monday meeting 
with dissidents and refuseniks and their families 
the student was repeating an allegation voiced tuesday by the 
soviet news agency tass which said that nikolai rozhko one of 
those at the meeting with reagan voluntarily joined nazi 
police in 1942 one year after the nazi invasion of the soviet 
union in world war ii 
the communist party newspaper pravda and government daily 
izvestia also carried negative commentaries on the meeting 
attacking some of the participants by name 
tass said rozhko was sentenced to death by military tribunal in 
1944 but that his sentence was later commuted to 20 years 
imprisonment in 1955 rozhko was released on parole under a soviet 
government decree tass said it did not say why 
gerasimov said soviet journalists who attended reagans 
reception for the dissidents which was criticized by soviet 
officials turned up the background on rozhko by looking at soviet 
records 
they were rather curious and looked into the dossier of the 
invited gerasimov explained they found out that one of them 
in fact was a policeman sharing in the occupation of our country by 
germany so he was a former nazi agent and a war criminal 
when asked about the allegation that a former nazi was invited 
to the meeting reagan told the moscow student he did not know 
anything about the man 
a us official who asked not to be identified said rozhko is a 
resident of the town of grozdno in byelorussia a part of the 
western soviet union ravaged during nazi occupation 
rozhko was born in the united states and came to the soviet 
union as a child with his parents the official said he has been 
trying to emigrate for the past 20 years but the soviets have 
denied him permission to leave 
the source suggested that soviet authorities have charged before 
that rozhko had a nazi background but never once gave us one 
shred of evidence of his nazi activities the official said 
this was not an issue on rozhkos emigration until the soviets 
brought it up this week 
memories of the struggle against the nazis in world war ii are 
kept vividly alive in the soviet union which estimates that 20 
million citizens died in battles against adolf hitlers troops 
the soviet charges against rozhko were likely therefore to lend 
a highly negative connotation to reagans meeting with the 
refuseniks which unlike all other events in his program was 
reported with negative comment by the staterun soviet media 
a senior soviet journalist speaking privately said that 
commentators at first were horrified when they learned of reagans 
plans to meet with dissidents and refuseniks at his moscow 
residence but he indicated they were then ordered to tone comment 
down and communist party leaders had made clear there would be no 
other reaction to the meeting he said 
pravda quoting reagans reference to poet alexander pushkin 
that its time for more kremlin reforms said indeed its 
time time to stop speculating on the problems of human rights 
using this serious question as an easy reason for 
selfadvertisement and politicizing 
izvestia criticized participants at the meeting including 
alexander ogorodnikov a religious activist it accused of links 
with antisoviet clerical centers abroad lev timofeyev a 
campaigner for press freedom and abe stolar a 73yearold 
american citizen who has been trying to emigrate with his family 
since 1975 
tass and izvestia accused the people invited to meet reagan at 
the us ambassadors residence of opposing official efforts at 
reform and have nothing to do with efforts at changing the soviet 
union because they want only to leave or to dismantle its communist 
system 
those invited to spaso house are hampering reforms by their 
noisy behavior because far from being interested in them they are 
pursuing their selfish goals selfadvertisement gifts and praise 
from the west izvestia said

soviet monuments and museums as well as the leningrad tour

standing beneath a towering bust of lenin 
president reagan quoted from boris pasternaks oncebanned doctor 
zhivago tuesday in a fervent plea that the first breath of 
freedom be allowed to flourish in the soviet state 
he won a standing ovation from about 2000 teachers and students 
at moscow state university where his host soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev earned a degree in 1954 
in a session that covered topics as diverse as the plight of 
american indians to the twoterm restriction on american 
presidents reagan took questions from a stage beneath lenins bust 
and a banner emblazoned with a hammer and sickle 
let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on 
human freedom said reagan from one of the greatest writers of 
the 20th century 
with that he quoted pasternaks famous novel banned for many 
years in the land where its author lived 
i think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down 
by threats any kind of threat whether of jail or of retirbution 
after death then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion 
tamer in the circus with his whip not the prophet who sacrificed 
himself but this is just the point what has for centuries raised 
man above the beast in not the cudgel but an inward music the 
irresistible power of unarmed truth 
soviet young people are living in one of the most exciting 
hopeful times in soviet history reagan said when the first 
breath of freedom stirs in the air 
the world is undergoing an economic revolution but progress 
is not foreordained he said the key is freedom freedom of 
thought freedom of information freedom of communication he 
said 
one student told reagan that a delegation of american indians 
had traveled here because they found it impossible to meet with him 
in washington reagan said he did not know they had sought an 
audience and that id be very happy to see them 
he said the united states had given the indians millions of 
acres of land and established reservations where they could live if 
they chose weve done everything we can to meet their demands as 
to how they want to live maybe we made a mistake maybe we should 
not have humored them and insisted that they become integrated in 
american life 
he also said that after he leaves the white house he would 
deliver afterdinner speeches preaching his conservative political 
agenda and campaigning for a constitutional amendment restoring a 
presidents ability to serve more than two full terms 
in a luncheon meeting with writers filmmakers and other artists 
at the writers union reagan praised what he called a recent thaw 
in the soviet arts 
dancer mikhail baryshnikov and cellist slava rostropovich should 
be able to perform again in moscow and nobel prize winning author 
alexander solzhenitsyn should be published in the land he dearly 
loves reagan said 
he spoke very sincerely he spoke about his private life and 
he mentioned all those names which are very dear to russian 
intelligentsia fyodor burlatsky an adviser to gorbachev said 
after reagans speech at the writers union 
but dan unguryanu a history student from the soviet republic of 
moldavia said the leader of a great country should be more 
intellectual 
but he is charismatic said unguryanu he added that in 
signing a treaty banning medium and shorterrange nuclear 
missiles reagan has shown us a good example of american 
political pragmatism 
mikhail vasyanin 20 a student in the linguistic department and 
a member of the young communists league said really the term 
great communicator is good for him he said that some of 
reagans answers did not correspond to the questions but he made a 
good imression anyway 
physics graduate student alexander glazkov 23 said its too 
bad ronald reagan has to leave office there are those who dont 
agree with me but id like to see him elected to a third term 
students interviewed before and after the meeting said they were 
members of the young communist league and had received their 
tickets from the organization 
students from different university departments approached two 
microphones in an orderly manner suggesting their order and 
questions were prearranged

a flight attendant who was injured when a pilot 
abruptly turned a continental airlines dc9 to avoid a small plane 
said tuesday that passengers remained calm and she didnt know what 
happened until after they landed 
milotka liebelt said she was bent over her luggage near the rear 
of the airplane when the small plane was spotted about 100 feet 
away 
it just happened in a splitsecond mrs liebelt said 
tuesday from her akron home before i could realize what was 
going on i was on the floor with my bag in my lap 
mrs liebelt was the only person reported injured when 
continental flight 283 narrowly missed colliding with the small 
plane while the jet prepared to land monday at cleveland hopkins 
international airport the flight from boston to cleveland carried 
79 passengers and a crew of five 
mrs liebelt 35 was treated at southwest general hospital for 
bruises to her back and left knee 
i dont see how that small plane could not have seen us 
she said thank god that our first officer responded instantly 
the first officer copilot observed a light aircraft 
approximately 100 feet below our aircraft and to the right he 
initiated a sharp climb to the left and gained an additional 800 
feet of altitude said continental spokesman ned walker in 
houston the continential pilot did a professional job in 
reacting the way he had been trained 
walker said the airline does not release crew members names 
the federal aviation administration and the national 
transportation safety board are investigating the incident 
officials said tuesday the encounter occurred in restricted air 
space at about 7000 feet and five miles southeast of the airport

didnt show up on radar 
small planes entering restricted airspace near airports are 
required to get tower permission and to carry transponders which 
produce a signal to display airplane identification on radar 
screens 
mrs liebelt said the flight had been uneventful and the 
passengers who were in their seats in preparation for landing at 
the time of the sudden maneuver remained calm 
its amazing when things happen you dont have time to get 
scared you just assume your responsibilities she said 
mrs liebelt said the planes captain told the passengers what

federal agents slapped 10000 worth of citations 
on the owner of a mexican restaurant chain tuesday claiming he is 
houstons most blatant employer of illegal aliens 
immigration and naturalization service agents delivered 
citations and notices of intent to fine to lawyers for ghulan 
bombaywala president and chief executive officer of marcos 
restaurants inc the chain operates 10 mexican restaurants that 
employ about 500 people ins officials said 
bombaywalas lawyer said the government was overreacting 
under provisions of the 1986 immigration reform act tuesday was 
the last day federal officials had to serve citations before 
issuing fines 
starting wednesday we can go directly to the fine thats the 
major difference beginning june 1 ins district director ronald 
parra said at a news conference 
parra said bombaywala and his lawyer harry gee had 30 days to 
respond to tuesdays notices by either paying the fine or 
requesting a hearing before a federal administrative law judge gee 
said they likely would request the hearing 
ins officials said they raided one marcos restaurant in january 
and arrested 18 illegal aliens working there in april another 
raid netted nine illegal workers 
he didnt have any intention to clean up his act said 
michael mcmahon ins deputy director in charge of employer 
sanctions the top rung of the ladder the corporate structure 
had some knowledge 
but gee said the ins citations and fines were an overreaction by 
the government and the result of a misunderstanding 
our client has made very strenuous efforts to comply gee 
said all of our people now are in compliance 
gee who described bombaywala as a pakistani who has become a 
us citizen said his client has made goodfaith efforts by 
meeting with ins officials and by getting attorneys for 
undocumented aliens who wished to apply for amnesty 
we have a disagreement with the ins as to what constitutes a 
goodfaith effort gee said 
he estimated more than 100 aliens had been aided by bombaywala 
ronald finch the ins special agent who delivered the fourpage 
citation and intent to fine to gee with about a dozen reporters and 
photographers in tow said the houston ins office was working about 
25 such cases with around 15 nearing the stage at which fines will 
be sought 
parra said most of the 66000 houston businesses have cooperated 
with immigration officials to comply with the tough new federal 
laws regarding hiring of illegal aliens 
we are not going to tolerate noncompliance with the law he 
said the message to employers is its no longer good business 
to hire illegal aliens

tuesday in a general strike that shut down factories and mass

were dismissed from the communist party for alleged negligence that 
led to the violence between armenians and azerbaijanis 
in the armenian capital of yerevan roundtheclock 
demonstrations were reported to be continuing for a fifth day 
the resident of the city of stepanakert reached by telephone 
from moscow said public transport was not running and that 
factories and other businesses in the city were closed in a strike 
that had been going on for days 
people arent working the woman said asked how many she 
answered many thousands everyone she hung up the telephone 
before a reporter could ask her name or other questions 
in moscow dissident journalist sergei grigoryants said the 
general strike had been under way for about a week 
telephone calls to stepanakert city offices and radio and 
television stations did not go through 
stepanakert is the main city of nagornokarabakh a region in 
the republic of azerbaijan armenians want the armeniandominated 
region to be made a part of their neighboring republic 
armenian literary critic rafael popoyan 45 said by telephone 
from his yerevan home that since friday about 5000 people have 
gathered during the day and 20000 in the evening on the square 
outside the citys opera theater he said smaller groups of 
protesters mostly students continued the vigil overnight 
awaiting an official response to their demand 
the protesters want armenias supreme soviet the republics 
parliament to consider the annexation issue at a meeting next 
week he said 
popoyan who spent four years in jail and six months in internal 
exile for distributing underground literature said yerevan 
authorities have not tried to stop the demonstrations 
on monday grigoryants who is halfarmenian and halfrussian 
said the crowd in yerevan swelled to about 300000 it was unclear

moslem 
the soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction 
over nagorokarabakh opting instead for a program of social and 
economic development 
on may 21 communist party officials fired the two leaders of 
armenia and azerbaijan apparently because they had not quelled the 
unrest 
new party shakeups were announced tuesday tass said the former 
first secretary of the nagornokarabakh regional party committee 
boris kevorkov was dismissed from the party because of his 
serious political mistakes 
his errors resulted in the loss of the party organizations 
vanguard role and in the heightening of interethnic relations 
tass said in announcing the action taken by a plenary meeting of 
the azerbaijani party organization he was found to be personally 
responsible for the disorders that took place in the autonomous 
region 
kevorkov had been dismissed as head of the nagornokarabakh 
party committee on feb 24 he was replaced by genrikh pogosyan 
subsequently identified by tass as an armenian born in

of four hearings it will hold before the national convention in new 
orleans 
sen nancy kassebaum of kansas said in remarks to the committee 
that the value of the platform should be restored by shortening it 
and not making it a catchall and promiseall 
democratic party chairman paul kirk has made a similar request 
concerning his partys platform 
kassebaum said the one major difference between republicans 
and democrats is that government must have a limited role 
gov mike hayden of kansas urged the committee to include a 
strong rural plank in the platform 
sometimes policies of the federal government have 
discriminated against rural areas hayden said we have heard 
about urban renewal but seldom have we heard about rural 
revitalization 
the partys 1980 and 1984 platforms the latter particularly 
pleasing to conservatives will serve as a basis for the 1988 
platform said nebraska gov kay orr chairman of the platform 
committee 
its a good base mrs orr said of the 1984 platform but 
times have changed there is a different emphasis that we will 
place on things 
fahrenkopf said the 1984 platform established a base a soul 
for the party 
but times have changed problems have changed fahrenkopf 
said at a news conference held by the seven committee members 
during a lunch break we want to take conservative approaches to 
solve the problems we see coming down the road 
we have had no specific direction from bush mrs orr said 
referring to likely gop presidential nominee george bush we will 
have a line of communication open were very interested in the 
vice presidents views 
as for the partys november opponents fahrenkopf said the 
democrats face a levelwithamerica dilemma do they hide the 
liberal agenda and record of their nominee michael dukakis or do 
they level with americans and detail their liberal goals and 
plans

fallen ptl founder jim bakker returned to 
the heritage usa theme park tuesday and said he would try to buy 
back the ministry if it were liquidated in bankruptcy court 
i would set up offices near here which i probably will do as 
every peice of ministry comes up for sale i would buy it to 
restore it to the people it was meant for bakker said in a break 
in a meeting with ptl attorneys his attorneys and roe messner the 
primary builder of the heritage usa theme park 
i want to see the ministry restored 100 percent bakker 
said adding right now it looks bleak for the ministry 
he said the meeting was to back up messners claims against ptl 
in the bankruptcy proceedings messner next to the internal 
revenue service is the largest single creditor in the ptl 
bankruptcy proceeding 
bakker left ptl after charges of paying off jessica hahn a 
church secretary to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him 
and that was followed by revelations of a lavish lifestyle led by 
jim and tammy bakker 
when he came out of the world outreach center where the meeting 
was being held a group of about a dozen supporters shouted words 
of support and hugged him 
he said after the meeting he would be visiting friends and 
relatives and riding around the grounds of ptl 
bakker said he was there at messners request and charged that 
most of the records he had left behind when he left ptl in march 
1987 have been destroyed 
almost all of the blueprints of all the buildings are 
missing bakker said 
when asked who might have destroyed the records he said any 
of them who might want to take over the ministry 
pressed for further specifics he said i dont know 
asked how he would buy back ptl he said i have a lot of 
friends he again would not provide specifics 
bakker said the meeting did not touch on whether he should come 
back to the ministry but that he would if he were asked 
i think everybody else has had a chance its being sold 
off what would be wrong with giving jim and tammy a chance 
bakker said 
the ministry is in bankruptcy court now with up to 130 million 
in debt and a reorganization plan calling for the sale of much of 
ptls assets is up for final approval by us bankruptcy judge 
rufus reynolds on june 16 in columbia 
before the meeting bakker told reporters he wants to meet with 
new ministry trustee mc red benton to ensure the ministrys 
lifetime partners are given everything theyre owed 
bakker said he would like to meet with charlotte nc 
businessman george shinn shinn owner of the charlotte knights 
minorleague baseball team and the new charlotte hornets of the 
national basketball association is one of the people interested in 
buying heritage usa and he would like to build a baseball stadium 
there 
bakker didnt say how long hed remain in the area but said his 
wife tammy will join him in a few days 
ryan hovis of rock hill another bakker attorney said the 
bakkers have left their home in california and are returning to 
their home in gatlinburg tenn 
bakker is being investigated by a federal grand jury in 
charlotte for possible mail fraud and tax evasion and is involved 
in lawsuits with ptl and his former attorney roy grutman 
david clark who recently stepped down as ptl trustee filed a 
52 million lawsuit in january against bakker his wife and former 
top aide david taggert earlier bakker and taggert sued ptl for 
13 million and 187000 respectively 
in march bakker sued grutman for 10000 for conflict of 
interest 
the bakkers stayed at their former tega cay residence for 
several weeks in june 1987 as they attempted to regain control of 
the ministry from the rev jerry falwell they also returned in 
october 1987 to visit jim bakkers father raleigh who was ill at

a final statement saying the 
communist party can fix the chaotic economy ended a three threeday 
conference tuesday during which delegates castigated party leaders 
and demanded their removal 
many delegates took the floor to accuse the leadership of 
bungling some said the failure to solve severe economic problems 
is destroying public trust in the party 
young people are reluctant to join the communist party because 
they have no confidence in our organization metka tekavcic a 
slovenian delegate declared during debate 
fewer than 10 percent of yugoslavias 23 million people belong 
to the party and the number has been declining rapidly in the 
opening speech of the conference sunday party chief bosko krunic 
rejected calls for a multiparty system 
yugoslavia has a foreign debt of 21 billion europes highest 
annual inflation at 170 percent and an unemployment rate of 15 
percent economic problems have caused increasing social and labor 
unrest 
the 38page final conference document was not made public 
immediately but informants said it did not hold out the prospect 
of a special party congress to replace the leadership as many 
delegates demanded 
tanjug the official news agency said the document declared 
the party is capable of seeking and finding a way out of the 
political and economic crisis 
according to tanjug the document directs competent 
institutions and organs to complete the reform of the economic 
system based on strong orientation toward market economy by the 
end of the year 
on monday and tuesday speakers said party leaders had not 
implemented reforms recommended in resolutions of the 1986 party 
congress and should be replaced if economic problems continue 
congresses are held every four years and have broad powers to 
change communist party rules and personnel but the conferences 
held between them are largely advisory 
boro avramovic of serbia the largest of yugoslavias six 
republics declared tuesday the party needs a general overhaul 
and that process has to start with the presidium politburo of the 
central committee 
many delegates have criticized krunic the party chief and his 
predecessor milanko renovica by name for not pursing reforms 
recommended by the 1986 congress 
it is unlikely that those people who have led us into this 
crisis will be able to bring us out of it said rade milicevic of 
serbia 
luka miletic of zagreb said yugoslavs increasingly insist 
the entire communist leadership be replaced since it had not fired 
officials who impeded radical reform 
the government announced new austerity measures saturday that 
party leaders acknowledged would be unpopular and cause more 
hardship krunic said in his speech sunday that social upheavals 
are certain and may be grave 
included in the new plan are substantial price increases wage 
cuts and currency devaluation one result is likely to be lowering 
the standard of living which already has declined by onethird 
since 1980 
on monday many delegates said a special party congress should 
be held by the end of the year to replace the party leadership 
unless we carry through a complete social reform by next 
autumn it will be necessary to call a special party congress 
said slobodan milosevic the serbian party chief 
several delegates said tuesday however that they opposed a 
special congress and preferred immediate action by the central 
committee 
vilma mancek of slovenia the most industrially developed 
republic said a congress would be a waste of time and money 
those who demand a special congress should have the courage to 
propose the replacement of the party presidium since the central 
committee has the power to recall members of the presidium 
without holding a special congress she said 
party officials have said the situation is not critical enough 
to warrant a special congress

pianist dave brubeck solved another mystery about 
the soviet unions highest official on tuesday night finding out 
that when it comes to jazz mikhail s gorbachev is very into 
it 
im ready to fly to the moon the 67yearold american jazz 
great declared after his quintet played at a dinner president and 
mrs reagan hosted for the gorbachevs 
in an interview before the performance at spaso house the us 
ambassadors residence where the reagans are staying during the 
summit brubeck said he was curious to find out what the general 
secretary and his wife think of american jazz 
he got the answer despite the language barrier 
i cant understand russian but i can understand body 
language said the pianist who added the general secretary 
appeared to be very into it and was seen tapping his foot not 
an easy thing to do to brubecks odd rhythms 
brubecks 36yearold son chris who plays bass guitar and 
trombone in the quintet said he learned from a woman sitting near 
the general secretary that mrs reagan turned to gorbachev at one 
point during the music and asked if he like jazz according to the 
younger brubeck the 57yearold kremlin chief responded i like 
good jazz and this is good jazz 
that puts gorbachev in the ranks of at least one other soviet 
general secretary yuri andropov who was reputed to be a jazz fan 
at the opposite extreme jazz struck a dissonant chord for premier 
nikita khrushchev who said in december 1963 that when i hear 
jazz its as if i had gas on the stomach 
brubeck said that after his groups 15minute performance the 
gorbachevs came up to him all smiles and complimentary 
as for the reagans who last heard brubeck in a feb 21 white 
house performance they couldnt have been kinder 
the pianist said the president a former hollywood actor told 
him at the february performance how much he loved the big bands 
and how much they were a part of american history 
the group began with duke ellingtons take the a train a 
wellknown jazz classic in the soviet union because it is the theme 
song for a daily voice of america shortwave radio jazz program that 
has introduced thousands of soviets to the american art form since 
the 1950s next was someday my prince will come and king for 
a day brubeck wound up with his 1958 standard take five the 
first jazz single ever to go gold 
brubeck said the spaso house audience which included sen 
robert byrd a fiddler from west virginia was more charged 
than any other he had played for in the halls of kings and 
presidents in his 50year career 
brubecks music is well known in the soviet union through voice 
of america broadcasts and imported record albums and tapes he 
toured the soviet union in march and april of last year in a 
critically acclaimed concert series

british doctors have given a third sufferer of 
parkinsons disease brain cells transplanted from an aborted fetus 
a hospital announced tuesday 
a 58yearold woman underwent the surgery may 17 at the midland 
center of neurosurgery and neurology at smethwick in central 
england she was reported to be back home and showing an 
initially good response to the treatment 
the hospital announced the development in a statement by 
neurologist edward hitchcock whose team carried out britains 
first known fetal braincell transplants in march and april 
parkinsons disease is a potentially fatal condition that causes 
gradual loss of muscle control fetal tissue is thought to 
stimulate production of dopamine a brain chemical lacking in 
parkinsons disease 
hitchcocks disclosure last month that he used the experimental 
procedure provoked controversy critics complained it reduced the 
aborted fetus to the status of a human spare part others welcomed 
it as a possible medical breakthrough 
the us department of health and human services has banned 
government scientists from carrying out surgery using tissue from 
aborted fetuses pending study of the ethical legal and medical 
questions involved 
the first documented use of the experimental procedure was 
reported in january when surgeons in mexico city said they 
injected tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two 
parkinsons sufferers last september swedish doctors subsequently 
reported use of the technique with disappointing results 
hitchcock said last month that his team transplanted fetal brain 
cells into a 60yearold woman and a 41yearold man both of whom 
were said to have shown dramatic improvement 
hitchcock said the latest operation was carried out under 
guidelines issued by the british medical association last month

the agriculture department signaled tuesday it 
is prepared to assist farmers in the nations droughtstricken 
heartland by easing curbs on the use of land idled under 
conservation programs 
hay production and cattle grazing on such land will be allowed 
in counties found to be suffering from a natural disaster that 
harms pasture and forage crops the department said 
the statement came amid heightened concern over a drought 
hammering broad stretches of the nations heartland from south 
texas to the canadian border and as far west as idaho thus far 
however no disaster counties have been declared 
the statement from milton hertz administrator of the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service mainly 
outlined possibilities already open to the department it contained 
no new programs 
under the 1985 farm act farmers must devote a specified portion 
of their land to conservation uses if they are to be eligible for 
crop programs that produce federal payments the amount of land 
involved varies from one crop to another for example it is 275 
percent for wheat 
producers also receive payments for placing endangered land in 
the longterm conservation reserve program 
under the law haying and grazing are banned on acreage devoted 
to conservation programs the theory is that farmers already derive 
economic benefit from the land in the form of government payments 
but usda may make exceptions in the case of natural disasters 
in counties found to be suffering from such a disaster hertz 
said haying and grazing will be allowed for any consecutive 
fivemonth period between april 1 and october 1 
he said determination of counties eligible will be made on a 
countybycounty basis 
hertz said no requests from state and county offices will be 
approved if it appears that doing so will adversely effect haying 
operations in the counties involved no hay or forage harvested may 
be sold he added 
a producer may charge a reasonable harvesting fee for 
allowing other farmers to hay and graze on his acreage however 
the department said but it said he may not receive compensation 
for the value of the vegetative matter that is harvested or 
grazed 
hertz noted that a number of steps already have been taken in 
response to rising concern over the drought 
he said producers enrolled in usdas wheat and feed grains 
programs may take part in the 092 disaster program even though 
the march 11 deadline for participation has passed under the 092 
program farmers produce no crop but still receive 92 percent of 
the federal payments they otherwise would get 
he also pointed to two programs under which the government 
provides subsidies to farmers to purchase livestock feed

americas top arms control official lynn 
m hansen said tuesday the united states will keep testing nuclear 
weapons to preserve its nuclear deterrent a senior soviet official 
called such tests immoral 
speaking on the first day of a special fourweek un session on 
disarmament hansen added that the united states will not try to 
pass a un resolution calling for arms cuts by third world nations 
hansen assistant director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said we are not going to come here and 
insist that developing countries somehow change their defense 
priorities for the acquisition of arms 
of course we would like them to spend less money on arms and 
put more money into development of their own countries 
the reagan administration wants to increase arms sales to 
foreign buyers this year to more than 15 billion 33 billion 
more than last year the soviet union is also a major arms supplier 
hansen said if the united states refused to sell to a foreign 
country seeking arms they would go to another country that would 
say yes 
when asked why america keeps testing nuclear weapons he 
replied the security policy of the united states and its allies 
is based upon the concept of deterrence 
and as long as this is the policy which undergirds our 
security and that of the western alliance we will continue to 
test because the requirement exists 
at a separate news conference deputy soviet foreign minister 
vladimir f petrovsky said we decline this strategy and policy 
of nuclear deterrence not only because of practical unusefulness 
but because of the immoral nature of this kind of deterrence 
we think the time is right to stop the nuclear tests 
petrovsky said moscow intends to reduce the number and might 
of nuclear tests conducted during each year and to press for 
adoption of a test ban treaty 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar opened the 
session by noting it began at a most opportune time when 
president ronald reagan and general secretary mikhail gorbachev 
are engaged in a dialogue in moscow partly in the context of the 
reduction of strategic nuclear weapons 
he expressed pleasure over the recent ratification of the 
ussoviet intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty to scrap 
medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
perez de cuellar said it clearly shows that with political 
will agreements to reverse the nucleararms race are possible and 
compliance with them can be duly verified 
he called on the superpowers to take the next step and cut in 
half their longrange nuclear arsenals under a strategic arms 
reduction treaty or start 
petrovsky told reporters the soviets will seek to focus the 
attention of the un disarmament session on the whole range of 
nuclear issues on the nuclear weapons test ban prevention of the 
weapons expansion into outer space the soonest possible 
conclusion of a convention on the ban on chemical weapons as 
well as reducing conventional forces 
the united states wants the session to stress cuts in 
conventional arms 
hansen said the united states does not seek to bring britain and 
france into superpower talks to reduce nuclear arsenals 
moscow would prefer a treaty that would include british and 
french weapons 
hansen said the united states also seeks to balance european 
arms control with progress on human rights issues 
the un general assembly stated in 1979 that the united nations 
should play a central role in disarmament and that complete 
nuclear disarmament was the priority 
no breakthroughs are expected to emerge at this un session 
during which at least 25 presidents and prime ministers are 
scheduled to address the general assembly

that kind of talk was bound to be welcomed by dukakis as he and 
his supporters looked forward to gaining a mathematical lock on the 
nomination in the primaryseason finale next tuesday 
in a weekend interview with the associated press dukakis also 
had said he looked for a convention without the divisiveness that 
some feared 
i think were going to have a good convention dukakis said 
i dont see any deep divisions i dont see anything that 
cant be resolved 
bush his republican nomination long assured met with 
economists at his home at kennebunkport on the maine seacoast 
afterward he said he would reject a call for new taxes even if it 
is recommended by a blueribbon bipartisan commission 
but bush who often says he wants to become the education 
president said higher local school taxes might be needed 
they may have to bush said ninetythree percent of the 
money for education comes from sources other than the federal 
government if its taxes thats where it has to be it isnt 
going to be at the federal level absolutely 
bush urged the federal reserve not to tighten credit too much 
which he said risks shutting down economic growth 
dukakis stuck to his duties as governor of massachusetts 
spending the day at the statehouse in boston he had an evening 
fundraiser in baltimore 
the race for the presidency at a quiet point in the campaign 
season drew a pleased comment from the soviet side at the summit 
in moscow 
soviet government spokesman gennady gerasimov said what we 
like about your campaign is that the sovietamerican relations at 
least as i see it are not an issue everybody agrees both 
candidates agree that you must have normal relations with our 
country we like it 
while jackson said he foresaw no major convention rifts he 
still left open the possibility of a convention floor fight he 
said he expects the issues of his campaign including workers 
pay reduced military spending and the war on drugs to become 
planks in the partys 1988 platform 
jackson also talked about the vice presidential spot on the 
ticket repeating his contention that ive earned consideration 
for the no 2 spot with dukakis if dukakis should win the 
nomination 
the presidential primary season ends tuesday with the heftiest 
delegate prize california and also contests in new jersey 
montana and new mexico 
dukakis was to resume campaigning after flying to california on 
wednesday 
he planned stops in montana and new jersey and a brief visit 
back where it all began in des moines iowa where party caucuses 
in the february cold were the initial delegate event of the season 
dukakis planned a breakfast meeting with supporters pointing toward 
the fall race against bush in the farm state as he crossed the 
country 
dukakis and jackson both said over the memorial day weekend that 
jackson would play a major part in dukakis expected fall campaign 
against bush but both said the nature of that role hadnt yet been 
worked out 
there are 466 democratic delegates at stake in next tuesdays 
primaries enough to put dukakis over the 2081 needed to 
nominate the massachusetts governor can lay claim to more than 
1700 delegates now compared with fewer than 1000 for jackson 
bush was weighing fall campaign strategies with advisers as his 
campaign faced a series of polls showing him trailing dukakis 
nationally 
the vice president acknowledged to reporters his campaign is 
facing a money crunch of sorts that might require him to cut back 
on summer campaign travel the problem is he has nearly reached the 
federal spending limit for the primary campaign 
its expensive to take this show on the road bush said 
bush recently met with embattled attorney general edwin meese 
iii whose problems some republicans say are damaging to bushs 
campaign meese in an interview on cnn on monday night said he 
and bush had talked frankly about the campaign 
meese said if he were to resign now it would harm bush because 
people would say there was something wrong he left open the 
possibility however that he might leave office by the end of 
summer

vice president george bush said 
tuesday he would reject any call for a federal tax increase even 
if one came from a blueribbon bipartisan commission now working on 
ways to trim the huge federal deficit 
however he also said that higher local school taxes might be 
needed to carry out his education policies 
on another economic subject bush cautioned the federal reserve 
board against tightening credit too much saying i dont want to 
see action taken thats going to shut down economic growth 
bush the allbutcertain republican presidential nominee met 
with a group of private economic advisers then spoke with 
reporters in a meeting hall in this oceanside town where he has a 
vacation home 
he said that while he had full confidence in federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan he wanted to voice a word of caution 
the federal reserve in recent weeks has been slightly tightening 
credit in hopes that by nudging up interest rates it can keep 
inflation in check 
bush said there was some expression of concern about recent 
fed actions among the economists during the first day of a twoday 
session 
the group included harvard economist martin s feldstein a 
former chairman of president reagans council of economic advisers 
and stanford economist michael j boskin they are two of bushs 
most frequently consulted economic advisers 
feldstein quit his white house post after his advocacy of tax 
increases to reduce the federal deficit ran afoul of reagan 
administration nonewtaxes policy 
bush said of federal reserve policymakers i think they are 
putting a great emphasis on inflation whether its too much i 
dont know its a tough balancing thing 
in response to a reporters question he said he would reject 
the notion of a tax increase even if it were part of the 
recommendations of the bipartisan commission now at work 
the panel which includes administration appointees as well as 
members appointed by democratic and republican congressional 
leaders was formed earlier this year to seek ways to trim the 
nations massive budget deficit 
it seems to me that commission might well come up with a tax 
increase bush said and ill be saying wait a minute ive 
taken my case to the american people to hold the line on taxes 
the commission which will also gain two new members appointed 
by the presidentelect after the november election is scheduled to 
present its findings in 1989 
i wold be interested in their views but not persuaded if a 
tax increase is included bush said 
however the vice president who has told audiences he wants to 
be the education president and has stressed educational issues 
in his campaign was asked if local school taxing authorites might 
have to increase taxes to carry out some of the stillunspecified 
programs he envisions 
they may have to bush said ninetythree percent of the 
money for education comes from sources other than the federal 
government if its taxes thats where it has to be it isnt 
going to be at the federal level absolutely 
bush is spending a week at his family oceanside retreat in a 
series of meetings with advisers and republican consultants 
the vice president said that there was wide support among the 
economists for his propsal for a flexible freeze on spending to 
reduce the budget deficit 
bushs plan would hold federal spending except for social 
security benefits to the levels of the 1989 budget plus inflation 
individual programs would not have to be frozen however for every 
one that went up another would have to go down by a corresponding 
amount 
bush says such a plan could result in a balanced budget within 
four years 
he said there was some discussion of taxes at tuesdays meeting 
but that he made his position clear from the outset that he opposed 
any form of tax increase 
on other subjects bush 
said he was pleased with how things were going in the 
superpower talks in moscow and did not think that reagan offended 
the soviets by talking too much about human rights i dont believe 
that for a minute 
said that his waitandsee position on attorney general edwin 
meese iii hasnt changed were so close to hearing from that 
independent counsel we ought to get the report and let ed sort all 
that out 
said remarks like a recent comment by democratic national 
chairman paul kirk that he was a country club republican didnt 
bother him listen thats just part of the territory that was 
mild they didnt even lay a glove on me 
bush had said over the weekend that his campaign was running low 
on cash and tht it might have to curtail some travel plans after 
the june 7 california primary 
aide bob teeter said on tuesday that of the 295 million 
raised so far by the campaign including 7 million in federal 
matching funds less than 15 million is left in campaign coffers 
bush has raised the maximum allowed by law for preconvention 
spending

mikhail s gorbachev pronounced the jazz good 
and the rest of moscow society tapped their feet to the distinctly 
american rhythms at president reagans lavish dinner tuesday for 
the soviet leader and his wife 
the superpower leaders exchanged toasts touching on arms issues 
and reagan said the two nations should work together that we 
might forever keep our swords at our sides

their world war ii alliance to the tensions of the cold war era 
when we all felt the breath of impending catastrophe

a uniquely interesting period in the history of our two nations 
and added may the years to come bring a healthier international 
environment 
weightier issues aside the evening was filled with the rhythms 
of jazz great dave brubecks quintet the musician is one of the 
reagans favorite performers jazz which began in the united 
states is heard by thousands of soviets though a daily voice of 
america shortwave radio program and brubeck has toured the country 
in critically acclaimed concert series 
i cant understand russian but i can understand body 
language said brubeck who added that gorbachev appeared to be 
very into it 
brubecks 36yearold son chris who plays bass guitar and 
trombone in the group said he learned from a woman sitting near 
gorbachev that mrs reagan turned to gorbachev at one point during 
the music and asked if he liked jazz according to the younger 
brubeck the kremlin chief responded i like good jazz and this 
is good jazz 
reagan and the 120 guests seemed to enjoy the the lobster 
bisque supreme of chicken with truffle sauce and california wines 
during the dinner party reagan was seated next to the wrong 
man the official seating chart called for aleksandr yakovlev 
secretary of the communist partys central committee to be on 
reagans left while mrs gorbachev was on the other side 
in fact reagans dinner partner was yegor yakovlev editor of 
the moscow news the english language weekly newspaper and a beacon 
of glasnost 
elaine crispen mrs reagans spokeswoman said she did not know

party to olympic gold medalist katya gordeyeva and bolshoi

but gorbachevs daughter irina virganskiy and her husband 
anatoly snubbed the dinner they accepted but they did not 
arrive mrs crispen said the couple did not give a reason for 
their noshow 
the russian guests appeared to appreciate the entertainment and 
many tapped along with their feet as brubecks quintet played 
take the a train take five and some day my prince will 
come 
sakharov a winner of the nobel peace prize told reporters he 
believed the summit was very important as a continuation of 
mutual understanding and achieving trust

a vodka toast in the direction of the press made an extra point of 
greeting sakharov and his wife yelena bonner

the boeing 737 that disintegrated and crashed 
over taiwan in 1981 and another one that lost part of its fuselage 
over hawaii in april were built backtoback but boeing officials 
tuesday attributed any similarities to coincidence 
the 151st 737200 model boeing produced was the far eastern air 
transport jet that broke up at 22000 feet over central taiwan aug 
22 1981 killing all 110 people on board 
no 152 was the aloha airlines aircraft on which a 20foot 
section of forward upper fuselage ripped away at 24000 feet on 
april 28 a flight attendant fell to her death and 61 passengers 
were injured but the flight crew landed the plane safely 
the cause of the aloha accident is still under investigation 
but the federal aviation administration has ordered us airlines 
flying older 737s to reinspect the aircraft including mandatory 
electronic testing of planes with more than 50000 landings 
boeing believes the far eastern crash was caused by maintenance 
problems spokesman jack gamble of boeing commercial airplanes said 
any connection between that crash and the aloha accident are a 
series of coincidences gamble said 
we do not think that is a fair assessment to directly link 
the two he said 
at the time of the planes manufacture in 1969 boeing was 
turning out two or three 737s a month gamble said he said he knew 
of no other problems involving 737s made about that time 
benjamin cosgrove boeing commercial airplanes vice president 
and general manager for engineering was quoted by the wall street 
journal tuesday as saying the consecutive aircraft numbers were 
coincidence 
although both accidents involved the same part of the fuselage 
nothing was inherently wrong with that portion of the aircraft 
cosgrove said 
he told the journal that the taiwanese 737 repeatedly was used 
to ship fish in open containers and corrosive salt water may have 
gotten into the cargo hold the newspaper said far eastern 
officials denied that 
national transportation safety board spokesman michael benson in 
washington dc said tuesday the safety boards investigators 
also believe leaking salt water from fish shipments caused the 
taiwan jets corrosion 
gamble said boeing had issued a series of service bulletins on 
older 737s those included a march 1978 bulletin recommending 
additional inspections of fuselage skins for possible corrosion on 
july 1 1981 the faa issued an airworthiness directive requiring 
us carriers to inspect older 737s 
boeing had supplied kits to airlines to allow them to replace 
corroded skin on planes gamble said 
a kit was delivered to far eastern in april 1980 which means it 
was in the companys spare parts inventory considerably before that 
crash but it apparently was never used on the plane he said 
cosgrove was in washington dc to attend a conference on 
problems with aging aircraft and was unavailable for comment 
tuesday gamble said the faa called the threeday conference after 
the aloha incident to study safety issues involving older aircraft 
one of the faa directives issued after the aloha accident 
focuses on early models of 737s in which boeing used a coldbonding 
process in which structural parts of the fuselage were laminated 
using an adhesive that cured at room temperature 
t craig martin director of public relations for boeing 
commercial airplanes said that about 1971 after the first 291 
models of 737s were built the company changed to a hotbonding 
process that used an adhesive that cured with heat he said the new 
method was a technological improvement over the previous process 
which was more prone to corrosion 
about that time boeing also made a series of changes in 
manufacturing processes and design including strengthening parts 
of the fuselage and making the skin thicker where sections 
overlapped martin said 
the twinengine 737 is the worlds most popular commercial 
aircraft with more than 2000 on order 
martin said he found a number of differences between the two 
accidents the taiwanese plane for example was 12 years old and 
had approximately 33000 landings while the aloha jet was 20 years 
old and had about 90000 landings 
he said that as best we know the far eastern accident was 
caused by corrosion in the planes cargo hold while the aloha 
accident involved the top of the plane 
but again the appropriate thing is to see what the ntsb and 
the faa conclude before drawing all these analogies and 
comparisons martin said

the us supreme court granted a stay of 
execution for condemned georgia death row inmate son h fleming on 
tuesday a day before he was scheduled to die in the states 
electric chair 
the high court granted the stay with no immediate comment 
except to note that chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron white and sandra day oconnor dissented said court 
spokeswoman kathy arberg 
fleming 58 was scheduled to die at 7 pm wednesday for the 
1976 slaying of ray city police chief ed giddens if the stay had 
not been granted he would have been the 99th person put to death 
since the supreme court allowed states to restore the death penalty 
in 1976 georgia has killed 12 people 
giddens was abducted and killed after he stopped a car matching 
the description of one used in a robbery he had pleaded for his 
life and told his captors he planned to retire the next day 
according to trial testimony 
henry willis also received a death sentence for the slaying but 
no execution date has been set a third defendant larry fleming 
nephew of son fleming was sentenced to life in prison 
earlier tuesday flemings family had asked the state board of 
pardons and paroles to block the execution 
son flemings attorney ken shapiro said tuesdays appeal was 
virtually the same as one filed two years ago when fleming came 
within hours of execution the latest petition has a supplement 
containing a statement from flemings son shapiro said 
the earlier appeal raised questions about flemings role in the 
crime and cited three heart attacks fleming has suffered during 12 
years on death row the 11th us circuit court of appeals stayed 
the execution 
parole board chairman wayne snow said after the 40minute closed 
hearing that the board would review the new appeal through the 
afternoon he said the board would consider flemings frail health 
and his relatives arguments 
about 10 members of flemingss family attended the hearing 
including four of his sisters and his younger brother handy 
fleming 
i think he deserves another appeal handy fleming said i 
really dont think he done it 
shapiro said relatives described fleming as a compassionate 
devoted family man who was a father figure for his younger brothers 
and sisters after their father left home 
there remains a question of sons culpability shapiro said 
son has always maintained that he was not the triggerman

portauprince haiti ap soldiers and peasants clashed in 
the hamlet of danti in northwest haiti with a rural law officer 
reported killed and many peasants wounded radio stations in the 
capital said tuesday 
the report coincided with a plea by foreign minister gerard 
latortue on tuesday for international aid for this impoverished 
caribbean nation he told a news conference at puerto ricos 
department of state no democratic process can sustain itself if 
it is not accompanied by economic development 
the united states suspended most of its aid to haiti following 
election violence last november 
section chief leroy ely was killed in danti last thursday 
touching off the clashes which reportedly continued until monday 
section chiefs in haiti are rural police officers with military 
rank responsible for supervising public works as well as 
maintaining law and order under the 29year duvalier family 
dictatorship section chiefs exercised wide powers 
ely traveled to danti to impose the authority of the capital 
city of the section le borgne peasants demanded their hamlet be 
assigned to neighboring gros morne district and in subsequent 
rioting ely was killed 
soldiers came to quell the unrest radio lumiere radio 
metropole and radio haiti inter reported that from thursday to 
monday danti residents were beaten and arrested or forced to flee 
their homes were pillaged and burned 
witnesses interviewed by radio metropole said many people were 
wounded or forced to take flight radio haiti inter said 25 
peasants were arrested 
according to radio metropole danti is in a relatively fertile 
zone and le borgne authorities did not want to lose it 
disputes over land have become common and violent in this arid 
mountainous and overpopulated nation that shares the island of 
hispaniola with the dominican republic 
last july hundreds of peasants clashed with landowners and 
among themselves over property in the northwest village of jean 
rabel dozens were killed 
in asking for foreign help latortue said in san juan puerto 
rico that for us haitians economic development means food 
and water for the great majority of the population and health 
services education and housing 
the united states has been haitis biggest foreign aid donor 
contributing 103 million a year to the poorest nation in the 
western hemisphere with a population of 53 million 
most us aid was suspended following cancellation of last 
novembers national elections because of violence which the 
thenruling junta under lt gen henri namphy did little to curtail 
france and canada maintained their aid commitments to haiti but 
the world bank and the international monetary fund have withheld 
40 million in loans 
latortue who spent 10 years in puerto rico as part of his 
25year exile during the duvalier dictatorships criticized us 
officials for blocking aid to haiti following controversial 
national elections last january 
he asked puerto rico a us commonwealth to make available 
scholarships for haitian students and do what it could to promote 
haitis economic development 
dictator francois duvalier ruled haiti since 1957 his son 
jeanclaude took over at his death but fled feb 7 1986 during a 
popular uprising a president leslie manigat was chosen in 
january

the military government on tuesday 
decreed a 90day extension of the state of emergency opposition 
leaders say the extension will prevent a fair campaign in the 
presidential referendum this year 
in another development interior ministry officials issued a 
list tuesday of 25 political exiles allowed to return home it 
included several prominent figures in the leftist government of 
president salvador allende that was overthrown in september 1973 
more than 4000 exiles have been authorized to return since the 
government began issuing periodic lists early in 1986 but only a 
few hundred have done so human rights groups say 400 exiles still 
are banned the government claims the number is closer to 300 
no date has been set for the presidential referendum in which 
chileans will be allowed only to vote yes or no on a 
single militaryappointed candidate for the 198997 term 
gen augusto pinochet who is 72 and has been president since 
the 1973 military coup is considered the most likely candidate 
if voters reject the governments choice a competitive election 
is to occur a year later with pinochet remaining in office until 
then 
the state of emergency would have expired tuesday 
by renewing the state of emergency the government is casting 
doubt on the fairness of its own plebiscite said patricio 
aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic party the 
largest opposition group 
enrique silva president of the centrist radical party said 
under the state of emergency the most basic guarantees for a 
clean electoral process cannot exist 
government officials have hinted the election might be held 
sept 11 which means the emergency would cover at least part of 
the campaign 
adm jose merino castro the navy chief and member of the ruling 
military junta told reporters after a junta meeting the emergency 
would be lifted 30 days before the referendum 
if the opposition doesnt like it it means the state of 
emergency is good merino said 
genaro arriagada a leading member of a 15party coalition 
organized to promote a no vote in the referendum called 
extending the emergency a gross abuse by the government 
officials claim the emergency is necessary to deal with what the 
government calls a growing terrorist threat from radical leftists 
the roman catholic church and several foreign governments 
including the reagan administration have urged pinochet to lift 
the restrictions before the referendum 
under the emergency which was imposed when the military seized 
power and has been enforced intermittently since the government 
can restrict freedom of the press and ban public gatherings 
it allows authorities to censor mail and prevent citizens from 
entering or leaving the country or traveling freely the emergency 
is enforced by regional military commanders 
on december 17 1987 president reagan declared his support for 
a european economic community statement urging pinochets 
government to lift the restrictions several months before the 
election the eec statement said that was essential for a fair 
campaign

an antipornography group is planning to 
picket videotape retailers who plan to retaliate with boycott 
threats against protesters employers as amendments to the states 
obscenity law take effect 
a group called the minnesota cleanup project plans to protest at 
about 50 videotape stores throughout the state saturday to draw 
attention to provisions taking effect wednesday and to urge local 
officials to enforce it said robert p heinrich director of the 
antipornography organization 
but video store owners are planning a countermove said david 
ballstadt president of adventures in video which operates 10 
videotape stores in the minneapolisst paul area 
in retaliation for this picketing video store operators are 
going to hire private detectives take down license plate numbers 
of people picketing and find out where they are employed 
ballstadt said letters will be sent to the picketers employers 
telling them their products will be boycotted because of their 
employees activities he said 
if these people think they can walk around and express their 
freedoms which they have a right to do theyre going to have to 
pay a price just as we have to ballstadt said 
the legislature approved amendments this year to make the 
states obscenity law conform with us supreme court rulings 
the changes technically are not that great but they do 
provide some tools for prosecutors to use minnesota solicitor 
general norm coleman said 
the previous law provided only for civil penalties and left 
unclear what role prosecutors should play in enforcing it coleman 
said 
the new law provides for criminal penalties which clearly are 
in the purview of county prosecutors he said a first offense is 
considered a gross misdemeanor and carries a penalty of up to one 
year in prison a 3000 fine or both subsequent offenses are

president mengistu haile mariam of 
ethiopia called on tuesday for better relations between his marxist 
government and the united states reminding americans once upon 
a time we were good friends 
the leader of this east african nation also made an impassioned 
defense of ethiopias war in its northern provinces charging that 
the rebels are fighting a proxy war to consolidate arab control of 
the red sea 
in reply to a question mengistu denied that his government was 
using food as a weapon in the north where the war and a big 
government counteroffensive have jeopardized a massive 
westernfinanced relief effort for 32 million ethiopians facing 
starvation in eritrea and tigre provinces 
instead mengistu insisted rebels were using an issue as 
sensitive as a food deficit situation and hunger to elicit 
international sympathy and support for them to promote their 
propaganda activities against us 
mengistu spoke with unusual candor on a wide range of issues 
gesticulating with passion and occasionally smiling and laughing 
during a sixhour news conference with foreign reporters his first 
since may 1986 
for the first time mengistu accused arab states of backing the 
northern secessionist insurgency where rebels have won major 
victories this year by capturing several towns 
rebels of the eritrean peoples liberation front have been 
fighting for 27 years in africas oldest civil war 
mengistu made no reference to the insurgency by rebels of the 
tigrean peoples liberation front who have been fighting for 14 
years for a bigger say in the governing of their province 
mengistu said the us government refused to impose sanctions on 
south africa but was imposing an undeclared embargo on 
ethiopia he said washington was at the verge of cutting the last 
tethers which we have to the united states with congressional 
discussions last week on stopping annual imports of 20000 tons of 
ethiopian coffee 
we are not really pleased with our relations with the united 
states and it is our hope that better times will come in the 
future we want to assure them and i am sincere quite sincere 
about this that we will do our best to improve relations 
mengistu said we have always pushed for better relations with 
the united states and i hope the united states will reciprocate 
once upon a time we were good friends 
he said ethiopians were fond of the american people and admired 
their achivements but relations could improve only if the united 
states accepts us on a basis of equality and respect 
we are really not sure what mistakes we have committed against 
the us government he said adding perhaps it was ethiopias 
choice of socialism that was repugnant to the defender of 
capitalist values 
he said ethiopias marxist revolution of september 1974 had 
improved lives of the countrys 42 million people contrary to 
western news reports he said and to us government insistence on 
categorizing it as communist his government was not an ogre intent 
on filling ethiopias prisons with political dissidents and 
starving its people 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity were 
puzzled by mengistus conciliatory attitude they said ethiopia at 
the last minute caused chester crocker us assistant secretary of 
state for african affairs to cancel a january visit when it 
announced he would not be meeting mengistu 
in february crocker said he believed ethiopia was not serious 
about improving relations with the united states 
oncewarm us relations with ethiopia deteriorated after the 
revolution in which mengistu and a clique of fellow army officers 
overthrew emperor haile selassie 
the united states continued to arm the new military government 
until somalia invaded ethiopias southern ogaden region in 1977 
in a dramatic superpower reversal the soviets switched sides to 
ethiopia and the united states started backing the somalis 
mengistu said tuesday that rebels in ethiopia also had won 
support from progressive countries which the diplomats identified 
as cuba and the soviet union which in the past have helped trained 
eritrean rebels about 2500 cuban troops in ethiopia have refused 
to fight in the north

a federal judge tuesday temporarily enjoined 
the navy from starting tests of a highpowered electrical generator 
designed to simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion 
us district judge john garrett penn after hearing arguments 
from attorneys representing the navy and the foundation on economic 
trends issued a temporary restraining order against the tests 
which were set to begin wednesday 
the restraining order which expires at noon friday was issued 
to give the government time to file a motion striking a paragraph 
from a consent decree the foundation contends prohibits the navy 
from beginning the tests 
navy officials had planned to begin the test wednesday with 
empress ii barge in international waters about 15 miles off the 
virginianorth carolina coast 
the empress ii barge is equipped with two diesel generators and 
a huge antenna system capable of sending pulses of electrical 
power into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to 
test a phenomenon known as electromagnetic pulse or emp 
each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second and the navy 
maintains the testing will have no affect on human or marine life 
electromagnetic pulse is a powerful wave or surge of 
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which 
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water 
emp became a matter of concern to the military in the early 
1960s when the pentagon discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at 
high altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable 
the electronic components used in computers communications and 
guidance equipment 
as a result of that discovery military laboratories have 
studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing 
methods for hardening electronic weapon components to withstand 
emp the navy wants to use the empress ii barge to test its success 
in hardening electronic equipment on warships 
the foundation on economic trends an activist environmental 
group that has long tried to curtail biological weapon research 
sued the defense department in march 1987 with the goal of stopping 
all emp testing until environmental impact studies had been 
performed 
the lawsuit asserted that emp experiments could affect human 
health directly and through the disruption of electronic circuits 
in nuclear power plants automobiles computers airplanes phone 
lines and navigational systems can cause potential catastrophies 
under many possible circumstances 
two weeks ago the pentagon agreed to settle that suit by 
sharply curtailing or shutting down emp research facilities across 
the country until environmental assessments were performed in the 
case of empress ii however the navy argues it already has 
performed the necessary environmental study and thus can proceed 
with testing 
the foundation acknowledges the navy has finished one 
environmental study but says the recent settlement clearly 
envisioned the navy performing a second study because the first 
focused on the effect of emp testing in the chesapeake bay not the 
atlantic ocean 
congress prohibited emp testing in the chesapeake 
the us navy has violated the settlement asserted jeremy 
rifkin the president of the foundation 
our attorneys questioned them on this before we finalized the 
settlement they cant claim now that the first impact study is 
sufficient and if congress says its too dangerous for the bay 
why should the waters off north carolina be treated differently 
penns ruling gives the navy time to file a motion to strike the 
paragraph in the consent decree that rifkin contends prohibits the 
test

researchers studying four aidsinfected men who 
appeared to stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease 
confirmed the finding tuesday and said the virus may have stopped 
reproducing in those patients 
tests to pinpoint aids and protect blood supplies are based upon 
detection of the antibodies produced naturally by the body to fight 
the virus but homayoon farzadegan and alfred j saah both 
professors of epidemiology at the johns hopkins school of public 
health said their findings do not imply increased dangers of blood 
supply contamination 
i dont think the risk to the blood supply is any different 
today than it was yesterday said saah during a news conference 
the instances of aids victims who stop producing detectable 
antibodies to the disease are very very rare and so far have 
only been observed in those who show small amounts of the virus 
present in their bodies saah said 
four of 1000 homosexual men who participated in the 
researchers continuing study showed the loss of antibodies up to 
3 years ago and continue to test negative 
usually when an infected person loses hiv1 antibodies he or 
she is in the end stages of aids and has a deteriorated immune 
system said b frank polk also a professor of epidemiology at 
the school and coauthor of a report on the study 
but the four men had no clinical symptoms of illness such as 
swollen lymph glands or abnormal counts of the white blood cells 
targeted by the virus he added 
the researchers reported their findings in june 1987 but could 
not determine whether the men were properly diagnosed as having 
aids initially and whether mistakes had been made in laboratory 
tests 
during followup the researchers used a new method to test for 
the virus rather than the antibody and have determined that the men 
show evidence of infection but not antibodies to the aids virus 
the new test called polymerase chain reaction assay or pcr 
magnifies the presence of the virus genetic material up to 1 
million times 
farzadegan speculated that the virus may go into a latent phase 
during which it does not reproduce 
we dont know if something in the virus itself is defective 
and causing it not to reproduce or whether it is something within 
the host saah said adding that researchers have not determined 
whether the disease is transmissible during this phase 
aids is caused by a virus that attacks the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to fatal infections and cancers it is 
most often transmitted by sexual contact or by drug abusers sharing 
contaminated hypodermic needles and syringes 
all of the men who participated in the initial report are 
participants in the multicenter aids cohort study macs that 
follows nearly 5000 homosexual and bisexual men in baltimore los 
angeles chicago and pittsburgh to document the natural progression 
of aids 
the latest findings are to be published in the june 1 issue of 
annals of internal medicine

advocates for the mentally retarded said 
tuesday that executing the mentally retarded even those convicted 
of first degree murder is cruel and unusual punishment and urged 
lawmakers nationwide to outlaw the practice 
it has been our experience that even the foremost proponents 
of the dealth penalty draw the line at young children and people 
with mental retardation said james w ellis presidentelect of 
the american association on mental retardation 
states which have the death penalty in our view must pass 
laws that make it unlawful to execute someone who is mentally 
retarded or to sentence to death someone who is mentally 
retarded said ellis 
ellis announced the organizations resolution calling for a ban 
on the death penalty for the retarded at a press conference during 
the groups annual conference citing a recently passed georgia law 
that allows for a plea of guilty but mentally retarded 
ellis a law professor at the university of new mexico at 
albuquerque said the georgia law requires a psychological 
examination for defendants who wished to enter the plea 
individuals convicted under the law could be sentenced to life 
imprisonment but not executed he said 
ellis also noted that most of the members of the georgia 
assembly are strong supporters of capital punishment 
the georgia law which becomes effective july 1 was prompted by 
widespread criticism of the june 24 1986 execution of mentally 
retarded convicted murderer jerome bowden 
this position that the mentally retarded should never be 
sentenced to death or executed leaves the whole array of the 
criminal justice system left to deal with in any way that seems 
most appropriate said richard h burr of the naacp legal defense 
and educational fund inc which has handled several capital 
punishment cases involving the mentally retarded 
according to figures compiled by burrs group at least 13 
percent of the 66 persons executed since capital punishment was 
reinstated in 1976 had been diagnosed as mentally retarded 
burr also noted that while blacks comprise 40 percent of the 
general prison population 80 percent of all mentally retarded 
prisoners are black or hispanic 
both men agreed that initial determination of a defendants 
mental capacity was vital to correcting the problem they urged 
states to follow the example of texas which routinely tests its 
prison inmates for mental deficiencies 
we need to address the needs of criminal offenders or criminal 
defendants from the very begining when confessions are sought when 
waivers of rights are sought ellis said he noted the need to 
educate members of the criminal justice system about mental 
retardation to make sure justice is done in cases involving the 
mentally retarded 
but burr cautioned that even with these procedures in place a 
number of mentally retarded defendants may be deemed competent to 
stand trail or educated sufficiently to become compenent to stand 
trial and could be convicted to face possible execution 
burr noted that there were several cases currently in the court 
system in which a retarded individual sits on death row he cited 
the case of limmie arthur 28 of south carolina who was convicted 
in the ax murder of a crippled neighbor in 1985 
burr said the courts should be to asked decide whether executing 
arthur whom he said has the mind of a 10 or 12year old would 
constitute a violation of the 8th amendments prohibition of cruel 
and unusual punishment

any student who assaults a teacher will be 
expelled and school security will be beefed up officials decided 
tuesday after a rash of attacks on teachers 
the notion you have a right to free education is assumed 
chancellor richard green said students who violate that right by 
assaulting teachers or any other school personnel will forfeit that 
right for the rest of the school year 
he said students who engage in anything beyond a normal fight 
will find themselves without a public education in new york city 
previously students were suspended or transferred to other 
schools 
the decision came after green met with mayor edward i koch the 
citys district attorneys and the police commissioner about 
violence in the schools 
koch said security measures at the schools will include metal 
detectors electromagnetic locks listening devices and more police 
he added later that the city was researching whether it needs 
action by the state legislature to permit expulsions 
just hours after the announcement a bronx teacher was grazed in 
the leg by a stray bullet as she left her school but the police 
said the shooter apparently was not a student 
the recent incidents include an attack with a baseball bat 
against one teacher and the injury of another who was burned when 
she picked up a firecracker tossed into her classroom 
board of education spokesman frank sabrino said the number of 
serious incidents such as assault robbery sex crimes weapons 
possession and drug violations is running about 10 percent ahead 
of the 3528 reported during the last school year from july 1 to 
april 30 969 assaults included 198 against teachers he said 
koch said at a city hall news conference that the expulsion 
policy was the first and most important action that came out of 
the meeting of the officials 
police commissioner benjamin ward said more police will be 
assigned to patrol at schools where needed 
we are committed to covering those schools at the beginning of 
the school day and at the end of the school day he said 
he estimated that about 200 of the systems 932 schools will 
have police officers assigned at least until the end of the school 
year 
koch also said the officials agreed to ask the legislature for 
a change in the existing law so as to make it a felony if there is 
an attack upon a public official teachers others in the 
performance of their duties 
bronx district attorney paul gentile said he was for greater 
punishment of school thugs 
sandra feldman president of the united federation of teachers 
said she was satisfied at the outcome of the officials meeting 
were going to be watching it very carefully to make sure 
these commitments are carried out she said

prosecutors say a couple who went 
on trial tuesday for allegedly plotting to dismember their 
soninlaw and his family wanted color photos and body parts to 
restore the honor they lost when their daughter married against 
their will 
the alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt but saud 
and ghada tarawneh of toledo ohio were accused of murder 
conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder the tarawnehs were 
arrested in february in toledo 
the defense contends the threats of death and dismemberment were 
arabic overstatement in an attempt to frighten their daughter who 
was living in tamarac 
attorneys were scheduled to deliver opening statements 
wednesday before a jury was selected tuesday defense attorney 
barry roderman sought to suppress tapes of the couple talking to a 
police informer district judge russell seay denied the motion 
preparing for trial i read a book called the arab mind and 
the contention there is that the arab mind does a lot of barking 
but very little biting roderman said outside the courtroom i 
dont mean to say that to start an international feud but i think 
again if you listen to the tapes when theyre played youre going 
to get a different perspective on the case 
prosecutors also agree there is a cultural element in the case 
the pride of the bedouin tribe the tarawnehs belonged to but they 
consider the plot deadly serious 
keeping body parts as souvenirs i dont think is normal 
said assistant state attorney william dimitrouleas 
the couple left jordan 18 years ago and moved to toledo when 
their daughter married her syrian cousin in 1986 over their 
objections and moved to tamarac tradition required the insult be 
avenged 
by tradition the head of a family who loses his honor is no 
longer a man and his family shares that disgrace 
tarawneh 46 a gynecologist who became a us citizen in 1980 
and his wife ghada 44 a nurse already had arranged a marriage 
for their 17yearold daughter raniah and refused to allow her to 
marry mouataz abdulsalam now 28 
when raniah left jordan with her new husband the family wanted 
to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring according

former presidents daniel oduber of 
costa rica and carlos andres perez of venezuela said they offered 
to mediate a solution to the crisis in panama at a meeting tuesday 
with gen manuel antonio noriega 
they told reporters they met noriega who as head of the defense 
forces is the effective leader of panama for two hours at tocumen 
a panamanian air force base near the capital 
acting chief executive manuel palma solis also attended 
andres perez told reporters we came to offer our good offices 
to try to find a solution to the problem we are doing this as 
latin americans because we are worried 
both former presidents are involved in the effort launched this 
week by president oscar arias of costa rica to solve the crisis 
over noriega who is under indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking and money laundering charges and under pressure from 
the reagan administration to quit 
noreiga has refused to step down negotiations by a state 
department envoy and noriega representatives to have him resign if 
the indictments are dropped have failed to budge the general 
us economic sanctions including the freezing of panamanian 
funds in the united states have also failed to move him 
andres perez and oduber said their mission could be divided into 
two parts to achieve a dialogue between the government and the 
opposition and to resolve the confrontation between the united 
states and the government controlled by noriega 
that was the object of our conversation here andres perez 
added 
the meeting took place behind closed doors in a lounge at the 
air base a few minutes after perez and oduber arrived 
details of their mission have not been made public 
the man regarded as noriegas figurehead president eric arturo 
delvalle fired the general shortly after grand juries in florida 
returned the drugrelated indictments in february 
but noriega had his handpicked legislature fire delvalle from 
his presidents job instead and appoint palma solis the 
education minister in delvalles place with the title of acting 
chief executive 
since then delvalle has been in hiding somewhere in panama 
the united states still recognizes him as panamas legitimate 
president

another family friend who asked not to be identified told the 
patriot ledger of quincy that kennedy family members also were 
upset they really are dismayed with this its such a poor idea 
that i just dont believe they want to discuss it 
dallas officials say thousands of tourists come to the building 
every year but cannot gain access to the sixthfloor because it is 
closed the rest of the building houses government offices 
lindalyn adams president of the dallas county historical

including news clippings about the nov 22 1963 assassination and 
the worlds reaction to it

charges that he participated in a 1 million scheme to sell a 
submachine gun design to iran officials said tuesday 
jerry hyatt president of air cargo marketing in wenham mass 
was released on bail tuesday four days after he was arrested in a 
hearing friday before us magistrate patti saris in boston he was 
charged with conspiracy to export weapons to the iranian government

designer oleg cassini won a 16 million award 
tuesday from a federal court jury that found in his favor against 
fragrance maker jovan inc in a breach of contract suit 
the sixmember civil jury took just three hours to find in 
cassinis favor against jovan and its former president richard e 
meyer 
cassini 75 who designed clothes for jacqueline kennedy onassis 
when she was first lady claimed jovan and meyer violated a 1978 
contract to make and market a fragrance line for men and women 
under cassinis name 
in testimony during the fourweek trial before us district 
judge john f keenan cassini complained that jovan was selling the 
perfume in discount stores like k mart instead of limiting sales to 
fashionable department stores like bloomingdales 
cassini sued in 1984 for 24 million accusing jovan now known 
as beecham cosmetics inc of breach of contract he also sued 
jovan and meyer for fraud 
the jury awarded cassini 10 million on the breach of contract 
claim against the company 1 million on the fraud claim against 
the company and 5 million on the fraud claim against meyer 
after the verdict defense lawyers moved for a new trial but 
keenan did not immediately rule on the request

with a long history of revolvingdoor 
regimes it is a rarity for bolivians to see the governments they 
elected in the 1980s hold on for as long as they have they are 
beginning to take notice 
no longer do they repeat the old saying be careful here in 
bolivia you go to sleep with one government and wake up with 
another 
bolivians today are seeing the longest uninterrupted period of 
elected rule in more than two decades and officials talk of a new 
bolivia 
in bolivia there is a new nation in which a new generation 
has consolidated democracy with great effort finance minister 
juan cariaga said in an interview 
the country he added has achieved an important level of 
maturity 
since its founding in 1825 the presidency has changed hands 76 
times an average of once every 26 months 
from 1977 to 1982 bolivia had 10 governments eight of which 
were led by rightwing military leaders who either seized power in 
a coup or inherited it from another military ruler 
in 1982 severe economic problems forced the armed forces to 
allow elections and hand over power to hernan siles zuazo the 
civilian who won the presidency 
he was succeeded after elections in 1985 by victor paz 
estenssoro 80 paz estenssoros term ends in may 1989 and already 
bolivians are preparing for that election 
the last time the country enjoyed such a lengthy period of 
elected rule was 195264 when paz estenssoro also was president 
the profound economic crisis led the people to remove the 
military who bear major responsibility for the countrys political 
and economic instability said simon reyes executive secretary 
of the bolivian workers central and first secretary of the 
communist party 
siles zuazo also was elected in 1980 but prevented from taking 
office by a military coup when he finally assumed the presidency 
two years later his leftofcenter government inherited a bankrupt 
economy and widespread social unrest 
he quickly established authority over the armed forces 
discharging officers who participated in defacto governments and 
prosecuting some who were involved in cocaine trafficking 
labor unions suppressed during military rule rose up with 
appeals for wage increases and improved benefits when their 
demands werent promptly met they staged widespread strikes 
roadblocks and protest marches 
but despite that unrest the citizenry rejected the notion of 
another coup 
in the middle of his term siles zuazo was kidnapped by a group 
of civilians backed by police and military officers but the 
takeover bid was firmly rejected by labor and political groups and 
ended in failure the same day it began 
with the economy still souring the governing leftist coalition 
agreed to move up elections under pressure from congress and trade 
unions in 1985 reyes whose communist party participated in the 
coalition said the coalition had feared military intervention 
paz estenssoro in replacing siles zuazo faced widespread labor 
unrest and a worldrecord inflation rate of 24000 percent a year 
but he brought with him a reputation as one of south americas most 
able elder statesmen and the experience of three previous terms as 
president 
he enacted a series of belttightening measures including a 
currency devaluation of 95 percent a tenfold increase in gasoline 
prices and the elimination of consumer price supports 
the measures set off a general strike by the unions but he 
declared a state of siege and called out the troops who this time 
backed his elected government 
inflation fell to about 10 percent a year and signs of economic 
stability have quelled social unrest somewhat 
when asked most bolivians say it is a strong more deliberate 
citizenry and not a weakened military that is responsible for the 
countrys political renaissance 
there has been a learning process about living in a 
democracy said herbert muller an economist and former central 
bank president under siles zuazo with the return to democracy 
there was a realization of the serious of the problems facing the 
country and of the need to find political solutions through 
dialogue

new oil finds and a 3 billionrailway 
built against the advice of western donors hold out the promise for 
even greater prosperity for this nation of just 12 million people 
among africas wealthiest 
the railway which has become the centerpiece of president omar 
bongos 20 years in office runs 396 miles from this atlantic port 
near libreville through the onceimpenetrable forest of bees to a 
mining center near franceville there it will soon begin regularly 
hauling out more manganese uranium and timber to increase gabons 
export revenues 
full operation of the railroad awaits the expansion of port 
facilities in owendo 
adding to the prospect of increased exports are the new oil 
discoveries 
the outlook now is that gabon whose future not long ago had 
been pictured as gloomy will be adding to the prosperity that has 
raised its annual per capita income to 3000 in contrast to 790 
in nearby nigeria 500 in neighboring congo 802 in cameroon and 
310 in the central african republic 
twice in this decade gabons oil reserves were reported to be 
running out but both times fresh discoveries were made 
the second major find the onshore rabikounga field is a 
giant field the biggest in west africa said david norman 
director of tennecos gabon operations 
gabon has oil reserves estimated at 1 billion barrels but 
norman predicted they will double 
production now is 176000 to 180000 barrels a day from offshore 
fields norman said rabikounga production wont begin before the 
middle of 1989 when it is initially expected to provide 80000 
barrels daily 
the fall in the price of oil early this decade had left gabon 
unable to pay its bills but western creditors have rescheduled 
much of its 2 billiondebt until rabikounga money starts flowing 
at the same time bongo slashed government spending by 50 
percent and cut civil servant salaries private employees were 
required to lend the government 3 percent of their salaries over an 
18month period 
you know how the human situation is said jean ping bongos 
chief of staff because we had the reputation of being the 
richest country in africa our economic problems received much 
attention but we are still in a very very good situation when you 
compare us with others 
the countrys minimum wage of 200 a month has attracted more 
than 180000 people from other african countries to work in gabon 
which is about the size of colorado 
the united states looks favorably upon gabon 
despite current difficulties gabons oil resources relative 
prosperity economic and political orientation and good ties with 
the united states make it an attractive partner for american 
businesses says the latest us embassy economic report on gabon 
the new railroad is seen as a boon for exports 
before the railway the only transport between libreville the 
capital and the mining region was by air traveling by car or 
truck could take 40 days because roads often are washed out by 
heavy rains 
the world bank refused to finance the railway project which 
began in 1973 saying it was too difficult too expensive and would 
never pay for itself 
bongo pushed ahead with private financing and it opened dec 
31 1986 
ping said some of the projects undertaken by the government can 
be questioned but not the railway 
people sometimes dont understand the importance of the 
railway he added before independence from france in 1960 
the country was like three separate bodies how can you build a 
nation if you dont have the feeling of belonging to a community 
countries start with railways 
bongo created a oneparty state 20 years ago but ping said the 
decision was the right one 
we obliged the president to create a oneparty government 
because we are building a nation our objective was national 
unity he said 
bongo was 31 years old and the vice president when he moved up 
to the presidency nov 28 1967 on the death of president leon 
mba 
three months later bongo created the gabon democratic party as 
the nations sole political party on grounds that the previous 
multiparty system had resulted in violent political campaigns and 
one coup attempt that failed only after french intervention 
the us embassys human rights report on gabon says that 
although no criticism of the president is allowed and advocacy of a 
multiparty state is banned the presidents power is limited by 
the diffusion of power through 45 cabinet level officials 
this group of 45 includes representatives of all the countrys 
major ethnic groups geographic and political groups through this 
mechanism gabons varied interest groups are heard given access 
to political patronage and consulted on national resource 
distribution 
on may 3 the government television resumed a program in which 
cabinet ministers appear weekly and take questions from journalists 
and telephone callers 
during a previous run of the show bongo himself was known to 
call in and ask questions

after just one season on nbcs la law 
blair underwood has carved out a tidy niche for himself in the hit 
shows ensemble cast as brash young attorney jonathan rollins 
i couldnt ask for anything better and thats an 
understatement said underwood to be out of college three 
years and to have a job and working as an actor is part of it and 
then working with scripts like the quality of la law i mean 
working with the cast 
these actors all of them will give you something to play off 
of and i think that shows on camera and then the icing on the 
cake is that the public and critics alike enjoy the show 
underwood 23 was in town recently to pick up a belated fine 
arts degree from carnegie mellon university 
he joined the cast of the highrated emmywinning series last 
season as a sophisticate fresh out of harvard law whose 
megaambition occasionally pushes him across the lines of decorum 
and even ethics 
hes been real well received said rick wallace the shows 
coexecutive producer he seemed to fit in there didnt seem to 
be any difficulty making him a part of the ensemble 
underwood looking very unlawyerlike in a gold chain striped 
shirt and pleated trousers said thats one of the main differences 
between himself and the part he plays 
the difference between someone like jonathan rollins and 
myself is jonathan has a type of arrogance and extreme confidence 
in himself and thats it period i think its a difference 
between that and having faith and confidence that you can 
accomplish what you believe in he said 
his fast track to stardom is testimony to that kind of deep 
belief 
inspired by his older brothers interest in acting underwood 
began performing at dinner theaters while in junior high school he 
entered carnegie mellons prestigious drama department in the fall 
of 1982 as a musical theater major but dropped out midway through 
his junior year 
at the time money was kind of tight being independent like i 
am i figured i might as well go out and try to make some money 
just take the chance he said 
armed with publicity photos underwood went to new york in 
january 1985 his first monday there he called his former dance 
instructor in new jersey who set up a meeting that day with an 
agent 
the agent told underwood she was looking for someone to play 
denises boyfriend on nbcs the cosby show underwood 
auditioned and two days later got the part 
wednesday was my first full day living in new york and were 
taping the cosby show on thursday he said friday was the 
big shock here i was i had just done the cosby show coming 
from that high i said what do i do now and thats whan i started 
pounding the pavement knocking on doors 
underwood quickly landed roles in the rap film krush groove 
with sheila e and on the abc soap opera one life to live in 
1986 he was cast as a streetwise parolee in the cbs series 
downtown 
the show was canceled after 13 episodes and for the first time 
in his short career underwood was unemployed 
underwood did a few guest shows then auditioned last summer for 
la law the shows producers including executive producer 
stephen bochco a carnegie mellon alumnus decided to add a black 
attorney to the cast at viewers request 
i dont feel as if he is window dressing because they are 
creating a full fleshedout character who happens to be black 
underwood said as opposed to writing a black character whos 
going to say yo yo yo were gonna go to court now you know 
stereotype 
with the role have come attention and fame including being 
named by a popular magazine as one of americas sexiest bachelors 
his family strives through constant contact to keep him humble 
however said underwood even though he lives in los angeles and 
his parents are in petersburg va theyre on the phone almost 
daily 
his father frank sr 56 a retired army colonel serves as his 
manager his brother frank jr 26 an 
artistslashwriterslashactor has written an 
adventureaction story underwood hopes to produce 
certainly we see him as being a successful actor who has 
gained certain heightened visibility his father said but we 
also see him and accept him and deal with him as a family member 
in every sense his son agreed bursting into laughter

will the best musical be a big british 
blockbuster based on a variation of beauty and the beast or a 
dark fairy tale where happily ever after never comes 
will the best play be a savage comedy about two movie moguls in 
the making or a haunting tale about the children of slaves coming 
to terms with the past or a bizarre love story involving a french 
diplomat and a chinese opera singer of indeterminate sex 
the competition for the 1988 tony awards reflects the fact that 
artistically this was broadways best season in several years and 
more importantly for the new york theater industry all the shows 
nominated for best play and best musical are still running 
the awards show to be televised sunday june 5 at 9 pm edt on 
cbs should be a giant advertisement for broadway 
there are a number of strong candidates in almost every 
category particularly musical with the phantom of the opera 
into the woods and a revival of cole porters anything goes 
each getting 10 nominations 
the battle between the phantom of the opera the english 
extravaganza by andrew lloyd webber and into the woods an 
american challenger written by stephen sondheim and james lapine 
holds the most interest 
the best play competition is also spirited the nominees are 
m butterfly by david henry hwang speedtheplow by david 
mamet joe turners come and gone by august wilson and a walk 
in the woods by lee blessing 
more than any other theater award the tony has always helped a 
show where it counts at the box office joe turner and a 
walk in the woods are doing marginal business and will need the 
prize to survive the summer only speedtheplow has done 
exceptional business and much of that has been because of one of 
its costars pop singer madonna 
into the woods already has picked up best musical awards 
from the new york drama critics circle and the drama desk two 
other theater organizations but dont count phantom out it is 
the biggest success of the season at least in financial terms and 
tony voters usually go for the money the other shows up for best 
musical are sarafina a south african musical and romance 
romance a small evening of two oneact musicals 
if any award would appear to be a shooin the prize for best 
actor in a musical would seem to be locked up by michael crawford 
who plays the title role in the phantom of the opera even 
critics who panned the musical had high praise for crawfords 
portrayal of the deformed composer who lurks in the shadows of the 
paris opera house his competitors include scott bakula romance 
romance david carroll of chess and howard mcgillin 
anything goes 
patti lupone mcgillins costar in anything goes is the 
favorite for the best actress in a musical award her biggest 
competition is joanna gleason who plays the bakers wife in into 
the woods the other nominees are alison fraser of romance 
romance and judy kuhn of chess 
the best actor category is the most competitive in several 
seasons the category was so crowded that several promising 
candidates didnt even get nominated including john malkovich who 
gave a bravura performance in lanford wilsons burn this 
the choices are ron silver one of those wouldbe film producers 
in speedtheplow john lithgow the bewildered diplomat in 
m butterfly derek jacobi a tortured mathematical genius in 
breaking the code and robert prosky a soviet arms negotiator 
in a walk in the woods 
there werent many good roles for women on broadway this season 
joan allen should win the best actress award for her portrait of a 
ballet dancer in burnthis others nominated are glenda jackson 
macbeth blythe danner a streetcar named desire and 
frances mcdormand a streetcar named desire 
joe turners come and gone dominates the featured actress 
category three of its performers kimberleigh aarn l scott 
caldwell and kimberly scott were nominated in that category 
their competition is kate nelligan who appeared in the shortlived 
british satire serious money the winner is a tossup 
bd wong as the exotic opera singer in m butterfly is the 
favorite to take the featured actor award he goes against michael 
gough breaking the code lou liberatore burn this and 
delroy lindo joe turners come and gone 
phantom is expected to dominate the technical awards for 
sets costumes and lighting if it does maria bjornson could walk 
off with two tonys one for scenery and the other for costumes for 
the lavish musical 
don mischer executive producer of the tony awards television

financial shortfalls may force 
argentina latin americas leading user of nuclear power to halt 
construction on a third nuclear reactor and a heavywater plant 
its top nuclear official says 
plans are being made to stop work on the nuclear reactor atucha 
ii which is 60 percent completed and arroyito 90 percent 
finished unless financing is obtained or the government agrees to 
a 800 million budget request said emma perez ferreira president 
of the national atomic energy commission 
well have to stop work on the big ones first if we dont get 
enough money or obtain financing for the projects ms perez 
ferreira argentinas topranking female government official said 
in a recent interview 
a shutdown could hurt argentinas nuclear industry which is the 
most advanced in the western hemisphere outside the united states 
and canada and cut into its future sales of surplus heavy water 
argentina has a contract to build a 100million 10megawatt 
nuclear reactor outside lima peru it also has contracts to build 
a nuclear reactor in algeria and to provide enriched uranium for a 
small experimental nuclear reactor at irans tehran university ms 
perez ferreira said 
argentinas nuclear technicians have mastered the entire fuel 
cycle which gives them the ability to make nuclear weapons but 
officials from president raul alfonsin on down deny this is in 
their plans 
at one time the nuclear program was closely tied to the armed 
forces in particular the navy an admiral headed the atomic energy 
commission until the early 1980s and some reports at the time said 
the military favored building an atomic bomb 
argentina mines its own uranium ore in the andes it prepares 
its own fuel and is capable of enriching the fuel making fuel 
elements running nuclear reactors and reprocessing the fuel 
enriching and reprocessing fuel are the keys to making nuclear 
weapons 
argentina the worlds eighthlargest country geographically 
has two existing nuclear power plants until its economic crisis 
worsened last year it had dreams of building four power plants by 
the end of the century 
theres no sense in talking now even about a fourth nuclear 
plant ms perez ferreira said argentina also has an 
uraniumenrichment plant six research reactors and two 
reprocessing plants 
the nuclear program is important to argentina providing up to 
20 percent of its electrical power and is a source of pride to a 
country whose standard of living has declined steadily since the 
1950s 
but now argentina is the developing worlds thirdlargest debtor 
behind brazil and mexico owing 55 billion it also has a 247 
percent inflation rate in addition to other severe economic 
problems including a loss of real wages for workers 
indeed 22 percent of atomic energy commissions 6500member 
work force have left their jobs since 1983 many for similar posts 
offering double their pay in switzerland brazil and the united 
states ms perez ferreira said 
neighboring brazil has a nuclearpower program but its sole 
plant near rio de janeiro has had constant troubles plans to build 
two other nuclear plants have been set aside for the time being 
ms perez ferreira a 52yearold nuclear physicist took over 
the commission last year when her predecessor quit over budgetary 
disputes with the government as head of commission she reports 
directly to president alfonsin 
although officials deny any plans for nuclear weapons argentina 
has yet to sign the international nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
it opposes the treaty on grounds that it interferes with 
national sovereignty the other nonsignatory nations with nuclear 
technology are south africa israel india pakistan and brazil 
accidents at argentine nuclear facilities have left three 
technicians dead since 1982 but experts say argentina is not 
considered unsafe a radioactive water spill and a burst pipe also 
briefly shut down atucha i and the embalse plant last year and in 
may 
national reliance on nucleargenerated power became apparent in 
april when power shortages caused in part by temporary shutdowns of 
atucha i and embalse forced emergency power cutoffs in buenos 
aires mar del plata and other major cities 
argentinas nuclear interest stems from 1950 during the first 
presidency of juan d peron its first power plant was atucha i a 
335megawatt facility built with west german technology in 1974 
the second embalse outside cordoba in northcentral argentina 
was finished in 1983 built with canadian technology it has 600 
megawatts of power equal to the connecticut yankee plant in the 
united states 
atucha ii if it is completed will have 745 megawatts

some of the betrothed want to cover two special dates they plan 
to marry on aug 8 but delay the wedding dinner until sept 18 
which in the lunar year coincides with the eighth day of the 
eighth moon 
sept 18 was fully booked in november last year said 
jessica eng of the cathay restaurant 
millions in singapore hong kong taiwan malaysia and other 
parts of asia hold a deep respect for what they perceive as the 
power of certain numbers particularly older people whose beliefs 
are strongly influenced by the traditions of china 
while 13 is unlucky to westerners the number four alone or in 
a combination such as 24 or 44 is bad news for many chinese 
because in cantonese it sounds like the word for dying 
numbers affect many things municipal officials say they receive 
about 10 written and many oral requests each year from people who 
want to change house numbers because the ones they have are unlucky 
applicants get a standard reply no change is possible as this 
will result in a haphazard system abuse and impropriety 
real estate agents say that if chinese have a choice when buying 
or renting property they generally shun houses or apartments with 
the number four some developers offer discounts when selling 
condominiums with unlucky numbers especially if the market is 
sluggish 
the auctioning of license plates with lucky numbers fetched the 
equivalent of about 1 million in singapore dollars in the last 
three years for the registry of vehicles plates with multiple 
number eights are special favorites 
if aug 8 1988 was not auspicious enough this is also the year 
of the dragon in the chinese astrological cycle following a rabbit 
year in the 12year zodiac the dragon is considered a mighty 
creature that bestows blessings 
a spokesman for the population planning unit said it expects an 
increase in births this year children who will be known as dragon 
seeds 
not everyone agrees that popular dates have much to do with 
custom or traditional belief 
the couples have departed completely from the chinese almanac 
in choosing these dates said lee siow mong a retired educator 
and president of the china society the traditional way is to 
pick the proper date and time according to the almanac 
personally i think all this talk about 8888 being lucky is 
very stupid and baseless lee said in an interview with the 
straits times newspaper 
nevertheless maggie tay who was told that all the registry of 
marriage slots were taken on aug 8 still wants to go by the 
numbers 
it is a special day that comes along only once in a hundred 
years she said adding that she was considering new years day 
as an alternative 
yat yat paat kow 1189 sounds like everyday prosper 
forever

they keep crossing the river said 
mario trejo in ciudad juarez on the rio grande 
he was talking about mexican laborers and how the new us 
immigration law wasnt stopping them from illegally crossing the 
border to work in the united states 
and people still are coming from the central and south of 
mexico hoping to go to the other side trejo said on the 
telephone he is the press chief for mayor jaime bermudez in ciudad 
juarez on the other side of the rio grande from el paso texas 
he and other mexican authorities believe the unwritten law of 
supply and demand is winning out over the 1986 us immigration 
reform and control act also known as the simpsonrodino law even 
though jobs are going begging in northern mexico 
the undocumented migrants continue entering the united states 
as if there never had been a simpsonrodino law jorge 
bustamante director of the tijuanabased northern border college 
and a leading critic of the immigration law wrote in a recent 
newspaper column 
the laws supporters say its intent is to help the united 
states regain control of its borders 
us ambassador charles pilliod jr said in midmay however 
that the law was not conceived to eliminate the movement of 
mexican workers to the united states 
the united states needs these workers not only in the farm 
area but also in the many service sectors such as food outlets 
hotels etc pilliod said in a speech to the american chamber of 
commerce in mexico city 
the law gave legal status to aliens who were able to prove they 
have lived in the united states at least since 1982 in doing so 
the alients ensured themselves of such rights as a minimum wage 
health care and education 
those who entered the united states after 1982 without legal 
documentation remain subject to deportation 
pilliod said however that predictions of mass deportations are 
unfair 
granted the border patrol will continue to apprehend and 
return undocumented aliens to their home countries as always but 
there are no plans for mass roundups he said 
bustamante and others contend that the united states cannot 
reverse a 40year trend with a law because working in the united 
states without documents if necessary has become part of the 
lifestyle of thousands of mexican families 
mexicans who go to work in the united states even those taking 
the most menial jobs can earn five to 10 times what they earn at 
home where the minimum wage is the equivalent of about 345 a day 
the northern border college estimates mexicans working in the 
united states generate about 1 billion in foreign income for 
mexico 
the simpsonrodino law gave illegal aliens who met certain 
requirements until may 4 to apply for legal status in the united 
states the majority of the more than 16 million people who 
applied are mexican 
but us immigration officials estimate that half or more of the 
6 million to 7 million illegal aliens in the united states are 
mexican 
and nobody is reporting either a mass exodus or mass 
deportations of mexicans since the may 4 deadline passed 
just as we predicted based on investigations we do at the 
northern border college nothing extraordinary has happened since 
may 5 bustamante wrote in excelsior of mexico city 
northern border college offices from tijuana to matamoros have 
been studying undocumented workers for three years 
for them the main factor that determines their willingness to 
run the risks is the labor market bustamante wrote as long as 
they keep hiring they will continue entering 
a key intent of the simpsonrodino law is to stop the hiring of 
illegal aliens by us employers 
in the toughest provision of the law employers who knowingly 
hire undocumented workers can receive stiff fines and other 
sanctions agricultural employers have until dec 1 before 
sanctioning begins 
meanwhile the crossings continue 
the majority of those who cross here are farm workers and 
theyve been given special considerations said mayor ernesto 
gomez lira of reynosa south of mcallen texas 
trejo and gomez said their city governments have programs to 
help returning undocumented migrants find work and housing but so 
far the program have not been necessary 
theres a tremendous need for workers in juarez trejo said 
referring to the booming foreignowned assembly operations that 
have created a demand for workers 
theres a real war going on one company offers a 50 percent 
discount on cafeteria food and another offers to feed them for 
free trejo said 
we want people to come so they can go to work

a classified ad in a pittsburgh newspaper 
celebese ape 14weekold baby diapertrained sucks finger 
also cougar amp bobcat babies amp other exotic animals 
the man placing the ad says he had plenty of animals to sell 
and what he didnt have at the time he could get 
theres nothing god put breath into i cant get said jim 
ledbetter who until recently ran an exotic animal business in 
uniontown pa if you want a zebra elephant or whatever no 
problem 
ledbetter went on to say he could get a black panther an 
endangered animal for 2000 but added they dont make good pets 
in florida theres a guy who sells them for 6000 a pop he 
says 
young elephants go for 20000 each old ones about 15000 he 
says white tigers are about 50000 each 90000 for a pair 
cougars are 975 bobcats 875 
everything i sell is cheap he says 
in the united states the worlds largest consumer of wildlife 
trading in exotic animals is entirely legal as is ownership in 
most places subject to some state and local restrictions that has 
spurred animal rights groups into intensifying efforts to regulate 
the industry 
david herbet captive wildlife specialist for the humane society 
of the united states in washington believes private ownership is a 
total misuse of wild animals 
about 90 percent of all wild animals die within the first two 
years of captivity regardless of whether they were captively bred 
he says 
wild animals should be left in the wild echoes doug 
inkley of the national wildlife federation in washington 
faced with increasingly vocal criticism and the hostility of 
animal rights groups dealers generally have become wary of 
publicity at a recent auction in western ohio a sign prohibited 
use of cameras and recording equipment and a nonuniformed guard 
carrying a holstered gun searched one visitors handbag people 
with cameras were escorted off the grounds 
the exotic animal business is booming according to the us 
department of agriculture 
an estimated 30000 to 50000 people in this country own breed 
exhibit or sell wild and exotic animals says pat hoctor of prairie 
creek ind publisher of the animal finders guide one of the 
largest publications in the country devoted to the trade 
the vast majority are people who have them as a hobby he 
says of that number about 300 could be considered professional 
animal dealers many of whom sell their wares through guides like 
hoctors or at several auctions held regularly throughout the 
country particularly the midwest 
among their customers 
a minnesota couple that keep a chimpanzee lion and tiger in 
their basement a boa constrictor in the bathroom and a baby skunk 
in their living room 
a private game ranch in wallisville texas where wouldbe 
biggame hunters who dont have the time or money to travel to 
africa can stalk captivebred lions for 3500 a crack a better 
trophy at half the price says owner larry wilburn 
a processing plant in warren mich and meat wholesaler in san 
bruno calif which sell biggame meat including lions 
hippopotamus reindeer and eland to restaurants eager to satisfy 
the latest national fad for lowcholesterol not to mention exotic 
meats 
a florida farm that raises ostrich emu and rhea for hides 
the latest trend in cowboyboot leather 
a roadside menagerie in pennsylvania where children can pet 
everything from mice to elephants 
a tavern in ohio where the owners pet chimpanzee smokes 
cigarettes and swigs sixpacks of beer to the delight of patrons 
in many places a private owner is free to lead a lion on a 
leash or keep a baboon in his back yard he also is free to treat 
feed and house the animal as he pleases 
certain groups feel such practices should be outlawed because 
many species pose a danger to public safety and the environment 
they also cite the case of a lioness called abby crippled at 6 
months because her ohio owners fed her improperly to make a point 
that too few people know enough to properly care for an exotic 
animal 
animals that have to be taken from an owner because of abuse or 
neglect or that grow too big or unmanageable face an uncertain 
future 
the problem with those animals is that when they do become 
mean and cant be handled the first thing people do is call the 
zoo to donate it says charles wickenhauser director of the 
pittsburgh zoo we certainly dont want an animal like that they 
have psychological problems and need special treatment to get them 
back into a particular group of animals 
hoctor gets upset on hearing about people abusing their animals 
either willfully or from ignorance but he says the follies of some 
shouldnt tarnish the entire group of owners and breeders who truly 
enjoy their animals and know more about them and care for them 
better than many zoos 
just because zoos are the commonly accepted places for animals 
doesnt mean theyre the authorities zoos are living museums 
breeders know what animals need he says 
people see us holding things in cages they misconceive that 
we are raping the wild we are actually the experts on the wild 
says hoctor who raises lions tigers waterfowl and assorted other 
animals and birds while dogooders are making a big stink about 
how they love the wild were actually saving the wild through 
breeding efforts 
animal dealer bob troumbly of grand rapids minn concedes 
there are considerable abuses and few safeguards 
a lot of people buy this stuff for macho stuff says 
troumbly 31 who operates northland wildlife this is america 
there are a lot of injustices in this world and thats just one of 
them theres always somebody out there willing to sell to somebody 
they may not feel is qualified

for dinner tonight how about gingered 
alligator ribs rattlesnake cacciatore or for the truly 
adventurous escallops of lion on a bed of fiddlehead ferns 
those are some of the dishes offered on a fairly regular basis 
at the mad batter restaurant in the seaside resort town of cape 
may nj 
the mad batter is one of dozens of gourmet restaurants 
throughout the country that have shucked chicken cordon bleu and 
filet mignon for the likes of marinated grilled camel roasted 
hippopotamus and kangaroo chili the cheapest on the menu at 1575 
the most expensive dish at the mad batter is eye of buffalo 
filet mignon with wild mushroom sauce 1950 escallops of lion 
cost 19 with rattlesnake cacciatore going for 18 
even some supermarkets are getting into the exotic act 
supplying meat to curious customers eager to test their culinary 
skills 
the trend bothers animal welfare agencies 
the desire of some people to eat exotic wild animals is a sign 
of decadence in our society these people seem to have ethical 
blinders on when it comes to their palate says craig van note 
vice president of monitor consortium which represents 35 
conservation and animal welfare groups 
it puts an increased demand upon these wild animals and 
therefore it increases the removal of them from the wild he 
says theres enough pressure on these animals as it is they 
dont need to become valuable as a human food source 
those in the exotic meat business say theres no difference 
between shooting a cow and shooting a lion particularly a lion 
thats raised in captivity on ranches and farms 
many people want meat that is leaner and lower in cholesterol 
than pork chops or steak and they say wild and exotic game often 
fits the bill nicely 
its a skyrocketing business says gerald prolman of night 
bird game and poultry in san bruno calif which wholesales 
everything from mouflon and beaver to reindeer and springbok 
this business was started in 1979 and it has grown as fast as 
people have found out the products were available 
don francis of butcher boy products in warren mich has 
processed and wholesaled conventional wild gae for 27 years now 
hes hurrying to get into the exotic business 
i saw there was a market for it and i wanted to get in while 
the gettings good says francis who sells full carcasses of 
bear and exotic deer to restaurants i just wish id been in it 
earlier 
at the mad batter chef danny mellman says many patrons often 
sample exotic meat dishes out of curiosity 
a lot of it is shock factor he says they see wildebeest 
and say ive got to eat wildebeest just to see what its like and 
to tell my friends i had it 
but he says there are plenty of customers hankering for big game 
meals on a regular basis 
there are people who call every week and say what are you 
running this week he says 
mellman has also fielded calls from people who are offended by 
his exotic fare or worry that the curried bear on their plate is 
the same bear they saw in the philadelphia zoo 
exotic meats are not zoos castoffs mellman gets much of his 
meat from abroad lion from east africa and red deer from 
scotland for instance but many of those animals also are raised 
on farms and ranches in this country 
it started about 10 years ago and its growing says george 
mazur of world safari inc of washington a wild game wholesaler 
a lot of these farms are springing up all over the place 
some people though have trouble swallowing the new fad no 
matter how tasty or healthy it is 
bob troumbly of northland wildlife in grand rapids minn sells 
animals to public zoos and similar facilities but he says he 
couldnt bring himself to sell them to someone who wants to roast 
pickle fry or boil them 
my feelings get involved he says my bleeding heart gets 
involved

as a flock of canada geese fly northward on 
their annual spring migration their honking cries arouse dozens of 
their kind held in wire cages and orange crates under a tent at a 
western ohio auction 
the tent also shelters badgers wood ducks black bears swans 
foxes prairie dogs cougars and a large female lion who growls 
when someone gets too close 
beyond in several newly built stalls and pens is a veritable 
noahs ark of animals from all parts of the globe with 
foreignsounding names such as aoudad binturong colobus emu 
ibex guanacos muntjac oryx rhea watusi and zebu 
within hours the fate of all will be set by an auctioneers 
gavel their destinations determined by the highest bidder 
woods amp waters auction held twice a year on the outskirts of 
this quiet little farm town bills itself as the largest animal 
auction east of the mississippi river 
at its threeday sale in april up to 8000 animals including 
birds and reptiles were sold to breeders animal dealers owners of 
game ranches meat dealers and hobbyists with a penchant for a 
particular species says woods amp waters owner dick osting 
for the most part the customers were a reticent lot who shunned 
publicity and people trying to photograph animals were escorted off 
the premises by a security guard 
osting complains that the media have distorted their 
business by only photographing animals that are injured kept in 
undersized cages or left in pens without food and water 
the media want to stir up a storyto shock readers says 
osting 37 whos operated the familyrun auction for five years 
the only thing the media do when they print this gory stuff is to 
upset the humane society and the government which is two people we 
dont want upset at us 
osting says auctions help the wild and exotic animal industry 
because they bring the business of buying and selling animals out 
into public view 
the intention of the auction is to clean up the business he 
says were stepping out into the open inviting regulation 
were saying as long as you dont regulate us out of the 
business regulate us 
animal welfare people contend there are abuses anne maroukis 
cofounder of guardians of the earth an ohiobased animal welfare 
rights group says some cages were inadequate as in the case of 
three bear cubs brought to the auction in a cardboard box or too 
small an adult black bear she says had cuts above his eyes from 
hitting his head against exposed metal edges when hed try to 
stand and some cages lacked food and water 
osting says some injuries do occur in the transport of animals 
to the auction he adds ive heard about foxes in too small a 
cage hes at a threeday auction he probably just came from real 
nice facilities and hell probably go back to real nice facilities 
after all the animal is here for just three days i think they 
make way too big an issue of it 
maroukis says weve tried to work with the department of 
agriculture they keep saying they have no jurisdiction but if 
they dont who does 
don castner an inspector with the us department of 
agriculture says he saw some injuries but none appeared 
lifethreatening 
auctions are not regulated by the federal government so 
inspectors for the usda which oversees the transportation of 
animals can only cite dealers or breeders whose animals appear to 
have been injured in transit he says the usda has no control over 
privately owned animals 
when asked about a flock of ostrichlike birds called rheas with 
bloodied legs which osting said probably were injured during 
transport castner replied that the usda also doesnt regulate 
birds or reptiles 
we cant do what we cant do we only regulate the 
transportation of animals owned by dealers thats it

editors note hes a seasoned practitioner of a relatively 
new steadily booming and widely mistrusted profession in america 
david sawyer political consultant didnt have an entry in the 
recent presidential primaries but he has some definite views on 
why the winners won and the losers lost 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
david sawyer sat on the sidelines during the 
presidential primaries just ended an unusual place for him in a 
hot election campaign but there he sat like a maestro in the 
audience enjoying it making notes 
dole he says reflecting on the campaign that one writer 
likened to a demolition derby made some errors that hurt him 
ruined him so he lost bush won bush made few errors dukakis on 
the other side made few errors and dukakis won 
david sawyer is a political consultant 
he is a democrat and works only for democrats he also is a 
seasoned practitioner of a relatively new steadily booming and 
widely mistrusted profession in america 
one popular perception of a political consultant is that of a 
modernday machiavelli who knows how to use electronic guile to 
manipulate a benighted electorate into mistaking form for substance 
nonsense says sawyer but it is obvious that he feels some 
of the skills that good political consultants do bring to a 
campaign were lacking in some of the races this spring 
robert doles for instance the republican senator in sawyers 
view failed badly in organizing his campaign and developing his 
strategy he didnt appoint a strong team he tried to run it all 
himself and you cant do that dole he feels would have made a 
more formidable opponent for dukakis 
george bush on the other hand put together a superb 
organization the campaign carried the candidate people who run a 
good campaign have the edge 
michael dukakis dukakis enters the fall campaign much less 
damaged than walter mondale was when he entered the 84 campaign 
dukakis is beholden to none of the special interest groups that 
mondale was identified with dukakis ran a simply fine campaign and 
it paid off 
that in short sawyer explains is the job of the consultant 
to give his candidate the edge 
david sawyer is 52 trim with thinning gray hair and gray eyes 
whatever it is that he and his partner scott miller do to gain 
that edge they are apparently financially successful at it their 
wellappointed suite of offices overlook central park in one of 
manhattans classiest midtown neighborhoods 
in the past five years the sawyermiller group has doubled in 
size from 20 to 40 reflecting the meteoric rise in america of the 
political consulting trade 
they even have a trade association and it has grown from 75 
members 10 years ago to 650 today its president brad oleary 
estimates that as many as 3000 professionals in america may be 
considered political consultants 
sawyer also represents a certain coming of age in the state of 
the art 
the consulting fraternity had its origins in the advertising 
agencies summoned off madison avenue by politicians a practice 
roundly criticized in the 1968 book the selling of the 
president 
in an ironic turnaround sawyer has expanded into the commercial 
field using techniques learned in political campaigns he 
represents political candidates but also cocacola apple computer 
and a dozen or so others mainly those dealing with unexpected 
market changes and stiff competition 
political campaigns require his companys complete attention 
sawyer says and mainly for that reason he sat out the primaries 
we felt we wouldnt be able to give our commercial work all it 
deserves if we do any political work this year it will be in the 
general election campaign 
this election year an estimated 18 billion will be spent on 
politics with 500 million going for tv ads and 100 million for 
political consultants for that kind of money politicians must 
consider a consultants service as something more than that of a 
debating coach 
true says sawyer but hardly more sinister 
a political campaign is like a war says sawyer in a 
limited period of time you have to seize certain territory and hold 
it it involves strategy and tactics i work on both levels 
the strategic team about 10 people are experts in various 
categories who determine how the candidate positions himself how 
he contrasts himself with his opponents which issues in the array 
of issues he believes in should be the key issues of the campaign 
it was on the strategic level that albert gore stumbled 
according to sawyer

although he was very attractive he began to be seen as 
opportunistic changing his strategy he ran as a defense 
candidate then as a southern candidate then as a jewish 
candidate then as an economic populist candidate 
it is very important to develop a singleminded clear 
strategy gore ended up with four or five different strategies 
which made it difficult for any one of them to be heard 
dukakis for his part sawyer says had such great strength in 
terms of money credibility as a sitting governor and such a 
firstrate campaign organization it was tough to compete against 
him of all the contending democrats dukakis emerged in sawyers 
view as the most electable in november 
the tactical teams job says sawyer is to figure out how to 
communicate a candidates complex agenda often in 30second bites 
not just for tv spots the nightly news is done in 30second 
bites as well or less its the nature of the business nowadays 
and it isnt all bad you can express your position on some pretty 
complex issues in 30 seconds 
for example i oppose any further aid to the contras three 
seconds if elected i would ask congress to raise taxes 10 
percent across the board to pay off our deficit five seconds 
the reasoning the subtleties come out in the formal debates 
and the print media the electorate in my opinion has never been 
better informed about the position of the candidates on any issue 
and on his or her character 
the tacticians techniques helped along by advanced technology 
including instant polling videotape and federal express are where 
consultants show their battlefield savvy 
you have to be able to take advantage of every opportunity 
change your strategy on a moments notice often its a matter of 
timing 
sawyer demonstrated this last year in the kentucky democratic 
primary sawyers firm like nearly all consultant firms 
represents candidates of only one party that race put him up 
against two others with similar reputations as heavy hitters among 
democrats bob squier representing former gov john y brown the 
early favorite and david doak and robert shrum representing 
thenlt gov steve beshear the leading challenger 
sawyers candidate was wallace wilkinson a political unknown 
who registered only about 5 percent in the polls and was given 
little chance to improve 
little chance that is until the last two weeks of the campaign 
our two opponents began attacking each other with spots 
accusing each other of all sorts of things and both advocated a 
tax increase 
we discovered through polls that the voters disapproved of 
the negative campaigns they were waging against each other so we 
moved in quickly we said in effect that they were both right in 
their accusations and we pushed for a lottery that we had 
advocated all along instead of new taxes 
we had the overall strategy but we needed an opening to 
execute it and that gave us the opening we exploited it call it 
guerrilla tactics 
whatever you call it wallace wilkinson is now governor of 
kentucky 
could any campaign consultants tactics have saved gary hart 
absolutely not hart was doomed as soon as the donna rice 
episode came out the most important thing people need to have is 
trust in their leader trust in his judgement and his character 
hart sacrificed any trust the people could have had in him 
sawyer was lured into politics from a career as a producer of 
documentary films in 1970 when he was asked to do some film work 
for a candidate for governor of illinois by 1974 he was into 
political consulting with both feet 
his batting average has stayed at about 750 good enough for 
the big leagues clients include four sitting senators and six 
governors and for an expanding foreign trade as well his clients 
also include corazon aquino president of the philippines and 
israels foreign minister shimon peres 
he has taken advantage of every technological advance as have 
his colleagues but in his view the most important electioneering 
change in the past decade has been not in sophisticated technology 
but the evergrowing sophistication of voters 
americans are exposed to commercial advertising more 
aggressive than ever before to expanded news coverage because of 
satellite transmissions and you just dont manipulate them you 
cant 
tv is like an xray machine voters can see through false 
statements or sloganeering instead of substantive debate

against a backdrop of jagged mountains 
a columbineblue sky and summer meadows bursting with wild 
flowers a flash of blinding light 
myrna rubelmans diamonds had trapped the sun 
dressed in a casual tshirt baseball cap flyfishing vest and 
slacks mrs rubelman wore her jewels as she cast an artificial fly 
into a classic colorado trout stream 
along with her husband pete a periodontist and two other 
couples from islamorada fla mrs rubelman was on her first 
flyfishing expedition 
i love it she said as a professional guide coached her 
about the proper grip on her fly rod and cautioned her not to flick 
her wrist 
mrs rubelman like the other financially welloff physically 
active middleaged vacationers scattered along the crystalclear 
stream had no intention of roughing it in the wilderness 
attentive staff members at elktrout lodge hovered nearby to make 
sure she didnt have to 
the rubelmans and their friends julian and polly unger and 
hank and joy brown are among a growing number of affluent 
americans on the lookout for superb fly fishing 
it doesnt matter whether they are beginners or experts they 
want to catch plenty of fish in a beautiful setting trout 
salmon and steelhead dont live in ugly places they want to eat 
well and sleep well while theyre doing it their hosts must 
provide all perhaps more than the comforts of home 
that was the idea behind elktrout when andy shepard a santa 
rosa calif banking executive and some of his friends pooled 
resources and built an elegant lodge on the banks of the colorado 
river in 1982 
at first the dozen investors intended elktrout to be a private 
haven just for them their families and their friends they 
started buying river frontage along the colorado and several 
smaller streams near the farming town of kremmling located two 
hours northwest of denver on the western slope of the continental 
divide 
today elktrout is a luxurious log compound which accommodates up

river water three miles of gold medal water on the blue river 
nine lakes and numerous creeks with names like cataract and 
troublesome 
trout that lunge at the guests artificial flies are commonly 16 
to 24 inches long weigh up to 5 pounds and fight like the wild 
creatures they are nearly all the fish caught by elktrout anglers 
except trout kept in special dinner ponds are released 
exceptions are trophy fish 
a days fishing is pleasantly interrupted by a gourmet picnic 
lunch at tables set beside the stream an evening gathering around 
the huge rock fireplace and afterward a candlelight dinner

technical about fly fishing says steve herter elktrouts 
resident manager we provide instruction and let them discover

bounds were getting a very good cross section of clientele in the 
40to60year range some are older wealthy couples a lot are 
upandcoming professionals who are intrigued by the sport and a 
lot more women are interested in learning about fly fishing we 
even have one lady from texas who comes here to fish while her 
husband sits on the bank and reads books 
another devoted fly fisherwoman is susie fitzgerald coowner 
with her husband mike of a specialty travel company in wexford 
pa

mrs fitzgerald says frontiers guide chris child is 
investigating fishing opportunities in a remote chinese province 
where recently she caught a fish the scientists havent even 
identified yet it looks like brown trout but isnt she says 
frontiers also has teamed with trout unlimited to open up soviet 
fishing to western anglers under a new agreement signed by american 
and soviet sportsmen 
we are committed to making this happen and were looking at 
inaugurating it in the 89 season mrs fitzgerald says we are 
focusing on rivers in the soviet union which come into the white 
sea there are fantastic atlantic salmon in them and we have about 
500 people just waiting to sign up for the first trips 
mrs fitzgerald has fished on four continents and a multitude of 
islands after a recent trip to christmas island in the pacific 
where she relentlessly hauled in 8pound bonefish for a week she 
wrote in the orvis news 
that silver shadow swimming nose down and tail visible in 
10 to 20 inches of sparkling water makes your heart stand 
stillwhen i connect its dynamite you cant imagine a more 
thrilling five to 15 minutes 
if merely visiting some of the worlds best fishing holes isnt 
enough there are investment opportunities available in all the 
hot spots for fanatics who can afford them 
in montana a buyer can get nearly two miles of ruby river 
frontage a 3000squarefoot log home and a guest house for 
550000 
in alaska a luxurious flyin fishing lodge which can 
accommodate 20 guests in the king salmon area is listed for about 
2 million 
mike george of polar realty in anchorage after joking that 
anythings for sale in alaska in these hard economic times 
adds that there are many smaller lodges for sale starting at 
150000 
weve had substantial inquiries and even some purchases from 
foreign investors who want to get into the alaska recreation 
market george says 
a recent ad in fly fisherman magazine spotlighted a property in 
quebec which boasted a sixbedroom furnished estate caretakers 
house 330 acres atlantic salmon and trout river duck marsh and 
game hunting mere dreamers need not apply the ad warns 
serious inquiries only 
in the british isles there is almost no public sportsfishing 
water left the resale value of fishing rights is based on the 
number of fish expected to be caught in a year along that 
particular stretch of river a 10year average catch is used as a 
benchmark 
thirty years ago the average sale price was 100 to 300 per 
atlantic salmon per year today the rate can top 7000 per salmon 
on such famous scottish rivers as the tweed or the spey and the dee 
each section of private ownership is called a beat 
individual beats average 200 to 300 yards in recent years the 
popularity of fly fishing has prompted beat owners to divide them 
up into time shares just like condominiums on the costa del sol 
and the french riviera 
if a fisherman expects to catch 20 fish during his annual week 
on a popular river he may pay as much as 150000 for his time 
share that adds up to 6500 per fish 
renting the same rights for a onetime oneweek fling can cost 
as much as 50 for every fish the angler expects to catch based on 
the rivers past performance 
that doesnt match the value the us fish and wildlife service 
placed on one of its trout this year goldie a prized 4yearold 
albino that vanished last christmas from the ennis mont national 
fish hatchery 
in a wanted bulletin federal biologists said that when goldie 
disappeared from their visitor display pond she weighed more than 
20 pounds and was distinguished by her golden yellow color 
the feds put up a 2500 reward for information leading to her 
recovery dead or alive her frozen body was found in february in a 
snowbank near steamboat springs colo 
federal wildlife agents say two men stole goldie and two other 
fish from the governments pond first took her to a bar in 
bozeman mont then weighed her in a milner colo grocery store 
23 pounds they finally got rid of the victim when they heard 
authorities were searching for her 
a tip from montana and from someone who saw the fish in the 
grocery store helped agents track down the suspects the government 
is now seeking to determine who earned the reward and may 
prosecute depending on the outcome of the fws investigation 
goldies remains today are on ice in the denver fws office 
once shes no longer needed for evidence we plan to preserve 
goldie then display her at the ennis hatchery with a sign telling 
about the great fish saga says jack hallowell fws assistant 
regional director for public affairs 
now thats a fish story as hallowell put it goldie became 
the most soughtafter fish since moby dick

four worldclass trout rivers flow 
almost by the door of tiny rl winston rod co whose fly rods are 
recognized as among the best by hardcore equipment zealots 
money is no object for fly fishermen who seek out the winston 
factory in this western montana ranching town to test cast and 
maybe buy a 305 gossamertipped graphite wand or a 900 objet 
dart in bamboo 
its a fact that fishermen sometimes get starry looks when 
they first touch one of our rods its affection says tom 
morgan who bought the established san francisco rod maker in 1973 
and moved it to montana 
a rod communicates with you morgan says when you wiggle 
a winston rod it talks back to you with a good message 
he implied theres little back talk from a massproduced rod 
retailing for 1999 in a discount store 
our goal isnt to provide everyone with a winston rod and 
everyone cant afford them morgan says so the factory makes fly 
rods at an artistic snails pace of about 2000 a year 
morgan doubts his 59yearold company will ever produce more 
than 3000 rods a year 
morgan and the other winston employees dont blink an eye if an 
angler wants to cast half a dozen fly rods on the lawn across the 
street or buy one and substitute zebra wood for the standard 
walnut reel seat 
morgan who guided for 14 years and fishes all over the world 
might even accompany an eager angler to one of the nearby 
blueribbon trout rivers the big hole beaverhead ruby or 
jefferson 
he might even rig his favorite winston an 8foot 4weight 
graphite i like to fish small dry flies its just perfect for 
that morgan said 
winston has no fixed working days or hours for its five regular 
and seven parttime employees 
if one of the trout streams beckons they are free to go 
morgan says this provides them with the artistic freedom and 
inspiration they need to accomplish outstanding work 
winstons graphite rods are considered among the worlds best 
they are coated with a translucent kellygreen finish and guides 
are wrapped with matching green thread 
winston wont wind a rod with different color thread for a 
customer or do anything else that makes no aesthetic sense or 
technical sense morgan says 
there are 89 models of winston fly rods in 11 line sizes three 
actions three materials from 5 feet to 10 feet long 
once an angler buys a basic winston theres an enticing array 
of accouterments maybe a scrimshaw reel seat lovingly carved with 
a kingfisher german silver reel banks your name engraved on the 
rod 
our average customer has three to five of our rods and ive 
talked to people with a dozen morgan says 
almost all of winstons rods are graphite the bamboo operation 
supervised by partner glenn brackett may turn out only 75 rods 
this year 
tonkin cane for the beautifully finished classic rods comes 
from mainland china anglers may have to wait four to eight months 
for each custombuilt rod whose blemishfree bamboo strips are cut 
within a tolerance of onethousandth of an inch 
only 5 percent of the bamboo we get goes into our rods 
brackett says we reject the rest 
there are a lot of other good expensive fly rods on the market 
from companies like sage powell scott teton thomas amp thomas g 
loomis and orvis in fact winstons graphite rod blanks are made 
on its own tapers by g loomis a larger rod maker 
some fly rod companies offer futuristic materials 
superior tapers parabolic action the latest 
breakthrough materials morgan says a rods design is more 
important than the material it has to work for the type of 
fishing you do at winston we dont jump on every new material 
that comes along 
morgan says that a lot of the people who build fly rods dont 
fish enough you cant make great fly rods if you dont use them a 
lot 
he himself fishes a great deal in part because you almost 
always fish in a place where you can rebuild your spirit when im 
steelheading at times i almost wish a fish wouldnt come to my 
hook 
when it comes to hooking trout he believes in catching and 
releasing them for the marvelous sport they give us he says 
they deserve our best treatment you can turn the fish loose not 
like hunting when you kill the animal

a fly fisherman doesnt have to wear 
designer labels or own expensive gear to land the big ones a trout 
with a brain the size of a pea doesnt discriminate between l l 
bean and levis 
but serious anglers nearly all agree that collecting gadgets 
perusing catalogs and spending a snowy winters day inside a 
fishing equipment store is part of the ritual 
like one great beauty surreptitiously ogling anothers jewels 
fly fishermen check out each others tackle with discriminating 
eyes 
theres a genteel snobbery in showing up on opening day along 
the beaver kill river in new york sporting an antique hiram leonard 
split tonkin bamboo rod a wheatley fly box a few irresistibles 
tied by harry or elsie darbee and a faded but muchbeloved red 
shirt thats survived being stuffed into duffles from ireland to 
new zealand and back again by way of patagonia and venezuela 
in spite of sneaking suspicions that fish get spooked by red 
fly fishermen love the color big boy tomato red american beauty 
red fourth of july firecracker red they wear it in crimson felt 
hats crimped at the brim in scarlet shirts with elaborate flies 
embroidered on the pocket in cherry bandanas tied around sunburned 
necks on hot days 
to many a splash of red is a talisman 
choose me it says to the submerged fish with poor eyesight 
see my bright hat my bright suspenders of all the men mucking 
about in your watery world im the one who will honor you the most 
you the big one there if you pick me i will hang you over my 
fireplace display you next to my office bar maybe just let you go 
after i take your picture 
amid the brown beige and khaki in a fly fishermans kit bag 
there is usually a treasured piece of red 
but an angler who wants the works will need a lot of green 
if an emperor with no clothes walked into jack dennis outdoor 
shop in jackson wyo and got outfitted in time to be on the snake 
river for lunch this is what it could cost him 
insulated waders 100 
leather boots 85 
boot liner 30 
fancy shirt 4495 
hat preferably red 17 
fly fishermans vest 60 
graphite fly rod and reel 80 to 200 and up 
aluminum fly rod case 40 
leader material 18 to 32

clippers 4 
flies 135 to 250 need at least a dozen 
fly box 14 
net for optimists 14 to 30 
bamboo creel 40 
then there are lessons jack dennis instructors charge 40 to 
teach two people for two hours while an allday guided session on 
the snake runs 200 for two lunch included 
if the novice fisherman is really hooked dreams of bonefishing 
at christmas island begin to dance in his head that adventure 
costs 1700 not counting air fare to honolulu 
meanwhile fish are waiting in the laxa i laxadalur river in 
iceland the king salmon river in alaska the spey the dee and 
the tweed rivers in scotland the bow river of canada

editors note for moviegoers and readers around the world 
marcel pagnol sketched a peasants france an unchanging world 
where the past shaped the future the present however has muscled 
in the peasant is vanishing from the french scene with small farms 
disappearing at a dramatic rate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
cugeslespins france ap in the hills where jean de 
florette struggled to raise rabbit food farming is now small 
potatoes the major local asset is a theme park called ok 
corral 
this cobblestoned town in provence where people still remember 
what victor hugo had for lunch on a stagecoach stop is where 
claude berry made two films about peasants from the pages of marcel 
pagnol 
but the sort of taciturn hardscrabble peasants portrayed in 
jean de florette and manon des sources are already history 
of the thousand or so residents in cuges two maybe three 
peasants remain says vice mayor giles aicardi who defines a 
peasant as one who survives only by what he grows and sells 
cuges reflects a crisis in western europe and especially 
france there is too much food and big producers who track their 
subsidies on computers are pushing small farms out of existence 
seven percent of french workers are farmers three times the 
level of west germany or britain but more than half are over 50 
and 50 percent of that group has no heirs expected to stay on the 
land 
the problem is partly social spurred by television with good 
roads into town many young frenchmen reject country life it is a 
matter of keeping them down on the farm after theyve seen paris 
but few of those who want to stay have the choice 
my kids are not in this business says yves cornille 50 
one of cuges last peasants that was my decision it is a 
wonderful life independent not too hard you just cant survive 
cornille with pressed slacks and a new renault is no pagnol 
peasant oh life has changed since then he laughs 
once you could make it with 250 acres he says now you 
need 2500 if i were 25 or 30 id quit tomorrow 
many like cornille fault the european economic community for 
opening borders among its 12 members and applying complex subsidies 
and quotas in 1992 borders are to open yet wider 
the common market set up first for iron and steel threatens to 
collapse over beef and butter twothirds of its budget goes to 
subsidize or store food and wine much of which goes to waste 
european governments reject american urgings to end farm 
subsidies citing a duty to preserve ways of life dating back 2000 
years but they also discourage production they cannot sell 
cornille grows wine grapes more lucrative than food crops 
modern farmers stick with a single crop or just a few their 
wives instead of churning butter or putting up jam look for jobs 
at the ok corral a version of le far west done with ample 
poetic license a son of peasants swaggered down a dusty street 
asked his name he replied in mauricechevalier english bronco 
far to the west the town of ampus plans to use 500 acres of 
farmland for a space research center and country club with 
laboratories and an oldstyle bistro set inside giant golf balls 
like so many places we can no longer live by agriculture 
says mayor roger casanova a geology professor in nice an hour 
away we must find other ways to make our community viable 
casanova has found norwegianlebanese interests to invest part 
of the 40 million needed for a 27hole golf course around a 
futuristic campus designed to attract a range of thinkers 
young people will learn the techniques of space research 
aeronautics advanced computer sciences and environmental science 
he says half the town thinks im loony he says 
rene aicard 32 is sticking to farming he squeaks by on his 
150 acres raising strawberries potatoes lettuce and rapeseed for 
oil his wife denise hauls it to market in a battered little van 
its so sad says denise shaking her head farming is the 
most beautiful profession in the world and you work the hardest 
but it just doesnt pay anymore 
in paris yves van haecke chief adviser to the ministry of 
agriculture acknowledged that the government had an uphill fight 
to encourage young people to hold onto family farms 
the drop has become dramatic in the last 10 years he says 
farms disappear now at a rate of 3 percent a year and the rate 
is increasing no question theyre on their way out 
as small farms go hundreds of rural communities alter their 
centuriesold character 
ampus is not changing fast the cubbyhole newspaperdry goods 
store displays a tattered advertising poster on the door 
canadian rat poison their last supper 
a clutch of old men in cloth caps by the fountain seem not to 
have moved since the last king clattered by in a carriage 
in cuges on a wide road to marseille stylish hairdressers and 
shops full of electronic gadgets have replaced blacksmiths and 
crackerbarrel grocers 
there is plenty of the closed peasant mentality left says 
andree chikitou who decided against putting up a sign in her 
restaurant saying the jean de florette cast ate here 
with only three years in residence she found parking tickets on 
her car if she left it on the little plaza outside hometown people 
parked with impunity 
still she says it was better than the last small french town 
she lived in she recalls 
one day the butcher woman said well youve been here 10 
years you sort of belong ill tell you what happened this 
morning 
but martin santoro the aging town priest who played the priest 
in the films sees pagnols france as having evaporated theyre 
not interested in that way any more he says kids are 
leaving 
berry wanted to film around pagnols hometown of aubagne but he 
found that to be a semiurban sprawl 
outdoor scenes were no problem he located an old farm in the 
hilltop municipality and commune of riboud which has a restaurant 
a post office a town hall and a total population of five 
the village scenes for manon des sources were not so easy 
finally berry settled on mirabeau farther north in the 
vaucluse but he had to pay the town to put off installing parking 
meters and painting white lines around the fountain that gave no 
water

editors note in an affluent town on the connecticut river a 
new subdivision features antique homes that have been dismantled 
rebuilt and equipped with todays conveniences such as burglar 
alarms and air conditioning the price tag 800000 to 12 
million 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an 18th century tavern with trees sprouting 
through the floorboards seemed destined to be razed in a 
firefighting drill until it was rescued by a couple of connecticut 
developers who look to the past to find fancy homes for the future 
now it will be restored with modern conveniences added and 
become one of the dozen or so antique homes in an unusual 33acre 
subdivision in this affluent town on the connecticut river 
developers harry p broom jr and william oberg are scouring the 
countryside for other vintage homes for the subdivision they call 
sterling meadows the homes when finished will carry a modern 
price tag of 800000 to 12 million broom and oberg say they 
havent tried to sell any yet 
the former owner of the old tavern they said sold it to them 
rather than to the salem fire department which was going to burn 
it down for a firefighting drill 
the problem is most old houses are accidents of geography 
says oberg 32 of essex who left a career in finance more than 
two years ago to become a developer 
what used to be a convenient location on the main road is now 
a busy commercial district with a lot of traffic going by and they 
end up being torn down for a new office building a new apartment 
building or one thing or another 
oberg says the partnership has purchased five buildings for its 
subdivision and is still looking for others to fill the seven other 
lots four buildings are now being reconstructed at the site a 
concrete foundation is ready for a federalstyle home from 
massachusetts that dates to around 1800 
they expect to complete the development in about three years 
the first step is saving the buildings a painstaking task the 
partnership has paid 5000 to 20000 for the relics and spends 
five to six weeks dismantling them 
with a crew of carpenters supplied by brooms other business 
hb broom housewright inc a restoration company nearly 
everything is saved from frame and windows to mantels and 
floorboards 
broom and oberg remain true to each buildings original design 
which means for example rebuilding six fireplaces in the former 
salem tavern but the structures are outfitted with modern 
conveniences such as burglar alarm systems and central air 
conditioning 
when we rebuild these houses were using all the original 
features and restoring the house as best we can but were not 
building museums says broom 44 of lyme whose office is in a 
building built in 1770 to serve as a general store for steamships 
on the connecticut river and the ferry that to this day shuttles 
between chester and hadlyme 
were building houses that are practical to live in 
the interiors are slightly modified with ells to accommodate the 
modern trappings of kitchens and bathrooms otherwise the homes are 
original right down to the slightly offcenter front doors on some 
they plan to pave the winding road leading to the development 
and line it with sugar maples stone walls and picket fences 
antique lampposts will be recreated based on a design borrowed 
from deerfield mass 
were trying to create the perfect new england environment 
oberg says we try not to change the details at all and take 
small liberties with the ells 
oberg is quick to dispel notions that the developers are trying 
to imitate sturbridge village in massachusetts or williamsburg in 
connecticut he says they confine their efforts to homes built 
between 1700 and 1815 and lean toward those in formal styles such 
as federal or georgian 
similar but smaller subdivisions of five relocated historic 
homes each are located in rural killingworth conn and in 
waitsfield vt 
oberg criticizes the socalled purist approach to 
restoration which is light on modern conveniences and heavy on 
dark interior colors 
the result when a socalled purist restores a house is that 
the houses tend to be dark and use dark colors and that is not 
quite what everybody would like he says 
the sterling meadows development has met the approval of town 
officials who are committed to 2 and 3acre zoning in order to 
preserve the towns atmosphere 
about 1910 people live in lymes 33 square miles homeowners 
include former new york city mayor john lindsay and brooklyn ny 
district attorney elizabeth holtzman 
if youre gonna have development of that nature you could do 
no better than skip broom says lyme first selectman john f 
yeomans referring to broom by his nickname theyre as good as 
any and better than most 
oberg and broom formed their partnership 2 years ago after 
oberg bought a tract of land alongside a 12acre parcel broom 
already owned oberg says he has had a lifelong interest in antique 
homes while broom quit a job as an analyst with shell oil co about 
15 years ago to start his restoration business 
i had a piece of land i bought as a investment and i always 
wanted to put antique houses on it says broom whose company has 
restored about 80 homes oddly enough he wanted to do the same 
thing

british classical actor patrick stewart 
credits shakespeare with putting him on the bridge of the starship 
enterprise 
a year ago stewart who stars as capt jeanluc picard on 
star trek the next generation was more familiar with richard 
iii and paduans than mr spock and klingons beam me up 
scotty was virtually a mystery 
the role has made me part of the star trek legend and its 
because of the actors adage that you never know whos out there 
he says 
a friend asked stewart to read some dramatic extracts at a 
literary lecture at ucla and in the audience was robert justman 
who had been a producer of the original star trek television 
series and was casting paramount televisions new syndicated series 
allegedly he turned to his wife and said we have just found 
our captain stewart says well it took six months before i 
got the role i went back to london and was hoping to take a 
revival of whos afraid of virginia woolf into the west end if i 
had i wouldnt be here today i returned to los angeles to read 
and got an offer 
it surprised me more than any other offer ive had i thought 
it unusual for an english actor to be involved in an american tv 
series certainly one with a large cultlike following like star 
trek 
stewart was vaguely familiar with star trek he sometimes 
watched it with his children between matinee and evening 
performances at the royal shakespeare theater 
the new star trek series launched last september blasted 
into orbit in the ratings its the thirdhighest rated syndicated 
show behind wheel of fortune and jeopardy the original 
series which ran three years on nbc in the 1960s is frequently 
the highestrated offnetwork syndicated show the four star 
trek movies have taken in nearly 350 million nearly four 
million videocassettes of the series episodes and the movies have 
been sold 
stewart says it took some time for him to realize that by being 
cast in the show he had become an american icon 
i was unaware of the huge huge audience waiting for this 
show he says so i didnt share the apprehension some had 
on a recent visit to a television festival in cannes france he 
learned the shows power i was entirely unknown in the city 
he says but one night i went with many others to visit the 
american aircraft carrier eisenhower i was immediately recognized 
by a young officer i was soon surrounded by crewmen they had all 
seen the show in virginia and their families sent them tapes it 
was an overwhelming experience 
prior to star trek stewart was relatively unknown in this 
country he was in the movies excalibur and dune and the tv 
miniseries i claudius he played karla the head of the kgb in 
the miniseries based on two john lecarre novels smileys 
people and tinker tailor spy most of his acting 
experience however has been on the stage he is particularly 
associated with the royal shakespeare co 
he also teaches at the university of california at santa barbara 
i was worried about this role because of the number of years 
involved he says ive always moved around from role to role 
and area to area the fear was i wouldnt be able to do that im 
not sure i can focus my career on one thing for such a long time 
stewarts wife sheila falconer is a choreographer who staged 
the wizard of oz in london a son is a student at the 
california institute for the arts a daughter is in school in 
england 
he grew up in yorkshire in a town called mirfield which 
supports 12 drama clubs with a population of 11000 
it was a typical mill town with weaving sheds in the bottom 
and sheep on the hills he says when i was 12 i started 
spending my evenings rehearsing and performing nobody thought it 
unusual it didnt become unusual until i turned professional 
after he was cast as the captain of the new enterprise a lot of 
discussion went into how he should sound he experimented with 
various accents finally settling on a standard english accent 
we continue to have disagreements about how certain words are 
pronounced he says 
im the director of a teaching group at santa barbara and i 
frequently hear student actors say they should use a british accent 
for shakespeare i point out that in shakespeares time the accent 
was close to todays american accent

tale of innocence lost the plays which also star jason robards 
are running in repertory at the neil simon theater as part of the 
first new york international festival of the arts 
i always say that i am not an oneill expert the actress 
explained recently before a performance here where the two yale 
repertory theater productions were polished before moving to new 
york i feel all i really know are his women 
and dewhurst gets to play one of oneills greatest in long 
days journey into night the playwrights exorcism of his own 
devastating family life it is directed by another oneill master 
jose quintero she stars as mary tyrone a tragic drugaddled 
woman who was modeled after oneills own mother 
oneills women have great passion a passion for life she 
says nothing is done halfway its not little tiny things that 
happen to them these plays are not about the day you cracked up 
the car and didnt know how to explain it 
literally what these women do affects everything around them 
what they do cannot be taken back it cant be erased or not 
remembered in each one of his plays it changes lifes course 
for dewhurst what changed her career and forever stamped her as 
an oneill actress was the 1973 revival of a moon for the 
misbegotten which also starred robards and also was directed by 
quintero it was a production that almost didnt happen 
we were all busted she recalls jason had just come out 
of an auto accident i had no money and jose had just risen up 
sober someone said put something together and go out and do 
summer stock thinking we would do a comedy 
quintero suggested a moon for the misbegotten a play he and 
dewhurst first did 15 years earlier at the spoleto festival in 
italy 
the only producer who would take them was marshall migatz who 
ran a small summer theater at a catholic girls college in lake 
forest ill just before the contracts were signed migatz was 
struck by a car and killed 
it was on the point of being canceled but his board came 
forward and said they would pay us if we would go into rehearsal 
dewhurst said 
the result was the most memorable oneill production of the 
decade 
when the play came to broadway the following december it was 
cheered by critics and audiences and dewhurst won a bestactress 
tony for her portrait of josie hogan 
i said at the time that i wasnt going to do any more 
oneill she says dewhurst didnt want to be labeled as an 
actress who only did oneill plays 
compounding it was my doing my gene she says referring 
to her onewoman show written by barbara gelb about the life of 
carlotta monterey oneills exotic wife i thought well that 
covers them all what more can i do 
the idea for these latest productions was born 10 years ago 
when a group of actors writers and producers got together at monte 
cristo cottage oneills boyhood home in new london conn the 
actors including dewhurst robards and geraldine fitzgerald read 
excerpts from oneill plays it was agreed to mount a production of 
long days journey into night in 1988 the 100th anniversary of 
oneills birth 
my mentality is that im lucky if i know what im doing 
tomorrow dewhurst laughs so forget 10 years from now but it 
came 
it was quintero again who had the idea of alternating 
performances of long days journey and ah wilderness 
we were going to show the two sides of oneill the dream 
family and the real family dewhurst says the way to view the 
plays is to see long days journey first and ah wilderness 
second then you understand the second play although its a comedy 
and sweet and beautifully written it is given an added depth and 
becomes very touching 
for dewhurst the two oneill plays are only part of her 
professional life she also is president of actors equity the 
actors union its a job she has held since 1985 and now is running 
unopposed for reelection 
ellen burstyn a former president had talked her into running 
for the actors equity council when burstyn left the presidency 
she persuaded dewhurst to run for the top office 
i really have a great affection for actors as a group 
dewhurst says i find them very courageous its a profession of 
rejection 
dewhurst embraced the union job like she did acting on stage 
wholeheartedly 
im not an office person and yet i didnt want to be a 
figurehead says the woman who also serves on countless other 
boards and committees including the actors fund of america and save 
the theaters which works for the preservation of broadway 
playhouses 
dewhurst has been able to separate her numerous jobs even when 
she is doing a play as difficult dark and demanding as long 
days journey into night 
i have no feeling about dragging shows behind me like 
chains dewhurst says if a heavy show goes well you come off 
stage feeling terrific i do ive gotten rid of all the horrors 
that are around for the day the week the year the life they 
have just been dropped out there theyre now the audiences

joe piscopos beginnings on the comedy trail 
may well have started when his father took him to see jerry lewis 
in the nutty professor at a new jersey movie house 
i remember the theater the seat everything he says 
boy i just thought that it was the greatest movie ever made it 
may very well have been i still feel that way when i watch it on 
videotape 
i remember me and my dad and my brother watching the movie and 
seeing jerry go into his character which im sure influenced me in 
later comedy years said piscopo as he did a lewis imitation 
brilliant brilliant brilliant jerry directed that too 
twentyfive years later piscopo is riding high television 
specials concerts the momentary madness tour a book the 
piscopo tapes constant exposure on commercials miller lite 
and movies 
the latest is dead heat in which he and treat williams do 
battle with a gang of thugs who wont die you might think that the 
intense williams and the loose piscopo would make an incongruous 
couple both on and off the screen 
treat was great the comedian said treats got as sick a 
sense of humor as i do and it was wild between takes and 
everything we had a great time treat worked very hard on this 
film he had a lot of makeup he had to get in eight hours of 
makeup for certain scenes 
for some reason we both did silly things like jerry lewis 
impressions throughout the movie when we got punchy we started 
doing jerry back and forth it kept us going its very important 
to be on the same wave length on a picture like this 
dead heat has had a lukewarm reception from both critics and 
audiences and it appears that piscopo hasnt quite found himself 
in films oddly his first three roles have been crimeoriented a 
wacky hit man in the gangster spoof johnny dangerously which 
starred michael keaton a mob errand boy with danny devito wise 
guys neither lighted up the boxoffice charts 
piscopo observed that graduates of saturday night live 
follow two courses in their film careers they either arrive with a 
bang such as the late john belushi and comedian eddie murphy or 
they have a slow buildup to the top such as dan aykroyd and chevy 
chase piscopo figures hes in the latter category 
the piscopo story began 36 years ago in passaic nj where his 
father was a lawyer the comic majored in surfing throughout much 
of his school life but managed to earn a degree in broadcasting at 
jones college in jacksonville fla he worked as a disc jockey and 
dinner theater actor but his comedy career really began when he 
started performing at the improvisation in new york 
the saturday night live producers liked his stuff and signed 
him in 1980 
it was pretty devastating piscopo recalled i had been 
doing very well at the improv and with television commercials on 
saturday night live we had to replace bill murray and danny 
aykroyd and gilda radner and it was an impossible task the show 
in its first year was an abomination real bad 
then it started to get exciting when i realized we were doing 
stuff that was good as ever 
the turning point may have come at a cast meeting when a 
producer with spray paint emblazoned danger on a blank wall 
piscopo followed the instruction stretching his own talent and 
sometimes good taste to the utmost 
he has portrayed so many characters that you wonder if the real 
joe piscopo will ever stand out he admitted that such portrayals 
may constitute a device not liking ones self being insecure 
its true i feel the most comfortable doing characters like in 
the beer commercials 
i liked dead heat because i was myself for the first time 
he said and i found myself feeling feeling comfortable lately 
ive been working out and staying physically fit and i feel more 
confidence with myself 
seeing him portray the late martial arts king bruce lee in the 
commercials you might think hes wearing a body suit those 
muscles are all piscopos 
a lot of people thought i was wearing prosthetics he said 
ive been working for 2 years i do it for my head the muscles 
are a residual result 
i want to do it for three or four more years and then ill 
just be one of those guys who swims every day

crocodile dundee ii is that rare bird a sequel that 
excels the original mind you the new film will not have the 
impact of crocodile dundee i which introduced us to one of 
the great character creations of film history 
paul hogans mick dundee was a masterpiece more credible than 
indiana jones more charming than james bond funnier than rambo 
the second coming of dundee finds him shacked up with sue 
charlton linda kozlowski in a new york penthouse enjoying his 
leisure not for long before he is murdered in colombia sues 
former husband dennis boutsikaris sends her photographs 
incriminating a drug baron hechter ubarry the powerful dopester 
and his vicious lieutenant juan fernandez kidnap sue and attempt 
to recover the photos 
dundee to the rescue accompanied by various street types the 
siege of the colombians new york castle is capra corn of the best 
vintage 
to escape their pursuers dundee and sue flee to his homeland 
enjoying a reunion with his pub pals the hoods follow of course 
kidnaping bumbling walter reilly john meillon and gathering some 
local toughs to track down mick and sue but the villains are no 
match for the wildernesswise dundee 
only in the latter stages does the filmmakers imagination 
falter our heros devices seem a bit labored especially in the 
assault of the bats 
paul hogan remains true to the crocodile image which is 
expectable since he wrote the script with his son brett happily 
they reversed the locales and the new york portion comes first 
australia last in the first movie the australian sequences were 
far more interesting than the familiar plot of a hick in the big 
city 
hogans longtime partner john cornell directed crocodile 
dundee ii and produced with jane scott he draws good 
performances from the cast especially the heavies ubarry and 
fernandez who are delightfully evil and meillon a kind of down 
under smiley burnette 
kozlowski has little to do but be supportive and frightened and 
she does both with great skill 
it is both sorrowful and heartening to learn that hogan plans to 
retire dundee forever he will be sorely missed but do we really 
need to see crocodile dundee goes to las vegas etc 
the paramount release is rated pg with not much content that 
would harm children running time 111 minutes

rated r 
 
in the principal james belushi plays a rambolike high 
school teacher who drinks too much smashes porsches with baseball 
bats and generally ticks off his bosses at the stuffy old board of 
education 
instead of firing him they decide to reward him with a 
principalship trouble is its at brandel high school the 
lowdown dirtiest most crimeinfested drugridden school on the 
planet 
the film misses no opportunity for gratuitous violence the kids 
dont just taunt or ignore him they beat him to a bloody pulp 
the teachers are assaulted and in finest spaghetti western 
fashion belushi riding his motorcycle into the very halls of 
brandel is going to tame this here school pardner 
there is a climactic chase scene and showdown in the girls 
shower this films ludicrous version of the ok corral 
even a graduate of brandel could predict the outcome of this 
absurd boring exploitative movie 
and even a better actor than belushi could have done little with 
such peabrained dialogue as this sample when he tries to inspire 
downtrodden teachers 
aw come on you people says he his voice rising 
pattonlike you cant pick and choose your students 
the film also features louis gossett jr muttering 
unintelligible cynicisms as the schools security guard 
tough schools lately seem to have caught hollywoods fancy 
unfortunately it is only the rare film such as the excellent 
stand and deliver that manages not to succumb to sexploitation 
or racist blackboard jungle caricatures 
the principal rated r contains the foul 
streetlanguage youd expect in a film such as this but not to 
worry the rest of the dialogue will probably put you to sleep

jacknifed columbia jean beauvoir 
 
in his 26 years jean beauvoir has packed wildly diverse 
experiences onto his musical resume including stints with the 
doowop flamingoes shock punkers plasmatics and little stevens 
political disciples of soul 
even beauvoirs appearance paints him as a musical maverick with 
the wild white mohawk hes sported for many years 
this personal history hardly prepares a listener for the musical 
conservatism of jacknifed beauvoirs second solo album 
jacknifed is a soulful contemporary dance album probably 
the first to be influenced by the success of terence trent darby 
the keyboards and guitars simmer but dont sizzle leaving room for 
beauvoirs songs to stretch and breathe 
both lyrically and musically beauvoir has the smarts to avoid 
tired cliches he also avoids anything distinctive that will get 
his songs noticed jacknifed is the type of record that would 
float by on the radio without causing any real reaction 
many of the songs such as standing on my own two feet and 
find my way home tread familiar themes of a solitary man trying 
to find his way in a hostile world 
beauvoir who wrote and produced the album along with playing 
most of the instruments has obvious talent hes still looking for 
the best way to show the world

the story of the clash vol 1 epic the clash 
 
they once advertised themselves as the only band that 
matters one member of the group was fired for political reasons 
the bands first hit single wasnt even listed on the cover of the 
london calling album 
who are the clash 
this onceimportant band dropped so quickly from the public 
consciousness it almost seems like theyve become a trivia 
question the time is ripe for a retrospective and epic records 
has obliged with the tworecord the story of the clash vol 1 
liking or hating the clash during their brief prime in the late 
1970s and early 80s was almost a political statement in itself 
punk rock set up two hostile camps one that loved the brash young 
toughs challenging the musical establishment the other threatened 
by them the bands aggressive workingclass politics also left 
little room for neutrality 
this often obscured the simple fact the clash was a terrific 
rock band one that quickly grew past the limitations of primitive 
punk but never lost the creative spark that went with it 
the retrospective while put together rather haphazardly makes 
that point abundantly clear 
the set cuts a wide swath through the glorious trash rock of 
should i stay or should i go the motown tribute train in 
vain the mainstream rock crunch of london calling the 
inspirational near ballad stay free and the adrenalin kick of 
janie jones 
oddly the record only includes two cuts from the sprawling 
threerecord sandinista cuts such as the title track or 
charlie dont surf would have been better than the subpar 
straight to hell included here from combat rock 
the record doesnt run chronologically side 3 is a tribute to 
the clashs infancy and side one sounds like a prototype for mick 
jones subsequent big audio dynamite group but the sequencing 
often seems random if not it would have been preferable to hear 
the band explain it through retrospective liner notes instead of 
the rambling reminiscence of a roadie included here 
still this is an illuminating trip through a time capsule and 
would make an especially worthy purchase for those who missed the 
clash the first time around

growing up in washington in the 1920s laughlin 
phillips had the paintings of pierre auguste renoir edgar degas 
claude monet paul cezanne and many more for company 
my father so much wanted other people to enjoy them that 
already in 1921 three years before i was born he opened two rooms 
to the public phillips recalled 
that was how our house became the first museum of modern art 
in america 
the phillips collection is still on public display in the home 
his parents owned on 21st street near dupont circle until it got so 
big that they had to leave their art work and move 
the outstanding assembly of mostly late 19th century and 20th 
century paintings was acquired by duncan phillips who inherited 
wealth from banking and steel and his wife marjorie who was a 
wellknown landscape and stilllife painter 
their son laughlin 63 a tall quietspoken retired diplomat 
is director of the collection which now belongs to a foundation 
seventysix of the 2000 paintings are at londons hayward 
gallery through aug 14 and then go to frankfurt and madrid in the 
collections first european show after having exhibitions in 
australia and japan 
the highlight is renoirs large colorful the luncheon of the 
boating party painted in 1881 after a good lunch at a river 
restaurant with convivial chatter and pretty women 
its renoirs masterpiece the finest thing he ever did 
said exhibition organizer catherine lampert a washingtonian who 
now lives in london she was about 2 years old when her father 
first took her to see the phillips collection 
the dazzling london show starts with el greco in the 16th 
century and ends with modern abstracts by sean scully frank stella 
and john walker 
there are van goghs a blue period pablo picasso and works 
by pierre bonnard edward hopper wassily kandinsky paul klee 
amedeo modigliani piet mondrian and winslow homer 
the trustees still acquire pictures but focus mainly on 
conservation improving the museum buildings and education helped 
by exhibition fees 
phillips said his father became interested in art at college 
he wrote about the history of art and tried to interpret what 
artists say on their canvases he gave that up later i think 
because of the difficulty of talking about abstract art phillips 
said 
they would bring new paintings home to test them and would 
send them back if they decided against them he recalled if they 
decided against them they would go back to the dealers 
my parents had remarkable taste and discernment and my father 
didnt follow any fashion and often paid just a few hundred dollars 
for a painting 
artists visited the family phillips remembers meeting the 
photographer alfred stieglitz a fiercelooking man with hair 
growing from his ears and huge eyebrows and steel glasses he 
expanded my fathers taste 
duncan phillips taste shifted and evolved but he was 
particularly fond of one painting now at the london show honore 
daumiers the uprising showing a young man arm outflung in a 
crowd 
it may have been inspired by the 1848 revolution in paris 
phillips said his father saw it as a symbol of mans aspirations 
and discontent 
my father didnt have great wealth but he felt he had 
inherited a lot and was going to give it back through his museum 
his father also painted for a while 
he went into rages when he couldnt get the color mix he could 
see in his mind he put oil paints on top of each other and they 
turned to mud he recalled 
dad would take mother to baseball to the washington senators 
he watched and she sketched one of her famous paintings is of a 
baseball game 
phillips said likes the way the hayward has blended american and 
french pictures 
my father loved that he said he said there should be no 
national boundaries in art art was independent of nationality 
artists were kindred spirits who spoke to each other not only 
across national boundaries but from century to century

brian setzer is sure people will like his new 
record but hes not sure how many will hear it 
setzer was the guitarist for the stray cats a rockabilly trio 
that had a number of hits in the early part of the decade but his 
first solo album this knife feels like justice released in 
1986 sold poorly despite good reviews 
it would have been a platinum album for someone else setzer 
said i was really trying to get way from being a stray cat i 
dont think i left enough of me in there 
with the release of live nude guitars setzer is hoping to 
win back some old fans and make some new ones 
i dont think ive found my own audience yet he said i 
think ive got to play on the road a lot and develop im going to 
get some crossover people who are just fans of the stray cats and 
kids who are curious 
i think this new record is really focusing in on who i am if 
i just get out there and play and show them a great show ill get 
a following 
chris thomas known for his work with the pretenders and the sex 
pistols and dave stewart of eurythmics each produced songs on the 
album fans of such pretenders songs as brass in pocket and 
talk of the town will recognize the guitar sound on every 
tear that falls 
it is very pretendersy said setzer he thomas layers 
on guitars after guitars and gets a big sound out of it 
every tear that falls was written with the everly brothers 
in mind but setzer decided to record it himself 
i kind of had this riff and i thought oh boy wouldnt it be 
great to write this song for the everly brothers that kind of 
harmony thing setzer said i know paul mccartney wrote one 
wings of a nightingale for them so i came up with this but i 
liked it so much i kept it 
stewart produced rockability setzers favorite song on the 
album 
its sort of a year2000 rockabilly song setzer said i 
want to make a pyschobilly album with lots of echo and 
distortion 
setzer was happy with both thomas and stewart although he found 
their styles very different 
working with dave stewart is instant setzer said he 
hears something he likes knows its good and just cuts it and its 
done working with chris thomas takes a long time but the end 
result is equally as pleasing 
i like working with both of them but im doing the next record 
with dave stewart 
stewart also produced the rain washed everything away a big 
ballad in the tradition of gene pitney or the righteous brothers 
the song was cowritten by stewart and setzer at stewarts house 
dave says lets write one of those ballads lets go out on 
the porch that will give us a title setzer said we get out 
on the porch and he says oh its a beautiful night and i say 
yeah the rain washed everything away and he says theres the 
title 
the righteous brothers would clean this up 
although the 28yearold setzer was born after the first wave of 
rock n roll hit in the 1950s he has always preferred the music 
of that period 
when i was going to high school even though it was the 70s 
it was still the leftover of the 60s it was hippie the flower 
thing setzer recalled i never connected with it i had long 
hair but when i was about 15 i just cut it all off 
i wanted to look like eddie cochran rather than jim morrison 
setzer still idolizes cochran who was killed in a car crash in 
1960 everything about eddie spoke rock n roll to me 
he covers a cochran hit nervous breakdown on the new album 
and portrayed him last year in the hit movie la bamba the 
story of ritchie valens another early rock star who died in a 
plane crash in 1959 with buddy holly and jp big bopper 
richardson 
i got a good feeling like i was the only one who could do 
it setzer said i was just me in the role 
but setzer has no intentions of pursuing a film career 
i dont enjoy acting people strive their whole lives to be 
actors i dont think someone should fall into it setzer said 
i liked playing my hero but i just dont feel i deserve to be an 
actor 
setzer wants to introduce a new generation to cochran and other 
rockers from the 50s 
most kids just turn on mtv music television and they see 
what they like he said gene vincent eddie cochran buddy 
holly theyre not around any more thats why im here those 
people cant speak to those kids i have to

writer margaret atwoods interests range far and 
wide from history to siamese twins to former tv evangelists jim 
and tammy bakker 
so extensive and eclectic is her knowledge that she can talk 
about literature in the years following the american revolution and 
also tell you which states have the highest populations of 
porcupines 
although best known for her highly acclaimed novel the 
handmaids tale atwood first gained recognition for her poetry 
her selected poems ii poems selected and new 197686 has just 
been released by houghton mifflin paperbacks 
there are poems about love and siamese twins and poems about 
poets 
theres a perception of their social role she said about 
her fellow poets it wasnt always that way but now people think 
you cant be a poet without being drunk women poets are expected 
to commit suicide someone once asked me when not if i would 
commit suicide 
i prefer to live thank you very much

from the words continue their journey a selection from 
1984s interlunar 
do poets really suffer more 
than other people isnt it only 
that they get their pictures taken 
and are seen to do it 
the loony bins are full of those 
who never wrote a poem 
most suicides are not 
poets a good statistic

atwood was born in 1939 in ottawa although one of her aunts 
claims that she announced her intentions to become a writer at the 
age of five atwood said she did not seriously begin writing until 
she was 16 
she was 19 when her first poem was accepted for publication her 
first volume of poetry persephone was published in 1961 in 
1966 a collection of poems entitled the circle game won the 
governor generals award as the years best book of poetry the 
circle game sold 10000 copies a then unheard of total in canada 
for works of poetry 
in 1960 in english canada there were five novels published 
you were doing very well to sell 1000 novels atwood said 
when my first poems were published they told me they had 
overprinted 450 copies instead of 400 
she has written several novels besides the handmaids tale 
including surfacing lady oracle and life before man 
she has released two collections of short stories two childrens 
books and several works of criticism notably 1972s survival 
an analysis of canadian literature she is currently completing a 
new novel cats eye 
atwood who lives in toronto travels frequently and credits 
this with helping her writing 
traveling takes me out of my environment she said it 
gives me clear time its not the same as being in the office with 
the phone ringing all day it also gives me context for my own 
country 
some parts of the world are more conducive for her writing than 
others england in the winter is a great place to write hawaii 
on the beach is not 
atwood became more politically involved in the 1970s her work 
displayed her interest in power how it works how people use it 
how people react to it 
in the poem marrying the hangman from her 1978 collection 
twoheaded poems she tells the story of a woman who is 
condemned to death by hanging for stealing her employers clothes 
and can only escape her fate by marrying the hangman 
she has been condemned to death by hanging a man may escape 
this 
death by becoming the hangman a woman by marrying the hangman 
but at the present time there is no hangman thus there is no 
escape 
there is only a death indefinitely postponed this is not 
fantasy it is history 
the poem is about the choices people must make when confronting 
an unjust system 
it depends on the circumstances sometimes you have no 
options other times you have more she said a woman 
undergoing sexual harassment at work has more options than the 
woman who must marry the hangman 
in the best of all possible worlds you wouldnt have to make 
these choices but its not the best of all possible worlds 
while atwood has been involved in a number of causes her 
greatest concern is the environment 
forests are being cut down if the forests are all gone we 
will choke to death she said the ozone layer is being 
destroyed this stuff is scary for everybody 
atwood is critical of american writers who fail to integrate the 
political world into their work although she cites el doctorow 
and marge piercy as notable exceptions 
in the united states writing is an individual thing she 
said its the only country where people believe that its 
natural for american writers a habit of mind 
however she does see this changing 
they live in a secure country i predict mark my words as 
the united states feels less secure youll see more integration in 
the writing she said 
a young person who wanted to become a writer asked me for 
suggestions on how to suffer atwood said everybody suffers 
you dont have to find ways to suffer just live youll suffer

singer mickey gilley whose earthy texas 
nightclub was the focus of the movie urban cowboy hasnt set 
foot in the honkytonk for two years 
and he hasnt regularly worn a cowboy hat for three years 
eight years after john travolta and costar debra winger 
launched a fad known as cowboy chic gilley has broken the ties 
that symbolized him as the country music singer most associated 
with the craze 
the 52yearold performer is in litigation over the nightclub in 
pasadena texas where most of the 1980 movie was filmed he claims 
an associate has let the cavernous club get run down 
i drive by the club all the time but ive not been in it for 
two years gilley said in a telephone interview the business 
has practically died the parking lot used to be full now you can 
count the cars i think its just a matter of time until it goes 
under 
and his cowboy hat part of the western attire that became 
fashionable because of the popularity of the movie has seen its 
last roundup 
ive got hair theres nothing to cover up gilley said i 
dont feel like a cowboy hat is something thats going to make or 
break my career people had fun with that era and i did too people 
wonder wheres my hat but i havent worn one now for three years 
people just havent seen me as much 
as one of the country music stars who sang in the movie gilley 
shot to the top in show business on the tails of cowboy chic 
he appeared in the dukes of hazzard the fall guy 
hollywood squares and fantasy island 
his concert fee rose from 5000 to 25000 one night he was 
paid 50000 for 90 minutes to perform at billy bobs nightclub in 
fort worth texas a club that has since closed as the fad tailed 
off 
gilley had six straight no 1 country hits in the early 1980s 
when the movement peaked his hits included stand by me true 
love ways and dont the girls all get prettier at closing 
time 
now the era is a memory just like the mechanical bulls featured 
in the movie 
everything has its day he said reflecting on the cowboy 
chic heyday nothing lasts forever people dont realize that 
the urban cowboy fad had gone on in texas for years and years 
people had fun with it when urban cowboy hit it affected 
the whole world travolta brought everything to front and center 
it was like a billboard going up 
had it not been for him playing that part it would not have 
had the impact he had done saturday night fever and this was 
country night fever it was a different lifestyle and it worked 
everyone became a cowboy or cowgirl it was like when the 
beatles came over and everyone grew their hair long and shook their 
heads everyone wanted to be part of what was happening ill 
remember it forever 
in the movie travolta learned how to ride a mechanical bull at 
the nightclub in order to win the favor of winger who was then a 
relatively unknown actress 
today gilley is not sure the devices were such a good idea 
they were contraptions ridden as one would a bull whose gyrating 
was controlled by an operator 
it was a rodeo training device and should never have been put 
in an entertainment establishment in the first place gilley 
said we still have suits pending over it 
nevertheless nightclubs such as gilleys sprang up across the 
country many of them with mechanical bulls some were converted 
discos and were patronized by customers in snappy cowboy hats 
shiny cowboy boots and stylish western wear 
i probably remember the impact on country attire the most 
gilley said it was the first time you could walk into a casino 
in las vegas or reno or lake tahoe or atlantic city and see guys in 
cowboy hats it changedthe mood it had its flash in the pan 
gilley whose cousins are rock n roll star jerry lee lewis and 
the rev jimmy swaggart has had 17 no 1 records in a 14year 
career 
hes on the road 115 days a year down sharply from his peak era 
i got to the point i wouldnt do golf tourneys he recalled 
back then it was money money money i was playing every place 
they threw in front of me 
i wish i had cut in half what i did i wanted to make as much 
money as quickly as i could it was like a dragon you feed it to 
keep it the fire was coming out of his mouth he said 
im happier with my performing now because im working less 
and ending up with more money than during urban cowboy because 
im able to do it with less people 
back then i had a lifestyle of airplanes and buses and 
trucks i did stupid things i prostituted myself for the money

for a glimpse of elementary science the way it 
should be taught but seldom is turn right after the sea lions at 
the bronx zoo 
there in makeshift classrooms ripe with the sounds and smells 
of ferrets falcons porcupines and snakes 30000 new york city 
elementary schoolchildren a year get a few hours to experience 
science the way scientists do by touching observing and 
experimenting 
instead of reading about it in some lifeless textbook second 
graders from ps 205 actually saw a ferret demonstrate its natural 
defense spinal flexibility that enables it to turn its long 
slender body completely around in a narrow plastic tube and face 
potential danger 
first we learned how the animals moved then we learned about 
their colors said gary beckles a firstgrader at ps 205 we 
saw a owl and a firebellied toad and we even touched a boa 
constrictor 
visitors from ps 29 another elementary school in the bronx 
felt the slimy back of a bullfrog for the first time in their lives 
after some coaxing from zoo instructor nikki schulak and 
learned about natural camouflage by studying the black and orange 
hide of a salamander 
the classes conducted by the bronx zoo are among 13 local 
science education programs cited as exemplary in a new us 
department of education publication science education programs 
that work for about 300 to 400 per class the program offers 
science training and materials for teachers and three to six class 
visits to the zoo for students in grades kindergarten through 6 
but the program is a rare bright spot in an otherwise dismal 
landscape of elementary school science around the country 
critics from us education secretary william j bennett on down 
say science as taught in many us elementary schools manages to 
replace childrens innate fascination with natures wonders with 
minddeadening facts and predictable textbook exercises 
masquerading as experiments 
experts cite several problems elementary teacher training that 
often bypasses or plays down science school systems that stress 
reading and math scores and consider science a frill by comparison 
failure by schools to make use of resources like planetariums and 
zoos and overreliance on textbooks that rarely offer genuine 
experimentation or grounding in scientific method 
the sorry state of elementary science instruction is the often 
overlooked reason that us students do so poorly in science later 
on in school compared with students in other industrialized 
countries 
us elementary and high school students especially girls know 
less about science than their counterparts did in 1970 according 
to a study released this year by the international association for 
the evaluation of educational achievement of how students in 24 
nations perform in science 
for example more than eight out of 10 us 5th graders in 1970 
correctly answered a multiple choice question on how long it takes 
to travel to the moon in 1986 only 47 percent of the 5th graders 
chose the correct answer a few days 
in an otherwise laudatory report on elementary education in 
1986 bennett singled out science instruction as a weak spot 
the report first lessons said the average fourth grader is 
lucky to get 30 minutes a day of science instruction and rarely 
does it include a taste of genuine lab work or experimentation 
we need a revolution in elementary school science said the 
bennett report there is probably no other subject whose teaching 
is so at odds with its true nature 
we have come to think of science as a grabbag of esoteric 
facts and stunts the periodic table the innards of frogs the 
way to make little hot plates out of tin cans and wires 
across the street from the bronx zoo at ps 205 teachers and 
administrators have struggled to include more science in the 
curriculum especially handson lessons featuring 
experimentation and visual demonstrations 
the elementary schools teachers bored with the standard 
science curriculum handed down by the central school board got 
together about three years ago and devised their own enriched 
curriculum which pooled their knowledge and downplayed the role of 
standard textbooks 
i remember that we were scared about science as teachers we 
were not science mavens said rosanne turits head early 
childhood teacher at ps 205 
but the school has no lab and science coordinator maryanne 
delgado must make do with a budget of just 250 for equipment like 
thermometers and magnifying glasses as a result handson 
science sometimes means a few minutes at the end of a lesson 
looking at light through a prism or the old perennial growing 
lima bean plants 
according to a littlepublicized report funded by the national 
science foundation last november 
the nations kindergartenthroughthird graders spend an 
average of 19 minutes per day on science increasing to 38 minutes 
in grades 46 
69 percent of kindergartenthroughthird grade teachers rely on 
textbooks rising to 89 percent by grades 46 
threequarters of kindergartenthroughthird grade classes get 
science lectures 87 percent have discussions but only half use 
handson materials or participate in lab work yet twothirds of 
science teachers agree or strongly agree that lab classes 
are more effective 
while 87 percent of elementary teachers took methods 
courses in teaching elementary science only three out of 10 took 
college level chemistry 17 percent took physics 58 percent took 
biology 
and in a recent critique of nine commonly used elementary 
science texts david l elliott and kathleen carter nagel 
codirectors of educational materials associates private textbook 
consultants in berkeley calif concluded that science programs 
relying on such texts teach students to think of science mainly 
as a collection of conclusions to be memorized 
such texts the critique said hardly mention much less 
explain the fundamental canons and methods of scientific 
inquiry the attitude of objectivity or the sometimes tedious 
pursuit of all leads inevitably including dead ends in 
scientific investigations 
real experimentation lays open many possible alternatives and 
answers 
but typically such texts offer recipes in place of genuine lab 
activity they lay out the goal state the materials needed give 
instructions and then provide the correct answer whats 
supposed to happen 
school science the elliott and nagel concluded is too 
often simply the pursuit of the known

a glowing green twoinchhigh stick 
figure reproducing the long jump or triple jump form of a carl 
lewis or willie banks is helping americas elite athletes go to 
great lengths 
the figure on the screen in james hays biomechanics laboratory 
at the university of iowa is a digital representation of movie film 
shot at 100 frames per second it is a computerized projection of 
horizontal and vertical acceleration angle of takeoff and body 
position in the air 
were trying to find the answers to some basic questions about 
jumping hay said we do a lengthy series of statistical 
analyses of the data out of that we put together a 40 to 50page 
report with a summary of findings and what we think the athlete 
needs in terms of practice what the coach and athlete might direct 
their attention to 
for example a 45page book prepared for triple jumper mike 
conley with data from tac championship meets in 1983 1985 1986 
and 1987 is crammed with data describing factors including 
velocity changes of center of gravity from touchdown to takeoff 
of the hop phase 
the athletes like to see the stick figure representations 
though 
these stick figures do tell them where they are in a 
particular part of the jump said dean hayes 1988 us olympic 
long and triple jump coach and a coach at middle tennessee state 
university for 23 years 
hayes said hays research funded by the us olympic 
committees elite athlete project is highly prized by jumpers 
they have confidence in him the olympic coach said 
before we gathered all this data but didnt know what to do with 
it were now giving the athlete and coach direct feedback hays 
really done a good job of that 
coach tom tellez who has worked with olympian carl lewis and 
his sister carol at the university of houston said hays analyses 
are valuable even when they only back up what the coach and jumper 
have been doing 
with carl and carol hes done some good work tellez said 
hes reinforced for me a lot of the things ive been doing for 
some other coaches and athletes he may have been even more 
valuable 
hay isnt out to replace coaches with his statistics and stick 
figures 
were only seeing one side of this from the films and 
analysis he said the coach sees this every day from many 
different angles 
he also wont take credit for improving any individuals 
performance 
if we work with an athlete and he or she improves dramatically 
later that year it may be because of what we said or it may be in 
spite of what we said theres no way of telling 
the only indication is what the athletes and coaches tell us 
what they tell us in general is that its very very helpful 
they keep coming back

seemingly healthy cocaine users who drop 
dead may be victims of the drugs interference with the hearts 
electrical activity 
researchers edward avakian and mark bracken at the university of 
the pacific injected rats and rabbits dosages equivalent to a 
160pound chronic abuser who smokes or injects 15 grams or 
snorts 3 grams of cocaine a day 
their studies suggest that cocaine causes sudden cardiac death 
by triggering abnormal heart rhythms said avakian a 
physiologistpharmacologist many cocaineinduced arrhythmias are 
temporary but others called ventricular arrhythmias kill because 
they halt the hearts ability to pump 
the findings also suggest that while longterm daily cocaine 
users develop tolerance to the drugs effects on the heart they 
are particularly susceptible to sudden death if they stop taking it 
and then resume 
cocaine is not always available so one might not take it for 
one or two days avakian said a brief withdrawal of one or two 
days can put a user at much more risk especially during a stress 
situation like exercise 
the risk of death from injecting cocaine or smoking its 
freebase or crack forms is particularly high because much 
more is absorbed into blood where it can directly affect the 
heart he said 
avakian bracken a physiologist and colleagues set out to 
explain such deaths as those in 1986 of university of maryland 
basketball star len bias and cleveland browns football player don 
rogers as of early 1987 there had been eight such deaths among 49 
documented cases of cocaineinduced heart trouble according to 
research by dr jeffrey isner of new england medical center 
avakian and bracken who outlined their work at a federation of 
american societies for experimental biology meeting last month 
used 40 rabbits and 300 rats some received no cocaine others got 
daily doses for eight weeks 
some of the animals were killed 30 minutes after the last 
injection others were killed two days later to simulate withdrawal 
from cocaine 
the hearts were removed and kept pumping in laboratory 
containers filled with a blood substitute while researchers 
monitored heart electrical activity blood flow through coronary 
arteries and heart rate rhythm and contractions 
then the researchers added cocaine alone or cocaine and 
adrenalin to the blood substitute bathing the hearts adrenalin 
normally is produced by the body during exercise or other physical 
or emotional stress 
hearts from animals that got cocaine before they were killed 
showed more disruption of electrical impulse transmission probably 
because cocaine acts as a local anesthetic avakian said 
the studies also showed chronic cocaine use when combined with 
adrenalin constricts coronary arteries reducing blood flow to the 
heart the combination of cocaineinduced arrythmias and the 
decreased blood flow increases the odds of sudden death he said 
hearts from animals withdrawn from cocaine for two days were 
supersensitive to adrenalin and cocaine suggesting sudden death is 
more likely in chronic abusers who stop and start again 
particularly if they exercise or are otherwise stressed

if your ultralowtar cigarette tastes better 
than you expect you may not be smoking it right and may be 
getting higher doses of tar say researchers who studied discarded 
cigarette butts 
fiftyeight percent of 135 cigarette filters found in ash trays 
at a shopping mall showed evidence that smokers had at least 
partially blocked the cigarettes air vents with their lips or 
fingers the researchers report 
ultralowtar cigarettes depend on those vents to dilute 
cigarette smoke and reduce the yield of tar blocking them raises 
the tar a smoker consumes the researchers wrote in junes american 
journal of public health 
smokers block vents to enhance smoking satisfaction some do 
not realize that better taste means increased tar nicotine and 
carbon monoxide thinking that there are special lowtar tobaccos 
in the cigarette other smokers are unaware of blocking the 
vents they wrote citing previous research 
smokers of lowtar cigarettes need to be told that if 
they do not miss their highyield cigarette smoke it may not 
really have gone away wrote lynn kozlowski marilyn pope and 
joann lux of the addiction research foundation in toronto and the 
university of toronto 
their study focused on characteristic tar stains created by 
ventblocking evidence of extreme blocking appeared in 19 percent 
with lesser blockage in 39 percent

nearly 40 percent of college coeds in a study 
report they had said no to sex when they meant yes but 
researchers say that since most of the women meant what they said 
men shouldnt ignore such refusals 
about a third of the women said they had offered this token 
resistance only once and 46 percent had used it only two to five 
times 
but since most women reported never offering such resistance 
the result does not mean that men can safely ignore womens 
refusals when a woman says no chances are that she means it 
and regardless of the incidence of token resistance if the woman 
means no and the man persists it is rape wrote texas aampm 
university researchers charlene muehlenhard and lisa hollabaugh 
they gave an anonymous questionnaire to 610 female students 
average age 19 at their school results appear in the may issue of 
the journal of personality and social psychology 
twentythree percent of the 240 coeds who offred token 
resistance said manipulative reasons such as gameplaying anger 
with the man or desire to be in control were at least moderately 
important reasons for resisting about an equal percentage cited 
such reasons as fear of appearing promiscuous fear of catching 
disease or uncertainty about their partners feelings

suramin a drug long used to treat parasite 
infections is being tested for the first time as a way to attack 
cancer 
doctors from the american cancer society used it on 10 people 
with advanced spreading cases of cancer of the adrenal gland 
although it did not cure their disease suramin seemed to slow the 
cancer by blocking body chemicals known as growth factors 
tumors need these substances to promote their own growth 
we believe that suramin is the first of a class of growth 
factorinhibiting drugs said dr cy a stein even if it is 
not the ideal drug it is helping us to learn what scheme is 
necessary to stop tumors from growing by inhibiting their growth 
factors 
in two of the patients tumors were reduced by more than 50 
percent while those in two others decreased by 25 to 50 percent 
the disease remained stable in three while progressing in three 
stein said that once the drug was stopped the cancer recurred 
rapidly doctors are now considering trying suramin on other forms 
of cancer and combining it with standard chemotherapy drugs 
the most serious side effect was nerve damage which doctors 
said may limit how long people can stay on suramin 
the results were reported at a recent meeting of the american 
society of clinical oncology

tiny beads coated with cancerkilling drugs 
are being tested to slow progression of liver cancer a uniformly 
fatal disease 
the treatment called chemoembolization uses beads of starch 
that have been treated with chemotherapy medicines to temporarily 
dam up the hepatic artery the major artery that supplies the liver 
this deprives the tumor of blood while putting it in contact 
with drugs doctors say the combination can stop the growth of the 
tumor and sometimes shrink it 
in a few days the starch is absorbed into the body and blood 
flow resumes during the temporary blockade the liver continues to 
receive blood through the portal vein 
among 30 patients who received the experimental treatment at the 
university of california san francisco two had dramatic 
responses one had no recurrence of the tumor for 16 months and the 
other for over two years in about threequarters the tumor shrank 
significantly or temporarily stopped growing 
dr alan venook who outlined the results at a recent american 
society of clinical oncology meeting said the new treatment 
provides temporary relief from the spread of the disease but is not 
a cure 
it is better than anything else around he said some 
patients have shown remarkable improvement but the therapy needs 
further development

at hyatt hotel corp in chicago executives are 
basking in government praise of their model compliance with the new 
immigration law which makes it illegal to knowingly hire 
undocumented aliens 
but on the texas border a mexican fastfood chain fears 
possible raids by the immigration and naturalization service 
and in southern california a waterbedframe factory is 
challenging what it calls abusive and arbitrary ins inspection 
tactics in the first significant court test of the new laws 
sweeping employersanction provisions 
as the wednesday deadline looms for enforcement of those 
sanctions employers and immigration lawyers are giving the law and 
the ins a mixed review 
many say the agency has shown extraordinary tolerance and the 
new documentation requirements for employees are only a minor 
nuisance others contend immigration officers have failed to 
educate a large number of businesses and the paperwork is 
horrendously confusing 
my sense is that many employers arent complying with the 
law said ilene f lainer immigration specialist at the law firm 
of grotta glassman amp hoffman in roseland nj a lot of 
companies fell through the cracks 
stuart h bompey immigration lawyer at the new york firm of 
baer marks amp upham said large employers are complying because they 
are more sophisticated than smaller businesses and have the 
resources to efficiently keep records 
the little guy who runs the small garment shop or something 
like that probably isnt in compliance and wont be in 
compliance he said its the same as noncompliance with 
overtime laws until somebody knocks on his door 
some predict the ins will stage zealous enforcement raids after 
the wednesday expiration of the 11month phasein period during 
which it only issued warnings to first offenders and stressed 
voluntary compliance 
my impression is there will be a lot happening after june 1 
said h ronald klasko presidentelect of the american immigration 
lawyers association and coauthor of an employers guide to 
compliance with the new law 
the november 1986 immigration reform and control act requires 
the nations 8 million employers to document the legal status of 
employees hired after the law was signed with a new form called 
the i9 employers must fire those who cannot prove work 
eligibility 
employer penalties range from 250 to 2000 per worker for 
first offenses to 10000 per worker and 6 months in jail for 
repeated violations failure to do the paperwork can result in 
fines ranging from 100 to 1000 per violation 
ins spokesman duke austin said visits to employers nationwide 
suggest that about 90 percent are in compliance or nearly so 
were encouraged by that because we know the only way this 
law is going to work will be to have compliance austin said 
we dont have the resources to visit 8 million employers 
he declined to characterize the postwednesday policing effort 
as a crackdown but said that i think youre going to see more 
enforcement 
despite earlier grumblings about an additional bureaucratic 
nuisance some large employers are now praising the ins for 
explaining how the law works 
the ins in turn has sought to establish good relationships 
with many businesses and publicly compliments model followers of 
the new law 
for example at hyatt which like other big hotel chains 
historically has attracted undocumented aliens for lowpay 
positions there was some initial fear about its ability to employ 
qualified workers but the company asked for ins assistance to 
comply and received an award from the agency 
some smaller businesses also have found it relatively easy to 
comply after initial complaints 
murray rosenzweig president of linden maintenance corp a taxi 
company in new york predicted last year that the new law would be 
a nightmare because of his constantly changing work force but 
he changed his mind 
it hasnt developed into a major problem anymore he said 
its become more of a routine not a burden as i see it 
but fear toward the new law and the ins prevail along the 
southern us border where most illegals enter the country 
at el pato mexican food enterprises in mcallen texas manager 
ralph nunez worries about surprise inspections at the fast food 
chain 
weve been trying our darndest to comply with the law he 
said but what if they come in unannounced while a recently hired 
person is working for us and we still dont have the proper 
documentation in our office if theyre going to pounce on us then 
were in trouble 
ins tactics have been the focus of a court case in which mester 
manufacturing a 70worker waterbedframe maker in el cajon 
calif challenged the agencys determination that it knowingly and 
repeatedly hired illegals 
arguments before an administrative law judge revealed that ins 
officers who searched the factory might have abused their authority 
and ignored earlier company requests for help in complying with the 
law 
the judge was pretty disgusted with a lot of this stuff 
said attorney peter larrabee theyre trying to stick it to 
employers it takes an employer like my client that gets incensed 
to fight big brother 
under a special provision for farmers who employ migrant 
laborers full enforcement will not begin until late this year but 
there is widespread fear among many growers that the law will make 
it hard to find harvesting help 
in eastern oregon for example strawberry farmers have planted 
only one third the usual acreage this year fearing they can no 
longer rely on the large numbers of illegal mexican migrants who 
have come every season 
roy malensky head of oregon berry packing co said 
everyones concerned that if we plant em whos going to pick 
em

the government today urged leading corporations to 
boost imports of manufactured goods in an effort to reduce japans 
massive trade surplus 
in a meeting with representatives of 151 firms minister of 
international trade and industry hajime tamura requested the 
companies make further efforts to expand the increase of foreign 
imports said atsushi kawashima director of the import division 
of mitis international trade administration bureau 
japans trading partners have called on the country to curtail 
exports and promote imports in an effort to slash its heavy global 
trade surplus 
kawashima said imports of manufactured goods rose from 552 
billion in fiscal 1986 to 739 billion in fiscal 1987 fueled 
mainly by the rapid appreciation of the japanese yen 
since september 1985 the yen has risen by more than 100 percent 
against the us dollar the higher value of the yen has made 
japanese products more expensive overseas but has tended to 
increase the import purchasing power of japanese 
the companies should take advantage of the yens 
appreciation to the greatest extent kawashima quoted tamura as 
telling the firms representatives during the onehour meeting at 
the ministry 
according to finance ministry figures japans trade surplus 
last fiscal year totaled 7601 billion down from 8974 billion 
in fiscal 1986 the decrease was the first in six years 
kawashima said the government hopes to reduce the trade surplus 
by another 11 billion this fiscal year which ends next march 31 
he said the call for more imports also was made by ministry 
officials to 151 other firms for a total of 302 companies which 
represent the core of the japanese economy 
the corporations including big trading houses such as mitsui 
and co sumitomo corp and c itoh and co were responsible for 
60 percent of the total fiscal 1987 import figure he said the 
companies as a group increased their imports last year by 38 
percent and hope to increase them by a further 17 percent in fiscal 
1988 he said 
kawashima said tamura also requested the companies to report at 
the end of the first half of fiscal 1988 on the results of their 
import expansion programs

sales of new singlefamily homes rose 4 
percent in april to the highest level in a year the government 
said today 
in a joint release the departments of commerce and of housing 
and urban development said new singlefamily homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of of 679000 last month up from 
the march pace of 653000 
it was the third consecutive monthly increase and the highest 
level since new homes were sold at a rate of 728000 in april 1987 
despite the recent increases sales for the first four months of 
this year are still 9 percent below the same period of 1987 when 
mortgage interest rates hit nineyear lows 
the april climb came atop a modest 12 percent rise in march and 
a whopping 114 percent rise in february however the increases 
followed three consecutive declines in november december and 
january which analysts at the time said were caused by the 
october stock market crash 
some economists had feared that the downturn in housing sales 
signaled a recession but since then the economy has proved to be 
robust and the housing sector has more than recovered 
most analysts though believe that sales levels of the last few 
months will drop by the fall as rising mortgage interest rates push 
up the monthly cost of owning a home and discourage buyers 
rates on 30year fixedrate conventional mortgages averaged 
1058 percent last week more than half a percentage point higher 
than levels in february and march 
the increase in sales of new homes was accompanied by a rise in 
prices the median or midpoint price of new homes was 110500 
in april up 33 percent from march the average price of a new 
home rose 42 percent in april 
however the increases came after two consecutive monthly price 
declines which analysts had said reflected the reentry into the 
market of firsttime home buyers who normally purchase less 
expensive homes 
sales increased in all regions of the country in april they 
were up 59 percent in the midwest 55 percent in the west 29 
percent in the south and 28 percent in the northeast 
in a separate report last week the national association of 
realtors said sales of existing homes increased 45 percent in 
april after identical increases of 25 percent in march and 
february

stock traders came back from the threeday 
memorial holiday weekend in a good mood pushing prices broadly 
higher in active dealings today analysts said the market was 
cheered by the ability of the bond market to shrug off a rise in 
commodity prices today 
volume was strong but more than half of the shares traded on 
the new york stock exchange involved the stocks of two utility 
companies whose dividend eligibility dates are approaching 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which fell 1031 
points on friday was up 2525 at 198169 at noon on wall street

issues traded on the nyse with 895 up 366 down and 468 unchanged 
big board volume came to 15737 million shares as of noontime 
compared with 8835 million shares at the same point in fridays 
session 
the pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders 
have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of 
continuing strength in the economy 
while a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits 
some observers worry that an expanding economy could also reignite 
inflation 
charles jensen a technical analyst for mki securities corp 
said the commodity research bureaus index of selected commodity 
prices was up about 5 points at midday a relatively strong advance 
that might normally stir inflation fears 
but he said when the bond market declined only slightly traders 
who had sold borrowed stocks in anticipation that they could buy 
them later at lower prices panicked and bought stocks 
some people saw that as a good sign that the market failed 
to respond to bad news he said 
eldon a grimm a senior vice president at the brokerage birr 
wilson securities inc said there is an enormous amount of cash 
around out of the market due to wariness in the wake of last 
octobers crash 
but every time we get a little rally going people think they 
will miss the boat and buy something he said

during the 1960s it was common for young couples 
to buy a relatively lowpriced first house which was a subtle 
way of letting you know they really aspired to much better things 
a few years later having acquired some equity they moved to a 
more commodious dwelling in what they considered a better 
neighborhood one they felt was more in keeping with their view of 
themselves 
while the motive was snobbish the results often were quite 
practical the better house in a better neighborhood might rise 
sharply in value as many of them did during the inflated 1970s 
smart move 
now something quite different is taking place rather than 
moving many young couples are staying put fixing up the old house 
to suit their needs and in the process saving themselves a lot of 
headaches and dollars 
look around the old neighborhood and youll see the evidence 
new rooms decks energyefficient doors and windows swimming 
pools in some instances small houses are almost encased by 
additions twice the size 
and once again the reasons for so doing make sense 
two big factors are at work 
1 many families prefer to stay put for financial and 
socialcultural reasons 
by remaining they save various closing costs taxes legal 
fees moving expenses and the like they are able to retain ties to 
churches schools and other organizations and the home might be 
more convenient to work 
2 a percentage of families that once might have sought new 
homes in new developments as in the 1960s might be more inclined 
now to move into homes in existing neighborhoods fixing up to meet 
their specific needs 
influencing such behavior might be the surge in newhome prices 
contrasted with bargain prices that sometimes can be found for 
fixup houses in older but still desirable neighborhoods 
whatever the reasons expenditures for residential remodeling in 
the past three years have exceeded 270 billion and about 200 
billion is expected to be added to that total by the end of 1989 
last year according to a preliminary estimate by the census 
bureau 941 billion was spent on alterations and repairs while 
this was only 31 percent higher than in 1986 it was triple the 
amount spent 10 years earlier 
martin azola chairman of the of the national association of 
realtors remodeling council believes the pace will quicken to 98 
billion this year and to more than 100 billion in 1989 
of 77 million people born during the postworld war ii baby 
boom about half own their homes azola says he observes that 
while many have been trading up others are staying put and 
upgrading 
the upgrading trend doesnt seem to be a reflection of a tougher 
housing market as some market analysts contend it appears not to 
be solely if at all a consequence of couples being unable to make 
any other choice 
in fact the remodeling splurge might even be related to the 
strong sales that have persisted during the past five years 
azola for example cites a study by the joint center for 
housing studies at harvard university which found that half of all 
remodeling expenditures are by people who have moved during the 
previous five years 
when people move into an existing home they often want to 
make alterations azola says adding so when an existing home 
is sold there is a good chance that a remodeling job will occur in 
the near future

computer assembly might seem unlikely in 
the middle of the nations largest national forest but the 
southeast alaska village of angoon has programmed its future in 
microchips 
the village native corporation kootznoowoo inc rented an 
empty building in town trained a dozen new employees and went to 
work this spring building ibmcompatible computers from imported 
components 
almost 50 units have been produced at the plant which has totem 
poles in front and hightech electronic gear inside federal 
agencies and corporations have been the main customers but a 
retail shop two blocks from the state capitol also offers the 
computers to the public 
the kootznoowoo board of directors has had a policy of trying 
to promote economic development in angoon said ron hawk 
controller of the corporations computer subsidiary electronics 
immediately came to the top of the list 
the electronics industry is an industry you can add a lot of 
value to and not pay a lot of freight hawk said 
electronic parts dont weigh much and that holds down freight 
costs for the companys operation on an island more than 800 miles 
north of seattle environmental concerns also played a part in the 
decision anything having to do with electronics is a clean 
industry hawk said 
angoon a village of about 600 people on admiralty island in the 
tongass national forest is 60 miles south of the state capital at 
juneau freight from the lower 48 must come first to juneau and 
then move by barge boat or plane to angoon 
kootznoowoo inc was established under the 1971 alaska native 
claims settlement act which distributed money and land to alaska 
natives to settle claims against the federal government the act 
established 13 regional and about 200 village corporations to 
manage the property 
kootznoowoos nearly 700 shareholders are tlingit indians 
twothirds of whom still live on admiralty an island almost 80 
times the size of manhattan the corporations assets totaled 33 
million as of the end of the past fiscal year 
kootznoowoo is the tlingit word for admiralty it translates to 
fortress of the bears in reference to the islands large 
population of brown bear 
alaska native corporations have gone into construction mining 
timber seafood real estate and oil exploration services but this 
is the first venture into computers hawk said 
as far as he has been able to determine from federal officials 
kootznoowoo is the first indian corporation in the country to 
assemble computers the bureau of indian affairs has purchased 
several of the computers and an order is expected soon from the 
us public health service 
timber is the companys only other business hawk said although 
the board is looking at entering the tourism and seafood processing 
industries 
the corporation a year ago established kootznoowoo government 
services inc as a subsidiary to develop new businesses and jobs 
for its shareholders as its first venture kgs this winter leased 
an empty 1800squarefoot building from the city for use as a 
computer assembly plant 
the building was put up six years ago for use as a museum but 
the city never had money to operate it and it sat empty for five 
years 
if we had to factor in the cost of building a plant we 
probably never would have considered the idea hawk said the 
building was constructed with humidity temperature and dust 
controls to protect artifacts making it perfect for electronics 
work 
kgs president ed gamble said 30 people applied when the company 
advertised in the village for computer assembly jobs a dozen 
people were hired and trained the building remodeled and the 
first 12 computers were built all for a startup cost of a little 
over 20000 gamble said 
kootznoowoo inc provided 50000 as an initial line of credit 
for its subsidiary gamble said additional money was contributed 
later 
memory chips are getting very expensive hawk said a 
worldwide microchip shortage has driven up prices and although 
kootznoowoo is physically isolated from silicon valley it faces 
the same market pressures as the rest of the industry 
the company offers two models marketed under the names kgs 
wolfat and wolf386 
the computers are named in honor of the late corporation 
president ivan gamble sr who died last year in a traffic 
accident he was a member of the wolf clan and his indian name 
meant wolf who cries in the wilderness 
although kgs employees assemble the computers the monitors and 
keyboards are purchased intact hawk said the company could 
assemble those items too if it had enough sales volume to justify 
the expansion 
the kgs building has room for 20 work stations it is designed 
so that one person does all the assembly of the machine hawk 
said rather than operating as an assembly line 
if expectations of federal contracts corporate purchases and 
increased retail sales come true the company hopes for sales of 
100 units a month by the end of the year our main focus has been 
government offices in the lower 48 he said 
production of 100 units a month would result in annual revenues 
exceeding 2 million not even a nick out of ibms blue chip 
stock but big business for a village of 600 people

the supreme court ruled today that the bulk of 
socalled gray market goods are legal giving a green light to 
a big part of a multibilliondollar business that allows consumers 
to buy costly brandname imports at steep discounts 
in another case the court ruled that states sometimes may 
execute convicted murderers even if theirright to a 
lawyers help was violated 
in constitutional splintered voting the justices upheld parts of 
us customs 
service regulations that permit gray market products into the 
country without approval from trademark owners 
the court also struck down part of the customs service rules 
thereby limiting somewhat the availability of the discount goods 
but some justices said those rules only apply to a small part of 
the dispute decided today 
the exact size of the gray market is unclear estimates have 
ranged from 5 billion to 10 billion a year 
the declining value of the dollar reducing its purchasing power 
abroad may have dampened the market but the business still 
appears to be thriving 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said a keyersity 
of georgias college of veterinary 
medicine nettles helped write the usda report and is formulating 
regulations to use as a model for state governments 
there are disease implications there are human safety 
implications which make the headlines read big a kid gets eaten 
by a polar bear in new york and theres the escape factor which 
from a naturalist point of view is very important 
but the debate between exotic animal dealers and animal rights 
activists rages most fiercely over the moral issue is is right or 
wrong to put wild animals in a cage and does captivity ensure a 
species survival or hasten its death 
i believe animals are here for our use but not our abuse 
says hoctor theres nothing wrong with owning a pair of ostrich 
boots if were culling ostrich males however if in our smug 
admiration of ourselves we rape nature and make those animals 
endangered so we can have a pair of ostrich boots thats wrong 
others believe there is no reason to exploit a wild animal when 
there are plenty of domestic animals that already provide 
companionship food and warmth 
that type of thinking justifying the exploitation of animals 
by juding them as an economic resource is going to lead to more 
and more species becoming endangered says herbet animals have 
an intrinsic value and ecological value you shouldnt have to put 
a dollar value on it to ensure its survival

soybean futures prices soared the 
30centsabushel limit allowed for daily trading tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade in response to the midwests hot dry 
weekend and predictions for more of the same 
grain futures also closed sharply higher 
weathers the story thats the whole ball game said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
as soybean planting nears completion fears are intensifying 
that a drierthannormal summer could lead to tight supplies next 
year analysts said the spring planting season has been unusually 
dry 
wheat corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of 
little rain but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made 
that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions 
tuesdays gains brought the nearmonth soybean contract for 
delivery in july to within easy striking range of 8 a bushel for 
the first time since the spring of 1984 
eight of the nine soybean contracts were up the limit as was 
the contract for march 1989 delivery of corn which carries a 
10centsabushel limit some oat futures traded up their 10cent 
limit during the session but closed below those highs 
at the close wheat was 9 cents to 15 cents higher with the

contracting for new construction projects 
declined 6 percent in april from the previous month extending a 
downward slide that began last fall a report released tuesday said 
the survey by the fw dodge division of mcgrawhill 
information systems co estimated the annualized value of all 
newly started construction projects in april at 22697 billion 
compared with 24238 billion in march 
fw dodge said its seasonally adjusted index of construction 
contracting fell to 144 in april from 154 in march a threemonth 
low the index is based on a level of 100 for 1982 
the april drop was the latest in a series of industrywide 
setbacks that began early last fall when building activity was 20 
percent above its current level 
george a christie vice president and chief economist for fw 
dodge said high vacancy rates in commercial properties 
particularly offices and apartments were responsible in reversing 
the industrys fiveyear upswing 
he said the situation was not expected to improve in the near 
term 
the export boom which is pumping up the 1988 economy isnt 
much help to the construction industry and could even prove 
troublesome christie said as economic activity heats up 
rising interest rates imply still lower building later in the 
year 
contracting for residential buildings slid 7 percent in april to 
an annualized value of 1094 billion due largely to a decline in 
apartment construciton according to the report 
april contracts for nonresidential building was off 5 percent 
to 768 billion from 8086 billion the value of nonbuilding 
contracts which include public works and utility projects fell 6 
percent to 4081 billion from 4359 billion the report said

usairs schedules were disrupted again tuesday 
as some flight attendants continued to refuse to work overtime in 
apparent protest of an impasse in contract negotiations 
the airline based in arlington va canceled 24 flights in its 
first eight hours of operation tuesday said spokesman dave shipley 
its a very very small percentage of the total shipley 
said theres not chaos at the airports 
usair schedules about 1600 flights daily shipley said 
he said usair canceled one flight saturday 81 flights sunday 
and 61 flights monday 
an impasse in contract negotiations between usair and the 
association of flight attendants apparently prompted the airlines 
flight attendants to decline overtime 
usair has yet to complete an agreement for a new contract and 
seniority list with its flight attendants and those employed by 
pacific southwest airlines which was acquired by usair last year 
and merged into usairs system april 9 
apparently there is a protest but its not a 
unionorganized protest i think its a spontaneous protest i was 
as surprised as anyone else said juliette lenoir vice president 
of the washington dcbased union and a usair flight attendant 
my best sense is that flight attendants are just very upset at 
this whole issue of pay parity for the former psa flight 
attendants that may have been the straw that broke the camels 
back she said 
ms lenoir said usair also has been asking attendants to do more 
work such as serving travelers before takeoff without a raise in 
pay since at least 1985 
shipley said most passengers booked for the canceled flights 
were accommodated on usair flights or on other airlines he said 
two classes of about 40 new flight attendants each were assigned to 
flights to help 
shipley said flight attendants overtime is governed by federal 
regulations which limit them to 85 hours per month he said flight 
attendants may fly five extra hours per month as overtime at the 
request of airlines but they are not required to do so

a new pasteurizing process that gives 
liquid eggs a threemonth shelf life may provide a cheap 
alternative to conventional eggs and the frozen variety officials 
said tuesday 
richard olson president and chief executive officer of michael 
foods inc of minneapolis called the process developed at north 
carolina state university a breakthrough in the handling of egg 
products 
under an agreement with nc state patents for the 
ultrapasteurization and aseptic packaging process are licensed to 
morning glory eggs inc of richfield a subsidiary of michael 
foods nc state received a 100000 royalty check tuesday and 
will get 2 percent of royalties from future sales 
douglas ford vice president for morning glory eggs said the 
new product should be available within 12 months 
liquid eggs would be far superior to frozen products currently 
on the market because producing shipping and storing liquid eggs 
is nine times more efficient than with frozen eggs ford said 
i dont know whether the entire savings will translate into 
lower costs but it should certainly provide a significant 
savings he said 
in order to extend a shelf life of seven to 10 days nc state 
researchers developed a way to heat the eggs on the run through 
tubes said kenneth swartzel associate professor of food science 
the heat kills diseasecausing and spoilage bacteria without 
coagulating the egg 
the egg mixture is then packaged in sterile containers ranging 
from small easypour cartons to huge bags for commercial bakeries 
and fastfood restaurants 
for restaurants now using eggs in the shell switching from 
using shell eggs would provide an added layer of protection from 
possible contamination from shells or packaging materials said 
hershell ball jr professor of food science for those using 
frozen eggs the new product will be more convenient while 
consuming less energy 
swartzel said michael foods is working with researchers to 
remove cholesterol from eggs either by changing the diets of hens 
or through a chemical process 
when that technology becomes commercially available we will 
be in a position to protect the integrity of that product all the 
way to the shelf he said 
olson said the technology could help an industry hurt by health 
concerns over cholesterols influence on heart disease 
were turning what most people in the egg industry regarded as 
a problem into an opportunity said olson 
harold ford president of the georgiabased southeastern poultry 
and egg association praised the process saying it will benefit 
the middleman and provide labor savings for the food service 
industry its as close to being sterile as any egg product 
thats available 
michael foods is spending 43 million to expand a minnesota 
plant to accommodate the new process and may spend another 2 
million to 4 million for similar work at a nebraska plant olson 
said

the stock market posted one of its strongest 
advances of the year today as traders went on a postmemorial 
holiday buying spree 
analysts said there was no single piece of economic news to 
account for the surge but said traders appeared to be betting that 
interest rates are approaching a peak for the time being 
the pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders 
have demonstrated little conviction about the implications of 
continuing strength in the economy 
while a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits 
some investors worried that an expanding economy could also 
reignite inflation 
but analysts said the market was heartened that the federal 
reserve had failed to raise its discount rate the interest on its 
loans to financial institutions last week after the markets had 
closed 
some of the buying in todays session they said came from 
traders who had speculated that the fed would push interest rates 
yet higher and had sold borrowed stocks last week in anticipation 
that they could buy them back later at cheaper prices 
once stock prices began rising today analysts said some of 
these traders bought stocks to cover those positions and other 
investors climbed aboard 
the analysts said the markets performance was remarkable in 
view of a rise in commodity futures prices which might normally 
stir inflation fears

stock prices shot up tuesday in a postholiday 
weekend buying spree that pushed up the dow jones industrial 
average nearly 75 points 
analysts could not point to any specific developments to account 
for the rally but they said sentiment seemed to have grown that 
interest rates are near a peak for the time being anxiety over 
rising interest rates had weighed heavily on the market in recent 
weeks 
prices began rising as soon as trading resumed after the 
threeday break for the memorial day holiday and gathered momentum 
as the day wore on 
the dow industrials rose 7468 points to close at 203112 that 
was the widely followed barometers best gain since a 7642 rise on 
jan 4 and the sixth biggest increase ever 
four stocks rose in price for every one that fell on the new 
york stock exchange 
the pace of trading has slowed in recent weeks as investors have 
shown little conviction on the implications of continuing strength 
in the economy while a strong economy could be a boon for 
corporate profits some investors have worried that the expanding 
economy could also reignite inflation 
but analysts said tuesday that traders were heartened the 
federal reserve had not increased the interest rate it charges on 
loans to financial institutions there had been speculation it 
would do so after the markets closed friday

investors that interest rates were approaching a shortterm peak 
gold prices also rose republic national bank said gold bullion 
was bid at 45430 a troy ounce at 4 pm edt up from 451 late 
friday 
traders in the currency markets returning from a long weekend 
said the dollar was drawing its strength from firm interest rates 
in the credit markets although rumors of an imminent move to 
tighten credit by the federal reserve did not materialize traders 
remained encouraged by the us interest rate environment 
the federal funds rate representing the charge for overnight 
loans between banks traded at 7 percent up from 7 late friday 
the general sense of the market is that while interest rates 
are firm the dollar will put in a better performance said james 
t mcgroarty a vice president with discount corp 
the dollar proved resilient enough to withstand an early move by 
the west german central bank to sell dollars to keep it in line 
with other currencies traders noted the bundesbank sold 74 
million as the dollar moved above the psychologically important 
level of 172 west german marks 
some investors had been counting on the fed to push interest 
rates higher at the end of last week by raising its discount loan 
rate to member banks when that didnt happen after the close of 
the financial markets friday some traders became convinced 
interest rates might be peaking the result was a postmemorial day 
rally in stock prices and the dollar 
the moves were unusual traders said because they came against 
a backdrop of rising commodity prices including gold and a drop 
in the yield of longterm government bonds 
the dollar closed in tokyo at 12480 japanese yen down from 
mondays 12498 yen in later london trading it rose to 12550 yen 
and in new york it was quoted at 125235 yen up from 124925 late 
friday 
the dollar also gained against the british pound in london 
where it was quoted late tuesday at 18385 compared with 18478 
in europe on monday and 18570 in london late friday london 
financial markets also were closed monday for a national holiday 
in new york the pound fetched 18353 tuesday compared with 
185735 late friday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late friday 
included 173265 west german marks up from 17178 144525 swiss 
francs up from 14358 58300 french francs up from 57770 
128400 italian lire up from 127313 and 12333 canadian 
dollars down from 123915 
late dollar rates in london compared with late mondays rates 
included 17292 west german marks up from 17270 14437 swiss 
francs up from 14415 58215 french francs up from 58025 
19333 dutch guilders down from 19335 127995 italian lire 
down from 128000 and 12357 canadian dollars down from 12378 
gold prices around the world got a boost from big gains in the 
platinum market the late bid price in london was 45480 a troy 
ounce up from late fridays 452 in zurich gold closed at a bid 
455 up from late mondays 45250

commodity prices surged broadly tuesday propelling a key 
inflation indicator to a threeyear high and suggesting the 
nations financial markets have reached a crossroads analysts said 
advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans corn oats 
hogs pork bellies and platinum spurred the commodity research 
bureaus index of 21 commodities to a 550point gain the index 
settled at 24839 its highest mark since february 1985 said 
stuart shinbein senior technical analyst for the private new 
yorkbased advisory service for commodities traders 
futures on wheat hogs cattle oil gold silver stocks and 
bonds also moved higher 
a concurrent rise in stockindex and us treasury bond futures 
is unusual such occurrences historically mark turning points in 
the financial markets shinbein said 
my feeling is that stocks are coming out of an oversold 
condition and commodities are moving into an overbought 
condition he said such a scenario would call eventually for a 
sharp drop in commodities prices 
analysts could cite no single reason behind tuesdays sharp 
gains but the the buying surges appeared to hit the markets in 
domino fashion beginning with grains and soybeans 
soybean futures opened and closed up the 30centsabushel limit 
allowed for daily trading on the chicago board of trade in response 
to the midwests hot dry weekend and predictions for more of the 
same 
weathers the story thats the whole ball game said victor 
lespinasse a trader with the investment firm dean witter reynolds 
inc in new york 
the agriculture department reported soybean planting was about 
74 percent finished as of sunday traders fear a drierthannormal 
summer could lead to tight supplies next year analysts said 
wheat corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of 
little rain but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made 
that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions 
tuesdays gains brought the nearmonth soybean contract for 
delivery in july to within easy striking range of 8 a bushel for 
the first time since the spring of 1984 
eight of the nine soybean contracts finished limit up as did 
the contracts for september and december delivery of oats and march 
delivery of corn both of which carry a 10centsabushel limit 
wheat settled 9 cents to 15 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 351 a bushel corn was 7 cents to 10 cents 
higher with july at 224 a bushel oats were 9 cents to 10 cents 
higher with july at 182 a bushel soybeans were 18 cents to 30 
cents higher with july at 798 a bushel 
the soaring grain markets supported livestock and meat futures 
on the chicago mercantile exchange said philip stanley an analyst 
in chicago with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
unseasonably warm weather lent additional support to the pork 
bellies which are sliced to make bacon and often end up in 
summertime baconlettuceandtomato sandwiches stanley said 
the blt season is probably whats got everybody pumped up 
about the bellies he said 
live cattle settled 23 cent to 72 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in june at 7215 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 08 cent to 43 cent higher with august at 7635 cents a 
pound hogs settled 40 cent to the limit 150 cents higher with 
june at 5477 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were up the 
2centsapound limit across the board with july at 5632 cents a 
pound 
the higher agricultural commodity prices often perceived as an 
inflationary signal prompted hedgetype buying of gold and silver 
futures on new yorks commodity exchange and heavy buying of 
platinum on the new york mercantile exchange analysts said 
the dollars relative weakness against foreign currencies has 
made platinum particularly attractive to japanese and european 
investors said richard maseri senior trader for jcc inc a 
miamibased commodities brokerage 
platinum settled 25 to 3370 higher with july at 61090 a 
troy ounce gold was 350 to 420 higher with june at 455 a troy 
ounce silver was 7 cents to 10 cents higher with june at 660 a 
troy ounce 
stockindex futures jumped sharply on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp 
poors 500 index settled 945 points higher at 26295 
oil prices rose in light trading on the new york mercantile 
exchange but dealers were reluctant to take new positions in 
advance of opecs june 8 meeting in vienna analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 8 
cents higher with july at 1751 a barrel heating oil was 06 cent 
to 45 cent higher with june at 4823 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 04 cent to 40 cent higher with june at 5295 cents a

stock traders celebrated their return from the 
threeday memorial holiday on tuesday with a buying spree that 
pushed the dow jones industrial average to its second biggest gain 
of the year 
analysts said there was no single piece of news to account for 
the surge which came on the heaviest daily volume since late 
january but they said the markets pessimism had grown so 
pervasive that a rebound was inevitable 
sometimes its better just to enjoy and not analyze things 
like this said john l manley jr a portfolio strategist for 
smith barney harris upham amp co its been a bad may 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 1031 points 
last friday climbed 7468 to 203112 its highest level since it 
closed at 203631 on may 4 
it was the biggest oneday advance in the markets most 
widelyfollowed index since a 7642point gain on jan 4 the first 
trading day of the year and the sixth biggest rise ever 
the gain in the dow jones industrials was so strong that a 
voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when 
the dows rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading 
but even after the socalled collar went into effect for the 
rest of the day the bluechip average extended its gain it was 
the third time the collar had gone into effect since it was adopted 
in the aftermath of the oct 19 market crash in a bid to curb 
market volatility 
gainers outpaced losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 1211 up 333 down 
and 401 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 24761 million shares 
up from 13359 million in the previous session and the highest 
since 27525 million shares were traded there on jan 25 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trading at regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market 
totaled 27155 million shares 
the pace of trading has been slow in recent weeks as traders 
weighed the implications of continuing strength in the economy 
while a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits some 
investors worried that an expanding economy could also reignite 
inflation 
while analysts were unable to pinpoint why the market surged 
tuesday they said several factors may have contributed to the big 
gain 
they cited stability in the dollar and the bond markets 
resilience in the face of a new surge in commodity futures prices 
they also cited relief that the federal reserve board had failed 
to boost its discount rate its interest charge on loans to 
financial institutions as some feared it would after the markets 
closed last week 
eldon a grimm a senior vice president at the brokerage birr 
wilson securities inc said there is an enormous amount of cash 
around out of the market due to wariness in the wake of last 
octobers crash 
but every time we get a little rally going people think they 
will miss the boat and buy something he said 
peter dapuzzo manager of retail equity trading for shearson 
lehman hutton inc said the warm weather over the holiday may have 
prompted investors to reevaluate the markets prospects and put 
some cash to work 
youve got to start a summer rally sometime and memorial day 
is usually the threshold to the summer he said 
two utility stocks that have a deadline soon for dividend 
eligibility accounted for more than a third of the trading activity

it is only coincidence that a taiwanese boeing 
737 that disintegrated and crashed in 1981 and an aloha airlines 
737 that lost part of its fuselage over hawaii in april were built 
one after the other boeing officials said tuesday 
on april 28 a 20foot section of the aloha jets forward upper 
fuselage ripped away at 24000 feet a flight attendant fell to her 
death and 61 passengers were injured but the flight crew landed 
the plane safely 
the aloha plane was the 152nd 737200 produced by boeing plane 
no 151 was a far eastern air transport jet that disintegrated and 
exploded at 22000 feet over central taiwan on aug 22 1981 
killing all 110 people on board 
the cause of the aloha accident is still under investigation 
however the federal aviation administration has ordered us 
airlines flying older 737s to reinspect the aircraft 
boeing believes the far eastern crash was caused by maintenance 
problems spokesman jack gamble of boeing commercial airplanes 
said any similarities between that crash and the aloha accident 
are a series of coincidences gamble said 
at the time of the planes manufacture in 1969 boeing was 
turning out between two and three 737s a month gamble said he 
said he knew of no other problems involving 737s made around that 
time 
in an article tuesday in the wall street journal benjamin 
cosgrove boeing commercial airplanes vice president and general 
manager for engineering also said the consecutive aircraft numbers 
were coincidence cosgrove said that while both accidents involved 
a section of the fuselage that boeing refers to as section 43 
there was nothing inherently wrong with that portion of the 
aircraft 
cosgrove told the journal the far eastern 737 repeatedly was 
used to ship fish in open containers and corrosive salt water may 
have gotten into the cargo hold the newspaper said far eastern 
officials denied that charge and said fish were shipped only in 
nonleaking containers 
national transportation safety board spokesman michael benson in 
washington dc said tuesday ntsb investigators also believe 
leaking salt water from fish shipments was the cause of the far 
eastern jets corrosion 
gamble said boeing had issued a series of service bulletins on 
older 737s including one in march 1978 recommending aircraft 
owners make additional inspections of fuselage skins for possible 
corrosion on july 1 1981 the faa issued an airworthiness 
directive requiring us carriers to inspect older 737s 
boeing had supplied kits to airlines to allow them to replace 
corroded skin on planes gamble said 
a kit was delivered to far eastern in april 1980 which means 
they had those in their spare parts inventory considerably before 
that crash but apparently was never used on the plane he said 
cosgrove was in washington dc to attend a conference on 
problems with aging aircraft and was not available for comment 
tuesday gamble said the threeday conference was called by the 
faa after the aloha incident to study safety issues involving older 
aircraft 
t craig martin director of public relations for boeing 
commercial airplanes noted the faa also issued an airworthiness 
directive following the far eastern crash requiring inspections of 
737 cargo holds 
milton goto spokesman for aloha airlines said that as a result 
of the directive aloha made extensive repairs in 1983 to the 737 
subsequently involved in the april incident he said the work done 
on the wings and lower portion of the plane might have helped it 
stay together long enough to land 
the twinengine 737 which entered service in 1968 is the 
worlds most popular commercial aircraft with more than 2000 
ordered in five different models 
one of the faa airworthiness directives issued after the aloha 
accident focuses on early models of 737s in which boeing used a 
coldbonding process in which structural parts of the fuselage 
were laminated together using an adhesive that cured at room 
temperature 
martin said he found a number of differences between the two 
accidents the far eastern plane for example was 12 years old and 
had approximately 33000 landings while the aloha jet was 20 years 
old and had about 90000 landings 
as best we know the far eastern accident was caused by 
corrosion in the planes cargo hold while the aloha accident 
involved the top of the plane he said 
but again the appropriate thing is to see what the ntsb and 
the faa conclude before drawing all these analogies and 
comparisons martin said 
martin said boeing issues service bulletins on its aircraft to 
customers whenever it learns of a problem or the potential for one 
the faa and other appropriate regulatory agencies also are 
notified he said 
he said the ntsb believes the issues presented in the far 
eastern case were known and addressed and adequately so by the 
faa airworthiness directive

tuesday that earnings rose 50 percent to a record 93 million in 
the first three months of this year 
the corporation known as freddie mac buys mortgages and

financier carl c icahn whose bid for texaco 
inc was rejected last week on tuesday charged the oil giant 
engaged in a continuing series of damaging managerial blunders 
in an amended counterclaim in response to a lawsuit filed by 
texaco icahn contends texaco deliberately concealed information 
and made false and misleading statements to its stockholders 
texaco said in a statement from its white plains ny 
headquarters that the counterclaim was utterly groundless the 
company said it would respond in detail through the normal 
litigation process 
icahn who offered to acquire texaco for 60 a share in a bid 
that values the company at 146 billion complained that the 
company did not tell shareholders it offered him greenmail which 
he has said he rejected he also charged that texaco condoned the 
misuse of corporate assets in a california real estate venture 
icahn said texaco approached him with a thirdparty buyer 
willing to pay 50 a share for his stake in the oil giant and said 
he rejected the offer because it smacked of greenmail 
in the original counterclaim icahn and his affiliates claimed 
that texaco and four directors made misleading statements in proxy 
material distributed to shareholders 
the counterclaim charges the acts are part of a management 
scheme to entrench itself to the detriment of the stockholders 
icahn has launched his own proxy fight in an attempt to win five 
seats on texacos board of directors and has extended his tender 
offer until texacos annual meeting on june 17 
texaco president and chief executive officer james kinnear who 
is cited in icahns counterclaim along with three others has been 
skeptical of icahns ability to finance the buyout 
as texacos largest shareholder icahn controls 148 percent of 
the oil giants outstanding shares

chairman david ruder ordered the agency to hire two outside 
counsel one to investigate possible disciplinary action against 
sec officials involved in the case and another to review the 
agencys equal employment procedures said spokeswoman mary mccue 
the agency meanwhile is trying to reach a settlement with 
staff attorney catherine broderick who won favorable judgment last 
month from us district judge john h pratt on her sexual 
harassment suit 
pratt found that ms broderick was forced to work in a 
sexually hostile atmosphere where male supervisors had romantic 
relationships with seceretaries who received promotions and 
bonuses 
the judge also ruled that ms broderick was passed over for 
promotions and given a negative evaluation after she complained 
emphasizing that the agency still has not decided whether to 
appeal pratts decision ms mccue said sec lawyers are negotiating 
with ms brodericks attorneys over how to resolve the case 
pratt ordered both sides to submit proposals for compensating 
ms broderick remedies which could promotions and back pay 
a hearing which was scheduled for wednesday was postponed 
until june 16 to give both sides more time to discuss a way to 
resolve the case ms mccue said 
following the ruling ruder who became chairman last year said 
he was distressed by the judges decision 
the events covered by the lawsuit occurred during the tenure of 
john sr shad ruders predecessor who is now us ambassador to 
the netherlands pratt found that shad and the agencys executive 
director george kundahl were aware of ms brodericks allegations 
in early 1984 
a 1986 investigation by the secs equal employment opportunity 
office found no nexus between ms brodericks complaint and the 
other activities that were going on in the office 
pratt concluded that two officials of the washington regional 
office in arlington va made sexually suggestive remarks to ms 
broderick 
he also concluded that the testimony of several officials was 
deserving little credence and in the case of one was was in 
material respects false and incredible

the complex procedures by which congress 
approves spending and tax plans are badly in need of reform 
including adoption of a twoyear budget cycle witnesses told a 
national commission tuesday 
the national economic commission created by congress to 
recommend ways to solve the governments budget woes heard a 
variety of recommendations ranging from decreasing the number of 
congressional committees involved in budget writing to giving the 
president authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by 
congress 
but all of the witnesses cautioned the commission against 
spending too much time looking into the budget process saying this 
was not the main flaw which has led to record federal deficits 
during the reagan years 
creation of the deficit was the result of a series of policy 
mistakes and miscalculations both economic and political that 
process changes probably would not have prevented said alice 
rivlin former head of the congressional budget office 
fixing the deficit requires having the political courage to 
face up to the problem and agree on a package of spending cuts 
andor tax increases that will correct it she said 
the 12member commission headed by washington attorney robert 
strauss and former transportation secretary drew lewis was holding 
its second public hearing with a goal of coming up with a set of 
recommendations for the new president and congress by dec 21 
the witnesses tuesday all recommended switching from the current 
annual budgets which have tied up congress in unending debate to 
a twoyear budget cycle 
a twoyear budget approved in the first year of each 
congressional term would substantially reduce the current burden of 
preparing and approving budgets in both the administration and 
congress said william niskanen former member of president 
reagans council of economic advisers 
niskanen also suggested that congress had gone too far in 
restricting presidential power when it passed the impoundment 
control act of 1974 that law prevented president nixon and his 
successors from simply refusing to spend money appropriated by 
congress any such impoundment of funds would have to be 
specifically approved by a positive vote in both the house and the 
senate 
in effect appropriations are now both a ceiling and a floor 
on spending and there is no way to run a complex organization under 
these constraints niskanen said the restrictions on 
impoundment authority should be recognized as an overreaction to 
the abuses of presidential authority during the watergate era 
stephen bell former executive director of the senate budget 
committee said he believed the government would have a 
substantially smaller deficit currently if the president still 
had authority to refuse to spend appropriated money 
bell said that any reforms should seek to make the process more 
understandable to the general public 
the present process has descended into almost a cult of 
mysteries reminiscent of the pagan cults of 2000 years ago he 
said we need to change that so that more americans can 
participate intelligently in this critical debate on fiscal policy 
and national priorities 
bell recommended combining many of the budgeting functions now 
shared by numerous congressional committees restricting the types 
of amendments that can be offered to budget bills in the senate and 
giving the president the ability to veto individual items in a 
spending bill a proposal long sought by president reagan 
ms rivlin suggested that the administration should consider 
consolidating its own budget functions now scattered between the 
office of management and budget the treasury department and the 
council of economic advisers into a single cabinet agency 
responsible to the president for overall economic policymaking 
the creaky overburdened budget process badly needs 
simplification ms rivlin said the commission could do a 
major national service by emphasizing this fact and pointing the 
parties in a constructive direction

nelson bunker hunt testified tuesday that 
inflation and world political events and not a plot by him and 
his brothers to corner the world silver market led prices to 
rocket in the late 1970s 
in his first day of testimony in a multimillion dollar civil 
trial at federal court hunt essentially repeated assertions made 
by defense lawyers in their opening statements last february 
hunt 62 his brothers william herbert hunt 58 and lamar hunt 
55 are being sued by a south american silver concern that claims 
the dallas tex brothers conspired to corner the world silver 
market between september 1979 and january 1980 
lawyers for minpeco sa a mineral marketing company owned by the 
peruvian government claim the hunts and several codefendants were 
responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about 9 an 
ounce to more than 50 an ounce 
minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused it to lose more 
than 100 million when the world silver market collapsed in march 
1980 with prices falling back to about 10 an ounce 
but the rotund elder hunt brother claimed he began investing in 
silver bullion and silver futures because of continuing inflation 
and certain political events 
hunt who said he began investing in silver in 1973 said that 
by the fall of 1979 he was still telling people that silver was 
an overall good investment 
but 1979 was a very unsettling year politically said hunt 
in a low texas drawl noting the iranian revolution that ousted the 
shah and took american diplomats hostage in teheran a continuing 
increase in oil prices the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the 
seizure of the grand mosque at mecca by islamic radicals 
hunt whose legendary father hl hunt made the family fortune 
in oil said as oil prices began climbing to about 30 a barrel 
in late 1979 he bought more and more silver 
but he claimed new commodity exchange rules limiting the number 
of futures contracts that could be held as well as increasing the 
amount to be put down on margin accounts was a difficult thing 
for the market

the talks followed a memorial day holiday weekend break during 
which both sides studied the impact of last weeks overwhelming 
ratification by the writers guild of a model contract with 73 
independent producers 
the independent contract which permits immediate employment of 
an estimated 400 writers covers such programs as the cosby 
show and the tonight show with johnny carson 
the threeyear waiver contracts grant the writers key demand 
retention of the present formula for the residual payments that
