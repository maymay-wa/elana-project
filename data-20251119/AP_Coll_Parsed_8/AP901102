the republican nominee for congress from the 
nations capital acknowledged in 1984 that he had occasionally 
smoked marijuana while in the reagan administration the washington 
post reported in saturday editions 
harry m singleton made the admission in a divorce proceeding 
saying six years ago that he had used marijuana probably five 
times in the preceeding three years 
during that time he rose from chief minority counsel of the 
house district committee to deputy assistant secretary of commerce 
and then to assistant secretary of education 
i was experimenting when i was deputy assistant secretary 
singleton said in an interview with the post i was not what you 
would call a user youre at a party and somebodys passing 
something around and you take a hit 
singleton 41 said he would not characterize his use as right 
or wrong but rather certainly something a lot of people in my 
generation did 
in a deposition in the divorce proceeding singleton said that 
while an undergraduate student at johns hopkins university i 
grew marijuana i think once or twice as an experiment in my dorm 
room 
he told the post on friday he didnt recall ever growing 
marijuana as for smoking it singleton said the point is i do 
not do that now and have not for years that was probably the last 
time i did anything like that 
possession of marijuana in the district of columbia is a 
misdemeanor 
singleton is running against democrat eleanor holmes norton to 
be dc delegate to congress 
the post said it discovered the deposition while reviewing 
singletons divorce case after a former singleton associate and an 
aide to norton suggested that the paper look more closely at his 
personal life 
the deposition came during a bitter divorce case that ended with 
singletons being awarded custody of the couples two children 
in her own deposition margot singleton then an employee of the 
department of housing and urban development alleged that she and 
singleton had used cocaine 
both in the deposition and in an interview singleton 
emphatically denied the allegations of cocaine use 
margot singleton also alleged he had beaten her on several 
occasions 
in the deposition he said there was no violence with the 
exception of one occasion when we had a knock down drag out fight 
that was the only time that we had ever come to blows

alan cranston one of five us senators with 
ties to financier charles keating jr declined an invitation to 
testify before a grand jury probing junk bond sales at a keating 
thrift transcripts unsealed friday show 
cranston is one of the keating five senators who accepted 
13 million in political contributions from the arizona developer 
the senate ethics committee is investigating whether they 
improperly intervened with regulators on keatings behalf to keep 
open his lincoln savings and loan association long after it should 
have been seized 
larry mason special counsel to the grand jury said in the 
transcripts that an invitation to testify was sent to cranston the 
democratic senators attorney replied with a letter saying cranston 
would be unable to testify 
the letter indicated that he requested the grand jury to 
withdraw their invitation to testify basically because of a busy 
schedule and he didnt feel he had anything too material to say 
said lynn miller a keating prosecutor 
cranston said he was unaware of the severity of lincolns 
problems at the time he spoke to thrift regulators he said he 
talked to the regulators merely to try to cut red tape on behalf of 
keating a substantial california employer 
the 4600page 45volume transcript unsealed at the request of 
media organizations in keatings criminal fraud case was filled 
with other allegations as well 
an 83yearold widow told the grand jury she was lured into 
plunging her savings into risky bonds sold at lincoln savings by an 
investment counselor who assured her they were safe 
adelaida whinfield said she lost 50000 on bonds purchased at a 
lincoln savings branch in hemet a desert community 100 miles east 
of los angeles mrs whinfield said an investment counselor told 
her the bonds were as safe as the united states of america 
keating and three former top officers of his companies are 
charged with misleading investors about the safety of risky junk 
bonds sold at branches of lincoln savings which later failed the 
bonds were issued by the nowdefunct parent of lincoln american 
continental corp which keating headed 
keating and the others are charged with ordering employees to 
steer lincoln depositors away from insured certificates of deposit 
and into the bonds 
many other buyers were elderly and lost their life savings all 
told 17458 investors lost more than 250 million prosecutors 
said the indictment listed only 20 victims who lost 11 million 
prosecutors said they wanted a clear concise case to present to 
the jury 
grand jurors heard from many investors who said they had been 
deceived about the bonds safety the transcript was unsealed by 
superior court judge lance ito at the request of news 
organizations 
rose brine 63 a housewife from suburban lakewood said a 
teller instructed her to talk to a bond salesman when she came in 
to renew her certificate of deposit which carried a low interest 
rate 
mrs brine said she was told the bonds carried higher rates as 
high as 9 percent but was never told they were uninsured she said 
she first invested 10000 then put in another 50000 her life 
savings 
that was it the whole thing mrs brine said 
meanwhile the resolution trust corp announced friday it is 
putting up for sale 18 failed savings institutions including 
lincoln savings which is considered to be the costliest collapsed 
thrift ever 
the failure of lincoln could cost taxpayers an estimated 2 
billion

a national ku klux klan leader said friday 
that democratic senate candidate harvey gantt was another crooked 
black politician whose victory over jesse helms would help boost 
the groups membership 
imperial wizard jw farrands told the associated press in a 
telephone interview that gantt should be elected so they can see 
what a black politician can do 
farrands who heads the invisible empire of the knights of the 
ku klux klan one of numerous klan groups was asked to explain his 
groups announcement of its endorsement of gantts candidacy 
if they elect him theyll find out weve got another crooked 
black politician farrands said hell tax everybody equally as 
long as theyre workng people and give all their money to the poor 
and downtrodden 
god help the state of north carolina he said thats what 
they need 
gantt did not return numerous telephone calls the ap made friday 
to his charlotte campaign office campaign officials would not 
comment on farrands statements the election is tuesday 
helms the incumbent conservative republican was en route to a 
rally late friday and could not immediately be reached for comment 
gantt who was the first black mayor of charlotte has accused 
helms of trying to make race an issue in the campaign through 
television advertisements that discuss hiring quotas for 
minorities 
helms has defended the spots as raising legitimate issues about 
hiring quotas and gantts background 
a charlotte observerwscctv poll broadcast friday said gantt 
led helms by 6 percentage points of 703 likely voters surveyed 47 
percent said they favored gantt while 41 percent supported helms 
twelve percent were undecided 
the margin of error was 37 percent 
farrands comments came three days after a state leader of his 
klan group released a letter announcing its endorsement of 
gantt 
we envision him as being the catalyst to a powerful resurgence 
of our hooded order in the tarheel state robert bost the 
groups grand dragon in north carolina wrote in a letter sent to 
several news organizations may he fulfill that role 
admirably 
when gantt heard about the letter earlier this week he declined 
to directly address the socalled endorsement 
i heard rumors to that effect gantt told reporters at the 
time i dont really think i have a comment there have been some 
tricks in this campaign and this may be one of them 
earlier friday gantt vowed to stay on the high road in the 
campaigns final days 
ive tried to be consistent and stay on that high road all the 
way through gantt said were going to try to prove once and 
for all that you can win in north carolina running against jesse 
helms running a clean positive issueoriented campaign 
he said that relaxed ussoviet relations offered an 
opportunity to cut the federal deficit and called for a lean and 
mean and technologically superior defense posture 
he also said the federal government should be an aggressive 
partner in education protecting the environment and encouraging 
a national energy policy he added money also needs to be spent to 
improve health care address the crime and drug problems and reduce 
poverty he said 
the woman who beat gantt in the charlottes 1987 mayoral race 
sue myrick campaigned for helms and said gantt wanted to increase 
social welfare programs

a federal appeals court upheld a ruling 
friday that the los angeles county supervisors discriminated 
against hispanics when they redrew district lines 
the court ordered an election in a new district with a hispanic 
majority 
by a 21 vote the 9th us circuit court of appeals approved a 
plan by us district judge david kenyon who had found intentional 
manipulation of election boundaries by supervisors in 1981 to 
dilute the voting strength of hispanics 
the court rejected the countys argument that no new lines 
should be drawn until after the 1990 census 
the countys population of 87 million is about 35 percent 
hispanic no hispanic has been elected to the fivemember board of 
supervisors in its 115year history 
the court said kenyon should schedule an election as soon as 
possible in the new district to succeed retiring supervisor pete 
schabarum 
because of the time needed for computer preparation the primary 
election is likely to occur in february or march said ramona 
ripston executive director of the american civil liberties union 
of southern california which represented hispanic plaintiffs in 
the case 
its a complete victory she said weve maintained all 
along that the county board of supervisors discriminated against 
hispanics only white males have been elected to that governing 
body since its inception this is a great day for minorities and 
women it means the government belongs to all of us

a week of roundtheclock sitins at 
smith college ended friday when administrators and students 
tentatively agreed to set up a center for minority and foreign 
students 
up to 60 students had camped out in the halls of smiths main 
administration building since oct 26 to demand creation of a 
multicultural center numerous marches were held at the private 
womens college during the week 
thursday night the leaders tentatively accepted the 
administrations offer to temporarily base the center at hampshire 
house a center for commuter students the rest of the students 
tentatively approved the offer friday and called off the protest 
under the agreement leaders of the campus various cultural 
groups will form a task force to work with administrators to find a 
permanent home for the center 
the agreement was not to be formalized until monday when 
administrators said they would know if the hampshire house would be 
available officials were to spend the weekend searching for a new 
home for the commuter center 
about 17 percent of smiths 2600 students are nonwhite 
most of us are just so happy its over because were so 
tired said vivian chiang leader of the asian students 
association the group was one of seven involved in the protest 
were thrilled that weve reached an agreement said school 
spokeswoman debra bradley it has been an exhausting process

scientists have for the first time 
genetically engineered the parts of plant cells where 
photosynthesis occurs 
rutgers university researchers said they have introduced 
genetically altered material into the chloroplasts of a tobacco 
plant whose seeds produced plants that carried the same traits 
photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts the tiny structures in 
plant cells that contain chlorophyll photosynthesis is the 
fundamental process by which plants make food and capture the suns 
energy 
we now have this tool to genetically improve photosynthesis 
to make it more efficient said pal maliga the director of 
rutgers research team 
improved photosynthesis could eventually make for bigger and 
sturdier plants that could more efficiently produce food in a 
shorter amount of time maliga said 
scientists in other parts of the country hailed the rutgers 
finding as a breakthrough 
it certainly is a first in higher plants said milton 
zaitlin the director of the biotechnology program at cornell 
university in ithaca ny 
its a major breakthrough said richard hallick a 
biochemist at the university of arizona its something that has 
been sought for at least a decade 
the results of the experiment were reported thursday in the 
proceedings of the national academy of sciences a scientific 
journal 
photosynthesis is fundamental to all plant and animal life 
because it provides the carbohydrates to power their metabolic 
processes 
in photosynthesis green plants use sunlight to make 
carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in the presence of 
chlorophyll 
all fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas originally 
captured their energy from the sun through photosynthesis 
one of the first commercial spinoffs could be to engineer plants 
resistant to herbicides said randall hauptmann director of the 
plant and molecular biology center at northern illinois university 
in dekalb 
many herbicides work through the photosynthetic process to kill 
weeds farmers could apply herbicide to kill weeds while not 
hurting the resistant crops he said 
in the long term scientists could use the findings to explore 
ways of developing plants resistant to drought or low temperatures 
maliga said 
we want crop plants to perform to serve human needs which 
wasnt the object of evolution maliga said 
three compartments in plant cells contain genes the nucleus 
chloroplasts and mitochondria 
scientists have introduced altered genes into the nucleus and 
most biotechnological innovation to date comes from this method of 
transformation 
researchers have also introduced genetically altered material 
into the chloroplasts of algae but never before into the 
chloroplasts of higher plants or into mitochondria 
maliga and two other scientists zora svab and peter 
hajdukiewitz worked on the twoyear project under a grant from 
the new jersey science initiative 
the team coated microscopic tungsten particles with an altered 
chloroplast gene from a tobacco plant using a particle 
bombardment process the team used a special gun to spray the 
cells with the tiny pellets 
the scientists then used the cells to raise plants that were 
genetically stable the new plants produced seeds that contained 
the altered genes 
we can do it on a regular basis but it is inefficient 
maliga said we want to make ita tool available to all plant 
scientists 
tobacco was used because tobacco is one of the few plants whose 
cell culture is wellknown maliga said 
rutgers university has filed a patent on the process maliga 
said

the agriculture departments latest monthly 
indicators of prices paid and received by farmers shows a classic 
pattern of costprice squeeze 
in july the index of prices farmers receive for what they 
producrs had the same buying power they had in 191014 
for example the average price of corn in october was reported 
at 215 per bushel only 38 percent of the theoretical price of 
full parity 567 per bushel 
overall the report showed commodity prices averaged 52 percent 
of parity in october the lowest reading since april 1988 and one 
of the lowest since the early years of the great depression in the 
1930s 
although some usda records are contradictory the alltime low 
mark in the parity ratio was around 49 percent in june 1932 it 
hovered near that five years ago at 50 percent for several months 
many economists including some in usda itself say the old 
parity concept is outmoded and doesnt reflect todays agricultural 
finance sector including efficiencies of production and net 
income 
its defenders say parity still is important in showing a 
relationship between prices and costs trends and changes from one 
year to another 
 
washington ap the us rice stockpile will remain tight in 
the 199091 marketing year despite loss of the iraqi market 
according to an agriculture department report 
rice output in 1990 is expected to fall short of use for the 
fifth straight year the departments economic research service 
said 
but rice imports mostly from thailand probably will keep 
reserve inventories from falling by the end of the marketing year 
next aug 1 the report said 
rice imports in calendar 1989 totaled about 27 million 
hundredweight with nearly 24 million coming from thailand 
total us rice production this year is forecast at 1581 
million hundredweight up 23 percent from 1989 exports are 
projected to fall 36 percent to 74 million hundredweight 
analysts attributed the export decline to reduced world trade 
and the united nations general embargo against iraq 
exporters are searching for new markets to replace the 
substantial loss of the iraqi market the report said eastern 
europe africa and latin america were said to be areas where us 
rice exports are likely to increase 
the us rice carryover next aug 1 is projected at 263 million

it was a halloween trick all right but was the 
sight of five naked men dancing onstage with rocker billy idol a 
treat 
idol told the crowd of 14000 at seattle coliseum he knew 
something would happen because wednesday was the last night of the 
tour the night band members traditionally play pranks on each 
other 
not to mention that idol had already had 600 dead fish dumped on 
faith no more as they opened the show in a soggy smelly gag 
spoofing one of the bands video that shows a fish flopping on the 
ground 
when the payback came idol grinned widely as the naked men 
cavorted onstage in a conga line wearing only masks or tshirts 
over their heads 
idol kept plugging away at his final song got to be a 
over until the bare band danced off then blushed a little and 
broke out laughing 
police were called in but by the time they arrived the 
musicians had left the coliseum and no one could prove who had 
pulled the prank idols publicist rick scott said

an official commission is calling for a quicker 
nofault divorce law saying whats now on the books forces couples 
to separate or recriminate and makes children suffer 
unnecessarily 
the need to allege fault in order to obtain a quick divorce 
does nothing to help the marriage but can easily raise the 
temperature of the proceedings often to the detriment of the 
children the law commission said in its report released 
thursday 
the current law does nothing to support those marriages which 
can and should be saved nor does it allow marriages which are dead 
to be decently buried the commission said 
couples currently may divorce within six months usually on 
grounds of adultery or unreasonable behavior the panel proposed 
permitting nofault divorce that can be obtained in one year and 
dropping the required twoyear separation 
the body also proposed scrapping the 5year separation and 
annulment necessary when one party opposes divorce 
the commissions proposals were immediately hailed by lawyers 
marriage counseling organizations and family groups 
one in three british marriages ends in divorce one of the 
highest rates in europe according to the marriage guidance 
service relate 
zelda westmeads a spokeswoman for relate said we like the 
proposals because the needs of children are put first 
the commission proposes that a couple should be allowed to seek 
a divorce without assessing blame after they have spent a year 
considering and reflecting on whether their marriage can be 
saved 
lord mackay who as lord chancellor is britains chief legal 
officer said the proposals will force people to look at the 
consequences of the divorce for themselves and their children in 
the hope that they may turn back from breaking up the marriage 
sue slipman director of the national council for one parent 
families said the proposals would allow divorces to be conducted 
in a less heated manner 
divorce will not be made easier but the new proposals should 
allow greater opportunity to find agreement and consensus she 
said 
the law commission comprised of senior lawyers was set up by 
parliament in 1965 to make proposals to the government for revising 
outdated obscure or otherwise unsatisfactory laws 
to change the divorce law the government would have to 
introduce a bill in parliament law commission recommendations 
carry significant weight but the government is not bound to follow 
them

for the first time in 15 years of 
devastating civil war the bombshattered st georges hotel served 
as a backdrop for a fashion show with moslem and christian models 
this is the message we hope to carry to the people of our 
country the phoenix rising from the ashes said fashion designer 
loulwa abdelbaki the creator of thursdays 30minute program 
ms abdelbaki a member of the druse moslem sect and 20 models 
worked 20 days to clear the debris from the lobby of the 
oncemajestic beachside hotel for the exhibit but left just 
enough to remind people of what happened she said 
the show called kalabsha arabic for handcuffs was intended to 
boost the latest government efforts to dismantle beiruts dividing 
green line and reunite the capital abdelbaki said 
the government began effacing the divider that split the city 
into moslem and christian halves after syrian troops backing 
president elias hrawi crushed rebel christian gen michel aoun on 
oct 13 to end an 11month mutiny against the government 
hrawi is struggling to unite the city securing the promise of 
the main christian and moslem militias to leave beirut and help 
create a militaryfree zone 
about 650 people mostly women turned out for the show 
applauding the models as they paraded on a makeshift stage under 
the wrecked lobby ceiling displaying abdelbakis fall and winter 
collection 
many were apprehensive that the loud music played during the 
exhibition would send loose debris crashing down from the ceiling 
but it held 
its like a beginning of a new life a transition from a 
horrendous past to a future with a slight glimmer of hope said 
christian actor alec khalaf 
he drove from christian east beirut to the moslem sector where 
the st georges is located for the first time in 15 years a 
feat i never thought i would accomplish in my lifetime said 
khalaf 50 
abdelbaki 26 is a graduate of the parsons school of design in 
new york 
my clothes are designed for teenagers simple neat and 
elegant i will always design for them she said 
her models with sultry looks paraded darkcolored miniskirts 
topped with long jackets or brocade vests and dresses studded with 
rocksize rhinestones 
it doesnt matter what these ladies are wearing let them wear 
cabbage and youll still be impressed by the event said helene 
badaro whose wedding party was held at the st georges 20 years 
ago 
what matters is the idea behind this fashion show the place 
and its background the efforts of these young people and their 
good intentions towards their country said mrs badaro a 
christian 
the st georges a sixstory hotel on the meditteranean had 
gained international fame when it was the favorite locale of 
lebanons government officials legislators diplomats and foreign 
correspondents before the civil war broke out in 1975 
after the first 19month round of sectarian conflict was brought 
to a halt by syrias military intervention in 1976 the st georges 
and a cluster of nearby hotels had been devastated 
rival militiamen had fought with hand grenades and machine guns 
from room to room in the st georges the 14story phoencia inter 
continental and the 25floor holiday inn 
their reconstruction would take big chunk of the 9 billion 
needed to rebuild beirut government officials say

an average life span of 85 years is the best 
that humans can hope for even if medical science defeats all of 
the major killer diseases researchers say in a study published 
today 
university of chicago researcher s jay olshansky said the upper 
limit of human life expectancy is set because uncontrollable 
effects of aging set in causing a slow decline that slides 
irreversibly into death 
medicine now stands helpless before this apparent design of 
nature he said 
in a study published today in the journal science olshansky and 
two coauthors wrote that even if cures were found for most of the 
fatal diseases the natural degeneration of the body puts a cap 
of about 85 years on the average age of death 
the conclusion differs from many other studies and some experts 
on human aging disagree strongly 
if we keep making progress as we have made in the past then a 
baby born today can expect to live 100 years said james vaupel 
of the university of minnesota there may well be some biological 
barriers but we are spending a lot of money on biomedical research 
and the sciences are poised to make some really significant 
breakthroughs 
olshansky said most of the major advances in life expectancy 
have already been achieved through improvements in public health 
nutrition immunization and advanced medical care the average life 
span in the united states went from 47 years in 1900 to 75 years 
today 
this trend is not likely to continue olshansky said the 
easy advances have already been made 
death rates for the young and those under age 50 are now so low 
that even if all dying in that age group were eliminated the life 
expectancy at birth would increase by only 35 years said 
olshansky the major killers heart disease cancer stroke and 
diabetes usually strike after the age of 50 
in order to increase the average life expectancy of the 
population to just 85 years we would have to achieve the 
equivalent of the elimination of all deaths from heart disease and 
cancer olshansky said there are very few people around who 
argue that is realistically possible 
but even controlling the major killer diseases would have little 
statistical effect on the average life span he said 
just because we eliminate major fatal disease does not mean 
that we will not grow older and die it just means that we will 
grow older and die of other diseases he said 
once you go beyond the age of 85 people die from multiple 
organ failure old age basically and there is no cure for that 
olshansky said we dont know why we age but it happens it 
affects everyone no matter what you do in terms of eliminating 
these diseases its still going to happen 
vaupel said he believes the olshansky study is too pessimistic 
we are beginning to gain a fundamental understanding of aging 
and we eventually may be able to slow down that process he said 
in a telephone interview i dont see any evidence at all that 
there is a cap at 85 
vaupel said women in some populations already are approaching 
life expectancies of 85 in okinawa the average life span of women 
now is 83 and the life expectancy of women in some mormon groups 
is almost 85 now he said this was accomplished without major 
medical intervention he said 
another researcher ken manton of duke university said the 
olshansky study is seriously flawed because it fails to take 
into account recent research that could push life expectancy rates 
upward 
manton said for example that medicine is now identifying 
specific disorders of aging such as alzheimers disease and is 
beginning to search for cures such work is almost certain to 
enable people to live longer he said 
most experts agree that research should emphasize not just 
extending life but how to make later years more free of disease 
the prospect now is that those added years will be crippling 
years olshansky said it is possible to alter that course of 
life by going after those crippling diseases thats what we should 
be doing 
olshansky said about 2 million americans are over age 85 most 
of whom require close attendance and care if us life expectancy 
rises to an average of 85 he said then there will be about 16 
million people over that age 
olshanskys coauthors were bruce a carnes of the argonne 
national laboratory in illinois and christine cassel of the 
university of chicago

researchers experimenting with laboratory 
rabbits have proved that gene manipulation can be used to correct 
an inherited disorder that causes high cholesterol levels and early 
heart attacks 
in a study published thursday in the proceedings of the national 
academy of sciences researchers reported they were able to 
transfer into rabbit liver cells a gene that temporarily corrected 
a genetic defect in the liver called familial hypercholesterolimia 
this disorder is caused by an abnormal gene that prevents the 
liver from processing low density lipoprotein cholesterol the 
socalled bad cholesterol a build up of ldl cholesterol in the 
blood leads to clogged arteries heart attack and stroke 
a severe form of the disorder caused by inheriting two abnormal 
genes strikes about one in every 1 million americans and can lead 
to heart attacks as young as age five a singlegene form of the 
disorder strikes about one in every 500 americans but produces a 
milder disease about half of the men with the mild disorder die of 
heart attack by age 60 
dr james wilson assistant professor of internal medicine at 
the university of michigan said that he and his coinvestigators 
used watanabe rabbits a laboratory animal that inherits familial 
hypercholesterolimia to attempt to correct the disorder through 
genetic engineering 
wilson said his group removed cells from the liver of affected 
rabbits and exposed the cells to a retrovirus that carried a 
correct copy of the ldl gene the virus transferred the gene into 
the cells which were then transplanted into other watanabe rabbits 
within three days said wilson the cholesterol levels of the 
treated rabbits dropped to near normal 
these rabbits can have levels of up to 700 milligrams per 
decaliter of total cholesterol said wilson a level of 200 or 
more in humans is considered a health problem 
wilson said the transferred genes corrected the rabbits 
cholesterol defect for only two weeks after that he said it 
appears that the transplanted cells were killed by the rabbit 
immune system when the cells died so did the transferred genes 
the next experiment is to remove liver cells from watanabe 
rabbits insert the missing gene and then return the cells to the 
same rabbits this would avoid the rejection problem wilson said 
that technically is more difficult he said it was easier 
to test the concept by removing the cells from one rabbit and then 
transplanting the cells into another rabbit 
wilson said the technique may eventually be applied to humans 
who lack the correct ldl gene but that it will take years of 
laboratory tests in rabbits and perhaps in monkeys and baboons 
before clinical trials could be held 
working with wilson on the study were researchers at the albert 
einstein college of medicine in new york and the whitehead 
institute in cambridge mass

northwest loggers are adopting a new strategy 
in their battle with protectors of the northern spotted owl if 
you cant beat em join em 
the washington contract loggers association has asked the us 
fish and wildlife service to declare its 600 members an endangered 
species 
its a type of manbitesdog story or man bites owl group 
leader bill pickell told reporters at the national press club on 
thursday this is serious 
the us fish and wildlife service declared the owl to be a 
threatened species under the endangered species act in june 
meaning it now is illegal to kill the rare bird or destroy its 
critical habitat 
as a result the government predicts timber harvests in the 
regions oldgrowth forests will fall as much as 50 percent by the 
end of the decade at a cost of 20000 timber jobs 
the loggers filed their own petition with the service on oct 
15 asking that they be declared an endangered species worthy of 
the same kind of protection under the 17yearold law 
our belief is the language is broad enough to allow the 
listing of a population of human beings said mark rutzick an 
attorney for the group there is no language in the endangered 
species act to exclude humans 
pickell said the message was well received thursday during a 
meeting with members of president bushs white house domestic 
policy staff he said interior deputy assistant secretary john 
schrote assured him the request would be considered seriously 
we are here to bring public awareness to the destructiveness 
of the endangered species act on the people of the northwest 
through the listing of the spotted owl as a threatened species 
pickell said 
otherwise there might not be any loggers on the olympic 
peninsula they may become fastfood workers in southern california 
or autoworkers in detroit he said 
the idea of listing humans as endangered has been tried before 
the samish indian tribe sought such protection in 1987 when it 
became frustrated in attempts to gain federal recognition as a 
tribe 
the fish and wildlife service denied that petition saying that 
humans do not qualify for listing under the endangered species act 
because they do not constitute a wild animal

australia and new zealand will send 
military tracking aircraft on flights over the south pacific to 
spot fishing boats using socalled wall of death driftnet 
techniques the government said today 
prime minister bob hawke said the flights of lockheed orions by 
both air forces will coincide with the fishing season from dec 1 
to march 
it was in response to this pressure earlier this year that 
japan suspended driftnet fishing operations in the south pacific 
hawke said taiwan has also reduced its fleet numbers but has 
indicated that it will continue some driftnet fishing this 
season 
driftnets hang more than 30 feet below the surface and stretch 
as far as 35 miles critics say they indiscriminately trap and kill 
fish thousands of marine mammals and 800000 birds a year

democrats are threatening to take republicans 
to court over schemes they say are meant to intimidate minority 
voters in north carolina texas and possibly elsewhere 
but the republican national committee countered that the threat 
is a scheme to drum up minority turnout on election day 
this unsupportable scare tactic by the democrats is nothing 
more than part of their annual getoutthe vote plan said rnc 
spokeswoman leslie goodman 
the north carolina senate and texas governor contests are so 
tight that democrats are counting on minority turnout to put them 
over the top 
democratic party strategists said thursday they were trying to 
publicize the gop mailings in order to counter the fear they may 
induce among voters they acknowledged it was possible that a 
backlash could drive up minority turnout 
the democratic officials requested an immediate justice 
department investigation into gop ballot security programs and 
said they were contacting the court that issued a 1982 consent 
decree banning such tactics 
we will move quickly on this were not about to abide it 
said paul tully political director of the democratic national 
committee we keep fighting this same stupid battle its enough 
already 
he and others said local and state republican organizations were 
sending postcards with misleading or false information to heavily 
black sections of north carolina and east texas 
party chairman ron brown said the gop has used similar tactics 
through the past decade despite agreeing in 1982 and 1986 not to do 
so 
he told attorney general dick thornburgh in a handdelivered 
letter that activity in north carolina and texas may be just the 
tip of the iceberg and asked for a quick examination of possible 
civil rights violations 
brown also reminded all 50 state republican chairmen in a letter 
that the 1982 consent decree bars ballot intimidation and ballot 
security activities he noted that the orange county calif 
republican party last year paid a 400000 settlement after being 
sued for intimidating hispanic voters in 1988 
goodman said the rnc has nothing to do with the ballot 
security program in north carolina texas or anywhere else 
rick shelby political director of the national republican 
senatorial committee called the flap much ado about nothing 
he said ballot security is a standard operating procedure in many 
campaigns and is just getting more publicity in north carolina than 
elsewhere 
its merely an effort to ensure that its a fair honest 
election shelby said 
among the evidence the democrats presented thursday 
a copy of the postcard mailed to voters in heavily black north 
carolina precincts saying people must contact the board of 
elections if they recently moved and must have lived in a precinct 
for the last 30 days or they cant vote brown said the postcards 
contained fraudulent information in fact the democrats say 
voters who have moved may either go to the board of elections 
before they vote or to the precinct in which they are registered on 
election day and get transferred to the precinct where they now 
live 
copies of postcards sent to elderly texans in gregg county who 
had requested absentee ballots the cards urged them to throw that 
mail ballot in the trash and walk proudly into the voting place 
in honor of the many who fought and died for your right to walk 
into the polls 
brown said that in texas once someone requests an absentee 
ballot they cannot vote in person without going through a 
complicated procedure to cancel the absentee ballot 
a copy of a helms fundraising letter seeking money to conduct 
ballot security activities and a copy of a gop campaign finance 
reform proposal that listed ballot security as a partybuilding 
activity eligible for federal funds the may 1990 proposal did not 
become law

republicans are worried that a turnedoff 
electorate will stay home next tuesday and spell disaster for many 
gop candidates 
a low turnout doesnt help us said edward j rollins 
cochairman of the national republican campaign committee 
rollins assessment was echoed by norman cummings political 
director of the republican national committee who said those 
marginal voters are republicanleaning voters in many key states 
curtis gans director of the committee for the study of the 
american electorate said the outlook for voter turnout is a more 
iffy situation this year than in most midterm elections but he 
predicted that turnout on tuesday would be about the same as four 
years ago 
in the 1986 midterm election 364 percent of eligible voters 
went to the polls the lowest turnout since 1942 
gans said there has been a slight increase in republican voter 
registration but it might not translate into a larger republican 
vote 
my own guess is that overall because of taxes and an 
incipient recession therell be a decline of slight proportions 
despite the increase in registration in the republican vote 
nationally he said 
you could have a phenomena in a number of places the sort of 
lower middle class urban ethnic whos been sort of a swing vote in 
recent elections coming back to the democratic party gans said 
thats what happened in the recession of 1982 it might happen 
with the fear of a recession plus the fairness issue this year 
a consistent theme in democratic campaigns around the country 
has been to portray their candidates as advocates of economic 
fairness for all americans and republicans as protectors of the 
rich 
rollins noted that younger voters are the most antitax group in 
the population and that a majority of republicans today are under 
40 while a majority of democrats are over 40 
those demographics bring together two factors that could give an 
edge to democrats on election day 
the antitax voters were the ones turned off when president bush 
abandoned his hardline opposition to any tax increases older 
americans have the highest percentage of voter turnout 
republicans hope that in the final days before the election 
bush will succeed in firing up republican voters and inspiring them 
to go to the polls on tuesday 
in the last days of any midterm election thats the benefit 
of a president said rollins if he can convince enough 
republicans to turn out and vote then it benefits 
bush plans to campaign nonstop before winding up tuesday in 
houston where he maintains his voting residence 
in a report on voter registration gans said that national 
registration should total about 1226 million an increase of 
nearly 3 million over 1986 but one that did not keep pace with the 
population growth 
nine states and the district of columbia reported increases in 
registered voters they were alaska arizona colorado louisiana 
massachusetts nevada north carolina texas and wyoming 
all of this points to a generally low turnout election with 
spotty surges in individual states with either hotly contested or 
races of state andor national significance said gans

united airlines is disputing us safety 
investigators finding that it should have detected the tiny flaw 
in a critical engine part that disintegrated causing the 1989 iowa 
crash that killed 112 people 
the national transportation safety board said thursday the 
probable cause of the crash of united flight 232 at sioux city 
iowa was human factors limitations in uniteds inspection and 
quality control procedures the board issued the finding without 
dissent 
board members said that because none of hundreds of similar 
tests conducted over many years on similar parts had ever found a 
defect laxity on the part of inspectors was to be expected 
reporting on a yearlong investigation the safety board said 
uniteds inspectors missed a fatigue crack in a critical area of a 
titanium fan disk in the tail engine of the dc10 aircraft 
the plane en route from denver to chicago crashed 40 minutes 
after metal from its exploding tail engine shredded the hydraulic 
system used to control flight operations 
but united officials who attended the hearing said blame should 
have been placed on general electric aircraft engines which 
manufactured the part at its evendale ohio plant in 1971 
united officials rejected the boards conclusion saying there 
is no evidence that a halfinch crack in the bore area of the fan 
disk could have been detected when the part was last inspected in 
april 1988 
ge gave us a bum part said bob doll uniteds vice 
president for engineering and quality assurance 
doll said the safety boards staff did not understand the 
airlines statements on its inspection system or the zeal with 
which he said inspectors look for defects 
stephen m wolf the airlines chairman and president said in a 
statement united which has complied fully with this 
investigation vigorously disputes the ntsbs finding as it 
pertains to our maintenance procedures 
uniteds rigorous maintenance procedures were in full 
compliance with all federal regulations and all mandated 
manufacturers requirements wolf said 
after metal from the disintegrating tail engine on the dc10 
disabled all three hydraulic systems the threeman flight crew 
joined by another united pilot who was a passenger on the flight 
alternated the thrust of the remaining two engines to partially 
control the aircraft and guide it to the airport at sioux city 
the plane crashed when they attempted to land killing 112 
people but 184 passengers and crew members survived a fact some 
board members attributed to the skill and exquisite teamwork on 
the part of the pilots 
the safety board concluded that a flaw in the fan disk which 
later caused a halfinch long crack in a vital area of the engine 
part was formed during manufacture of the titanium ingot from 
which the disk was forged 
it said the crack could have been detected in the disks most 
recent inspection by united 
james wildey a metallurgist who assisted in the investigation 
called the flaw a buried defect and added that defect has 
been in there since day one 
there is no way to introduce this kind of defect through 
operaions or anything else he said 
merritt birky a chemical research investigator said united 
should have found the crack with normal inspection procedures he 
noted that fluorescent chemicals used to detect flaws during 
inspections of engine parts were found on the failed disk and that 
they should have warned of a defect 
the safety board investigates all major transportation accidents 
in the united states it has no actual enforcement powers but can 
only investigate issue conclusions and make recommendations for 
safety improvements

iraqis feeling the squeeze from the un 
embargo are changing their eating habits lifestyle and even 
rediscovering herbal medicine 
three months after iraq invaded kuwait and the united nations 
retaliated with the trade cutoff baghdad is beginning to feel its 
isolation the pains although minor are adding up 
you want to know if the embargo is effective yes it is 
effective information minister latif jassim told reporters 
you know we want to build our country but we cannot buy we 
cannot sell anymore 
faulty traffic lights in baghdad cant be repaired because of a 
lack of spare parts many taxis and cars have broken windscreens 
that cant be replaced 
tv announcers tell iraqis not to waste food or overeat 
the lines at bread stores and governmentrun shops selling 
rationed food are becoming longer every day 
restaurants are closing down because they are no longer 
profitable at those that remain open food portions have been 
reduced a chicken leg now is served as two portions 
yes an average iraqi has started feeling the impact of the 
embargo but only at a pinch not serious biting an asian 
diplomat said still he says many industries short on materials 
have been forced to lay off workers 
merchants admit that prices have risen five to six times since 
the embargo and the government has listed 12 lifesaving 
antibiotics that can be obtained only in staterun hospitals 
we are telling our people to look at our history and realize 
that we have successfully solved several problems like this said 
ihsan alrawi managing director of the governmentrun herbal 
medicine section 
we are encouraging people to use herbal medicine more and 
more this is in many ways better than the western medicine said 
alrawi whose center displays 65 types of herbal medicines 
western and asian diplomats in baghdad agree it will take at 
least three to four months for the embargo to have any serious 
impact 
prior to the un sanctions iraq relied heavily on food imports 
that cost an average 3 billion a year the united states sold iraq 
food valued at more than 1 billion a year mostly wheat rice 
corn vegetable oil livestock and dairy products 
to fight the embargo we are trying to change our food habits 
said an iraqi restaurant owner who spoke on condition of anonymity 
before we were eating rice both for lunch and dinner now only 
once for lunch 
said another iraqi our friday breakfast which used to be all 
fun is not fun anymore 
iraqis love to eat kabd or liver curry with bread milk cream 
and cheese as their friday breakfast 
we cant manage it anymore now breakfast is just bread and 
once in a while an egg said the man who also spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
however there are signs that fresh and dried fruit have started 
arriving from iran once iraqs fiercest foe iranian apples are in 
great demand in baghdads market 
iraqi traders regularly visit kuwait with bags full of dinars 
and come back with everything from cartons of marlboro cigarettes 
to washing machines 
a pack of marlboros costs 18 on the official exchange rate 
thats also the price of 22 pounds of beef 
the monthly average salary is 500 on the official exchange 
rate 
since august the agriculture cooperative bank has provided 
credits worth about 30 million to farmers cultivating wheat 
barley and what iraqis call other strategic crops meaning 
basic food items 
beer production has been curtailed so that barley used in 
brewing can be used as staple food 
the government has started 1078 livestock farms to feed its 18 
million people and staterun television regularly shows programs 
on how to increase agricultural production landowners have been 
told they run the risk of losing their land if they dont cultivate 
it 
where the embargo is hurting most is on iraqi industry 
in a secretive country like iraq it is near impossible to find 
out how seriously affected the industrial sector is the asian 
diplomat said 
but the diplomat who has some access to information said many 
cement tire fertilizer and cigarette factories have either closed 
down or work much below capacity 
a car tire now costs from 300 to 400 in baghdad 
it is hard to detect whether iraqis blamed their government for 
the growing economic hardship the staterun media regularly blames 
the united states for all problems 
it is satan america which is to be blamed no one else is 
the common view

when 19yearold carlos guity sprints out under 
the big top of the big apple circus and executes a series of double 
back somersaults and flips each night he is fulfilling a dream 
from his south bronx childhood 
as one of only two black members of a troupe comprised of 
generations of circus performers the acrobat and tumbler sees 
himself as a symbol for those from roughandtumble neighborhoods 
who beat the odds 
a lot of people dont realize theres a lot of talent in these 
neighborhoods not just crimes or drugs he said thursday 
one of hundreds of innercity youths recruited by a big apple 
training program that began in 1979 guity stuck with it for 11 
years now hes the first circus school graduate to be hired as a 
regular performer for big apple 
seeing friends from the neighborhood destroyed by drugs only 
fueled guitys desire to succeed 
you see people youve known through the years get hooked on 
crack and you see them falling apart he said for me watching 
them gave me more motivation to stick with this and set goals 
guity also found something special in the circus that made him 
succeed where others failed 
i liked it more than the other kids he recalled i saw 
something special in it i liked the idea of going to the circus 
and seeing something that looks impossible but knowing that if 
you keep working at it you can do it 
guity who joined the circus school at age 8 spent six years 
perfecting the double back flip his most difficult move 
any normal kid would probably say i dont want to do this 
anymore he said but i think the best things come to people 
who wait 
his career suffered a setback four years ago when big apple 
acrobat and aerialist phil beder fell while performing on a 
rotating ladder and became a quadriplegic 
i owe everything to him said guity he motivated me 
physically and emotionally to this day 
guity who has avoided serious injury says he will stick with 
ground performances and isnt interested in aerial work 
he is interested in accounting though and is studying at 
lehman college in the bronx where he is a sophomore when its 
time to retire from tumbling hed like to stay with the circus as 
an accountant he already works parttime in that capacity for big 
apples corporate offices 
now with the circus about to leave new york on tour guity is 
torn between staying in school or going along 
he says he doesnt want to neglect his studies but the more he 
performs with the circus the more he likes it 
theyre very friendly here he said the circus is one 
place where its like a family theres no discrimination everyone 
just wants to work together to put on a good show

an arizona law passed in reaction to the 
impeachment and ouster of gov evan mecham could trigger a runoff 
election for governor if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote 
tuesday 
if tuesdays election is close between democrat terry goddard 
and republican fife symington writein candidate max hawkins a 
former mecham confidante and aide could garner just enough to 
force such a vote 
goddard leads symington 44 to 38 percent according to the 
latest polling with hawkins getting 4 percent of the vote 
arizona is the only state in the country with a postgeneral 
election runoff said karen osborne assistant secretary of state 
max hawkins is a nonfactor in the race and it will be 
settled nov 6 symington said 
should fate deal us an unusual hand id just live with it 
he added 
mecham won election in 1986 with 40 percent of the vote in a 
threeway race after a tumultuous reign he was convicted in a 
senate trial on two of three impeachment charges and was removed 
from office in april 1988 
voters changed the constitution that fall to require a runoff 
election when no candidate receives a majority 
but election officials doubt that a runoff could be arranged 
before the first monday in january thats when the new governor is 
to take office the regular legislative session begins the 
following monday 
going into a legislative session and not having a governor 
sworn in is a little scary goddard said 
arizona law says the governor will remain in office until a 
qualified successor is elected said john shadegg an assistant 
arizona attorney general that would extend the tenure of rose 
mofford who as secretary of state became governor when mecham was 
removed 
we just dont have any guidelines on a special election after 
a general election pima county elections director larry bahill 
said 
there is no provision for absentee voting in a runoff election 
said mrs osborne and helen purcell maricopa county recorder it 
also isnt clear whether ballots can be cast in runoff elections by 
voters who didnt vote in the preceding general election 
election officials lobbied lawmakers last session for amendments 
to specify how and when runoffs are to be held the proposals 
werent approved 
writein candidates rarely draw more than a few hundred votes 
but hawkins could be different because he could draw votes from the 
15 percent that staunchly has supported mecham 
mecham whose own comeback candidacy failed in the gop primary 
said he plans to vote for symington 
goddard and symington said they hadnt planned for the runoff 
possibility 
the lead time to set up a runoff election is for planning it 
determining who would be eligible to vote printing ballots hiring 
workers and scheduling polling places

about onefifth of the californians 
who will vote in tuesdays election are expected to cast absentee 
ballots a development that could delay announcement of the 
results says the secretary of states office 
most absentee ballots are counted as part of the electionnight 
semiofficial results but a substantial percentage are received on 
election day and wont be part of the electionnight count 
if we have 500000 absentee ballots outstanding it could take 
a couple of weeks to count them said melissa warren a 
spokeswoman for the secretary of states office between 7 million 
and 8 million people are expected to vote in california on tuesday 
a large number of absentee ballots could have a significant 
impact on the outcome of the race for governor and on when the 
winner is known two independent polls published thursday found 
republican sen pete wilson leading democratic former san francisco 
mayor dianne feinstein by just one percentage point 
we are expecting the absentee turnout to be substantial which 
could complicate the votecounting process and could put off 
announcing the results warren said 
in june 1990 about 15 percent of voters used absentee ballots 
in the last general election november 1988 about 14 percent voted 
absentee warren said

if i have fuzzy milquetoast nonsense boom youre off to

politicians are sheep he told a rotary club luncheon later 
they use negative ads because they work

democratic challenger tim roemer as comparative instead of 
negative 
i dont find anything particularly wrong with that he told 
the rotarians you have three to five seconds to grab a viewer i 
ran a campaign with fluffy ads in 1986 they got me a 47vote

the fbi says it dropped an investigation into 
a convicted murderers allegations that the bodies of black people 
killed by the ku klux klan were buried in a mass grave in fauquier 
county va 
the case was closed after the nevada inmate who made the 
allegations edward allan see 43 failed a polygraph test this 
week authorities said thursday 
fbi officials began looking into the claims in february after 
see who is serving two consecutive life sentences at ely state 
prison told them 50 people were buried in the warrenton area 45 
miles southwest of washington 
see who failed part of a polygraph test administered by the fbi 
in march also flunked the second test which was administered 
tuesday at ely authorities said 
based on that information we received today we have 
discounted the information provided by mr see to date and no 
further investigation will be done said thomas f jones fbi 
public affairs chief a second polygraph was given and an 
evaluation and review of that led us to believe that no further 
reaction is required in this matter 
william f dwyer a beverly hills calif attorney who 
represents see said he was disappointed by the fbis decision he 
urged the bureau to verify or discredit sees claims by excavating 
the alleged grave site 
he also said see wanted an independent polygraph test 
if the fbi has chosen to close the investigation based on 
eddie sees polygraph examination then it appears sweat affecting 
the polygraph is considered more reliable than a backhoe in 
unearthing what may or may not be buried remains of klan 
killings dwyer said 
see claims he participated in the killings of several blacks 
abducted from the washington area tortured and killed he says he 
was a member of the klan from 1961 to 1964

the woman who convinced a jury that boxer mike 
tyson grabbed her breasts and behind in a disco said she doesnt 
mind that she won only 100 in damages 
it was the principle sandra miller said thursday after the 
jury declined to award her any punitive damages he knows he did 
it i know he did it the jury proved that he did it 
the jury on wednesday ordered the former heavyweight champion to 
pay miller 100 in compensatory damages after finding that he

tyson testified during a fourday trial that he never touched 
miller

million and listened to another woman claim the boxer had reached 
under her dress the same night

testimony in round 2 of a comatose womans 
righttodie case ended without any opposition to letting her die 
her doctor and her stateappointed guardian agreed with family 
members and friends of 33yearold nancy cruzan who has been in an 
irreversible coma since 1983 
dr james c davis who opposed removing a feeding tube when the 
family first sought court permission to let her die three years 
ago changed his mind he said during a circuit court hearing 
thursday he favored the mercy death because he was convinced there 
was no hope for any improvement 
he said living for years in a coma without feeling or thought 
was a terrifying prospect 
i think it would be personally a living hell davis said 
asked if he would want someone to end his life if he were in her 
place davis replied i think anyone would choose that if they 
had observed that condition 
the us supreme court in its first righttodie decision last 
summer rejected a request by ms cruzans parents to end her life 
ruling the state could bar such moves if victims had not made their 
desires known 
ms cruzan left no written instructions about what she would 
want done under such circumstances 
the family went back to court saying they had new witnesses who 
could support their claims that she would want to die 
judge charles e teel who ruled in the parents favor before he 
was overruled said he would rule on the new petition by jan 1 
joe cruzan testified he knew his daughter would rather die than 
spend the rest of her life as a vegetable 
my god i wouldnt be here today if i thought there was any 
question he said his voice cracking 
two former coworkers and a former employer also said ms cruzan 
told them she would not want to live if she ever suffered permanent 
brain damage 
she went into a coma after a 1983 car crash doctors say she 
will never recover but could remain alive for 30 years or more in 
her currentcondition ms cruzans stateappointed guardian said 
he agreed with the cruzans and her personal physician that the 
feeding tube should be removed 
i think it clearly is not in her best interest to go on this 
way said the guardian thad mccanse im convinced nancy would 
not want to live like she is now 
debi havner who now lives in enid okla and marianne smith of 
joplin testified that while working with in 1978 at a school for 
severely handicapped children in joplin the three once agreed none 
of them would not want to be kept alive artificially 
tom turner the former owner of an oklahoma office products 
store where ms cruzan worked briefly in 1981 said in videotaped 
testimony that she also discussed her opposition to certain 
lifesustaining measures with him 
she said such things as vegetables cant hug their nieces 
turner said her family was a major portion of her life and if 
she couldnt have them she didnt want to live

movies as attack of the crab monsters wasp woman 
teenage caveman and shegods of shark reef returned to the

fonda 
corman 64 last directed a film the world war i drama von 
richthofen and brown in 1971 
about halfway through filming it i just realized i was 
getting tired corman said in an interview i had directed more 
than 50 films in something like 15 or 16 years 
i never intended to stop directing what i wanted to do was 
take the traditional sabbatical 
but it was not to be corman went on to produce scores of films 
including boxcar bertha piranha and humanoids from the 
deep 
corman is credited with giving early breaks to aspiring 
hollywood newcomers such as jack nicholson sylvester stallone 
martin scorsese charles bronson and ellen burstyn 
among his better known films are the masque of the red 
death the tomb of ligeia and the raven all adapted from 
edgar allan poe tales 
he also made the original the little shop of horrors 
featuring nicholson in 1960 
corman who cowrote and coproduced frankenstein unbound 
says the film budgeted at 9 million doesnt truly fit into the 
horror category though it depicts disemboweled animals 
decapitations impalings and a gruesome monster 
its not really a horror film not quite corman said 
its really a kind of science fictionfantasyhorror with a 
little bit of a moral point 
corman said his twodecade absence from behind the camera 
worried him at first 
as were driving out to the set for the first day of filming 
i thought am i really going to be able to pull this off corman 
said 
problems surfaced quickly 
we get there the cameras werent ready i immediately said 
all right fellas i told you i want the camera on the dolly over 
here lets lay the track get the camera out that wall over there 
is not dressed lets bring in the props lets get this thing 
moving he said 
i didnt even think about it until somebody brought me some 
coffee a few minutes later and i realized im just working again 
its as if i had stopped working last friday 
corman says hell direct again but for now hes off to europe 
where frankenstein unbound will the opening night feature at 
the first stockholm film festival 
the onetime lord of lowbudget movie fare still has an eye for a 
good deal 
they sent me a ticket he said and i figured i might as 
well go

thousands of children continue to drink water containing lead at 
school despite laws aimed at reducing lead contamination 
states have failed to enforce laws requiring schools to test 
drinking water for lead and the government has not provided 
adequate guidance on what water coolers pose a health risk 
according to an environmental protection agency report made 
available thursday 
lead is a powerful poison even traces can be harmful to 
children because it can hurt development of the brain and nervous 
system children under 7 are considered particularly vulnerable 
the epa inspector generals office estimated that based on a 
limited survey fewer than half of the school districts in the 
country may be testing thoroughly 
an examination of 13 school districts in the midatlantic region 
revealed that three had not tested for lead while most of the 
others conducted inadequate tests 
our findings confirm that harmful amounts of lead exist in the 
drinking water provided by schools both the epa and the states 
must be more aggressive in eliminating the health hazard imposed by 
lead in drinking water said the report 
three of the school districts pittsburgh richmond va and 
charleston wva had not tested for lead at the time of the 
survey the investigation was finished in april and the report 
completed in september 
the epa considers lead concentrations above 20 parts per billion 
to be hazardous to school children the report said that the agency 
believes every year more than 250000 children are exposed to lead 
level in drinking water that are high enough to impair their 
intellectual and physical development

federal health researchers tracking a dramatic 
rise in reported deaths from alzheimers disease say more awareness 
of the malady rather than a sharp rise in its incidence is the 
main reason 
its a little difficult to believe that the number of people 
with alzheimer disease could increase 950 percent in eight years 
said dr richard sun an epidemiologist at the us centers for 
disease control in atlanta 
our general feeling is heightened awareness was a little more 
important sun said thursday 
the cdc said in its weekly report that 11311 people or 42 per 
100000 population died from alzheimers disease in 1987 in 1979 
the first year of a cdc study 857 deaths or 04 per 100000 were 
attributed to the disease 
for the entire 197987 period alzheimers disease was listed as 
the underlying cause of death for 46202 people in the united 
states 
alzheimers disease tends to strike older people and because 
the us population is aging it is likely that incidence of the 
disease also is up though not as much as the death rate increase 
sun said 
he said there currently is no definitive study of how many 
people have alzheimers 
the disease characterized by progressive mental deterioration 
first was recognized in the early 1900s but public awareness of 
the disease was fairly limited until the 1970s 
doctors then sun said realized that alzheimer disease was a 
specific disease and not a normal process of aging there was 
something different about people with alzheimer disease 
the disease has gotten much media attention in the last 10 
years with television devoting prime time programs to it and 
national magazines featuring alzheimers on cover stories federal 
funding for research on alzheimers and related disorders rose from 
39 million in 1976 to 539 million in 1986 the atlantabased 
cdc reported 
sun said that in recent years doctors in some cases may have 
changed a diagnosis from senility to alzheimers as they began 
paying more attention to the latter 
sun said the death rate patterns reported by the cdc are 
consistent with those documented in england norway australia and 
canada 
the increase in the death rates for alzheimers disease came at 
the same time that rates for other leading causes of death such 
as heart ailments stroke liver diseases and hardening of the 
arteries were going down he said 
in a separate report the cdc said thursday that seven chronic 
diseases accounted for 795 percent of all deaths among the 
elderly chief among them was heart disease followed by malignant 
tumors cerebrovascular disease lung disease diabetes 
atherosclerosis and kidney disease the study was based on 1987 
medicare data

us district judge robert aguilar 
convicted of obstructing justice by leaking a wiretap and lying to 
the fbi was sentenced to six months in prison 
us district judge louis bechtle said thursday that aguilars 
crimes warranted a term of up to 27 months but he levied the 
lighter penalty because of aguilars likely impeachment 
these proceedings will be long and humiliating and 
embarrassing and burdensome a major and substantial punishment 
said bechtle a philadelphia judge assigned to the case by chief 
justice william rehnquist 
aguilar the third federal judge in us history sentenced to 
prison for felonies committed while on the bench faced a possible 
10year prison term and 500000 in fines prosecutors sought a 
minimum threeyear term 
the sentence includes fines and assessments of 2100 and 1000 
hours of community service during two years of supervised release 
after imprisonment aguilar remains free without bail during his 
appeal which defense lawyer paul meltzer said would take two 
years unless impeached the only way a federal judge can be 
removed involuntarily he will keep his title and salary he is 
not hearing cases but is available for settlement conferences 
aguilar 59 of san jose was appointed to the court in 1980 by 
president carter 
he declined to comment during or after the hearing but was 
smiling broadly when he walked up to meltzer in a hallway and 
thanked him 
it was a lighter sentence than we anticipated said jess 
aguilar one of the judges brothers 
another defendant former teamster leader rudy tham was 
sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined 20000 thursday for 
conspiring to seek illicit aid from aguilar in overturning his 
embezzlement conviction 
in a separate trial aguilar was acquitted of conspiracy in the 
tham case a jury convicted aguilar in august of two felony charges 
for disclosing a wiretap in february 1988 to reputed mobster abe 
chapman and lying in april 1988 to fbi agents who questioned him 
about the wiretap and his involvement in thams case 
a fellow judge had told aguilar in august 1987 that he had been 
seen with chapman whose name had come up in a wiretap application 
aguilars nephew testified that aguilar told him to tell chapman 
not to call him and mentioned a wiretap aguilar testified that he 
was only trying to warn chapman to stay away from him 
when fbi agents questioned aguilar two months later he told 
them he knew nothing of a wiretap on chapman and would not have 
told chapman if he had known 
aguilar was never accused of seeking personal gain unlike the 
two other federal judges imprisoned in the last decade harry 
claiborne of nevada convicted of tax evasion in 1984 and walter 
nixon of mississippi convicted of perjury in 1986 
prosecutors instead portrayed aguilar as a judge who wanted to 
impress his friends with his influence and lost his sense of 
limits

state health departments have embraced in 
principle a set of proposals issued two years ago for improving 
public medical care but the agencies have been slow to adopt the 
recommendations 
federal health officials arent sure why but say it may be 
because of a shortage of funds 
the institute of medicine which advises the federal government 
on public health issues made 66 recommendations in 1988 in 1989 
the state officials were surveyed by the association of state and 
territorial health officials on 25 of the proposals 
the us centers for disease control reported the results of the 
survey thursday 
among the findings 
fortyeight of 50 state health departments agreed they should 
link with mental health services to improve the integration of 
service delivery only 13 had done so eighteen more said they 
planned to 
all 50 state agencies agreed the public should be better 
educated on community health needs and policy issues only 34 had a 
program to achieve that goal 
fortyfive agreed state health departments should develop 
comprehensive strategies to influence healthrelated behavior just 
21 had implemented a plan 
in some areas there was consistency between agreement and 
implementation for instance 49 state departments agreed that food 
protection is a job for the agencies and 48 had such programs in 
place 
the survey did not get into why the recommendations were not 
implemented cdc epidemiologist dr arthur liang said but he said 
it was clear from the level of agreement noted in the survey that 
its not because of any lack of awareness or knowledge by state 
officials 
i think for some of these new areas new for public health 
perhaps there hasnt been a consensus between the policy makers 
and the taxpayers he said

president bush says a look at history will 
back up his suggestion that saddam hussein is a barbarian 
surpassing adolf hitler but experts on the nazi era disagree with 
him 
we dont see the kind of atrocities being committed in kuwait 
and iraq that would match those of nazi germany said richard 
breitman a professor of history at american university and a 
specialist in the hitler era 
no one yet and i hope no one ever will match up to the 
systematized brutalities and racist policies that adolf hitler 
committed said rabbi abraham cooper associate director of the 
simon wiesenthal center in los angeles 
the center is devoted to the study of the nazi holocaust in 
which an estimated 6 million jews were killed and its contemporary 
implications 
bush speaking at a republican rally in mashpee mass 
thursday said saddams iraqi invaders have committed outrageous 
acts of barbarism brutality i dont believe that adolf hitler 
ever participated in anything of that nature 
later at a news conference in orlando fla bush said i 
dont think i am overstating it i know i am not overstating the 
feelings i have about it i think the american people are as 
outraged as i am about the treatment of the people in our embassy 
for example and i think it is important that they know my concerns 
on this subject 
i was told that hitler did not stake people out against 
military targets the president said he did respect the 
legitimacy of the embassies so there are some differences 
he added i see many similarities between the iraqi behavior 
in kuwait and the way the deaths head regiments behaved in poland 
go back and take a look at the history and you can see why im as 
concerned as i am 
the deaths head units were notorious blackshirted ss troops 
that began as hitlers personal bodyguard they were blamed for 
many atrocities during the german invasion of poland 
breitman said many of the specific points bush made were correct 
and could make saddam appear worse than hitler in some respects 
but i dont think the overall record would show that to be the 
case 
he said that at the outbreak of world war ii the nazis interned 
foreign diplomats in conditions that were not comfortable but 
were nothing like what we are seeing in kuwait and iraq 
these diplomats were eventually exchanged for german diplomats 
in allied custody breitman said 
he said he was not aware that the nazis ever took hostages to 
potential military targets to use them as human shields as saddam 
has done 
cooper however said bush was absolutely wrong on the 
point 
look at the millions of people of all nationalities who were 
forced into slave labor factories in germany and many of them got 
blown away by the allied bombing missions he said 
breitman said hitler is not known to have visited any of the 
nazi death camps but that does not mean he was not involved 
he also said the activities of the deaths head units were 
only the tip of the iceberg in terms of brutality in poland by 
the german invaders 
the historian said he was not defending saddam he said the 
iraqi leader has committed crimes that give the idea of a 
nurembergtype trial a certain legitimacy to raise 
administration sources have said that such a trial along the lines 
of the war crimes trials held in nuremberg germany after world 
war ii is a possibility 
at the wiesenthal center rabbi cooper said saddam hussein 
has a list of crimes that i dont think has to be compared with 
anybody in order for the people of america to understand how 
serious a threat he represents 
but lets also keep this thing in some sort of perspective 
he said and to say that he outstrips adolf hitler i just think 
its either a slip of the tongue or a speech writer got carried 
away 
other jewish leaders generally agreed 
david harris executive vice president of the american jewish 
committee said both men each in his own way represents an 
incarnation of evil but to try and suggest that saddam hussein is 
a man of even greater evil than adolf hitler to me doesnt add to 
the discussion 
abraham foxman national director of the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith called bushs remark an unfortunate exaggeration 
that could hurt the presidents credibility at a time when it is 
very important that he remain credible 
saddam hussein is writing his own chapter of barbarism 
foxman said its the saddam hussein chapter and one need not 
compare or exaggerate

two bombs blamed on leftist radicals blew up in a 
police dormitory killing an officer and injuring six other people 
the blasts and other incidents today cast doubt on security efforts 
for emperor akihitos coronation 10 days away 
three unexploded bombs were found and a firebomb was hurled at a 
police station today after the blasts at the dormitory early this 
morning and late thursday night 
the violence occurred as 26000 police officers were mounting a 
massive security operation for the tuesday coronation 
representatives from more than 150 countries are to attend 
including vice president dan quayle and britains prince charles 
although scores of strategically located buildings or those 
related to the imperial household city utilities and other likely 
targets have been singled out for special attention under the 
security operation police dormitories were not included in the 
list 
i feel a very strong anger at the violent outrage of the 
ultraleftist groups tachio ohori head of the metropolitan 
police department told japanese reporters in a hastily arranged 
predawn news conference called after he inspected the blast site 
with all the strength of the department we hope to 
successfully carry out security for the upcoming coronation he 
was quoted as saying in several major newspapers 
no group claimed responsibility as of this evening japanese 
radical groups generally take several days to issue such 
statements 
officer hiroshi aoki 48 died almost immediately after the 
first blast at 11 pm thursday at the dormitory in a tokyo 
district known for its numerous nightspots the second bomb went 
off about five minutes later officials said earlier that the bombs 
exploded two hours apart 
a metropolitan police department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the injured included four other 
officers the dorms cook and another civilian 
the official said the type of explosives and other details of 
the blasts separated by about two hours were under investigation 
both bombs had been placed near a garbage collection area inside 
the dormitory complex officials said 
along with the dormitory blasts police reported finding two 
more bombs near another police dormitory about an hour after the 
first blasts and at a public restroom elsewhere in the capital 
early today 
in central japan a molotov cocktail was lobbed at a police 
station before dawn no injuries were reported 
leftist radicals including the 5000member chukakuha or 
middle core faction have repeatedly vowed to use violence to 
destroy the coronation and other related ceremonies they 
consider the emperor a symbol of japans militarist past and oppose 
state funding of the enthronement 
last month police announced they would increase the security 
deployment to 32000 by busing in reinforcements for the coronation 
day on wednesday it was revealed that they are considering a 
further increase of thousands more 
we have not made a final decision but an increase is being 
considered because of the increasing difficulty of the situation 
a national police agency official said 
metropolitan police department officials today also refused to 
comment on whether the thousands will be added 
leftist radicals have been particularly active in antiimperial 
activities since the funeral of emperor hirohito in february last 
year 
although police mobilized 32000 officers in tokyo to guard that 
ceremony the chukakuha set off a bomb along the funeral 
procession route the bomb exploded before the procession arrived 
and no one was injured 
over the past month police have announced uncovering alleged 
plots by the chukakuha to jam television broadcasts of the 
coronation and fire rockets at a tunnel along a train route the 
emperor is to travel later this month 
the radical group is believed to have mortarstyle weapons with 
a range of 4 miles

the ukrainian government today began issuing 
rationing cards in what was seen as an effort to prevent hoarding 
and to keep scarce products from being sold outside the republic 
some ukrainian nationalists saw the move as a prelude to issuing 
a currency in the southwestern republic whose parliament declared 
sovereignty in july 
the immediate result however was confusion and long lines of 
angry shopers in kiev the ukrainian capital media reports said 
each worker student and pensioner receives coupons equivalent 
to 70 percent of their monthly income along with the cash under 
the system decreed by the ukrainian council of ministers last 
friday 
the coupons good for six months and marked with cash values 
similar to ruble notes must be presented along with rubles to 
purchase basic goods such as food gasoline cigarettes and 
liquor 
only slightly more than half of kievs residents have been 
given coupons the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said in a 
report from the ukrainian capital others were not so lucky 
the newspaper said that most people were caught unaware by the 
new measures announced last friday on radio and television 
during the day many streets of the capital were blocked by 
groups of angry people it said 
chris kedzie an american economic researcher living in kiev 
said it is a very confusing and difficult situation people were 
caught by surprise 
he said there were no specific instuctions issued on how to use 
the coupons and state stores were closed three times during the 
week as managers prepared for the new system 
kedzie said the primary goal of the coupons according to 
economists he interviewed was to keep ukrainian goods inside the 
republic and feed their own people during the winter 
this is a stopgap measure there are not enough food and goods 
for the winter he said people are stocking up on 
everything 
the independent ukrainian information agency said this 
resolution was adopted in hurry without proposing it for the 
preliminary discussion by the population 
it said the coupon system will not properly provide for the 
needs of families lead to black marketeering and result in 
inflated prices 
petro borsuk an official of the nationalist ukrainian republic 
party said he was optimistic the coupon system would take root 
i see it as a first step toward a ukrainian national 
currency he said in a telephone interview 
vladimir pylutchuk a member of the supreme soviet economic 
reform committee said the coupon system could be seen in the 
context of creating a ukrainian currency but not in the immediate 
future 
for the time being he told kedzie in an interview its a way 
to keep goods in the republic 
all but one of the 15 soviet republics have declared some form 
of autonomy from moscow the only holdout is kirgizia a central 
asian republic and its legislature is expected to declare 
sovereignty soon

mcdonalds corps decision to switch from 
polystyrene containers to paper for its food products is being 
hailed by some but not all environmentalists 
it is a mistake to make plastic the great satan and paper the 
great saint said jan beyea a scientist at the national audubon 
society both processes generate pollution 
a recycling company meanwhile lamented mcdonalds announcement 
thursday that it would start phasing out its clamshellshaped 
containers which had been blamed for filling landfills and 
depleting the ozone layer within two months 
the fastfood giant had been playing a key role in educating the 
public about the need to recycle said e james schneiders 
president of national polystyrene recycling co 
mcdonalds just last week said it planned to expand an 
experimental plastic recycling program to all of its 8500 us 
restaurants 
nprc is disappointed to learn that mcdonalds has decided to 
phase out its use of polystyrene foam packaging schneiders said 
but the nonprofit environmental defense fund which had worked 
with mcdonalds since august on plans to phase out the plastic foam 
containers was elated 
mcdonalds understands that the future is green said 
frederic d krupp the funds executive director i think other 
companies will follow suit 
several us cities have banned the use of polystyrene foam 
saying it contributes to landfill problems by lingering for years 
before disintegrating the polystyrene production process also is 
suspected of harming the earths ozone level 
although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging 
is environmentally sound our customers just dont feel good about 
it mcdonalds corp president edward rensi said by telephone 
thursday from the companys suburban oak brook headquarters so 
were changing 
joseph bow president of the foodservice amp packaging institute 
in washington accused mcdonalds of bowing to public pressure 
that is based on misconceptions and misinformation 
you dont want to get rid of them polystyrene products all 
together he said they provide consumers with a sanitary and 
timesaving method of food delivery 
a spokeswoman for the environmental protection agency in 
washington robin woods said her agency had no studies that 
indicated foam packaging is environmentally sound but she also 
said it may not be an environmental hazard because its inert 
its not something that breaks down easily and leeches into 
landfills for example 
mcdonalds said the foam containers will be replaced by paper 
products manufactured in a new process that will preserve the 
foods temperature and freshness 
mcdonalds vice president shelby yastrow said the polystyrene 
containers are made for mcdonalds by several companies including 
amoco foam products co mobil corp jenpak and huntsman 
chemical amoco foam president john giroux said 10 percent of his 
companys polystyrene sales were to mcdonalds 
rensi said the sandwich containers represent about 75 percent of

palestinians in the occupied lands cannot 
count on israel to protect them and the united nations may call 
for a meeting to ensure their safety under international law the 
un chief says 
israels un mission rejected thursdays comments by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar as interference and said 
israel has sole control of the territories 
perez de cuellars proposals came in an 11page report ordered 
by the un security council after the oct 8 killings of 20 arabs 
by israeli forces during rioting in arab east jerusalem the 
council has already condemned israel for the bloodshed 
perez de cuellar did not make specific recommendations on 
deploying un observers or peacekeepers to monitor the territories 
captured from arab neighbors in the 1967 mideast war 
arabs have sought un intervention 
palestine liberation organization representative riyad mansour 
said the report was positive but fell short 
we would have preferred stronger and clearer recommendations 
through recommendations by the secretarygeneral to the council 
to dispatch a un force to provide protection mansour said he 
said such a proposal would soon be made to the security council 
arab leaders have compared israels occupation to iraqs control 
of kuwait they have chastized the united nations for its more 
subdued response to israels occupation 
perez de cuellar said the palestinians distrust of israeli 
authorities had grown so deep that they felt that only an 
impartial presence properly mandated by the united nations would 
be able to provide them with a credible sense of protection 
he did not support or reject that suggestion however 
the tragic events of oct 8 1990 are only the most recent of 
many grave incidents in the occupied territories that have resulted 
in the deaths and wounding of a large number of civilians perez 
de cuellar said 
israeli forces intervened in riots in jerusalem on that day 
after arabs started throwing stones at praying jews 
perez de cuellar said that despite the need for protection of 
palestinians the essential underlying problem is a political 
conflict that lies at the heart of the tragic events 
for any measure or protection to be ensured the cooperation 
of the israeli authorities is under present circumstances 
absolutely essential he said 
the security council had proposed sending an investigating team 
to israel but israeli authorities said they would bar any un 
envoys from carrying out such a mission 
the secretarygeneral said thursday that the security council 
might wish to call for a meeting of the 164 nations that signed the 
1949 fourth geneva convention on protection of civilians in 
wartime 
he indicated such a gathering could consider how protective 
measures should be imposed and whether a protecting power 
should be designated in the occupied territories 
the convention which israel signed prohibits mistreatment of 
civilians deportations collective punishment or destruction of 
property 
diplomats said they could not recall a prior meeting of the 164 
signatories to reassess the convention and decide how it should be 
applied to new situations 
yuval rotem a spokesman for israels un mission said his 
countrys responsibility under the geneva accord is not subject 
to review or intervention by other authorities 
he said the status of the occupied west bank and gaza strip is 
not clear under international law and the geneva convention 
regarding occupied territory does not legally apply 
however rotem said israel had decided to act in accordance with 
the conventions humanitarian provisions 
under established rules of international law he said 
israel has the sole responsibility for the administration of 
these areas including the duty to maintain law and order 
at least 765 palestinians have been killed by israelis during 
the nearly 3yearold palestinian uprising against israeli rule of 
the occupied lands at least 290 palestinians have been killed by 
fellow arabs most as suspected collaborators more than 50 
israelis also have died

erich honecker ousted communist leader of former 
east germany says in a newspaper interview published today that in 
the long run i will be seen to have been right 
the weekly newspaper the european quoted him as saying that his 
former countrymen and women now in a united germany since oct 3 
are becoming aware of the rights and social services they have 
lost 
he also predicted communism will return to eastern europe 
reversing the revolution that swept east germany and the rest of 
the region last year 
honecker 78 was head of state in the former east germany from 
1976 until he was toppled oct 18 last year he was arrested on 
charges of treason last january 
the paper printed by londonbased publisher robert maxwell and 
circulated throughout europe said he was interviewed in a small 
apartment within a soviet military hospital compound outside 
berlin 
it said the interview was conducted by heinz judge a comrade of 
honecker in the antinazi resistance 
the paper said honecker expressed no fear in the interview of 
facing criminal charges 
i am not afraid of a show trial i consider all the charges so 
far brought by the prosecutors office untenable honecker was 
quoted as saying 
i also reject responsibility for the figure cited by the 
prosecutors office of 200 killed on the gdr german democratic 
republic east germany borders i have no personal guilt for 
that and what i ask myself about those who killed gdr border 
guards while violating our frontiers 
the paper quoted him as saying it had been a great 
disappointment for me that so many people have forgotten socialism 
and turned to the dmark instead 
but i am not afraid that former gdr citizens would threaten me 
or lynch me despite the demonstration cries and banner slogans of 
the socalled democrats quite the contrary in the end i will be 
seen to have been right he said 
it has already become quite obvious to all what rights and 
social services they have lost honecker said 
he contended that the communist parties of the old east bloc had 
been brought down by intrigues but that they could bounce back 
what is needed now honecker was quoted as saying is a 
merciless investigation of the reasons for what has happened and 
the relevant conclusions to be drawn the communist movement has 
certainly suffered a defeat but it will recover 
he offered no apologies for his years in power 
everything i did i did in the knowledge that i was doing 
something for the people and for peace in the present situation 
they need scapegoats and i am being made the biggest one he 
said 
my wife and i are shocked by the allegations and calumnies 
against us we are accused of corruption and selfenrichment at the 
expense of the people honecker said but margot and i have 
nothing to reproach ourselves with we did not lead a life of 
luxury and we do not have a bank account in switzerland

the fbi will review reports that terrorists 
exploited an undercover drug operation to bomb pan am flight 103 
but there is nothing thus far to support them the justice 
department says 
deputy attorney general william p barr said thursday in a 
statement that at this time we know of no evidence giving 
credence to these allegations but it was important to determine 
their credibility as soon as possible 
the department said the fbi will review reports by nbctv and 
abctv that terrorists penetrated a drug enforcement administration 
operation to put explosives aboard the 1988 flight that ended in a 
bomb explosion over lockerbie scotland 
in germany an official also said investigators would examine 
the reports but added that an earlier inquiry had failed to 
substantiate them 
frankfurt city prosecutor hubert harth said investigators there 
had examined the charges a year ago he said the information then 
pertained not to the dea but to a drugtracing operation of the 
central intelligence agency 
there was absolutely no confirmation in this direction 
harth said nonetheless we will once more examine these new 
reports 
the networks reported tuesday that terrorists might have 
substituted baggage containing bombs for suitcases loaded with 
heroin that dea had placed on usbound planes to track the routes 
of lebanese drug traffickers 
fbi director william sessions speaking to reporters in glasgow 
scotland refused to comment on the network reports 
sessions expressed confidence that the bombers would be brought 
to justice but indicated that the investigation could take 
additional years 
we will not let go we are not only tenacious but we are 
diligent about our responsibility said sessions 
the fbi investigated similar reports a year ago and found no 
basis for them said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
dea spokesman bill ruzzamenti said there was absolutely no 
evidence whatsoever in anything we have done preliminarily to 
substantiate any claims about any involvement by dea in any way 
with pan am 103 
nbc reported that terrorists may have discovered an arrangement 
between dea and german security officials that allowed them to 
substitute explosivesfilled suitcases for luggage that contained 
heroin 
the bombing killed 259 people aboard the usbound flight and 
11 more on the ground 
the new yorkbound flight originated in frankfurt and stopped in 
london where passengers and luggage were transferred to a larger 
airplane

special travel documents 
allowing political exiles entrance to south africa will be issued 
to speed their return home affairs minister gene louw announced 
today 
louw spoke a day after the government said it was ready to begin 
releasing political prisoners and allow the largescale return of 
exiles in accordance with an earlier agreement with the african 
national congress 
the actions indicate the government wants constitutional 
negotiations with the anc and other opposition groups to proceed as 
quickly as possible 
also today the independent south african press association 
reported that parents at an elite afrikaner school near cape town 
have voted to accept students of all races making it thefirst of 
its kind to open its doors to blacks 
the parents of groote schuur laerskool voted overwhelmingly to 
remain a governmentfunded school with autonomy over admissions 
requirements the news agency said 
elsewhere in south africa more black factional fighting 
thursday night left at least five people dead officials said 
release of political prisoners and the return of thousands of 
exiles have been key anc demands in peace talks with the government 
designed to set up fullscale negotiations 
in august the government agreed in principle to the demands 
but implementation was delayed by disputes in the talks with the 
anc 
membership in the anc and other antigovernment organizations 
was a crime in south africa until february when president fw de 
klerk legalized 60 opposition groups and movements thousands of 
people had fled the country to avoid arrest 
justice minister kobie coetsee on thursday released the first 
report of a governmentanc working group on the prisoner and exile 
issues the report set guidelines for anc exiles prisoners and 
fugitives to apply for indemnity from prosecution for acts 
committed during the groups 30year guerrilla war against the 
whiteled government 
the anc suspended its largely dormant armed struggle in august 
to meet government demands 
coetsee said the government could now proceed in a phased 
manner with the agreement to release political prisoners and 
bring back exiles he said the rate of implementation would depend 
on the ancs adherence to its promise to end all violence 
the anc has said it has 20000 exiles and estimates there are 
about 1500 political prisoners the government has not given 
figures for either category 
exiles seeking to return will fill out applications stating 
their past acts but coetsee said the information could not be used 
against them in a court of law 
a special committee will be set up to review applications and 
the justice ministry also will consider some applications coetsee 
would not say who will be on the committee 
fighting between mine workers of different tribes erupted at a

group of unidentified assailants opened fire with automatic weapons 
thursday night on three houses in stanger police said

attorney general steve clark was spared 
jail time after his conviction for using his state credit card to 
boost his brief run for governor and sagging personal finances 
clark was fined 10000 thursday after the jury convicted him of 
felony theft by deception 
i think its important that steve clark as attorney general 
was treated like any other person in the system prosecutor chris 
piazza said after the verdict was announced 
obviously im very disappointed said clark 43 as ive 
said all along it was never my intention to defraud or deceive 
defense attorney bill bristow said an appeal was likely 
jurors convicted clark of a less severe crime than the one 
prosecutors filed against him deciding the theft amounted to less 
than 2500 but more than 200 clark who is paid 26500 a year 
as attorney general had been charged with stealing more than 
2500 
clark said he would make a decision whether to resign his office 
within 24 hours bristow scheduled an afternoon news conference to 
answer questions about clarks future 
todd mccall spokesman for the attorney generals office said 
the state constitution requires clark to resign because of his 
felony conviction 
mccall would not comment on whether clark could remain in office 
if he appeals the verdict 
jurors deliberated for just over four hours before arriving at 
the verdict circuit judge perry v whitmore followed the jurys 
sentencing recommendation by fining clark and sparing him jail 
time 
i didnt want to see the man go to prison said juror brenda 
beall 27 of north little rock my god he has suffered enough 
but we didnt want him to get away with taking our money your 
money my money 
piazza argued successfully that clark used a state visa card to 
prop up his gubernatorial campaign and failing personal finances 
before discrepancies in his expense records were exposed in the 
arkansas gazette clark announced he would seek the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination he dropped out of the race a few weeks 
later after dozens of people told reporters they didnt attend 
dinner parties where clark reported them as guests or said the 
meals were strictly social affairs 
piazza said clark used the credit card to help raise campaign 
contributions that ended up in his personal checking account five 
women friends of clark testified they shared meals with him that 
were charged to the state

police fatally shot at least 10 hindu 
fundamentalists today repulsing a renewed assault on a moslem 
mosque in a religious dispute that has left more than 250 people 
dead nationwide 
more than 60 people and three police officers were injured in 
the clash 
the conflict has spilled into moslem bangladesh where two more 
people died today from antihindu rioting pakistans caretaker 
prime minister said india is not doing enough to protect moslem 
shrines 
about 10000 hindus tried to storm the hilltop babri mosque 
which they want to replace with a hindu temple in ayodhya 300 
miles southeast of new delhi the conflict in the northeastern town 
threatens to bring down the government of prime minister vp 
singh 
police used tear gas and pushed back the crowds with blows from 
6footlong bamboo staves reporters saw scores of people injured 
before the crowd retreated down dirt alleys and into buildings 
police opened fire after coming under a repeated barrage of 
stones from the roofs of buildings witnesses saw police chasing 
the militants onto the roofs and firing on the crowds in the narrow 
lanes below 
reporters counted 10 bodies in the streets and in a hospital 
witnesses claimed more people were killed and hindu militants 
refused to let them take away the corpses 
doctors at faizabad hospital said they treated 64 people for 
injuries including 48 hit by gunfire six of those injured were in 
critical condition three injured policemen were also brought to 
the hospital 
one of the injured hindus bhupendra singh rawat 24 accused 
the police of shooting needlessly 
two policemen dragged a man out of the house and shot him in 
the chest then they also shot two people who were crying over a 
dead body they were shot in the back he said speaking from a 
hospital bed 
today was the last day of a fourday pilgrimage period declared 
by astrologers and hindu holy men as the auspicious time for 
beginning construction of the temple 
at least 257 people have been killed in an unrelenting wave of 
violence in six indian states since the fighting began oct 24 
according to a tally of official reports and news agency accounts 
singhs government vowed to defend the moslem site until the 
courts decide its fate his stand cost him his majority in 
parliament when a hindu party withdrew its support last week 
he faces a noconfidence motion nov 7 which he appears likely 
to lose moves were afoot to replace him as leader of the janata 
dal party which might rescue the governing national front 
coalition from defeat in parliament 
jockeying in the janata dal centered on two ruralbased 
politicians devi lal and chandra shekhar who command wide 
followings among lowerclass hindus singh was elected last year 
largely on the strength of the middle class which grew 
disenchanted with the congress party headed by rajiv gandhi 
the ayodhya dispute ignited religious tensions in neighboring 
bangladesh an islamic nation with a hindu minority three people 
were reported killed and more than 350 were wounded in three days 
of rioting in dhaka the capital and in 12 other cities 
doctors said two people died of bullet wounds in dhaka early 
today one moslem businessman died wednesday of wounds suffered in 
dhaka 
hindus say the 460yearold babri mosque was built on the 
foundation of an early hindu temple marking the birthplace of rama 
the muchworshiped warrior god moslems dispute the history of the 
site and say that relinquishing the site would jeopardize hundreds 
of other moslem sites

a judge today ordered a palestinianamerican 
held for questioning on suspicion he carried out a fatal bus 
attack the suspect was the first to be extradited from the united 
states during the palestinian uprising 
mahmoud atta allegedly a member of the abu nidal terrorist 
group is accused of taking part in a 1986 machine gun attack on a 
bus carrying jewish settlers in the west bank the driver was 
killed and a passenger wounded 
his lawyer accused police of violating the extradition agreement 
barring mistreatment by denying atta a change of clothes and a 
shower since his arrival in israel on wednesday 
police invited all the camera crews and then presented him 
dirty and unshaven defense lawyer leah tzemel told reporters 
outside the courtroom this is how you build an image of a 
terrorist 
atta 37 also known as mahmoud elabed ahmed flashed a victory 
sign to dozens of photographers with a shackled hand before being 
led into the courtroom of jerusalem magistrate moshe ravid 
ravid granted a police request that atta be held 15 days for 
questioning 
i guess the americans wouldnt have extradited him if they 
didnt have some evidence against him ravid said 
atta an american citizen was arrested by us authorities 
three years ago on aug 31 the us supreme court rejected his 
final appeal of extradition and he was brought to israel 
he was the first suspect extradited from the united states 
during the nearly 35monthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation in the west bank and gaza strip 
the abu nidal group threatened to attack us targets if atta 
was extradited following the threats the state department issued 
an unusual warning that abu nidals group was planning a revenge 
attack on a passenger ship in the eastern mediterranean 
ms tzemel said today that unidentified security agents 
including a hebrewspeaker originally captured atta in venezuela 
and interrogated him for nine days before delivering him to 
american authorities on june 6 1987 
atta sat silently during the 90minute hearing listening to an 
arabic translation of the hebrew proceedings his feet remained 
shackled 
no indictment has been handed down against atta and he did not 
enter a plea he has repeatedly said he was innocent 
it is routine in israel for suspects to be held for police 
interrogation before charges are brought

a halloween attack on a group of homeless men 
that left one dead and nine injured was an indication that new york 
residents dont see homeless people as human beings the citys 
human rights commissioner said 
a dozen young people some dressed in halloween costumes yelled 
trick or treat before attacking the men with bats pipes 
knives and meat cleavers said capt steve davis a police 
spokesman 
carlos melendez 35 was killed when the gang slashed his 
throat he was pronounced dead at the scene davis said 
what we are witnessing here is a dehumanization process which 
is already under way said human rights commissioner dennis 
deleon as new yorkers we must all realize that the homeless are 
human beings with rights like all the rest of us which must be 
recognized and enforced 
the attackers aged 16 to 25 waited in a dark wooded area and

five of the injured men were treated at a hospital and released 
three others were treated by police at a precinct house and 
another man was listed as stable at harlem hospital after he was 
beaten about the face with a baseball bat

the prospect of a meeting called by the united 
nations to ensure the safety of palestinians raised fears here 
today about israels increasing isolation in the world community 
united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
thursday suggested the meeting saying palestinians in the occupied 
lands cannot count on israel to protect them 
his proposals came in an 11page report ordered by the un 
security council after the oct 8 killings of 20 arabs by israeli 
forces during rioting in arab east jerusalem the council has 
already condemned israel for the bloodshed 
israels un mission rejected the secretarygenerals comments 
as interference and said israel has sole control of the 
territories 
the foreign ministry scheduled a briefing for reporters on the 
latest un move then canceled it ministry officials said they 
stood by the israeli un missions response 
yossi achimeir an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir told 
the daily newspaper davar that israel was doing everything to 
ensure the security of the 17 million palestinians in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
if there is any lack of security it derives from the violent 
activities of the arabs against israelis and their own brethern 
achimeir was quoted as saying 
misha harish of the opposition labor party said the centerleft 
party rejected the call for an international meeting but his 
statement criticized shamir for refusing any un investigation of 
the temple mount deaths 
shamir is creating unnecessary conficts with the president of 
the united states and the rest of the nations of the world 
harish said 
diplomats quoted in the haaretz newspaper said they were 
concerned by perez de cuellars suggestion the meeting by the 164 
nations that signed the 1949 fourth geneva convention would be to 
consider how to protect palestinians in the disputed lands 
the diplomats expressed fears that an another israeli rejection 
of a un action would erode the jewish states international 
standing haaretz said 
the fears by the unidentified diplomats were echoed by veteran 
statesman abba eban who said the continued focus of un attention 
on israel was harmful not only to the jewish state but to the arab 
and western alliance against iraq 
there are many in the country who believe there has been 
damage by all this activity around our problem at a time when 
the main interest of israel now is to actually help strengthen the 
great coalition that was formed against saddam hussein the 
former foreign minister told army radio

rallied in front of the news building on thursday temporarily 
closing a block on 42nd street 
dozens of labor leaders and politicians urged the strikers to 
continue their fight cardinal john oconnor sent a letter saying 
i do not believe that union members wanted to initiate the 
current strike 
police initially estimated the crowd at 5000 but later changed 
their estimate to 13000 they reported no arrests or injuries 
during the demonstration but several scuffles erupted 
the news says it printed and distributed 106 million copies 
despite a strike by nine of its 10 unions but availability of the 
paper remained spotty 
in the rego park section of queens today a stationery store was 
hit by arson a little after 4 am said sgt tina mohrmann a

former air force capt michele hegler said 
fear of developing the kind of aneurysm that killed five of her 
relatives led to her participation in research that has uncovered a 
genetic cause of the disease 
i was scared but i didnt hesitate because so many in our 
family had died the houston resident said thursday now that i 
know my family and i can take precautions 
thomas jefferson university researchers announced a discovery 
thursday that linked mrs heglers genetic defect to aortic 
aneurysms a disorder that afflicts about 2 million americans 
the university researchers also said they developed a saliva 
test to detect the mutation which can be used to identify which of 
mrs heglers relatives are at risk 
our study proves for the first time that there is a genetic 
cause for aortic aneurysms in people who do not have any other 
signs of a genetic disease said dr darwin prockop the lead 
researcher 
for someone with the genetic defect prockop said their chances 
of developing an aneurysm is almost 100 percent 
in 1988 physicians discovered while examining mrs hegler that 
several family members had died from ruptured aortic aneurysms an 
aortic aneurysm is a balloonlike swelling in the bodys largest 
blood vessel 
of the 2 million americans at risk of developing an aortic 
aneurysm during their lives some 15000 die each year die when the 
aneurysms burst causing massive bleeding the ruptures most often 
occur in the arteries of the heart and brain 
the discovery is a major breakthrough that can now offer 
physicians a way of anticipating and preventing the dire 
consequences of aortic aneurysms said dr roger ladda of the 
penn state medical center 
ladda said scientists can build on the work to detect similar 
mutations in other families and possibly uncover a universal 
mutation 
the study was reported in thursdays journal of clinical 
investigation published by rockefeller university in new york 
the researchers discovered a single mutation among the 30000 
units in the gene responsible for a protein that is part of the 
building blocks that make up the blood vessels walls mrs 
heglers defective protein weakens the vessel walls leading to the 
rupture 
prockop said they focused on the collagen called type iii 
procollagen because it determines the strength of the aortic 
walls 
prockop and the scientists found the same defect in preserved 
tissue samples of mrs heglers mother who died in 1960 and her 
aunt who died in 1986 both suffered ruptured aortic aneurysms 
the researchers then developed a test to look for the same 
defect in other relatives 
mrs hegler said 10 relatives agreed to join the research and 
four including mrs heglers two children and her brother carry 
the defective gene 
mrs heglers 15yearold son no longer plays football and her 
17yearold daughter has dropped gymnastics the family goes 
together for checkups to detect any aneurysms 
physicians had attributed most aneurysms in people without any 
known genetic disease to atherosclerosis which also weakens blood 
vessels while clogging them with cholesterol 
if a physician discovers an aneurysm before it ruptures 
surgeons can repair the blood vessel by patching it much like a 
tire but almost all patients whose aortic aneurysms rupture die 
despite emergency surgery prockop said 
in a related development detailed maps of the brain 
developed by university of florida physicians are allowing doctors 
to treat 90 percent of the formerly untreatable brain aneurysms 
dr arthur day of the universitys department of neurosurgery 
reported an outstanding rate of safety and success in 
diagnosing and surgically treating 80 patients with aneurysms of 
the ophthalmic segment of the carotid artery over the past nine 
years 
the carotid artery carries the major part of the brains blood 
supply while the ophthalmic segment is named for its location near 
the branch that supplies blood to the eye 
day credits much of his success in safely reaching and treating 
ophthalmic segment aneurysms to the detailed studies of the brains 
anatomy undertaken by dr albert rhoton chairman of the department 
of neurosurgery

hyosuke niwa a 79yearold former japanese labor 
minister died today of heart failure caused by excessive bleeding 
officials said his death came 12 days after he was stabbed by a 
mental patient 
an autopsy report revealed niwa was given the wrong blood type 
during emergency transfusions which could have contributed to his 
death 
niwa had been in a coma in aichi medical university hospital 
since he was stabbed said a spokesman for the hospital in central 
japan 
niwa who had type o blood was given type b blood during 
transfusions at two hospitals according to the autopsy by medical 
staff at nagoya university 
heart failure was listed as the official cause of death but 
officials suspect the transfusion mistake may have hastened niwas 
death kyodo news service reported 
mixing blood types can cause red blood cells to rupture and 
clump together niwa had been in a coma in aichi medical university 
hospital since he was stabbed said a spokesman for the hospital in 
central japan 
niwa was attacked oct 21 while walking to a military ceremony 
at the moriyama military base in nagoya 170 miles west of tokyo

the minnesota supreme court has settled a 
dispute over the republican gubernatorial ticket that arose when 
jon grunseth withdrew from the race amid allegations of sexual 
misconduct 
the court voted 52 thursday to reject sharon clarks claim that 
she should be the candidate for lieutenant governor on the ballot 
with primary runnerup arne carlson 
clarks attorney had argued that clark was legally entitled to 
the lieutenant governors candidacy because she won the sept 11 
primary as grunseths running mate 
grunseth withdrew sunday after reports that he swam nude with 
teenage girls nine years ago and had a mistress during both of his 
marriages 
but the court said secretary of state joan growe did not err in 
deciding joanell dyrstad carlsons primary running mate should 
join him on supplementary ballots for the nov 6 election 
chief justice peter popovich in a sharply worded twopage 
dissent said the republican party had failed to fulfill the 
basic duty owed to its members by asking the court to settle the 
dispute 
avoiding its duty and requiring the court to settle the 
political differences within that party is disrespectful of the 
role of the judiciary and a misuse of the judicial process 
popovich wrote 
the dispute began after the minnesota independentrepublican 
partys executive committee on tuesday decided the party had no 
committee empowered to fill the vacancy created by grunseths 
withdrawal 
given the partys conclusion growe said state law requires that 
the runnerup in the primary become the gop nominee 
party officials said the committee decided to leave the 
runningmate decision to the court 
clark thanked the court for hearing the case and pledged 100 
percent support to carlson and dyrstad 
i had to do what i felt was right and what i owed the primary 
voters she said in a statement 
growe said she would order supplementary paper ballots for the 
governors race to be printed by 5 pm friday 
a 1972 constitutional amendment mandated that candidates for 
governor and lieutenant governor run as teams to insure that the 
candidates would be substantially politically and personally 
compatible chief deputy attorney general jack tunheim said in a 
brief filed on growes behalf 
popovich rejected that argument in his dissent 
the inevitable result of this reasoning is that an incumbent 
governor could not appear on the ballot if the lieutenant governor 
withdrew at th last minute he wrote doubtless the 
legislature could not have intended such an unreasonable and absurd 
result

the government today ordered the army to 
seize weapons and close checkpoints operated by militias in the 
christian enclave seized from rebel gen michel aoun 
the announcement by defense minister albert mansour was the 
latest step in president elias hrawis plan to remove all militias 
from beirut and eventually disband and disarm them 
but the government order was confined only to a 80squaremile 
strip of territory north of beirut and did not appear to signal a 
general crackdown on private armies in beirut and its environs 
the militias are responsible for most of the estimated 150000 
deaths during lebanons 15yearold civil war 
christian leaders samir geagea and george saddeh had demanded 
the removal of syrianbacked militias who have moved into aouns 
territory since the generals 11monthold mutiny was crushed oct 
13 more than 550 people were killed and 1200 wounded in the 
syrianled attack 
mansour said in an order to the army commander gen emile 
lahoud all military manifestations should be removed the 
possession and transport of illegal weapons should be banned 
the directive allows the army to raid suspected weapons 
caches and prevent the militias in aouns former territory 
maintaining checkpoints there 
it also said buildings seized by militias by force and used as 
centers for the private armies should be turned over to their 
legal owners 
the directive said in the event of disobediance force is to 
be used 
there were no response by two syriansupported militias in the 
area the syrian social nationalist party and christian gunmen led 
by militia chieftain elie hobeika syria the main power broker in 
lebanon and a backer of hrawi is likely to tell them to comply 
with mansours directive 
but hrawi faces considerable difficulties in his ultimate aim of 
disbanding and disarming lebanons private armies under an arab 
leagemediated peace plan to end the civil war 
the four main christian and moslem militias have pledged to 
withdraw their fighters from a greater beirut in line with the 
government plan 
the militias are the lebanese forces the druse moslem 
progressive socialist party the proiranian shiite moslem 
hezbollah or party of god and the more secular syrianbacked 
shiite amal movement 
the peace pact ratified by parliament calls for the equal 
distribution of power between the majority moslems and the long

a congressional investigative report that 
accuses former housing secretary samuel pierce of being less than 
honest in the hud scandals also points a finger at congress itself 
the report by the house government operations committee ending 
a 16month investigation of the department of housing and urban 
development by its housing subcommittee said congress as well as 
the administration should end practices that bring political 
influence to federal housing decisions 
there is a need to take politics and discretion out of housing 
programs the report said this applies equally to the 
executive and legislative branches 
congress allotted some 30 million for 40 housing projects 
favored by house and senate members in the supplemental 
appropriations bill for fiscal 1990 which ended sept 30 similar 
projects were funded in appropriations for the current fiscal year 
as well 
just as it was wrong for hud under secretary pierce to dole 
out housing units and grants to former hud officials and the 
politically wellconnected so too congress should not earmark 
funding for housing projects the report said this practice by 
congress which circumvents objective criteria competition and 
merit should be ended it said 
the bulk of the report was approved unanimously by democratic 
and republican members of the panel that section supported the 
position of current hud secretary jack kemp who unsuccessfully 
opposed congressional earmarking of specific housing projects 
the focus of the panels final report was pierce hud secretary 
for all eight years of the reagan administration who is under 
investigation by courtappointed special prosecutor arlin adams 
meanwhile adams and his staff appeared before the special grand 
jury empaneled earlier this year to consider evidence in the case 
it was adams first appearance before the panel since it was 
convened investigators carried large charts into the grand jury 
room 
the congressional report left unanswered whether pierce broke 
any federal laws or committed perjury in his sworn testimony to the 
subcommittee last year saying that was a question for adams to 
pursue 
but it said there was evidence that pierce and other hud 
officials misled congress and concealed the full nature and extent 
of abuses at the department as well as their own involvement 
at best secretary pierce was less than honest and misled the 
subcommittee about his involvement in abuses and favoritism in hud 
funding decisions the report said at worst secretary pierce 
knowingly lied and committed perjury during his testimony 
pierces attorney paul perito blasted the spurious 
allegations of the report 
it sounds like the last gasp of a politically oriented and 
motivated investigation that failed to uncover one piece of 
evidence supporting their suggested conclusion that secretary 
pierce benefited directly or indirectly perito said 
they may disagree with him on the way hud was managed that is 
not a violation of federal law 
pierce appeared before the investigative subcommittee in may 
1989 but later invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in refusing to submit to further questioning 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said pierce tried to 
distance himself from abuses and political favoritism at hud before 
the panel 
he stated that he never told these people to fund 
anything lantos said however sworn testimony from other 
witnesses and a paper trail of documents suggest that he was 
directly and intimately involved in the abuses and favoritism in 
hud funding decisions 
the report said the section 8 moderate rehabilitation program 
which provided grants to private developers to renovate housing for 
the poor became a cash cow which was milked by former hud 
officials and the politically wellconnected 
among the consultants who collected fees for helping obtain 
grants for developers was former interior secretary james watt 
abuses in that program alone could cost the government 413 
million in overpayments the report said while other hud problems 
will cost taxpayers more than 1 billion 
the report also cited a pattern of favoritism shown to pierces 
former new york law firm battle fowler jaffin and kheel 
including assistance to clients who were seeking moderate 
rehabilitation grants

with stab wounds was found in the tembisa black township near 
johannesburg police said 
factional fighting pitting zulus loyal to the conservative 
inkatha freedom party against xhosas and other blacks linked to the 
african national congress has killed about 800 people in townships 
near johannesburg since august 
the unrest spread from natal province where five years of 
warfare has killed 5000 people 
the government this week lifted emergency restrictions on 11 
johannesburgarea townships but ordered curfews and roadblacks in 
three townships outside cape town wracked by recent unrest 
law and order minister adriaan vlok ordered the curfews to begin 
thursday night in the townships of khayelitsha crossroads and 
lingulethu 
anc spokesman trevor manuel called it a highhanded bullyboy 
action likely to anger residents speaking from cape town he 
said violence would not end until town councilors in the townships 
step down 
many antiapartheid militants see the black councils as 
collaborators with the whiteled national government 
police reinforcements from pretoria were called in to enforce 
the 9 pmto4 am curfew after vlok declared the townships 
unrest areas 
officers set up barriers leading into the townships and searched 
cars as they entered

a weeklong sitin by smith college 
students protesting for a multicultural center ended today with 
students voting on a compromise 
were thrilled that weve reached an agreement it has been an 
exhausting process school spokeswoman debra bradley said 
under the agreement proposed thursday the administration will 
convert hampshire house a center for commuter students into a 
temporary home for cultural groups 
as many as 60 protesters had occupied the halls of smiths main 
administration building since oct 26 refusing to move until 
administrators came up with firm plans for a center that would 
serve the interests of minority and foreign students 
about 17 percent of the exclusive womens schools 2600 
students are nonwhite 
students had asked that another building lilly hall be turned 
into the multicultural center and although they were happy with the 
compromise they have not given up that goal said vivian chiang 
chairwoman of the asian students association 
most of us all are just so happy its over because were so 
tired but i can guarantee that theres still skepticism she 
said its a stopgap for this year i just want to make sure that 
the administration doesnt forget that its a stopgap 
although ballots were not expected to be completely tallied 
until days end chiang said the compromise had been accepted by 
leaders of all seven organizations 
a meeting was scheduled today between the students and a group 
of architects conducting a study on space reallocation at smith 
that school officials said could uncover a permanent home for the 
center 
currently only the black student alliance and nosotras a 
hispanic group have space in lilly hall both groups supported the 
protest 
administrators said turning all of lilly hall into a 
multicultural center was impossible because it would mean evicting 
the school of social work and the graduate office 
but administrators have promised to find a permanent home for 
the multicultural center 
the debate over a multicultural center has been raised 
periodically at smith since 1983 
protesters said the college seems more concerned about 
recruiting minority students than helping them once they arrive

prime minister margaret thatchers opponents had a 
field day today after her deputy sir geoffrey howe quit in 
protest of her resistance to britains integration into the 
european community 
instead of having a leader who holds the party together we 
have one who unfortunately allows the party to break up said 
exprime minister edward heath who himself was ousted by mrs 
thatcher as party leader in 1975 
publicly key aides in mrs thatchers 22member cabinet rallied 
round although they take a more conciliatory policy than the prime 
minister in the drive toward european union 
government sources said today that education secretary john 
macgregor had been chosen to replace howe as leader of the house of 
commons according to press association the domestic news agency 
it was not known whether anyone would assume howes additional 
title of deputy prime minister 
mrs thatcher her government in disarray and looking 
increasingly embattled was closeted at her 10 downing street 
office working on a couple of speeches for next week a 
spokeswoman said 
howes resignation late thursday prompted speculation that he or 
another senior lawmaker may try to oust her as leader of the 
conservative party and thus the premiership in a challenge this 
winter 
but many observers believe a leadership challenge would be too 
risky for the party now less than two years from the june 1992 
deadline for the next general election 
howe 63 a softspoken man who had come to irritate mrs 
thatcher profoundly according to political insiders handed his 
resignation to her without notice in a 30minute interview on 
thursday evening 
he cited a growing difference between them over britains 
role in europe we need to persuade friends as well as challenge 
opponents we should be in the business not of isolating 
ourselves unduly but of offering positive alternatives he said 
mrs thatcher responded that she did not believe their 
differences are nearly so great as you suggest and said she 
was saddened by his departure 
howe had stayed on as deputy prime minister after mrs thatcher 
removed him as foreign secretary against his will last year 
the end came for him when she lashed out after a european 
community summit in rome last weekend the leaders agreed 111 to 
set a timetable for monetary union and debated proposals for closer 
political ties 
mrs thatcher shouted no no no during a rowdy debate in 
the commons on tuesday and ducked an invitation to back howe 
londons financial times reported today that mrs thatcher had 
berated howe at thursday mornings regular cabinet meeting over his 
organization of parliamentary business 
howe was the last survivor of the 21member cabinet named by 
mrs thatcher when she first won power in 1979 his departure left 
her government in apparent disarray and the prime minister 
increasingly embattled 
mrs thatcher may tower over her party as she towers over all 
she surveys commented the prothatcher london newspaper the 
times but the tower is an evermore lonely one 
the truth is that the problem is not a cabinet minister here 
or a cabinet minister there said paddy ashdown leader of the 
small liberal democratic party the problem is the prime 
minister 
some commentators had predicted the howe resignation because of 
a growing divide in the party over europe the liberal newspaper 
the guardian today called his departure the final body blow to 
the thatcher government 
the split over europe has blown up with the thatcher government 
already in deep trouble for 16 months it has lagged behind the 
labor party in poll ratings and is now a daunting 16 points 
behind 
the governments unpopularity is mainly over high interest 
rates 109 percent inflation a new local government tax that has 
backfired and criticism of mrs thatchers rigorous style 
in 1986 two cabinet ministers quit in a dispute over whether a 
european or us consortium should rescue britains ailing westland 
helicopter company 
last october chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned 
over mrs thatchers stalling on linking the pound to other 
european currencies 
in july trade secretary nicholas ridley whose views were 
believed close to those of mrs thatcher was forced to quit after 
calling moves toward monetary union a german racket 
howe now reverts to being a rankandfile legislator joining 
the ranks of senior dissidents they include former defense 
secretary michael heseltine the most popular choice according to 
polls to succeed mrs thatcher he has also been obliquely 
criticizing her policy on europe

the boston herald today endorsed democratic 
candidate john silber for governor saying he can restore the 
publics lost faith in government 
john silber means change the newspaper said and change 
is what we need 
the herald said republican william welds posts as a former us 
attorney and justice department official have simply not prepared 
him for the compex job of running the commonwealth of 
massachusetts 
over the next four years the governorship of massachusetts is 
certainly no job for the faint of heart the heralds frontpage 
editorial said john silber is the right man for the job 
weld won the boston globes endorsement thursday 
the globe also praised silber who is on leave as president of 
boston university for his intelligence and competence in his 
professional field but faulted him for his tarttongued 
behavior and his intimidating tactics 
it said welds leadership style was more likely to get results 
the herald said silbers rapid rise in popularity is a 
reflection of the publics anger 
if john silber has captured the sense of public outrage he 
has also captured its sense that anything is possible if you work 
hard to make it happen

three police sergeants who were demoted for 
being overweight have been reinstated but ordered into a 
weightloss program the police commissioner said 
we looked into it and determined that it was better to have 
the people in a weightloss program and not tie it into their 
promotions commissioner willie l williams said 
officers stephen guckin joseph mcgoldrick and john harkins will 
still be required to lose weight but will not have to meet a 
deadline 
the three were promoted in april but demoted last month when a 
physical revealed they had not lost weight the action was taken 
because the three had signed agreements to lose the weight 
guckin was expected to lose 40 pounds but lost only 20 to 
remain at 260 mcgoldrick was supposed to lose 28 pounds but his 
weight remained stable at 291 harkins was expected to lose 100 
pounds but lost only two and weighs 313 
five other officers promoted under the same agreement either met 
their required goals or came close and were not disqualified 
all officers will be required to take a physical every two years 
and any officer found overweight will be assigned to a weightloss 
program announced williams and john shaw president of fraternal 
order of police lodge 5

the un high commissioner for refugees thorvald 
stoltenberg said today he is resigning less than a year into his 
fiveyear term to become norways foreign minister 
stoltenberg 59 who was foreign minister from 1987 to 1989 
said he was taking the change because it comes at a critical 
moment for norway 
his resignation after 10 months in office came as a shock to the 
agency which is facing its biggest refugee crisis ever and has 
been recovering from low staff morale under its previous 
leadership 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will nominate 
stoltenbergs successor there was no immediate indication who that 
would be 
the un high commission for refugees supervises programs for 15 
million refugees worldwide including 5 million afghans in iran and 
pakistan about 2 million in southern africa and the horn of 
africa and many in southeast asia 
the agency which won the nobel peace prize in 1954 and 1981 
has been in dire financial straits and last month approved an 
11percent cut in next years budget to 3455 million 
the un general assembly approved stoltenberg then norways 
un ambassador in new york as high commissioner on nov 20 
he was the only candidate nominated by perez de cuellar for the 
post which was vacated by jeanpierre hocke of switzerland under a 
cloud of suspicion and criticism hocke resigned over charges that 
he used a special education fund for refugees to upgrade his air 
travel to first class 
he was also criticized for alleged financial mismanagement and 
favoritism but he denied wrongdoing and nothing was proven 
stoltenberg is an attorney of international law and also served 
as norwegian defense minister 
he is a key adviser to prime ministerelect gro harlem 
brundtland and a respected and popular politician in norway 
refugee organizations in norway immediately criticized his move 
it is letting down the refugees and i must protest it 
strongly annette thommessen head the norwegian association of 
asylum seekers told the national news agency ntb

the title tells all 
oh kay is ok a modestly successful and often engaging 
adaptation of the 1926 george and ira gershwin musical which 
opened thursday at broadways richard rodgers theater 
that may not be enough for broadway where only the powerhouse 
not the pleasant survive producer david merrick most likely was 
hoping to repeat the success of his last show 42nd street the 
quintessential 1930s movie musical that director gower champion 
brought to life on stage 
in fact there are echoes of his production in this revival 
directed and choreographed by dan siretta who usually resides at 
the goodspeed opera house in connecticut the big dance finale in 
oh kay done to two virtually unknown gershwin songs show 
me the town and sleepless nights harks back to champions 
show 
a somewhat different version of oh kay was done at 
goodspeed several years ago sirettas production was adapted by 
james racheff from the original book by guy bolton and pg 
wodehouse 
what siretta and racheff have done is turn oh kay into an 
allblack musical transplanting the story of bootleggers and 
chorus cuties from long island to harlem 
the change does work and serves as an excuse to bring on three 
sensational dancers gregg burge kevin ramsey and stanley wayne 
mathis these men can move burge who does his signature high kick 
throughout the show can earn applause just by hopping across the 
stage 
ramsey leads the chorus in the musicals one big show stopper 
well more like a show finisher since it ends the first act a 
rousing religious revival version of clap yo hands and mathis 
swivels his way through fidgety feet with style 
sirettas energetic choreography has a show biz savvy just right 
for the spirited music hes never at a loss for a strut jump 
split charleston or a tap dance particularly a tap they pop up 
with regularity throughout the evening 
only when he is forced to deal with long stretches of dialogue 
does sirettas perpetual motion machine slow down 
the book shows its age despite racheffs tinkering the jokes 
are more than old these gags had whiskers the day they were 
written but that doesnt stop helmar augustus cooper who barrels 
through the role of bootlegger turned butler with a comic finesse 
that would have made the shows original funny man victor moore 
break out in giggles 
the fun falters when the action shifts to leading lady angela 
teek kay the title character needs to break your heart when she 
sings someone to watch over me the evenings best known song 
teek belts the blues out of it but the result is emotionally 
barren and unaffecting as for teeks acting she mugs more than 
emotes 
the musicals handsome curlyhaired playboy hero is played by 
brian mitchell with a johnny mathis croon mitchell gets to sing 
one of the shows oddities an unknown unpublished gershwin song 
called ask me again it shouldnt remain unknown for long 
the rest of the gershwin score remains as heavenly as ever 
including maybe do do do and dear little girl 
theres an honest emotion and sweet simplicity to ira gershwins 
lyrics that the years have not reduced to cliches and george 
gershwins melodies ranging from sassy to sentimental sound 
wonderful in arnold golands orchestrations 
the settings by kenneth foy underwhelm but then much of the 
action takes place in the playboys harlem living room to 
compensate the costumes by theoni aldredge are starspangled 
opulent with a heavy dose of sequins 
in the end the production is buoyed by that glorious gershwin 
music and those three fabulous dancers when they fly high so does 
the musical when they are offstage oh kay shows its age 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times this loose adaptation of the 
gershwins 1926 musical is a chintzy innocuous slab of stock that 
is likely to leave more than a few theatergoers shrugging their 
shoulders and asking didnt i doze through that a couple of 
summers ago in a barn 
linda winer newsday for anyone who has been pining for the 
thrill of dancing feet kicky old songs and plenty of bugle beads 
there is news on broadway for a change producer david merrick 
ailing and considered out of commission for much of the decade 
since 42nd street has roared back with an adaptation of oh 
kay that is both taut and easygoing and a lesson on how to

anecdotes and facts about the life of a former 
haitian slave whos being considered for sainthood so far have been 
easier to unearth than his bones 
before cardinal john oconnor turned the first shovelful of dirt 
thursday on whats thought to be the grave of pierre toussaint 
church and medical officials said they hoped to find a casket or a 
skeleton 
but three hours of digging at a manhattan cemetery produced only 
bits and pieces of bones that cannot yet be confirmed to belong to 
toussaint whose life drew the highest praise from oconnor as he 
blessed the grave during a brief ceremony 
it would be magnificent if it could eventually be determined 
that he deserves to be a saint oconnor told about 100 
spectators who were kept from the grave by police barricades on all 
saints day 
he was a very holy man i wish i were as holy as he the 
cardinal said at old st patricks church cemetery in the citys 
little italy section 
toussaint was buried there after his death in 1853 at age 87 
by midafternoon workmen had found part of a jaw with teeth that 
probably belonged to a man said dr victor tchertkoff acting 
chairman of the department of pathology at new york medical 
college 
he said it would be given to an anthropological pathologist for 
examination he said other small bones appeared to be from human 
ribs 
we were hoping for more of a person but we didnt get what we 
hoped for wait until tomorrow tomorrow is another day said 
tchertkoff 
for decades historians have been studying the life of 
toussaint whose last name means all saints 
court papers filed to get permission for exhumation called 
toussaint a model of charity he is considered the founder of 
catholic charities because he helped the needy for 66 years when no 
formal systems of assistance existed 
shortly after workers began digging thursday several children 
darted through the barricades to pocket fistfuls from the growing 
mound of earth as keepsakes 
the bones must be positively identified so that the vatican may 
distribute some of them or his personal items to haiti or prominent 
places of worship 
the examination of his remains is a preliminary step during the 
period of investigation and examination of his life the 
examination occurs before he is considered for beatification only 
an early step in the overall process which could take years 
church officials said it was likely that the remains of 
toussaint his wife and stepdaughter were buried in the grave in 
wooden coffins that would have disintegrated 
each shovelful of dirt was carefully combed for bones tiny 
pieces of pottery shells and animal bones also were found 
it could take days yet said joseph zwilling a church 
spokesman of the quest to find the remains 
toussaint was born a slave in haiti in 1766 and moved to new 
york with his owners family in 1787 he became one of the citys 
leading hairdressers and was allowed to keep some of his income 
when toussaints owner died leaving his wife and child 
impoverished toussaint secretly supported them for about 20 years 
the widow freed toussaint from slavery shortly before she died in 
1807 
the church is investigating two miracles attributed to 
toussaint the recovery of a young haitian with cancer who refused 
medical care and relied solely on prayers to toussaint and a miami 
womans claim he cured her breast cancer

aboard the fishing vessel judy b about 22 miles west of kiska 
island in the western aleutians 
hes in good shape excellent condition roberts said the

ii while crews circled above late thursday hargiss said 
he is a seattlebased pilot who was trying to complete a record 
aroundtheworld flight by landing only on water

a singleengine floatplane since charles lindbergh logged the trip 
decades ago the coast guard said 
casey had landed his plane on oceans and the lakes and rivers 
of 20 nations 
his aroundtheworld plan temporarily was stymied in anchorage 
during the summer when he was unable to gain travel clearances from

tamil rebels abandoned without a fight 
their stronghold on mannar island off sri lankas northwest coast 
military officials said friay 
two thousand government troops in amphibious landing craft moved 
in thursday supported by gunboats and air cover said the 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity but there was no 
sign of the rebels 
we feel the tamil terrorists bolted because the terrain of 
mannar island does not give any encouragement for guerrilla 
warfare one official said 
soldiers sweeping the island recovered a large number of 
abandoned vehicles including an ambulance but saw no guerrillas 
the officials said 
there was no word on the government landing from the liberation 
tigers for tamil eelam who maintain offices in paris and london 
the rebels have fought a sevenyear war for a homeland for the 
tamil minority in the north and east of sri lanka 
the tigers had established a stronghold on the island blowing 
up a causeway and cutting off access from the sri lankan mainland 
the island 140 miles northwest of colombo is the closest point to 
indias south coast 
about 60 percent of the islands 100000 residents are tamils 
mostly christians making a living from fishing the rest are 
moslems 
last week the tigers posted warnings to moslems telling them to 
leave the island or be killed moslem refugees claimed the rebels 
stripped them of all their valuables before forcing them off the 
island at gunpoint 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said 50000 moslem 
refugees had fled mannar and the northern jaffna peninsula the 
rebel stronghold 
moslems who make up 7 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
often have been victims of the ethnic war between the tamil 
minority and the sinhalese majority 
tamils make up 18 percent of the population sinhalese comprise 
75 percent and control the government and military 
more than 14000 people have died after tamil militia launched 
the separatist war in 1983

campaigning as head of george bushs presidential campaign says he 
has turned to the lord since being diagnosed with cancer 
i have found jesus christ its that simple hes made a 
difference and im glad ive found him while theres still time 
the republican national committee chairman said in an interview 
published friday in the state newspaper

conversion 
i dont hate anybody anymore for the first time in my life i 
dont hate somebody i have nothing but good feelings toward 
people its just no point in fighting and feuding he said 
atwater made rapist willie horton a household name and turned 
the pledge of allegiance into an attack on democratic candidate 
michael dukakis during the 1988 presidential campaign 
since i have been ill i have found more honest decent people 
who have gotten in touch with me that have held values that i 
never knew existed said atwater a south carolina native 
atwater said he has been making peace with former foes 
democrats and republicans he said he has written letters of 
repentance and asked people for forgiveness 
in a letter this summer to columbia attorney tom turnipseed

the jumper cables comment he made regarding turnipseeds shock 
treatment for depression

forget it there are a very few people i need to get square 
with and youre one of them atwater wrote

wounded woman was the mother of at least two of the children 
they all have the same last name and were trying to sort them 
all out hankins said ive been in this business for 28 years 
and this is as bad as ive seen 
two survivors of the attack said the man entered the home and 
argued with the occupants before pulling a knife and knocking down

democrat mike kopetski was just 707 votes 
away from upsetting incumbent rep denny smith in 1988 this year 
with an assist from the savings and loan crisis he may succeed 
smith is considered the most vulnerable house member in 
tuesdays elections according to roll call a capitol hill 
newspaper 
were the underdog but were bouncing back up the oregon 
republican said were in a very tight race 
a poll released friday appears to support smiths contention 
that tuesdays vote will be close 
kopetski was favored by 50 percent of those interviewed in a 
poll commissioned by the oregonian newspaper while smith was 
supported by 46 percent the margin of error was 4 percentage 
points 
thats a significant gain for kopetski who was chosen by 41 
percent of those interviewed in august while 47 percent favored 
smith the margin of error in that survey also was 4 percentage 
points 
kopetski is hammering away at smiths connections with several 
savings and loans contending there were improprieties with the 
lawmakers role 
smith a fiveterm incumbent denies any wrongdoing saying he 
only went to bat for sampl directors who were being hounded by 
federal regulators 
i dont have anything to hide smith said 
he was a director of the american federal savings and loan 
association in salem from 1977 to 1987 the thrift in danger of 
being seized by federal regulators merged with home federal 
savings and loan and smith was forced off the board 
people are just plain mad over the fact that congress and the 
bush administration have failed to aggressively go after people who 
still have the bucks from this national scandal kopetski said 
they know denny smith helped to create this scandal 
the house democratic campaign committee filed a complaint with 
the house ethics committee accusing smith of violating ethics rules 
by using his office for personal gain in dealings involving sampls 
smith called the filing a dirty trick instigated by kopetski 
and asked for quick handling of the complaint but house leaders 
decided there wasnt enough time to discuss it before congress 
adjourned oct 27 
on another issue smith accuses kopetski of cozying up to 
saddam hussein because the democrat questioned the us military 
deployment in the region after iraq invaded kuwait 
smith used radio ads with the voice of adolf hitler in the 
background to suggest that kopetski wanted to appease aggressors 
kopetski who served in the oregon house from 1985 to 1987 
calls that ridiculous and says smith has been waging a 
namecalling negative campaign in an attempt to divert attention 
from his own conduct involving sampls

three months after seizing kuwait iraqi 
president saddam hussein has what he always has wanted a place 
at the very center of power commanding world events with the 
entire worlds attention focused on him according to an expert 
on saddams behavior 
those who hope that saddam will retreat meekly from kuwait in 
the face of moralistic pronouncements from abroad wont find much 
comfort in the analysis of dr jerrold m post a george washington 
university expert on political psychology 
in pursuit of his messianic dreams there is no evidence he is 
constrained by conscience says post who during a long prior 
career in the us government founded the center for the analysis 
of personality and political behavior 
when there is an obstacle in his revolutionary path saddam 
eliminates it whether it is a previously loyal subordinate or a 
previously supportive country 
in pursuing his goals saddam uses aggression instrumentally 
he uses whatever force is necessary and will if he deems it 
expedient go to the extremes of violence including the use of 
weapons of mass destruction 
that view of a penchant for heavyhanded rule is substantiated 
by david korn who has written about saddams human rights 
performance for a rights monitoring group middle east watc 
political killings korn says have become a hallmark of the 
baath regime that saddam heads both korn and post have said that 
in 1982 saddams health minister was arrested after suggesting 
that saddam step down 
they said that after the ministers wife pleaded with saddam for 
permission to see him his body arrived at her doorstep in a sack 
chopped to pieces 
judging by the results post believes the politics of mass 
terror at home and abroad have served saddam well 
he clears his throat and the dow jones average drops 60 
points he smiles and it goes up 60 points says post 
post says the major influence on saddams life was a maternal 
uncle who imbued saddam with a hatred of foreigners and notions of 
arab nationalism the uncles world view was summed up in a 
pamphlet he wrote years ago three whom god should not have 
created persians jews and flies 
post praised president bushs handling of the persian gulf 
crisis and said he believes that saddam is prudent enough to 
realize when retreat might be his wisest course 
post points out that saddam showed flexibility last august when 
he returned 700 square miles of territory to iran after vowing he 
would never take such a step 
never is a short time when revolutionary pragmatism dictates 
important to remember in evaluating saddams vow never to 
relinquish kuwait post says

mechanical problems on an american airlines 
jumbo jet carrying 225 passengers forced an unscheduled stop on a 
flight from london to dallas but the plane landed safely at 
kennedy international airport 
the plane had a wing flap that would not contract and may have 
blown a tire on takeoff from londons gatwick airport said tim 
smith an airline spokesman in fort worth texas 
he said there were reports that the rubber or something from 
the tire dented a flap on the right wing the extended flap caused 
drag that used up extra fuel so the plane was diverted to kennedy 
as a precaution he said 
after circling kennedy to burn off fuel the plane landed safely 
about 130 pm est the plane had been scheduled to reach dallas 
at 350 pm est 
federal aviation administration spokeswoman joann sloan 
identified the plane as flight 51

diplomats said today that four more americans in iraq will 
probably be freed this weekend and the white house announced that 
president bush will visit americas troops in the persian gulf for 
thanksgiving 
iraqi officials meanwhile today allowed foreign reporters to 
interview hostages from the united states britain and japan 
with the iraqi officials standing nearby the captives said they 
eagerly want to go home but denied reports they are being 
mistreated 
i love freedom when i get out of this and go home ill go to 
the beaches and have a nice swim said a man who identified 
himself as clem j hell an educator from takoma park md 
baghdad has offered to allow hostage relatives to travel to iraq 
for the holidays and iraqi officials reacted angrily today to us 
and british efforts to discourage hostage families from accepting 
the offer 
in another development saudi sources said syria is to send more 
land troops to saudi arabia bringing its contribution to 15000 
soldiers and 300 tanks there had been fears that syria might 
withdraw from the multinational force against iraqover us arms 
shipments to israel 
the white house announced that bush will travel to saudi arabia 
to visit some of the tens of thousands of us troops who were sent 
to the middle east after iraq invaded kuwait and later annexed the 
oilrich emirate 
the white house said bush will also stop in egypt when he heads 
to the persian gulf region after a trip to paris for the nov 1921 
conference on security and cooperation in europe 
during a campaign in cincinnati earlier today president bush 
promised to drive saddam hussein from kuwait while at the same time 
holding out hope that the united states could bring its troops home 
without a shot being fired 
bush also told a gop rally saddam hussein must get out and 
he must get out totally and the legitimate rulers must be 
returned 
bush suggested thursday that in some forms of brutality the 
iraqi president had surpassed even hitler raising some eyebrows 
by comparing saddam to the man who ordered the extermination of 
millions of people in world war ii 
today marked the beginning of the fourth month of the persian 
gulf crisis which started when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
saddam refused to let foreigners leave both nations when the 
united nations retaliated by imposing a trade embargo on iraq and 
the united states began sending more than 200000 troops to the 
region 
in announcing plans to free four sick and elderly americans 
iraqi information minister latif jassim denied the captives were 
being treated badly 
a us official in baghdad today identified the four to be freed 
as randall trinh 49 of hacienda heights calif dr abdul kangi 
50 of glencoe a chicago suburb raymond gales a diplomat 
stationed in kuwait and now in baghdad and michael barnes 
trinh a vietnamese american is suffering from an acute ulcer 
and gales had unspecified medical problems the official said on 
condition he not be further identified 
no details were given on barnes and it was not known whether 
kangi was sick kangi and indian american was on a holy 
piligrimage when the crisis started 
the official iraqi news agency said the government was acting on 
a petition from the arabamerican reconciliation society 
diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the men 
would not leave baghad before saturday when government offices 
reopen and paperwork can be processed friday is the moslem 
sabbath 
thousands of foreigners including about 1000 americans remain 
in iraq and kuwait iraq has selectively freed hundreds of them 
the latest mass release was of about 300 french nationals this 
week 
iraq has said relatives of the hostages should come visit them 
over the holidays but western governments have responded 
skeptically and advised citizens not to travel to iraq 
the iraqi foreign ministry today criticized that reaction 
saying that the united states and britain have no respect for 
human values jassim said these governments are totally 
inhumane 
the british foreign office asked relatives not to go but 10 
wives of british hostages said they will fly to iraq next week to 
seek their husbands freedom other relatives welcomed iraqs offer 
to let them visit at christmas 
we know our husbands are suffering and we just want to go 
back and rescue them said dorothy goodwin leader of the group 
of wives 
on thursday jassim insisted that all the americans at sites 
have complete freedom 
they can watch tv read books and read newspapers they also 
enjoy the friendship of iraqi forces he said 
bush denounced the hostageholding on thursday and criticized 
saddam with his harshest accusations yet 
they have committed ourageous acts of barbarism bush said 
of saddams forces brutality i dont believe that adolf hitler 
ever participated in anything of that nature 
the brutality against innocent citizens will not be tolerated 
and will not stand he told an audience in burlington mass 
the remark about hitler surprised some people in the audience 
bush was asked later at his florida news conference whether his 
comparison might be overdrawn i dont think im overstating 
it he replied 
the president said he believed that hitler did not stake 
people out against military targets and he did indeed respect the 
legitimacy of the embassies

the prosecution rested its case today against a 
woman accused of illegally using a mens restroom at a 
countrywestern concert because the line was too long for the 
womens room 
defense attorney valorie wells davenport asked the judge to 
order an acquittal for her client and sister denise wells 
municipal judge francelia totty was considering the motion early 
this afternoon 
ms wells a 33yearold legal secretary is on trial on 
misdemeanor charges of violating a city ordinance 
the law bars members of one sex from using a public restroom 
designed for members of the opposite sex in a manner calculated to 
cause a disturbance she faces a maximum 200 fine if convicted 
ms davenport said the case has generated national attention 
because the issue is something thats touched all our lives 
its not a genderbased thing its common fairness she 
said thursday when attorneys seated a jury and began testimony 
ms davenport said ms wells used the mens room out of 
desperation because the womens room line was too long the 
attorney told her sister not to talk to the media and she called 
the prosecution a silly waste of taxpayer money 
quite frankly i always thought texas was big enough to come 
to a lady in distress and dismiss charges like these she said 
we have four brothers denise grew up using the mens room 
police officer daniel b ramsey testified thursday that he was 
working as a security guard july 7 at a concert at the summit by 
countrywestern star george strait when he saw ms wells coming out 
of a mens room stall 
she said in a voice that could be heard to the front of the 
restroom there i left the lid up just like yall like it 
ramsey said 
i think she was extremely embarrassed when she made that 
remark ms davenport said during a recess 
under crossexamination ramsey said there were 20 women in a 
line stretching into the hallway waiting to enter the womens room 
the line of people waiting to use the mens room did not reach past 
the door he said

the governments gauge of future economic 
health dropped 08 percent in september the second straight big 
decline and the third month without improvement the commerce 
department said friday many analysts said a national recession not 
only had arrived but was intensifying 
the recession has begun said lawrence a hunter an 
economist with the us chamber of commerce all indications are 
that the employment report will get worse before it gets better as 
more companies lay off workers and close production 
facilities 
were clearly in a recession and the data that we got today 
and the data we got this week all confirm that the recession is 
intensifying said elliott platt economic research director for 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette a new york securities dealer 
though the bush administration contends the economy is still 
growing and will continue to do so at least into the new year the 
question for many private analysts now is rather how long and 
severe the contraction will be 
in another report pointing toward a weak economy the labor 
department said friday that unemployment remained unchanged at 57 
percent in october but that there were big job losses across the 
economy 
in all nonfarm payrolls lost 70000 jobs due mainly to the 
slumping construction and manufacturing industries that report 
said 
the commerce department reported the 08 percent decline in its 
index of leading economic indicators following a 12 percent august 
drop for the package of forwardlooking statistics it blends such 
indicators as buyers confidence and orders for consumer goods 
three consecutive declines in the index is generally viewed as a 
strong although not infallible sign of an approaching 
recession 
you now have two months in a row of negative indicators with 
the likelihood that october also will be negative platt said 
the index was unchanged in july but augusts decline was the 
steepest since a 14 percent fall a month after the october 1987 
stock market crash although the index is designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance many economists 
agree with platt that the economy already is in a recession 
what we had was an economy that was gradually losing momentum 
sliding toward a recession then got hit with a series of 
adverse shocks including the persian gulf crisis which pushed it 
over the edge very abruptly said larry meyer senior economist 
with laurence h meyer amp associates a st louis economic 
forecasting firm 
thats one reason why were not getting the advance warning 
that we otherwise might have gotten he explained 
many analysts predicted the october index also will be down 
platt noted that declines already have been reported for three of 
the 11 indicators average workweek consumer confidence and 
business delivery times 
mark m zandi an economist with regional financial associates 
in west chester pa agreed the october index will be down 
fairly sizably and said the september report indicates the 
economy is in for a very severe contraction at least through 
1991 
other economists on the other hand contend a recession will be 
mild and the economy will pick up by the middle of next year 
nine of the forwardlooking indicators dragged the index under 
in september while one was unchanged and one improved 
peter radford of national westminster bancorp in new york said 
the report was discouraging because it was so widespread 
its as close as youre going to get to unanimity its right 
across all the sectors they are all pointing in the same 
direction said radford who predicted the index would probably 
show more of the same in october 
contributing to the september decline were lower stock prices a 
decrease in orders for consumer goods an increase in weekly 
unemployment claims a decline in building permits a drop in an 
index measuring consumer confidence a decrease in unfilled orders 
a lower money supply faster business delivery times and a decline 
in the price of raw materials 
the only positive contributor was an increase in orders for new 
plants and equipment the average workweek was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1433 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 an down 11 percent from its level a year ago

ethnic tensions exploded into violence in soviet 
moldavia today when armed moldavian nationalists and ethnic 
russians clashed east of the capital leaving at least six people 
dead and 30 wounded tass said 
the casualties occurred in fighting near a village outside 
dubossary a town of at least 10000 people to the northeast of the 
republics capital kishniev tass said quoting the dubossary 
deputy mayor alexander parajan 
a police officer also was wounded in a shootout in dubossary 
and at least 2000 workers have formed brigades to defend the 
towns residents according to tass the official soviet news 
agency 
dubossary is an area in eastern moldavia whose predominantly 
russian and ukrainian residents are opposed to moldavias secession 
drive from the soviet union they already have declared an 
autonomous republic in the heavily nonmoldavian areas along the 
dniester river 
their separatist fight intensified last week after another 
separatist group the gagauz minority in the southern corner of the 
republic declared autonomy and began holding elections for an 
independent government 
groups of ethnic russians and ukrainians reportedly helped 
defend the gagauz against brigades of moldavian nationalists trying 
to stop the secession drives both groups have accused moldavians 
of discriminating against the minorities during moldavias own 
independence drive from the soviet union 
the kremlin sent 500 to 800 interior ministry troops to the 
gagauz region to keep order last week 
todays violence came hours after the moldavian supreme soviet 
legislature declared a state of emergency in dubossary and the 
nearby towns of tiraspol and bendery it had imposed similar rules 
on the gagauz area last week 
the legislature also voted to form a new moldavian national 
guard separate from the national interior ministry troops and its 
regiments based in moldavia 
tass said the emergency rules were expanded following reports 
that armed units were approached the cities from kishniev 
parajan said he did not say who made up the units tass reported 
parajan told tass dubossary residents were preparing to protect 
their city he said people were blocking bridges over the dniester 
but gave no details 
we demand the introduction of soviet interior ministry troops 
instead of kishniev militia or volunteer units tass quoted 
parajan as saying 
gagauz representatives have been negotiating with a joint 
moldaviansoviet committee trying to resolve the standoff in the 
gagauz districts both sides agreed to pull back their defenders 
mostly youths reportedly armed with sticks and metal rods and to 
allow the security forces to establish a buffer 
there had been no reports of violence since wednesday when 
moldavians attacked the frontier with romania threatening to kill 
guards and their families unless soviet forces withdraw the 
militants gave up and no casualties were reported 
tass said today that the situation in the gagauz areas has 
nearly returned to normal with interior ministry troops remaining 
at the border but now letting people pass through 
industrial enterprises offices and schools are working 
normally road blocks have been removed tass reported

ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
suffered a stunning defeat at the ballot box because she didnt do 
her homework not because of largescale vote tampering analysts 
say 
ms bhuttos leftleaning pakistan peoples party was 
outmaneuvered in the oct 24 parliamentary election by the islamic 
democratic alliance a rightwing coalition backed by the people 
who count in pakistan the army and the bureaucracy 
for the 37yearold former prime minister the defeat was 
humiliating 
the peoples party and its three smaller allies won only 45 
seats in the 217member national assembly less than half the 
number they controlled in the last legislature 
most observers and opinion polls predicted a close race they 
also were astounded by the magnitude of the victory 
the energetic charismatic former prime minister attracted huge 
crowds throughout her campaign but that didnt translate into 
broad public support for her party or her former government which 
was dismissed aug 6 on charges of corruption and mismanagement 
ms bhutto blamed her defeat on largescale vote fraud a charge 
dismissed by her opponents and three separate and independent teams 
of observers 
while many pakistanis believe some rigging occurred they doubt 
it would have significantly altered the outcome in the end they 
say she still would have lost 
despite her repeated charges of an electoral coup detat 
ms bhutto and her party have yet to produce solid evidence to back 
up their claims and havent a clue how the balloting could have 
been rigged without notice 
the peoples party founded in the late 1960s by ms bhuttos 
father former prime minister zulfikar li bhutto once represented 
the most progressive political force in pakistan 
but ms bhutto largely ignored the party machinery once she took 
the oath in december 1988 as the first woman leader of a modern 
moslem nation she failed to see the modern wellorganized force 
moving into her path 
supporters say the party badly needs restructuring to challenge 
the alliance which is more in tune with the lower and middle 
classes than the landowning families that have led pakistan since 
its creation in 1947 
enough mileage has been made out of the propoor image that 
the party earned during the late 1960s political analyst khalid 
mahmud said there is a need to put some substance in the hollow 
rhetoric before the havenots lose all patience and give the ppp 
even bigger surprises 
since her dismissal three months ago ms bhutto has proved 
shes a tenacious fighter and most analysts believe its premature 
to say the spell that she has held over pakistan for more than a 
decade has been broken 
but critics and supporters alike say she will have to make 
drastic changes in her outlook and style if she wants to salvage 
her demoralized party 
she must descend from the pedestal and pursue alliances that 
could broaden her support base she must set aside past arrogance 
in dealing with the smaller parties especially those who fought 
along with the peoples party against dictatorship but were not 
deemed fit to share the spoils of victory mahmud said 
ms bhutto still faces the most serious challenge of her 
political career some of her opponents admit privately they are 
making a concerted effort to force her out of politics 
seven charges of mismanagement and abuse of power are pending 
against her before special onejudge tribunals and conviction on 
any one could bar her from political life for seven years 
but even some of her rightwing opponents say that would be bad 
for pakistan if country needs a stable government they said then 
it also needs a strong opposition

the curtain went up and the theater crowd came 
back for the reopening this week of sardis the venerable 
manhattan restaurant that has been host to broadways stars and 
stargazers since the days of prohibition 
if the new owner looks familiar well he was the old owner 
sardis is owned by a sardi again 75yearold vincent sardi 
grandson of the man who founded the 44th street eatery as a 
speakeasy in 1921 
vincent had sold the restaurant and retired to vermont four 
years ago the new owners ran into financial problems and sardis 
closed in july vincent who still had a stake in the restaurant 
decided to come out of retirement and run it himself 
its basically the old sardis you dont want to change it 
it worked before said sardi ive been to these new places 
lavish but very cold they spend millions and the places have no 
personality 
sardis has multiple personalities or at least caricatures of 
them sketches of broadway stars past and present still line the 
walls at 234 w 44th street where the restaurant sits opposite the 
shubert theater 
since july passersby were greeted at the front door by a sign 
which promised very soon i will reopen sardis the longest 
running show on broadway vincent sardi 
on thursday night he made good on that promise it was like old 
times at sardis the aftertheater crowd filled the place in an 
opening night party for david merricks new show oh kay 
all my old customers were here it was wonderful said 
sardi but the times didnt like the play 
its not the first time thats happened at sardis which was 
once a place for the citys elite to see and be seen john 
barrymore helen hayes and rex harrison were among those who 
frequented the restaurant in the days when the paparazzi monitored 
the front door nightly 
if you dont see at least a dozen of the celebrities 
caricatured on sardis walls it means theres been a strike at 
actors equity advised the book new york on 1000 a day 
food was not the attraction as critic mimi sheraton made clear 
in this 1982 review 
those who go to the restaurant to observe celebrities will 
rarely be disappointed those that go for good food that is well 
served will rarely be satisfied for reasons that remain a mystery 
food service and housekeeping at sardis leave almost everything 
to be desired 
people still packed the place 
while aiming to create the old ambiance sardi did spruce things 
up he sunk 500000 into improvements new carpet new paint 
reupholstered banquettes 
things were allowed to run down by the previous owners who ran 
into financial problems sardi said 
the restaurant opened to the general public friday with a 
healthy lunch crowd and a good number of dinner reservations sardi 
is aware its a rough market these days but hes hoping to restore 
his restaurant to its past glories 
its going to be tough but the name was not tarnished we had 
a terrific following and i hope theyll be back said sardi 
were happy to be back its going to be big time

palestinians staged a general strike friday to 
protest zionisms first major victory 73 years ago the balfour 
declaration which offered britains support for a jewish homeland 
in palestine 
israeli officials meanwhile defended israels treatment of 
palestinians following criticism by un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar but some opposition figures also expressed fears 
israel was becoming more isolated from the world community 
the strike called by the fundamentalist movement hamas or 
zeal closed shops and halted most public transport in arab east 
jerusalem and the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in jerusalem police blocked palestinians from the territories 
for a fourth week from entering the walled old city to attend the 
main moslem weekly prayers at the al aqsa mosque 
officials maintain the step is needed to prevent a repetition of 
the oct 8 riots on the temple mount that led to the death of 20 
palestinians in israeli gunfire and subsequent condemnation of 
israel by the un security council 
at al aqsa moslem preacher mohammed hussein recalled the 
balfour declaration of nov 2 1917 which conditioned britains 
support of a jewish homeland on the idea that the civil and 
religious rights of nonjews would not be harmed 
we have been deprived of our national rights and now there is 
no freedom to worship in our own mosque hussein told several 
thousand worshipers 
in the gaza strip soldiers shot and wounded eight palestinians 
including four who were hit when troops opened fire on stone 
throwers after noon prayers in gaza city arab reporters said 
in reaction to the latest un criticism of israel a spokesman 
for prime minister yitzhak shamir maintained that israel was 
doing everything to ensure the security of the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
if there is any lack of security it derives from the violent 
activities of the arabs against israelis and their own brethren 
spokesman yossi ahimeir told the daily davar 
shamir in an interview for his 75th birthday in the yedioth 
ahronoth defended his rejection of a security council resolution 
urging a un investigation of the temple mount deaths 
is is the intervention of the un in jerusalem i dont care 
what they want to investigate the wording of the security 
council resolution harms our security in jerusalem he said 
israel annexed arab east jerusalem after seizing the area in the 
1967 middle east war most western nations including the united 
states do not recognize israeli sovereignty there 
other officials seemed hesitant to react to perez de cuellars 
suggestion for an international conference how to protect the 
palestinians the foreign ministry scheduled a briefing on the 
latest un actions then canceled it after reporters had been 
waiting for almost an hour 
the daily haaretz quoted unnamed diplomats as saying they feared 
further israeli rejection of un moves on palestinians would erode 
israels support in the world community 
micha harish general secretary of the opposition labor party 
issued a statement rejecting perez de cuellars suggestion but 
criticizing shamir for refusing a un investigation of the temple 
mount deaths 
shamir is creating unnecessary conficts with the president of 
the united states and the rest of the nations of the world he 
said 
perez de cuellar made the suggestion of calling a meeting of 
signatory states to the 1949 geneva conventions in an 11page 
report compiled by the security council after the oct 8 killings 
he said the meeting should consider ways to protect palestinians 
since un pleas for israel to abide by the conventions on 
treatment of occupied people had been ineffective 
israels un mission rejected the comments as interference 
saying israel has sole control of the occupied territories 
israel maintains the geneva conventions do not apply in the west 
bank and gaza but that it follows the conventions humanitarian 
provisions 
however israel regularly uses punishments forbidden by the 
conventions such as deportations and demolition of palestinian 
homes the argument is that these actions have been deemed legal by 
the israeli supreme court

ill repeat it today ill repeat it tomorrow and ill repeat 
it the next day bush declared

prosecutors said friday they had stepped up their 
probe of erich honecker while a top official in bonn demanded a 
trial and conviction of the former east german communist leader 
honecker is confined to a soviet military hospital outside 
berlin while german officials wrestle with his fate 
prosecutors are trying to decide whether there is enough 
evidence to charge him with corruption and murder for the 
shoottokill orders aimed at wouldbe escapees about 200 people 
were killed trying to flee from east germanys hardline regime 
in an interview published in the weekly newspaper the european 
honecker was quoted as boldly predicting he will be seen to have 
been right in his leadership of the country 
i am not afraid of a show trial i consider all the charges so 
far brought by the prosecutors office untenable the 78yearold 
honecker added 
that caused immediate criticism in bonn 
legislator wolfgang boetsch said the interview showed honecker 
was demonstrating his mockery of the people and cynicism 
whoever is ready for interviews should also be ready to stand 
before justice to see whether he is guilty the member of the 
conservative christian social union told reporters 
honecker deposed a little more than a year ago reportedly had 
been in ill health but pictures taken shortly before the oct 3 
reunification of germany showed him looking fit and energetically 
walking through the woods near the hospital 
berlin prosecutors said on oct 19 that a lack of manpower had 
prevented them from making progress in their investigation of him 
sparking skepticism at a crowded news conference 
however prosecutors spokesman cornel christoffel said things 
had changed in the last two weeks 
they are concentrating the investigation on mielke and 
honecker christoffel said of the fivemember team erich mielke 
the former secret police boss is already in jail awaiting trial 
christoffel said the team will have to pore through 400 file 
folders in honeckers case before deciding whether to arrest him or 
bring him to court 
the spokesman said honeckers case was of top importance 
because of his prominent position within the communist party 
while the prosecutors office maintains its staunch 
independence there appeared to be growing pressure to bring 
honecker to justice 
the no 2 official in the innergerman relations ministry said 
honecker must be convicted for reasons of political health 
morality and atonement for the most serious human rights 
violations 
in addition to the shoottokill orders state secretary 
ottfried hennig also listed what he said was honeckers 
responsibility for 300000 politically motivated convictions 
whether he can be put in prison afterwards is a decision that 
is exclusively up to the doctors hennig told the berlin 
newspaper neue zeit 
despite the pressure to bring honecker to trial there are some 
germans who feel that it would be better to leave him alone rather 
than facing a heavily publicized courtroom drama

secretary of state james baker iii said friday 
that a us team would leave for israel soon to finalize the 
transfer of 400 million in housing guarantees for soviet jews 
officials said 
the decision to send the team conveyed by baker to israels 
new ambassador zalman shoval ends a prolonged dispute which 
contributed to already strained relations between the two 
countries 
the dispute concerned us demands that israel not use the 
guarantees to build homes in the predominantly arab part of 
jerusalem which the israelis captured from jordan in the 1967 
mideast war 
shoval made clear that although israel would not use us money 
to build homes in the eastern part of jerusalem it would use its 
own money to build wherever it wanted 
there are no two cities of jerusalem just as there are no two 
cities of berlin shoval told reporters 
israels arab neighbors are incensed at the growing number of 
jewish homes being built in what they regard as occupied territory 
israel annexed the land in 1967 but only a handful of countries 
recognize the move 
the bush administration has raised israels hackles several 
times in recent months by questioning israels right to the eastern 
part of the city an explosive issue that the reagan 
administration had refrained from raising 
but the question arose this year partly as a result of the 
rising tide of soviet jews being allowed to leave for israel under 
the newly liberalized emigration policies of president mikhail 
gorbachev 
after months of negotiations israeli foreign minister david 
levy wrote baker on oct 2 agreeing that the us housing 
guarantees would be used only to build homes for immigrants on 
lands israel controlled before 1967 
but several members of the israeli government including 
hardliners such as housing minister ariel sharon then backed off 
levys promise prompting fresh us doubts 
israel was then asked to reassure the united states which 
shoval did in messages to the state department earlier this week 
this paved the way for baker to instruct the team of experts 
from the agency for international development to leave for israel 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the group 
would leave soon although the date was not yet fixed 
shoval said the 400 million will only guarantee 50007000 
housing units whereas israel will need to build some 250000 homes 
in the next four to six years for the soviet immigrants 
israel will have to raise 20 billion to 30 billion dollars 
over the next few years to absorb as many as two million soviet 
jews expected over the next seven to eight years he said 
relations between israel and the united states have been 
severely strained since the start of the persian gulf crisis the 
united states has twice voted against israel at the united nations 
in connection with the killing of 21 palestinians on jerusalems 
temple mount during an oct 8 riot 
president bush has sent israeli prime minister three letters in 
the past 10 days regarding israels refusal to accept a un 
investigation of the killings officials said shamir has rejected 
bushs request that israel accept the team 
nonetheless shoval described the tone of bushs letters as 
cordial and warm bush even sent shamir a third letter friday 
he said congratulating him on his 75th birthday

next weeks election has nothing to do with 
the timing of the announcement that longawaited jetties will be 
built in the treacherous oregon inlet sen jesse helms said 
the announcement came thursday almost a week after a storm 
tossed a dredge through the herbert c bonner bridge knocking out 
a 370foot section and isolating hatteras island 
helms and gov jim martin said it was that accident not 
political motives that led opponents to reach an agreement on the 
jetties 
that got their attention helms said speaking of several 
federal agencies involved in the issue i think it brought them 
together and they agreed for the first time something needed to 
be done and should have een done earlier 
on thursday us transportation secretary samuel skinner 
presented a 25 million check to state secretary of transportation 
tommy harrelson to go toward rebuilding the bridges missing 
segment skinner said the check represents the federal governments 
80 percent share of the repair costs 
the presentation was made during a campaign news conference 
called by helms in greensboro helms a threeterm republican 
senator is in a close reelection race in tuesdays election 
against democrat harvey gantt 
a letter helms carried to the news conference from us interior 
secretary manuel lujan jr said permits for the construction of the 
jetties would be forthcoming in six to eight months 
the jetties will save the fishing industry of north carolina 
in that area helms said 
commercial fishing boats use oregon inlet to travel between the 
atlantic ocean and a seafood processing center in wanchese 
twentysix people have been killed in accidents in the inlet 
during the last 26 years martin said the jetties are designed to 
prevent the inlet from becoming clogged with sand 
fishermen environmentalists and politicians have fought for two 
decades over the jetties 
environmentalists fear the jetties would cause erosion of nearby 
outer banks beaches in the cape hatteras national seashore and the 
pea island national wildlife refuge 
the jetties agreement came after the army corps of engineers 
said it would give the us fish and wildlife service and the 
national park service which control land access on both the north 
and south sides of oregon inlet a voice in the projects design 
helms said 
earlier estimates were that the jetties would cost 115 million 
helms said but changes that make the design more environmentally 
sound also bring down the cost to 84 million he said 
preliminary plans call for onemile stone jetties to be built on 
each side of the inlet between bodie and hatteras islands on dare 
countys outer banks 
still the jetties have some opponents 
a duke university marine geology professor orrin pilkey said 
the jetties will cause even more erosion on the outer banks 
in the next few years we should see severe erosion 
downstream which is already happening pilkey said highway 12 
is on the brink of being lost with every storm

ousted prime minister benazir 
bhuttos supporters on friday rejected appeals to boycott 
parliament and grudgingly agreed to take their oaths 
ms bhuttos populist pakistan peoples party suffered a 
stunning defeat in the oct 24 national elections that brought a 
rightwing coalition to power 
she has accused her opponents of massive vote fraud although 
the claims have yet to be substantiated 
her fellow party members decision to take their seats saturday 
on the opposition bench in the national assembly gave ms bhuttos 
husband asif ali zardari a brief taste of freedom after 23 days 
in jail on kidnapping and extortion charges 
zardari was elected to the federal legislature from the lyari 
slum in the southern port city of karachi he was to be flown to 
the capital under armed escort early saturday to take his 
parliamentary oath 
zardari 38 has been blamed for much of ms bhuttos troubles 
since her government was ousted aug 6 on corruption charges he 
came under regular fire during her 20 months in power for allegedly 
demanding commissions on lucrative government contracts he has 
steadfastly denied any wrongdoing 
the conservative islamic democratic alliance a looseknit 
coalition of 18 parties united only in their contempt for ms 
bhutto will form pakistans fifth civilian government in 43 years 
nawaz sharif 41 will be the next prime minister he was the 
alliances unanimous choice for the post which will be decided by 
secret ballot in the national assembly the policymaking lower 
house of parliament however the vote is merely a formality 
its a distorted democracy but its better than nothing 
said iftikar gilaini a former law minister in ms bhuttos 
cabinet 
sharifs alliance swept the polls winning 105 seats in the 
217seat assembly he also claims the loyalty of another 40 seats 
controlled by independents and smaller parties ms bhuttos 
peoples party and three allied groups won only 45 seats 
we have to work to defeat them from within and from without 
gilaini said during a meeting of party members friday 
the 37yearold former prime minister called the meeting to plot 
a strategy to protest election results which included possibly 
boycotting the national assembly 
the more militant party workers favored either a boycott or 
street demonstrations to force new elections in at least 100 
constituencies where they allege mass rigging occurred 
its too late now for street demonstrations said one party 
worker who refused to be identified the momentum is lost 
national elections were called three years early after president 
ghulam ishaq khan used his constitutional powers to dismiss ms 
bhuttos government ishaq khan accused her government of 
widespread corruption ineptitude and confrontational politics

leave the island 
shapiro said he expected christian brandos trial to begin with 
jury selection as scheduled on monday

can happen shapiro said of the 32yearold defendant it just 
is a continuing chain of horrible events for both the brandos and 
the drollets

he said 
after the may 16 shooting of drollet at the brando compound in 
los angeles ms brando fled to tahiti where she recently gave 
birth to drollets child

including her account of moments after the shooting 
he christian told me its done i have killed him ms 
brando said he told me that it was necessary that i lie by

shot was the only shot 
shapiro said ms brando clearly is suffering from serious 
mental and emotional problems he said she gave authorities five 
different accounts of the shooting all varying in degrees and 
varying in peoples involvement

not been mentioned at all as being the cause of the death of dag 
he declined to identify the person 
marlon brando said his daughter has had emotional problems since 
drollet died the last time he accompanied his son to court he 
burst into tears when asked about his daughters condition

baseballs giants moved here 33 years ago 
because new york wouldnt build a ballpark and the team will be on 
the road south to santa clara county if voters there agree tuesday 
to pay for a new stadium 
the team has been unhappy with cold windblown candlestick park 
near downtown san francisco but the citys voters have rejected 
proposals to build a new stadium 
leaders in five cities in santa clara county 40 miles to the 
south stepped in with a plan to finance a stadium for the giants by 
raising utility taxes voters in those communities are faced with a 
complex web of ballot questions all of which must pass for the 
stadium to get the goahead 
if they build it we will come no question said corey 
busch vice president of the giants which would be renamed the 
santa clara giants we have never been happy with candlestick 
and neither have the fans 
baseball commissioner fay vincent has lent his support to the 
plan he has said the santa clara giants has a nice ring to it 
and the proposal would keep the team in the san francisco bay area 
voters in the five cities are being asked to approve a 1 percent 
utility tax to finance the proposed 153 million stadium 
measure g is the utility tax question on the ballots in santa 
clara san jose sunnyvale and milpitas if approved the tax would 
raise about 16 million a year 
those cities have agreed to become members of a joint powers 
authority that would operate the stadium the city of mountain view 
would become a member only if its voters approved a separate 
utility tax measure o 
even if those measures pass voters in san jose and santa clara 
also must approve two closely related measures 
san jose residents will decide whether to allow the city to 
participate in building a sports facility if measure h doesnt 
pass nearly half the utility tax proceeds would be lost 
essentially killing the deal 
santa clara voters will decide whether to allow use of 98 acres 
of cityowned land for the stadium 
its a very complicated set of ballot issues which will make 
it tough for some voters to follow said art troyer a santa 
clara county official who would become the interim director of the 
stadium authority we think its going to be a close vote for 
that reason and because people just dont want to pay more taxes 
for anything 
the proposed utility tax would cost the average resident 16 to 
18 a year for 12 to 14 years until stadium profits began to repay 
construction bonds 
the giants lease at the 64000seat candlestick park expires in 
1992 and the team hopes to occupy the proposed 45000seat santa 
clara stadium for the 1994 season 
giants owner bob lurie has said since the early 1980s that he 
wanted to leave candlestick which has narrow aisles bad weather 
and parking and access problems 
san francisco leaders tried unsuccessfully to get voters to 
approve a new downtown stadium most recently last year 
we have no choice but to look for another home especially 
with the rising costs and players salaries busch said the 
franchise cannot survive in candlestick park and if santa 
clara doesnt build us a stadium well go somewhere else

record

manslaughter and received a sixmonth deferred sentence 
police said hale fatally shot jesse elmer jones as the 
16yearold was driving away from the home of hales daughter on 
oct 16 the womans home had recently been burglarized 
the situation escalated into something that i had no control 
over hale said how something so unintentional can go so 
wrong i dont have the answer for it

radical students demanding the 
overthrow of president roh taewoo clashed with police friday 
while factional strife that has threatened to split the governing 
party showed signs of easing 
clashes erupted at 15 colleges and universities in seoul where 
bands of 300 to 500 students fought police with rocks and firebombs 
to mark the 60th anniversary on saturday of a 1930 student uprising 
against japanese colonial rule 
police fired tear gas to block students from marching into the 
streets following the antigovernment rallies the total number of 
students involved in fridays protests was estimated at 5000 
there were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries 
the students oppose calls within rohs party for a 
constitutional revision that would replace the countrys 
presidential system of government with a parliamentary one headed 
by a prime minister 
urging one another to emulate the 1930 uprising students at 
yonsei university chanted lets inherit the fighting spirit of 
our seniors and punish roh taewoo 
meanwhile mainstream groups within the governing party 
indicated friday they would withdraw their demands for a new form 
of government and seek to end the factional strife threatening 
rohs leadership 
it has become apparent that a constitutional revision for a 
parliamentary form of government is realistically impossible 
said a senior governing party official close to roh speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
his statement came after a minority faction of about 50 
legislators threatened to break away from the governing democratic 
liberal party 
rep kim dongyoung a spokesman for the minority faction 
expressed optimism friday that the dispute could be resolved by the 
weekend 
the infighting is basically a power struggle to determine which 
faction within the governing party will name the next presidential 
candidate in elections scheduled for 1992 
rohs group which controls more seats in parliament and has no 
clear presidential candidate prefers a parliamentary system 
because it would be better represented 
a crisis within the party erupted last week when seoul 
newspapers printed a memorandum showing a secret agreement between 
opposing factions to press for a parliamentary government 
it was the worst political crisis since early this year when roh 
joined two opposition leaders in forming a new governing coalition 
that controls more than twothirds of seats in the 299member 
national assembly 
the memo signed by roh and two former opposition leaders kim 
youngsam and kim jongpil called for a parliamentary system by 
next year 
roh and kim jongpil a former prime minister had been allied 
against kim youngsam who as party chairman has the no 2 post 
after roh 
the disclosure of the secret memo was especially damaging for 
kim youngsam who has repeatedly vowed to fight attempts to change 
the system of government 
since the disclosure kim youngsam has admitted to signing the 
memo but said he now realizes it is impossible to change the system 
of government without consent from the opposition camp 
kim controls 50 of the 218 governing party seats enough votes 
to block any constitutional revision in parliament 
a constitutional revision requires approval by twothirds of 
lawmakers before being referred to a national referendum

with the onset of cooler weather in the 
persian gulf us officials have been trying unsuccessfully for 
iraqi cooperation in supplying clothing and blankets to american 
hostages the state department said friday 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said officials assume that most of 
the more than 100 detained americans are illequipped to cope with 
dropping nighttime temperatures now dipping to the 50s 
we would be willing to provide the clothing and blankets if we 
knew that the supplies would go to the people that are being 
held she said 
so far she added the iraqi government hasnt been willing to 
guarantee that any supplies the united states provides would 
actually get to the hostages 
officials believe the condition of the detained hostages has 
been deteriorating secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday that some have been forced to sleep on verminridden 
concrete floors 
about 105 hostages are in detention most at military and 
industrial sites to deter a potential us military attack 
slightly fewer than 1000 americans are believed to be in iraq and 
kuwait 
on a related subject ms tutwiler said the administration has 
learned that representatives of the iraqi government are inviting 
members of hostage families and prominent american citizens to 
visit iraq 
iraq is cruelly dangling as the lure for these visits the 
possibility of obtaining the release of or having the chance to 
visit hostages held against international law she said 
saddam hussein is using americans and othe nationals as pawns 
in a cruel game he is heartlessly toying with the anguish of 
family members and the sympathies of all civilized people for the 
plight of the hostages 
she said the united states and other western governments 
discourage visits that the iraqis can exploit for propaganda 
purposes 
the government will not support political economic or other 
concessions to iraq in return for the release of hostages they hold 
in violation of international law she said 
on thursday ms tutwiler dismissed as cruel an iraqi offer 
to allow family members to make holiday visits to hostages in iraq 
and kuwait 
other officials said that despite the us embargo against iraq 
family members can legally go there for purposes of family 
reunification

a 19thcentury outhouse with weathered 
shingles and a rusty latch may not have been the site of many 
memorable moments but officials are making a museum of it 
nonetheless 
the freestanding threeseat outhouse no longer in use got an 
honorable mention from the connecticut trust for historic 
preservation at the state capitol during ceremonies wednesday to 
recognize restored historical landmarks 
it was chosen from among dozens of entries statewide including 
restored municipal buildings houses and barns 
its a rare and endangered building said christopher 
wigren project manager for the private nonprofit trust its 
part of the past that is rapidly disappearing 
the venerable privy belongs to the former ashford academy and 
apparently was built with the twostory schoolhouse in the 1830s 
the academy graduated its last class in 1949 and until the ashford 
historical society moved in it and the outhouse fell into 
disrepair 
the door of the dilapidated latrine was ripped off and was used 
to fill in for the missing roof and the floor was long gone brush 
had nearly devoured the entire building before restoration began 18 
months ago said lorraine s mcconnell president of the society 
after the society finishes restoring the academy which will not 
be until at least 1993 it plans to turn the schoolhouse and 
outhouse into a museum mcconnell said

police killed at least 12 hindus 
attempting to storm a disputed moslem mosque friday and more than 
40 others died in violence as the religious dispute spread across 
india to neighboring moslem countries 
ten consecutive days of clashes between majority hindus and 
minority moslems have left nearly 280 dead in india and at least 
three dead in predominately islamic bangladesh 
the unrest could also weaken prime minister vp singhs chances 
of surviving a nov 7 confidence vote singh lost his majority in 
parliament after hindus withdrew from the 11monthold coalition to 
protest government handling of the mosque dispute 
fundamentalist hindus seek to destroy the hilltop babri mosque 
and build a a hindu temple on the site in ayodhya 300 miles 
southeast of new delhi 
hindus say the 460yearold mosque was built on the foundation 
of an early temple marking the birthplace of rama the 
muchworshiped warrior god moslems dispute the history and say 
relinquishing the mosque would jeopardize hundreds of other moslem 
sites 
police have fired twice this week on hindus attempting to 
overrun the mosque on friday a top district official said 
witnesses estimate of 12 dead was nearer to the truth than 
reporters tally of 10 the official spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
doctors at a hospital in the nearby town of faizabad said they 
treated 64 injured people including 48 wounded by gunfire several 
policemen were also treated they said 
reporters saw three buses and several jeeps torched by the mob 
some homes were also burned 
at least 25 deaths were reported in related riots across the 
uttar pradesh state where the mosque is located the press trust 
of india news agency reported 
thirteen more died friday in the western state of gujarat the 
news agency said other deaths were reported from karnataka bihar 
rajasthan and andhra pradesh states 
at least 279 people have died in india in recent violence linked 
to the dispute police and news agencies report last year about 
900 people were killed when a hindu group first announced its 
intention to take over the site by force 
most of those killed near the mosque recently were hindus but 
authorities refuse to identify the faith of other victims out of 
fear of exacerbating tensions 
in bangladesh which has a hindu minority two people died 
friday of bullet wounds suffered during antihindu protest earlier 
this week in the capital of dhaka 
at least three people have been killed and 350 wounded in three 
days of rioting in dhaka and in 12 other cities two of those 
killed were moslems and the religion of the third victim was not 
immediately known 
in pakistan indias predominately islamic western neighbor 
several demonstrations were held to protest the violence and some 
islamic leaders called for larger promoslem rallies 
pakistans caretaker prime minister ghulam mustafa jatoi said 
the indian government was halfheartedly protecting moslem shrines 
it was the moral duty of the indian government to protect the 
places of worship of moslems jatoi said in a statemenet 
published in the pakistan times india which pleads herself the 
champion of secularism has failed to give protection to holy 
places of moslems 
but one of those injured friday near the mosque accused 
government forces of shooting needlessly 
two policemen dragged a man out of the house and shot him in 
the chest then they also shot two people who were crying over a 
dead body they were shot in the backsaid bhupendra singh 
rawat speaking from a hospital bed 
rawat a 24yearold insurance agent from new delhi said he was 
knocked down by a police officers bamboo club 
former indian deputy prime minister devi lal a key figure in 
efforts to replace singh said a government comprising all parties 
should be set up to defuse the crisis 
singh who lost his majority in parliament after the prohindu 
bharatiya janata party withdrew is expected to lose the 
noconfidence vote the prime minister is also beset by moves 
within his national front coalition for a new leader 
some newspapers and political commentators have called the 
ayodhya dispute the greatest threat to the countrys secularism 
since india gained independence in 1947 
indias 880 million people are 82 percent hindu and 12 percent 
moslem the others include sikhs christians and buddhists indias 
constitution pledges tolerance of all religions and secularism

restoring diplomatic ties severed more than 40 years ago the 
foreign office said friday

vessels struck mines and sank in the corfu channel near albanias 
coastalbania refused to pay compensation and britain impounded 
albanian gold held in the bank of england

end the foreign office spokesman said the idea has gradually 
emerged that links should be restored 
michael tait an assistant undersecretary in the foreign 
office will lead the british team in rome the spokesman said

the last bastion of stalinism 
under its previous leader enver hoxha it pursued a policy of 
increasing diplomatic isolation 
however under ramiz alia who became party leader and head of 
state in april 1985 albania slowly has been moving out of its 
isolation and has restored diplomatic relations with dozens of 
countries

jogger was crossexamined friday for the first time since she was 
gangraped and nearly beaten to death 
one defense lawyer refused to question her but the other asked 
about her sex life her job competence her physical condition her 
memory and whether she had been assaulted by the men in her life 
many of his questions were not answered because the 
prosecutions objections were sustained 
the 30yearold woman who testified last summer at the trial of 
three attackers approached the witness stand with an unsteady gait 
and nearly stumbled as she climbed to the box 
with her blond hair cut in a short pageboy and combed back from 
her face a scar twisting from her left eyebrow to her rebuilt left 
cheekbone was visible during questioning by assistant district 
attorney elizabeth lederer the woman described her 
hospitalization her rehabilitation and the lingering effects of 
the april 19 1989 battering 
she was found naked and near death and covered with mud and 
blood in the northern end of the park after being gangraped and 
beaten she had lost threefourths of her blood and her skull was 
broken in three places 
i have difficulty with balance she said i have double 
vision i still have no sense of smell she said she has to hold 
reading materials askew to focus on them her testimony was similar 
to what she said at the first trial 
six teenagers were indicted for the attack on the woman and two 
male joggers three were convicted of rape and assault in august 
but acquitted of attempted murder two are on trial now on the same 
charges in state court the sixth will be tried early next year 
colin moore lawyer for defendant kharey wise suggested during 
crossexamination that the womans injuries were less serious than 
the prosecution claimed that a man she knew might have attacked 
her and that the attack occurred earlier than police had said 
moore asked the witness to explain her job as a vice president 
in the corporate finance department at salomon bros an investment 
banking firm 
she did and in mild tones moore asked its fairly 
complicated work isnt it 
yes she replied 
and youre very competent 
i like to think so she said 
then moore asked about her physical activities apparently in an 
attempt to show she was not as badly injured as claimed 
do you still go jogging he asked 
yes as part of my rehabilitation 
how often do you jog 
five or six days a week she also said she spends a couple 
of hours a day in a gym several times a week 
he asked her about driving and she said she used to drive but 
no longer does 
moore attempted to question her about michael allen a former 
male roommate and an alleged platonic friend with whom she canceled 
a dinner date because of work the evening she was attacked 
he was a friend the lawyer asked 
yes the witness answered 
a very good friend moore asked 
what do you mean by a very good friend the witness asked 
were you intimate with him moore asked 
acting justice thomas galligan sustained lederers objection 
wise 18 and his codefendant kevin richardson 16 looked 
intently at the witness for much of her testimony 
when you were at metropolitan hospital do you remember 
calling the name of a boyfriend moore asked 
the judge sustained lederers objection 
do you remember saying certain things three or four days 
after admission to metropolitan moore persisted 
no i was still in a coma 
prior to april 19 did you have any altercation with kevin 
oreilly the defense lawyer asked referring to her steady 
boyfriend the objection to moores question was sustained 
prior to april 19 were you ever assaulted by any male 
friend 
the objection to that question also was sustained

the united nations high commissioner for refugees 
announced friday he is resigning after only 10 months of a 
fiveyear term and said he will become norways foreign minister 
thorvald stoltenbergs resignation came as a shock to the 
agency which is facing an unprecedented refugee crisis and has 
been recovering from low morale under its previous leadership 
stoltenberg 59 who was foreign minister from 1987 to 1989 
said in a statement he decided to resume the post because it was 
a critical moment for norway 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will nominate a 
successor but there was no immediate indication of whom it might 
be 
the un high commission for refugees supervises some 15 million 
refugees worldwide including 5 million afghans in iran and 
pakistan about 2 million in southern africa and the horn of africa 
and many in southeast asia 
the agency which won the nobel peace prize in 1954 and 1981 
has been in financial crisis and last month approved an 11 percent 
cut in next years annual budget to 3455 million 
in his statement stoltenberg said he was confident his 
resignation would not compromise the un agencys ability to help 
refugees he said the organization was on the right track in 
meeting challenges posed by a rapidly evolving international 
situation 
but refugee organizations in norway immediately criticized his 
move 
it is letting down the refugees and i must protest it 
strongly annette thommessen who heads the norwegian association 
of asylum seekers told the national news agency ntb 
stoltenberg has accepted an extremely important job she 
said adding that leaving was on the verge of being immoral and a 
catastrophe for the un 
the un general assembly approved stoltenberg then norways 
un ambassador in new york last november he took up the post at 
the start of january 
he was the only candidate nominated by perez de cuellar after 
jeanpierre hocke of switzerland left under a cloud of suspicion 
and criticism 
hocke resigned over charges he misused a special education fund 
for refugees to upgrade his air travel to first class he was also 
criticized for alleged financial mismanagement and favoritism but 
he denied wrongdoing and none was proven

a yale graduate wo said god ordered him 
to kill his mother brother and two other people was found innocent 
by reason of insanity friday 
judge miriam span ordered rolando marcelo to undergo further 
psychiatric examination to determine whether he is still dangerous 
span scheduled a dec 20 hearing to decide whether to commit

marcelo confessed that he fatally stabbed his mother anita 
marcelo 51 his brother raymond 20 his friend nelson paiva 
21 and neighbor mark dennis 36 
he also stabbed richard hartmann 38 and chased 38yearold 
robert maul with a knife during the memorial day 1989 rampage 
evidence during the twoday nonjury trial included marcelos 
statment that he was the second messiah and had to kill his 
mother and brother so they could be resurrected to a better life 
he told authorities he believed their dead bodies would be 
invisible like the ghostly ballplayers in the movie field of 
dreams which marcelo watched the night before the attack 
he said he chased the visiting paiva outside and stabbed him 
while neighbors watched because paiva had questioned him about 
blood on his clothes his eyeglasses and the kitchen floor he said 
then went after hartmann and maul who witnessed paivas killing 
this is pretty serious stuff testified dr irwin n perr a 
psychiatry professor at the university of medicine and dentistry of 
new jersey thats not the usual form of criminal behavior 
perr was one of several people who testified about marcelos 
mental state 
while most agreed that marcelo had symptoms of mental illness 
they could not pinpoint which one he suffered from 
marcelo earned a bachelors degree in economics from yale in 
1987 and was described as having an iq between 111 and 133 his 
last job was at chemical bank in new york city which he left in 
1988 after contracting epsteinbarr syndrome said union county 
assistant prosecutor david hancock 
perr is to evaluate marcelo when he is moved to trenton

attorney general dick thornburgh on friday 
ordered an administrative hearing to determine if two california 
newspapers should be given an antitrust exemption to form a joint 
operating agreement 
thornburgh rejected a recommendation from the justice 
departments antitrust division that he deny the application to 
form a joint operating agreement by the manteca bulletin and the 
manteca news both of manteca calif 
without a hearing it is not possible to determine whether the 
application should be approved or disapproved thornburgh said in 
an opinion 
a hearing is necessary to resolve material issues of fact 
relating to whether the news is a failing newspaper that would 
qualify it for the antitrust exemption under the newspaper 
preservation act thornburgh wrote 
the law allows two newspapers to form joint operating agreements 
with the approval of the attorney general if one of the 
publications is in probable danger of financial failure 
thornburgh said the hearing should determine whether the news 
which is published wednesdays and fridays by raymus development amp 
sales inc could have avoided its continuing losses through 
different management practices 
the hearing should also determine the accuracy of antitrust 
divisions conclusion that the overriding objective of the owner 
of the news for the past four years has been to reach the safety 
net of this proposed joa 
the antitrust division concluded in its aug 13 report that 
the applicants have decidedly failed to prove that the 
newspapers losses were incurred despite reasonable management 
practices or that these losses could not be avoided if the news 
were to operate on a more businesslike basis 
in a reply to the report the news said it is suffering 
irreversible losses and different management practices would not 
be the cure in the future 
thornburgh noted that a number of manteca residents had 
requested a hearing which the attorney general said should be held 
in that town 
the joint operating application was filed july 13 1988 by the 
news and the daily manteca bulletin which is owned by morris 
newspapers 
under such arrangements two competing newspapers merge their 
commercial and production facilities but maintain their own news 
staffs and produce separate editions

an interior department audit shows that some 
western farmers regularly doubledip into federal irrigation and 
crop subsidies 
the report by the departments office of inspector general said 
farmers in 1986 received bureau of reclamation water subsidies 
conservatively estimated at 66 million to irrigate lands that 
produced surplus crops 
at the same time the agriculture department paid the same 
farmers 379 million to limit surplus crop production 
for example we found that eight farms that produced surplus 
crops received over 21 million in irrigation subsidies while 
collecting about 45 million in various agriculture commodity 
program subsidies during the threeyear period from 1986 through 
1988 
the farmers received dual subsidies because interior and 
agriculture did not make concerted efforts to coordinate their 
programs said the report released to the press friday 
the audit did not specify exactly how many farmers may have 
gotten double subsidies 
interior auditors concluded the dual subsidies should be 
discontinued expeditiously and that changes be made to coordinate 
the two programs 
but the report said interior has not expressed general support 
for eliminating the dual subsidies and has not supported bills in 
congress that would do so 
department officials have expressed concern that eliminating 
the dual subsidy could create financial hardships for some farmers 
while not significantly reducing the cost of the nations overall 
farm subsidy program the report said 
the subsidies are derived from the use of water from huge bureau 
of reclamation projects which provide lowcost irrigation on about 
10 million acres of farmland in 17 western states 
farmers are subsidized by the bureau of reclamation selling them 
water for less than the full amount needed to recover the 
governments investment in the irrigation facilities 
in 1986 the report said those lands produced crops with a 
gross value of 75 billion including 121 million bushels of corn 
65 million bushels of wheat 47 million bushels of barley and 16 
million bales of cotton 
the question of using subsidized water to grow surplus crops has 
been examined a number of times over the years 
legislation to limit or eliminate the double subsidies has 
circulated in congress the house passed a bill that was weakened 
by the senate and never received final congressional approval

secretary of state james a baker iii revised 
his travel plans friday to add meetings in moscow next week on the 
persian gulf crisis with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
baker also scheduled a meeting in cairo on tuesday with chinese 
foreign minister qichen qian 
the sessions reflect an expanding us campaign to pressure iraq 
to end its threemonth occupation of kuwait the soviet union and 
china are permanent members of the un security council and their 
support would be essential for any tougher unbacked economic 
sanctions or military action 
baker is also going to the persian gulf to see leaders of 
bahrain saudi arabia and the ousted kuwaiti government to egypt 
and to turkey britain and france all within an eightday span 
he takes off saturday morning 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler described the 
purpose of bakers trip as consultation with our coalition 
partners over a full range of diplomatic economic and military 
matters 
baker on friday called in the new israeli ambassador zalman 
shoval for a 55minute session he is bypassing israel again on 
his travels baker said this week he wanted to avoid linking the 
arabisraeli dispute to the campaign to reverse iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
shoval told reporters the usisraeli relationship does not 
have to be emphasized every day 
the ambassador said he was confident baker would make a trip to 
israel soon and that his country shared with the united states an 
interest in promoting peace talks 
baker will fly to moscow from ankara turkey on wednesday and 
meet with gorbachev and shevardnadze on thursday and friday 
apart from the gulf situation baker will take up with the 
soviet foreign minister lingering technical issues in the landmark 
arms control treaty to be signed at a 34nation summit president 
bush is scheduled to attend in paris later this month the white 
house said friday that bush would continue on to the gulf to spend 
thanksgiving with us troops 
the conventional forces in europe treaty the most sweeping arms 
control accord in history would set limits on tanks antiaircraft 
artillery and various other categories of nonnuclear weapons from 
the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains of the soviet union 
bush speaking at a news conference in orlando fla thursday 
said the pending treaty was all but put to bed with the 
exception of one tiny technical matter hopefully its been 
resolved by now 
baker and shevardnadze will discuss the way the soviet union and 
its allies will divide nonnuclear arms allowed to the warsaw pact 
under the treaty 
also within the north atlantic treaty organization two us 
allies norway and turkey want to lower the ceilings of arms 
permitted the soviet union in the zone that includes the two 
countries 
the us officials and private arms control specialists who 
discussed the issues did not say the summit might be set back but 
they stressed the deadline is less than three weeks away 
the soviets have lost east germany as an ally hungary is 
teetering but remains in the warsaw pact with bulgaria 
czechoslovakia poland and romania 
as these countries grow more independent veering further away 
from moscow the likelihood of them using their weapons in a joint 
military action with the soviet union becomes remote 
and yet the united states has a tactical stake in how the 
warsaw pact resolves the issue as well as how the soviets 
distribute their permissible weapons within the zones in their own 
country 
baker and shevardnadze announced basic agreement on all 
outstanding issues in new york in early october but failed to 
conclude a ussoviet pact to curb longrange nuclear weapons

a minister in chancellor helmut kohls new 
allgerman cabinet said east germanys former communist party has 
assets of up to 200 billion a newspaper reported friday 
the figure is a hundred times bigger than the sum named by 
officials of the former communist party 
hansjoachim walther a member of the former east german 
parliament who was appointed as a ministerwithoutportfolio in 
kohls cabinet after the germanys united on oct 3 made the 
remarks in an interview in the daily dresdner morgenpost 
the report follows the arrest of three former communist party 
officials who admitted to illegally funneling about 70 million in 
party funds to the soviet union 
two of the officials wolfgang pohl and wolfgang langnitschke 
were arrested last week and karlheinz kaufmann who was being 
sought on an international warrant was arrested on thursday in 
oslo norway 
kaufmann 42 was arrested when he went to a bank to discuss the 
transfer of 45 million from an account he controlled newspapers 
reported he is also suspected of transferring 21 million to a 
netherlands bank the oslo newspaper arbeiderbladet reported 
olso police spokesman svein olav kristiansen said kaufmann does 
not oppose extradition 
the party of democratic socialism built from the remnants of 
the east german communist party claimed the transfers were a debt 
repayment to the soviet communist party said norwegian reports 
walther head of the conservative german social union party was 
asked by the dresdner morgenpost to give his views on the wealth of 
the party 
i consider it possible they have holdings of between 200 
billion o 300 billion marks the equivalent of 133 billion to 
200 billion the newspaper quoted walther as saying 
the democratic socialists headed by gregor gysi are fighting 
to minimize the repercussions of the money scandal as germany 
approaches parliamentary elections on dec 2 
gysi has estimated the partys wealth at 13 billion and has 
promised a full disclosure of its holdings to clear up the scandal 
he has also denied prior knowledge about the money leaving the 
country 
in former east germany most property and businesses were owned 
by the state and run by the communists although the businesses 
were supposed to be turned over to a government trust the 
communists are widely suspected of spending their last days in 
power hiding and transferring the wealth 
at a parliament session in bonn on tuesday ingrid 
matthaeusmaier a prominent member of the leftist social 
democrats charged the democratic socialists had taken over the 
material worth of the old communist state without accepting 
responsibility for 40 years of injustice and a ruined economy 
also friday prosecutors probing former east german communist 
leader erich honecker said they had stepped up their investigation 
but honecker said he is not afraid of a trial 
prosecutors are trying to decide whether there is enough 
evidence to charge the 78yearold honecker with corruption and 
murder for the shoottokill orders aimed at wouldbe escapees 
about 200 people were killed trying to flee from east germanys 
hardline regime 
i am not afraid of a show trial i consider all the charges so 
far brought by the prosecutors office untenable honecker was 
quoted as saying in an interview published in the european 
newspaper 
german legislator wolfgang boetsch said honecker was 
demonstrating his mockery of the people and cynicism

us negotiators at international trade talks 
in geneva pushed friday to increase exports of american finished 
wood products by eliminating 1 billion worth of japanese tariffs 
a congressman said 
the direct talks with the japanese are part of a larger attempt 
to reduce tariffs worldwide in negotiations with the european 
community on the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
officials for the us trade representatives office told an 
aide to rep ron wyden dore on friday they are optimistic some 
kind of favorable agreement will be reached over the next month 
wyden said in a telephone interview from portland ore that 
the japanese essentially committed to tariff reductions during 
the super 301 talks this summer 
i think ultimately what we are saying is that the japanese 
have to live up to their end of the bargain this marketopening 
agreement struck with the japanese in effect said there are going 
to be substantial japanese tariff reductions he said 
we are talking about more than a billion dollars worth of 
sales and 40000 jobs this is absolutely critical to our region 
right now at a time the timber cut has gone down as a result of the 
decisions on the northern spotted owl i think that one of our big 
jobproducers can be assuring access to japanese markets 
us trade officials expect the japanese initially to resist the 
push toward tariff elimination but likely eventually will go along 
with some reductions as outlined in the super 301 agreements this 
summer wyden aide steve jenning said 
during those talks the japanese agreed to ease various fire 
building and inspection standards that are expected to boost us 
wood products exports by about 15 billion annually 
however the japanese said during super 301 talks they would not 
commit to specific tariff reductions until the gatt negotiations in 
geneva

brig gen mike myatt watched his 
game plan to counter an iraqi attack go awry in the desert of 
eastern saudi arabia but in the end the marines won the day 
and for the commander it was a good test of conditions his 
forces would confront in a real war 
you always say the plan is good until you have to execute it 
and then you have to change it the 49yearold infantry officer 
said with a wry laugh whatever we plan the enemys going to 
plan some variations 
the key he said is leaders at allng quickly to 
change 
and that is why the iraqis were defe levels respondiated in the simulated 
battle 
friday even if the marines didnt choose the battlefield 
for the past two months about 30000 marines commanded by myatt 
have been conducting war games in the desert with marines 
defending saudi arabia against a mock iraqi invasion 
during an exercise this week the general was out in a mobile 
light armored command vehicle racing across the undulating desert 
terrain at speeds up to 60 mph deploying his forces in response to 
ahe main communications problem myatt said is a blackout in 
parts of the desert between 9 am and 2 pm 
one way to compensate is sending up planes once a c130 was 
airborne over the exercise the command vehicles communications 
improved and its range expanded 
myatt who spent two tours in vietnam commands all marine 
ground and air forces in saudi arabia more than 10000 marines are 
also deployed in the northern arabian sea where they have been 
practicing amphibious assault landings 
the months of desert training he said have put the force in 
fighting shape 
i think we owe it to the mamas and the papas of all these 
marines out here to give them the best training that can be 
myatt said 
they ought to know the leaders in charge of their sons and 
daughters arent crazy and arent hoping for hostilities to break 
out he said but if we have to do it were prepared

ulysses adjusted its course toward 
jupiter on friday using a maneuver designed to increase the amount 
of time the spacecraft will spend studying the suns poles 
the probe ignited its thrusters to slightly change the course 
said franklin odonnell spokesman for the national aeronautics and 
space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
this is just to tweak the trajectory for the maximum amount of 
time over the suns poles he said 
the latest midcourse correction and four days of thruster 
firings that began oct 15 will add a week to the time the 250 
million ulysses spends orbiting the suns high latitudes during its 
fiveyear 750 million joint mission by nasa and the european 
space agency 
ulysses was launched from space shuttle discovery on oct 6 on 
feb 8 1992 the spacecraft will use jupiter as a gravity 
slingshot to leave the plane in which all the planets orbit the 
sun that will allow ulysses to fly almost over the suns south 
pole in 1994 and north pole in 1995 
odonnell said another trajectory maneuver may be needed in the 
weeks before ulysses whizzes around jupiter

whistlestop tour friday and democrat ann richards campaigned with 
us rep richard gephardt while two polls showed the 
gubernatorial slugfest tightening 
a masondixon opinion survey conducted for various media 
organiations put williams at 45 percent and richards at 43 percent 
a texas poll showed the race 4235 for williams 
the masondixon poll was based on interviews with 824 likely 
voters between monday and wednesday it had a margin of error of 
35 points since oct 11 that survey said williams support has 
fallen from 51 percent to 45 percent 
the texas poll conducted oct 1929 by the public policy 
resources laboratory of texas aampm university for hartehanks 
communications involved interviews with 622 likely voters it had 
a margin of error of 4 points 
with the election just four days away williams made seven stops 
during his railroad tour from san antonio to houston 
thanks for comin out today he shouted to a cheering crowd 
in luling 
luling texas a little bit of the oil patch i come from the 
oil patch when oil was 40 a barrel and texas was booming i was 
6feetfour williams said gesturing well above his head but 
now im all thats left 
williams began each stop introducing several members of his 
family then he would give a speech step off the train shake 
hands kiss babies and ask for votes 
between stops the train would speed past miles and miles of 
rural ranchland in luling bales of hay lined one part of the 
railroad tracks while a donkey stood nearby wearing a red blanket 
and visor that said we love claytie 
in longview richards raised the issue of intimidation of black 
voters and called again for williams to release his income tax 
returns 
you ought to be able to see whether or not someone who aspires 
to lead this state cares enough about government to pay his fair 
share in running the government she said 
before the rally richards was asked about allegations by 
democratic national leaders that republicans have been intimidating 
voters in east texas 
the democratic officials cited a newspaper ad warning of jail 
terms and fines for violating absentee voting regulations and said 
black voters who got mail ballots also received anonymous postcards 
threatening prosecution of those who gave a false reason for 
requesting a mail ballot 
gregg county republican chairman william osborne has defended 
the newspaper ad and said republicans had nothing to do with the 
postcards 
this is a repeated pattern richards charged ive been 
through a lot of elections where they attempted to do that it is 
so cynical that you would distort and attempt to take advantage of 
someones democratic right in this free society and keep them from

a new global pact that provides for 
seizure of drug traffickers bank accounts and property means 
there is no place for them to hide throughout the world us 
attorney general dick thornburgh said friday 
the accord also commits nations to extradite accused drug 
traffickers to the countries where they face charges 
it aims to hit the drug traffickers where it hurts the most 
that is to say in their freedom of movement and their liberty 
said margaret j anstee coordinator of all undrug control 
activities both she and thornburgh spoke about the new pact at a 
news conference at the united nations 
the new agreement known as the un convention against illicit 
traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances takes effect 
nov 11 
it binds the united states and 26 other nations that accepted it 
to cooperate in battling drug trafficking sixtytwo more nations 
and the european economic community have indicated they will adopt 
it 
nov 11 is a date that used to be observed worldwide as 
armistice day marking the end of the first world war thornburgh 
said nov 11 this year however is anything but an armistice 
day it is a worldwide declaration of war upon those engaged in 
illegal drug trafficking around the world 
the convention criminalizes each step of the drugtrafficking 
process from cultivation or production of precursor chemicals to 
laundering of profits 
among its major provisions 
all signatory nations agree to share criminal evidence and to 
extradite accused traffickers eliminating safe havens 
nations agree to adopt banking laws that allow them to seize 
drug profits and banking records 
the manufacture and sale of chemicals needed to make drugs is 
to be monitored in each nation 
shipments of illegal drugs are to be allowed to pass through 
countries so police agencies can trace them to their recipients a 
technique common in the united states but new in international law 
signatory nations will require commercial shipping airline 
and other transport companies to take steps to make sure their 
carriers are not used to carry drugs 
the convention is a determined statement by the international 
community that it will not tolerate the misery degradation and 
death being perpetrated by drug traffickers on a massive scale 
said anstee 
the accord was initially called for by 106 nations at an 
international conference in vienna austria in december 1988

parliament an additional 3000 protesters marched from central 
university square to government headquarters chanting demands that 
president ion iliescu resign 
the crowds dispersed peacefully later in the evening 
the protesters first assembled thursday evening after the 
government lifted price controls doubling or tripling the cost of 
some foods and other consumer items rents energy and certain 
basic food items were excluded from the price hikes 
demonstrators blocked traffic on nicolae balcescu boulevard a 
main thoroughfare they waved flags and banners protesting the 
price rises and shouted down with iliescu 
officials of alfa an umbrella organization of unions from heavy 
industries also demanded that the government privatize more than 
the 30 percent of stateowned companies it plans to sell as part of 
its reform package 
the government said friday it will compensate pensioners 
handicapped people and some groups of workers to help ease the 
price increase shock

about 5000 people gathered in a 
stadium friday for a group meditation to send good vibrations to 
the persian gulf and help avoid war there 
twenty minutes of medititation is kind of short to result in 
world peace but the event may result in some softening some 
kind of statement that is more reconciliatory said david 
ormejohnson a psychologist at the maharishi international 
university in fairfield iowa 
organizers from the swedish branch of transcendental meditation 
had hoped to fill the 15000seat globe stadium for the largest 
group meditation in history but about 5000 people bought 35 
tickets for the event about threefourths of those attending were 
experienced meditators 
a group in the netherlands in recent years brought together 
7000 people for a mass meditation 
organizers of fridays event said thousands of other people 
around the world also concentrated their energies during the 
20minute meditation 
transcendental meditation founder maharishi mahesh yogi 
delivered a message in a phone linkup from the netherlands i 
expect that we will very soon have irrevocable peace on earth he 
said 
czechoslovakias presidentwriter vaclav havel a meditation 
practitioner also sent a message the organizers said 
swedish lutherans and some other protestant churches objected to 
the event as we see it it is a covert way of spreading hinduism 
and we think people who practice it should be made aware of that 
said the rev dan salomonson of the philadelphia pentecostal church 
in stockholm 
transcendental meditation was introduced in europe and the 
united states in the 1960s individuals repeat a mantra or sacred 
word to achieve a relaxed physical and mental state in which some 
goal can be envisioned 
ormejohnson 49 implied that organized group meditation had 
led to a softening of saddam husseins martial stance since the 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
a meditation by 3000 people in iowa last month may have created 
a lull in the gulf crisis he said 
that was the time of saddams dream and of talk of troop 
reductions in kuwait he said referring to unconfirmed reports 
that iraqs president was told in a dream to leave kuwait

president corazon aquino said friday 
her government may reach outofcourt settlements with the family 
of late president ferdinand marcos in a number of civil lawsuits 
pending in us courts 
local newspapers reported the marcoses and a presidential 
commission were nearing an agreement whereby the government would 
get 60 percent of the funds deposited in five hong kong bank 
accounts by representatives of marcos 
the projected settlement does not entail dropping civil cases 
in the philippines but possibly civil suits in the us only if 
the amounts recovered are significant mrs aquino said in a 
statement criminal cases are not part of the settlement 
the marcoses face 33 civil suits in the philippines but have 
never been charged with a criminal offense because the government 
feared they would demand their right to return from exile in the 
united states to defend themselves 
marcos died in september 1989 in hawaii where he fled after his 
ouster in the 1986 popular uprising that propelled mrs aquino into 
the presidency 
imelda marcos was acquitted in july of criminal charges in new 
york city that she and her husband embezzled money from the 
philippines treasury and used it to buy four buildings in new york 
on thursday several leading manila newspapers reported that the 
marcos accounts were in the wing lung bank ltd standard chartered 
bank hang lung bank banque de lindochine and the hong kong and 
shanghai banking corp 
david castro chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government was quoted as saying that both the marcoses and the 
government do not know the exact amount held in the accounts 
we both realized that if we continue to litigate on marcos 
money held in trust by other people outside the countrywe could 
not expect immediate recovery within the time frame of the needs of 
our people castro said 
the government claims marcos looted billions of dollars from the 
national treasury during his 20year administration and deposited 
it in swiss banks or used it to buy real estate outside the 
country 
the money recovered from the marcoses would be used to fund the 
administrations agrarian reform program 
the government has filed civil suits against marcos in the 
southern district court of california the court has frozen all 
suspected marcos assets worldwide including the hong kong 
accounts but government lawyers reportedly will seek to exclude 
them

the supreme court on friday blocked some 
judicial elections scheduled for tuesday in louisiana 
the court by a 72 vote granted an emergency request by blacks 
in the state who said the elections would violate the federal 
voting rights act 
the court order barred elections for trial judges in 10 
districts and appeals court judges in two districts 
the blacks said the districts as well as the election date 
are invalid because they have not been approved by the justice 
department as required by the voting rights law 
some judges in the districts already were elected in an oct 6 
primary the blacks said they should be barred from taking office 
a threejudge federal court on oct 24 permitted the elections 
but warned candidates that winners would be removed from office if 
their districts did not receive federal approval within 90 days 
the threejudge court also approved holding any runoff elections 
if necessary on dec 8 
fridays high court order also suspends any runoff elections 
for the affected districts 
the bush administration sided with the blacks who challenged the 
judicial elections the justice department said permitting the 
elections would violate the voting rights act even though the 
judges only would be elected on a provisional basis 
the law requires louisiana and other southern states to submit 
any election changes for justice department approval 
the department said incumbent judges could remain in office 
until it has the chance to study the districts and decide whether 
the voting power of blacks has been reduced illegally 
justices byron r white and harry a blackmun dissented voting 
to permit the elections 
the case is clark vs roemer a327

new york state officials say that based on new 
and extensive evidence of wrongdoing by new york telephone the 
federal communications commission should reconsider a consent 
decree that ended its investigation of the new york and new england 
telephone companies 
in a filing scheduled for delivery monday to the fcc robert 
abrams the state attorney general and richard kessel executive 
director of the new york consumer protection board said new york 
telephones violations of commission rules on affiliate 
transactions was far more extensive and had a far greater effect 
on nyts rates than the commission believed when it adopted the 
consent decree 
a copy of the filing made available to the associated press on 
friday also said the fcc had not given an explanation for agreeing 
to the consent decree and that it had foreclosed participation by 
new york authorities into the investigation of the two nynex corp 
subsidiaries 
on oct 4 the fcc announced that the two telephone companies 
had agreed to make voluntary contributions totaling 14 million to 
the us treasury they also agreed to cut their longdistance 
rates 355 million to resolve allegations that they overcharged 
customers through a nynex subsidiary materiel enterprises co 
in exchange the fcc ended its investigation without finding any 
wrongdoing 
the fcc in february had said it intended to fine the two 
telephone companies 14 million a record amount over apparent 
violations of fcc rules governing transactions between regulated 
telephone companies and unregulated affiliates 
the fcc had ordered the companies to return 355 million to 
longdistance customers because of alleged 1185 million in 
overcharges to nyt and net by nynex materiel enterprises co 
meco an unregulated nynex purchasing subsidiary 
the companies agreed to the 355 million rebate to be made 
within 30 days and also said they would reduce their capital 
accounts by 326 million to remove the alleged excess profits on 
plant and equipment purchased from meco 
local phone rates were not be affected by the rebates 
a few days before the fcc consent decree new york state utility 
regulators authorized a study into whether nynex should be forced 
to divest new york telephone 
the new filing said evidence submitted during a rate increase 
proceeding show that fcc methodology vastly understates the 
unjust and unreasonable charges ultimately passed on to new york 
consumers in their interstate rates 
as a result new york longdistance ratepayers have paid rates 
inflated by nyts imprudent overpayments to meco and other nynex 
unregulated affiliates 
an fcc spokeswoman audrey spivack said the commission had not 
seen the filing and could not comment 
nynex spokesman peter goodale said by telephone from new york 
that he had not seen the filing and could not respond to specifics 
but he noted that the telephone companies already had taken steps 
to comply with th consent decree including making the 14 
million payment to the treasury 
weve upheld our end of the bargain and we hope the fcc does 
as well goodale said

iraq on friday permitted interviews with 
several american british and japanese hostages who said they 
eagerly want to go home and denied reports they were being 
mistreated 
the iraqi ministry of information took a group of baghdadbased 
reporters to different strategic sites to discount recent reports 
that foreign hostages are maltreated 
i love freedom when i get out of this and go home ill go to 
the beaches and have a nice swim said a man who identified 
himself as clem j hall an educator from takoma park md 
hall said he was in kuwait until sept 19 and was moved to a 
baghdad hotel before he and others were taken to vital economic and 
military installations in iraq 
he and nine other foreigners at a site about 60 miles north of 
baghdad said they received adequate food and denied any 
mistreatment by their unarmed guards 
officials insisted the exact location or the name of the site 
should not be mentioned 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 prompting a usdominated 
military buildup in saudi arabia iraqi officials responded to the 
buildup by refusing to allow westerners to leave the country 
they later allowed women and children to leave but took some 
600 western and japanese men to strategic sites as guests to 
try to prevent an attack on iraq 
in recent days there has been an escalation of claims in the 
west that the foreigners were being mistreated iraqi officials 
have denied the claims and said that all the foreigners were given 
adequate food and medical treatment 
information minister latif jassim said president bush was using 
claims of mistreatment as a pretext for an attack on iraq 
the visits on friday were meant to demonstrate that the hostages 
are well treated 
the food is decent i eat well and im treated well said a 
second american charles keegan 56 an investment strategist who 
worked three years for the kuwaiti investment co 
but keegan said he had been rounded up on sept 19 and had since 
been kept against his will 
keegans hometown was not available 
all 10 foreigners seen said they had been given good treatment 
but they disputed the wisdom of iraq holding them to deter war 
saying that neither bush nor british prime minister margaret 
thatcher would be deterred 
briton frank graham said mrs thatcher would fight a war despite 
the fact that hundreds of british citizens were taken hostage into 
a number of strategic sites in iraq 
if she wants to bomb she will bomb whether we are here or 
not said graham 49 who was working as an engineer more than 
four years for the kuwaiti minsitry of electricity and water 
the foreign hostages said they received messages from their 
families over the bbc and the voice of america radio 
the bbc messages keep us sane without them we could not have 
heard anything from them said leon corral 45 another british 
hostage 
iraqi officials at the site said that they arranged for the 
hostages to send and receive letters from their families and 
accused authorities in britain and the united states of blocking 
the mail 
the japanese hostages said they receive food and medical 
supplies from their embassy in baghdad and expressed hope that 
former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone might be able to 
release some of them when he visits baghdad over the weekend 
sercho saisso regional manager of japanese airways said he was 
arrested in kuwait and moved to baghdad with about 200 other 
japanese who have been relocated at different strategic sites 
saisso said his embassy sends japanese food for fellow nationals 
being held

that his republic may secede from czechoslovakia has postponed a 
visit to hungary because of ethnic tension at home a news agency

later the slovak governing coalitions interior minister anton 
andras resigned he left under pressure from slovak premier 
vladimir meciar who had accused his political rival of 
incompetene 
the state ctk news agency quoted frantisek miklosko president 
of the slovak parliament as announcing postponement of the trip to

hungary beginning friday

a judge is under investigation after 
admitting she secretly dated a police officer whom she later 
married while he was a key prosecution witness in a drug case she 
handled 
municipal judge irene takahashi said thursday she didnt reveal 
her affair with el cerrito officer michael ramirez but said she 
should have before presiding over an october 1989 preliminary 
hearing 
takahashi said she realized failure to disclose the relationship 
deprived alberto torrez and luis lozano of their constitutional 
right to a fair and impartial hearing 
the revelations came in an agreement takahashi reached with 
attorneys for the two men who are charged with selling cocaine 
takahashis attorney ephraim margolin said his client entered 
the agreement to avoid a lengthy inquiry into impropriety charges 
he said it was premature to discuss the impact her conduct would 
have on her career 
the commission on judicial performance is investigating 
takahashi said visiting judge julie conger of the berkeleyalbany 
municipal court who is now handling the drug case 
the original charges against the men were dismissed in april 
after defense attorney linda fullerton challenged the propriety of 
takahashi presiding over the preliminary hearing 
the case has been refiled and the defense is trying to have it 
thrown out a second time the defense maintains the district 
attorneys office should be disqualified for its handling of the 
first attempt to dismiss the case 
fullerton and deputy public defender oscar bobrow are charging 
government misconduct in the prosecutors failure to investigate 
whether takahashi and ramirez were dating at the time of the 
hearing 
deputy district attorney nancy georgiou said ramirez also is 
being investigated for misconduct for allegedly lying about when he 
and takahashi became involved 
the two were engaged in december 1989 and married in september 
ramirez initially told the district attorneys office and his 
supervisor that the affair began after the preliminary hearing he 
later admitted he was dating the judge at the time

switzerland on friday eported its 
first case of mad cow disease which has already killed thousands 
of britains cattle and prompted some countries to ban british 
beef 
the swiss economics ministry said it would ban exports of 
infected or suspicious beef only if more cases are found 
the first case was diagnosed friday in the brain of a cow from 
northwestern switzerland that was slaughtered in july officials 
said 
there is no evidence humans can catch the disease which is 
transmitted among animals through feed and excrement the statement 
said 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy as the disease is formally 
known attacks a cows brain and central nervous system leaving 
tissue spongy afflicted cattle foam at the mouth and cannot stand 
or walk normally 
infections in britain last summer led european community 
countries and other governments to ban imports of british cattle 
and beef some of the bans have since been lifted 
the disease is believed to have spread to the british cows when 
bones of sheep which are susceptible to a similar disease were 
ground as a supplement in cattle feed to curb the spread the 
british government in september banned the use of brain spinal 
cord and other cattle offal in animal feed and pet food 
the british government has said more than 18000 cattle died 
from the disease in the last four years

a federal appeals court said friday that the 
nuclear regulatory commission went too far in attempting to 
streamline the licensing of future atomic power plants 
the unanimous decision by the threejudge panel of the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit was a victory 
for antinuclear groups that had argued the nrcs streamlining 
amounted to the public not having adequate say in the licensing of 
such plants 
the court specifically said a onestep licensing scheme 
under the nrc regulations which would allow a power plant operator 
to get both a construction and operating permit as part of a single 
proceeding violated the atomic energy act 
the nrc issued its new licensing regulations last year as part 
of an attempt to simplify the licensing process and reduce 
uncertainties and delays for atomic plant operators the action 
immediately was challenged in court by the nuclear information and 
resource service and the union of concerned scientists 
its disappointing said nrc spokesman joe fouchard weve 
attempted to craft a rule which provides for early decision 
making 
fouchard said the commission would have to examine the court 
ruling more closely before deciding on a next step 
the court upheld some parts of the nrc regulation including 
early site approval and standardization of reactor design 
but it said that while some combining of the construction and 
operational permits may be allowed the commission must hold a 
second round of hearings after construction is complete before an 
operating permit can be issued 
under previous licensing procedures the commission held formal 
hearings on construction and then began the procedures again before 
issuing a permit for actual operation the streamlined regulations 
would not have required a second round of hearings 
the threejudge panel said the atomic energy act clearly 
requires the second round of formal hearings so the nrc may 
consider significant new information that comes to light during 
and after the construction phase 
the nuclear and electric power industries for years have 
campaigned for ways to speed up the licensing process for nuclear 
plants the process can easily take a dozen years or more under 
current procedures 
the courts decision makes clear that the nrc does not have 
the right to remove the public from the reactor licensing process 
by not having a second hearing after construction said michael 
mariotte executive director of the nuclear information and 
resource service 
robert pollard of the union of concerned scientists said the 
decision supports the argument that some issues cannot be resolved 
in a single hearing before construction of a reactor even begins 
the opinion was written by chief judge patricia wald the other 
two panel members were circuit judge david b sentelle and circuit 
judge clarence thomas

the revenge wasnt slick but it was sweet when 
texas voters broadcast their version of americas funniest home 
videos homemade parodies of the bitter gubernatorial race 
between clayton williams and ann richards 
for the last year texans have been bombarded with poll results 
slipups and milliondollar mudslinging during what some say is the 
nastiest race for the governors office in recent memory 
dallas public television station kera decided it wasnt going 
to take it anymore and turned its airwaves over to viewers for 30 
minutes this week in what they called voters revenge 
the program featured 12 of the best submitted homemade video 
parodies and skits of the gubernatorial race between richards the 
democrat and williams the republican 
in irwin arnsteins video the 31yearold computer programmer 
imitated williams during a campaign ad yes folks i plan to 
service texas arnstein said referring to williams admission to 
being serviced by prostitutes as a young boy 
if you elect me theres nothing for you to do but sit back and 
enjoy it the video continued referring to a comment williams 
made in march comparing bad weather and rape 
if its inevitable just relax and enjoy it williams told 
reporters 
in another video voters were asked to compare williams to an 
animal examples included rooster weasel jackass piranha and 
ostrich 
the recording quality resembled homemade 8mm movies nothing 
like that of ads run by richards and williams who have spent a 
recordbreaking 32 million on the campaign 
some ads were corny like a spoof sent in by alicia plaski 
featuring a rewritten clement c moores twas the night before 
christmas 
twas the week before the election and all through the state 
the voters were waiting for just one debate 
the voters were all snuggled al warm in their beds 
while visions of gas hikes danced in their heads 
most videos poked more fun at williams whose west texas bravado 
has resulted in several statements he later retracted 
but video directors say thats because theres more material 
well ann richards has done nothing to offend anybody whereas 
clayton william they had plenty of ammunition arnstein said 
it was like hitting the broad side of a barn with a two by 
four 
one segment titled hot talk featured controversial dallas 
disc jockey john ford of radio station kdge playing a sleazy talk 
show host 
in the video created by kdge intern jeff ballew ford 
interviewed the two candidates from hell 
the satan williams character played by ballew sported a 
cowboy hat and devils horns if elected he promised viewers a 
satan williams deluxe detention center and family theme park 
meanwhile a much younger looking satann richards capped in a 
large curly white wig told voters she once dated elvis 
ballew 28 and a sophomore at north lake community college says 
he last voted in a governors race but was unsure of the date 
another williams imitator joked that womens rights was a 
contradiction in terms his campaign promises included sending all 
teenagers caught smoking marijuana to hell 
since the program aired wednesday viewer response has been 
mostly positive said jonnie england kera spokeswoman about 
15 viewers complained at the satirical portraits of williams but 
others said they enjoyed the break from the usual election 
coverage 
it was not known whether the candidates were offended by the 
parodies 
i have no time to watch it said gordon hensley a williams 
spokesman 
margaret justus a spokeswoman for richards said we havent 
seen it because we dont have time to look at these things 
in one video a threepiece band called the tenner shoe river 
boys presented their version of the theme from the the beverly 
hillbillies show 
well the next thing you know ol clays a millionaire 
his kinfolks said hey clay austins over there 
now hes in the runnin with a lady democrat 
says ill be a gentleman and always tip my hat

a federal judges ruling that a state 
child abuse list fails to provide due process could result in 
compensation for more than 200000 people on the computerized 
registry a lawyer said friday 
this could turn into a fairly expensive proposition said 
ronald meyer an attorney for the florida teaching 
professionnational education association 
he filed a classaction lawsuit challenging parts of the florida 
abuse registry in april 
although the suit is still pending an order by us district 
judge maurice paul takes probably 90 percent of the plaintiffs 
claims and decides it in their favor meyer said 
but steve konicki spokesman for the state department of health 
and rehabilitative services said the agency was seriously 
considering appealing the sixpage order filed tuesday 
in the order paul said florida law does not provide any 
procedural safeguards or due process for people who are named in 
the 211000 indicated reports of abuse on the statewide 
registry 
the computer list was used for screening job applicants for day 
care centers camps nursing homes or other staterun centers that 
offered care for the young elderly or handicapped 
the list was compiled by reports often anonymous through 
hotlines and from others such as teachers who suspected child 
abuse after the health and rehabilitative services conducted an 
investigation it would deem the alleged abuse to be unfounded 
indicated which means theres a possibiltiy of abuse but no 
proof or confirmed 
some school administrators were listed for spanking students 
teachers parents and others who are named in an indicated 
report of abuse of either a child an elderly person or a disabled 
person have no way of appealing the judge noted their names are 
retained for seven years 
nobody should be on this meyer said this is america 
youre not guilty by suspicion you should either be proven guilty 
of wrongdoing in which case let hrs keep your name on a computer 
or your name should be cleared and not retained on any computer 
or anywhere else 
paul upheld the way the state handles confirmed cases of 
abuse a process that was changed by the legislature this year 
paul has yet to certify the lawsuit as a class action and the 
amount of damages that would be sought on behalf of the thousands 
of people named has not yet been calculated meyer said 
the hundreds of thousands of class members ought to be able to 
receive something as a sort of blanket compensation for what 
theyre going through meyer said 
he said the bulk of the 200000 people named in the indicated 
reports are probably parents but also lists teachers nursing home 
employee and day care workers

humorist andy rooney said friday he has tempered 
his commentary since being suspended from 60 minutes in one 
case shelving plans to criticize a gift to the united negro college 
fund because he didnt want to be branded a racist 
i have pulled back some the suspension was a chilling 
experience rooney said at a meeting of the associated press 
managing editors 
rooney whose humorous essays have closed cbstvs 60 
minutes programs for 12 years was suspended for three weeks 
without pay in february because of statements attributed to him in 
a magazine for gays rooney denied he made the comments 
the experience however caused rooney to decide against 
criticizing a 50 million gift to the college fund the march 
donation by publishing tycoon walter annenberg is the largest ever 
for black colleges 
rooney said he had planned to criticize the gift in his 
newspaper column as well as his television commentary but i 
pulled back because i was chilled i did not want to be known as a 
racist 
rooney said he still believes it is inconsistent to support 
allblack or allfemale institutions while criticizing their 
allwhite or allmale counterparts 
rooney said he had decided not to air the critique on the advice 
of 60 minutes correspondent ed bradley who is black and 
others including executives of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
he also decided against the critique because he was afraid of 
losing his audience 
like all of us i hold the hope that i would influence the 
world and you have to decide on the best way to do that he 
said you would lose every good affect you would have had 
rooney also criticized network television news operations 
the network news organizations are not what they were he 
said i feel badly about the people who left newspapers for 
television 
as an example rooney said news producers sent reporters off 
to stand in front of camels or minarets or temples to read 
words written in new york 
if anybodys looking for a reporter i think im ready to get 
out of tv he said 
im not comfortable being a famous person he said im 
rude and i dont want to be grabbed on the street by strangers 
seeking autographs

iraqi troops captured three french soldiers on a 
reconnaissance patrol this week near the saudi arabian border with 
iraq the defense ministry reported friday they were later freed 
the soldiers who were taken captive monday were turned over to 
the french embassy in baghdad iraqs capital the defense ministry 
said in a communique 
it was unclear whether the incident occurred inside iraqi 
territory or in saudi arabia 
a ministry spokesman said later friday that the soldiers face 
disciplinary measures for an act of carelessness which 
suggests the incident was on the iraqi side of the border 
the ministry initially reported the capture occurred northwest 
of hafar el batin a desert city in northeastern saudi arabia 
hafar el batin is about 5 miles inside saudi arabia attempts to 
reconcile the different locales were not immediately availing 
a french defense ministry source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the captured soldiers committed an error of 
exceeding their mission theres a lot of movement around the 
border right now and we dont know exactly what happened the 
commander who has opened the investigation believes they are 
responsible 
about 13000 french forces including foreign legionnaires are 
among the more than 200000 multinational troops assembled in the 
persian gulf region to face off against iraq which invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 iraq has about 430000 troops in kuwait and near the 
saudi border 
the iraqi patrol surprised the french soldiers who committed no 
hostile act the ministry said 
the three were taken to baghdad and turned over to the french 
charge daffaires the communique said 
other military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the trio was composed of one officer and two noncommissioned 
officers in an allterrain vehicle 
french forces are scattered around strategic crossroads near the 
saudiiraqi border the sources said but are under strict orders 
not to get too close to the frontier 
saudi military commanders who have overall authority over the 
multinational forces in their country are aware of the incident 
the ministry said 
the french army has opened an investigation of the incident and 
will draw all the consequences the communique said 
the name of the regiment that the soldiers came from was not 
disclosed 
the incident occurred the same day that an iraqi airways 
jetliner flew 262 french and 17 other western hostages to freedom 
in paris after nearly three months captivity in iraq and occupied 
kuwait

blacks and cubanamericans are at it again in this 
city where bad ethnic relations seldom get a rest 
this time blacks are outraged at the appointment of a cuban 
school superintendent in the nations fourth largest school 
district 
a 53yearold veteran black administrator who twice served as 
interim chief was passed over to promote 39yearold octavio 
visiedo dade county superintendent paul bell died of a heart 
attack oct 16 after eight months on the job 
some blacks reacted to the appointment by calling for a 
countywide boycott by black students and workers on election day 
hoping to draw attention to charges of inbred racism in the citys 
power structure 
miami is the selma ala of the 1990s said ray fauntroy 
head of the miamidade chapter of the southern christian leadership 
conference it deserves the negative publicity that it gets 
black leaders called friday for the black community to vote on 
election day some were afraid a black boycott might be 
misinterpreted as a call to stay away from the polls 
we know that tuesday nov 6 is dday for us said state 
sen carrie meek dmiami we want people to turn out in numbers 
like theyve never turned out 
the city had hoped to recover from the negative image of four 
race riots in the 1980s spurred by anger over police shootings 
the indignant blacks are looking to recall the five school board 
members who voted visiedo into the superintendents seat last week 
they say they will attempt to recall miami mayor xavier suarez 
and all four city commissioners for this summers official snub of 
nelson mandela after mandela made kind comments about fidel castro 
the mandela incident sparked a 4monthold boycott of miami hotels 
by some national black organizations 
visiedo a deputy administrator who has been with the school 
system for 17 years was selected over the black communitys first 
choice tee s greer hes a black educator with a doctorate who 
has been with the district for three decades twice as interim 
school chief 
although visiedo has less experience than greer school board 
members said he had impressed them in recent months he was 
overseeing the districts finance and business management 
operations including a 156 billion construction program 
considered a top priority in the district 
school board members praise greer as a competent 
wellcredentialed administrator but they cite the decisive style 
and dynamism visiedo displays despite his relative 
inexperience 
greer repeatedly has called for calm and is opposed to the 
boycott 
i know they hurt he said of the angry black community i 
would prefer they do something other than keep children out of 
school 
the decision was important for the school board in dade county 
where innovative schools have become a hallmark since the 
administration of joseph fernandez who is now school 
superintendent in new york city 
black leaders say greer was passed over on oct 24 because of 
his race and that visiedos appointment further tips the imbalance 
between cubans and blacks in positions of power 
dade county public school officials say 46 percent of their 
295000 students are hispanic 33 percent are black and 198 
percent are white 
his selection was purely political and racial said the rev 
richard dunn who headed up the black ministers call for the 
boycott 
dunn and the rev victor curry used their callin talk show on a 
blackoriented radio station to announce the boycott at least 
seven other prominent black ministers have joined said dunn 
we want to expose the blatant racism that persists here in 
dade county said dunn 
although greer and some black leaders say the boycott would only 
hurt the students others believe it it will serve as a badly 
needed civil rights lesson for black kids 
its more than symbolic were going to give them a lesson in 
life said dunn they did more damage to the children last week 
than were going to do to them in one day 
visiedo prefers to see the boycott movement as a display of 
affection for greer rather than an anticuban statement 
we inside the system perceive it as a display of concern and 
affection for a person who has served his community for many many 
years visiedo said i share the concerns of all educators in 
this county black white and hispanic that is that we want our 
kids in school

skeletal remains were found friday that were 
believed to be those of a former haitian slave under consideration 
for sainthood a medical examiner said 
im sure we have his body said dr millard j hyland chief 
medical examiner for westchester county 
roman catholic church officials hesitated to say whether two 
days of digging at a small cemetery in the little italy section of 
manhattan succeeded until the remains of two adults found in the 
grave of pierre toussaint can be studied 
they didnt come out of the ground in one piece hyland 
said 
no caskets were found in the grave which is believed to contain 
the bodies of toussaint his wife and his niece it is believed 
they were buried in wooden caskets which would have disintegrated 
toussaint was buried at old st patricks church cemetery after 
his death in 1853 at age 87 
as a preliminary part of the churchs inquiry into his life so 
that he can be considered for sainthood his skeletal remains were 
sought and will be moved to st patricks cathedral they 
eventually would be distributed in haiti and prominent churches if 
the church makes him a saint 
church leaders and doctors standing by the grave were 
disappointed thursday when only fragments of a few bones were 
found they were believed to be mostly animal bones 
on friday workers sometimes digging with their hands found 
two slightly overlapping skeletons 8 to 9 feet beneath the ground 
i was expecting nothing hyland said bones are sturdy but 
they dont last forever im surprised to find two intact 
skeletons 
he said the remains of one of the bodies was apparently that of 
a black person but the other could not immediately be determined 
he said he would wait for anthropologists and pathologists to 
determine the gender of each 
the remains were taken into old st patricks church where they 
will be assembled and studied in a process that will last weeks 
digging at the grave was essentially concluded church officials 
said 
monsignor robert oconnell said the skull of one of the bodies 
obviously belonged to an older person because the jaw bones and 
teeth were worn down and there were cavities in the teeth 
these are definitely not children he said 
toussaint was born a slave in haiti in 1766 and moved to new 
york with his owners family in 1787 after becoming a hairdresser 
he was allowed to keep some of his income and used it to support 
his owners wife and child for 20 years after his owner died 
the widow freed toussaint from slavery shortly before she died 
in 1807 
church officials have said they hope toussaint could be approved 
for sainthood by the time pope john paul ii visits haiti in 1992 to 
celebrate the 500th anniversary of the arrival of christopher 
columbus

the bush administration said friday it will 
raise the question of nuclear weapons with pakistans new 
government a question that forced suspension of american aid last 
month 
we expect to engage the new pakistani government early on in 
discussion of these issues said assistant secretary of state 
john kelly meanwhile we have complied with the law and 
suspended all military assistance and new economic aid to 
pakistan he told a congressional panel 
before aid can be granted each year the law requires the 
president to certify to congress each year that pakistan does not 
possess nuclear weapons in the fiscal year that began oct 1 the 
united states had planned 564 million for pakistan 
chairman stephen solarz dny opened the hearing of the 
asiapacific subcommittee he chairs for the house foreign affairs 
committee with a blunt warning that neither the administration 
nor congress is prepared to turn a blind eye toward mounting 
evidence that pakistan persists in its pursuit of nuclear 
weaponry 
unless the new government takes steps to prove that it does not 
have those arms american law is quite clear no further us 
assistance can flow to pakistan solarz added 
for uspakistani relations to improve he said pakistan must 
undertake a genuine commitment to democracy noninterference in 
the affairs of pakistans neighbors and a new willingness to 
address us nuclear concerns 
within this framework everything is possible but without it 
we will have reached a parting of the ways 
kelly said tension between india and pakistan has eased in 
recent months and the united states is ready to help the two 
neighbors develop confidencebuilding measures he said 
it would indeed be ironic if our success in reducing the arms 
race between the superpowers were offset by arms proliferation on 
the indian subcontinent 
the continuing review of pakistans nuclear program is part of 
such concern kelly said citing a us law the pressler 
amendment requiring the president to certify annually that 
pakistan does not possess a nuclear weapon he confirmed that lack 
of the certification when the new fiscal year started in october 
prompted suspension of aid for pakistan planned by the 
administration at 564 million for 1991 
kelly also said the united states intends to review all 
available information in meeting another condition attached by 
congress to pakistans aid that last months parliamentary 
election be certified as free and fair 
prime minister benazir bhuttos peoples party suffered a 
landslide defeat in the balloting and ms bhutto charged wholesale 
fraud 
the newly elected assembly and the next government to be formed 
by the victorious rightwing islamic democratic alliance under 
prime minister nawaz sharif may be installed saturday 
kelly said the administration accepts the preliminary finding of 
a usorganized international observer team that the election was 
generally fair but was marked by flaws and controversy that 
probably did not affect the outcome 
hard and fast evidence regarding massive fraud has yet to be 
documented and presented but the process of collecting data that 
would form the basis for such claims is now underway said 
kenneth wollack executive vice president of the international arm 
of the us democratic party which organized the 18nation 
observer team 
wollack testified that the teams preliminary report was not 
intended as a certification of the elections and the delegation 
was quite careful in avoiding statements that could be seen as 
suggesting such a conclusion

convicted of armed robbery eight years ago was to be settled for 
50000 under an agreement reached friday 
the greenville city council voted unanimously to settle the 
case which has haunted the east texas town for eight years 
the city contends that its actions never violated the rights 
of geter and the other plaintiffs said dianne callander city 
attorney but this situation has created to my 
understanding a schism in the community 
geter who is black was sentenced to life in prison in 1982 for 
the armed robbery of a kentucky fried chicken restaurant even 
though his coworkers at esystems a defense contractor testified 
he was at work that day 
an allwhite dallas county jury convicted geter and he served 18 
months before he was exonerated

millionaire republican 
gubernatorial candidate clayton williams said friday he didnt pay 
any income taxes in 1986 because of the poor economy 
williams who has refused repeated calls by his rival democrat 
ann richards to release his income tax returns made the remark in 
response to a reporters question 
yes ive paid lots of income tax lots lots he said 
ill tell you when i didnt pay any income tax was 1986 when our 
whole economy collapsed 
bill cryer richards press secretary said williams admission 
shows why williams has refused for months to make public his income 
tax returns 
absolutely its no wonder he didnt want to release his 
income tax returns cryer said adding that the richards 
campaign thinks williams now needs to make all his recent returns 
public as the democrat did months ago 
it is an absolute necessity now that we know whether or not 
this man who is one of the richest men in the united states 
paid any income taxes like the rest of us cryer said 
in 1986 i can understand he was going through some hard 
times but everybody in texas was and we all paid our taxes 
then cryer said 
he said richards 1986 return showed she paid 47343 in income 
taxes on earnings of 154000 that included her 68000 state 
salary capital gains 14000 in interest income and a divorce 
settlement 
williams admission came during a whistlestop train trip from 
san antonio to houston he pledged to boost the states economy 
veto any income tax and fight a war on drugs 
richards campaigning with missouri congressman richard gephardt 
in east texas accused republicans of trying to intimidate black 
voters and denounced the gop as cynical 
two new opinion polls meanwhile showed the race continuing to 
tighten as tuesdays election 
a masondixon poll conducted for various media outlets showed 
williams at 45 percent support and richards at 43 percent another 
poll showed the race at 42 percent for williams to 35 percent for 
richards 
earlier in longview richards called again for williams to 
release his income tax returns 
i want to know if he paid income tax she told about 200 
people gathered at the gregg county courthouse 
you ought to be able to see whether or not someone who aspires 
to lead this state cares enough about government to pay his fair 
share in running the government she said

american voters have been turned off by negative 
campaigns this election year former house speaker jim wright said 
friday 
wright said he was disturbed fewer americans vote in local 
state and national elections than people living in countries with 
less of a democratic history 
while about 90 percent of the potential voters in a country such 
as nicaragua will cast ballots only 50 percent of qualified 
american voters turn out here 
the negative campaigns have gotten out of hand wright said 
in a speech at the 56th annual convention of the associated press 
managing editors some people have been turned off and have tuned 
out and thats just a damn shame 
the gubernatorial race has been marked by negative television 
ads by republican candidate clayton williams and his democratic 
opponent ann richards 
wright said he recently asked richards why she didnt spend more 
time talking about positive issues he said richards told him she 
has talked about positive issues discussing prison reform 
education and more jobs for texans 
of course you dont know i because all you see or read in the 
paper is some negative thing that i said about clayton williams 
wright said richards told him 
wright also discussed what he said was another dangerous 
trend the rising cost of running for office the cost of 
campaigns has become obscene 
wright said that he started his first congressional campaign in 
1954 with 31000 of his own money with another 31000 in 
contributions he won the election 
if a young man came to me today with 31000 and asked my 
advice i would tell him that that wouldnt even be a start 
wright said i would tell him hed need about ten times that much 
and that he should expect to spend 20 times that much 
wright estimated the average cost to run for us senate in 1968 
was 600000 in 1988 the average rose to 17 million richards 
and williams have spent at least 32 million in the gubernatorial 
race he said 
many potentially good political candidates do not seek public 
office because they dont have enough money said wright he 
suggested establishing an enforceable campaign spending limit of 
500000 per candidate 
apme is comprised of managing editors and other news executives 
of the 1500 member newspapers of the ap the worlds largest news 
gathering organization

a top official opening faltering talks on 
overhauling global trade warned friday that the negotiations could 
collapse entirely 
while we still have everything to gain the risk of losing 
everything has never been so present declared arthur dunkel 
directorgeneral of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the uruguay round of talks held under gatts auspices are 
scheduled to conclude in a month with a ministerial meeting in 
brussels belgium 
the 100nation talks were launched in uruguay four years ago in 
an ambitious attempt to restructure world trade they are aimed at 
accords in 15 sectors with the goal of reducing protectionism and 
expanding trade by more than a trillion dollars 
however in his comments dunkel said progress has been 
alarmingly slow he said substantive talks on agriculture the most 
contentious issue of the discussions have not even begun 
dunkel also said negotiators are far apart on textiles banking 
and intellectual property rights like patents 
the negotiations are being slowed particularly by a deadlock in 
the 12nation european community over a plan to reduce agricultural 
subsidies by 30 percent 
the united states and the cairns group of farm exporting 
nations led by australia say 30 percent is not enough argentina 
has warned it will walk out of the talks if there is no 
satisfactory agreement on slashing farm subsidies 
some european nations including germany and france fear that 
cutting subsidies would hurt their domestic farmers

fastfood giant mcdonald corps decision to 
abandon foam packages wont put much of a dent in the plastics 
industry but it symbolizes americas growing discomfort with a 
throwaway society analysts said friday 
the clamshellstyle containers for big macs quarter pounders 
and other sandwiches served at mcdonalds 8000 restaurants 
nationwide account for less than 1 percent of the 5 billionplus 
market for polystyrene says the society of the plastics industry 
a washington trade group 
in itself this is not a major event george krug an 
industry analyst at oppenheimer amp co said but theres more to 
be seen from it people are going to be more conscious about their 
packaging materials and that is an important market for the 
plastics industry 
disposable foodservice packages represent roughly 20 percent of 
the total polystyrene market krug said besides foam sandwich 
boxes foodrelated polystyrene products include plastic cutlery as 
well as clear plastic goods like glasses 
polystyrene foam has been banned by several us cities that say 
it contributes to landfill problems by lingering for years before 
disintegrating the polystyrene production process also is 
suspected of harming the earths protective ozone level 
mcdonalds said thursday it will begin replacing foam sandwich 
containers with paper products within 60 days the companys main 
competitor burger king already uses lightweight paper boxes 
mcdonalds president edward rensi said the sandwich containers 
account for nearly 75 percent of the companys total foam use 
mcdonalds is still seeking suitable replacements for plastic 
cutlery and plastic coffee cups 
the immediate impact will be felt by the handful of mcdonalds 
suppliers which include amoco foam products co mobil corp 
jenpak and huntsman chemical 
containermaker dolco packaging corp of wenatchee wash 
expects business to drop more than 50 percent in the coming months 
with the loss of mcdonald as a customer 
brad gothberg a spokesman for irwin research and development 
inc a yakima washmaker of the machines that make the clamshell 
containers said he expects some impact he would not say how 
severe 
karl kamena a spokesman for dow chemical co a major plastics 
producer said he didnt think the mcdonalds move would have a 
ripple effect and he disputed the environmental threat posed by 
the product as have mcdonalds executives themselves 
people tend to forget that foam polystyrene is 95 percent 
air kamena said weve found a clever way of using air as a 
package 
kamena said the average american uses between three and four 
pounds of polystyrene each year the equivalent of up to 888 foam 
cups 
besides fastfood containers polystyrene is a main building 
block for egg cartons yogurt containers which are a combination 
of polystrene and rubber hard clear plastics like those that 
contain compact discs insulation toilet seats and stereo and 
television cabinets 
dart container corp a mason michbased company that operates 
four polystyrene reprocessing centers denounced mcdonalds for 
discouraging foam recycling calling the decision an 
environmental fumble 
dart chairman wa dart asserted that foam requires 30 percent 
less energy than the energy needed simply to process paper 
products he said foam production generates 46 percent less 
atmospheric emissions and contributes 42 percent fewer pollutants 
to americas waterways than paper production 
mcdonalds decision comes at a time when the plastics industry 
is about to boost capacity to produce the raw materials essential 
for making polystyrene krug said within the next two years 
global capacity is expected to expand by about 20 percent 
theres going to be a bloodbath in terms of overcapacity 
krug said thats not good from a supplyanddemand point of view 
for the plastics companies 
mcdonalds move he said whetted the appetite of consumer 
advocates who say they can make a difference by bringing public 
pressure on these people

described his opponent friday as an orangeheaded wasp 
gop candidate william weld brushed off the silber comment about 
his white anglosaxon protestant background 
that doesnt bother me at all that name weld said hes 
called me far worse 
silber made the remark about weld while urging reporters to 
examine the republicans public statements as closely as they 
examine his 
the media has a set of blinders on because they cant see 
the shockers when they come from an orangeheaded wasp he said 
later silber characterized the remark as simply a description 
of weld 
i think just as surely you can say the short wiry 
candidate or the onearmed candidate the candidate with the 
withered arm running for governor silber said i think that 
would be an adequate substitute for john silber 
meanwhile consumer advocate ralph nader came to boston to urge 
voters to vote against silber calling him an authoritarian 
personality 
nader said he was not recommending votes for weld but believed 
silbers personality made him unsuited to be governor 
do the voters of massachusetts whose forebearers threw out 
king george over 200 years ago now want to elect a king john 
nader asked 
michal regunberg a silber campaign spokeswoman called naders 
comment part of a deliberate smear tactic

for the first time in decades votes in 
the minnesota governors race will be cast on paper ballots that 
means results probably wont be known until wednesday morning 
on friday the secretary of states office directed the printing 
of supplementary paper ballots for the governors race the ballot 
was determined thursday when the minnesota supreme court ruled 
that joanell dyrstad and not sharon clark will be republican arne 
carlsons runningmate 
election judges arent thrilled about the prospect of counting 
the separate gubernatorial ballots into the wee hours on wednesday 
it will take an extra three or four hours predicted joan 
pelzer the ramsey county election supervisor we probably wont 
know the results in the governors race until 7 am the next 
morning 
the handcounting will delay results in other races including 
votes in the us senate contest and even minor city races 
because precincts are required to tally all votes before releasing 
any figures said elaine voss deputy secretary of state 
to further complicate matters supporters of former 
gubernatorial nominee jon grunseth who cast absentee votes for the 
excandidate will be scrambling on election day to pick another 
candidate 
grunseth dropped out of the race sunday amid allegations of 
sexual impropriety clark grunseths running mate had claimed she 
was entitled to remain the candidate for lieutenant governor but 
the supreme court ruled otherwise 
if voters have mailed absentee ballots and want to make another 
choice in the governors race they must go to their polling place 
before the election judges count absentee ballots voters who 
havent mailed their absentee ballots can return the ballots to 
their city clerk or county auditor and receive fresh ballots and 
when ready a supplementary gubernatorial ballot

the national mortgage bank of greece pleaded 
guilty friday to running a 700 million money laundering operation 
in the united states and agreed to pay 8 million in fines 
the bank and 12 of its top us executives were named in a 
28count federal indictment alleging violations of currency 
reporting laws operating a bank without a license and conspiring 
to defraud the internal revenue service since september 1985 
i believe with what the bank did we are guilty apostolos 
georgiakis a governor of the athensbased bank told us district 
judge raymond j dearie 
the bank agreed to pay 8 million he said speaking through an 
interpreter 
federal law enforcement officials say the defendants controlled 
the largest moneylaundering operation in us history which did 
not involve drug money 
us attorney andrew j maloney said the penalty was the 
largest moneylaundering fine ever collected in a nondrug related 
case 
most of the people named in the indictment have pleaded guilty 
or agreed to plead guilty to a single count in the indictment the 
individuals all greek citizens who worked in american branches of 
the bank face up to five years in prison and 250000 in fines 
when they are sentenced next year 
two defendants vasilis kretsas and kostas giziakis have fled 
the united states and remain fugitives maloney said 
the bank the second largest in greece had branches in new 
york the chicago area and the suburbs of boston and philadelphia 
the banks branches were not authorized to perform usual banking 
functions in the united states and were only to serve as a liaison 
between the banks customers in the united states and the parent 
bank in athens 
however the bank flagrantly violated those limitations and 
opened accounts accepted deposits and processed withdrawals for 
thousands of its customers 
depositors under the scheme brought cash frequently 
suitcases full to bank branches bank employees would then help 
change the cash into smaller checks or money orders at nearby 
american banks thus circumventing federal reporting laws on 
deposits of more than 10000 
the checks were then transferred to athens or deposited into 
bank accounts controlled by the national mortgage bank of greece 
the bank catered almost entirely to greekamericans and promoted 
secret deposits in the nited states assuring depositors the bank 
could get them money back from greece in three days without the irs 
learning of the unreported income

a woman who said she was desperate when she went 
to the mens room at a countrywestern concert was found innocent 
friday of illegally using the restroom 
jurors deliberated for 23 minutes before acquitting denise wells 
of violating a city ordinance that prohibits people from using 
restrooms intended for members of the opposite sex in a manner 
calculated to cause a disturbance 
she faced a maximum 200 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor 
ms wells 33 and her lawyer and sister valorie wells 
davenport laughed and hugged each other when the verdict was read 
im relieved im elated ms wells said the jurors told 
me you had us all the way 
testimony in the trial which began thursday ended earlier in 
the day 
ms wells testified that she saw the line outside the womens 
room at the july 7 concert by george strait was so long i felt i 
was in a situation where i had to be in a restroom i took the only 
option i felt was available 
the legal secretary said she covered her eyes and apologized to 
men already in the restroom at the summit a loud remark she made 
about leaving the toilet seat up was more of a nervous reaction 
than a cocky remark she said 
ms wells was arrested and removed from the concert for which 
she paid 125 to attend 
i was devastated i felt i was being harassed for doing 
something i felt i had no choice but to do i entered the mens 
room to go to the bathroom and thats all she testified 
earlier friday police officer steven andrews said he was not 
offended by ms wells presence in the mens room 
it didnt bother me one way or the other said andrews a 
vice officer for nearly two decades who was involved in ms wells 
arrest 
ms davenport said the state failed to prove she had no 
permission to enter the mens room and that she entered with the 
intent to raise a ruckus 
assistant city attorney karl rosette said he didnt think he 
needed the summit management to testify whether ms wells had 
permission 
ms davenport asked municipal court judge francelia totty to 
declare ms wells innocent but said she wanted her sister to rebut 
some of the testimony offered by police 
two police officers have testified ms wells left the stall in 
the mens room and announced there i left the lid up just like 
yall like it 
the defenses case focused on the lack of adequate facilities 
for women at such public places as the summit 
the case has made ms wells a celebrity of sorts her bathroom 
trip has been the subject of national news coverage and she has 
made appearances on the talk shows of johnny carson geraldo rivera 
and joan rivers 
on thursday officer daniel b ramsey said he was working as a 
security guard at the summit when he answered two mens complaints 
that women were in the mens room 
ramsey testified he removed three women from the mens room 
when he returned he saw ms wells coming out of a stall 
but unlike andrews ramsey a vice officer for 18 years said he 
was offended by the womens presence in the mens restroom 
under crossexamination ramsey said 20 women were in a line 
stretching into the hallway waiting to enter the womens room 
while the line of people waiting to use the mens room did not 
reach past the door 
ms davenport said her sister waited until intermission was over 
and again tried to use the womens room but the line was even 
longer then in desperation she followed a couple into the mens 
room while the other womans date cleared the way

their name may be silly but their music isnt 
the pet shop boys pride themselves on crafting witty often 
sardonic lyrics to go with the smooth synthesized electropop on 
such hits as west end girls and what have i done to deserve 
this 
we always used to think of dance music as rhythm just 
something you dance to says neil tennant one half of the 
british duo 
but theres no reason why you cant have lyrical content we 
try to have dance music thats kind of thoughtprovoking 
tennant and his partner chris lowe continue their musical and 
literary pursuits on their first full album in three years 
behavior 
the first single so hard is clubland readymade and 
already a hit in britain but the rest of the album is something of 
a departure softer loose and warmsounding 
the boys are still trying to lose the calculated contrived 
image they got after their 1986 hit opportunities which 
included the chorus ive got the brains youve got the looks 
lets make lots of money 
even though weve only ever written two or three satirical 
songs about fame it kind of casts a shadow over everything else 
you do says tennant the lyricist and generally the more 
loquacious of the two 
so the new album explores new territory like the russian 
revolution in my october symphony another song is based on a 
bon mot from zelda fitzgerald we were never bored because we 
were never boring she once said 
so hard is a true story about two of their london 
friends and the trouble they have staying together tennant says 
im always hoping youll be faithful but youre not i 
suppose he croons in his distinctive subdued style 
weve both given up smoking cause its fatal so whose 
matches are those 
in new york recently to shoot a video tennant 36 and lowe 
31 said they try to write songs that people their age can relate 
to 
were growing older says tennant tall and slight whose 
dark complexion and hair is accentuated by an allblack outfit 
ive always written lyrics from the point of view of someone 
whos 
old lowe interjects 
incredibly old tennant agrees as they both break out 
laughing 
lyrics are intentionally genderneutral to appeal to all sexes 
and sexual orientations we always liked a kind of mystery a 
fascination with sexual ambivalence tennant says 
making compromises is a recurring theme in pet shop boys music 
finding a compromise between what you really want and what youre 
really going to get tennant says 
lowe dressed like a teenager in a tshirt jeans and hightop 
sneakers adds its a pretty big compromise 
tennant and lowe met in 1981 in a london hifi shop began 
talking and realized they both were interested in synthesizers at 
the time tennant was working in book publishing and lowe was an 
architecture student 
they began writing their own songs because they hated playing 
other peoples music they took their name from two friends who 
actually worked in a pet shop and in 1985 had their first hit 
west end girls 
since then theyve sold more than 10 million albums and 
achieved what tennant called a mediumlevel of popularity 
theyre hoping their first us tour early next year will give them 
another boost 
they also snared photographer bruce weber famed for his 
erotically charged calvin klein ads to direct the video for 
being boring weber making his video debut is shooting on 
long island in keeping with the songs fitzgeraldgreat gatsby 
connection 
but whether they move up to superstar status or not the pet 
shop boys dont expect their music to ever change 
we always hope to produce a record that moves people in some 
way whether it moves them to dance or moves them to reflect on 
something in their own life or moves them to cry tennant says 
thats what it does to us when we made the record

neil young had just seen the movie 
spinal tap for the first time and his life took on new 
meaning 
thats my life my life is spinal tap said young 
reaching for the mornings first cup of coffee 
the 1984 mock documentary follows hapless rockers on tour their 
future imperiled by a rift with the bands cofounder young who 
turned 45 on nov 12 doesnt struggle like those lowrent 
musicians he was though estranged saying a few years ago he 
never would play again with longtime companions crazy horse 
but now young has recorded an album with the legendary bar band 
awestruck critics say ragged glory resurrects youngs 
spontaneous harddriving rock n roll that freewheeling sound 
was shelved at times in favor of youngs acoustic ballads and 
country rock on solo albums and collaborations with mynah birds 
buffalo springfield and crosby stills and nash 
young said the time was right to reunite with crazy horse any 
bad blood between him and the band is forgotten 
crazy horse is a band that im a part of said young 
wearing his standard uniform jeans tshirt tennis shoes ray 
bans and stubble i lead the band yeah but im just a member 
its like returning to your roots it brings me back to where i 
started 
two of youngs most popular and acclaimed albums 1975s 
tonights the night and 1979s rust never sleeps were 
recorded with crazy horse their first effort together was 1969s 
everybody knows this is nowhere their last was 1986s 
life 
crazy horses own new album is titled left for dead in part 
the band members say because young and others in the business 
abandoned them in ragged glory young is joined by crazy 
horses guitarist frank sampedro bassist billy talbot and drummer 
ralph molina 
it may be the best one ive ever done with them young said 
its even and thats a little peculiar theres not one song 
that really stands out 
last year young released what some considered the best album of 
1989 and perhaps of his career freedom young whos hardly 
given to flowery selfpromotion believes ragged glory is 
superior 
i was amazed at the success of freedom not because i didnt 
think it was good but i was surprised that its shortcomings were 
not mentioned more often young said 
and what were these shortcomings well ragged glory has 
what freedom doesnt have he said freedom was ok to 
listen to its got all the soft songs but in this album well 
lose all the people who like the soft songs 
indeed only one track on ragged glory days that used to 
be could be considered contemplative both lyrically and 
musically 
filled with longing reminiscences of the 60s psychedelic 
music fills the air peace and love live there still the 
melancholy song says that personal dreams are threatened by 
possessions and concessions 
i usually shy away from this kind of song young said a few 
days before setting off on another trip on his sailboat i was in 
the middle of the ocean on my boat halfway between here and there 
and had been there for about 10 days no airplanes no other boats 
no noise but i did see a couple of humpback whales the song came 
to me 
the album was recorded at youngs 2000acre ranch 
the band doesnt rehearse arranges on the spot and avoids 
rerecording takes to cover glitches or raw edges the album stands 
like a piece of unfinished furniture 
it doesnt matter how you get it as long as it sounds good in 
the end said bassist talbot people make music not the 
instruments its just us hanging out together 
on a whim the band recorded the rampb classic farmer john for 
the album even though young was the only one who knew how to play 
it that carefree approach carries over to youngs songwriting 
too 
i dont sit down and say ill play a g or something its 
mindless its the other way around from what most people think it 
comes to you and you grab it and then find out what it is 
young was born in toronto and received a ukulele as a christmas 
gift at age 13 he joined the squires in 1963 and met stephen 
stills soon thereafter he teamed with stills in buffalo 
springfield and crosby stills nash amp young 
throughout his career he has been irreverent his 1988 song 
this notes for you a critique of commercialism in the music 
business yielded a controversial and awardwinning video 
im the lost character in this place because i dont know 
where i fit young said the record company is building an 
image grooming you i have no idea what thats all about where do 
i fit with this

on tuesday as network polls troop to the 
voters nbcowned station kcnctv in denver will attempt an 
electionnight experiment that will allow viewers to vote a split 
ticket 
they can watch nbcs primetime schedule of matlock in 
the heat of the night and a onehour nbc news election night 
special on kcnc 
or they can tune to channel 20 independent station ktvd a uhf 
station and see three full hours of colorado election coverage 
gathered and reported by the news staff of kcnc 
the nbc station bought the time from the other station and both 
have been promoting the threehour electionnight show on ktvd 
i guess its as simple as trying to have it both ways says 
kcnc news director marv rockford he means pleasing those who 
consider electionnight coverage a crashing bore and those who 
cant get enough of it 
this splitticket approach which rockford says also is being 
tried by several other stations elsewhere in the nation has a 
basic goal 
it aims to avoid losing audiences to competitors who 
counterprogram against traditional local primetime election 
coverage with beefedup entertainment fare blockbuster movies and 
the like 
some may wail quite wrongly says rockford that kcnc is 
ducking its news responsibilities but not david bartlett 
president of the radiotelevision news directors association 
we think its a pretty good idea says bartlett whose 
organization claims 3600 members in broadcasting and cable you 
obviously have to treat it delicately its really a business 
consideration 
but from a journalistic standpoint the idea of offering the 
viewer an alternative a longform shortform pair of 
alternatives seems to be the highest execution of our craft and 
thats what we should be doing 
although kcnc is offering two hours of entertainment on election 
night were not going to ignore the elections on that station 
rockford emphasizes 
in addition to its election show on ktvd he says kcnc will air 
fiveminute election updates until 10 pm denver time when its 
fulltilt election coverage on the other station ends 
at that point the coverage will shift to kcnc preempting the 
tonight show and probably late night with david letterman 
the new twooutlet method of election night coverage tried on a 
cableonly basis during primary races in september by nbcs boston 
affiliate could prove an electronic wave of the future bartlett 
says 
he calls it a very elegant solution to this heretofore 
insoluble problem of how to make everybody happy the news 
junkies and those who dont want their entertainment bumped for a 
night of voting results and analyses thereof 
his opinion is seconded by everette c dennis executive 
director of the gannett center for media studies 
in a sense its probably a better compromise than trying to 
play the ratings game mixing entertainment with election coverage 
or losing a big proportion of the audience with only election 
coverage 
many in the industry will be watching the results of the 
experiment at kcnc a station that emphasizes news and plans to add 
a onehour morning news and information show in january that will 
air after today 
among them news director nancy valenta of nbcowned knbctv 
which serves los angeles the nations secondlargest television 
market that station also is strong on news 
valenta says its primetime election coverage will start with 
live updates during matlock then preempt both in the heat 
of the night and the nbc news special for knbcs own local state 
and national electionnight telecast 
but its coverage will be the traditional kind seen only on 
knbc 
still i think what denver is doing is new and revolutionary 
and certainly well be watching their results to see what comes of 
it she says and who knows if it proves to be successful it 
might happen somewhere else 
if it succeeds in denver says kcncs rockford well do it in 
the presidential election in 1992 and possibly in next years 
mayoral elections 
we dont know if itll workwhether the three hours of 
election returns on channel 20 will attract much of an audience 
he says 
but the point is the broadcasting industry is changing so 
much you have to try some of these experiments some different 
ways of doing things and unless you find some ways to change 
along with it youre going to be left in the dust 
 
elsewhere in television 
networks gird for elections too cbs nbc and abc will have 
primetime election specials tuesday anchored by dan rather tom 
brokaw and john chancellor and peter jennings and david brinkley 
respectively 
the nbc and abc efforts will last an hour that of cbs two 
hours with all continuing their coverage at 1130 pm eastern 
time 
with bernard shaw anchoring cable news network will start its 
coverage of the offyear election returns at 6 pm after he signs 
off at 1 am cnn will offer a 90minute wrapup that includes 
final results from the west coast

combining anemic puns with relevant 
statistics louis rukeyser the host of wall street week grins 
and winks his way into the homes of 10 million viewers every 
friday 
since 1970 rukeyser has demystified the jargon and gyrations of 
the economy his irreverant attitude toward the often stuffy 
subject has made his show one of the most popular halfhours on 
public television 
a 20th anniversary show with some of the programs best guests 
will air nov 16 from tavern on the green restaurant in new york a 
onehour retrospective will follow on monday nov 19 
the rakish rukeyser is one of the most durable tv personalities 
on the air rivaling veteran luminaries such as mr rogers johnny 
carson and julia child 
rukeyser is known for painful fits of prose once while 
answering a viewers letter on investing in a hairpiece 
manufacturer he said if all your money seems to be hair today 
and gone tomorrow well try to make it grow by giving you the bald 
facts on how to get your investments toupee 
after a market slump he considered changing the name of the 
show to wall street wake he often consoles viewers by telling 
them to remember that its only their money not their life 
we have in america a bad tendency that things have to be 
either serious or fun he said in an interview before taping the 
show at maryland public television in suburban baltimore whereas 
in real life this isnt true the teachers we all remember in high 
school and college were not the ones who put us to sleep i dont 
think any of us should apologize for not being dull 
nobody wants to come home on a friday to be educated first 
you have to pull them into the tent 
along the way rukeyser was dubbed by people magazine as the 
only sex symbol of the dismal science of economics the new 
york daily news identified him as the economic guru of the 
industry 
outside of the wall street journal rukeyser has been a 
pioneer in demonstrating the popular appeal of quality business 
journalism said media critic thomas rosenstiel of the los 
angeles times he is especially good at proving that this stuff 
can be interesting and useful without being deadly dull 
rukeyser 57 appears each week with three panelists chosen 
from a pool of money managers and financial analysts who question 
the guest of the week such as the chairman of the securities and 
exchange commission or noted economist john kenneth galbraith in 
addition technical analysts whom he calls elves vote on a weekly 
elves index that assesses the strength or weakness of the 
economy 
rukeyser doesnt make any predictions other than to say he is a 
longterm bull he constantly issues disclaimers on stock tips 
offered by guests of the show their recommendations often cause 
share prices to rise sharply the week after the show airs 
ralph acampora head of prudential baches technical analysis 
division and one of rukeysers elves credits him with starting 
business coverage on television 
when i started with prudential i told them i wanted a big 
chart room and a television acampora said they asked me why i 
wanted a tv and i told them mrs obrien sitting at home has the 
greatest information in the world 
that mythical viewer is watching business news on cnn and fnn 
and its all because of rukeyser acampora said 
a former foreign correspondent for abc and the baltimore sun 
rukeyser became the first economic commentator for a network in 
1968 with abc he moonlighted on the pbs show for three years 
before leaving abc complaining about television coverage of 
economics 
he still maintains economics is the most poorly covered area of 
american journalism 
the prevailing view is that the subject of economics is too 
dull and or too complicated to hold an audience larger than the 
capacity of your average telephone booth he said i think 
thats nonsense i think there is a hunger in the american public 
for clear believable understandable usable pocketbook 
information 
despite his bullish outlook he concedes the economy is 
currently looking bleak but is quick to remind anyone that he does 
not invest for shortterm profit 
punk anemic weak getting weaker the outlook for the next 
few months is soggy at best rukeyser said but even with 
minimal policy changes we can be on our way again by 1992 
rukeyser who writes a syndicated newspaper column gives 
lectures and has written two books is known for being tough on his 
panelists and guests he continually pleads with them to speak in 
english 
jargon is a very convenient shield for people not entirely 
sure of what they are saying he said 
rukeyser says he will continue doing the show as long as it is 
fun which it still is and as long as his audience still wants 
him 
or as he might put it his ratings stock remains bullish and the 
dividends rewarding so rally round the tube in confidence the guru 
will keep your interest primed

editors note rap has emerged as the most controversial form 
of youthful expression since rock n roll in the 1950s there was 
a time when elvis was considered obscene and had gone too far 
now groups such as the geto boys and 2 live crew have gone much 
further 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rap music without controversy would be like run 
without dmc like chuck d without something to say 
i think the government has a lot better things to take care of 
than the lyrics in rap music said chuck d referring to the 
recent obscenity trial of the rap group 2 live crew who were 
acquitted by a florida court joblessness homelessness better 
health care and education is what they need to worry about 
chuck d who was born carlton ridenhour in queens ny is not 
your ordinary rap star the music of his group public enemy 
concerns contemporary issues their videos dont have choreographed 
dance routines and chuck d doesnt wear gold chains he went to 
adelphi university and lives in a long island suburb 
he is in his cluttered office at the groups recording studio in 
hempstead ny wearing a detroit pistons tshirt paintsplotched 
sweat pants and a los angeles kings baseball cap backwards 
materialism isnt good for the black community chuck d 
says it just has everybody questing for that money and if that 
money is in very few areas and you dont have the knowhow or the 
opportunity to get it then youre gonna start feeding off each 
other 
not that chuck d cant afford gold chains the band that has 
attempted a leveraged buyout of controversy began its second world 
tour of the year on oct 27 making stops in the rap havens of hong 
kong and australia among others 
the groups third album fear of a black planet was 
released earlier this year and has gone platinum more than 1 
million copies sold public enemy completed a 55city american 
tour in early september which preceded a sevencity canadian tour 
the selfstyled prophets of rage have thrived without 
softening their sound the band has not candycoated its lyrics to 
accommodate the pop charts 
i dont duck no issues chuck d said i come down on 
brothers maybe five six times an album i got to come down on 
sisters sometimes too for their faults nobodys not guilty just 
like i come down on white supremacy i got to come down on 
everybody 
on brothers gonna work it out chuck d implores historians 
to tell the truth of the black americans plight 
on 911 is a joke chucks partner in rhyme the jesterlike 
flavor flav born charles drayton berates the response time of 
emergency medical service crews declaring ill call a cab 
cause a cabll come quicker 
and on welcome to the terrordome chuck d enraged the jewish 
community with crucifixion aint no fiction socalled chosen 
frozen apologies made to whoever pleases still they got me like 
jesus 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith denounced the lyrics 
of welcome to the terrordome as antisemitic which was nothing 
new to public enemy in 1989 former band member professor griff 
blamed jews for the majority of wickedness that goes on across 
the globe 
the album also attacked the black hands responsible for the 
murders of muslim leader malcolm x and black panther huey newton 
the white teenagers in brooklyn who killed a black teenager and 
the 1989 virginia beach riots 
these people are just stuck on those lines and didnt know 
what the rest of the song said said chuck d who says he is not 
antisemitic just problack that song dealt with a lot of 
different issues different things 
if you want bmws sexy ladies and selfaggrandizement listen to 
eric b and rakim if you want popular paprap turn on mtv and 
check out mc hammer rap cognoscenti have come to expect the 
unexpected from public enemy 
public enemys first album yo bum rush the show was 
released in 1987 but the groups breakthrough album was the widely 
acclaimed it takes a nation of millions to hold us back issued 
the following year the hit single dont believe the hype asked 
listeners to form their own opinions about the group without the 
influence of the media 
ah yes the media public enemy is not into public relations 
chuck d described a new york times reporter as being on his own 
trip he called the new york post the worst piece of on the 
planet harry allen the groups public relations director goes 
by the title of media assassin 
most of my criticism has come through white male critics 
chuck d said who are they to give me criticism when im 
talking about a serious situation going on in my community that 
they dont hardly know about 
my suggestion to white critics is that they should know what 
theyre talking about 
the group also has a dj named terminator x whose real name is 
norman rogers and a security force that accompanies them onstage 
they dont do much except stand around in army fatigues and red 
berets carrying fake uzis and looking mean 
despite his importance in the music industry chuck d does not 
covet the title of rappo de tutti rappi he is unassuming and 
has no misconceptions of his own grandiosity 
i dont really look at myself as being the man because its 
usually interchangeable with other people he said it feels 
very good just to share a seat with the other rappers 
the phone rings and its the flav he has to go to connecticut 
and cant come in to finish up the groups latest project titled 
get the outta dodge the title is a reference to dodge 
city which is quickly becoming a euphemism for new york and its 
wildwest atmosphere 
new york is a bad territory because of the limited 
opportunites for the black communities and the growing amount of 
limited opportunities in the white community chuck d said 
his solution is a blueprint for marxism 
id like to make it even all the way around where 100 percent 
of the people share 100 percent of the product he said 
there should be a salary cap there shouldnt be ones at the 
bottom with nothing no one should go without theres enough in 
this world for everybody to have

now groups such as the geto boys and 2 live crew have gone much

houston rappers the geto boys are scatological 
misogynist violent and homophobic their critics say 
maybe they respond but theyre not apologetic 
the geto boys would rather be hated for what we are than loved 
for what we are not says bushwick bill onefourth of the 
controversial crew whose new album made headlines before a single 
copy was available 
hated youve got it 
an indiana plant refused to press copies of the geto boys 
because of its offensive lyrics geffen records backed out of a 
national record distribution deal for the same reason two record 
store chains will not sell the groups national debut 
the national organization for women charges their lyrics promote 
violence against women the flap over their songs such as mind of 
a lunatic and a pair of unprintable titles caused some people 
including exnew york mayor edward koch to add their voices to the 
antigeto boys chorus 
the geto boys sing rap songs so foul that their own record 
company refuses to distribute their album wrote koch who 
decried their sickening lyrics and suggested the group 
encouraged rape and mayhem 
does all this bother bushwick bill he responds with an 
obscenity a no and a fastpaced defense of his record 
i always knew they cant stop the truth the truth is going to 
be heard were holding a mirror up to america and letting them 
see their naked selves who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of 
men thats the mirror were holding up says bushwick 
its also a mirror of houstons fifth ward the desolate 
neighborhood the group once called home although none of the four 
lives there anymore it remains their base of operations 
the band celebrated the release of its new album last month with 
a party at club obsession in the old hood the loyalty lies in 
part with their support there the band sold 500000 copies of its 
last album on the local rapalot label before signing a national 
deal 
the fifth ward is shotgun shacks houses ined up beside each 
other theres a lot of wild dogs prostitution needles on the 
floor says bushwick if youre walking down the street and you 
look wrong somebodyll beat your 
how it was growing up in the fifth ward is reflected in their 
lyrics in such songs as assassins and city under siege 
some kids never even make the milk cartons thats why we can 
hit hard like that because thats how we grew up says bushwick 
you step out the front door its survival you only get a 
minute to pray and a second to die 
the geto boys are not alone in the controversy over rap lyrics 
but unlike 2 live crew who were recently acquitted of obscenity 
charges in florida the geto boys choose not to use the first 
amendment as a explanation for their lyrics 
according to the same constitution were considered 
threefourths of a human being bushwick said the first 
amendment doesnt apply to us weve never been protected by 
any american law 
the one song that has drawn the most criticism is mind of a 
lunatic in which the band details the rape and murder of a 
random victim chosen only because her curtains are open bushwick 
defends the song comparing it to the work of alfred hitchcock 
i dont get it when alfred hitchcock directed psycho he 
filmed from a maniacs point of view his fears his feelings his 
thoughts says bushwick thats how we wrote mind of a 
lunatic alfred did the same thing i think it has a lot to do 
with race 
the group including the diminutive bushwick is all black 
the flap over the album hasnt persuaded anyone in the band to 
change his approach in fact says bushwick it has strengthened 
their resolve to get it done their own way 
well keep on calling it the way we see it concludes 
bushwick just because its not going on in your neighborhood 
doesnt mean it isnt going on

editors note rap has emerged as the most controversial form 
of youthful expression since rock n roll in the 1950s there was 
a time when elvis was considered obscene and had gone too far 
now groups such as the geto boys and 2 live crew have gone much 
further

hurricane the aptly named emcee of the afros 
paused during a recent interview and noted the parental advisory 
label on the rap groups debut album 
he then picked up a reporters tape recorder and pressed the 
microphone against his mouth and intoned 
they dont want to see a black man make it those people who 
disagree they dont want to see us make it we dont want to sell 
drugs were trying to stay clear of drugs we dont want to rob 
nobody we want to make records and express ourselves with records 
growing up in the ghetto we got attitudes 
and this is supposed to be a mellow day for hurricane and fellow 
afros who picked at a lunch of baconburgers and orange juice as 
they spoke at the manhattan offices of columbia records 
theyre not as nasty as 2 live crew but thats not because they 
dont wanna be kickin afrolistics has plenty of strong words 
most of them suitable for airplay and a point of view that 
hurricane advises will only get more explicit 
we didnt want to come out and be just any rappers he said 
it would be kind of hard to get attention we decided to be 
afros as in afroamericans afros symbolize black power we knew 
the reaction would be oh wow 
the afros are veterans in this business or to put it another 
way theyre the oldest established permanent floating rap game in 
new york emcees hurricane and kool tee grew up a few houses from 
each other in queens the same neighborhood as rundmcs jam 
master jay and started rapping in 1976 before anyone had even 
heard of rap and when everyone had heard of afros 
it was all for fun at first hanging out in the park and 
chanting dirty nursery rhymes youd otherwise find scratched on 
bathroom walls but the better they became the more they thought 
about it as a way of life the afros started rapping at house 
parties then clubs and when rundmc and others hit it big in the 
1980s they figured their turn was coming 
were not rockers and were not rampb and we cant sing 
hurricane said the young black generation has the gift of being 
able to rap and we are part of that young black generation we can 
rap off anything jazz rampb rock rap brings back people you 
forgot about we bring back parliamant james brown rick james 
 
how many afros there are depends on who happens to show up on a 
particular day hurricane born wendel fyte kool tee born tadone 
hill and deejay kippyo whose real name is kip morgan were 
around for the interview auxiliary afros actually afros 
auxiliary smith doc cool e aka the dictionary jah easy 
randy marvin davy d and jam master jay are out there spreading 
the word 
the afros are also friendly with public enemy and toured with 
them this summer most of the memories are happy ones at least 
when they were the only people on stage 
we almost got arrested in augusta ga kool tee said we 
were doing a song called hoe cakes and nobody told us when we got 
on stage we cant curse we came to the show late we came on stage 
and they wanted to arrest and our manager talked them out of it 
they put the handcuffs out and they said we run a clean city 
here we dont have stuff like that here 
most of the 16 songs on kickin afrolistics such as afro 
like a mutha coolin with the fros and the single feel 
it are goodtime raps but the record becomes more serious on 
straight from the penial and federal offense 
i was looking in the paper and i was reading about six bodies 
found in the water hurricane said i just started singing six 
bodies found in the water the people said it was manslaughter we 
came up with federal offense 
the afros get inspiration from television magazines the 
streets and probably orange juice and baconburgers if they put 
their minds to it because of all the time spent performing on 
stage and trying to hook up with a label the record took three 
years to make finding the right bass sound for jump also 
caused delays 
they see themselves coming from the same direction as public 
enemy talking about black power and ways of encouraging young fans 
to express themselves the afro hairdos may be the first thing you 
notice but hurricane promises the songs will be just as memorable 
i held back a little on this album he said first you get 
their attention and when you got their support you just slam em 
with everything the next album were gonna slam em

sing as if you stuck your finger in a hot frying 
pan or write songs about drugs deals and desperation and people 
might get the idea youre a little unhappy 
but the members of soul asylum insist theyre not bitter or 
cynical just realistic dragging people down is not what this band 
stands for even if they do present life in threeminute bursts of 
agony 
singerguitarist dave pirner for instance is a veteran of 
flipping burgers and mowing lawns who cites the groups very 
existence as proof that none of them are giving up 
you know you got to work hard for your good times says 
pirner speaking in a groan that recalls a 45 rpm record being 
played at 33 you got something to get off your chest and youre 
actually celebrating the fact youre spitting it all out and 
putting the cards on the table 
its like blues music its pretty bleak stuff people are 
trying to get stuff out in the open and share it with people who 
identify with things that arent always sex driving and dancing 
soul asylum and the horse they rode on the bands first 
record since 1988 was produced by steve jordan who worked on 
keith richards talk is cheap lp 
the music is fast and tight ranging from guitar raveups such 
as bitter pill and be on your way to the bluesy nice 
guys to the rockabillyinfluenced brand new shine 
with all that noise and no lyric sheet its not easy to catch 
the words but occasionally they slow down to make sure a key 
phrase if i lost my mind would you help me find it or its 
not supposed to make you feel so helpless is not missed 
we kind of sat down and talked about the idea of this being a 
band and bringing it back to what its all about in the first 
place pirner said steve said you guys are about playing 
live you guys are a band and we want to emphasize that as much as 
possible 
these songs are in a story format said guitarist dan 
murphy youre trying to put something down that people are going 
to listen to outside the context of a rock concert i prefer 
something thats thoughtprovoking or having some imagery 
murphy drummer grant young and bassist karl mueller attended 
the same high school in minneapolis and they hooked up with pirner 
a couple of years later they were originally called loud fast 
rules and were a terrible band the band that wouldnt go away 
murphy recalled 
the scariest show i remember playing was in philadelphia he 
said there was a capacity of 600 and they put in a thousand 
people these people seemed like they wanted to kill each other and 
then kill us bottles were flying 
in london the same thing happened there was a pub and people 
were just killing each other 
youd stop the song pirner added and people would slow 
down a bit then youd start the next one and theyd start punching 
each other again 
somehow band and listeners stuck it out and soul asylum went 
on to share bills with the replacements husker du and even billy 
idol by 1984 they had signed with twintone records and released 
their debut album say what you will 
other records include hang time and clam dip and other 
delights and they have covered such songs as james browns hot 
pants the bangles walk like an egyptian and dr johns 
right place wrong time in 1987 the group signed with a major 
label aampm records 
soul asylum now faces the same challenge as any rock n roll 
band thats been around a few years keep the spirit that drove 
your early records but dont try to make them sound the same 
so if pirners flicking ashes into the cuffs of his rolledup 
jeans suggests incurable adolescence murphys talk of getting 
our business licks down and raising a family indicates the band 
is looking for ways to become more adult but not less contemporary 
being 28 is pretty staggering in a lot of ways said murphy 
who became a father late last year its not fun anymore and its 
time to get on with your life you got to keep asking quesitons if 
things were easy for us we could start singing about sports cars 
its my occupation but its not my life weve been at it 
long enough that we all have a pretty good sense of who we are 
when the well runs dry well be fine

the stillness of this ancient 
oasis is shattered now and then by army gunfire or israeli soldiers 
shouting through loudspeakers this is a curfew anyone leaving 
his house will be punished 
for jericho the israelis are the latest of many invaders like 
the warrior joshua who felled its famous walls with a blast of 
trumpets and put a curse on any man who would rebuild the town 
on scorching summer days when the sun beats down and mosquitoes 
and flies buzz through mudbrick huts and white stone houses it 
seems as if joshuas curse still afflicts the town which is as old 
as civilization 
yet jericho is a place of rare beauty the sweet smells of 
jasmine and orange blossoms waft through the air bursts of red and 
orange bougainvillea dot the lush green of the oasis against a 
backdrop of the dusty judean hills 
it also has come to resemble a ghost town during the 34month 
palestinian uprising stores and restaurants close at noon on 
orders from proplo leaders who want a united front against israeli 
occupation few of the 12000 palestinian townspeople come out 
its boring now the only thing i do in the evenings is visit 
my friends said wajihah godah 28 who works as a secretary in 
jerusalem about 20 miles away 
after sundown the streets belong to the soldiers and the 
shebab teenage activists who mask their faces with 
blackandwhite checked arab headdresses called keffiyehs 
in the darkness the shebab move silently through gardens and 
alleys spraying walls with slogans like plo israel no or a 
favorite mocking symbol a nazi swastika paired with a jewish star 
of david 
they stone israeli cars racing along the main road from 
jerusalem to tiberias a prize target is the black limousine of 
foreign minister david levy who commutes through part of the west 
bank between jerusalem and his home in beit shean an israeli town 
the uprising has taken 10 lives in jericho and the neighboring 
refugee camps of aqabat jaber and ein sultan 
four israelis were killed in the firebombing of a bus israelis 
shot three palestinians to death and three others were slain by 
fellow arabs who suspected them of being informers 
more people have been killed in other places and sometimes 
outsiders say jericho sleeps while the rest of the west bank and 
gaza strip is burning 
winters are mild in jericho and it was a favorite resort of 
arabs before israel seized the west bank from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war christian pilgrims curious israelis and west bank 
residents kept it going afterward 
until the uprising bands played arabic music in garden 
restaurants along the main road stately matrons with scarves tied 
around their hips sometimes performed sensuous belly dances to 
shouts and applause 
young men chainsmoking american cigarettes played cards in 
the coffeeshops israelis stopped on the way home from outings at 
the dead sea to buy pottery or pomelas a footballsized citrus 
fruit grown in the area 
busloads of foreign tourists came to see jericho which is the 
lowest town on earth at 850 feet below sea level in addition to 
being one of the oldest and bestknown 
they climbed to the byzantine monastery of the temptation 
carved into a steep hillside north of town to mark where the bible 
says the devil tempted jesus for 40 days or toured nearby tel 
sultan where remains of city walls date from 7000 bc 
the garden restaurants are closed now israelis and most foreign 
tourists stay away for fear of being stoned 
jerichos people have adapted to the rebellion and the boredom 
when leaders of the uprising called a oneweek strike to protest 
the killings of 20 palestinians on temple mount in jerusalem the 
three video shop owners dutifully closed but still did booming 
business renting movies from their homes or car trunks 
frequent general strikes leave plenty of time for visiting in 
the evenings families sit on garden chairs in their front yards 
scrutinizing whoever passes 
sometimes its only a herd of goats or an army foot patrol but 
if someone familiar comes along and in jericho thats nearly 
everyone they call out tfadalu arabic for please come 
in 
each arrival is offered tea with fresh mint and in return 
contributes a little gossip a recent tidbit concerned a man who 
charged into a neighbors house after her goats ate his flowers 
and now fears revenge from her angry clan 
saeb erakat a journalist from jericho who supports the 
palestine liberation organization says the uprising has brought 
people closer 
divorce rates are down there has been a big decline in family 
feuds and people share more because of the economic hardships he 
said 
amid the upheavals of occupation and uprising jerichos people 
take some comfort from its turbulent history 
they live among cultural relics of romans crusaders ottoman 
turks and other invaders 
all the foreign armies left eventually

if many wall street crystal balls are 
functioning properly the federal reserve may soon get more 
aggressive in its efforts to lower interest rates and stimulate the 
sagging economy 
signs of an incipient recession are building up analysts note 
increasing pressure on the fed to do something to brake the 
economys slide 
furthermore they argue the forces that have militated against 
an easing of the central banks credit policy most notably fears 
of inflation are showing signs of ebbing 
but these same observers caution that a new approach by the fed 
would come with no guarantee of fast effective relief for the 
problems afflicting the economy and the stock market 
they say there is a real danger that chairman alan greenspan and 
his colleagues will find themselves pushing on a string 
trying to prod the economy without getting much immediate response 
on the other end 
the economy started to dive in early october says edward 
yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities 
yardeni says a fullscale recession might still be staved off if 
some sudden resolution of the showdown in the persian gulf drove 
oil prices below 20 a barrel but that he acknowledges looks 
like a longshot proposition at best 
a better bet is that the federal reserve is likely to lower 
shortterm interest rates very sharply very soon he asserts 
the economy desperately needs easier monetary policy 
the rise of the civilian unemployment rate from 54 percent at 
the start of the summer to 57 percent last month provides one 
rationale for fed easing 
the bush administration and congress also helped clear the way 
by reaching agreement at last in late october on a federal budget 
plan even though the measure is expected to put only a slight dent 
in the government deficit 
the fed gave a nod of acknowledgment to that development last 
monday with moves that pushed down the interest rate on federal 
funds or overnight loans between banks from the neighborhood of 8 
percent to about 75 percent 
with a bit more oomph behind it soon yardeni says the federal 
funds rate is likely to hit 725 percent by yearend and 675 
percent by march 1991 
for the past several months the feds maneuvering room has been 
widely viewed as limited because of inflation worries in general 
and soaring oil prices in particular 
if the fed sought to ease it was widely believed longterm 
interest rates might actually rise rather than fall because bond 
traders feared that the authorities were abandoning their 
antiinflation stand 
now however economists say recent declines in a wide range of 
commodity prices other than oil have cooled inflationary fears 
what may prompt fed action faster than anything else many 
analysts agree is the shaky state of the banking system 
as we see it over the next several months investors like the 
central bank will switch anxieties says robert barbera 
economist at shearson lehman brothers 
deflation worries reflecting falling asset prices and banking 
system fissures will soon overwhelm inflation concerns 
in the world of banking barbera says strains normally 
associated with recession are already acute recently us 
financial markets have been confronted with the first signs of bank 
funding difficulties 
when the banking systems safety and soundness are called into 
question dramatic ease is the necessary response and we are 
confident that the fed will deliver

the songs of cole porter have come alive 
again for a cause the composer couldnt have imagined before his 
death in 1964 
red hot and blue a benefit album for aids research and 
relief matches such artists as u2 sinead oconnor fine young 
cannibals neneh cherry and the neville brothers to songs made 
popular in the 1930s and 40s 
the 20song cd is a daydream come true for new york city art 
critic john carlin and his friends at the new york city law firm 
that manages the late songwriters trust fund 
it struck me that the cole porter songs were a wonderful way 
to make a contemporary record that would appeal to all sorts of 
people and deliver a message said carlin who wanted to do 
something for friends dying of aids 
everyone loves cole porter he said no ones covered his 
songs for 20 or 30 years in the back of my mind i always wondered 
what it would be like for david byrne to sing a cole porter song 
or tom waits 
in those cases it sounds a lot like how byrne and waits sing 
their own songs but other results will surprise fans of both 
porter and contemporary music like the jungle brothers rap on 
i get a kick out of you and the torch song stylings of country 
star kd lang and dancepop singer jody watley 
the songs worked better than we dreamed carlin said what 
was a simple love ballad when played in this context took on a 
different meaning 
porters career stretched from the 20s through the 50s his 
songs were a staple on broadway and in movies and he was known for 
his humorous often boundarybreaking treatments of love and sex 
aids of course wasnt a worry when porter was around on a few 
of the new versions of porters songs particularly cherrys blunt 
rap to ive got you under my skin the disease is addressed 
it was the initial participation of cherry and byrne that really 
got the project going because it helped convince other artists to 
join in carlin said carlin and two entertainment lawyers who work 
at the law firm that manages the porter trust fund f richard 
pappas and leigh blake put it together 
the album veers recklessly from style to style theres the 
campy rock duet of deborah harry and iggy pop on well did you 
evah the cool soul of fine young cannibals love for sale 
the african language version of begin the beguine by salif 
keita and the rollicking irish duet by kirsty maccoll and the 
pogues on miss otis regrets 
despite the albums variety carlin concedes theres something 
missing the album has no latin ifluences and not enough black 
voices an important omission considering the impact of aids in 
those communities 
and there are no heavy metal artists 
carlin said the lack of hard rock artists was largely by design 
he didnt feel the genre was appropriate to porters songs its 
also because he said that community is without a doubt the most 
homophobic in the music business 
last year the gay mens health crisis in new york city dropped 
the band guns n roses from an aids benefit concert after 
organization volunteers noted the lyrics to one of their songs 
one in a million contained the lyrics immigrants and 
faggots they make no sense to me 
several artists asked to participate refused because of the 
stigma attached to aids and homosexuality carlin said 
there were a few big artists he said i dont want to 
give the names of people who didnt do it for the wrong reasons 
im surprised at how many artists we did get 
the only artist carlin will reveal who turned down a request to 
participate was prince but it had nothing to do with homophobia 
carlin said he wanted him to record a version of lets 
misbehave but prince was too busy on his graffiti bridge 
movie and soundtrack 
when organizers approached an artist to ask for involvement 
they suggested a tune from the porter songbook most took the 
advice some artists including maccoll and watley had their own 
ideas for songs 
we wanted the album to be very modern and very 
youthoriented carlin said we wanted a club sound not an 
ella fitzgerald sound 
watley known for her dance music remembered a fitzgerald 
recording she listened to as a child to use as a model for her 
version of after you who she said she relished the chance to 
sing a jazz tune something she cant do on her own records 
after recording this song ive been asked by virtually 
everyone who heard it are you going to do an album like this 
watley said even my mom asked me that 
an expert on porters work said hes excited about the project 
and predicted that porter would have been too 
the man was insatiable in his curiosity and he traveled all 
over the world to listen to all kinds of performances of his 
music said robert kimball whos written and edited several 
books on porters music he was genuinely open to all different 
interpretations my feeling is he would have reacted very 
enthusiastically to it 
a 90minute tv special featuring videos of artists performing 
their porter songs is scheduled to air on abctv at 1130 pm on 
dec 1 a videocassette is expected to be released next year 
the lawyers have formed a nonprofit corporation called king 
cole inc that will funnel profits from red hot and blue to 
aids organizations all over the world a committee of 
representatives from the project including musicians and 
filmmakers will recommend which charities receive the money

the 1990 campaign has been a little like the 
capricious new england weather if you dont like it just wait a 
minute 
less than six months ago politicians were at fever pitch over a 
constitutional amendment to ban flagburning reluctant democrats 
feared for their patriotic reputations crusading republicans 
smelled blood 
its hard now to recall the passion and acrimony generated by 
that once blazing concern and harder still to find traces of it on 
the campaign trail 
ephemeral fickle call the season what you will but issues 
came and went almost as quickly as movies of the week until the 
campaign came home to roost in voter pocketbooks 
the only national issue is the economy taxes economic 
leadership and fairness its driving the entire electorate said 
analyst stuart rothenberg publisher of the political report 
president bush attempted to shift voter attention to the persian 
gulf in the final days of the campaign heating up his rhetoric and 
declaring he had lost patience with iraqs saddam hussein 
the president succeeded in dominating the news with an issue 
that traditionally favors his party but most analysts predicted 
that the economic themes working to the democrats advantage would 
remain an influential factor in the election 
when candidates first hit the campaign trail months ago kuwait 
had not yet been invaded recession worries were hypothetical and 
budget talks were a speck on the distant horizon 
emotional values issues were the political currency of the 
moment some candidates pledged their allegiance to the 
flagburning ban others stoked the controversy over federally 
funded obscene art 
bigstate gubernatorial candidates waged a spirited competition 
over who would order the most executions deny the most paroles 
propose the harshest penalties for drugusers 
congress was put on the defensive for voting itself a pay raise 
and then became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal the 
issues proved potent in a smattering of races and planted the 
first seeds of antiincumbent richvspoor sentiment among 
voters 
abortion also took a brief turn on center stage but the waters 
got muddied and the issue lost its fire both parties ran 
candidates with a full range of positions states meanwhile 
failed to impose the serious restrictions anticipated in the wake 
of a 1989 supreme court decision and abortion moved to the wings 
in most races 
the spotted owl flew by and prompted intense debate in the 
northwest but the conflict over whether to protect forest habitat 
for the tiny owl at the expense of logging jobs never broadened 
into a compelling national issue and environmental concerns 
colored only scattered races across the country 
communism fell and the peace dividend arose early in the 
campaign candidates proposed 50percent cuts in military spending 
and argued over whether to use the money saved from the cold war 
thaw to expand domestic programs or reduce the deficit 
then came the latesummer iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 
deployment of us troops to saudi arabia the peace dividend 
vanished like a mirage in the blinding desert sun the nation 
worried about war incumbents looked like statesmen and other 
issues temporarily were swept aside 
but politicians of both parties rallied behind bushs policies 
the standoff dragged on without shooting and the issue waned until 
bush sought to revive it at the end 
the declining economy and turbulent federal budget negotiations 
combined in september to produce the potent pocketbook themes that 
dominated the campaigns final weeks 
the battle cry of no new taxes turned into a debate over whose 
new taxes and voters witnesed a confusing chaotic struggle over 
their economic futures 
democrats railed at highflyers and the rich who got richer 
in the 1980s at everyone elses expense lets go and get it from 
those who got it sen barbara mikulski dmd declared during 
floor debate over whether to raise taxes on the wealthy 
the fairness pitch hadnt been particularly successful in 
the past and democratic leaders were not making much headway this 
year from the launchpad of the bipartisan sampl scandal 
then they received a series of assists from bush his reversal 
on the need for new taxes his insistence on a capital gains tax 
cut his painful public wavering on whether to raise taxes on the 
rich his failure to adequately explain his positions 
bush can truly take responsibility for whatever happens on 
tuesday said university of virginia political scientist larry 
sabato he created the democrats best issue one that they could 
never have created for themselves 
the republicans gave the democrats the ammunition agreed 
rothenberg 
analysts were not surprised that pocketbook issues ended up 
being pivotal 
democratic pollster geoff garin said the earlier boomlets 
were brief because its hard to sustain a political debate when 
there is no debate everybodys against drugs everybodys against 
sampl crooks 
the budget by contrast is a real live issue that really does 
raise differences garin said 
others suggested that some republicans drew the wrong 
conclusions from bushs successful use of patriotism and crime 
issues two years ago 
politicians thought they had learned a lesson from 1988 the 
importance of certain symbols the republicans pushing 
identification with them and the democrats trying not to look weak 
on them said rothenberg 
but those were better days 
symbolic issues only work in times of peace and prosperity 
said sabato whenever the economy weakens it always takes first 
place on the campaign agenda

a remedy for hard times has emerged take your 
lumps now and put the bad news behind you 
that was the strategy employed this past week by two big 
corporate names who chose to pay the piper now rather than later 
general motors corp the nations largest industrial company 
and eastman kodak co the 18th biggest took hefty charges in the 
third quarter to put some big problems to rest the charges turned 
profits into losses for both 
gm slugging through a slump in auto sales said it took a 21 
billion charge to cover the costs of plant closings and other 
production cutbacks the stunning accounting move esulted in a 2 
billion loss for the quarter the largest in automotive history 
it was a dismal quarter all around for the big three automakers 
ford motor co reported lower than expected earnings and chrysler 
registered a 214 million loss without its charge gm would have 
managed a gain of just 109 million 
the motivation for kodaks move was a 9095 million patent 
infringement judgment the company has been ordered to pay rival 
polaroid 
kodak officials said that although no money has changed hands 
and the case was still under appeal it was appropriate to book the 
charge right away 
that left the photographic company with a 206 million 
thirdquarter loss earnings would have risen 19 percent to 358 
million without the judgment 
was the bloodletting good medicine wall street thought so and 
registered its approval by bidding up shares of gm and kodak after 
their announcements 
experts said the moves went a long way toward wiping the slate 
clean for both companies although they still face stern 
competition in a tough economy

economic worries were prompting companies across the country to 
retrench citicorp general dynamics and aetna were among several 
announcing cutbacks many economists said it could be the start of 
something ugly 
we havent had a recession for so long that people forget what 
happens said bruce steinberg an economist at merrill lynch amp 
co 
the news on the economy continued to darken with the exception 
of a surprising government report that pegged economic growth at a 
strong 18 percent in the third quarter 
that hopeful report was later overshadowed by a litany of woe 
from several sources 
the governments economic forecasting gauge dropped 08 percent 
in september its second straight monthly drop by conventional 
wisdom three consecutive declines in the index of leading economic 
indicators signal a recession 
the government said unemployment held steady in october at 57 
percent but job erosion continued among manufacturing and 
construction payrolls a separate report showed construction 
spending in september took its deepest plunge since the 1982 
recession 
a report from the national association of purchasing management 
said october was the worst month for manufacturers in eight years 
business failures rose by 145 percent in the first nine months 
of the year according to dun amp bradstreet corp 
the economic policy institute a liberal think tank said heavy 
debts accumulated in the heady 1980s would make a recession longer 
and deeper than usual 
amid the gloom the federal reserve the nations central bank 
followed through on a promise to ease credit in response to the 
federal budget agreement the fed lowered a shortterm rate that 
banks charge each other for overnight loans but other interest 
rates werent expected to drop much unless the fed relaxes the 
credit reins even further

countering news of chryslers loss for the quarter was the 
announcement of its contract agreement with the united auto workers 
union 
the company and union reached the pact after 27 straight hours 
of bargaining averting a strike 
it was a settlement modeled after earlier agreements with gm and 
ford which pleased the union but left some observers wondering 
whether chrysler could digest it 
the pacts provisions for job security and protecting the income 
of laidoff workers apparently followed the gmford pattern to 
help offset those costs chrysler officials said they gained some 
flexibility to shift workers schedules and boost production of the

citicorp general dynamics aetna and general 
motors are only a few of the major employers that announced layoffs 
in recent days many economists say it could be just the start of a 
widespread job scaleback as the economy stalls 
there will be more layoffs the unemployment rate will rise 
job market conditions will deteriorate for the next six months or 
longer said bruce steinberg an economist at merrill lynch amp co 
we havent had a recession for so long that people forget what 
happens he said 
some economists said service jobs may be hit hardest thats due 
partly to the boom in the banking finance advertising and other 
service industries in the 1980s which allowed these companies to 
grow fat 
finance and banking companies were basically taking anyone who 
could walk through the door said economist robert dye of the 
wefa group an economic forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
but in the face of increasingly grim economic forecasts and 
figures compounded by the economic shock from the persian gulf 
standoff these companies have been letting go of workers in 
droves citicorp for one said it will eliminate 2000 jobs by the 
end of next year 
they grew too fast and this is the consequence of growing too 
fast a shakeout if you will said kenneth goldstein an 
economist with the conference board a new yorkbased business 
research group 
the slowdown among financial companies began with the wall 
street crash of october 1987 but it since has intensified as small 
investors have grown more cautious and avoided the stock and bond 
markets 
the crash along with the end of the real estate boom and the 
spread of the savings and loan crisis also hurt banks and 
insurers aetna life amp casualty co for example plans to 
eliminate 2600 jobs through layoffs and attrition 
manufacturing companies have fared somewhat better because they 
learned from the last recession eight years ago to keep operations 
lean economists said but the recent economic sluggishness has 
prompted many of them to lay off workers as well 
in perhaps the largest such cutback general motors corp said 
it would close four plants and idle others temporarily affecting 
thousands of workers experts say gm was responding to excess 
carmaking capacity as well as to the economy 
state and local government jobs also are facing cuts due to 
withering tax revenues reductions are planned by massachusetts 
virginia and the city of pittsburgh among others 
defense cutbacks also are hitting employment general dynamics 
corp said it will lay off 700 to 1000 workers in january because 
of budget cuts and declining demand for the f16 jet fighters 
in all industries middlemanagement jobs have been particularly 
hard hit economists say companies are cutting jobs not deemed 
crucial or revenueproducing 
regardless of the cause employers should view layoffs as a last 
resort said martha white a chicagobased consultant who helps 
troubled companies reorganize 
because the victims go away during a downsizing or layoffs 
people tend to think the problems go away but thats not true 
theres always residual fallout in the organization in the form 
of morale and loyalty problems that can hurt productivity she 
said 
some economists said they believe employers announcing layoffs 
recently were prompted by actual signs of economic decline not by 
a desire to take preemptive action before the downturn worsens 
that means more layoffs are almost certain if the sluggishness 
intensifies 
the labor department said last month that 1127000 people were 
out of work in september due to temporary layoffs up from 918000 
in june 
the unemployment rate in september actually was higher for 
manufacturing and lowskilled jobs than for whitecollar jobs the 
department said 
for example the jobless rate for managerial workers was 27 
percent in september virtually unchanged from a year earlier for 
lowskill manufacturing jobs it was 73 percent also almost 
unchanged from a year ago 
the impression has been created that there are just zillions 
of professionals who are suddenly out on the street but that is 
just not the case said jay meisenheimer a labor department 
economist 
private economists are looking to the release friday of october 
unemployment figures for further insight into the economys 
direction septembers overall rate was 57 percent up from 56 
percent in august 
several reports thursday indicated the economy continues to 
slow in one a widely watched monthly survey of purchasing 
executives indicated that manufacturing fell to its lowest level in 
eight years in october 
in another the labor department said the seasonally adjusted 
number of new unemployment claims filed in the week ended oct 20 
rose to its highest level in seven years 
but many economists are not forecasting a downturn as severe as 
the 198182 recession when unemployment hit 11 percent several 
say they dont expect unemployment to rise above 7 percent while 
others including the conference boards goldstein arent even 
predicting a fullblown recession

round of cutbacks is taking shape on wall street 
morgan stanley amp co on thursday announced 50 layoffs in its 
investment banking unit the new york stock exchange froze 
executive salaries and targeted an 8 percent staff reduction 
merrill lynch amp co expects to cut hundreds of jobs a first boston 
corp spokesman said cuts were expected by years end 
the securities industry has been locked in decline since the 
1987 stock market crash activity in the oncelucrative mergers and 
acquisitions area has plummeted bigtime fees for managing deals 
are a thing of the past individual investor activity also is down 
if people arent bringing in business youre running a 
loss said perrin long an analyst with lipper analytical 
securities corp you cant sit back and say times will be get 
better well just keep the people 
with the slowdown weve had in order to maintain some 
semblance of income before taxes you have to let people go long 
said 
according to securities data co us merger activity plummeted 
52 percent in the first nine months of 1990 total fees for 
securities underwriting another critical measure of profitability 
plunged to 15 billion in the period the lowest level since 1984 
the roaring profits of the 1980s are a distant memory as wall 
street undergoes another wave of cutbacks securities data said 
morgan stanley spokeswoman jean andrews said the firm wall 
streets second most profitable last year with 443 million in 
earnings planned to cut 50 professionals from its worldwide 
investment banking staff of 800 by the end of 1990 
she said the cuts would be across the board including some 
senior executives the investment banking division includes mergers 
and acquisitions corporate finance real estate and capital 
markets 
its in response to the current and expected business 
environment for the industry andrews said managing in this 
environment you always look at what resources you commit to these 
businesses 
morgan last week reported a 29 percent drop in thirdquarter 
earnings to 719 million from 101 million in the same 1989 
period the firm attributed the decline to a sharp drop in merchant 
banking and investment banking activity 
in the first nine months of the year morgan dropped to sixth 
place from first place in 1989 in the total value of merger deals 
completed to 309 billion in 89 deals from 833 billion in 119 
deals 
at first boston rumors circulated widely that the firm was 
planning a major restructuring to include hundreds of layoffs in 
coming days 
also thursday the nyse said it was freezing executive salaries 
for 1991 and enacting an early retirement plan in an effort to trim 
about 8 percent of its staff next year 
earlier this week merrill lynch the nations biggest 
securities firm announced a major restructuring that it expects 
will lead to hundreds of layoffs 
and oppenheimer amp co this week had the credit rating of some of 
its debt downgraded an especially tough blow because wall street 
firms rely on shortterm loans to sustain daily operations 
standard amp poors corp attributed its action to a weak operating 
performance due largely to a poor retail market and trading 
conditions 
first boston workers said talk has focused on staff cuts of up 
to 10 percent involving investment banking and backoffice 
personnel to be announced early next week 
a first boston spokesman said the company was reviewing all its 
businesses and some cuts were expected by the end of the year but 
the spokesman said reports of a dday for layoffs constituted 
unfounded rumor and speculation 
it looks like there is a consistent overcapacity vis a vis 
customer and client demand well shrink said the spokesman who

some of the nations giant oil companies 
suddenly are proclaiming steps to conserve energy and protect the 
earth in what almost seems a battle over which one can be the 
biggest environmentalist 
within a 24hour span this week four of the majors announced 
media efforts with an environmental spin the greener stance comes 
as the industry is disputing charges of pricegouging and 
profiteering from the persian gulf crisis but it remained unclear 
if the timing was coincidental or intentional 
as the conservation campaigns got under way chevron corp 
issued a report on the environment that said its trying to 
protect elephants and rhinos in sumatra 
texaco inc kicked off a conservation drive called lets put 
our energy into saving it which will include a barrage of print 
and broadcast advertising that urges consumers to use less fuel in 
cars and homes 
exxon corp announced it was distributing two types of cleaner 
fuel to help improve air quality 
amoco corp saying its time to think green unveiled a 2 
billion package of energy initatives that range from cleaner fuel 
to lowfume gasoline pumps 
some environmentalists found themselves at a loss for comment 
when asked thursday about the oil companies new stance some 
expressed cautious optimism and others questioned the timing of the 
media blitz 
i applaud the litle things they do but theyre still a long 
way from being green said michael francis of the wilderness 
society they want to keep this nation addicted to oil for one 
reason their profits 
the oil companies disputed contentions they were trying to 
polish their image amid the current oil shock although texaco 
acknowledged that would be a welcome side effect 
as the companies put forth their environmental messages they 
even acted like they were trying to outdo each other in a 
competition over who could be the greenest 
chevrons claimed a reputation as one of the petroleum 
industrys most environmentally responsible companies 
exxon which became an environmentalist hateobject after the 
valdez oil spill in alaska called itself the leading producer of 
gasolines reformulated to reduce pollution with cleaner fuels 
available in more than 50 markets 
amoco spokesman neil geary responded exxons talking about 
making changes in two grades our product in all three grades in 
the washington baltimore and richmond markets meets the clean air 
act standards for 1992 
amocos environmental battle plan was unveiled thursday in a 
washington news confernce at a model fullservice gas station 
equipped with new and more effective amocodesigned gasoline pump 
recovery nozzles a used motor oil recycling collection facility 
for any motorists who change their own oil and a compressed 
natural gas fueling facility for select fleet vehicle use 
i think we were the only guys with a thoroughly prepared press 
conference today geary said we had vehicles that are actually 
dualfuel they are able to run on both gasoline and compressed 
natural gas weve already got the pump installed we had all these 
other elements in place i kind of get the sense other people are 
rushing to get stuff out on the wire 
not so said texaco which had its fuelsaving package out in 
new york a day earlier 
our conservation initiative has been in the works for a couple 
of months texaco spokeswoman anita m larsen said we act 
independently from other companies this is not in reaction to what 
anyone else is doing 
chevrons media package was in earth tones on recycled 
recyclable paper 
amoco prominently pointed out that its media package also was 
made of recycled paper it went a step further by including a deck 
of cards for playing an amoco trivia game environmental 
pursuits 
texaco however was not immediately sure whether the paper in 
its media package was recycled 
that was pulled from existing stock whatever we had ms

pathe communications corps 136 
billion buyout of mgmua is finally a done deal but whether the 
historic studio and its trademark lion will roar again remains 
uncertain 
the new enterprise like the pending purchase of mca inc by 
matsushita electric industrial co seeks to exploit an 
international hunger for hollywood entertainment pathes holdings 
are mainly european 
but unlike robust sony corp which last year bought columbia 
pictures entertainment giancarlo parrettis cashpoor pathe 
labored for months to close the mgmua deal 
bringing success to the new studio will be a struggle analysts 
say 
wall street experts have said it will take at least 500 million 
and several years to revive mgmua whose recent releases range 
from hits such as rain man to box office bombs such as 
desperate hours 
pathe has mortgaged its future said jessica reif an analyst 
for first boston corp the new studios budget and its profits 
reif said will be tied up in the sale of foreign domestic and 
home video rights to nearly every movie in the combined 
pathemgmua libraries for the next 10 years 
speaking on condition of anonymity an executive for a rival 
studio said the newly formed mgmpathe communications co will need 
hit movies fast he estimated the price paid may have been double 
the studios worth 
pathe officials say they paid a fair price and intend to 
recapture the oncelegendary status of mgm 
parretti spokeswoman arlene cattani said the italian financier 
took possession of the studio and its leo the lion trademark at 
1107 am pst 
a beaming parretti later was greeted in his offices with a 
surprise from his staff a real lion named sudan to personify 
the deals closing he gingerly sidled up to the 450pound brute 
for a few quick photographs 
our goal is to make the mgm lion roar again parretti said 
in a statement we will continue to develop the kind of product 
that has made the mgm and ua names legendary for generations while 
building on pathes global presence 
the buyout pays stockholders of mgmua a total of 2150 per 
share earlier payments of 4 a share were made this summer 
craig parsons a spokesman for pathe said parretti would become 
chief executive officer he and his longtime associate florio 
fiorini will be named cochairmen 
pathe entertainments alan ladd jr part of a host of film 
executives who headed mgmua will run the new studio parsons 
said 
beverly hillsbased pathe produces television and feature films 
it also has a variety of european movierelated holdings 
as part of the complicated transaction mgmua will buy pathes 
assets for 700 million raised in part through the sale of rights 
to a variety of pathe mgm and united artists film and television 
properties that 700 million will then be used to help buy mgmua 
independently pathe raised 600 million through stock sales to 
unidentified european investors 
those entities are believed to include parrettis principal 
holding company com finance sa of luxembourg his melia 
international one of the worlds largest travel agencies and the 
spanish real estate business renta inmobiliaria sa 
an earlier mgmua sale to pathe fell apart last spring when time 
warner inc backed out of its agreement to finance 650 million of 
the deal 
pathe spokesman parsons said company officials are very 
comfortable with production financing which will be partially 
underwritten by one new film a month he said 
no new debt is involved in the deal parsons said mgmua 
currently has about 400 million in debt and pathe owes 300 
million 
for mgmuas current management the future is unclear chief 
executive jeffrey barbakow and studio chief richard berger did not 
return phone calls seeking comment thursday 
mgmua majority stockholder kirk kerkorian offered the culver 
citybased studio for sale in april 1988 
a spectrum of suitors including japans sony and c itoh

mcdonalds corps decision to eliminate plastic 
foam containers for its food is being hailed by environmental 
groups but its no source of joy for a company that recycles that 
plastic foam 
mcdonalds president edward rensi announced thursday the goal of 
eliminating within 60 days the polystrene boxes that now cradle 
millions of the fastfood giants big macs and other sandwiches 
under pressure from environmental groups which say the 
clamshellshaped boxes add to the nations overflowing garbage 
crisis rensi said the company had decided to do whats right 
although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging 
is environmentally sound our customers just dont feel good about 
it rensi said by telephone from the companys suburban oak brook 
headquarters so were changing 
the change was sudden as recently as last week mcdonalds had 
been defending the use of plastic foam and was planning to extend 
an experimental plastic recycling program to all of its 8500 
restaurants nationwide 
when we learned they were planning to go to comprehensive 
recycling we reacted strongly said frederic d krupp executive 
director of the environmental defense fund which opposes 
polystrene foam use 
the announced shift to paper containers did not please the 
national polystyrene recycling co which is trying to establish a 
nationwide network of plastic foam recycling centers from its 
headquarters in suburban lincolnshire 
nprc is disappointed to learn that mcdonalds has decided to 
phase out its use of polystyrene foam packaging said nprc 
president e james schneiders but he said the company can count on 
many other sources for its recycling centers 
schneiders also said mcdonalds has proved to be an important 
educational tool in making the public conscious of recycling in 
general and plastic recycling in particular 
a number of us towns and cities have banned the use of 
polystyrene foam saying it not only contributes to landfill 
problems but also contains chemicals that harm the earths ozone 
level 
environmentalists praised thursdays decision but a spokesman 
for the packaging industry said mcdonalds was folding to pressure 
that isnt based on fact 
you dont want to get rid of them polystyrene products all 
together said joseph bow president of the foodservice amp 
packaging institute in washington they provide consumers with a 
sanitary and timesaving method of food delivery 
mcdonalds is bowing to public pressure that is based on 
misperceptions and misinformation said bow 
a spokeswoman for the us environmental protection agency in 
washington said her agency had no studies that indicated foam 
packaging is environmentally sound 
on the other hand said spokeswoman robin woods it may not be 
an environmental hazard because its inert its not something that 
breaks down easily and leaches into landfills for example 
krupp though predicted that mcdonalds has begun writing the 
industrywide obituary on polystyrene 
mcdonalds understands that the future is green krupp said 
i think other companies will follow suit 
jerry johnson executive director of the polystyrene packaging 
council in washington disagreed 
mcdonalds is a major user but theyre not that big that they 
influence the total market here johnson said there are still 
many places where polystyrene is used and used because it is one 
of the most environmentally responsible materials used in the 
packaging industry today 
mcdonalds vice president shelby yastrow said the polystyrene 
containers are made for mcdonalds by from five to seven companies 
including amoco foam products co mobil corp jenpak and 
huntsman chemical 
amoco foam president john giroux said 10 percent of his 
companys polystyrene sales were to mcdonalds 
first to go will be the plastic foam sandwich boxes which will 
be replaced by paper products manufactured in a new process that 
will preserve the foods temperature and freshness rensi said 
the company is still trying to determine suitable replacements 
for plastic cutlery and the plastic cups in which coffee is served 
he said

the turmoil in the persian gulf which has 
taken its toll on the us economy by sending oil prices skyward 
now threatens to worsen the nations unemployment problems 
analysts say 
the fallout from iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait has left 
american businesses skittish about adding employees according to 
private economists 
theres a buttoning up of the overcoats going on said 
robert dederick chief economist at the northern trust co of 
chicago 
iraqs continued occupation of kuwait and the threat of war 
does not make one anxiously go out and hire people dederick 
said 
analysts will get their first comprehensive look at the nations 
economic activity for october with todays release of the labor 
departments unemployment figures for last month 
in advance of the report many analysts predicted the jobless 
rate inched up from 57 percent to 58 percent in october or 
possibly even up to 59 percent 
if the unemployment rate did climb last month it would mark the 
fourth straight monthly increase the nation has not suffered four 
consecutive jumps in the jobless rate since 1982 
although government data indicates the us economy grew at a 
slow annual rate of 18 percent in the third quarter of 1990 many 
analysts contend the nation slipped into a recession at the tail 
end of the julyseptember period or the start of the current fourth 
quarter 
the recent rise in unemployment before the jobless rate began 
going up in july it had been holding steady for months at 53 
percent just offers more evidence of a downturn analysts said 
whats happening is the economy is rolling into a mild 
recession dederick said 
a jobless rate of 58 percent would mark a threeyear high the 
largest level since it reached that level in november 1987 
many analysts expected the labor departments report to probably 
show that the nations industries lost about 75000 jobs in 
october a far cry from the 200000 new jobs the economy was adding 
each month last year 
the nations manufacturing sector which has been in a slump for 
months was expected to continue its slide in october economic 
weakness probably continued to spread to the service sector as 
well analysts said they noted that the only area in the us 
economy that has been booming recently is the health care industry 
which has been adding about 50000 jobs a month 
david jones chief economist at aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said business leaders concerns 
intensified after the aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq 
but jones noted that the nations economy had been staggering 
for months well before the middle east erupted we were clearly 
slipping gradually into recession even before the oil price 
shock he said 
just in the last week citicorp general dynamics aetna and 
general motors announced layoffs and many economists said it could 
be the start of widespread job cuts as the economy continues to

many analysts say the only reason the unemployment rate had

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge dropped 08 percent in september the government said today 
for its second straight monthly drop 
the september drop followed a 12 percent plunge in august the 
steepest since a 14 percent fall a month after the october 1987 
stock market crash the index was unchanged in july 
three consecutive declines in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators are viewed as a fairly reliable 
although not infallible sign that a recession is imminent 
in another report the government said the unemployment rate 
held at 57 percent in october even though the nations 
manufacturing and construction industries continued to slump the 
index of leading indicators lags a month behind the unemployment 
report 
although last months civilian jobless rate was unchanged from 
septembers 57 percent the labor department said the nations job 
market continued to show weakness and widespread job losses 
there has not been a recession since world war ii without the 
index of leading indicators turning down for at least three 
consecutive months however the index was negative for six months 
in 1984 and for five months in 198788 and both times the economy 
escaped a recession 
many economists who believe the nations economy is in a 
recession are now debating how long it will last and how severe it 
will be 
even those analysts who say the economy still can skirt a 
recession generally agree the current quarter is in a contraction 
a recession generally is defined as two straight quarters of 
negative growth 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its broadest measure of economic activity 
nine of the forwardlooking indicators pulled the index down in 
september 
they were lower stock prices a decrease in orders for consumer 
goods an increase in weekly unemployment claims a decline in 
building permits a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence 
a decrease in unfilled orders a lower money supply faster 
business delivery times and a decline in the price of raw 
materials 
the only positive contributor was an increase in orders for new 
plants and equipment 
one indicator the average workweek was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1433 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and down 11 percent from its level a year ago 
many analysts who contend a recession will be avoided still 
express concern the economy may have weakened during the current 
quarter 
michael boskin chairman of president bushs council of economic 
advisers said earlier this week that we are concerned about a 
sluggish fourth quarter and the early part of 1991 
stephen s roach senior economist at morgan stanley amp co of 
new york believes the economy will avoid a recession although he 
projects a decline in growth during the current quarter 
however he added we are not projecting two consecutive 
quarters of declining gnp the generally accepted definition of 
a recession 
roger brinner chief economist with drimcgrawhill in 
lexington mass said he expects a recession starting in the 
current quarter with an economic recovery in the second half of 
1991 
michael k evans of evans economics inc in washington said a 
recession will be shallow but extended with growth remaining 
near zero throughout 1991 
on the other hand a survey of 52 economists by the publication 
blue chip economic indicators showed a consensus believed the 
economy will decline 06 percent this quarter and 01 percent in 
the first quarter of 1991 the consensus then projected the economy 
to edge up 12 percent in the second quarter and 23 percent and 
26 percent in the next two 
economists with regional financial associates in west chester 
pa said they expect the current recession to be mild in 
comparison to other postwar recessions the contraction is 
estimated to have begun in august and to end in march 1991 a total 
of eight months 
this is significantly shorter than the 11month average length 
of the six previous postwar recessions they wrote in their 
regional financial review 
but a study for the economic policy institute a liberal think 
tank financed partly by labor unions contends the next recession 
will be longer and deeper than normally would be expected due in 
large part to consumers heavy debt 
this will cause consumers to cut back spending even more sharply 
than they otherwise would and thus deepen the contraction said the 
study by robert pollin an economist at the university of 
californiariverside

plants moves that will idle more than 27000 workers 
ford motor co meanwhile will temporarily lay off about 10600 
workers as it shuts down five car and truck assembly plants because 
of slow sales 
chrysler corp is holding production relatively even and has 
announced no layoffs or temporary shutdowns for the current 
quarter 
the cuts in fourthquarter auto production come in the wake of 
pessimistic economic forecasts early october sales were stronger 
than predicted but automakers are wary 
it doesnt look like sales are falling off the cliff but 
dealers are afraid of carrying big inventories said david healy 
an auto analyst with barclays de zoete wedd investment banking 
group in new york 
the gm cuts are the most extensive by the nations largest 
automaker since last winter all three of the companys vehicle 
groups announced temporary shutdowns 
nineteen of the 29 gm plants in the united states and canada 
will be affected by the cuts between now and christmas 
layoffs began monday at plants belonging to gms truck amp bus 
group with the shutdown of two assembly lines in flint second 
shift production at the flint 2 line will end in early january 
idling more than 1700 workers indefinitely 
the pontiac east truck assembly plant as well as plants in 
moraine ohio and fort wayne ind will shut down temporarily 
next monday 
gms chevroletpontiaccanada group also is shutting the 
corvette assembly plant in bowling green ky for two weeks 
starting monday and will reduce production at the plant when the 
workers return nov 19 plants in tarrytown ny oklahoma city 
okla arlington texas and van nuys calif also will close for 
two weeks beginning monday

approximately 450 workers by reducing the speed of the assembly 
line following the temporary shutdown

month and will cut production at a truck plant in oshawa ontario 
by 13 percent in early december

eurotunnel the anglofrench consortium which is 
digging a rail tunnel beneath the english channel announced friday 
it hopes to raise 532 million pounds or about 104 billion after 
expenses through the sale of new shares to existing shareholders 
the company set the price of each share at 285 pence or 556 
it plans to offer nearly 200 million new shares there are 3324 
million shares already outstanding 
the proposed sale price is 34 percent below eurotunnels current 
price per share of 430 pence or 836 on londons stock market 
the new shares will begin trading on londons stock exchange 
the paris bourse and the brussels stock exchange on nov 12 the 
company said 
existing shareholders will be eligible to buy three new shares 
for every five they already own eurotunnel said it is also 
offering a range of travel perquisites including limited free 
travel to encourage share purchases 
the tunnel is scheduled to open in 1993 but the company 
projected no dividends until 1999 
details of the share offer were released three days after 
drillers in one of the projects three tunnels broke through from 
the british side to the french side 
the success of the share sale with investors is a condition for 
the release of an additional 41 billion in loans agreed to by 
banks which already have put up 98 billion 
the sale has been fully underwritten by a group of british 
american and french financial institutions eurotunnel said 
the consortium previously raised 102 billion pounds or 2 
billion through the sale of stock 
the 31mile rail tunnel between folkestone england and calais 
france needs the extra funds because of a 60 percent jump in its 
costs mostly because the rolling stock turned out to be much more 
expensive than expected 
the tunnel now is expected to cost 761 billion pounds or 148 
billion up sharply from the initial estimate of 487 billion 
pounds in 1986 
this weeks breakthrough occurred in the projects service 
tunnel and the first meeting on the two major tunnels should occur 
next year 
when eurotunnel opens in june 1993 it will carry passengers 
cars and freight between london and paris in three hours half the 
carferry journey time it expects to transport 28 million people 
in the first year

all of the major creditor constituencies are on board and 
ready to approve the revised plan of reorganization said robert 
sable an attorney who represented wheelingpittsburghs unsecured 
creditors 
an original plan of reorganization had to be revised to account 
for added costs related to a labor contract the company agreed to 
earlier this year 
when the case concludes more than 700 million in claims 
against wheelingpittsburgh will have been settled 
the company was helped significantly by changes that occurred 
during the years it was under court protection 
it was helped by circumstances a revival of the economy a 
revival of the steel business and primarily a reduction in 
industrywide capacity sable said the creditors were patient 
and worked it out 
sable said unsecured claims were being sold in 1985 for 12 cents

japan is shifting the focus of its technological 
prowess from economic growth to a higher quality of life the 
government says in an annual assessment that provides some insight 
into the nations selfimage 
the science and technology agencys report released in october 
emphasizes that japan has matured into a leading economic giant 
producing 14 percent of the worlds goods and services largely due 
to scientific and technological achievements 
the report also emphasizes that much of the progress japan 
engendered is enjoyed abroad instead of home where millions of 
japanese historically have scrimped and saved 
but now the report says the peoples consciousness has been 
transformed in the midst of this economic prosperity and they now 
wish to live their lives in comfort and fulfillment 
it says japan still lags far behind europe and the united states 
in areas of technology related to housing as well as facilities 
for elderly and handicapped people 
robert broadfoot managing director of political and economic 
risk consultancy in hong kong said japanese are strongly aware of 
the gap in quality of life between their nation and countries like 
the united states despite japans wealth 
money doesnt mean that much now with the possibility of 
rapid market fluctuations but quality of life is something real 
he said in a telephone interview 
nobuaki teraoka an aide at the science and technology agencys 
policy bureau said until now the use of science and technology 
in japan has emphasized pursuit of economic development but now we 
are at the point where we need to shift our focus to the pursuit of 
fuller lives 
the annual report said japan spent about 285 percent of its 
gross national product on research and development last year 
slightly below west germanys 287 percent united states spending 
dropped to an estimated 253 percent of gnp it said 
the report said japan spent 98 trillion yen or 77 billion on 
research and development in 1989 an increase of 46 percent in real 
terms over the previous five years including research on 
humanities and social sciences the total was 106 trillion yen or 
83 billion 
despite the image overseas of large japanese government 
subsidies for technological research public funding once again 
provided a far smaller portion of japans total research and 
development expenses in 1989 than in other major nations 
of total research spending the report said only 199 percent 
was governmentfunded vs 474 percent in the united states and 
332 percent in west germany 
instead the very extensive research effort by private 
companies has resulted in technological progress that accounted 
for twofifths of japans economic growth during the past 10 years 
said yoshiki kurihara director of the policy bureaus research 
division 
the report called for more government spending particularly for 
basic research that private industry can rarely undertake because 
it is either extremely risky or requires a big investment in time 
in 1989 japan had 462000 researchers 535000 including 
humanities and social sciences a 25 percent increase from five 
years earlier in the sciences 294000 worked for private 
industry 132000 for universities and 36000 for government 
research institutes 
it said the united states had about 806000 researchers and west 
germany 166000 including those in humanities and social sciences

the bottlers of bubbly perrier water reported 
friday that net profits more than doubled in the first half of 1990 
despite a worldwide recall after dangerous chemicals turned up in 
some samples 
the profit increase came mostly from the sale of the groups 
softdrink operations source perrier sa said 
firsthalf volume sales of the popular mineral water were down 
14 percent from 1989 and revenue slipped 3 percent due to the 
recall and delays in restocking the beverage source perrier said 
consolidated net profits amounted to 856 million francs or 167 
million up from 397 million francs a year earlier 
revenue for the first half fell to 8302 billion francs or 
162 billion compared with 8541 billion francs in 1989 
the latest results included a gain on the sale of its softdrink 
operations as the company shifted its focus back to the 
greenbottled mineral water 
the us food and drug administration discovered traces of the 
cancercausing chemical benzene in bottles of perrier in january 
leading to a recall of millions of bottles worldwide 
perrier said the contamination occurred from a dirty filter on a 
gas line at the spring in vergeze southern france 
the discovery that perrier added gas to boost the waters 
natural fizz forced the company to drop claims on its labels that 
the water sparkled naturally 
benzenefree perrier went back on the shelves in the united 
states and europe by midapril 
the sale of the softdrinks unit and other nonstrategic assets 
for 1 billion francs or 195 million more than offset the cost of 
the recall the statement said 
perrier did not list the recall costs but specified that a 
provision of 435 million francs or 85 million was set aside for 
it in the 1989 accounts

higher taxes are making taxexempt mutual funds 
more popular as investors move past big credittroubled municipal 
issuers like massachussetts new york city and philadelphia 
bolstered by the new tax law that gives few income tax breaks 
and higher rates more investors seeking highquality municipal 
debt issuers are putting money in taxfree mutual funds 
with higher taxes their reasons are obvious 
a tax free bond fund that yields 7 percent has a taxequivalent 
yield of 97 percent for an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket 
but if that investor lands into the new 31 percent bracket the tax 
equivalent yield on the same 7 percent fund rises to 101 percent 
that kind of math may be popular among investors who have become 
wary of the highrisk doubledigit yeilds of the junk bond funds 
it is clear that demand for municipal bonds will be strong 
enough to make taxexempts the most stable as well as the most 
attractive investments in todays market said siesel e 
canaday jr vice president of municipal underwriting at john 
nuveen amp co inc an investment banking firm 
some bond funds are reporting brisker sales of the taxexempts 
at vanguard group in valley forge pa municipal mutual funds 
net cash inflow increased sevenfold in october over september said 
brian mattes a spokesman some of that he said may be a result 
of investors anticipating tax increases 
fidelity investments says net inflows are running at the highest 
levels this year comparable to the peak season following the tax 
return deadline 
theyre reacting to threats of increasing taxes on federal 
level and on state level as well said heidi baxter marketing 
manager of fidelitys state taxfree funds 
despite the horror stories about credit problems in the 
northeast and fears that a recession would strike cities and states 
particularly hard investors have been willing to invest in the 
municipal market when they can find quality 
if people are looking for quality they have the opportunity to 
still earn very attractive yeilds quality is a consideration you 
just have to be more selective ms baxter said 
but as a result of their popularity the taxfree funds main 
attraction may be diminished increased demand coming at a time of 
relatively short supply will likely bid up the price of municipal 
bonds causing yields to fall 
helped by the higher tax bracket the municipals have quite a 
way to go before their taxequivalent yields fall into the range of 
most lowrisk taxable investments 
for now though the yields are there and the bond funds are 
ready 
the increased business could be a good sign for an industry that 
has been sagging since the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the investment company institute reported last week that total 
sales of longterm municipal funds including reinvested dividends 
fell 2753 million from august to 9682 million in september 
at oppenheimer where officials are discussing advertising their 
taxfree funds more sam friedman president of oppenheimer 
shareholder services said nobody wants to get too excited until 
the federal budget agreement is signed 
a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon although i think 
its a good bandwagon to get on he said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
friday on the chicago board of trade soybeans sold off late in the 
session amid disappointment that president bush did not announce 
export credits to the soviet union 
wheat futures ended moderately higher while corn futures rose 
slightly 
the soybean market rallied early extending thursdays gains on 
speculation that president bush would announce export credits to 
the soviets during a campaign swing through the midwest on friday 
some analysts reasoned that bush might announce the credits 
which would allow moscow to buy us grain and soybeans to help 
boost the chances of republican candidates from the midwestern farm 
states 
but the president made no mention of export credits on his swing 
through the region prompting disappointed selling of soybean 
futures analysts said 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 4 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 266 a bushel corn 
was cent to 2 cents higher with december at 230 a bushel oats

soaring fuel costs could force financially 
strapped continental airlines to sell some international routes and 
prompt layoffs if the carrier wants to avoid another round of 
bankruptcy reorganization its president said 
one plan under consideration is the sale of continentals air 
micronesia the carriers pacific service operated from its hub in 
guam air micronesia holds the authority to fly from honolulu to 
tokyo 
that is worth doing if it allows us to continue with a viable 
airline continental president hollis harris said thursday in an 
appearance before a group of houston businessmen 
such a sale could mean the end of continentals 
houstonhonolulutokyo route continental still would have the 
ability to fly to honolulu but the most lucrative leg of the trip 
is from honolulu to japan 
continental began tokyo service just four months ago after a 
24year effort to get direct air access between houston and japan 
officials at delta airlines harris former employer have 
confirmed they are looking at some assets continental has for sale 
but wont say what kind of deal the atlantabased carrier is 
interested in pursuing 
harris who recently took over at continental said layoffs were 
possible but he hoped such moves as well as cuts in wages and 
benefits could be avoided 
a 20 percent cut in salaries would save about 16 million a 
month harris however said the savings would not be worth the 
toll on employees 
their morale would just go down the drain he said they 
would be so depressed wed run off more revenue than we would 
save 
analysts note continental which employs 37000 nationwide 
already has low labor costs 
according to my cash flow work they need to sell assets to 
provide a cushion large enough to not have liquidity problems 
said paul karos an analyst with first boston corp 
continental already is negotiating the sale of its houston 
airline food service operation chelsea catering which employs 800 
at its houston kitchen 
on friday continental and dallasbased electronic data systems 
broke off talks on a multibilliondollar deal through which the 
airline would have relinquished control of its computerized 
reservation system 
one reason cited was the increase in fuel prices caused by 
uncertainty in the middle east 
last week continentals board of directors faced with monthly 
fuel bills that have risen 70 million since july considered 
filing for bankruptcy protection continental previously filed for 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws in 1983 
instead directors opted to sell off assets and undertake 
whatever measures necessary to remain afloat 
harris said airlines need an additional 10 percent increase in 
ticket prices to offset the jump in fuel costs but he doesnt 
think the flying public would tolerate such increases

bargain prices and generous inducements will be 
the keys to success for 10 billion worth of securities the 
government and eurotunnel are trying to sell in a jittery market 
eurotunnel is asking shareholders who already have bought 2 
billion worth of stock to take up another 1 billion to ensure 
completion of a rail tunnel beneath the english channel 
meanwhile the government is about to sell britains 12 regional 
electricity distribution companies for an expected 4 billion to 5 
billion pounds or 78 billion to 98 billion its the biggest 
and most complex privatization yet and has been in the works for 
months 
incentives have been offered for both eurotunnel announced 
friday it would sell the extra stock at 285 pence 556 each an 
unusually large 34 percent discount to the market price it also 
offered perks such as free travel through the tunnel for 49 years 
for those who buy at least 1500 shares 
analysts said the discount demonstrates the anglofrench 
consortiums fear that shareholders might reject the stock when it 
starts trading nov 12 
the government meantime is including a twoyear installment 
plan among its inducements for the privatization whose price will 
be announced nov 21 the government has also begun an aggressive 
marketing drive that includes television advertisements 
such perks are necessary given the uncertainty surrounding the 
london market said anthony winnington director of equity sales at 
the london investment firm hoare govett ltd 
the persian gulf crisis low corporate earnings a faltering 
british economy and political turmoil in prime minister margaret 
thatchers government have been blamed for the markets jitters 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index has fallen 384 
points since midjuly 
the appetite with cashrich institutions for new equity even 
at a discount at the market is not terribly strong because of the 
uncertainty in the middle east and the threat we could see a 
200point drop in prices overnight winnington said 
i think the government has to make sure that the electricity 
issue is priced low enough to assure success on the london 
market said richard jeffrey an economist with hoare govett 
the governments 64 billion worth of privatizations over the 
years have been largely successful with the exception of the 
governments remaining onethird stake in british petroleum co 
plc 
the bp sale coincided with the october 1987 stock market crash 
and flopped 
at a news conference friday energy secretary john wakeham 
denied that the government was giving away the electricity 
companies 
but ernie mcknight a british equity manager for glasgowbased 
scottish amicable investment managers said that since the 
government wants to sell off the electricity generating companies 
next year they cant afford to fail 
if the gulf situation escalates i think the market reaction 
will be negative and its obviously more difficult to place large 
quantities of stock in a falling market he said 
the stakes are high for eurotunnel too the sales success with 
shareholders is a condition for the release of an additional 41 
billion in loans by banks 
the 50mile tunnel which is to open in 1993 needs the extra 
funds because of a nearly 60 percent jump in its overall cost to 
761 billion pounds or 148 billion 
eurotunnel deputy chairman alastair morton said earlier this 
week that the sale had been timed to coincide with tuesday nights 
confidenceinspiring breakthrough by diggers on the first of the 
projects three tunnels 
optimistic about the sale he noted that eurotunnels offer 
comes before the governments 
the governments says 6 million people have registered to buy 
electricity shares and the eurotunnel sale is fully underwritten 
by investment firms 
but many recent issues have been left in the hands of 
underwriters and not many companies have been trying to sell new 
stock for months winnington said 
institutional investors held some 29 billion pounds 57 
billion in cash in the third quarter compared with 22 billion 
pounds 43 billion a year ago jeffrey said sales of new stock 
have fallen to 660 million pounds 13 billion from 16 billion 
pounds 31 billion he said

publication of the marketer and is seeking a buyer for the monthly 
magazine for senior marketing executives that was launched only 
this past april

the move reflects te parent companys decision to deemphasize 
magazine publishing and focus resources on its other businesses 
tv stations production of tv shows and theater operations 
act iii communications based in los angeles is privately held 
and headed by television producer norman lear best known for the 
classic tv series all in the family it owns eight tv stations 
and about 550 movie screens

adweek magazine bpi an affiliate of the owner of the boston 
globe said it planned to make the magazine a weekly starting next 
year

channels which appears every other week and covers the television 
industry the music industry monthlies mix and electronic musician 
and the international television magazines television business

was not commenting on it but added that the company was making 
selective decisions as we go along here 
the marketer will be suspended after the november issue which 
appears nov 7 the company said negotiations are ongoing with 
several potential buyers of the publication and that an 
announcement is expected shortly 
gardner declined to identify any potential buyers or say how 
many there were but said chances for a sale of the magazine are 
extremely good 
the marketer was sent free to 45000 senior marketing 
executives and gardner said it was doing very well for a 
startup magazine 
it had employed about a dozen editorial and advertising 
staffers 
the suspension of the magazine comes amid what many analysts are 
calling an advertising recession in the publishing business ad 
volume has slumped at many magazines and several magazines have 
halted publication 
this week alone knightridder inc said it was ceasing 
publication of runways a news magazine devoted to the commercial 
aviation industry and goldhirsh group suspended publication of 
business month magazine a business news and feature magazine whose 
roots extended to 1893

british prime minister margaret 
thatcher was furious 
she demanded to know how the european community could map out 
grandiose schemes to become a united states of europe when it 
couldnt even end an impasse over reducing government farm payments 
in world trade talks 
it is very urgent indeed because if we do not get agreement on 
agriculture it will give a signal to the world that the community 
is protectionist she said at a recent summit of the 12 trading 
bloc nations 
the nearly monthold dispute pitting britain against france and 
germany has threatened the collapse of the uruguay round 
negotiations an ambitious fouryear effort to lower trade barriers 
in about 100 nations and give a hefty boost to the worlds economy 
in the next century 
its jeopardizing the success of the trade talks said anna 
murphy research fellow at the brusselsbased center for european 
policy studies 
agriculture is only one of 15 areas under discussion in the 
trade negotiations which began in 1986 in the uruguayan resort of 
punta del este 
but the united states australia argentina and others insist it 
holds the key to expanding trade in other areas including 
textiles manufactured goods and services such as 
telecommunications and banking some nations threaten to quit if 
nothing is done on agriculture 
jeffrey schott research fellow at the institute of 
international economics in washington said the ec is isolated in 
its seeming unwillingness to reduce subsidies 
the final round of negotiations begins in just four weeks 
yet the community has not submitted its farm offer for 
bargaining in the talks held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and an accord for freer 
world trade 
its member nations have been unable to endorse a proposal to 
trim subsidies on major farm crops by 30 percent over 10 years 
starting in 1986 some reductions already have been made so 
analysts estimate cuts in the coming years would amount to 10 
percent to 15 percent 
agriculture and trade ministers of the community nations will 
meet monday in a seventh attempt to back the plan 
but schott said even if it were to be approved by the 
ministers it would be dead on arrival 
other nations including the united states have dismissed the 
proposed reductions as insufficient 
what worries the united states and other nations is that the 
community wont go any further than that and that isnt enough as 
far as theyre concerned said ms murphy 
the bush administration asked trading partners to slash farm 
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent 
over a 10year period starting in 1991 
andre herlitska secretarygeneral of the european farm lobby 
copa thinks that there is a big part of bluff in the american 
proposal 
the united states contends it wants to put agriculture trade on 
a more freemarket footing 
we must let farmers compete with farmers instead of farmers 
competing with the deep pockets of government treasuries 
president bush said recently 
european farmers are skeptical 
we dont believe blind market forces are the best instruments 
to ensure market stability said herlitska 
farm assistance is costly 
industrialized nations spent 251 billion on agricultural 
subsidies last year the organization for economic cooperation and 
development has estimated of that the european community spend 
975 billion and the united states spent 672 billion 
the community has pared its support programs in recent years 
making the prospect of further trims unpalatable to its 10 million 
farmers more than three times as many as in the united states 
german chancellor helmut kohl who faces his nations 1 million 
farmers in elections on dec 2 has said the communitys proposal 
goes too far he wants compensatory measures to offset any income 
losses to farmers 
france where 22 million farmers produce much of the 
communitys agriculture exports has balked at any move to snip 
export aids which enable the europeans to sell highpriced goods 
on the world markets 
it also wants to maintain a system of taxes and other measures 
that encourage trading bloc nations to shun imports and buy 
homegrown crops 
farmers complain they have been hit hard in recent years by poor 
prices government limits on production bad weather food safety 
scares and a flood of cheap products from eastern europe 
there is a trend toward declining income the situation is 
very bad said herlitska 
farmers have sometimes turned to violence to underscore their 
complaints 
in france demonstrators this fall hijacked livestock trucks 
mostly from britain and slaughtered the animals inside 
french president francois mitterrand was forced to cancel an 
inaugural ride on a new stretch of highspeed rail track when 
farmers barricaded the line 
kohl was booed by several thousand farmers at a recent campaign 
rally he professed to have much understanding for your worries 
and promised budget measures to do something about shrinking 
pocketbooks 
despite these pressures the community disputes its image as the 
bad guy in the uruguay round and insists it wants the n0153

chicagos futures exchanges have agreed to help guide the 
development of the moscow commodities exchange making the leaders 
of the chicago markets not unlike surgeons performing an organ 
transplant 
their mission to transfer to the soviet union the market 
concepts and trading techniques that make visitors to the floors of 
the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange feel 
that they are walking through the beating heart of capitalism 
the operation wont be easy the moscow exchange started in 
may reportedly runs in fits and starts opening the trading floor 
only when enough commodities have been brought to market to justify 
a session 
the chicago tribune reported that during this past weeks visit 
to the moscow market by chicago exchange officials the goods on 
the block included 2000 tons of russian cement a shipment of 
japanese videotapes and radiotelephones and a few million winston 
cigarettes 
the products were auctioned off by an exchange officer to 
traders who stood around him in a circle and shyly raised their 
hands to signal their acceptance of an offer the tribune reported 
that scene is a far cry from the chicago trading floors where 
traders crowd into specially constructed pits and deal directly 
with each other by shouting out bids and offers and gesturing 
furiously in a deafening and seemingly chaotic maelstrom 
but the object of the chicago and moscow commodity markets is 
the same to provide a place for buyers and sellers to come 
together and set the prices of goods 
like the moscow exchange the chicago exchanges began as markets 
for physical commodities farmers actually brought their grain to 
the chicago board of trade to sell 
but after 140 years chicagos exchanges have evolved into 
futures markets where traders exchange contracts that represent the 
commodities the system also allows the exchanges to offer an 
everwidening array financial products such as government bond and 
stockindex futures 
the moscow exchange is close to where the chicago board of trade 
was in 1948 which is why the moscow market officials looked to 
chicago for assistance in creating an exchange that will help push 
the soviet union toward a market economy and away from one in which 
prices are set by the government 
the creation of a moscow futures market also could help open the 
soviet union up further as a market for us products 
in documents signed thursday and friday the board of trade and 
chicago merc agreed to provide educational and research support to 
the moscow commodities exchange 
we are honored to be playing so significant a role in this 
historic undertaking said leo melamed chairman of the mercs 
executive committee in a statement 
while the process of moving from a controlled economy and 
fixed exchange rates to a free economy based on supply and demand 
is difficult and will take a protracted period of time the 
contributions of commodity markets toward this process will be 
significant 
board of trade president thomas donovan said the moscow 
exchange like the chicago markets arose out of a need for more 
efficient allocation of basic commodities 
over a span of some 20 years in the mid19th century the 
chicago board of trade developed the most efficient system ever 
the futures market we will see it happen again in the soviet 
union donovan said

hopes for lower interest rates provided the 
spark for a broad advance in stock prices today 
analysts found no big surprises in two government reports this 
morning that showed new signs of weakness in the economy 
the labor department reported that nonfarm payroll employment 
dropped 68000 last month although the civilian unemployment rate 
held steady at 57 percent 
separately the commerce department said its index of leading 
economic indicators fell 08 percent in september on top of a 12 
percent drop the month before 
such evidence of a recession continues to drag down corporate 
earnings estimates in the financial world but it has also stirred 
talk that the federal reserve might soon step up its efforts to 
ease credit conditions

as the persian gulf crisis turned three months 
old friday oil prices fell a little more than 1 a barrel in a 
weary futures market that traders said has lost its enthusiasm for 
going wild on news and rumors 
theyre not looking at every headline now and saying buy 
because saddam said this said thomas p blakeslee an energy 
analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
theyre waiting for something real 
light sweet crude oil for december delivery closed at 34 per 
barrel down 117 on the new york mercantile exchange contracts 
for delivery in later months also settled lower 
for the week crude for nearterm delivery rose 99 cents oil 
traders said it has been by far the slowest week they have seen 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
youre in a very narrow range on very light volume said 
trader ed kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc 
analysts attributed fridays drop to perceptions that president 
bushs latest comments about iraqi president saddam hussein were 
softer than a day earlier 
bush has been attacking saddam sharply most of the week but 
traders have paid little attention because the comments have come 
on the campaign trail where the president is stumping for 
republicans running in tuesdays elections 
if hes out there campaigning and hes down in florida can he 
really start a war from there blakeslee said 
petroleum products also fell friday 
unleaded gasoline dropped 309 cents to 8921 cents per gallon 
for december delivery with later months also down the nearterm 
contract finished the week down 226 cents 
home heating oil fell 295 cents to 8742 cents a gallon for 
december delivery later contract months were all lower for the 
week heating oil dropped 83 cent 
natural gas for december delivery settled at 2358 per 1000 
cubic feet friday up 8 cent from thursday

the shaky economy caused chrysler corp and fiat 
spa to call off months of talks about possible joint ventures or 
other business arrangements the no 3 us automaker and the 
italian company said friday 
uncertainties in the global economy rising oil prices brought 
on by the crisis in the gulf the slowdown in sales in both the 
us and european automotive markets and the overall deterioration 
in worldwide business conditions created overwhelming obstacles 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca said 
today we have to realize that the world economic scenario is 
plagued with uncertainty and that synergies and mutual advantages 
cannot be pursued said giovanni agnelli chairman of fiat group 
rumors of talks between the two automakers had been swirling 
since june although chrysler and fiat declined to comment until 
iacocca confirmed in august that the two companies were 
negotiating 
we discovered some strong potential opportunities for working 
together and some outstanding operational synergies that could have 
benefited both companies iacocca recalled on friday 
speculation had run the gamut from fiat buying a large share of 
chrysler to an agreement to cooperate on a small sportutility 
vehicle 
fiat spokesman gualberto ranieri confirmed on friday that 
discussions included potential production agreements commercial 
and distribution arrangements and equity investments 
but the companies concluded that the time wasnt right he said 
chrysler reported dismal thirdquarter results on monday a 
214 million loss on revenues of 65 billion 
the loss however was expected and mary ann sudol an analyst 
with fitch investors service inc of new york instead blamed world 
economic uncertainty for scuttling the talks 
with the war in the mideast that could affect oil and gasoline 
prices and the murky geopolitical and economic situation they 
might end up regretting any capital commitment particularly if it 
were going to be very product specific sudol said 
she said the companies earlier had ruled out a possible equity 
investment in chrysler by fiat but had refused to elaborate further 
on the talks they really kept the lid on she said 
ranieri did not rule out a resumption of talks if world economic 
conditions stabilize everything is possible he said 
the companies said they would continue their existing business 
arrangements including some component deals and chryslers 
marketing of alfa romeo cars in north america 
chrysler stock closed up 37 cents friday on the new york stock 
exchange at 1137 per share

for these economists the picture always is 
bright out of this world you might say thats because when it 
comes to business astroeconomists turn to the stars 
they look at the rise of the moon gravitational forces of venus 
and jupiter and earths tidal flows and weather patterns to 
forecast the future of economic trends ranging from unemployment to 
gold prices 
spacey 
not to these high rollers er astroeconomists 
this weekend about 150 of them are in chicago for the third 
annual world conference on astroeconomics 
say what 
when most people hear about astroeconomics they go 
what robert hand creator of a computer program overlaying 
star charts with stock market fluctuations said friday 
i think that there is a great deal of incredulity he said 
but the proof is in the pudding in that people who use it make 
money 
among the lecture topics at the conference for which each 
attendee paid 170 geocosmic and rhythmic cycles in todays 
precious metals markets astrological technical analysis and 
hot stocks for the coming year 
over the coming months hand said he foresees a bottoming out 
in the stock market and recessionlike trends 
critics might argue it doesnt take a rocket scientist to 
predict such events 
take for example robert eisner a william r kenan professor 
of economics at northwestern university in evanston he calls 
astroeconomics garbage unequivocally 
unless you have some theory about how stars relate to economic 
activity and im not aware of any good one its 
inconceivable eisner said 
of course the stars will do no worse on average will do 
about the same and sometimes will do better on wall street than 
any speculating would 
still hand insists that to predict the economic future within 
80 percent to 90 percent certainty proves the practice works 
grace morris an astrologer and psychoanalyst who cosponsored 
the weekend conference in chicago defended the pseudoscience 
she said skeptics should note astrology predicted iraqs 
invasion of kuwait precipitated by a lunar eclipse a 
stresscausing event on any planet 
morris said she uses astrology to advise businesses on the 
proper timing for startups new product introductions and corporate 
takeovers 
virgo companies like texaco and cocacola will do very well in 
late 1991 she said jupiter will move into virgo after 
september of 1991 and jupiter symbolizes the expansion of 
business 
astrology has been a subject of fascination for years studied 
by us presidents beginning with george washington and thomas 
jefferson and more recently by nancy reagan for setting her 
husbands schedule 
so its only natural that it take on financial applications 
said elizabeth gauerke who analyzes weather cycles to predict 
events 
in the history of the world money and the planets have always 
been tied up she said the market is not predictable but what 
planets do is its a simple formula that works for a lot of 
people

in the midst of hard times for many borrowers 
the biggest credit junkie of all comes to wall street this week to 
ask for a recordsized loan 
and there is little doubt he will get his money with a minimum 
of fuss lenders in fact may be so eager to oblige him that they 
will offer him a break on the interest rate 
the party with the oustretched hand is the us treasury which 
plans to solicit 3425 billion through the sale over a threeday 
span from tuesday through thursday of notes and bonds 
more often than not in recent years these quarterly 
refundings by the government have been greeted with trepidation 
by traders in the stock and bond markets 
the nagging fear keeps recurring that one day they will hold a 
treasury auction and many of the usual bidders simply wont show 
up 
this time however such talk has been all but stilled instead 
some observers say a developing credit crunch in many sectors of 
the economy may actually have enhanced the market for paper floated 
by uncle sam 
as jack lavery director of global research at merrill lynch put 
it recently increased concern about credit quality has sparked 
greater domestic demand for treasury issues even though foreign 
demand appears to be drying up 
the treasury has long ranked as one of the worlds best credit 
risks supported by a vast store of national resources and assets 
and by its powers to tax and to print money so what if its 
checkbook has been chronically out of balance for the last 20 
years 
demand at the refunding is also expected to be bolstered by 
spreading weakness in the economy and expectations that the federal 
reserve might soon take further steps to relax its credit policy 
both those forces traditionally work in the direction of lower 
interest rates 
so as the treasury outlined its borrowing plans in the past 
week stock prices managed to gain ground the dow jones average of 
30 industrials rose 5470 points to 249084 
the new york stock exchange composite index climbed 336 to 
17007 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 209 to 33645 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 141 at 28998 
volume on the big board averaged 15429 million shares a day 
against 14398 million the week before 
even if interest rates decline in the markets for treasury debt 
analysts caution that it wont necessarily become easier and 
cheapier for everybody to borrow money 
holding companies of some of the nations biggest banks now have 
to pay astronomical returns to attract and keep capital from 
investors 
the banks in turn have grown increasingly stringent in the 
standards they apply to customers who seek loans 
elsewhere the story is much the same in the market for 
shortterm interestbearing securities for instance money market 
mutual funds which sit on a 400 billionplus pile of lendable 
cash are still reported to be narrowing the scope of the risks 
they will take 
as more and more of the investment world is driven into the 
little corral of treasury bills quality spreads must inevitably 
widen says james grant in his biweekly grants interest rate 
observer 
in a summarizing comment he adds in the contraction phase of 
the credit cycle trouble begins at the fringe and worms its way 
into the core 
it begins with the thrifts and ends with the banks some of 
which were thought to be above it it tests all financial 
structures the way salt water finds every unpainted crevice aboard 
a ship

precious metal futures prices fell sharply friday led by a drop 
of more than 15 an ounce in the price of platinum amid heavy 
japanese selling 
on other commodity markets oil prices tumbled livestock and 
meat futures were mixed and grains and soybeans were mixed 
platinum futures settled 1510 to 1590 lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the spot price at 41660 and the actively 
traded contract for january delivery at 42060 a troy ounce 
gold finished 510 to 550 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with december at 37780 a troy ounce silver was 71 
cents to 78 cents lower with december at 4185 a troy ounce 
the selloff wiped out most of the gains registered in the 
precious metals complex earlier in the week 
analysts said lower japanese stock prices and weak us economic 
data prompted heavy selling of platinum on perceptions that 
industrial demand for the metal will decline as economic conditions 
worsen 
a good part of the selling was coming from the japanese 
said don tierney metals analyst with fortune commodities inc 
whenever their stock market falls off theyve got to sell some 
of their platinum to lighten up on their holdings 
some observers also cited fridays sharp drop in oil prices 
which eased inflationary pressures 
and several analysts said gold futures weakened due to middle 
eastern sales of gold bullion and perceptions that more middle 
eastern selling could occur over the weekend 
this seems to be a pattern weve developed on fridays traders 
get quite nervous and sell out because of fears of weekend sales 
from the middle east said peter cardillo commodity trading 
adviser with the futures brokerage jesup josephthal amp co 
tierney said buying by swiss and us investors lifted gold off 
its lows the november gold contract traded as low as 37610 an 
ounce during the session 
petroleum futures tumbled on the new york mercantile exchange 
reflecting a lack of bullish developments in the persian gulf 
standoff 
instead of an escalation in the warlike rhetoric of recent days 
news reports from the middle east mainly highlighted the 
possibility that iraq will free more foreign hostages 
light sweet crude oil settled 55 cens to 117 lower with 
december at 34 a barrel heating oil was 226 cents to 296 cents 
lower with december at 8742 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
265 cents to 309 cents lower with december at 8921 cents a 
gallon 
pork belly futures soared their permitted daily limit of 2 cents 
a pound on the chicago mercantile exchange boosted by higher 
prices for fresh bellies analysts said belly demand by bacon 
makers remained strong 
cattle futures ended mixed in dull trading 
live cattle were 08 cent lower to 10 cent higher with december 
at 7710 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 18 cent 
lower with november at 8722 cents a pound live hogs were 18 cent 
lower to 53 cent higher with december at 5275 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with 
february at 6445 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the chicago board of 
trade soybeans sold off late in the session amid disappointment 
that president bush did not announce export credits to the soviet 
union friday as some analysts had expected 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with december 
at 265 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents higher with 
december at 230 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent higher 
with december at 121 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1

last month from septembers 57 percent but nonfarm payrolls fell

the government also reported that its chief economic forecasting 
gauge the index of leading economic indicators dropped 08 
percent in september for its second straight monthly drop 
foreign exchange markets sold the dollar down following the 
release of both reports believing the data would put more pressure 
on the fed to nudge interest rates lower as a means of stimulating 
the economy 
lower us interest rates are bad news for the dollar which 
like all currencies is supported by higher rates 
jack barbanel a market analyst with first global asset 
management inc said the dollar was further hurt by germanys 
decision thursday to raise a key interest rate the lombard rate 
the increase gave more support to the german mark

pan am corp said friday its third quarter 
losses increased by 62 percent reflecting sharply higher fuel 
costs brought on by the persian gulf crisis 
the ailing airline reported friday that it lost 291 million 
or 19 cents per share for the quarter compared with a loss a year 
earlier of 18 million or 12 cents a share 
observers were not surprised to see the loss at pan am which 
recently announced the sale of prized london routes to ual corp in 
what is viewed as a bid to raise cash to buy time through the 
sluggish winter travel season 
its not too hopeful and thats supposed to be their best 
quarter i mean thats when people travel overseas said analyst 
raymond e neidl with dillon read amp co inc 
the skyrocketing costs of jet fuel killed any chance they had 
of making any profit in the quarter neidl said 
pan ams earnings statement said jet fuel costs averaged 772 
cents a gallon in the quarter compared with 603 cents a year 
earlier iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 sent all fuel prices 
soaring and airlines complain that jet fuel rose even higher than 
other fuels 
pan am said that for the first nine months of the year it lost 
2688 million compared with a 2739 million loss for the same 
period in 1989 
the companys main subsidiary pan american world airways 
reported a loss of 292 million for the third quarter compared 
with a loss of 291 million a year earlier 
pan am said revenues increased by 131 percent to 1154 
billion from 1020 billion for the highest total in company 
history 
pan am also pointed out that its scheduled passenger traffic was 
up 67 percent its load factor was up from 717 percent to 734 
percent and revenue passenger yield rose 8 percent 
our improvement in these key areas is very encouraging and 
gives us renewed confidence that our marketing scheduling and 
service strategies are working chairman and chief executive 
thomas g plaskett said 
but the dramatically escalating price of fuel as well as 
expense increases in virtually all other areas offset the positive 
effect these improvements might have had on our financial 
performances in the quarter 
the corporations bottom line also was eroded by 405 million 
in interest costs and a 9 million loss through foreign exchange 
transactions

americas unemployment rate held at 57 
percent in october after rising for three straight months but big 
new job losses still cut across the us economy the government 
said friday 
for the third month in a row more industries lost jobs than 
gained them the labor department said in a report analysts took as 
new evidence a recession is taking hold dramatic falloffs in 
construction and manufacturing jobs pushed nonfarm payrolls down 
by 70000 the agency said 
the jobless rate held steady rather than rising again only 
because the labor force which had been growing slowly shrank by 
183000 workers in october students return to school probably 
explained much of that drop economists said 
this is strong evidence that the economy really has lost its 
footing now and slipped into recession said robert dederick 
chief economist at the northern trust co of chicago 
the numbers point to a worsening employment picture the 
employment situation continued to deteriorate in october said 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
it clearly shows a downturn i think youd have to be 
pretty starry eyed to think otherwise said peter radford of 
national westminster bancorp in new york 
in other discouraging news friday the commerce department said 
its index of leading economic indicators dropped 08 percent in 
september for its second straight decline three consecutive drops 
in that index are generally considered a sign that a recession is 
imminent 
before october the nations unemployment rate had risen three 
months in a row increasing half a percentage point from junes 52 
percent rate 
analysts have expected the nations jobs outlook to continue to 
darken partly because of the turmoil in the persian gulf the oil 
price shock and the threat of war have left american businessmen 
skittish about adding employees analysts said 
they buttoned up the overcoat put on the scarf and the 
galoshes too businessmen really are preparing for the worst 
dederick said 
in addition analysts add that the economy had shown little sign 
of life even before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
many expect the jobless rate to continue climbing in coming 
months possibly up to as much as 65 percent by next summer just 
in the past week several major corporations announced largescale 
job layoffs including general motors plan to idle 27000 workers 
the nations 70000job loss in october followed a september 
payroll decline of 52000 jobs the government said a year ago 
the economy was producing nearly 200000 new jobs a month 
construction lost 80000 jobs last month to reflect a continued 
deterioration in the housing market over the past five months 
that industry has seen jobs tumble by 185000 and its unemployment 
rate surge from 97 percent to 132 percent the government said 
in manufacturing payrolls fell by 60000 in october as that 
sector continued on an 18month downward spiral since reaching a 
post recession peak in january 1989 the manufacturing sector has 
lost 580000 jobs the government said 
in another sign of weakness the average work week for private 
businesses fell to 342 hours from 347 in september that 
halfhour drop was the largest decline since the 198182 recession 
when the work week dropped sixtenths of an hour in january 1982 
from 350 hours to 344 hours

electronic data systems on friday canceled a 
multibilliondollar deal with continental airlines for half the 
airlines reservations system 
the action is a blow to beleaguered continental which has been 
trying to raise cash the houstonbased carrier last week mulled a 
bankruptcy declaration but instead decided to try to sell some 
assets 
the reservation system called system one is one of 
continentals most prized assets and would have yielded an 
estimated 4 billion from the eds deal over 10 years 
continental spokesman art kent said the collapse of the deal 
would have no effect on the companys immediate situation money 
from the transaction was to have been placed in escrow for 
disbursement when the bankruptcy of continentals sister carrier 
eastern airlines was resolved he said 
eds and continental attributed the cancellation to the upheaval 
in the airline industry caused by higher jet fuel prices the 
increase has cut into airline profits and forced carriers to raise 
ticket prices 
its not a positive impact and was one of a number of factors 
that over time led us to believe we should not go forward with 
this transaction said roger still a spokesman for dallasbased 
eds the computer services subsidiary of general motors corp 
if youre going to enter into a fairly complicated deal 
anything that has a financial impact on one of the partners has an 
impact on the entire deal still said 
continental president hollis harris said this week that the 
company paid 70 million more in october for jet fuel than it did 
in july just before iraq invaded kuwait and triggered a sharp 
increase in oil prices the carrier uses 35 million gallons of jet 
fuel a day 
continental the most actively traded issue on the american 
stock exchange lost 50 cents on friday to close at 262 per 
share 
general motors class e stock which represents its share in eds 
slipped 12 cents to close at 3337 per share on the new york 
stock exchange 
both companies said discussions would continue on other 
marketing and management ventures involving system one 
the agreement first made in february and signed in september 
would have made eds the first nonairline company to participate in 
an airline reservations system 
the deal created two partnerships the first involved the 
reservations system itself and the second involved technological 
services system one provides to other airlines and travelrelated 
customers 
kent said fridays action was a postponement of the full 
breadth of the working relationship between the two companies 
eds has great knowledge and technology to bring to what system 
one does kent said 
neither still nor kent had specific details on how the canceled 
deal may be reformed 
airline analyst bob bernstein of the edward d jones amp co 
investment firm in st louis said the cancellation was a 
disappointment for continental 
this was a way of gathering some cash to possibly tide them 
over a weak airline traffic situation that appears to be coming 
with the higher ticket prices bernstein said 
continentals financial problems may force the company to lay 
off some workers harris said during a speech to houston leaders 
wednesday 
the carrier is already negotiating the sale of its houston 
airline food service operation chelsea catering 
it also may sell a lucrative honolulutokyo route to air 
micronesia the carrier has only had the route for six months it 
begins in houston and is the only one from texas largest city to 
japan
