prosecutors said saturday that 
opposition leader kim daejung received 10000 from a lawmaker 
accused of being a spy for communist north korea 
they made the announcement at the formal indictment of rep suh 
kyungwon 52 and his aide bang yangkyun 34 if convicted of 
spying suh and bang could be sentenced to life in prison 
the prosecution claims that suh a member of kim daejungs 
party for peace and democracy secretly visited north korea in 
august 1988 and received 50000 from communist leaders 
there was no immediate comment from kim daejung kim wonkee a 
senior member of the opposition party called the allegations 
complete fabrications 
the prosecutions claim that kim daejung received money from 
suh followed allegations linking the leader of the largest 
opposition party to the spy case kim daejung has denied the 
allegations 
an earlier prosecution statement said that suh was recruited by 
north korean agents operating in west germany in 1985 and they gave 
him 70000 over a threeyear period it said suh informed north 
korea about the political situation and dissident movements in 
south korea 
the prosecution said suh has confessed it said suh claimed kim 
daejung gave him 1000 a few days before he made the trip to 
north korea and when suh returned he gave kim daejung 10000 
prosecution officials said they would subphoena kim daejung to 
determine if he had received 10000 and knew it was from the north 
koreans 
the prosecution claims that both kim daejung and kim wonkee 
knew in april 1988 about suhs planned trip to north korea 
under south koreas security laws it is a crime not to inform 
authorities about planned contacts with north korea 
kim daejung who ran for president in 1971 and 1987 was 
questioned by government intelligence officials last week about 
possible involvement in the spy case 
after the interrogation kim daejung said he had been cleared 
of all allegations but the agency for national security planning 
nsp said the investigation would continue officials said the nsp 
was trying to determine if kim daejung had sent a message to north 
korean leaders through suh 
six people have been indicted in the spy case but they have not 
been arrested they were charged with failing to report suhs 
activities to authorities

to the area and began sharing drug needles with other users before 
becoming ill the cdc said 
nona nonb hepatitis transmitted via injections such as drug 
needles or transfusions accounts for between 20 percent and 40 
percent of the viral hepatitis in this country the cdc said

associated with drug use the atlantabased agency said

the nations of central and south america have 
made significant progress in their polioeradication efforts in 
recent years us health officials said 
in the americas a record low 335 confirmed polio cases were 
reported last year down 64 percent from 930 confirmed cases in 
1986 the us centers for disease control said thursday the 
progress follows a 1985 pan american health organization initiative 
to eradicate indigenous transmission of wild polio virus by the end 
of 1990 
with special efforts toward the remaining pockets of polio the 
1990 goal probably can be achieved the cdc said but at this 
point transmission may continue in several countries including 
brazil which reported 106 cases in 1988 and peru which reported 
58 the cdc said 
polio a paralyzing viral disease has been essentially 
eliminated in the united states although the cdc said reports of 
some cases related directly to polio vaccine are pending canada

chinas film industry which had previously 
encountered controversy in selecting its annual awardwinners did 
not name a best picture this year the official xinhua news 
agency said 
the china film association each year selects the recipients of 
the golden rooster awards but a lack of outstanding films made 
it impossible this year xinhua quoted film experts as saying 
thursday 
awarding of the golden rooster has created controversy in recent 
years as chinas film industry becomes increasingly bold and 
creative but since the military crushed the studentled 
prodemocracy movement in june the government has cracked down on 
dissent and criticized some reforms as having gone too far 
this was the first time since the award was established in 1981 
that no film was named best picture 
golden rooster awardwinners for best actor best director and 
best actress were named but the film association said there would 
be no award ceremony this year 
this years top honors for the hundred flowers awards based 
on public opinion polls went to the village of widows billed 
as chinas first sex movie and about marriage customs in a 
coastal town in fujian province chuntao about the life of a 
woman in the 1930s who lives as a garbage picker and the 
republic will never forget about the construction of a major 
steel plant 
announcement of the golden rooster awardwinners was delayed two 
years in a row because of behindthescenes wrangling 
in 1986 judges debated for months before giving the award to 
wild mountain about conflict between spouses over tradition 
and modernization 
in 1987 awarding of the golden rooster was delayed until the 
following year conservatives in the leadership apparently objected 
to the portrayal of petty powerhungry party officials in a 
small town called hibiscus about a woman branded as a capitalist 
during the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
last year the awardwinners were named on time but only after 
heated public debate about the old well and red sorghum 
both of which focused on backwardness and poverty in china

gen colin powell tapped as the next chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff is widely viewed as an adroit 
politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the us 
military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad 
powell 52 was nominated on thursday by president bush to 
become the nations top military officer 
i am ready to go to it and i look forward to the challenges 
ahead powell said 
hes expected to win easy senate confirmation and make history 
as the first black and the youngestever officer to hold the post 
powell who served as national security adviser in the final 
year of president ronald reagans administration will succeed adm 
william crowe jr who is retiring sept 30 
bush praised powell a decorated veteran of two combat tours in 
vietnam as a complete soldier as well as a distinguished 
scholar 
as we face the challenges of the 90s it is most important 
that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff be a person of 
breadth judgment experience and total integrity bush said 
colin powell has all those qualities and more 
powell fits the mold of bushs national security advisers 
likeminded pragmatists who favor consensusbuilding rather than 
confrontation 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed service 
committee called powell an excellent nominee nunn said his 
panel will hold confirmation proceedings soon after congress 
returns from recess in september 
the fourstar generals associates predicted he will work hard 
to present all sides to the commanderinchief 
he was marvelous to work with because he could deal with all 
the internal conflicts that the national security council adviser 
must resolve for the president said dan howard former nsc 
spokesman who was recently confirmed as undersecretary of the navy 
colin was an honest broker he was very fair in presenting 
others viewpoints that doesnt mean he didnt have one because 
he did he was just very fair and could present all sides without 
putting a spin on it thats a rare talent in this town howard 
said 
such abilities will be essential when powell is called upon to 
deal with the intense rivalries that can afflict the pentagon 
contests among the services are widely expected to reach new highs 
as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the soviet 
threat diminishes 
as well powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen 
the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political 
finesse with congress are as essential as toughened battlefield 
instincts 
powells nomination was met with surprise by some in the 
pentagon given that his political credentials are deemed to have 
outweighed his military experience but those who know him contend 
his mix of jobs in command roles and political trenches of 
washington will stand him in good stead 
hes been head of the nsc hes commanded troops in europe 
hes dealt with the national guard and reserve in his current 
post and hes been at the elbow of the secretary of defense hes 
had experiences few can match said robert sims a former 
pentagon spokesman who knew powell when he served as defense 
secretary caspar weinbergers military aide 
powell currently is commander of the army forces command in fort 
macpherson ga responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million 
troops on active reserve or national guard duty 
along with his predecessor as national security adviser frank 
carlucci powell was credited with helping the reagan white house 
recover from the irancontra affair he was a key figure in the 
planning of reagans national security strategy and for his summits 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
before his stint at the nsc powell commanded the army v corps 
in west germany for six months earlier he was weinbergers senior 
military assistant from 198386 
powell was born of jamaican immigrant parents in new york city 
and raised in the south bronx 
he was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a 
bachelors degree in geology at the city university of new york he 
got his first taste of the white house in 1972 during a stint as a 
white house fellow at the office of management and budget 
powell served in southeast asia as an adviser to south 
vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an 
infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and 
1969 
holder of a purple heart for being wounded in combat powell 
also won the bronze star for valor

public health officials must prepare now to 
meet an expected upswing in youth suicides in the late 1990s says 
a task force that recommends educating more people about the 
warning signs 
in a report released late thursday the task force said that 
while mental illness is often related to suicide many young people 
who take their own lives dont have a major mental illness 
an estimated onethird of all young people who commit suicide 
do not appear to fit the known picture suicides occur in loving 
and supportive families as well as in disrupted families among 
highachieving as well as lowachieving students said the report 
the task force was appointed in may 1985 by thensecretary of 
health and human services margaret heckler and held a series of 
national conferences on youth suicide 
the report said that among the 28620 americans who committed 
suicide in 1985 about 4760 were between the ages of 15 and 24 
for this age group suicide is the second leading cause of death 
after accidents 
the suicide rate among 15 to 24yearolds climbed steadily from 
1950 when the rate was 45 per 100000 to 1979 when it reached 
124 per 100000 the report said 
between 1979 and 1985 the rate declined to 12 per 100000 
people in this age group though experts believe this may be due to 
a decline in the age groups population during that period the 
report said the experts said that when the number of people within 
an age group increases such things as homicides drug use and 
suicides also rise 
with an increase in the number of adolescents projected for the 
late 1990s the task force said public health officials must 
prepare now to meet another expected upswing in suicides 
only a portion of young suicide victims had a major mental 
illness the report said however many had a history of conduct 
disorders characterized by impulsive aggressive antisocial 
behavior often complicated by substance abuse 
others were socially inhibited perfectionists or prone to 
extreme anxiety in the face of social or academic challenges the 
report said 
the report said the breakup of a relationship a recent arrest 
or rape were the most common events leading to suicide other risk 
factors included drug and alcohol abuse by the victim or a member 
of the victims family loss of a parent a history of abuse or 
neglect and homosexuality 
the task force said public health officials need to develop a 
uniform definition for suicide so it can be reported more 
consistently and completely 
the report also recommends more research to determine what 
prevention strategies work best and better education efforts to 
make the public and health service providers more aware of the 
warning signs and better prepared to provide care for those who 
need it 
the report said three times as many females ages 15 to 24 as 
males in that age group attempt suicide but five times as many 
males in that group succeed 
guns were the most frequently used method for suicide victims in 
this age group followed by hanging drug overdose and jumping from 
a high place

fans of federal alphabet soup 
heres a tongueincheek glossary of some of the phrases that 
will soon be on every bureaucrats lips as well as those that 
mercifully will fade into history 
saif a reassuring acronym pronounced safe as in your 
money is safe if its insured by saif it stands for savings 
association insurance fund an organization once called fslic 
pronounced fizzlick unfortunately fslic fizzled creating the 
crisis that led to the bailout 
ots pronounced oats is the office of thrift supervision it 
was once called fhlbb the federal home loan bank board pronounced 
flub usage fhlbb flubbed its job so it was folded into the 
treasury department and renamed ots 
under a preliminary version of the bill ots would have been 
called cosa pronounced cohsa chairman of the office of savings 
associations but that was dropped perhaps because it stirred 
unpleasant memories of allegations that fhlbb was too cozy with the 
industry it regulated 
bif pronounced like the sound created when batman or robin 
slugs a crooked thrift executive is the bank insurance fund now 
that the fdic federal deposit insurance corp has control of two 
insurance funds one for commercial banks and the other for 
thrifts it had to come up with a name for the bank fund 
firrea pronounced fihreeah it stands for financial 
institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 at a 
white house ceremony president bush said im proud to sign this 
monster 
the rtc resolution trust corp was created by firrea its

tests conducted by the pentagon on the bigeye 
chemical bomb are incomplete and major developmental questions are 
unresolved says a congressional agency 
there is no doubt in my mind that the bigeye bomb is years 
away from readiness for production said rep dante fascell the 
chairman of the house foreign affairs committee who requested the 
study from the general accounting office congress investigative 
arm 
the bigeye bomb is a binary chemical weapon the defense 
department plans to build to modernize the us arsenal in 
february 1988 president reagan certified the bomb as essential to 
national security authorizing the pentagon to spend 90 million to 
build production facilities 
however the gao said thursday that the defense department used 
one test to reach its conclusion that pressure buildup will not be 
a problem for the bigeye the gao also said the number of tests on 
flashing were insufficient 
pressure buildup could destroy or disable the weapon flashing 
is the burning or vaporization of a chemical agent 
fascells panel released an unclassified version of the report 
the classified form included comments from the defense department 
the pentagon earlier had said fullscale production of the 
weapon is not planned until 1990 
fascell said that this year congress wisely instructed the 
pentagon to keep the bigeye in testing until these problems were 
solved 
binary weapons take their name from the fact that they are 
composed of two chemicals kept separate until the bomb is dropped 
or artillery shell fired the two chemicals are harmless until 
mixed at which point they form a deadly gas

to most people former president reagan went a 
bit far a few years ago when he called the nicaraguan contras the 
moral equivalent of the founding fathers 
if the contras dont rank with the likes of thomas jefferson in 
the eyes of the majority they have been one of those causes that 
has kept conservative brows in a fevered state for years 
and when central american presidents set a dec 5 deadline 
monday for the demobilization of the contras conservative wrath 
was once again energized 
on no issue since the vietnam war have conservatives and 
liberals squared off as they have over the contras democrats saw 
reagan as contributing to massive death and destruction in a 
country that could never pose a security threat to the united 
states 
conservatives saw democratic resistance to the contras as 
guaranteeing the survival of a marxistleninist regime intent on 
spreading the gospel according to fidel castro right up to the rio 
grande 
rep henry hyde rill long a stalwart contra backer called 
the proposed dismantling of the contras a disaster he said 
that outcome might have been averted if congress had shown more 
willingness to stand by the contras rather than strip them of 
military aid as it did last year 
hyde and likeminded conservatives such as former assistant 
secretary of state elliot abrams could never understand the 
congressional hostility toward the contras 
hyde said congress has a penchant for funding rebel groups in 
such remote countries as afghanistan cambodia and angola but an 
inexplicable aversion to helping out an insurgency in nearby 
nicaragua 
if nicaragua were 12 time zones away hyde said the contras 
would be riding around in rolls royce jeeps shooting silver 
bullets and sipping coors beer between battles all compliments 
of the us congress 
abrams spent four years as the executor of reagans central 
america policy a role he carried out with a devotion that was so 
uncompromising that among democrats he was quite possibly the 
most disliked official in the administration 
now in private business abrams was in a grim mood after the 
central america summit he suggested that if the democrats work 
their will us aid will be manipulated by congress in such a way 
that the contras will face the choice of starving in honduran 
border camps or risking their lives or imprisonment by returning to 
sandinistaled nicaragua 
abrams said salvadoran president alfredo cristiani entered the 
summit hoping to win approval of a resolution putting the contras 
on an equal footing with the leftist guerrilla movement in his 
country 
but cristiani backed away and acquiesced in the consensus 
resolution to demobilize the contras but not the fmln in el 
salvador 
as abrams saw it cristiani felt that congressional democrats 
would punish him by cutting off aid to el salvador if he were 
responsible for a stalemated summit 
that in turn would leave el salvador vulnerable to a takeover 
by the leftist guerrillas a price that cristiani was unwilling to 
pay abrams said 
much of the debate in the coming months is expected to focus on 
where the contras will settle to many outsiders a process of 
national reconciliation in nicaragua is under way and the contras 
will be able to return safely to their homeland without fear of 
reprisal 
hyde disagreed and said the administration should do what it can 
to help the contras resettle in the united states initially he 
said he favored their relocation in fort worth texas home of 
former rep jim wright who fought contra funding tooth and nail as 
house speaker 
but with wrights resignation this past spring the fort worth 
option has lost its appeal hydes alternate suggestion delivered 
in jest is that connecticut home of anticontra warrior sen 
chris dodd would make a fine home for the contras as well

suspected spy felix s bloch is protected from 
being fired or losing his pension while the case against the us 
diplomat is investigated an official of the foreign service union 
says 
theres a certain amount of due process charles schmitz a 
state department diplomat and vice president of the american 
foreign service association said thursday 
he can be stripped of his pension if hes convicted of treason 
or some other high crime 
the state department put bloch a 30year foreign service 
officer on paid leave from his job june 22 soon after the state 
department announced that the fbi was investigating him for 
illegal activities involving agents of a foreign intelligence 
service 
bloch has not been charged with any crime 
the department does not bring charges unless it believes it 
has sufficient evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable 
doubt that a person is guilty of violating the law justice 
department spokesman david runkel said thursday when asked about 
possible charges against bloch 
administration sources have said there is a videotape of bloch 
passing a briefcase to a soviet agent in paris that same agent 
later was monitored giving bloch what officials believe was a 
telephone warning that he was under suspicion 
fbi agents have been interviewing people acquainted with bloch 
asking questions ranging from whether he had a foreign girlfriend 
to if he was a stamp collector bloch reportedly told the fbi the 
briefcase contained stamps 
agents and the news media have monitored blochs every move 
including walks with his pet poodle this week bloch and his 
entourage took a 22mile trek and on another day camped on a park 
bench for a few hours 
should bloch be fired schmitz said he would be entitled to an 
administrative hearing that decision could be appealed to a 
federal court in the district of columbia 
blochs pension would amount to 60 percent of his 77500 annual 
salary 
pretrial publicity has jeopardized any chance of a fair trial 
schmitz said 
if hes guilty theres a lot that muddied the case if hes 
innocent his reputation has been pilloried in public his career 
has been in effect terminated he said 
schmitz described bloch whom he said he knew only slightly as 
sturdy diligent solemn solid

improved environmental safeguards are needed 
before any oil exploration can occur in three disputed sites off 
the california and florida coasts a task force said today 
the task force charged with recommending to president bush 
whether to open the three sites for oil exploration made clear in 
a progress report that it has made no decision on whether drilling 
should be allowed 
but it said that before a decision is made additional 
restrictions are needed to reduce the environmental impact of 
such drilling it outlined a long list of options aimed at 
improving environmental safeguards but said no decision has been 
made on which ones to recommend to the president 
in february bush directed the task force to examine the 
environmental concerns surrounding the proposed oil drilling on the 
two california sites which together cover nearly 8 million acres 
off the states northern and southern coasts 
he also asked for a review of plans to sell leases for oil 
development in a third site covering 14 million acres in the gulf 
of mexico near the florida everglades 
there has been strong opposition to opening the three areas to 
the oil companies because of fear that drilling would endanger 
nearby environmentally sensitive areas the concern intensified 
after the massive oil spill from the exxon valdez tanker last march 
in alaska 
the task force headed by interior secretary manuel lujan has 
conducted nine hearings so far and a recommendation is to be made 
at the end of the year 
the report said that during the hearings most of more than 650 
witnesses and some 11000 written comments have expressed intense 
concern about the potential environmental harm that could be caused 
by oil exploration at the three sites 
many people expressed the view that while they would suffer 
the losses from any environmental effects of oil and gas 
development they stand to gain few if any of the potential 
benefits said the task force at the same time the group noted 
oil and gas industry spokesmen disputed the environmental concerns 
and suggested the risks are minimal 
the task force said various restrictions designed to reduce 
the environmental impacts of oil and gas development should be 
considered before deciding whether to allow drilling 
options cited by the task force include the widespread use of 
buffer zones between drilling sites and environmentally sensitive 
areas and an array of proposals to protect against oil spills or 
control damage if a spill should occur 
other options include requiring oil from the three areas to be 
transported to shore by pipeline and not tanker that oil companies 
hold a special bond to assure adequate compensation for spill 
damage that permanent emergency response teams be established with 
adequate equipment manpower and training and that tankers if 
allowed be limited in size and have double bottoms

their motto is be prepared but some 
boy scouts say they were not ready for what they found at a rainy 
campout in norway 
half the 19000 scouts were girls 
when we have a boy scout jamboree in the states its strictly 
boys we were taken a little off guard said charlie hart 
scoutmaster of an american troop for the children of us soldiers 
based in west germany 
eight soviet boys also were among the 2500 visitors from 26 
nations at the norwegian national jamboree 
this is first time we have had soviets at a norwegian 
jamboree and may be the first time anywhere since the soviets 
dont have scouting said camp spokesman perolav lie 
he said the boys members of the soviet communist party youth 
organization were sponsored by the lions club in moss norway 
norway formed coed scout troops in 1978 said anne marie 
kristensen a spokeswoman for the weeklong jamboree which ends 
sunday 
organizers said that no thefts vandalism or use of alcohol were 
reported so far at the biggest scouting event in the world this 
summer being held on 185 acres of fields 15 miles west of oslo 
there have been quite a few cases of puppy love but having 
boys and girls together teaches them mutual respect said gary 
andrew of us troop 204 based in west germany 
dan warren flew in from the united states as one of 30 scouts 
from troop 368 of arlington mass warren said he discussed poetry 
with norwegian girl scout kirril kaas while they shared a rain 
poncho 
steven mcclenaghen 14 of a british boys troop from inverness 
scotland said camping with girls is more like the real world 
my girls are very popular they are the only american girls 
here said carol butler a california scout leader who heads a 
us girl scout contingent of eight picked from 300 applicants 
throughout the united states 
coed camping was not the only suprise awaiting foreign scouts 
when they arrived last sunday 
when they said bring rain gear we thought they meant 
raincoats but when norwegians say rain gear they mean headtotoe 
waterproofing said one american scout slogging along a muddy 
trail 
a norwegian girl cried mud mud mud from a soggy tent 
a greek girl scout shivered in the rain 
however a troop from switzerland said the weather was no 
problem 
we got here in the middle of the night and had to set up camp 
in the pouring rain it doesnt matter we can set up these tents 
blindfolded in any weather said marcel zollinger of a coed 
troop from effretikon switzerland 
norways king olav v the norwegian royal family and domestic 
celebrities visited the jamboree 
i couldnt believe how open it was i walked right up to the 
king said scoutmaster alex hodge of troop 419 from the us air 
base at lakenheath england 
norwegians may joke about camp romance but they also engage in 
traditional scout activities such as hiking and outdoor skills 
there is also a daily camp newspaper and radio station 
today they were to try to break the world barbeque record held 
by a school in hawaii by feeding all 19000 scouts from 700 grills

on a cold day last november the wassef 
family left the snug anonymity of their middleclass detroit 
neighborhood for the halfworld of spies and intrigue so often 
associated with the middle east 
its a tale of two sons born in egypt and reared as americans 
and a personable american soldier of fortune the egyptians say is a 
cia agent 
its a story the egyptian government has made little fuss over 
one the us government has largely ignored 
to beba wassef the mother its a nightmare 
in midjuly in a 90minute trial without witnesses a security 
court convicted samy wassef 26 and his brother samir 30 of 
spying for the united states each was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison and fined 10000 egyptian pounds 3850 
the prosecutor said their crime was agreeing with a foreign 
intelligence agency to sell information from newspapers and other 
sources about moslem fundamentalism moslemchristian relations 
egypts economy and other topics 
samir a pediatrician is in the united states samy is in 
prison 
also sentenced was nicholas edward reynolds who left egypt in 
the fall of 1987 friends knew him as a maker of travel films based 
in california he was identified at the trial as the wassefs 
central intelligence agency spymaster 
security police knocked on samy wassefs door nov 14 and 
invited him to accompany them for questioning he had graduated 
from the cairo university medical school and was about to return to 
the united states 
samy was held in a prison south of cairo for eight months 
uncharged despite a confession which he said investigators 
essentially fabricated he had occasional visits from family 
consular officials and lawyers 
little has changed since the trial except that egypt considers 
him a convicted traitor 
beba wassef calls her son the forgotten american 
mrs wassef who has heart problems and high blood pressure is 
trying to change that she said she spent months quietly asking for 
help from the egyptian and us governments now she is shouting 
all these months i trusted the americans i felt secure that 
they were helping samy she said yesterday i learned the 
truth an embassy official admitted nobody has discussed samys 
case with the egyptian government all these months 
hes rotting in jail his life is ruined his career is 
ruined his health is deteriorating 
and the americans have never brought it up 
she said she was told one problem for the us government is 
that egypt considers her son egyptian not american 
that she said is rubbish 
samy entered egypt on an american passport which has been 
taken away by egypt his mother said 
he is an american he feels like an american he loves 
america he came here to study medicine but that doesnt mean he 
left his citizenship at the airport 
when mrs wassef visited the us embassy on sunday as she does 
almost daily she quoted president bushs weekend statement about 
joseph cicippio an american hostage in lebanon whose kidnappers 
suspended a death sentence against him last week 
he said that just being an american is enough for your 
president the senators everybody to care about you she said 
he mentioned a big loving family in norristown pa thats 
eating its heart out 
i can understand that because we have a big loving family in 
detroit thats doing the same but nobody cares about samy 
the embassys position has been that the wassefs receive 
normal consular services it said the embassy supports any 
action mrs wassef feels she must take to help her son 
on monday embassy spokeswoman marcelle wahba said the 
embassy will not issue statements because the matter is under 
legal consideration requests for interviews with consular 
officials were denied 
in washington rep william broomfields office said the 
michigan republican had urged the state department and egyptian 
officials to get samy wassef released spokesman bob jenkins said 
were going to do everything we can to win samis freedom and 
get him back to michigan said a spokesman bob jenkins 
he said broomfield ranking republican on the house foreign 
affairs committee had written to president hosni mubarak and abdul 
raouf el reedy egypts ambassador to the united states 
a congressional source said egypt was sensitive about the case 
and wanted it handled quietly the source said an egyptian court 
was expected to review it soon 
the wassefs say samy and samir met reynolds several years ago 
when reynolds asked them to contribute information for cairo today 
an englishlanguage magazine 
reynolds who had been educated at impressive universities in 
the united states and england kept a low profile in cairo 
he told acquaintances he made documentary films while working 
for sobek a travel and adventure company based in oakland and 
angels camp calif sobek employees told the associated press he 
had worked for the firm several years ago but that sobek had lost 
track of him 
the main evidence presented at the trial was samys 253page 
confession which included details of spy activities and training 
in a secret american spy school it was written in arabic which 
mrs wassef says her son reads poorly 
except for a couple of pages the whole thing was fantasy 
she said to understand why samy signed it is to understand his 
condition he had been locked up without legal or consular help he 
had been showed pictures of ropes torture victims things like 
that 
they told him his luggage was outside with a ticket home all 
he had to do for freedom was to sign that paper and he did 
she said the confession was signed before the first visit to her 
son dec 8 by conrad drescher the us consul general embassy 
sources say drescher now visits every two weeks 
weve spent all our money our time since november trying to 
do something mrs wassef said i had to leave our small son in 
michigan ive missed his birthday my husbands birthday our 
friends and relatives in michigan have sent letters all this 
time and the american embassy didnt do anything 
the family has averaged a telephone call to the embassy every 
other day for most of the time her son has been in jail she said 
what do they think we all were calling for just to hear their 
voices samy wassefs mother asked we were desperate for help 
and who does an american turn to for help but to his embassy

headless aliens from space invade russia 
huge hairy creature terrifies villagers in the volga valley 
possible ufo lands in moscow 
although president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms havent 
spawned usstyle supermarket tabloids let alone usstyle 
supermarkets glasnost has changed the soviet media as evidenced 
by these recent stories and a lot of people seem to love it 
the change is evident on staterun television once a showcase 
for morally uplifting and dull boylovestractor movies about 
building communism and news reports lauding factories 
overfulfilling the fiveyear plan 
now six days a week as part of the breakfast tv program 120 
minutes grayhaired mystic alan chumak waves his hands on camera 
to cure viewers from minsk to vladivostok of what ails them 
soviets with heart disease are requested to watch the 
selfdescribed journalist on tuesdays on fridays chumak will help 
viewers get rid of allergies people with stomach bugs or bone and 
muscle aches should tune in on other days 
the inability to watch the program is not a problem leave the 
set on and a jar of water juice or massage cream placed by the tv 
screen supposedly will be charged by chumaks gestures and can 
be used later for treatment 
earlier this summer after about a month on the air chumak was 
pulled off 120 minutes by broadcast executives who said they 
wanted to make sure his treatment brought positive results 
they must have been convinced the man in his mid50s was back 
on tv waving his hands within a week 
since the days of the wildeyed monk rasputin hypnotist and 
confidant at the court of the last czar russians have been 
intrigued by the occult and fantastic and stories about ufos 
vanished planets and esp have always had an eager audience 
with glasnost or greater openness such topics are getting more 
exposure than ever in the once stuffy official soviet media and 
despite the firmly materialistic and rationalist ideology of the 
ruling communist party 
in fact the unlikely organ in the forefront of the weirdness 
campaign belongs to the party itself the 1 millioncirculation 
daily newspaper socialist industry an organ of the partys central 
committee has a mandate to report on the soviet economy but often 
makes space for news items that have nothing to do with either 
socialism or industry 
on tuesday there was this intriguing account of invaders from 
space landing in central russias perm region milkmaid lyubov 
medvedev told the newspaper at about 430 in the morning i was 
going to the farm when i saw a dark figure seemingly riding a 
motorcycle but when i looked closely at the figure i noticed 
there was no motorcycle but just something resembling a man but 
taller than average with short legs 
the creature had only a small knob instead of a head ms 
medvedev said i was frightened to death then it became 
fluorescent and disappeared 
beekeeper g sharoglazov saw two eggshaped fluorescent 
objects as big as aircraft hovering at a height of 6001000 
feet others in midjuly also saw aliens with no heads the paper 
said 
it quoted v kopylov communist party boss in the chernushinsky 
region as acknowledging that something unusual is going on the 
territory of our two collective farms 
it was socialist industry as well that informed soviets on 
thursday of the huge fleetfooted hairy creature that terrified 
residents of the kirovo settlement in the volga basin 
i saw the creature pretty well said resident r saitov 
it was about 2 meters 6 feet tall its body covered with dark 
brown hair and it had shoulderlength hair being a veterinary 
surgeon i can say the creature was neither a man nor an ape 
saitov and a friend tried to approach the creature after 
spotting it on the other bank of a pond but it bounded away at 
astonishing speed when they pursued it in a car the newspaper 
noted disapprovingly that saratov university biologists werent 
taking reports of the sighting seriously or even deigning to talk 
to witnesses 
the very official soviet news agency tass later picked up the 
newspapers story for national and worldwide distribution 
headlining it huge creature sighted in volga region men give 
chase 
earlier this week however tass deflated another socialist 
industry report about a ufo landing 
last month the paper reported in great detail on a 26footwide 
patch of burned ground found near a southern moscow highway 
it quoted ufo specialist a kuzovkin as saying the grass had 
likely been blasted by powerful radiation which he called probable 
evidence of the landing of an unidentified flying object 
not so tass reported firefighters think a haystack simply 
caught fire and scorched the ground

one gram 
the gestation period for pandas lasts from 97 to 168 days 
according to zoologists 
panda fetuses often do not attach to their mothers womb 
immediately hoage said if lingling was carrying twins the other 
fetus may have attached itself much earlier and is now developig 
normally hoage said

resided at the zoo the pair have had a variety of troubles mating 
and delivering cubs 
since 1983 lingling has had four cubs the first was born

rising prices are placing new strains 
on ordinary filipinos and threaten social and political unrest as 
president corazon aquino seeks to restructure the nations economy 
according to official figures consumer prices increased last 
month by 103 percent their highest level since mrs aquino took 
power in the 1986 uprising that toppled president ferdinand marcos 
prices jumped nearly 12 percent in the central visayas islands 
and mindanao in a country where 300 a month is considered a 
middleclass salary any substantial price increase means hardship 
for the public and political risks for the government 
this will hit the citizenry like a cannonball in the eyes 
wrote mrs aquinos former spokesman teodoro benigno the 
gauntlet comes alive when the public reacts to price increases 
public school teachers and other government employees have 
already been agitating for salary increases which mrs aquino says 
the nation cannot afford 
theres no money wrote columnist conrado de quiros in the 
philippine daily globe why doesnt the government tell it to 
foreign banks why should it tell that to its teachers and 
workers 
teachers demanded a minimum monthly salary of 215 they now 
earn 95 which is below the poverty line the government has 
agreed to 148 a month for teachers 
even now there is a growing recognition in government that 
the moderately high growth rates of the last three years are 
plainly unsustainable wrote the independent daily malaya 
unless bold measures are undertaken we might as well kiss 
recovery goodbye 
many economists believe the outlook is not altogether gloomy 
the economy grew by more than 5 percent in 1988 and is expected to 
increase this year by 6 percent 
agriculture the livelihood of more than 60 percent of the 58 
million filipinos grew by more than 10 percent investment jumped 
more than 106 percent in the first four months of the year 
according to the philippine securities and exchange commission 
despite the impressive statistics the aquino administration has 
been unsuccessful in spreading the effects of growth to the 
majority of the population 
the government acknowledges that the poorest third of society 
controls only 9 percent of the national income virtually unchanged 
from the final years of the marcos administration 
in parts of manila elegant department stores rivaling those of 
new york and london stand within a few miles of wretched squatter 
camps where tens of thousands live in clapboard shanties 
industrial nations have pledged 35 billion in 1990 to help the 
philippine economy but the government acknowledges that the 
effects of the aid may not been seen by ordinary filipinos for 
years 
under a controversial policy memorandum to the international 
monetary fund the government agreed to a number of measures 
including gradually eliminating subsidies on rice energy water 
and other essentials 
that will reduce the budget deficit but is expected to increase 
consumer prices the government also is studying an increase in 
fuel prices which may be increased by the end of the year 
depending on the world petroleum market 
during a recent walkout by government workers employees of the 
central bank carried banners denouncing the imf and calling for 
reductions in service payments on the nearly 30 billion foreign 
debt domestic and foreign debt service accounts for 40 percent of 
the national budget

there appears to be no easy answer to the 
question of what is drug paraphernalia and businesses complain 
that they are losing thousands of dollars in merchandise that is 
being seized in government raids 
are all glass pipes illegal businessman richard k rowland 
asked the us international trade commission at a hearing thursday 
are all wood pipes illegal are all stone pipes illegal or is 
there one type that is legal all im saying is give me the rules 
and let me steer clear of this legal mine field called the mail 
order drug paraphernalia control act 
rowland whose contempo tobacco products warehouse in nashville 
tenn was raided in march said the tobacco industry needs some 
very specific guidelines as to what is and what is not drug 
paraphernalia and why 
john esau director of the customs services commercial fraud 
and enforcement center said about 14 million worth of items had 
been confiscated under the 1986 act but that tighter definitions 
are needed 
this particular law makes it extraordinarily difficult to 
define what is drug paraphernalia esau said we are going to 
rely on the courts to help us define it 
the commission an independent and bipartisan agency established 
by congress to investigate trade matters is reviewing the imports 
at the request of the senate finance committee 
among the factors the law says can be used to determine whether 
an item is drug paraphernalia are instructions about its use 
advertising how it is displayed for sale and the existence and 
extent of its legitimate uses 
the act calls for penalties of up to 3 years in prison and 
100000 in fines for each violation 
but rowland and other pipebusiness representatives said 
manufacturers and retailers cant read consumers minds and cant 
be held responsible for illegal use of legitimate items 
i agree its tragic theres a drug problem in this country 
but a lack of imagination is the only limit to turning anything 
into drug paraphernalia rowland said 
after rowlands warehouse was raided thencustoms commissioner 
william von raab announced that the 306000 items seized filling 
eight 48foot containers represented the largest such seizure in 
us history worth about 10 million 
but rowland said the items confiscated are similar or the same 
as items or materials that have been in the tobacco industry for 
hundreds of years 
itc chairwoman anne e brunsdale asked witnesses to suggest 
guidelines to help define drug paraphernalia such as a minimum 
size of a pipe bowl 
the only one who offered any ideas was lorraine shapiro of the 
mill in corning ny 
she suggested a minimum pipebowl diameter of threeeights of an 
inch and a minimum stem length of 2 inches her pipe company which 
uses imported woods lost about 45000 worth of inventory through 
a customsled raid in january she said 
esau also said the customs service wants to change required 
manifests to help pinpoint questionable items 
for example he said all imported plastic bags are listed as 
plastic bags and dont differentiate between garbage bags and 1 
inch square containers used by jewelers makers of precision ball 
bearings and drug dealers 
the primary exporters of the paraphernalia are pacific basin 
countries and areas of the middle east esau testified 
in an interview he said hong kong taiwan and japan were 
exporters adding that the peoples republic of china and korea may 
also export such items

corn production is showing a 49 percent 
improvement over last years droughtstunted crop with 1989 
estimates at 735 billion bushels the agriculture department says 
in 1988 the corn harvest yielded 49 billion bushels 
the estimates released thursday were based on usdas first field 
surveys of the year and reflected conditions as of aug 1 
overall the departments agricultural statistics board put 
total us crop production at 103 percent of the 1977 average a 
scale used to compare output from year to year 
while corn and soybean production were estimated at about 
average for the decade wheat production across the grain belt was 
forecast at weaker than usual levels with fields losing 
substantial moisture since early july 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown on american 
farms and used as feed is essential to meat poultry and dairy 
production 
usda economists estimated the yield per acre of corn in 1989 at 
1128 bushels per acre up 282 bushels from last year but 66 
bushels below the record high of 1194 bushels produced in 1987 
they estimated that 652 million acres would be harvested up 12 
percent from 1988 but 1 percent less than the july forecast 
soybean production was estimated by usdas agricultural 
statistics board at 191 billion bushels up 24 percent from last 
years harvest of 154 billion 
usda economists forecast the soybean yield at 323 bushels per 
acre the fourth highest of record and 24 percent above a year ago 
production of all wheat was estimated at 204 billion bushels 
up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest of 181 billion bushels that 
was 3 percent below the july estimate from usda 
winter wheat production was estimated at 147 billion bushels 
down 6 percent from last year durham wheat was indicated at 907 
million bushels up 102 percent from the 1988 harvest but down 19 
percent from the july forecast because of drought problems in the 
dakotas 
the average yield for all wheat was forecast at 326 bushels per 
acre just 15 below last years level with an estimated area for 
harvest of 627 million acres 
other spring wheat was forecast at 487 million bushels down 10 
percent from the july forecast but more than double the 1988 crop 
with the soviet grain crop forecast down and export prospects 
good stocks of wheat next june are projected at 474 million 
bushels almost 120 million below last month and 220 million below 
the start of the year 
cotton production was estimated at 118 million bales down 23 
percent from last year and 20 percent below 1987 
consumer prices for food rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in 
the first half of 1989 as cold weather hit vegetable fields in 
florida california and mexico poultry prices also rose sharply on 
increased demand 
but usda economists are expecting consumer prices to rise no 
more than 1 percent on an annual basis in the second half

the agriculture department estimates soviet 
grain production this year at 200 million metric tons 10 million 
below earlier forecasts and says it expects a rise in imports as a 
result 
the department said thursday that grain imports by the soviets 
in the year that began july 1 were at 36 million tons 3 million 
above previous estimates 
hot dry weather across many of the spring wheatgrowing regions 
of the soviet union combined with a shrinkage in the growing area 
are causing the drop according to a report from the foreign 
agriculture service 
it estimated wheat production was down 45 million tons to 87 
million and coarse grains decreased by 55 million to 100 million

the number of us farms fell 1 percent since 
1988 but average farm size grew from 453 acres to 456 acres the 
agriculture department says 
in figures released thursday the department estimated the 
number of farms at 217 million and said land devoted to 
agriculture amounts to about 991 million acres a decrease of less 
than 1 percent from 1988 when acreage fell below a billion acres 
for the first time 
last year the department said there were 219 million farms 
continuing a slide that began in 1982 when there were 24 million 
the proportion of farms with sales less than 10000 continued 
declining the steepest decrease as in 1988 was among the 
smallest farms those earning less than 2500 a year 
the size of farms decreased in most economic classes they grew 
for three classes 2500 to 4999 40000 to 99999 100000 
to 249999 
about 15 percent of the farms account for more than 50 percent 
of the total farmland and have sales of more than 100000 each

gov bill clinton has a 
suggestion for parents who are angry that their kids cant have 
beepers at school to help them protect their expensive automobiles 
drive crummy cars 
clinton said thursday his office has received several irate 
telephone calls from parents about the state law prohibiting the 
electronic beepers 
the problem the parents said was that the security systems for 
their cars were activated by the beepers and how dare me to 
interfere with that the governor told a meeting of juvenile 
judges 
the law was designed to prevent beepers from being used to set 
up drug deals in school clinton said 
i said listen i drove a car to school that i couldnt pay 
anybody to steal clinton said and this is more important 
than that and you need to get your kid a worse car

government records indicate that the 
department of housing and urban development gave special treatment 
to deals involving secretary samuel pierces former law partners 
and his onetime top aide 
the manhattan law firm of battle fowler jaffin and kheel and 
former aide lance wilson kept in touch with pierce during his 
eightyear tenure as head of hud in the reagan administration 
according to files pierce left at the agency 
there have been a number of allegations of favoritism at hud 
during pierces leadership separate investigations of agency 
programs during that period are being conducted by congress the 
justice department and hud itself 
the latest records indicate that hud waived regulations in one 
case that allowed developers represented by pierces former law 
firm to keep lucrative hud subsidies in another case paine webber 
inc where wilson worked after leaving government service won a 
contract to serve as huds financial adviser 
both deals had been opposed by hud staff members but the 
objections were overridden while the two instances werent 
related the law firm was involved in both 
wilson was first vice president at paine webber when it received 
a 13 million bond contract despite the fact that a hud panel had 
recommended another company battle fowler served as bond counsel 
to paine webber according to hud documents and officials 
paine webber told the new york times it was conducting an 
internal investigation 
its paine webbers policy to conduct our business in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations said spokeswoman 
eileen ruvane saying the company wouldnt comment until the 
internal investigation was complete 
on the basis of the knowledge to date we have no evidence of 
wrongdoing she told the newspaper to imply otherwise in our 
opinion would be inappropriate and inaccurate 
she wouldnt say when the investigation began or which employees 
were under scrutiny 
the developers who retained battle fowler owned an amherst 
ny project that won an unusual waiver from hud in 1988 allowing 
the project to keep hud subsidies 
the developers of allenhurst apartments included manhattan real 
estate executive stephen ross who last year contributed 100000 
to the gop and dennis penman chairman of the 1984 reaganbush 
campaign committee in erie county ny 
a hud inspector generals report questioned whether penman had 
access to internal hud information that allowed him to win backing 
for the project awarded nearly 27 million in subsidies over 15 
years 
the subsidies were awarded through a discretionary fund 
controlled by pierce and its availability was supposed to be 
advertised by the local housing agency but huds inspector general 
found that the agency never advertised the availability of the 
money instead awarding it directly to allenhurst 
because of that hud staffers suggested the funding be canceled 
according a hud official who spoke thursday on the condition of 
anonymity 
the official was asked about the project after the wall street 
journal reported on the allenhurst deal 
r hunter cushing a former ranking department official backed 
a retroactive waiver for the ad requirement arguing that if the 
subsidies were halted the project likely would default and hud 
might have to pay more than 8 million because it had insured the 
projects mortgage 
battle fowler according to documents obtained by the 
associated press from the files of pierce and a former aide 
deborah gore dean frequently lobbied hud on behalf of clients 
in the bond deals first reported in thursdays new york times 
battle fowler served as bond counsel to paine webber and salomon 
brothers which managed sales of some of the bonds 
pierces files contain a memo from an assistant telling him of 
the involvement of battle fowler and wilson in the bond offerings 
also wilsons name and telephone number are scribbled on a july 
1988 a memo to pierce from james schoenberger then huds general 
deputy assistant secretary for housing discussing paine webbers 
involvement in the bond sales 
hud officials said the selection of paine webber over the 
recommendation of a selection committee was made by 
thenundersecretary carl covitz covitz told the times he generally 
informed pierce of his activities but didnt recall any 
intervention by pierce on behalf of paine webber or battle fowler 
pierce kept in close touch with wilson his top aide from 
198184 and whom he once described as his right hand 
among the correspondence in the files was a letter from pierce 
to wilson thanking him for helping arrange a dinner in pierces 
honor wilson also sent his former boss books about wine and new 
york city restaurants

the government says it will pay farmers in foreign 
currency for surplus crops to reduce the countrys dependency on 
imported grain 
under the decree announced thursday the government could save 
money in the long run since foreign grain is more expensive than 
that grown domestically 
foreign money can be used to buy hardtoget imported goods 
providing incentive for farmers 
under the new policy growers on state farms can sell part of 
their highquality wheat peas lupine and oilbearing seeds to the 
soviet government for convertible currency the official news 
agency tass said the ruble is not officially convertible but 
foreign money is 
the government believes that the chance to earn convertible or 
hard currency will stimulate so much extra production that the 
state will end up paying its own farmers less than it would have 
paid for imports to make up chronic shortages tass said 
the news agency said the system will be introduced as an 
experiment with this years harvest and run through 1990 the 
government also will consider allowing individual farmers with 
private plots and those who lease their land to sell for hard 
currency as well tass said 
the news agencys report said the policy is in accordance with a 
decision of the congress of peoples deputies 
during the congress session in june radical economist nikolai 
shemelev suggested the soviet union adopt such a system 
he said the government should tell collective farm leaders that 
if they sell grain and meat to the state above a certain level 
they will be paid in hard currency with the right of spending it 
wherever they want 
he was interrupted by applause from the 2250member parliament 
and then said our people are modest im sure theres no need to 
pay them 200 a ton of grain they will be satisfied with 75 
in a deal announced in late june the us agriculture 
department said the soviets bought 400000 metric tons of wheat at 
about 140 a ton bringing the 198889 total to 42 million tons 
the department on thursday said it estimated soviet grain 
production this year at 200 million metric tons 10 million below 
earlier forecasts and said there would be a resulting rise in 
imports 
tass said the state would pay farmers 96 in hard currency per 
ton of strong and durum wheat 64 per ton of other highquality 
wheat 128 per ton of pea and lupine and 144 per ton of 
sunflower soy rape flax and mustard seed 
the farms will be free in spending the currency it said 
soviet citizens access to foreign currency is normally very 
restricted soviets going abroad are allowed to exchange only a 
small sum of rubles for hard currency and ordinary citizens who 
have not worked abroad are not allowed to hold foreign currency at 
all 
the restrictions have begun to loosen slightly however as more 
and more soviet firms are allowed access to foreign markets under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
the ability to buy foreign goods takes on added significance in 
the face of the worsening shortages of such basic soviet goods as 
soap detergent and medicine under the economic dislocation the 
reforms have brought

a divorce trial to determine the fate of 
seven frozen human embryos has ended leaving the judge to decide 
whether a man can stop his estranged wife from using them 
on one hand this case involves the ageless power of sexual 
reproduction on the other hand it involves a branch of science 
and mans ability to understand and control nature which is as new 
as todays headlines charles clifford attorney for junior lewis 
davis said in closing arguments thursday 
junior davis 30 sued mary sue davis 28 for a divorce in 
february he asked the court to prevent her from using the seven 
frozen embryos they created through an in vitro fertilization 
program last december he contends he has as much right to decide 
their fate as his wife 
davis wants the embryos stored at a knoxville hospital to 
remain frozen 
but mrs davis says she should be allowed to have the embryos 
implanted in her womb arguing they represent her best chance of 
becoming a mother she also contends davis is asking to acquire a 
right not normally given to a man the decision on whether a child 
should be born after he has fertilized the egg of his mate 
blount county circuit court judge w dale young said he will 
announce a decision within 30 days 
that the embryos are outside the womb should make no difference 
said jay christenberry mrs davis attorney the journey outside 
the womb did not mean the return journey was to be prevented he 
said 
the status of the embryos was an issue throughout the trial 
dr jerome lejeune research director at the french national 
center of scientific research testified thursday the frozen 
embryos are early human beings and have been since the moment 
of conception 
putting tiny human beings in a very cold space deprived of 
liberty deprived even of time they are suspended as it were in a 
concentration camp he said it is not as hospitable a place as 
the secret temple of a womans womb 
but clifford said i think it is very clear that legally 
under the laws of the united states of tennessee an embryo is not 
a human being it does not possess the rights that a human being 
possesses 
in closing arguments christenberry said that mrs davis has a 
fundamental right to decide to be a mother 
it seems to me a woman who now has the right to abort a fetus 
should have an even greater right to protect the unborn and bear 
her child or children he said 
clifford disagreed 
if the court allows mary sue davis to use these embryos the 
court makes junior davis a father that burden would be with him 
the rest of his life clifford said he said if young rules in 
favor of davis it would still leave mrs davis a reasonable chance 
of bearing a child without using these particular embryos 
the davises entered the in vitro program in 1985 the seven 
frozen embryos in dispute were yielded by their sixth attempt mrs 
davis had five tubal pregnancies and the couple also tried to adopt 
children 
in in vitro programs fertilization takes place outside the womb 
in a laboratory dish the fertilized eggs then can be implanted in 
a womans womb and brought to term although the success rate is 
about 18 percent

the overall rate of student loan defaults this 
year is below last years average the education department says 
the agency issued a new schoolbyschool list of student loan 
default rates thursday and said the overall rate of 17 percent was 
4 percentage points below last years average 
theres a lot of work left to be done but if the figures 
suggest a trend its clearly in the right direction education 
secretary lauro cavazos said 
the 17 percent rate is the percentage of borrowers required to 
start repaying their loans in fiscal 1987 but defaulted in 1987 or 
1988 figures released earlier this year showed a 21 percent 
default rate for those required to start repayments in 1986 
nearly 2 percent or 101 of the schools which include 
colleges universities and proprietary schools had default rates 
above 60 percent twothirds or 3570 schools had rates below 20 
percent 
defaults are expected to cost the nation 19 billion this 
fiscal year much of the problem involves proprietary or 
profitmaking trade schools 
although the default rate for such schools fell from 40 percent 
to 33 percent in the latest list the rate remains nearly twice as 
high as the national average and the rate for twoyear colleges it 
is nearly five times as high as the rate for fouryear 
institutions the department said 
the department attributed the decline in the overall default 
rate to several factors including improvements in data quality 
definition changes in calculating default rates a probable 
increase in loan payment deferments and public attention leading to 
a reduction in defaulters 
schools with default rates above 60 percent and those above 40 
percent that fail to reduce their rates by 5 points a year will be 
subject to penalties and termination starting in january 1991 
only schools with at least 30 people due to start repaying loans 
in 1987 were included on the departments list 
here is a list of the 10 schools with the highest default rates 
the figure in parentheses represents the number of students 
entering repayment status all of the schools are proprietary 
except carlinshar institute which is a twoyear private 
institution 
debbies school of beauty culture chicago 902 percent 51

taunts of goat face caused a 
10yearold boy to drop out of school in his ecuador village but 
hes returning to classes next month with a new face 
cesar guachichulca was born with the left side of his face 
deformed as a result of a rare birth defect goldenhars syndrome 
last week surgeons at cardinal cushing hospital in brockton 
corrected his deformed eye ear and jaw as well as the vshaped 
patch of hair on his forehead that inspired his classmates taunts 
we have a saying among our people hope is the only thing you 
cant lose the boys father bolivar said through an 
interpreter in cesars hospital room last week 
then he began to cry and put his face down on a table 
i believe in god and i kept hoping for a miracle happiness 
doesnt even say it this is a miracle 
cesar who his father and doctors said is normally talkative and 
articulate was subdued by the operation sitting in his room with 
bandages covering his swollen face he pointed toward his father 
and said i look like my daddy now 
the boys trip and surgery was sponsored in part by por cristo 
a brocktonbased team of medical volunteers founded 10 years ago 
who have treated hundreds of children in latin america the boston 
red sox baseball team also helped defray expenses 
before he left ecuador cesar spoke at length to reporters and 
thanked por cristo for the opportunity theyve given me to be a 
normal child 
he had been the top student at his school in the mountain 
village of san pedro de la bendita but cesar said he left 
because the other children made fun of me he will go back to 
the third grade next month 
bolivar guachichulca works seven days a week as a state public 
works employee earning 30 a month he gets up at 4 am every day 
to take a twohour bus ride to his job site he takes off one 
sunday a month to spend with his wife and five sons of whom cesar 
is the eldest 
the couple at first blamed themselves for cesars condition 
guachichulca said their other sons have no facial deformities 
the first question we had was why why did this happen to us 
my wife was in tears at his birth he said 
some of the residents in the familys remote village thought 
cesars deformities were caused by the devil 
when cesar was 2 his father brought him to doctors near their 
village 
they told me there was nothing they could do guachichulca 
said 
but he persisted for eight years to look for doctors who could 
help 
im like all parents i want the best for my child he said 
it only bothered him a little in the beginning but in the last 
two years its bothered him a lot he was ashamed of himself 
finally he heard about por cristo a womens auxiliary 
organization in ecuador helped him contact the group 
he eventually traveled to the coastal city of guayaquil to meet 
with martin dunn an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who founded por 
cristo and performed the surgery on cesar 
dr dunn was the first one to explain to us what it was and 
that it wasnt our fault said guachichulca 
cesar told reporters last month he wanted to be a priest but 
now he says he will go back to ecuador next month with new plans 
i want to be a doctor now he said i want to be able to 
help and operate on other children who have problems like i had

a new study that describes the precise shape 
of a key enzyme of the aids virus may help scientists develop drugs 
to disable the deadly virus researchers say 
stephen bh kent of the california institute of technology in 
pasadena said thursday that the discovery was the first accurate 
description of protease an enzyme essential in the reproduction 
cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes 
aids 
pharmaceutical company representatives said drugs that block the 
action of protease already are being tested but that the new study 
should contribute to a more detailed understanding of how the virus 
works 
kent said the description will enable pharmaceutical companies 
to develop compounds that will fit like a hand in a glove over 
the active sites of the enzyme and prevent it from producing 
reverse transcriptase the next step in the life cycle of the aids 
virus 
azt or zidovudine the only antiviral drug approved for 
treatment of aids works by blocking the action of reverse 
transcriptase protease kent said is farther upstream in the 
cascade of molecular events that leads to replication of the virus 
if you turn off this protease enzyme then you stop the 
production of reverse transcriptase he said adding that it 
would keep an aids virus from making copies of itself and thus 
prevent the virus from infecting other cells in the body 
that is the same as killing it he said 
mariusz jaskolski a member of the the national cancer 
institute which worked on the study said while other researchers 
have described the protease enzyme the new study accurately 
locates each atom of the complex molecule 
paul oestreicher a spokesman for hoffmannla roche a major 
pharmaceutical company said a number of drugs that inhibit 
reproduction of the aids virus are being developed most of which 
work by blocking the action of reverse transcriptase 
he said a drug that would block the action of the protease 
enzyme could provide another weapon in the war on aids 
sharon arnold of smithkline beckman co said scientists there 
already are testing known protease blocking agents and that precise 
description of the protease molecule would merely be a refinement 
of what is already known 
it would have been useful two or three years ago she said 
weve already been able to synthesize powerful protease 
inhibitors 
the protease structure study was a cooperative effort by the 
frederick md center research facility of the national cancer 
institute led by alexander wlodawer and by a california institute 
of technology team led by kent 
a report on the study is published this week in science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome disables the bodys immune 
system so it cannot resist infection the hiv virus most often is 
spread through close contact with blood blood products or semen 
from infected people 
as of june 30 aids had been diagnosed in 99936 americans of 
whom 58014 have died since june 1 1981 according to the centers 
for disease control no one is known to have recovered from aids

sen jesse helms effort to prevent federal 
funding of sexually explicit artwork is being compared to 
prohibitions against using tax dollars for racial or antisemitic 
activities 
lawyer bruce fein found himself defending helms and at odds with 
a panel of art experts thursday night at the smithsonian 
institutions hirshhorn museum when he questioned the propriety of 
using public funds for controversial art 
he asked panel members how they would feel if the national 
endowment for the arts gave 100000 to david dukes the louisiana 
lawmaker with ties to the ku klux klan and he decided to make 
nice crosses inscribed with the word nigger 
helms who was not at the forum was outraged by two nea grants 
given to controversial artists whose work involves homosexual and 
antireligous themes 
the north carolina republican is calling for a sweeping ban of 
federal funding of material that is obscene or indecent or 
denigrates debases or reviles beliefs or people on the basis 
of religion race creed sex handicap age or national origin 
yale art historian susan casteras criticized helms on thursday 
for wanting sanitized art while sweeping certain themes under 
the carpet 
fein argued that some may question the proper use of federal 
funds to a neonazi group that plans artwork splattered with 
antisemitic symbols and slogans 
the helms amendment isnt an effort to censor but to control 
the type of symbols people wish to give fein said adding that 
the government must have input about how its money is used 
the artists on the panel casteras former nea member richard 
andrews new york artist leon golub and photographer david joselet 
insisted the government has no right to decide what is erotic or 
immoral in the art world 
golub said homosexuals are american citizens and taxpayers who 
have a right to have themselves expressed through art 
the senate has approved helms amendment as part of the nea 
budget and added a fiveyear ban on two art groups that sponsored 
grants to photographers robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano 
mapplethorpes photos have many lesbian and homosexual images 
while serrano has a photograph that shows a crucifix submerged in 
urine 
the house reprimanded the nea last month by cutting from its 
proposed budget the exact amount of two grants that funded 
mapplethorpe and serrano 
a conference committee is scheduled to take up the 170 million 
nea budget the first week in september and helms already has been 
lobbying members to keep his amendment in the final legislation 
these are very complex issues were talking about the 
possibility of censorship artists rights said andrews 
moderator of the forum 
we need all of us whether politicians or individuals to 
resist oversimplication its the oversimplication that gives us 
the most trouble in the long run 
seems to me in a way good government is the ability to let 
the representives take complex issues reduce them to simple 
thought and make judicious judgment but never losing sight of the 
complexity of the overriding issues 
bad government to me is the ability to take complex issues 
turn them into simple building blocks and build a rickety 
construction from that which has no basis in actual fact

the military mission of space 
shuttle columbia soared on today under a shroud of secrecy briefly 
breached when the secretary of the air force confirmed the 
astronauts had released a satellite 
secretary donald rices disclosure cracked a tight barrier of 
concealment the pentagon had placed around the flight since 
columbia was launched tuesday from cape canaveral 
the information blackout was in force today as the five 
astronauts were believed to be monitoring research experiments and 
testing their capabilities as military observers in space 
the fiveday flight is scheduled to end sunday at edwards air 
force base in california 
whether it was inadvertent or not rice told a small group of 
reporters following a ceremony at macdill air force base in tampa 
the united states now has a satellite in orbit as the result of a 
very successful launch 
he made the statement wednesday but it was not widely reported 
until thursday 
i can say that was a very important day for the air force and 
the nations space program rice said when questioned about the 
reported deployment of the satellite about seven hours after 
liftoff tuesday we were extraordinarily pleased as were our 
colleagues in nasa that everything went so well 
but asked about the satellites purpose rice replied im not 
at liberty to say 
the payload was widely believed to be a powerful spy satellite 
designed to snap highly detailed photographs of military targets 
over a large area of the globe including most of the soviet union 
it would help the united states verify soviet compliance with arms 
agreements 
nasa plans to break the pentagonimposed silence saturday with 
an announcement of the exact landing time the agency said earlier 
it would occur between 9 am and noon edt 
otherwise nasa released only the astronauts menu air force

half of the sufferers of diabetes dont know they 
have it and the disease may contribute to as many as a 
quartermillion american deaths each year federal health officials 
say 
diabetes was the underlying reported cause in 37178 deaths in 
the united states in 1986 the latest year for which final 
statistics are available the national centers for disease control 
said thursday 
two reasons the cdc said lead researchers to believe that 
diabetes is behind many more deaths than that the disease was 
listed as a contributory cause of death on four times as many death 
certificates while half the death certificates for people with the 
noninsulindependent form of diabetes didnt mention the disease 
thus diabetes may be associated with approximately eight 
times as many deaths as indicated by the 37178 reported or 
about 297000 deaths the cdc said 
besides being potentially fatal diabetes in which the body 
cant properly handle sugars and starches also can cause kidney 
disease blindness and other serious complications 
the cdc estimates that in 1986 105 million americans had 
diabetes the atlantabased agency said nearly half 49 million 
were undiagnosed cases in people who didnt know they were 
diabetic cdc researcher dr robert hahn said undiagnosed cases are 
projected from surveys involving blood tests 
the cdc said more than one in five diabetics have at least one 
of three other conditions that can seriously affect their health 
smoking high blood pressure and overweight 
twentyseven percent of diabetics smoke 47 percent have high 
blood pressure and 22 percent are at least 30 percent overweight 
the cdc said researchers project that among diabetics 39000 
deaths each year are attributed to the additional problem of 
smoking 30000 are attributed to high blood pressure and 12000 
are attributed to obesity 
hahn said the highest additional risk for diabetics comes from 
smoking 
among diabetics who smoke the risk of dying in a given year 
is 23 times higher than for diabetics who dont smoke he said 
meanwhile hahn said death rates from diabetes have declined 
slowly during the 1980s from 159 such deaths per 100000 people 
in 1979 to 154 in 1986 
in the 37178 reported diabetes fatalities in 1986 the highest 
rate was in delaware which reported 263 such deaths for every 
100000 population the lowest was in nevada with a rate of 116 
per 100000 
but geographic region was not necessarily a clue to diabetes 
mortality rates just north of louisiana second in the nation at 
221 was arkansas 47th at 124 
the cdc also reported thursday that diabetes accounts for a 
large number of endstage kidney disease cases serious cases 
which require dialysis or transplants in order for patients to live 
of 33393 endstage kidney disease cases reported to medicare 
officials in 1987 the cdc said 28 percent were attributed to 
diabetes 
the agency noted that blacks american indians and 
mexicanamericans have diabetes endstage kidney disease rates 
between three and seven times higher than whites

infants of mothers who used cocaine early in 
pregnancy run a fivefold risk of urinary tract birth defects and 
the rate may be even higher according to a new study from federal 
health researchers 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
the risk of urinary tract defects was 48 times higher in children 
of mothers reporting early pregnancy cocaine use at any point 
from one month before pregnancy through the first trimester 
this is the lowest end of the risk estimate it might actually 
be higher than that said dr jose cordero a cdc birth defects 
specialist noting that other studies have indicated that people 
will not always admit cocaine use 
the cdc said cocaine flows easily through the placenta and into 
a fetus the cocaine causes a decrease in the amount of blood 
going to the baby and that decrease in blood flow leads to the 
abnormalities cordero said 
the cdc said the conclusion came from a survey looking at nearly 
5000 children born with birth defects in the atlanta area between 
196880 and interviews with the women involved 
women who report cocaine use early in pregnancy are at 
increased risk for bearing infants with urinary tract anomalies 
including malformed kidneys the atlantabased cdc concluded 
the atlanta study compared the women who gave birth to children 
with defects to mothers of children born without defects 
cordero said the risk of having a child with a urinary tract 
defect was approximately 15 per 1000 births the risk among women 
reporting early cocaine use he said was 48 times higher or 72 
per 1000 births 
the study also looked at cocaine use among mothers of children 
with urinary tract defects compared with cocaine use among mothers 
of other children early pregnancy cocaine use was reported by 14 
percent of the mothers of babies with urinary tract defects 
compared with 05 percent of the mothers of healthy children 
previous studies also had suggested a link between cocaine use 
during pregnancy and birth defects in the genital organs but 
cordero said the cdc study found no statistically significant 
association there 
the cdc noted that cocaine use in the united states has 
increased substantially during the past decade a 1985 report 
estimated 11 million regular users of cocaine among women of 
childbearing age

the youngest son of slain civil rights leader 
martin luther king jr has resigned as president of the center that 
carries his fathers name amid talk of a rift among the leadership 
over the centers direction 
dexter kings resignation was announced thursday by the martin 
luther king jr center for nonviolent social change but no reason 
was given 
civil rights leaders in atlanta said king stepped down because 
of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns and there were 
reports of a rift between king and his mother coretta scott king 
atlanta city councilman hosea williams said the center was 
encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement 
of the southern christian leadership conference which the elder 
king founded 
the centers purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of dr king 
but not to carry on the whole movement said williams a former 
lieutenant of the elder king when they started talking about 
leading the movement freeing black folk they started competing 
and both got hurt 
mayor andrew young who was an aide to the elder king in the 
60s was quoted by the atlanta journalconstitution as saying the 
resignation was part of a family dispute fueled by a generation gap 
a king center official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said mrs king might return to the presidency she relinquished to 
her son 
the king center is a nonprofit organization devoted to 
education about kings teachings and philosophy it also urges 
action on international racial issues especially apartheid in 
south africa and is host to the annual martin luther king jr 
birthday week celebration 
the sclc has taken an activist approach to the problems of 
poverty and racism since it was founded in 1957 by king and the 
revs joseph lowery ralph abernathy and fred shuttlesworth 
we are the activist arm of the movement lowery has said 
when you do that you step on toes and you dont become the most 
popular kid on the block 
the rev jesse jackson a follower of king in the 1960s and a 
former candidate for the democratic presidential nomination said 
in a telephone interview from chicago that the two groups are 
complementary rather than competitive 
the fact that dr king remains a frame of reference for 
justice is mainly that his work has been institutionalized 
jackson said referring to the center 
the sclcs legacy is direct action challenging the racism 
challenging antisemitism he added 
dexter king 28 was elected in january to take over from his 
mother who remained as chief executive officer he said he wanted 
to cut the centers dependency on donations and put it on a solid 
financial base so it could market and disseminate nonviolent 
teachings 
king could not be reached at the office of his business 
visionary development corp 
in a statement from the king center board chairman jesse hill 
jr did not address the reasons for kings decision 
it must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances 
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not 
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative 
love and revolutionary nonviolence hill wrote 
the king center on atlantas historic auburn avenue contains a 
museum and martin luther king jrs tomb

the nations health officials are scrambling to 
contain a 370 percent rise in the number of measles cases after 
years in which the old childhood nemesis virtually disappeared as a 
public health problem 
more than 8400 people have caught measles so far in 1989 and 
as many as 25 have died according to the national centers for 
disease control in atlanta 
its not really clear why its probably a variety of 
things said dr william atkinson of the cdc 
lack of immunizations is playing a big part especially in inner 
city hispanic and black neighborhoods where many youngsters are 
going without the measlesmumpsrubella vaccinations they should 
receive starting at 15 months of age 
we have to reach the parents and really convince them of the 
importance of having the child vaccinated atkinson said 
wednesday there are publicly funded clinics where children can 
receive vaccines for little or no cost 
even vaccinations arent sure protection however vaccinated 
high schoolers and college students started falling sick with 
measles early this year prompting the american academy of 
pediatrics to recommend in july that all americans under 32 get 
booster shots against the disease 
the vaccine also fails to produce immunity in 5 percent of those 
who receive it atkinson speculated that the unprotected population 
may have reached a critical number this year ripe for 
outbreaks 
the measles virus is so contagious if one infected person 
comes around it will seek out the 5 percent who arent immune 
he said 
chicago is now coping with the worst outbreak 816 confirmed 
cases by wednesday and four of the states six measlesrelated 
deaths said atkinson and dr richard m krieg the citys acting 
health commissioner 
this disease is unique in terms of the efficiency with which 
it is spread said krieg 
the virus which causes fever runny nose and rash is 
transmitted through the air in tiny water droplets from the lungs 
of an infected person 
it can remain viable in the air for upwards of two hours 
krieg said if someone in the room talks or coughs the virus 
seeks out all susceptible people if theyre not immune theyll 
get the measles 
illinois has had 1481 cases of measles this year including an 
outbreak at bradley university in peoria that hit 110 students 
according to ralph march immunization section chief of the 
illinois department of public health 
but that is still far less than the total of 3000 cases and 
nine deaths in texas since last thanksgiving officials there said 
prior to the outbreak we were having a nice slow year and 
then it just hit the fan said wes hodgson of the texas 
department of health in austin 
outbreaks occurred at places like texas tech university in 
lubbock where 300 students got sick and high schoolers have 
accounted for 24 percent of the cases he said still 37 percent 
of those afflicted have been 4 years old or less many in houston 
he said 
california also has been hardhit with about 900 cases in los 
angeles atkinson said 
krieg said publichealth officials in chicago are using 
unprecedented strategies to try to reach the most affected 
neighborhoods they include sending immunization teams around to 
public housing projects giving 500000 doses of vaccine to private 
facilities to administer free sending sound trucks out into the 
neighborhoods putting publicservice announcements on minority 
radio stations vaccinating children at street festivals and 
giving flyers to grocery shoppers at 16 stores of one major chain 
i know it will be another few weeks before we see the result 
of our efforts krieg said 
the nations 8479 cases as of aug 7 may be a drop in the 
bucket compared to the 400000 to 600000 cases reported annually 
before vaccine became available in 1963 atkinson said but this 
years number is 370 percent higher than a year ago and far above 
the lows of 1714 and 1497 in 1982 and 1983 respectively he said 
were trying to get it down and beat it but it doesnt go 
away easily he said

master takeover engineer sir james goldsmith 
has charged that congressional concern over his hostile bid for bat 
industries plc has been whipped up by a powerful multinational 
tobacco conglomerate 
on thursday it was disclosed that 209 members of the house and 
senate had written secretary of state james a baker iii asking him 
to express their concern to the british government about the 
multinational leveraged buyout 
had any of them checked they would have easily ascertained 
that the socalled facts alluded to in the letter are inaccurate 
and misleading said goldsmith 
last month the anglofrench financier combined with british 
merchant banker jacob rothschild and australian investor kerry 
packer to make an offer for bat valued at some 216 billion 
the cashless offer by hoylake investments ltd would be financed 
mostly with borrowed money 
bat the worlds largest tobacco company also has significant 
interests in financial services paper and retailing including 
such us holdings as the saks fifth avenue and marshall field 
department stores and farmers insurance group 
i am shocked that 200 people would sign a letter attacking us 
without a single one of those people checking with us as to its 
accuracy or validity said goldsmith in a statement issued in new 
york 
i can only conclude that this is the result of an intensive 
lobbying campaign by a powerful multinational tobacco 
conglomerate he added without elaboration

a week of the heaviest rains in 50 years had flooded large areas 
of southern sinloa state on the pacific coast and a few hours 
before the train passed a small dam three miles upstream broke 
federal highways police said in a preliminary report the rain 
had weakened the railbeds causing the train to sway sharply the 
floodbattered narrow bridge about 30 yards long couldnt stand 
the stress and caved in 
carlos orozco sosa director of mexican national railways told 
reporters the bridge made of steel and wood over concrete pylons 
had been inspected a month before and was found safe 
he said 600 to 700 passengers were riding the 11car pacific 
railways train on its regular 700mile run from mazatlan to 
mexicali across the border from calexico calif the line is part

a group of roman catholic bishops said the 
antiabortion movement should seize the opportunity offered by a 
recent us supreme court decision to lobby state legislatures for 
new limits on abortion 
while charging that abortion rights advocates are apparently 
trying to revive anticatholic sentiments the committee on 
prolife activities of the national conference of catholic bishops 
said thursday the court ruling marks the beginning of a new 
debate in which many voices must be raised in defense of life 
the 1500word statement called an opportunity to defend 
life suggests opponents of legalized abortion concentrate on 
such shortterm goals at the state level as limiting government 
funding of abortion requiring parental notification and consent on 
abortion for minors restricting lateterm abortions and 
installing other safeguards to prevent hasty or uninformed 
consent to abortions 
the statement by the bishops committee headed by cardinal 
joseph bernardin of chicago was a planning analysis following the 
high courts july 3 ruling upholding a missouri law that banned 
abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees from 
counseling women about abortions the decision stopped short of 
overturning the 1973 roe vs wade decision under which women have 
the right to seek abortions but allowed states to impose new 
restrictions 
in their statement the bishops made a special appeal for groups 
opposing abortion to work together the groups have been battling 
over tactics such as whether to picket abortion clinics or to seek 
a total or partial ban on abortion 
the movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its 
agenda prolife americans must not give their adversaries an easy 
victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of 
political strategy the bishops said 
the committee said the new legislative situation also raises a 
special problem involving hints of anticatholicism 
some accuse us of seeking indiscriminately to impose our moral 
ideals on other americans the bishops said that attitude 
would exclude us at the outset from this debate on the alleged 
grounds that our opposition to abortion is motivated solely by 
religious convictions 
anticatholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from 
the proabortion campaign but abortionrights advocates apparently 
seek to revivify it now that the efforts of catholics and other 
prolife citizens have begun to bear fruit the committee said 
nevertheless the bishops said we do not intend to be ruled 
out of this or any social debate by spurious interpretations of the 
first amendment we must continue to speak for those who cannot 
speak for themselves our unborn sisters and brothers 
abortion rights mobilization a coalition of groups favoring the 
legal right to abortions has sued the federal government to revoke 
the churchs tax exemption status because of its lobbying against 
abortion

but the article in the shukan post magazine recounted the 
allegation in detail and the issue was advertised in major 
newspapers 
neither the nagoya times nor the shukan post identified the 
woman who purportedly had a child by kaifu who is married with two 
grown children the shukan post said it had found the woman and her 
husband in hokkaido japans northernmost main island and that 
they had refuted the rumor 
a nagoya times editorial staff member hideo nagasaka told the 
associated press by phone that kaifus secretary had called this 
morning to protest the story and ask for a retraction 
but the newspaper was still looking into the allegation and 
would not immediately comply with kaifus demand for a retraction 
nagasaka said 
the papers story quoted unidentified political adversaries of 
kaifu as saying a woman in hokkaido had a daughter by kaifu about 
20 years ago 
as happened when allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced 
against uno the story began to get wider attention in japan after 
some foreign media reported that kaifus morals were under attack 
in the japanese media 
in unos case the weekly sunday mainichi published a detailed 
interview with an unidentified former geisha who said uno had paid 
her to be his mistress then mistreated her the allegation was not 
reported in the major national newspapers or on television until it 
had been published abroad several days later 
an opposition lawmaker embarrassed uno by asking him in 
parliament if he was suitable to represent japan abroad when his 
morality was under fire 
the identity of the former geisha later was revealed when she 
was interviewed on television and repeated her criticism of unos 
character the scandal contributed to his shortlived tenure as 
prime minister 
kaifu has promised to carry out political reforms to help his 
liberal democratic party overcome the legacy of an influencebuying 
scandal that forced unos predecessor noboru takeshita to leave 
office june 2 
uno then took over as prime minister but announced he would 
resign the day after the liberal democratics took a beating in the 
july 23 election in the upper house of parliament 
that set off a search for a replacement and kaifu was chosen to 
try to restore the liberal democrats popularity

a panamanian bank agreed to plead guilty to 
laundering drug money and pay a 5 million penalty in the largest 
moneylaundering conviction ever obtained by the federal government 
against a bank an official said 
us attorney robert l barr said thursday the panamanian 
subsidiary of banco de occidente has agreed to enter the guilty 
plea during a hearing in federal court in atlanta monday 
he said the bank will pay the first 2 million of the 5 million 
fine during the hearing 
according to our information the net worth of the bank is 
67 million so this is a very substantial penalty in terms of net 
worth barr said 
the plea comes after federal authorities announced the 
completion of operation polar cap in march which attorney 
general dick thornburgh called the largest moneylaundering 
crackdown ever carried out by the federal government 
undercover agents broke up a los angelesbased operation known 
as la mina which agents said had laundered 12 billion in drug 
proceeds in several us cities in the past two years 
thornburgh said the operation was linked to colombias medellin 
drug cartel which purportedly accounts for 80 percent of the 
cocaine entering the united states 
the government seized half a ton of cocaine and 45 million in 
cash jewels and real estate in the investigation 
it also filed civil actions in an effort to seize 412 million 
more in us assets of two banks banco de occidente of panama and 
banco de occidente of colombia that allegedly agreed to receive 
wire transfers of the laundered money 
barr said in a telephone interview late thursday that the 
investigation and subsequent guilty plea marked the first time we 
were able to identify accounts and the socalled money pipeline for 
the medellin cartel 
barr said banco de occidente was indicted in atlanta agents 
discovered the network while operating a moneylaundering 
storefront scheme in atlanta 
drug enforcement agency administrator john lawn said after the 
operation that when la mina was forced out of business agents 
operating the storefront scheme in atlanta laundered 4 million in 
three days illustrating the size of the los angeles operation 
barr said officials had to pursue a plea agreement with banco de 
occidente before mondays hearing to release some of the banks 
frozen assets so the bank could pay the initial 2 million of its 
penalty 
the case is significant barr said because federal officials 
are pursuing the defendants under the substitute asset provisions 
act 
that statute allows us to seek forfeiture of funds even though 
each and every dollar is not directly traceable to a drug 
transaction and substitute assets can be seized barr said

officials in eight northeastern states said 
president bushs proposed revisions to the federal clean air act 
would not do enough to cut auto emissions prompting them to agree 
on their own standards 
the agreement thursday by the six new england states new york 
and new jersey means that more than a third of the nations cars 
may be covered by tougher emission standards 
massachusetts environmental secretary john devillars said that 
the price of the auto emissions equipment would be 100 to 150 per 
car 
the price of not cleaning up our air is far far higher he 
said 
the eight states followed californias lead by agreeing to 
require improved air pollution control equipment and new emission 
monitoring devices on cars beginning with the 1993 model year 
the group of states calling itself the northeast states for 
coordinated air use management or nescaum represents about 
onefourth of the national automobile market combined with 
california 38 percent of the nations cars would be covered by 
tougher emission standards 
before the new regulations take effect state legislatures in 
new york maine and new hampshire must approve the changes nescaum 
officials said 
ford motor co emissions expert kelly brown said the industry 
was cooperating with nescaum 
many new cars on the road today already meet the tougher 
standards for emissions of hydrocarbons nitrogen oxide and carbon 
monoxide according to bruce maillet director of the massachusetts 
division of air quality control 
but the california regulations and those proposed for the 
northeast would require that cars meet the new standards for the 
first 100000 miles they are on the road instead of 50000 miles 
as proposed by bush 
all cars made in 1993 and thereafter would have to undergo 
emissions inspections on the assembly line instead of merely a 
sampling of cars and each car would carry an emission monitoring 
device that would alert the driver via a dashboard light when 
emission control equipment was malfunctioning 
by the year 2010 virtually all cars on the roads in the 
northeast would carry the equipment under the agreement 
the hydrocarbons from motor vehicle exhaust and oxides of 
nitrogen undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of sunlight to 
form ozone smog which can irritate the eyes and lungs pregnant 
women children the elderly and asthma sufferers are particularly 
vulnerable

workers at about 24 estonian factories and firms 
defied a government decree today and stayed off the job to protest 
a law they say discriminates against russians and other migrants 
local journalists said 
sulev hailik a journalist with staterun estonian radio said 
enterprises in the small soviet republic on the baltic sea were hit 
by walkouts for a third day but that employees at some other 
factories including the volta machinebuilding plant had returned 
to work 
a representative for the strikers claimed the walkout had spread 
to 42 enterprises and that the government measures taken to halt 
the walkout had only strengthened workers resolve 
the estonian supreme soviet presidium the governments top 
executive body issued a decree thursday night ordering an 
immediate end to the walkout and instructing the council of 
ministers or local government cabinet to ensure the uninterrupted 
functioning of the economy 
that decree did not specify how workers who continued to strike 
would be punished mentioning only vague administrative and 
criminal measures and the drafting of a tougher law on strikes 
they want to threaten us but it wont work a member of the 
strike committee said in a telephone interview from estonias 
capital tallinn this morning the strike will be continued 
the organizer who refused to give his name said strikers were 
refusing to talk to estonian officials and would deal only with 
moscow the committee on wednesday sent four representatives to the 
soviet capital to seek a meeting with vice president anatoly i 
lukyanov 
the protest by nonestonians was sparked by a new law passed by 
the estonian parliament tuesday that tightens residency 
requirements for voting and holding elected office 
nonestonian residents of the republic including leaders of the 
russiandominated intermovement group complained the law is aimed 
at them because many are new arrivals and launched a protest strike 
the day following its passage 
on thursday the walkout spread and included as many as 20000 
workers said maarika saarna an editor at estonian radio 
hailik said it was not immediately known how many workers were 
off the job today and the strike committee representative said he 
had no idea we do not know how many people work at various 
enterprises he said 
on thursday strike committee member artur kopykin claimed 37 
enterprises were affected on wednesday the strikes first day 22 
enterprises were reported on strike including shipyards and a 
motor works 
under the new election law residents of estonia must live in 
the same district for at least two years or have lived anywhere in 
the republic for a total of five years to be able to vote 
candidates for elective office must live in the same place for 
five years or in estonia for 10 years 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population and pushed for the law to protect themselves from an 
influx of russians and members of other soviet ethnic groups

after a trump shuttle jet made an emergency 
landing without its front gear owner donald trump flew to boston 
to thank the pilot and try to turn a neardisaster into a public 
relations triumph 
i think the whole crew is made up of heroes the new york 
real estate baron said singling out capt robert smith as a 
great talent 
there were no injuries among the 47 passengers and seven crew 
members on the boeing 727 which came screeching into logan 
international airport on its belly thursday morning and stopped in 
a shower of sparks 
smith 47 a former navy pilot with 19 years of flying 
experience realized the planes nose gear failed to extend as he 
approached logan from new york city at about 930 am 
he tried to free the landing gear by diving and pulling up 
suddenly and then by making a rough touchandgo landing 
slamming the main landing gear on the runway and then taking off 
when both attempts failed the jet circled for nearly an hour 
and dumped fuel over the ocean before finally making a gentle but 
ungainly landing with its nose scraping the pavement 
smith played down his efforts this was all in a days work as 
far as im concerned he said 
the emergency landing was the first major problem for trump 
since he bought the shuttle from striketorn eastern airlines on 
june 8 he quickly tried to turn any safety fears to his advantage 
i think the public confidence might be greater right now 
because of the talent of our crews trump said 
the landing resembled an aug 2 incident in which a piedmont 
airlines 737 scraped its wing and engine in an emergency landing at 
greensboro nc after its left main gear jammed no one was 
injured 
bruce nobles president of trump shuttle said the jet had been 
in service since january 1970 and was scheduled for a major 
overhaul next month 
age has nothing to do with it nobles said 
the national transportation safety board was investigating the 
incident

president corazon aquino will visit 
the united states in november for talks that are expected to 
include debt relief and the future of american military bases here 
it was announced today 
a statement from the presidential press office said mrs aquino 
will arrive in the united states nov 9 but gave no length for the 
visit presidential spokeswoman deedee sytangco said mrs aquino 
would visit canada before traveling to the united states but that 
the schedule had not been completed 
president corazon aquino has accepted the invitation of 
president bush to make a state visit the statement said 
mrs aquino last visited the united states in september 1986 
seven months after she took power in the popular uprising that 
toppled president ferdinand marcos 
the november visit was announced following a meeting between 
mrs aquino and a threemember delegation from the us house of 
representatives 
we discussed her coming to the united states said the 
delegations leader rep patricia schroeder dcolo were very 
excited that shes coming and we want to make her visit very 
successful shes very nice to us 
major issues facing the two countries include the philippines 
nearly 30 billion foreign debt and the future of the six us 
military bases whose lease expires in 1991 
us officials have said the philippines probably would become 
the second country after mexico to benefit from american strategy 
for reducing the debt burden of developing nations 
but some filipino officials believe the country should forego 
debt reduction in favor of increased borrowing because of the 
countrys economic growth potential 
the united states and the philippines are expected to begin 
talks later this year on whether to extend us military base 
operations beyond 1991 any agreement would require twothirds 
approval of the 23member philippine senate where antibase 
sentiment is strong 
mrs aquino has refused to say whether she supports keeping the 
bases she said this week that she may wait until september of next 
year before informing washington of her decision

in a sort of ussoviet peace corps 
exchange soviet carpenters are helping americans build four new 
homes and a day care center to benefit lowincome farmworkers 
its the soviets way of thanking us construction crews who 
helped rebuild soviet armenia after a devastating earthquake 
farmworkers martin and esperanza chavarin and their seven 
children will get a new house so will ramon and esther jiron and 
their four children 
the southeast yakima community center will get a new day care to 
house 50 children nearly all from poor families 
ten soviets and 10 americans working as the ussoviet 
partners project plan to spend the next month building the 
structures 
the project began this week in the yakima valley a farming 
region of central washington where migrant farmers arrive each 
summer to pick cherries apples and other fruit 
nothing like this was possible three years ago said farit 
mukhametshin 42 of moscow an official of the soviet peace fund 
and student at the ussr ministry of foreign affairs 
my hope is if the operation is continued the social life of 
both countries is improved and there can be feedback he said 
i never thought i would see soviet citizens building a day 
care center in southeast yakima said john everhart interim 
director of the center 
while project leaders like to discuss their work as raising 
walls to bring down barriers between the two peoples some involved 
have more basic goals 
i love to help poor people everywhere said margarita 
gopshtein 45 head of foreign languages at the pedagogical 
institute in tashkent 
i didnt want to come here just as a tourist i wanted to do 
something said ms gopshtein as she helped haul boards on a 
90degree day this week 
ms gopshtein who began learning english at age 17 also is 
serving as interpreter for the group most do not speak english 
everhart said the day care center would have cost 50000 with 
labor costs but will cost only 14000 because the center only has 
to buy materials 
the soviets whose expenses are paid by the moscowbased soviet 
peace fund are also learning about the united states 
my major goal is to study american culture said dimitry 
kiselyov 24 of leningrad a business student eager to meet with 
us bankers i want to visit wall street in new york the stock 
exchange and a lecture in a university

barbecued hamburgers stirfried chicken pancakes and mexican 
food said barbara gilbert director at the campbell farm 
later they will try traditional yakima indian fare she said

felix bloch the us diplomat suspected of 
spying for the soviet union admits being in paris the day he 
reportedly met a soviet agent in a restaurant and left a briefcase 
for him under the table 
in an oncamera interview with the washington correspondent of 
austrian television bloch declined to say whether he dined in 
paris with the suspected soviet agent or whether he left a 
briefcase for him according to the journalist who conducted the 
interview 
the interview which was videotaped thursday for broadcast today 
in vienna was the first time bloch has answered questions on the 
allegations against him but he maintained the pattern of his 
contacts with reporters over the past two weeks offering 
tantalizing glimpses but failing to shed much light on the 
muchpublicized case 
the austrianborn bloch 54 was suspended from his state 
department job june 22 but no charges have been brought against 
him he has been under close fbi surveillance as the investigation 
against him continues and in recent days has been leading a convoy 
of reporters and photographers on jaunts through washington and its 
suburbs 
bloch first accepted an invitation to visit the offices of 
staterun austrian tv 10 days ago but at the time he only chatted 
with the correspondent but refused to be interviewed 
on thursday he agreed to visit again and sat for a 15minute 
interview said correspondent robert wiesner 
we started off talking about vienna the cemeteries there and 
tombstones said wiesner describing bloch as relaxed 
bloch was posted at the us embassy in vienna from 1980 to 
1987 and for four of those years served as the deputy chief of 
mission 
then wiesner said he asked bloch whether he had been in paris 
on may 14 bloch thought for a long time then said yes 
wiesner said translating the interview which was conducted in 
german 
sources here have said suspicions about the us diplomat arose 
when the united states intercepted a telephone call on may 14 to 
bloch in washington from a man under surveillance in paris who 
called himself pierre the two men set up a meeting in paris and 
the united states asked french intelligence to monitor it the 
sources said 
but abc news reported last week that may 14 was the day bloch 
arrived in paris from new york and met his contact for dinner 
leaving his briefcase under the table to be picked up by the 
suspected soviet agent 
austrian police authorities said they were told by the united 
states that the suspected soviet contact posed as a finnish 
computer salesman abc said he traveled with a finnish passport in 
the name of reino gikman 
according to us sources bloch has said he only knew the man 
as a stamp collector 
did you meet a gentleman by the name of reino gikman 
wiesner said he asked bloch 
i cant answer that question bloch responded 
did you go to a restaurant and meet a gentleman and leave a 
briefcase wiesner asked 
i was in a restaurant and i enjoyed the food very much and 
there were a lot of people there bloch reportedly responded 
abc identified the restaurant as being in the plush meurice 
hotel 
are you missing a briefcase wiesner said he asked he said 
bloch paused for a long time and then answered no 
asked whether the allegations that he spied for the soviets were 
true bloch declined to comment wiesner said

authorities invoked emergency regulations to 
continue holding a blind moslem fundamentalist cleric and his 
followers on charges of antigovernment activity a government 
source said today 
a judge had ordered the release of sheik omar abdelrahman and 
the 23 other defendants behind bars but the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said interior minister zaki badr cited a 
1981 emergency law to keep them locked up 
abdelrahman a former religion professor twice was acquitted 
of charges linked to the assassination by moslem extremists of 
president anwar sadat on oct 6 1981 
that event that led to the emergency law which gives police 
broad powers of search and arrest without charge and bans 
unauthorized demonstrations and strikes 
in its fight against violenceprone extremists seeking immediate 
implementation of islamic law the government previously has used 
the emergency law to justify continued detention of fundamentalists 
freed by courts during trial 
mohammed kamal samaha president of the threemember security 
court that opened the current trial sunday ordered abdelrahman 
and the others freed on thursday and adjourned hearings until 
october he set no bail and gave no reasons for the release order 
as he read it shouts of long live justice rose from the 
defendants cage and spectators section in the courtroom a 
converted former exhibition hall in a state fairground 
but the leading governmentowned cairo newspaper alahram 
reported that interior minister badr immediately issued new arrest 
orders because the defendants are dangerous to public order 
the current trial involves 54 defendants but only 25 were in 
custody 
charges in the case stem from an april 7 demonstration by 
fundamentalists led by abdelrahman in the southern city of fayoum 
his hometown 
the cleric and the others face charges of illegal possession of 
weapons attempting to kill a police officer and assault on people 
and public property conviction can be punishable by death 
police rounded up about 1500 fundamentalists in a nationwide 
crackdown after the fayoum demonstration 
abdelrahman former professor of theology at assiut university 
was tried and acquitted on charges he inspired sadats 
assassination in a subsequent trial he was acquitted of charges 
he instigated a coup attempt after sadats slaying 
in both cases the prosecution said abdelrahman was the 
spiritual leader of an underground antigovernment group called 
jihad or holy war that was dedicated to the overthrow of the 
government

worsened a lifelong violent tendency 
he told the court he had been having more and more bad dreams

death of flower shop clerk gwen miller and the wounding of two 
other women in ardmore okla on july 21

combination store and gas station where mrs valdez worked in 
springer 100 miles northeast of santa fe 
larry warehime a firearms examiner for the state department of 
public safety said tests showed the bullets taken from mrs 
valdezs body and other casings found in the store were fired from

used in the texas and kansas shootings 
authorities in kansas have charged braun with the separate 
murders of two garden city convenience store clerks barbara 
kochendorfer and mary rains on july 19 prosecutors in texas this 
week charged braun with the murder of photo shop owner edley perry

the federal government should take emergency 
measures to help bigcity public hospitals that are losing money 
treating aids patients researchers said 
scientists from the national public health and hospital 
institute in washington dc surveyed 623 hospitals in 1987 and 
found that aids patients are concentrated in major city hospitals 
causing serious financial loss according to a study published in 
todays edition of the journal of the american medical association 
the study said the average cost for inpatient care of an aids 
victim was 681 a day while the average revenue the hospital 
received for such care was 545 a day 
these hospitals are losing large amounts of money its eating 
into their bottom line virginia weslowski one of the 
researchers said in a telephone interview thursday 
the federal government could give the financially troubled 
hospitals emergency grants and put more money into medicaid for 
aids patients said dennis andrulis principal researcher of the 
study 
ms weslowski said the government could ease the burden on the 
hospitals by allowing more patients to qualify for medicaid 
the researchers found that the burden of caring for aids 
patients falls on only a few public hospitals in cities like new 
york san francisco chicago dallas and miami 
less than 5 percent of us hospitals treat more than 50 percent 
of all aids cases the study found 
for every dollar public hospitals spend on aids outpatients the 
hospitals get back only 14 cents andrulis said 
if an aids patient is not covered by medicaid or health 
insurance public hospitals must swallow the costs themselves he

this will overwhelm the hospitals and hurt the quality of care 
for the other patients ms weslowski said 
she added that public hospitals are especially hard hit by the 
deadly disease because they attract heavy concentrations of poor 
victims many of them innercity drug abusers 
on the average public hospitals treated more than twice as many 
aids patients as private hospitals researchers found they also 
treated the largest proportions of lowincome aids patients across 
all regions 
even middle or uppermiddleclass aids patients can end up in 
public hospitals when they are unable to work deplete or lose 
insurance benefits and and have used up their financial resources 
trying to cover medical costs ms weslowski said 
anne scitovsky chief of the economics division of the palo alto 
medical foundation in california blamed the problem on the 
nations inadequate health insurance system 
an estimated 37 million americans have no health insurance she 
said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal incurable 
disease that cripples the bodys defenses leaving a person prey to 
lifethreatening infections and certain cancers the syndrome is 
spread by a virus that is spread mainly through sexual intercourse 
shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their 
infants before or during birth

dazed civilians stumbled out of basements 
and bomb shelters today to inspect damage from an overnight duel 
between syrian and christian gunners that police said killed 27 
people and wounded 152 
police said the 15hour battle involved howitzers and 
multibarrelled rocket launchers in beirut the surrounding 
mountains and the eastern bekaa valley 
the casualties raised the toll from the fivemonth confrontation 
between gen michel aouns predominantly christian troops and 
syrian forces to 576 killed and 1474 wounded 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with police 
rules said about a dozen shells crashed into baabda and the nearby 
suburbs of hazmiyeh and hadath today but that no casualties from 
that fighting were immediately reported 
on thursday the shelling escalated sharply after syrian gunners 
started pounding the presidential palace with salvos from 240mm 
mortars 
aoun moved into a bunker beneath the palace when the latest 
round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war began march 8 
in the overnight barrage rockets gouged gaping holes in 
residential apartments shattering walls and windows and triggering 
fires that blazed out of control and lighted up the night sky 
thank god were alive said mrs khadija alaya as she came 
out of a shelter with her daughter each carrying a mattress and a 
pillow to find smoke billowing from their sixthfloor apartment 
other residents of the moslem tarik jedideh district still in 
pajamas and nightgowns made their way through debris and glass 
shards carpeting the street to inspect their homes for damage 
the artillery battles have damaged thousands of buildings in 
beirut and sent all but 200000 of the citys 15 million residents 
fleeing to safer areas in southern lebanon the bekaa valley and 
northeastern mountains 
my sister fled a month ago to the bekaa she rented a house 
there i wonder whether shes still alive after last nights 
shelling said hoda qannine a housewife in tarik jedideh a 
lowincome district that took the brunt of the shelling along with 
the citys southern slums 
the police spokesman said more than 10000 shells and rockets 
rained on beirut the southeastern mountains and the eastern bekaa 
valley in a barrage that peaked at 60 shells a minute 
he said the battlefield was expanded as aouns gunners opened up 
on syrian army positions in the ancient town of baalbek and other 
areas of the valley 40 miles northeast of beirut 
reliable sources in the bekaa speaking on condition of 
anonymity said aouns gunners scored direct hits on at least six 
syrian army outposts and artillery emplacements a baalbek resident 
who drove to beirut early in the day said a dozen shells crashed 
into the city and the surrounding villages overnight 
she said syrian army ambulances brought casualties all night 
from different parts of the bekaa to a hospital in baalbek run by 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
the syrian command in lebanon refuses comment on its losses 
the current fighting began after aoun blockaded ports run by 
syrias militia allies south of beirut with the aim of salvaging 
about 100 million annually in lost customs dues 
the syrians and allied militias retaliated by besieging and 
shelling the christian enclave northeast of the capital 
aoun 54 a maronite catholic escalated the confrontation by 
declaring a war of liberation against the 40000 syrian troops 
in lebanon he said they betrayed their 1976 peacekeeping mandate 
from the arab league by taking the moslem side against the 
christians in the civil war

earth will be treated to one of the the biggest 
cosmic shows of the year tonight when the perseids meteor shower 
arrives and latenight watchers should be able to spot about one 
shooting star a minute 
the perseids meteor shower traditionally is the biggest of the 
year jack horkheimer head of miamis space transit planetarium 
and also known as public televisions star hustler said 
thursday 
but he warned stargazers not to expect a fourth of july 
fireworks display 
even at their best theyre meteor sprinkles he said try 
to spot one extremely bright meteor during the night then call it 
quits 
the perseids shower named because they appear to radiate from 
the constellation perseus are most visible after midnight each 
aug 12 the shower is made up of the remnants of a trail of dust 
left by the swifttuttle comet last sighted in 1862 
each year the earth runs through the comets old trail 
horkheimer said 
meteors are comet litter he said its like driving 
behind a garbage truck on a bumpy road the debris slams into your 
windshield 
the leftover dust hits the earths atmosphere at an altitude of 
about 70 miles and the heat ignites gases as the particles 
disintegrate in the air creating the characteristic meteor trail 
astronomers dont know whether swifttuttle will some day 
return if it doesnt the show which gradually grows dimmer each 
year could eventually disappear horkheimer said 
the perseids shower is not the only astronomical event upcoming 
on wednesday the united states especially the east coast will 
have a good view of the regions first lunar eclipse in seven years

israels foreign ministry today expressed hope 
that a roman catholic convent will be removed from the grounds of 
the auschwitz concentration camp in poland despite opposition by 
polish church leaders 
cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow poland said thursday 
conditions did not exist for carrying out a 1987 agreement between 
the church and jewish organizations to relocate the carmelite 
convent away from the camp 
macharski blamed the delay on protests by jewish groups which 
intensified this year after the february deadline for moving the 
convent passed he accused the jewish groups of creating an 
atmosphere of aggressive demands 
last month rabbi avraham weiss of riverdale ny and six of 
his students protested in front of the convent and were beaten and 
dragged from the site by construction workers at the convent 
weiss said thursday that macharskis claim was despicable 
and antisemitic he said if the nuns were not moved he would lead 
protest groups to poland and urge jews not to travel there 
an estimated 25 million jews were among the 4 million people 
the nazis killed at auschwitz in world war ii 
the international jewish community considers christian symbols 
on the perimeter of the camp a desecration of the memory of their 
slain brethren the convent is in a former nazi warehouse whose 
lawn used to be a gravel pit where prisoners were executed today 
a 23foot cross stands at the site 
the israeli foreign ministry said it learned of macharskis 
statement only in news reports and was still awaiting a report from 
the head of israels interest office in warsaw mordechai paltzur 
although it is true that the foreign ministry is not part of 
the february 1987 agreement it supports the implementation of 
this agreement and we have no reason to believe that the 
signatories would not respect it the ministry said 
it said palzur met three weeks ago with the polish officials and 
was promised that the polish government planned to intervene to 
implement the agreement 
israels minister of religious affairs zevullun hammer is to 
visit poland soon and will discuss the issue with his polish 
counterpart and macharski said the ministry of religious affairs 
director zevullun orlev 
we will explain morally that the auschwitz death camp is first 
and foremost a jewish site orlev said

steinway tries to run an upright piano factory 
but a pack of lowdown cats with the run of the place are sounding a 
sour note at night 
the stray cats appear to view the handcrafted 50000 pianos 
inside as nothing more than fine outhouses and scratching posts so 
officials of the queens plant are singing the blues and setting cat 
traps 
factory workers report theyre catching about eight cats each 
week inside the building that sounds about right i dont think 
thats high said leo spellman a steinway spokesman 
the kitty capers are a first at the plant which opened in 1870 
and the problem gets worse for steinway because it sets back the 
slow painstaking effort which goes into making their pianos 
a steinway grand piano the model favored by vladimir horowitz 
van cliburn and other maestros takes dozens of workers a full 
year to create but their efforts can be undone in a single night 
of feline revelry said factory superintendent ron penatzer 
if the cats use a piano soundboard to relieve themselves it 
takes six weeks and costs 2000 to repair the piece he said 
spellman said the company did not have an estimate on how much the 
kitties had cost it 
the cats hide out on the 10acre facility until the workers 
depart at 430 pm when they return the next morning the workers 
find pianos covered with paw prints scratches or or you 
know 
company officials blame an illegal dump on an adjacent lot for 
the problem the dump attracts rats which in turn bring in the 
cats which use the factory to unwind after dining 
when traps snare a furry prey steinway workers return the cats 
to their dump home leaving them free to make a return engagement 
the following night through the aging complexs many nooks and 
crannies 
the company has told the city about the problem and even 
volunteered to clean the site itself but their complaints have 
fallen on deaf ears spellman said 
department of sanitation spokesman vito turso said the deadend 
street sounds like a classic place for illegal dumping adding 
that the most the city can do is police the area once or twice a 
year 
unfortunately for steinway that hasnt been enough to keep 
their factory felinefree 
we dont like it its not extensive not in any way affecting 
the manufacturing but its embarrassing said spellman we 
wish the city would clean it up and put this to rest

rescue workers today found no trace 
of us rep mickey lelands plane in areas where two distress 
signals were detected and they resumed looking along its intended 
flight path the us embassy said 
the houston democrat and 15 other people were aboard the 
twinengine twin otter when it disappeared monday on a flight from 
addis ababa to the fugnido refugee camp 480 miles to the southwest 
near the sudanese border 
leland chairman of the house select committee on hunger was 
one of nine americans aboard the flight 
james haley an embassy spokesman said rescue workers on foot 
and in planes scoured rugged highlands north and southeast of 
ethiopias capital where the distress signals were detected by 
satellites thursday and early today 
two giant c130 hercules cargo planes left the capital shortly 
before 7 am to check the areas but by midday they were diverted 
to a region several hundred miles southwest of addis ababa that 
put the main area of the search back along the intended flight path 
of the plane 
they have pretty well exhausted those areas and theyre going 
back and concentrating the search to the southwest of the 
capital haley said 
haley said us authorities increased their count of those 
traveling with leland from 13 to 15 no reason was immediately 
given 
in washington officials with the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said a satellite was unable to detect a 
third signal when it flew over the area later this morning 
by midmorning bad weather had forced suspension of the aerial 
search in an area near goba 85 miles southeast of the capital 
where the first signal was detected heavy clouds rain and low 
visibility have prevented evening aerial searches since the rescue 
mission began four days ago 
both signals detected by the satellite were significantly off 
the planes intended flight plan and officials have said they may 
have come from other sources however haley said bad weather may 
have forced lelands pilot to seek a different route to the refugee 
camp 
the latest signal detected about 1 am 6 pm edt was read 
as coming from about 100 miles northwest of addis ababa directly 
opposite the direction lelands party was headed when its plane 
disappeared in bad weather 
thursdays signal was about 90 degrees off the line of the 
flight plan 
the canadianbuilt plane which seats up to 20 passengers was 
owned by ethiopias government relief agency it was equipped with 
an emergency locator transmitter a device usually mounted in the 
tail of an aircraft and activated either automatically by impact or 
manually by the pilot 
depending on its type an emergency locator transmits either an 
intermittent or steady signal on a fixed frequency allowing 
searchers to pinpoint the location of a downed aircraft 
for the last three days the search has centered on inaccessible 
regions in southwestern ethiopia where peasants reportedly heard 
planes circling remote fields 100 miles north and southeast of 
fugnido on monday 
the area is a region of foothills stretching into swamps that 
reach toward ethiopias border with sudan 
us officials have acknowledged lelands plane could have 
crashed into one of the many mountains along its path some of the 
peaks are higher than 12000 feet 
haley said there were eight other americans aboard including 
three members of lelands staff a friend of the congressman three 
officials of the us agency for international development and the 
spouse of one agency official also aboard were an ethiopian 
employee of the us embassy three ethiopian officials and a crew 
of three 
the spouse had earlier been counted as a us employee and the 
ethiopian employee of the embassy and a third crew member were 
added to the passenger list 
in washington lelands press secretary alma newsom said a 
congressional delegation sent by house speaker thomas foley 
dwash arrived in addis ababa this morning and was briefed on the 
search

percent from 1987 individual income taxes accounted for 80 
billion up 5 percent while corporate net income taxes rose 6 
percent to 22 billion 
the general sales tax is still the primary revenue source in 
most states accounting for more revenue than any other tax source 
in 23 of the 50 states the department said and in 18 of the 
39 states which impose both a general sales tax and an individual 
income tax 
the individual income tax is the primary source of tax revenue 
in 24 states while the severance tax is the primary source in 
alaska and wyoming it added 
the commerce report included data on state taxes only most of 
which was collected by a canvass of state offices revenue from 
nontax sources such as federal government payments was not 
included 
in addition the report did not include figures for the real 
estate taxes that are a primary source of revenue for local as 
opposed to state governments

buses stopped running and plants halted production 
today in gdansk as solidarity staged a onehour strike demanding 
compensation for recent price increases and an end to political 
favoritism in factories 
the general strike in the baltic port city which union 
spokesmen said affected hundreds of workplaces was the first 
provincewide action taken by solidarity since it was legalized in 
april after a sevenyear ban 
in italy meanwhile two key solidarity political leaders 
reiterated the labor movements demand to head the government but 
raised the possibility of including reformminded communists in a 
governing coalition 
in an editorial today the polish government newspaper 
rzeczpospolita renewed its call for a grand coalition 
government that would include solidarity and the communists 
but the opposition paper gazeta wyborcza stressed that only a 
solidarityled government would bring about the social 
reawakening necessary for reconstruction after the catastrophe 
the protest action today from noon to 1 pm was joined by the 
communistlinked trade union federation opzz in the province which 
said it approved of solidaritys economic demands 
i can see through the window that city transport has 
stopped said a spokesman at solidaritys gdansk information 
agency speaking by telephone shortly after noon trams and buses 
have stopped i see people waiting at bus stops 
krzysztof dowgiallo of the solidarity regional council in gdansk 
estimated that 500 enterprises planned to strike and it appeared 
the action was successful he said the city had become quiet and 
banners were hanging from many factories proclaiming the strike 
the protest was aimed at achieving six economic and political 
demands 
increasing planned pay compensation for recent food price 
increases of up to 300 percent 
ending monopolies in the purchase and distribution of 
agricultural products 
stopping the financing of political or union organizations by 
enterprises such as factorylevel communist groups 
liquidating the nomenklatura the system by which 
promotions to management are nearly always given to party loyalists 
creation of union rights for employees whose plants are 
subordinated to the defense and police ministries 
speeding up the holding of local council elections to be held 
for the first time on a totally democratic basis 
solidarity chapters in the northwestern port of szczecin and the 
southern city of katowice said they would stage similar onehour 
protests wednesday 
todays strike came a day after solidarity began talks with two 
minor parties who hold the balance of power in parliament about 
forming a solidarity government as urged this week by the 
movements leader lech walesa 
bronislaw geremek and adam michnik who were received by 
polishborn pope john paul ii at the popes castel gandolfo summer 
palace stressed in interviews thursday with italian television 
that the key was for solidarity to head the next government but 
that it could include communists 
that which was offered to us participation in a government 
headed by communists means the perpetuation of the regime said 
geremek the no 2 solidarity political leader after walesa 
the only government that can appear credible in the eyes of 
the polish people is an executive headed by solidarity in coalition 
with all the reformist forces in the country including communist 
reformers said michnik one of walesas closest strategists 
geremek explained in the interview that solidarity feels forced 
by the economic crisis especially the sharp increase in food 
prices aug 1 to accelerate its longrange timetable for taking 
power 
we asked ourselves do we have time to wait the answer we 
gave ourselves is no there is no more time geremek said 
as solidarity works to form a government newly elected 
communist prime minister czeslaw kiszczak is pressing on with his 
search for a cabinet to present to the sejm or parliament walesa 
has said he will urge solidarity lawmakers to reject any government 
led by kiszczak

victims were among 85 people arrested in a series of raids in july 
and accused of being communist rebels 
gaduang said they signed affidavits claiming they were tortured 
during their first two days of detention 
efforts to contact military officials for comment were 
unsuccessful 
of the 85 people arrested 60 have been released the 25 still 
in custody have not been charged gaduang said although philippine 
law requires that suspects be charged within 48 hours of arrest or 
freed

alex boncayao brigade which has taken responsibility for killing 
hundreds of police officers and soldiers in the capital in the last 
three years

retail sales are viewed as a measure of economic health since 
they account for about onethird of the nations economic activity 
the economy has slowed over the past year as the federal reserve 
drove interest rates higher to head off inflation spending on 
durable goods bigticket items such as cars expected to last more 
than three years has been particularly affected by the feds 
credittightening measures 
the fed switched course in june however and since then has 
nudged interest rates lower in an effort to keep the economy out of 
a recession

june bounced back 27 percent last month their best month since 
rising 47 percent in october 1988 auto sales posted a 07 percent

a conservative christian group asked a 
federal judge to prohibit police from using painful arrest methods 
against antiabortion protesters 
the request for a temporary restraining order was filed thursday 
by the rutherford institute of california on behalf of operation 
rescue supporters who have attempted to block abortion clinics and 
slow down police efforts to arrest them by such tactics as going 
limp and even smearing their arms with petroleum jelly 
a hearing on the request was scheduled this afternoon before 
us district judge a wallace tashima 
our case is really not if you will an abortion rights 
case said samuel b casey of the rutherford institute he 
described the complaint as a civil rights case that arises under 
the fourth amendment to the constitution which protects citizens 
from unreasonable seizure 
the rights that we seek to vindicate are equally valuable to 
any kind of peaceful nonviolent demonstrator casey said 
the suit was filed casey said because he believes police are 
using pain compliance techniques such as bending a wrist or arm 
backward against the joint in escalating fashion against 
antiabortion demonstrators the group is trying to block the use 
of such tactics at a deminstration planned for saturday 
police will argue against any attempt to prohibit officers from 
using the force necessary to make arrests said cmdr william 
booth a police spokesman 
a police department can hardly function and society can hardly 
have effective order if those who are to be arrested dictate the 
terms of their arrest booth said 
the law provides for us to use the amount of force necessary 
to make an arrest and the courts have interpreted that to mean the 
amount of force needed to overcome the arrestees resistance to 
arrest 
however booth said police will protect the rights of 
demonstrators who exercise their rights to free speech and 
assembly providing the protest is lawful 
police in los angeles are using painful arrest techniques to 
counter operation rescues strategy of illegally blocking the 
entrances to abortion clinics and delaying arrests to keep them 
closed as long as possible to accomplish this operation rescue 
protesters are taught to resist passively by going limp like a rag 
doll or flexing their muscles rigidly 
others smear petroleum jelly on their arms and legs to make it 
more difficult for officers to carry them to paddy wagons 
police made arrests during operation rescue protests in los 
angeles on june 10 and march 25 because the demonstrators were 
blocking abortion clinics in defiance of a federal court order

outgoing president pw botha 
said today he was not consulted about a diplomatic mission to 
zambia his heir apparent plans to make indicating a deepening rift 
between the two 
fw de klerk expected to succeed botha in september responded 
to bothas complaint by calling an urgent meeting of his fellow 
cabinet ministers he said he had not been able to arrange an 
appointment with botha to discuss the possible misunderstanding 
zambian president kenneth kaunda announced thursday that he 
would meet aug 28 with de klerk leader of the governing national 
party 
the planned meeting in livingstone zambia was confirmed by 
south african foreign minister pik botha who said he also would 
attend the foreign minister said the meeting was arranged after 
consultations with president botha 
however the president issued a terse statement contradicting 
the foreign minister 
i am not aware in terms of the rules governing overeas 
journeys by cabinet ministers of the discussions to be held 
as announced by dr kaunda president bothas statement said 
the independent south african press association said the 
presidents bombshell statement had plunged the national party 
into a preelection crisis andries treurnicht leader of the 
farright conservative party said the administration was in 
total chaos 
the presidents spokesman jack viviers told the agency that 
botha was at his office in cape town asked why cabinet ministers 
were unable to meet him viviers replied i dont know ask 
them 
foreign ministry officials said they were trying to reach pik 
botha for an explanation the two bothas are not related 
attempts by ministers to arrange an urgent appointment with 
the state president in order to attempt to clear up the matter have 
so far been unsuccessful de klerk said in a statement in the 
light of these facts i am in the process of calling an urgent 
meeting of all available national party ministers for the earliest 
opportunity 
botha technically is in charge of the cabinet but de klerk also 
has some authority over the ministers because all of them are 
national party members 
relations between president botha and de klerk have been uneasy 
since february when botha resigned as national party leader after 
suffering a stroke party leaders subsequently threw their support 
behind de klerk 
botha last year launched an unprecedented diplomatic initiative 
into black africa holding summit meetings with the presidents of 
mozambique zaire and the ivory coast 
de klerk expected to succeed botha after parliamentary 
elections sept 6 has continued the initiative meeting recently 
with mozambiques president joaquim chissano 
his planned meeting with kaunda is seen as particularly 
significant since the zambian is chairman of the frontline states 
a sixnation group established for the purpose of confronting south 
africas white rulers 
kaunda has led calls for isolation of south africa until its 
policy of apartheid which bars the black majority from having a 
voice in national affairs is abolished 
kuandas country also is headquarters for the african national 
congress the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the south 
african government

the army today doubled to one year the period 
for which palestinians can be held without trial or indictment 
marking a renewed effort to quell the 20month palestinian uprising 
the army said the order issued by defense minister yitzhak 
rabin and approved by justice minister dan meridor was made for 
security reasons and in accordance with the situation existing 
these days in the occupied territories 
we are in a war and sometimes residents or citizens rights 
are harmed in the course of a war we have to find the right 
balance so that the damage would not be too serious but on the 
other hand we have to allow the army to fight and win that war 
meridor said on israel radio 
israel adopted the administrative detention procedure from 1945 
emergency regulations used by the british during their rule of 
mandatory palestine often against jews fighting for the creation 
of a jewish state 
the united states and human rights organizations have condemned 
the procedure as a violation of due process 
in numerous cases detention has been extended to more than one 
sixmonth term but army officials have demanded a freer hand 
complaining that judicial procedures complicate their fight against 
the uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
at least 534 palestinians have been killed by soldiers and 
settlers during the uprising thirtyeight israelis have also died 
the army command said a person detained without trial for more 
than six months will be entitled to bring his case to a judge who 
deals with both military and civilian matters at least once in six 
months 
israel defends detention without trial as an effective means of 
arresting violent ringleaders without having to reveal sources of 
information but attorneys complain they cannot respond to 
unspecified secret charges against palestinian suspects 
a us state department report on human rights released in 
february criticized the procedure it also disputed israeli claims 
saying that in many cases palestinians were detained for political 
reasons or nonviolent activities 
the report also said that some 20 percent of detention orders 
have been renewed after the initial six months 
according to army figures released today 9136 palestinians are 
jailed for uprisingrelated offenses 2111 of them are in 
administrative detention 
joshua schoffman of the association for civil rights in israel 
a private group said the new step could just be a way of the 
army showing it is getting tougher 
schoffman said his group filed a supreme court appeal thursday 
claiming that the army fails to notify arab families of the arrest 
of relatives and their place of detention making it harder to 
provide legal assistance or visit jailed relatives 
meanwhile the governmentrun central bureau of statistics said 
that despite the uprising the population of jewish settlements in 
the occupied lands is 6500 higher than last year 
it reported that 66500 jews lived in the territories in late 
1988 an increase of 103 percent over 1987 others claim the 
figure is higher or lower and has been manipulated for political 
reasons 
about 15 million palestinians live in the west bank and gaza

a united nations official today 
dismissed claims by the swapo movement that south africa is 
planning to rig namibias elections by bringing in 100000 people 
to vote 
swapo the southwest africa peoples organization fought a 
23year bush war against south african rule of namibia and is 
favored in novembers preindependence polls 
but swapos un observer hinyangerwa asheeke said thursday 
that a loophole in namibias election law allows up to 100000 
south africans with namibia ties to vote and that another 50000 
angolans belonging to the unita rebel movement will be fraudulently 
registered 
south africa supported unita or the national union for the 
total independence of angola in its battle against angolas 
marxist government until a regional peace treaty was signed last 
year 
we have no evidence to support swapos allegations said 
hisham omayad of ghana the united nations electoral director in 
namibia 
omayad said only 1560 south africans have registered in namibia 
under a proposed election law that extends voting rights to anyone 
who has lived in the territory for the past four years or longer 
regardless of nationality 
people who were born in namibia but now live elsewhere also 
would be allowed to vote under the proposed law 
un officials have said previously there is no evidence of 
angolan citizens coming to namibia to register 
voter registration began in early july and ends sept 15 more 
than 500000 of the 700000 people expected to register have done 
so un officials said 
the election law remains open for public comment and still must 
be approved by martti ahtisarri who heads the un operation in 
namibia 
omayad also said that people are required to show birth 
certificates when they register and swapo could challenge in court 
any voters they believe were registered fraudulently 
thousands of south africans have served in namibia over the 
years as soldiers or civil servants but most have left and only a 
fraction of those remaining meet the fouryear residency 
requirement 
asheeke suggested swapo would not recognize the results of an 
election that is not free and fair 
we are forewarning the international community to a very 
dangerous situation he said 
pretoria proceeded with enacting this election law obviously 
with the connivance of ahtisaari said asheeke apparently 
unaware that ahtisaari has yet to rule on the proposed legislation 
african nations called for the un security council to meet 
monday to discuss the deteriorating situation in namibia 
ghanaian ambassador jv gbeho made the request in a letter to the 
councils president 
novembers election will choose a constituent assembly which 
will write a constitution and organize a government if swapo can 
win twothirds of the vote it can write the consititution by 
itself

a special crossborder police unit nabbed a 
lebanese man accused of being a drug kingpin and whisked him to 
israel officials said today 
thursday nights operation came exactly two weeks after israeli 
commandos abducted a shiite moslem clergyman in south lebanon and 
flew him to israel 
the capture of mohammed berro appeared unrelated to obeids 
kidnapping which was aimed at arranging a prisoner swap 
department chief rami zutler of the severe crimes division told 
a tel aviv court today that berro is one of the biggest drug 
dealers in lebanon the national news agency itim said 
the court remanded berro in custody for 15 days it said 
when asked by the judge how berro 46 had arrived in israel 
from lebanon zutler replied that the police had transferred 
him 
zutler alleged that berro was responsible for smuggling 462 
pounds of heroin seized last week in israels biggest drug bust 
zutler also said berro was wanted by egypt for drug smuggling 
reports from egypt said that in june berro was sentenced in 
absentia to death for attempting to smuggle 41 tons of opium 18 
tons of hashish and 635 pounds of heroin into egypt 
security sources in lebanon said israeli civilian police have 
been operating in israels selfdeclared security zone in southern 
lebanon for at least six months 
police spokeswoman ruth schlesinger said a joint police and 
military unit is conducting antismuggling operations along 
israels northern border and in the security zone 
the zone was carved out by israel in 1985 after it pulled the 
majority of its troops out of lebanon following the 1982 invasion 
the zone is patrolled by about 1500 israeli troops backed by 
israels militia allies 
there are approximately 5000 drug addicts receiving treatment 
in israel but there are no accurate figures on the numbers of drug 
users in the country the supply of drugs coming in from lebanon 
has risen sharply in recent years 
until 1978 drug usage in israel was confined to hashish 
traditionally smuggled from lebanon but in 1982 lebanese dealers 
began to produce heroin and israeli drug dealers began distributing 
it 
the contact was made easier after israels invasion of lebanon

the spiritual guide of the proiranian 
group hezbollah today offered to help free western hostages held in 
lebanon if the west helps release arab prisoners held in israel 
let us get to an agreement together so that each side would 
use his own means and influence to end the crisis of the hostages 
all hostages and resolve the problem of arab prisoners said 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah during a sermon at beiruts bir 
elabed mosque 
i am ready to help free the western hostages provided that 
western countries help release lebanese and palestinian prisoners 
in israel he said 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for shiite moslem 
factions holding most of the 16 hostages in lebanon 
fadlallah did not mention any names but his comments were 
similar to an offer made earlier this month by the revolutionary 
justice organization a proiranian group that holds american 
hostage joseph cicippio 
it said it would free cicippio if israel freed sheik abdul karim 
obeid a shiite moslem clergyman israel kidnapped july 28 and 450 
arab prisoners it also demanded that israel allow 55 palestinians 
deported in connection with the antiisraeli uprising in the 
occupied territories to return home 
during his speech fadlallah also praised a bombing attack 
carried out by a shiite moslem cleric in retaliation for israels 
abduction of obeid 
five israeli soldiers and an allied militiaman were injured 
wednesday when a shiite moslem clergyman sheik asaad birro 
detonated a truck bomb as an israeli military patrol passed in 
southern lebanon birro was killed 
sheik asaad birro has by his attack knocked down the theory 
of a security zone fadlallah said referring to the 6 to 
10milewide strip of land israel carved out in south lebanon to 
protect itself from guerrilla raids 
hezbollah also released a videotape made of birro before the 
attack 
in it birro said my operation is a gift for the nation of 
hezbollahand the heroes of the uprising against the cancerous 
nation israel 
i hope it will be a modest step toward the elimination of the 
zionist entity he added birro appeared nervous stumbling on 
some words as he tensely clutched a prepared text 
in israel today prime minister yitzhak shamir told us 
congressmen he is optimistic israel can negotiate the release of 
missing israeli soldiers and american hostages in lebanon 
rep john hiler told reporters after the hourlong meeting that 
shamir said he was hopeful what was taking place would lead to 
the release of the captives 
the indiana republican attended the session with rep robert 
clement a democrat from tennessee and rep william emerson a 
republican from missouri they are touring israel as guests of the 
antidefamation league of the bnai brith 
hiler quoted shamir as saying there were ongoing 
negotiations but he gave no specifics officials have said 
contacts with shiite moslems have been made but no negotiations 
were under way 
the foreign hostages include eight americans the hostage held 
longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
on july 31 a proiranian group claimed it killed one hostage 
us marine lt col william r higgins in retaliation for 
israels refusal to free obeid 
israel said it kidnapped obeid to swap him for three israeli 
soldiers held in south lebanon and the western hostages 
fadlallah made his comments in a sermon marking the anniversary 
of the death of shiite moslems most revered saint imam hussein 
bin ali grandson of the prophet mohammed

a braniff airways flight from new york to 
florida made a safe emergency landing at newark international 
airport today after a warning light indicated a hydraulics problem 
officials said 
we had nothing but a faulty warning system said braniff 
spokesman don mcguire in orlando fla 
he said the incident drew exaggerated attention after an airport 
spokesman reported that the boeing 727s primary hydraulic system 
failed and that the plane landed using a secondary system mcguire 
said it was the warning light not the system itself that had 
failed 
rescue crews stood by as the plane landed safely about 930 am 
one passenger robert schoeppler of new york said that after 
landing the captain announced one of the hydraulics systems 
conked out 
there were 99 passengers and a crew of seven aboard flight 341 
which had taken off a short time before from new yorks la guardia 
airport bound for orlando 
hydraulics systems enable the pilot to operate the wing flaps 
and other equipment large jets are designed so if one fails the 
plane can still fly on backup hydraulics systems 
a failure of all three hydraulics systems on a dc10 en route 
from denver to chicago was blamed for last months crash landing of 
a united airlines jet at sioux city iowa that killed 111 people 
in that case the systems failed after an engine disintegrated in 
flight and bits of metal damaged the hydraulics lines

william c lucas whose nomination as the 
governments civil rights chief died earlier this month in the 
senate today was named to a justice department post that does not 
require confirmation by lawmakers 
attorney general richard thornburgh named lucas a former fbi 
agent and sheriff of wayne county mich as director of the 
departments office of liaison services 
the appointment eliminates a potential source of friction 
between the bush administration and the democratic majority of the 
senate the senate judiciary committee killed lucas selection as 
assistant attorney general for civil rights on a tie vote and also 
refused to permit the full senate to vote on it 
bush had been urged by some republicans to name lucas a black 
to the highranking post during the current congressional recess a 
move that would have allowed him to serve until the end of next 
year without confirmation democratic leaders expressed strong 
opposition to such a move in a white house session with the 
president 
opponents to his earlier nomination said lucas lacked a strong 
commitment to civil rights concerns and said he didnt have the 
experience needed for such an important administrative job 
lucas new job will make him coordinator of justice department 
activities with state and local governments and civil rights 
organizations 
thornburgh said in a statement that lucas 61 will be in 
charge of coordinating cooperative efforts in law enforcement 
civil rights and the administration of justice with our working 
partners in both the public and private sectors 
lucas will act as my personal representative in dealing with 
persons and organizations on those matters thornburgh said 
administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said bush would formally withdraw lucas nomination for the civil 
rights job later today no replacement has been selected they said 
in 77 tie votes aug 1 the senate judiciary committee rejected 
motions to recommend lucas confirmation and to send his name to 
the full senate without recommendation 
bush had considered appointing lucas to the civil rights post 
while congress is in recess a manuever that would have permitted 
lucas to serve through 1990 without requiring a senate vote 
however senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine warned 
bush a week ago that such a move could harm the presidents 
relations with congress 
bush then sought a quick floor vote on lucas before senators 
left town but mitchell turned him down 
lucas who served as a sheriff and county executive in the 
detroit area was widely criticized by civil rights groups for 
lacking the experience in discrimination cases required for the 
assistant attorney general post 
lucas has recently been working in the justice department as a 
consultant 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush values mr lucas friendship and advice and will seek it 
and use it in the years ahead 
fitzwater said the president continues to believe that the 
rejection by lucas on capitol hill for the highprofile civil 
rights post was a very unfair judgment by congress based 
primarily on political considerations 
the president thinks he was an excellent candidate who would 
do a great for whoever he works for fitzwater said 
he was a black leader in michigan who gave up the democratic 
party and joined the republican party we felt his background and 
experience was sound and he would have done a great job

psychological distress may stimulate the 
diseasefighting immune system in men with early aids virus 
infection the opposite of its apparent effect in people with 
fullblown aids a study suggests 
that may mean the impact of anxiety depression and fatigue 
depends on how well the immune system is able to respond to such 
distress said researcher lydia temoshok 
it also fits in with a recent suggestion that the aids virus may 
overstimulate the immune system early on leading to its later 
exhaustion and collapse she said if that is true strategies to 
spur the immune system of infected people may have to be timed to 
avoid overstimulation she said 
aids kills by crippling the bodys immune system leaving a 
person vulnerable to fatal illnesses some researchers are studying 
whether programs to help deal with stress can help infected people 
maintain their immune systems possibly slowing the progression of 
the disease or increasing survival times 
temoshok is a senior scientist at the walter reed army institute 
of research in washington she did the new research at the 
university of california at san francisco with colleagues there and 
from the university of california at los angeles 
she spoke in an interview before presenting the work friday at 
the annual meeting of the american psychological association 
arthur laperriere research assistant professor of psychiatry at 
the university of miami school of medicine called temoshoks study 
preliminary but he said it may indicate that psychological 
intervention can affect the immune systems of people at the stage 
of infection she studied 
research at his school found that infected men who had no 
symptoms showed an increase in immune system white blood cells 
after participating in a program that included progressive muscle 
relaxation and psychological therapies he said 
temoshok said her work shows only a correlation between distress 
levels and activity of the immune system suggesting but not 
proving any cause and effect 
previously her work had linked higher levels of psychological 
distress with lower levels of immune system activity in men with 
fullblown acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
but just the opposite relationship appeared in the new study of 
103 men who showed at least one aidsrelated symptom but not the 
full disease 
distress was measured with standard tests of anxiety depression 
and fatigue measures of the immune system included numbers of 
tcells which are white blood cells that are a key target of the 
aids virus and of other white cells researchers also measured the 
potency of immune system blood cells called natural killer cells 
most immune system measures were significantly higher in men 
with more anxiety depression and fatigue temoshok said 
other studies suggest that distress has the opposite effect on 
healthy people whose immune systems become depressed 
the researchers do not yet know if the stimulated immune system 
has any effect on the progression to fullblown aids she said so 
it is not clear what psychological treatment if any would be 
useful she said 
a possible explanation for the divergent findings of the two 
studies is that the impact of distress may depend on the immune 
system of a person infected with the aids virus she said 
perhaps the relatively wellfunctioning immune system of a 
person with only early aids symptoms responds by being stimulated 
while the more crippled immune system of a person with fullblown 
aids can only be suppressed she said

two former east german border guards who fled to 
the west said friday that communist authorities have ordered 
frontier patrols not to shoot at escaping civilians 
the shoottokill orders were lifted in april and east german 
border guards have been told to use their weapons only in 
selfdefense to prevent desertions and in cases where wouldbe 
escapees used heavy equipment to break through the heavily 
fortified border the two said 
east germanys communist party leader erich honecker told the 
washington post in june that the orders had been lifted 
falk turba a former border guard who escaped july 12 said that 
according to his superiors the killing of wouldbe escapees caused 
more political damage than if the escape suceeded 
former guard carsten kuehnast said the new orders were imprecise 
since they did not specify what was considered to be heavy 
equipment 
working group august 13 an organization that monitors human 
rights in east germany said that since the walls construction in 
1961 191 east germans died in escape attempts according to its 
latest figures 218283 east germans have succeeded including

an east german interflug jet 
arrived friday in this west german business center completing the 
first exchange of commerical flights in the 40 years since the 
nation was divided 
heinz ruhnau head of west germanys lufthansa airline that 
inaugurated a frankfurttoleipzig service thursday deemed the new 
routes a step toward normality 
but despite the new services aimed at shuttling passengers from 
both sides among the major business cities a remnant of the cold 
war continues to encumber both national carriers neither lufthansa 
nor interflug is allowed to fly over the border between the 
countries so they must detour to the south and fly through 
czechoslovak airspace 
under a postworld war ii agreement among the western allies 
only france britain and the united states are allowed to provide 
air service between west germany and west berlin and they must

the bush administration said today it wants to 
take a lower profile on efforts to free american hostages in 
lebanon while discussions flow back and forth 
bush has a sense of urgency on the overall situation but the 
most important traits right now are patience and determination to 
not let urgency push you to say things or do things that would be 
counterproductive said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
we just dont have anything new today its a long process and 
we need to be patient and let discussions flow back and forth 
but theres just no new developments he told reporters 
we would like to lower our voices a little and let these 
issues play out for a few days and see what happens fitzwater 
said 
he was asked about remarks in beirut by the spiritual guide of 
the proiranian group hezbollah sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
who offered to help free western hostages held in lebanon if the 
west helps release arab prisoners held in israel 
its an interesting statement we dont have any comment on 
it we hope it signals their desire to release the hostages 
he said 
fitzwater said there appeared to be no prospects for talks with 
the hezbollah believed to be the umbrella organization for shiite 
moslem factions holding most of the 16 hostages in lebanon 
we always said wed talk to anybody and seek any avenue for 
getting the release of the hostages but theres never really been 
an opportunity for direct discussions with the hostage holders 
fitzwater said partly they havent wanted to weve said we 
wont negotiate for hostages it just hasnt been fruitful 
fitzwater said thursday that the administration stands ready to 
talk to any party that can help win freedom for the middle east 
hostages including iran but it is premature to expect direct 
talks with the new government in tehran 
we want to keep the lines of communication open he said 
we are prepared to talk to any party that can help with release 
of the hostages including iran 
to talk directly with tehran however he added the united 
states would have to be sure it was dealing with authoritative 
officials who represented the government he suggested it was 
premature to expect such talks now adding were nowhere near 
that 
bush himself had nothing to say thursday about the hostages 
expect to repeat his appeal to americans to offer a special prayer 
for them this weekend 
fitzwater said the united states welcomes thirdparty contacts 
with iran on the hostages including a trip to tehran planned next 
week by the foreign minister of pakistan sahabzada yaqub khan 
fitzwater taking note of a report thursday in the 
englishlanguage tehran times that indirect talks would open in a 
few days through a third country possibly pakistan said he was 
unaware of any special new talks 
fitzwater said khan and other pakistani officials have contacts 
in iran and it is the administrations policy to leave no stone 
unturned in seeking to win freedom of the us hostages 
fitzwater said he could not supply details of khans trip khan 
made an unexpected visit to washington last week where he met with 
vice president dan quayle 
the vice president urged pakistan to become involved in 
helping facilitate the release of the hostages and to reveal to 
iran information that pakistan has accumulated on the situation 
said quayle spokesman david beckwith 
fitzwater told reporters the united states and israel were 
discussing efforts to free their hostages in lebanon but were not 
coordinating their actions 
israeli officials had said israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir persuaded bush in a 10minute telephone call wednesday to 
coordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and israeli 
prisoners held in lebanon 
weve generally tried to be forthcoming with what we are 
doing and they have been forthcoming with what theyre doing 
however i would not characterize it as coordination fitzwater 
said

thunderstorms crossing from california into nevada today left 
homes flooded mudslides imperiled yellowstone visitors and 
arizonas governor toured areas of yuma where there were lakes 
where cars had been 
widely scattered downpours wednesday and thursday deluged areas 
from san diego to las vegas the aqueduct supplying most of los 
angeles water overflowed some roads and highways in the eastern 
sierra nevada range where deputies rescued several motorists from 
high water remained closed today 
heavy rain and hail at yellowstone national park wyo caused 
three major mudslides and 12 smaller ones that mired 30 vehicles in 
waistdeep mud and swept one family inside of a camper into a 
raging river thursday evening 
it was a matter of seconds virtually seconds and that 
vehicle would have gone under said park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
after talking to a park ranger who rescued the family visiting from 
mexico 
no one was injured but paul lauze a meteorologist for the 
national weather service in cheyenne cautioned that there could be 
more slides today everybody watch out its going to be the same 
thing he said 
the problem is aggravated in yellowstone national park because 
of the exposed terrain as the result of the forest fires last 
year he said 
arizona gov rose mofford declared yuma county a disaster area 
thursday after touring areas where homes were flooded by up to 4 
feet of water from a storm wednesday night the desert town got 
more rain in an evening about 3 inches than it normally gets 
in a year 
there were lakes where cars had been and you could tell that 
businesses were wiped out mrs mofford said 
police threatened to ticket sightseers who drove through 
floodwaters creating waves that washed into homes and businesses 
police spokesman jan schmidt estimated 1000 homes were damaged 
but said there were no estimates of monetary losses this morning 
people are still digging out to figure out what got ruined 
he said we have homes that had four feet of water in them i 
know one man who had a swimming pool seven feet deep that was 
covered with sand he was standing on top of it it was filled in 
he said the national weather service reading of 35 inches of 
rain on a mesa overlooking the city was conservative 
down in the valley they had about 56 inches in 2 hours 
schmidt said 
on the south side of town they lost just about all the water 
pressure because the water eroded away the areas and what was left 
fell down and crushed the pipes schmidt said 
damage also was reported at the yuma marine corps air station 
in the desert just southeast of california where 2000 gallons of 
firefighting foam leaked during the storm it was like a washing 
machine gone wild gunnery sgt hal wheeler said 
in mono county calif between yosemite national park and the 
nevada line about 150 residents were evacuated thursday and at 
least 28 homes suffered moderate to severe water damage sheriff 
marty strelneck said 
a onemile section of the los angeles aqueduct that had been 
closed because of previous flooding filled with rain again and 
overflowed forcing a cleanup crew of 30 to evacuate officials 
said 
the section runs near the towns of olancha and cartago 180 
miles north of los angeles 
the aqueduct supplies 75 percent of los angeles water but 
reservoirs in the area have enough water to prevent a shortage in 
los angeles said dorothy jensen spokeswoman for the los angeles

he came close on several occasions he never made it 
until this year 
bessette who is attending the derby as part of the vermont 
delegation is part of what race organizers call a resurgence in 
the event that dates to the early 1930s 
jeff iula of the allamerican soap box derby said the race had 
its heyday in the late 1960s but is making a comeback now as the 
children of the baby boom generation begin to filter into the ranks 
he said there are about 5000 participants and qualifying races 
nationwide this year the finals are set for saturday 
vermont for example hadnt held a race since 1985 and hadnt 
held one in the states largest city since the 1950s but when 
bessette heard about the return of the soap box derby to vermont 
he was ready to roll 
his youngest child is 26 too old to race undeterred bessette 
rounded up two neighbors erik and travis holcomb and suggested 
they enter 
bessette would say that helping build the two cars was done 
mostly for the kids dont be fooled he enjoyed this as much as 
they did 
cars are my thing he said 
a section of bessettes garage was taken over by soap box 
construction the aroma of new paint hung in the air and odd wood 
pieces are tossed in piles atop one pile is the critical rule book 
and a road atlassized instruction book on building the racer 
these days everything is done according to stringent 
specifications in an attempt to make the race more evenhanded 
some kids may have a dad thats an ibm engeiner while other 
kids might have a dad that doesnt have that experience bessette 
said 
erik and travis can recite those rules and guidelines as easily 
as their address they know a car in their division cant weigh 
more than 206 pounds with one type of wheel cant be longer than 
80 inches and cant be less than 13 inches wide 
the wooden contraptions arent exactly furnished with fuel 
injection and front disc brakes gravity is the force that propels 
the cars down the selected hill while the brake is a piece of 
rubber bolted to a stick of wood that drops out of the floor like a 
trap door and drags along the ground 
derby cars have come a long way from the boxy models that once 
dotted the soap box circuit the holcombs cars looked like short 
kayaks with wheels the front of each car has a rounded nose like 
submarines and raindrops to cut down on air drag the two boys 
said 
you can get fooled too bessette warned sometimes a 
shoebox will clean house 
but the basic tenets of the race havent really changed even 
though the cars have said harley burger of the green mountain 
council boy scouts of america inc an organizer of the vermont 
rally 
they ran down a hill then they run down a hill now burger 
said the winner went to akron then the winner goes now 
bessette took the experience of being a soap box racer and built 
on it he owns a garage and has worked as a member of a pit crew 
for professional stock car racers 
and this year he raced at the derby in an oversized car 
designed for adults he said it was tough to scrunch down into a 
little ball and fit into the car but it all came back to him he 
beat a fellow vermonter norman turcotte 
i won a race at the derby bessette said with glee boy 
that was really exciting it really made my day

a frustrated spokeswoman for rep mickey 
leland said today she wasnt satisfied with the sense of 
urgency involved in the search for her boss and others missing 
since monday in ethiopia 
president bush and the state department said they understood the 
worried mood of the texas congressmans staff and defended the 
rescue effort 
lelands press secretary alma newsom said that with all of 
sophisticated equipment dispatched to ethiopia to search for the 
congressmans missing plane and his traveling party we could 
have and should have located them by now 
i certainly had a great deal more confidence in our 
capability she said lelands plane which also carried several 
congressional staff members and state department employees 
vanished monday after taking off from addis ababa for a refugee 
camp 480 miles away 
leland dtexas chairs the house select committee on hunger and 
has been a leader in congressional efforts to aid people displaced 
by war and famine in africa 
ms newsom said she was appealing to bush to get involved and 
to issue a strong statement to all of his people that this is a 
priority theyve got to work together and they have got to get 
their act together and find congressman leland and his party 
the president asked about the subject at a photo session in the 
oval office said 
i can understand the anxiety of all this and i can understand 
the concern that people that love mickey leland feel and that i 
feel but theres a lot going on so lets just hope and pray hes 
ok 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said i 
know the president and the secretary of state deeply and sincerely 
empathize with the frustration with the tension with the 
situation ms newsom is having to deal with 
ms newsom said i think there has been a problem of 
communication i think there has been a problem of somehow the 
sense of urgency from the top has not filtered considerably as it 
went down 
theres an obvious leadership or organizational vacuum here 
theres a missing link she said 
ms tutwiler also denied there had been any breakdown in the 
search effort 
rep alan wheat dmo one of two congressmen sent to ethiopia 
by house speaker thomas foley was briefed on the situation 
thursday and ms newsom said there was a general acknowledgment 
that more facilities were needed that more aircraft were needed 
that more helicopters were needed that particularly more personnel 
were needed that there were fliers needed pilots needed to spell 
the ones that are there 
ms newsom said she and others in lelands office had spent the 
night calling on other congressmen to urge the pentagon to move 
more quickly on the rescue effort saying time was of the essence 
and that there had been a lot of missteps and misstatements

charlene richard died 30 years ago today at 
the age of 12 from leukemia since her death many believe she has 
helped perform miracles and thousands now would like to have her 
canonized 
worshipers began arriving at her grave before noon for a mass 
tonight at st edward church the rev joseph brennan said 4000 
were expected to attend representing a growing sentiment among 
southern louisiana roman catholics to have the cajun girl made a 
saint 
we put our lawn chairs out early this morning so we would be 
sure to get a spot up front said charlenes mother mary 
richard weve been baking all morning to bring food to the hall 
its a big day not just for us but for everyone i guess 
paul olivier said he planned to attend to honor the memory of 
the girl whose miracle he believes helped save his own little 
girls life 
we had a child who was a year old and diagnosed as having 
cancer of the larynx the doctors said it was very rare but it was 
a killer they put her life span at three four five months at the 
most said olivier a retired state policeman then someone 
told us about charlene and we went to her grave and asked her to 
help us 
that was in 1970 today angela olivier is a 19yearold junior 
at the university of southeastern louisiana 
i would say that is a sign of a miracle olivier said a 
prayer was answered 
there is a box beside charlenes grave where those hoping for 
miracles can put their petitions a light burns at night for those 
who make the pilgrimage around the clock 
despite the growing adulation she has received since her death 
charlene was not a remarkable child said mrs richard 
she was full of life she liked sports and was always busy 
with something she went to church and said her rosary but she was 
just a normal little girl she said 
brennan said it was charlenes death that made her a saint he 
was chaplain at the lafayette hospital where she died in 1959 
charlene taught the world not how to live but how to die 
thirty years ago they didnt have the pain medicine they have now 
and she died in excruciating pain but in perfect grace she became 
great at that time he said 
the miracles began soon after charlenes death according to 
the rev floyd calais 
calais 62 then was the chaplain at a state hospital in 
lafayette in the heart of louisianas cajun country when he 
prayed to charlene asking her to inspire the bishop to assign him 
to a parish he was soon appointed pastor of the church where the 
girl was buried about 155 miles northwest of new orleans 
when i found out which church i had the hair on the back of 
my neck stood on end he said 
lucy and rogers courville often visit charlenes grave to thank 
her for saving the life of their daughter laurie now 15 who was 
diagnosed as having cancer at age 5 numerous others have told of 
cancer cures over the years 
the united states has produced only three saints and 
canonization is a lengthy process that can take centuries 
but the diocese of lafayette has begun the slow process of 
sainthood for charlene calais said the diocese is collecting 
peoples stories of how she helped them the first step to 
establishing miracles he said if the vatican considers charlene a 
candidate for sainthood she will be considered first for 
veneration beatification and finally canonization 
that really doesnt matter im sure that charlene is a saint 
im sure she is in heaven calais said 
for those who come to the grave canonization is just a 
formality 
for us she is already a saint said wilson daigle who 
credits charlenes intercession with helping his wife recover from 
a mental illness we talk to her and she understands us

panamas foreign minister today asked the 
security council to send military observers to his country to 
prevent the us army from instigating confrontations as a pretext 
for armed intervention 
jorge ritter said us forces have been leaving their bases for 
months to harass panamanian citizens and the republic of panama 
became de facto an invasion site in which only the order to fire 
is lacking 
what the situation in panama calls for is the presence of 
military observers which we hope would be able to go as early as 
next monday 
the testimony of observers to be designated will insure that 
the reality of the situation cannot be hidden and it will be 
recorded in the annals of history as a crime said ritter 
the united states as a permanent member of the security 
council would be able to veto any council resolution to send 
military observers to pamama 
panama did not have any nation on the council introduce a 
resolution which would be required to send observers 
in panama gen manuel antonio noriega on thursday said his 
regime will not yield to us pressure that he quit as panamas 
defense forces chief 
panama will not bow to the law of force that those barbarians 
from the north their lackeys and tame politicians are trying to 
impose on it he said thursday night referring to his panamanian 
opponents 
the comments were noriegas first reaction to a week of 
confrontations between his forces and us southern command troops 
that included arrests on both sides and the blocking of nearby fort 
amador by american soldiers 
us troops have been conducting exercises to defend the panama 
canal under the 1977 treaties and noriegas troops in some cases 
have been shadowing them 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today 
that the recent exercises were routine manuvers but he 
acknowledged they were to some degree a show of force 
we have always said that we would feel free to carry out 
exercises in support of our rights under the panama canal treaty 
from time to time we do conduct those kind of exercises he 
said theyre all designed to ensure our rights and acess to 
protect the canal 
addressing a group of 20 retired military officers noriega 
reiterated earlier accusations the united states wants to replace 
him with a docile government to elude treaty obligations to 
turn the panama canal over to panama 
you noriega said pointing at the retired officers are 
frontrow witnesses of the aggressive and arrogant policies of the 
united states towards panama but he said panama will not bow 
will not humiliate itself will not give up its project of 
liberating itself of american soldiers in the face of injustice 
or arrogance 
the group of officers believed to have been founded recently by 
noriega calls itself the executive committee of the organization 
of military men for democracy integration and the liberation of 
latin american and the caribbean 
the bush administration and opposition politicians have been 
trying to force out noriega since two federal grand juries in 
florida indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering 
charges last year 
us efforts have included diplomatic pressure and trade and 
economic sanctions against panama but the steps have yet to budge 
noriega whose regime annulled may 7 presidential elections 
international observers said opposition candidate guillermo endara 
won by a landslide

and was wanted by police in south carolina for escape 
baltimore circuit court judge elsbeth levy bothe and assistant 
states attorney jill myers said brown was eligible for a 25year 
sentence without the possibility of parole because of his criminal 
history 
as one of the taxpayers of the state of maryland i dont want 
to support him for the next 25 years bothe said its the only 
reason im willing to not impose the 25 years he so richly 
deserves

thousands of cambodians have thronged 
to see the killing fields the film that brought to western 
screens the horror of life under the khmer rouge since it 
premiered in phnom penh this month 
richard walden head of the us relief agency operation 
california that arranged the screening said friday that a day 
after the aug 4 premiere a crowd of up to 5000 people jostled for 
tickets at one of the capitals four movie theaters 
there was literally a human sea trying to get tickets there 
was almost a riot to get in walden said in an interview in 
bangkok 
walden led a delegation including the films british director 
roland joffe and the principal character us journalist sydney 
schanberg to phnom penh for the screening the delegation was 
invited by cambodian premier hun sen 
the film has been available in cambodia for some time on 
videotape but only this month were audiences able to view it in 
theaters 
the killing fields tells the story of how schanberg and his 
cambodian assistant dith pran were separated as the khmer rouge 
entered phnom penh in 1975 to begin their murderous rule the 
radical communist faction killed hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians between 1975 and 1978 
schanberg and dith eventually were reunited but only after dith 
made a hazardous trek to thailand though rice fields filled with 
the bones of the khmer rouges victims 
walden said the cambodian audience appeared thrilled to see 
cambodian actor haing ngor who won an academy award for best 
supporting actor for his portrayal of dith alongside western stars 
but many broke down in tears whan asked about their experiences 
later he said the reaction of many in the audience was that is 
all true that is what it was like for my family he said 
many said life under the khmer rouge was even worse than that 
portrayed in the movie walden said 
there was an incredible response especially in scenes which 
showed the khmer rouge which showed people marching out of phnom 
penh or working in the rural areas walden said 
he said the present government plans to continue showing the 
film hopefully outside the capital as well 
on april 17 1975 when the khmer rouge entered phnom penh they 
ordered the population of 2 million out of the city to work under 
slavish conditions in the countryside 
the capital was a ghost town for 3 years while the khmer rouge 
attempted to build a radical agrarian utopia 
although ousted by a vietnamese invasion in 1978 the khmer 
rouge still survives with its leadership structure intact backed 
by china it is currently the largest of three guerrilla groups 
fighting the cambodian government from bases on the thai border 
in recent peace talks hun sens government has insisted that the 
khmer rouge should not be allowed a role in the future of cambodia

the army friday renewed efforts to quell the 
antiisraeli uprising by doubling to one year the amount of time 
arabs may be jailed without being tried or charged 
defense minister yitzhak rabin ordered the extension and 
justice minister dan meridor approved it 
we are in a war and sometimes residents or citizens rights 
are harmed in the course of a war we have to find the right 
balance so that the damage would not be too serious but on the 
other hand we have to allow the army to fight and win that war 
meridor told israel radio 
the use of administrative detention under which people can be 
jailed without being charged or tried has been denounced by the 
united states and human rights organizations 
israel uses the adminstrative detentions under british emergency 
laws of 1945 which allowed people to be jailed six months without 
charge or trial the procedure has been used frequently during the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip 
israel defends detention without trial as an effective means of 
arresting ringleaders without revealing sources of information but 
attorneys complain they cannot respond to unspecified secret 
charges 
a state department report on human rights released in february 
criticized the procedure and said in many cases that palestinians 
were detained for political reasons or nonviolent activities 
army figures released friday said 9136 palestinians are in 
israeli jails for offenses related to the uprising and that 2111 
of them are being held under administrative detention an army 
spokesman said he did not know if the new order could be applied to 
those already in custody 
also friday activists of the islamic resistance movement known 
as hamas beat to death a west bank resident suspected of violating 
islamic law by dealing drugs and drinking alcohol arab reports 
said 
doctors said the victim samir nazieh kamal 32 died of 
internal bleeding and had been burned on his hands and feet 
he was the 92nd palestinian killed by fellow arabs since the 
uprising began december 1987 
most have been accused of collaborating with israeli 
authorities but shock committees that do the killings also 
have targeted people for drug dealing immoral behavior or criminal 
activities 
since the uprising began 535 palestinians have been killed by 
troops or jewish settlers thirtyeight israelis have died

cia confessed to atone for harm he did egypt not because he was 
tricked or frightened the judge in the case said 
the security court that convicted samy wassef found no 
evidence of physical or moral factors as claimed involved with 
the confession sayeed mahmoud sayed wrote in explaining his 
courts july 20 decision the document was released thursday 
wassef 26 has said interrogators used photographs purporting 
to show torture scenes to persuade him to sign the confession he 
told his mother who is pressing us and egyptian authorities for 
her sons freedom that he was told his bags were packed and an air 
ticket home awaited him if he signed it 
because no witnesses were presented at the 90minute trial 
wassefs 253page confession was the main evidence on which he his 
30yearold brother samir and another american nicholas edward

3850 reynolds was sentenced to five years and a fine of about

country before he was arrested 
prosecutors claimed reynolds was the central intelligence agency 
paymaster for the wassefs they said the brothers were trained in 
spy techniques and sold reynolds information he could not have 
obtained from newspapers 
the court is satisfied with the evidence of guilt and with the 
accuracy of the confession judge sayed wrote on behalf of his 
threeman tribunal the verdict was comfortable and convincing 
his document explaining the verdict said the court was convinced 
samy wassef signed the confession solely because he wanted to 
repent wanted to atone resented what he had committed in regard 
to egypt 
mrs wassefs efforts got another setback after sayed issued his 
explanatory statement she said her sons lawyer hassan ibrashy 
whose name she obtained from a list of lawyers supplied by the us 
embassy withdrew from the case without explanation 
repeated telephone calls to ibrashys home were unanswered 
security agents arrested wassef on nov 14 and he signed the 
confession a few days before his first visit by a us consular 
officer dec 8 he was held eight months before charges were filed 
in early july 
the explanatory document sayed released thursday is the final 
step before the case can be appealed to the court of cassations

at least 16000 workers defied authorities in 
estonia on friday and stayed off the job for a third straight day 
to protest a new election law they consider discriminatory news 
reports said 
the tass news agency said 26 businesses in the republics 
capital of tallinn were affected in the walkout by the nonestonian 
workers strikes also were reported in the mining town of 
kohtlayarve 
tass said walkouts among railway workers were the most 
dangerous because they were impeding the flow of coal shipments 
that pass through tallinns port it said 26000 people were 
striking in tallinn 
the strike began after the estonian parliament on tuesday 
tightened residency requirements for voting and holding elected 
office in the baltic republic 
under the new law residents of estonia must live in the same 
district for at least two years or have lived anywhere in the 
republic for a total of five years to be able to vote 
candidates for elective office must live in the same place for 
five years or in estonia for 10 years 
nonestonian residents of the republic including leaders of the 
russiandominated intermovement group complain the law is aimed 
against them because many are new arrivals they launched a protest 
strike the day after it was passed 
the estonian leadership in a statement published friday 
acknowledged that it failed to take into account fully the 
growth of national consciousness among the nonestonian population 
of the republic tass reported 
estonian government and party leaders blamed themselves for 
arousing mistrust among the population it said they also 
accused strike leaders of trying to stir up ethnic unrest and 
intimidate the nonestonian population tass said 
the estonian parliament issued a ban on strikes thursday but 
strike leaders said they considered the move illegal and had no 
plans to halt the walkouts 
the parliament did not say how strikers would be punished 
mentioning only vague administrative and criminal measures and 
the drafting of a tougher law on strikes 
alexander yakushev a strike committee member said in a 
telephone interview from tallinn that local officials were meeting 
with strikers but that the talks could not be considered 
negotiations 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population and had pushed for the election law to protect 
themselves from an influx of russians and members of other soviet 
ethnic groups

william c lucas rejected by a senate panel 
as the governments civil rights chief was given a different 
justice department job friday that doesnt require confirmation by 
lawmakers 
lucas appointment to head the departments office of liaison 
services enables president bush to end a bitter confrontation with 
senate democrats over the nomination 
some republican senators charging that the detroit republican 
was a victim of politics had urged bush to continue the fight by 
giving lucas an interim appointment to the job he had been rejected 
for assistant attorney general for civil rights 
such a recess appointment while congress is out of town 
this month would have allowed lucas to serve without senate 
confirmation through 1990 but it also would have incurred the 
political wrath of democrats in congress 
before congress adjourned last week senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine warned bush that giving lucas a recess 
appointment would be a very unwise course of action 
white house officials expressing great disappointment in lucas 
rejection by the senate judiciary committee on a pair of 77 votes 
had suggested such an appointment was a possibility 
however one white house official said friday a recess 
appointment was never seriously considered it was just kept out 
there as an option to talk about it would not have given lucas 
much in the way of job security while needlessly poisoning 
relations with congress he said 
the official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said 
bush was not expected to nominate a new candidate for the civil 
rights post until after labor day 
attorney general dick thornburgh had felt strongly about keeping 
lucas at the justice department the official said 
democratic members of the senate judiciary committee and civil 
rights lobbyists who opposed lucas contended that the 61yearold 
former fbi agent sheriff and chief executive of wayne county 
mich was unqualified to run the justice departments civil rights 
division 
lucas who has never tried a court case conceded that i am 
new to the law while being questioned at his confirmation hearing 
in his new job lucas will work directly with civil rights groups 
that opposed his nomination as assistant attorney general 
the ninemember office of liaison services deals with state and 
local governments private organizations businesses and law 
enforcement groups 
a former democrat who became a republican in 1985 lucas will 
serve as gatekeeper for groups that want to meet with thornburgh 
he will be paid the 80700 annual salary he would have earned as 
assistant attorney general 
in a statement announcing the appointment thornburgh said lucas 
will be in charge of coordinating cooperative efforts in law 
enforcement civil rights and the administration of justice 
he will act as my personal representative in dealing with 
persons and organizations in those matters the attorney general 
said 
the office lucas will take over sept 5 was created in 1986 to 
employ an old friend of thenattorney general edwin meese iii whose 
appointment to be an assistant attorney general had been 
successfully opposed by a liberal lobbying group 
barry h stern 42 a longtime thornburgh aide who now heads the 
office will become a special assistant to the attorney general 
stern a key political operative who was pennsylvanias 
secretary of labor and industry when thornburgh was governor will 
work on special projects the department said 
justice department spokesman david runkel said thornburgh has 
begun interviewing candidates for the civil rights position 
looking for someone who has experience in the civil rights area 
some knowledge and affiliation with the civil rights area 
runkel said the criteria were the same that lucas had to meet to 
win thornburghs recommendation for the job 
we felt that bill lucas experience made him fully qualified 
for that position and still believe that runkel said 
since his nomination lucas has been paid 284 a day as a 
consultant to study ways to improve cooperation between the civil 
rights division and state and local police

a new state law regulating the use of 
genetically altered plants and animals strikes a balance between 
protecting the public and letting companies test new technology 
some environmentalists say 
at a news conference thursday in washington a coalition of 
biotechnology companies and environmentalists praised the law as a 
national model and said it will boost north carolinas role in 
biotechnology the search for better hardier plants and animals 
citizens can be informed participants in the 
decisionmaking said rebecca goldburg of the environmental 
defense fund 
but andrew kimbrell a lawyer for a group that opposes field 
testing of genetically engineered organisms denounced the law 
especially the provision that prevents local authorities from 
banning experiments 
theyre playing ecological roulette with communities he 
said because the full impact of new organisms is unknown 
kimbrells group the foundation on economic trends is headed 
by jeremy rifkin a prominent critic of biotechnology 
the law was enacted by the legislature on wednesday as part of 
budget legislation it establishes a 10member state board that 
will review applications by companies to take genetically altered 
plants and animals out of the laboratory and into the field 
the board can require public hearings before granting such 
permits and can decide what information is made public that 
provision is intended to make sure any potential adverse effects of 
a test are not kept secret under the pretense of being confidential 
business information said gerry hancock a durham lawyer and 
former chairman of the quasipublic nc biotechnology center

if tom mix were still here hed know how 
to handle the lowdown varmints who stole his favorite horse 
a statue of tony the wonder horse the late cowboy movie stars 
favorite steed has been stolen from his place of honor at the tom 
mix memorial near here pinal county authorities said thursday 
sheriffs sgt melvin moore said deputies know only that the 
metal statue is gone they dont know when it was stolen who took 
it or why 
the horse was on top of the tom mix monument out there and it 
seemed like someone just pushed it backwards and forwards until it 
broke off moore said it looks like they took it with them 
because we couldnt find it out there 
the mix memorial was built in 1947 at a site along the 
tucsonflorence highway where the silentscreen cowboy died at the 
age of 60 in a 1940 traffic accident 
the monument which included a bronze plaque was topped by an 
iron statue of a horse with its head lowered and its saddle empty 
that original statue donated by the florence chamber of 
commerce was stolen in the spring of 1980 it was never found 
the county historical society replaced the statue five years ago 
with help from inmates at the arizona state prison in florence 
society spokeswoman billy earley said 
and now the new statue has been the private research group the game 
conservancy 
during the season which lasts until december people who 
usually stage 10 days of shootings will probably hold two or 
three he said 
a large amount of shooting is being canceled agreed charles 
orssich of roxton sporting agency ltd which organizes shoots on 
the grouse moors most of which are privately owned 
but he said demand was still high from english american 
french german all sorts of people from all walks of life who 
can afford the 1100 to 1600 a day it costs to shoot 
traditionally the glorious twelfth was highlighted by a race to 
whisk the first game from the moors and serve it piping hot on the 
table 
people would try to serve it for breakfast theyd be out on 
the moors in formula one racing cars said pamela crawford 
spokeswoman for the prestigious gleneagles hotel in eastern 
scotland a former grouseserving contender 
but a combination of ecological awareness and hunt protesters 
who make predawn attacks to drive off the birds has toned down the 
presentation 
we used to celebrate the glorious twelfth but for the fifth 
year running were giving the money we normally spend on the race 
to the scottish grouse research project appeal said ms 
crawford the only guns at the hotel tomorrow will be fired at 
clay pigeons 
still people will be able to eat a traditional twelfth meal at 
the 65yearold hotel im sure grouse will be on the menu she 
said

the state department on friday took the 
unusual step of singling out syria for its role in the latest 
outburst of fighting in beirut 
the criticism came as us officials continued to seek syrian 
help in obtaining the release of eight american hostages held by 
proiranian militants in lebanon 
the united states condemns the indiscriminate slaughter of 
innocent people and the renewed use of heavy caliber weapons such 
as the 240millimeter mortar which are in the syrian arsenal 
said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
we again call upon syria an active participant in the 
fighting the lebanese armed forces as well as the various 
lebanese factions for an immediate ceasefire the lifting of all 
blockades and the initiation of a dialogue for the political 
reconstruction of lebanon she added 
the state department has in the past generally refrained from 
singling out the combatants by name preferring to call for 
restraint by all sides 
the latest round of fighting in the fivemonth artillery war 
over control of beirut came on friday when syrian and christian 
gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers killing six 
people the fighting followed 15 hours of fierce fighting thursday 
that escalated sharply when syrian gunners targeted the 
presidential palace with 240mm mortars 
the escalation and the shellings and the dramatic increase in 
casualties give urgent impetus to our call for the arab league to 
overcome the obstructions facing it and resume its efforts on 
behalf of the people of lebanon tutwiler said 
several weeks of mediation efforts by leaders of the 21nation 
arab league have failed to bring about a lasting ceasefire 
tutwiler said the united states through its embassy in 
damascus approached the syrian government about the hostages the 
approach came after a group of kidnappers claimed last week to have 
hanged marine lt col william higgins and the state department 
sought to determine his fate 
we have continued our contacts to try to assure that syria 
will do everything possible to assist in a successful resolution to 
the hostage crisis she said 
us policy toward syria treads a delicate balance of criticism 
of the sovietbacked government for its support of palestinian and 
shiite terrorism and seeking to enlist its support for the 
arabisraeli peace process and other negotiations in the volatile 
region

president bush would not rule out seizing 
gen manuel antonio noriega panamas de facto ruler to face 
charges in miami in a federal drug trafficking case white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday 
the spokesman however did not say the president was 
contemplating such a move and said there was no correlation 
between bushs comments to that effect in an interview and the 
recent military maneuvers by us forces in panama 
the stepped up military maneuvers are intended to make an 
impression in that volatile country and ensure that our degree of 
interest and control there is recognized and protected fitzwater 
told reporters 
reporters asked for clarification on the difference between 
seizing noriega who is accused of drug trafficking by the united 
states and terrorists kidnapping americans they believed guilty of 
crimes 
elaborating on bushs comments in an interview this week with 
hearst newspapers washington bureau fitzwater said 
the president was pointing out the difference between 
kidnapping and capturing someone who has been indicted charged and 
ordered to be extradited to the united states for legal violations 
and he said he would not rule out that option in the case of mr 
noriega 
bush asked how he viewed the noriega situation in light of his 
position that he would not abduct anyone to set up a hostage trade 
said in the interview that theres a differentiating precedent 
between taking somebody hostage and apprehending somebody to bring 
them to trial 
i took an oath to uphold the law it doesnt include 
necessarily telling me how i have to go about apprehending people 
but i wouldnt rule out an option or discuss what i might or might 
not do in terms of noriega 
but i view that very differently than if you took somebody and 
then wanted to trade him off bush said 
the united states has tried unsuccessfully to pressure noriega 
from power and currently supports the ongoing diplomatic efforts 
of the organization of american states to arrange a peaceful 
transfer of power by sept 1 
the oas called for subsequent democratic elections to select a 
new president although the organization did not specifically call 
for noriega to step down as the united states has urged 
bush beefed up us trooppresence in panama as part of a show of 
opposition to the noriega regime after the strongman refused to 
acknowledge results of the may election that was widely said by 
observers to have been won by the opposition forces 
a weeklong series of confrontations between noriegas defense 
forces and us southern command troops included arrests on both 
sides and the blocking of nearby fort amador by american soldiers 
us troops have been conducting exercises to defend the panama 
canal under the 1977 treaties and panamanian troops in some 
instances have been shadowing them 
noriega on thursday said he will not yield to demands that he 
quit as chief of the defense forces from what he called those 
barbarians from the north their lackeys and tame politicians 
fitzwater said the us exercises would continue 
we have always said that we would feel free to carry out 
exercises in support of our rights under the panama canal treaty 
and in the current situation there frankly the purpose of 
that is just to make sure that we do have that access to make sure 
our degree of interest and control there is recognized and 
protected

cardinal albert decourtray roman catholic 
archbishop of lyon said friday the agreement with jewish groups 
calling for moving a carmelite convent away from the site of the 
auschwitz death camp should be respected 
an accord binds those who signed it said decourtray who 
was involved in negotiating the agreement between jewish and 
catholic leaders signed in geneva in february 1987 
jews have argued it is offensive to locate the convent and erect 
religious symbols at the auschwitzbirkenau complex an estimated 
25 million jews were murdered at the camp in naziheld poland 
the archbishop of krakow cardinal franciszek macharski said 
thursday the agreement with jewish leaders had been suspended and 
blamed recent protests by jewish groups at the convent for creating 
an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
decourtray said in his statement friday that demonstrations 
and regrettable reactions cannot be taken into account against the 
cause which the accord of feb 22 1987 was intended to defend 
he said the french roman catholic bishops would do everything 
we can so that the dialogue inaugurated under the sign of the 
geneva accord can continue we need mutual respect so as not to 
damage the memory of auscwhitz 
a statement in paris by members of the jewish delegation to the 
geneva talks noted with satisfaction and respect the terms of the 
declaration cardinal decourtray has just issued 
it said the delegation fully associates itself with cardinal 
decourtrays appeal for mutual respect in the memory of auschwitz 
and of all jewish and nonjewish victims of auschwitz

will manufacture medical diagnostic equipment in kiev tass 
announced 
relations between israel and the soviet union have been growing 
warmer in recent months but full diplomatic ties have not been 
restored the soviet union broke off relations with israel in 1967 
tass quoted andrei serdyuk deputy health minister in the 
ukraine as saying the joint venture was formed by his ministry 
the israeli corporation elscint and a kiev weapons manufacturing 
plant starting to make goods for the consumer sector 
the enterprise will assemble foreignmanufactured parts into 
ultrasonic equipment which is used to diagnose problems with 
internal organs and check the health of fetuses the official news 
agency said its products will go both for export and for domestic 
use

defining their status has not yet been worked out a top economic 
official said

independent budgets products and services will move freely between 
the zones and the foreign market without customs or other

effect but said the decision has already been taken 
in china special economic zones are a key part of current 
experiments with western economic ideas shenzen near hong kong 
is packed with foreign firms factories employing lowpaid chinese

the red building tucked away in the scenic 
mountains of northwest virginia looks more like a schoolhouse than 
the nations first prefabricated jail made from converted shipping 
containers 
new picnic tables in the back overlook a lush green field 
theres plenty of room outside the building for exercise or 
picnics but the building is being noticed for more than its looks 
i think what these people are doing for prison construction is 
equivalent to what henry ford did for automobile construction 
said richard abell assistant us attorney general for justice 
programs henry ford did not invent the automobile but he made 
it accessible what these people are doing is making prisons 
accessible 
abell said the loudoun county facility is the first of its kind 
in the country he said what makes this jail different is no one 
has ever taken these shipping containers already made and made 
them into jails 
surfside 6 industries of mclean built the sixcell 23cot jail 
in 13 working days for 96398 that translates into a cost of 
about 4000 a bed 
ordinarily it costs 40000 to 100000 per bed space and it 
generally takes two years to build a jail or a prison abell 
said these guys put it together in two weeks thats beyond 
revolutionary 
abell said another advantage is the flexibility of the prefab 
jails 
like tinkertoys they can be rearranged if they need to be 
changed in five or 10 years abell said if the needs have 
decreased theyre not stuck with it on the landscape you dont 
have a problem like san francisco has with alcatraz a big massive 
sore on the landscape 
jim wordsworth secretary and treasurer of surfside 6 said the 
prefab building could be used as a shelter for the homeless or to 
store records 
each steel shipping container is 8 feet tall 8 feet wide and 20 
feet long wordsworth said to convert it into a jail cell the 
container is insulated and a wall covering such as cement or 
drywall is put on the finished building uses traditional plumbing 
wiring and heating 
wordsworth said the used containers are transported to surfside 
6 industries factory in fort lauderdale fla and put together 
there then shipped to the location he said they can be built on 
site too 
abell a member of the national institute of corrections 
advisory board said prison crowding has become a national problem 
between 1963 and 1981 our crime rate soared 337 percent in 
the united states and prison construction in the same period went 
up 27 percent abell said 
loudoun county sheriff john isom said there is a shortage of 
about 3000 beds in the washington dc area and of about 1900 
beds in northern virginia 
he said the maximumsecurity prison in leesburg has 63 beds and 
averages 100 people a day he said he plans to move at least 23 
people who are in workrelease programs to the prefab jail when it 
opens this month 
but isom said overcrowding will continue unless someone 
figures out a way to eradicate the drug problem 
crowding causes many problems he said including violence 
we have inmate fights a couple of times a week isom said 
while counties elsewhere have agonized over finding sites and 
money to build large futureoriented buildings equipped with 
computercontrolled security and even robot food carts isom said 
he was looking for a quick and inexpensive solution 
he and wordsworth said the jails security will be adequate 
wordsworth said a special welding torch would be required to cut 
through the walls made of insulcrete a patented concrete with 
high insulation quality 
he said officials from all over the country are calling about 
the jail 
its unbelievable he said theyre bringing the county 
administrator the director of finance the sheriff to look at this 
its unique its portable you can set it down and then move 
the whole structure he said there is so much citizen unrest 
on the location of prisons and jails they can assure the 
citizens theyre temporarily solving a problem until they go 
through all of the rituals of building 
greg bogdan spokesman for the federal bureau of prisons said 
the bureau isnt opposed to the prefab idea but says it isnt the 
longterm solution to the crowding problem 
theyre suitable for emergency situations but theyre not an 
answer to the longterm prison problem as far as the bureau is 
concerned bogdan said there is still a need for permanent 
facilities

a presidential task force indicated friday 
that improved environmental safeguards are essential if oil 
exploration is to be allowed in three controversial ocean sites off 
the california and florida coasts 
but the task force gave no indication in a progress report on 
what it will recommend to the president at the end of the year and 
said it also has made no judgment on the validity of conflicting 
claims about environmental and economic effects of drilling in 
the three areas 
the panel which is charged with recommending to president bush 
whether to open up the three sites for oil drilling outlined a 
broad array of options it is considering from urging a goahead for 
drilling to barring oil companies from the areas altogether 
the task force document acknowleged that during nine public 
hearings a vast majority of the testimony revolved around 
concerns that oil drilling on the sites would cause harm to 
environmentally sensitive areas nearby 
many people expressed the view that while they would suffer 
the losses from any environmental effects of oil and gas 
development they stand to gain few if any of the potential 
benefits said the task force at the same time the group noted 
oil and gas industry spokesmen disputed the environmental concerns 
and suggested the risks are minimal 
environmentalists have long opposed oil drilling in the three 
areas a 11 million acres section of ocean off southern 
california another 67 million acres off the northern california 
and 14 million acres in the gulf of mexico near the florida 
everglades 
in each case critics have questioned the need to open the areas 
for oil development and maintained that drilling threatens nearby 
national parks various endangered species and delicate sealife 
the concern intensified after the massive oil spill from the exxon 
valdez tanker last march in alaska 
the task force said it had heard from more than 650 witnesses 
during the nine hearings and received some 11000 pieces of written 
testimony but said it was opening the matter for additional 
written comments from interested parties before proceeding 
while the task force said it was not prepared to agree or 
disagree with the claim of environmentalists it said that before a 
decision is made on whether the three areas should be opened to the 
oil companies additional restrictions designed to reduce the 
environmental impacts of oil and gas development will be needed 
it noted a long list of options aimed at improving environmental 
safeguards but said no decision had been made on which ones to 
recommend to the president 
among the options under consideration are the widespread use of 
buffer zones between drilling sites and areas that are 
environmentally sensitive and an array of proposals to protect 
against oil spills or mitigate damages if a spill should occur 
the panel said it is considering suggestions that oil from 
offshore drilling sites in the three areas to be transported to 
shore by pipeline and not tanker that oil companies as part of 
their lease agreement hold a special bond to assure adequate 
compensation for spill damage that permanent emergency response 
teams be established with adequate equipment manpower and training 
and that tankers if allowed be limited in size and have double 
bottoms

a sculptor and a poet who spent their 
boyhoods working the family farm have planted a field of corn in 
the middle of the city and scattered furniture within the rows 
all in the name of art 
in two weeks theyll have a poetry reading a harvest and then 
roast an ear of art 
now thats art with good taste or at least art that tastes good 
sculptor caleb brennan and parttime poet dale hasenick hope to 
raise along with an edible crop awareness about the importance 
of corn in american life 
im hoping that people might have an awareness of how corn is 
in our lives all over everything from corn oil to plastics 
said hasenick whose poetry inspired brennans sculpture in the 
front yard of the urban institute for contemporary arts 
inside the 30by30foot patch of maize are a stove kitchen 
table stuffed chair and toilet all culled from the salvation army 
and a dump an oldfashioned bedstead surrounds a coverlet of 
marble chips upon which sleeps a little white pine tree elfsize 
chairs and a sewing machine were added by an artist in residence at 
the institute 
the pair reason that if corn starch compounds can be used to 
make such items as biodegradable garbage bags and disposable 
diapers surely its stalks can be used for art 
some neighbors arent pleased with the urban field of dreams and 
question how anyone could consider it artwork 
but mary barwacz who grows corn in her garden down the block 
from the institute gets a kick out of the piece 
its comical see said with a chuckle darn nice corn 
too 
brennan and hasenick both worked on family farms near jackson in 
their youth and met at spring arbor college 
brennan who sets up exhibits at the grand rapids art museum 
got the idea for the maize house when he read part of a poem in 
progress by hasenick in which a man makes himself a house amid a 
cornfield 
the character sets up his living space and a religious shrine 
in the middle of a cornfield said hasenick who works as a 
magazine typesetter in chicago 
he sees three levels of interpretation of the exhibit corn as a 
commercial product corn as an object of sustenance and spiritual 
reverence for north and latin american natives and corn as a 
cornerstone of midwestern traditions and culture 
but in the last analysis brennan and hasenick hope the public 
will appreciate the sculpture at face value people are invited to 
walk through the stalks 
i think it should be enjoyed as kind of a fun idea brennan 
said just come at it with what you know about corn and houses

scorecard killer randy kraft should 
die in the gas chamber for his twodecade spree of sexual violence 
and mutilation that left at least 16 young men and boys dead a 
jury decided friday 
the jury had convicted kraft of 16 murders on may 12 they began 
deliberations wednesday on the penalty 
orange county superior court judge donald mccartin will sentence 
kraft on oct 27 he can reduce the punishment to life imprisonment 
a death sentence will automatically be appealed 
this is our day for justice it will not bring back our son 
but at least we know he kraft will not be back out on the 
streets said shirley devaul the mother of one of krafts 
victims rodger james devaul 20 
devauls body was found sodomized with his throat cut dumped 
near the a ski resort on feb 13 1983 
as the jury filed into court kraft leaned back almost casually 
in his chair then he leaned forward peering intently as each 
juror was polled and each confirmed the death sentence 
the verdict followed months of grisly testimony about the 
deaths which took place from 1972 to 1983 kraft a 44yearold 
computer consultant picked up hitchhikers disabled them by plying 
them with drugs and alcohol sexually tortured and mutilated them 
and then strangled them prosecutors said 
it gives me the shivers to talk about it deputy district 
attorney bryan brown said at one point 
defense attorneys c thomas mcdonald and james merwin never 
called kraft to the witness stand they argued that evidence 
against him was inconclusive 
the 16 murder convictions are an orange county record and one of 
the nations biggest killing sprees but prosecutors contend they 
are fewer than half of krafts bloody legacy he has been linked to 
at least 21 other slayings in california oregon and michigan 
kraft had a fetish for collecting mementos of victims and 
photographs brown said during the trial describing photos in 
which victims apparently were posed while dead 
a socalled death list in krafts car which prosecutors say 
contains coded references to his victims led kraft to be dubbed 
the scorecard killer 
kraft was arrested may 14 1983 when highway patrol officers 
pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled 
marine from el toro in the car

most of perus 30000 bank employees walked 
off the job friday to demand higher wages and miners and 
construction workers threatened strikes to demand pay increases to 
help them survive the nations worst economic crisis 
inflation in the last 12 months has topped 5000 percent and 
the economy shrank last year by nearly 9 percent hundreds of 
thousands of people are out of work 
the bank strike forced the nations stock market to close 
friday police escorted customers through picket lines and 
midlevel managers handled some transactions 
radio reports said police used tear gas to break up a 
demonstration outside the banco internacional in downtown lima 
there were no reports of injuries 
the communistled federation of bank employees whose members 
make from 250 to 310 a month are asking for increases of about 
400 a month the banks have offered 90 
the countrys minimum wage is 45 a month 
the national mine workers federation has called a general strike 
monday to demand salary increases and joint negotiations with mine 
owners miners struck for three months last year over the same 
issue resulting in 400 million in lost export earnings for the 
country 
the countrys 80000 miners make from 2 to 12 a day depending 
on the company they are seeking at least 500 a month 
the civil construction workers union said it would strike aug 
16 to protest the grave crisis of hunger and misery experienced 
by the workers and the public according to the secretary general 
of the union pedro huilca 
friday also marked the 73rd day of a wage strike by public 
doctors which has left government hospitals and emergency clinics 
unattended the 8000 doctors average about 100 a month and are 
seeking to be paid about 290 a month the government has offered 
250 
all the strikes have been declared illegal by the government 
peru is suffering its most serious economic crisis in its 
168year history as an independent nation 
many accuse president alan garcia of bankrupting the country and 
sparking hyperinflation with his freespending populist economic 
policies 
the government blames much of the crisis on the battle with two 
rebel groups the maoinspired shining path which took up arms in 
1980 and the procuban tupac amaru revolutionary movement which 
has been fighting since 1984 
the groups have attacked power lines across the country 
electric power has been rationed in lima and other cities as a 
result of the attacks which the government says has caused more 
than 10 billion in damage 
the government declared the mining province of huarochiri 30 
miles east of lima under emergency restrictions thursday the move 
gave the military control of the important central highway which 
connects most of the countrys highland mining centers with the 
capital 
jorge quesada general secretary of the miners union said the 
move would not affect plans for the strike monday 
mining exports brought in more than 12 billion in 1988 
representing more than half the foreign exchange earnings of this 
debtor nation

the drownings of four children killed when their familys car 
crashed through a barrier and into the detroit river police said 
friday 
police said they had sought a murde warrant against the suspect 
whose name they refused to release pending arraignment later in the 
day 
relatives said lawrence delisle the father of the children was 
taken into custody thursday after he and his wife submitted to 
polygraph tests 
the premeditation goes back some time and the opportunity 
presented itself police chief edward rothermal said at a news 
conference friday 
though they would not identify the suspect police did say they 
were not seeking charges against delisles wife suzanne who also 
survived the lincoln park familys crash aug 3 
the facts of the investigation reveal she had nothing to do 
with this rothermal said

was a suicide attempt 
yesterday afternoon things started working out for us

indicating the involvement of a suspect and what actually 
happened at the river 
delisle 28 was driving when his car ran into the river in this

a homeowners association that allows 
basketball backboards treehouses and swing sets has no right to 
ban skateboard ramps an appeals court ruled 
the hanover woods homeowners association pointing to its rules 
prohibiting obnoxious or offensive activity sued roy lathan 
and his family last year after he built a skateboard ramp to reward 
his sons roy jr now 17 and jason now 13 for making their 
schools honor rolls 
circuit judge s joseph davis jr told the lathans to tear down 
the 10foot ramp and the lake mary family complied but lathan 
appealed believing we were being discriminated against 
on thursday the 5th district court of appeal agreed 
in height the ramp does not exceed a basketball backboard 
and it is closer to the ground than a treehouse chief judge 
winifred sharp wrote a large swing set is wider a playhouse or 
treehouse is more complex in structure 
lathan said thursday he had spent more than 10000 on legal 
costs during the past two years and he hopes to recover those 
costs from the homeowners association 
ill get it all back he said if i think im right ill

the no 2 official at the deparment of housing 
and urban development said friday he will ask clevelandarea 
officials to shake up the management of their housing authority but 
opposes a federal takeover of the longtroubled agency sought by 
the mayor of the city 
the problem is basically a management problem and i think 
clearly the management in place is not up to the challenge at 
hand hud undersecretary al dellibovi said of the cuyahoga 
metropolitan housing authority the solution to this kind of 
local problem is not a federal takeover 
dellibovi is traveling to cleveland on monday to meet with mayor 
george voinovich the mayor of neighboring east cleveland and 
members of the cleveland city council all of whom share 
appointment power to the authority board voinovich repeatedly has 
asked the federal agency to take over the housing authority 
delibovi who requested the meeting said he wanted to reserve 
judgment on the performance of the fiveman board that oversees the 
authority but said clearly the major problem is the daytoday 
management 
we are not really equipped to operate that kind of agency and 
deliver public housing services but we can take supervisory action 
to bring the services to to level that tenants deserve 
he declined to discuss steps hud was contemplating if it did not 
receive a satisfactory response from local officials 
hud pays more than half of the agencys operating budget in 
september 1985 hud labeled the cleveland authority operationaly 
troubled because of its high vacancy rates and poor condition of 
its units which house more than 19000 people on 38 sites 
a 1987 audit found the authority on occassion paid maintenance 
workers double or triple their salaries in overtime without 
required proof that the work was performed in both 1982 and 1986 
huds inspector general issued audits critical of the authoritys 
maintenance program 
an earlier internal hud review determined that errors by the 
housing agencys staff resulted in inflated rent subsidies to 
developers participating in an housing rehabilitation program

the publisher of nashvilles morning 
newspaper has asked a federal court to block an attempt by united 
press international to make him identify the source of disparaging 
comments about a former upi president 
the comments from the source were printed in a september 1984 
story in the tennessean about the firing of william j small as 
head of the wire service 
small later sued upi seeking 10 million and alleging breach of 
contract he also claimed upi and several of its executives libeled 
him in explaining the reasons for his departure 
publisher john l seigenthaler said in court papers filed 
thursday that tennessees shield law allowed the newspaper to 
withhold the name of the source 
the 1984 story quoted the source as saying small had failed to 
perform in a manner expected of the chief operating officer he did 
not live up to expectations 
small was hired as president of upi in september 1982 his

a handwringing tiefiddling nervously sweating 
criminal defendant actually appears more deceitful to jurors when 
the evidence against him is weak than when it is somewhat stronger 
a psychological study indicates 
researchers who performed the study published in saturdays 
journal of applied psychology say it supports what every country 
lawyer knows if the evidence indicates innocence to a jury dont 
let a fidgety defendant have a chance to put a noose around his own 
neck 
when the evidence is strong they jurors could decide it 
more on the evidence said david r shaffer a university of 
georgia psychology professor who led the study the same is true 
if the case is close 
but shaffer said anxiouslooking defendants appear more 
deceptive to jurors if the evidence is weak 
i think the jurors are saying the evidence isnt all that 
strong but this guy is nervous and he looks guilty they 
reinterpret the evidence shaffer said 
he said the study appears to contradict research indicating that 
demeanor comes into play only when the evidence is ambiguous 
shaffer and two colleagues from georgia college sarah h hendry 
and dina peacock used 120 undergraduate students as mock jurors to 
hear a case of academic fraud on an exam an actor from the 
universitys drama department played the defendant whose pseudonym 
was cliff roberts 
three trials were held before three juries in the first the 
evidence was strong eyewitnesses saw roberts using a cheat sheet 
on the exam his answers were identical to another students and a 
student testified roberts had been caught cheating off her paper in 
a previous class 
the second case was weaker with the eyewitness accounts more 
ambiguous and the allegation of past cheating implied rather than 
confirmed 
in the third case roberts was portrayed as an excellent student 
with no need to cheat his professor testified that roberts had 
worked hard to perform well on the exam and there was no allegation 
of past cheating 
the jurors then watched a threeminute videotape during which 
roberts made identical points about his innocence he had no cheat 
sheet or advance knowledge of the exam and had never been accused 
of academic fraud previously 
the only difference in the testimony was the actors portrayal 
of roberts demeanor half the jurors saw a calm confident 
witness while the others saw one who stammered fiddled with his 
tie hesitated and generally looked anxious 
jurors were then asked to vote for conviction or acquittal 
taking both the evidence and the defendants demeanor into account 
the study found demeanor had the most effect when the evidence 
favored the accused with 85 percent of those who considered the 
weakest evidence and saw the nervous witness voting for conviction 
only 15 percent indicated guilt when the defendant was calm and the 
evidence was weak 
in the strongevidence case 100 percent of jurors voted for 
conviction when the witness was nervous and 90 percent when he was 
calm when the evidence was balanced 70 percent favored conviction 
when the defendant was nervous and 60 percent when he was 
controlled 
a nervous defendant therefore stood a better chance of 
acquittal when the evidence against him was balanced than when it 
was weak 
we think that the hesitancy and uncertainty of the apparently 
deceptive defendant must have appeared especially suspicious in the 
face of objectively weak evidence against him shaffer wrote 
richard hendrix an atlanta criminal defense attorney who 
represented former rep pat swindall in his recent perjury trial 
said the study bears out his experience in handling fidgety 
defendants 
if there is a strong case against the defendant he might be 
able to convince the jury to let him walk if its teetering either 
way and you have a guy whos articulate and you think he might 
carry the day you might put him up hendrix said 
its best not to call a defendant when in doubt he may come 
off bad even if hes innocent he said 
hendrix did not put swindall on the stand and the congressman 
was convicted hendrix has not said why swindall did not testify

the justice department on friday said flatly 
that public disclosure of its investigation of suspected soviet spy 
felix s bloch has compromised the governments ability to obtain 
evidence against him 
there is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case 
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation 
did compromise the investigation david runkel chief department 
spokesman told reporters 
runkel refused to specify how the leak hampered investigators 
but his comments hardened the governments assessment of the damage 
done 
the case was publicly disclosed july 21 runkels statement 
friday contrasted with his more cautious july 31 assessment that 
premature disclosure may have had an adverse impact on the 
development of new evidence 
on friday runkel said the difference in the statements 
reflects a different view based on how people in the department 
see the situation today 
no charges have been brought against bloch once the no 2 us 
diplomat in vienna who is suspected of having spied for the soviet 
union since 1974 he has been suspended with pay 
runkel acknowledged that the justice department opposed 
confirmation by the state department on july 21 of an abc news 
report that bloch was under investigation 
since then bloch has been followed in what runkel described 
as the circus going on out there by a horde of reporters and 
fbi agents who are conducting an open surveillance while 
investigators try to gather evidence to bring charges 
the chief obstacle according to government sources is that 
investigators cannot identify a specific secret that bloch may have 
compromised the sources say bloch was videotaped giving a 
briefcase to a soviet agent in paris on may 14 but investigators 
dont know what was in it 
on thursday runkel acknowledged the department did not have a 
case to bring against bloch 
the department does not bring charges unless it believes it 
has sufficient evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable 
doubt that a person is guilty of violating the law runkel said 
he refused to comment when asked if the justice department was 
negotiating a deal with bloch under which the 54yearold diplomat 
would receive immunity from prosecution in return for detailing 
information allegedly given to the soviets 
runkel also has refused to discuss whether the department has 
evidence of espionage that it is unwilling to use in court because 
disclosure would impair counterintelligence operations 
bloch meanwhile continued on friday to lead print and 
television photographers on daily excursions from his apartment in 
the capitals posh kalorama neighborhood 
in the afternoon bloch stuck his head out a window and 
announced to photographers that he was about to leave 
two hours later bloch finally left in his lightblue 
mercedesbenz after inviting a tv crew to join him for a ride 
while he did errands 
bloch followed by a 20car caravan of reporters photographers 
and fbi agents drove to a supermarket in suburban bethesda md 
bloch also visited a nearby book store 
in the supermarket a tv cameraman knocked over an elderly woman 
shopper while backpeddling to get a shot of bloch 
the woman cut her hand when she fell to the floor and tv crews 
left the store after the manager asked them to leave

a ranking communist party official said 
the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 was essentially 
wrong and should be reexamined the party newspaper reported 
friday 
the strongest criticism yet by a soviet bloc party official came 
10 days before the 21st anniversary of the invasion which crushed 
the liberal prague spring led by alexander dubcek then 
czechoslovak party chief 
imre szokai also said that if communist candidates lost in 
multiparty elections next year no allied country would interfere 
militarily as in the past when party rule seemed threatened 
szokai is deputy chief of international party relations 
in poland the solidaritydominated senate unanimously passed a 
resolution condemning the invasion as a violation of the 
indispensable right of every nation for selfdetermination and the 
natural striving for democracy freedom and respect of human 
rights 
the freely elected senate was created as part of polands 
democratic reforms ninetynine of its 100 members were elected on 
the opposition solidarity trade union ticket 
szokai told the party daily nepszabadsag in a frontpage 
article it is obvious today that the decision to move the 
military in czechoslovakia in 1968 was essentially wrong 
hungarys participation in the warsaw pact invasion has become 
an issue since the country embarked on farreaching political and 
economic reforms 
in contrast to poland where reforms were forced by solidarity 
reformers within the party are behind hungarys liberalization 
some have expessed willingness to step aside if the party loses the 
first multiparty elections since the communists consolidated power 
in 1948 
hungarian television interviewed dubcek and czechoslovak 
dissident vaclav havel straining relations between hungary and the 
conservative czechoslovak party 
szokai said the hungarian leadership responded to an open letter 
dubcek sent to the leaders of the warsaw pact countries involved in 
the invasion urging them to renounce the intervention 
he gave no details of the response sent to dubcek a disgraced 
figure in his homeland 
in the newspaper interview szokai said the task of assessing 
the internal political events in czechoslovakia at the time falls 
naturally in the scope of the czechoslovak people and their 
communist party 
hungary does not want to interfere he said but it is not 
necessary to conceal our opinion either 
since some socialist countries have already started to explore 
and reassess our common past it would be only reasonable if the 
countries involved examined their decision together he said 
leaders of solidarity who visited czechoslovakia last month 
where they met with dubcek and activists said later that reformers 
in poland hungary and the soviet union should condemn the invasion 
szokai said until a common analysis is possible the 
individual states should draw the necessary conclusions on their 
own 
he said the hungarian party had learned the most important 
lessons of 1968 and rejected the brezhnev doctrine used to 
justify intervention in a sovietbloc country if the communist 
leadership seemed threatened 
last month in romania leaders of the seven warsaw pact nations 
agreed on the sovereignty of each and the principle of 
noninterference in internal affairs 
asked by the newspaper whether soviet bloc allies would come 
to our assistance if the party lost next years elections szokai 
said most certainly not

shells exploded in the streets friday and 
smoke billowed from the wooded slopes southeast of beirut as syrian 
and christian gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers 
the shelling which lasted more than 13 hours killed 10 people 
and wounded 40 
authorities said the barrage shattered a ninehour overnight 
lull that followed 15 hours of fierce fighting 
a spokesman for the christian army commander gen michel aoun 
said the syrians started the shooting friday by targeting aouns 
residence at the presidential palace in suburban baabda no 
casualties were reported at the palace 
aoun has lived in the bunker three stories under the palace 
since the confrontation began march 8 between his christian units 
and syrian troops 
by police count 586 people have been killed and 1514 wounded 
in washington the state department singled out syria for 
criticism a departure from its usual policy of calling for 
restraint by all sides 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united states condemns 
the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people and the renewed use 
of heavy caliber weapons such as the 240mm mortar which are in 
the syrian arsenal 
we again call upon syria an active participant in the 
fighting the lebanese armed forces as well as the various 
lebanese factions for an immediate ceasefire 
the aoun spokesman who refused to be identified said the 
syrian barrage also targeted beiruts eastern suburbs of hadath and 
baabda and the metin region north of the city 
shelling escalated sharply thursday when syrian gunners 
concentrated on the presidential palace hammering it with 240mm 
mortars 
stunned civilians stumbled from underground shelters during the 
morning lull to check their homes and businesses 
innocent civilians left the dark shelters only to be faced by 
the bitter truth this devastating war has eaten up their 
properties moslemrun voice of the nation radio said 
is this meaningless war going to continue until the last 
lebanese is dead the announcer asked his voice choking with 
emotion 
shell explosions accompanied by the whooshing sound of rockets 
and the wailing of sirens echoed across beirut and the surrounding 
mountains overnight as fires blazing out of control illuminated 
the sky 
security sources said more than 10000 shells and rockets rained 
down overnight 
one noted that the killing ground was expanded during the 
duel with aouns gunners targeting syrian army positions as far as 
baalbek 40 miles northeast of beirut 
a resident of baalbek who drove to beirut friday said a dozen 
shells crashed into the city and the surrounding villages overnight 
obviously there were casualties the shells targeted syrian 
army positions she said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the syrian command in lebanon refuses to comment on its losses 
supply lines to syrian forces in moslem west beirut and the 
druseheld mountains southeast of the city go through the bekaa 
valley the syrian response to aouns shelling of the valley was 
ferocious according to a police spokesman 
at times he said the syrians operated in harmony several 
sovietdesigned multibarrelled rocket launchers against the 
christian enclave spitting out hundreds of rockets in less than a 
minute 
it was carpet rocketing with salvoes of rockets crashing into 
a small area and transforming it into rubble the police 
spokesman said 
the duels have forced all but about 200000 of the citys 15 
million people to flee 
the violence broke out after aoun blockaded ports run by syrias 
militia allies south of beirut the syrians and allied forces 
retaliated by shelling the christian enclave 
syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate aoun charges syria has betrayed that mandate 
by siding with the moslems in the countrys 14yearold civil war

the nations oldest rape crisis center 
faces funding cuts that would devastate its ability to serve 
hundreds of victims of rape and sexual assault directors said 
friday 
bay area women against rape which was founded in 1971 and has 
served as a model for rape crisis centers nationwide may lose 
onethird of its funding for direct client services if county 
leaders approve cuts recommended by the probation department said 
center director marcia blackstock 
the cuts are part of a countywide budget crunch that may force 
the center to lay off two of the four staff counselors who help 
rape and assault victims in alameda county blackstock said 
it means when a call comes in were going to have to say no 
and i dont know on a personal level how were going to do that 
said diane santellan crisis intervention coordinator 
most of the centers other funds are linked to the number of 
clients served so the cutback also would trigger subsequent cuts 
directors said 
the center served nearly 8200 new rape and assault victims last 
year blackstock said services include rape crisis counseling a 
24hour telephone hotline staffed by volunteers hospital and court 
visits counseling and community rape prevention programs 
with 538 rapes reported in 1987 the city of oakland leads the 
state and is fourth in the nation in the number of reported rapes 
per year blackstock said in addition nearly 700 other sexual 
assaults were reported to oakland police 
but for every reported rape about 10 more go unreported 
according to fbi figures she said adding that at least 7000 
rapes occur in alameda county annually 
the cuts would also force the center to eliminate its 
sensitivity training programs for police therapists and hospital 
personnel she said 
we wont close our doors but well have to drastically cut 
back the number of people we serve blackstock said estimating 
that 2700 clients would be eliminated 
mary king vicechairwoman of the county board of supervisors 
said the proposed center cutback is part of a 3 percent 
acrosstheboard county budget cut ordered by the chief 
administrative officer 
everybody who has come to see me or called has had a very 
legitimate and vital service thats needed in alameda county 
king said listing family planning services and disabled support 
services as among those facing cuts 
were just doing the best we can in a very difficult 
situation she said its very depressing 
faced with a directive to slash 11 million in services the 
county probation department recommended cutting all nonmandated 
programs including the 70405 promised to the crisis center for 
fiscal year 198990 
the supervisors are scheduled to consider the centers budget 
next tuesday and make a preliminary decision two days later 
other center funding includes a 61000 grant from the state 
office of criminal justice planning and 23800 from the city of 
fremont to operate a second office in that city but those funds 
could dwindle if the crisis center cant serve the promised number 
of clients blackstock said 
blackstock finds it difficult to think of the effects of the 
proposed funding cut 
we live with them day and night she said theyre not 
just numbers we see the trauma they come to us with and we see the 
difference support understanding and knowledge can make in these 
peoples lives

the agriculture department said friday it 
expects a sharp increase in world wheat production this year but 
for the third consecutive season it wont meet demand 
world wheat production in 198990 is projected to be 527 million 
tons while utilization is estimated to be about 537 million tons 
according to agriculture department data 
over the past month deteriorating spring wheat prospects in 
the northern hemisphere have resulted in a significant tightening 
in world wheat supplies the department said 
even with the prospects for smaller supplies world wheat 
utilization is expected to reach a record high necessitating 
another drawdown in world wheat stocks said the department 
as a result there will be more imports by many countries and 
trade is expected to exceed 99 million tons agriculture officials

marijuana has caught up with alcohol as a 
factor in fatal traffic accidents involving truckers a national 
transportation safety board member says 
james burnett speaking thursday to the arkansas municipal 
police association cited a yearlong ntsb study in which truck 
drivers involved in fatalities were tested for 44 drugs 
the safety board has not released the results yet but burnett 
said they will demonstrate a very high rate of drug and alcohol 
use in accidents in which truck drivers are killed the final 
data will show that marijuana abuse as a factor has caught up with 
alcohol 
investigators also are finding the presence of cocaine 
amphetamines and methamphetamine all stimulants burnett said 
drugs most abused by truck drivers are the ones they perceive 
as those that can help them make it through the night so to 
speak he said 
burnett said hes not suggesting that many truck drivers use 
drugs only that drugs or alcohol are present in a very high 
percentage of those accidents in which they kill themselves or 
others 
he said fatigue is another major factor in accidents that kill 
about 800 truckers each year studies indicate a sharp increase in 
accidents after a trucker drives eight hours or six hours pulling 
two trailers he said 
another study indicates that economics is a factor in driver 
fatigue burnett said drivers being paid by the mile or trip had 
an incentive to keep going to maximize their income 
this is not to say that most drivers are fatigued burnett 
said but among those killed many worked beyond the legal limit 
burnett said local police need to be trained to inspect 
truckers log books and have the authority to bring charges when 
infractions of drivers rules are discovered

publisher john l seigenthaler of the tennessean was subpoened 
to give a deposition tuesday and had filed a motion to quash the 
order us district judge john t nixon ordered the deposition 
delayed while he considers the request 
the comments from the source were printed in a september 1984 
story in the tennessean about the firing of william j small as 
head of the wire service 
small later sued upi seeking 10 million and alleging breach of 
contract he also claimed upi and several of its executives libeled 
him in explaining the reasons for his departure 
seigenthaler said in court papers filed thursday that

a judge heard arguments behind closed 
doors friday in a mans request to prevent his estranged wife from 
having an abortion but made no decision 
im going to have to study a little bit of the law said 
harrison county circuit judge daniel mccarthy who granted requests 
by each side to make the proceedings private and adjourned the 
hearing after more than three hours he gave no indication of when 
he would rule saying were going to have to move quickly in 
this case and we will but we need to do more research 
burton anderson 24 asked mccarthy to prevent his estranged 
wife melonie from ending her 4month pregnancy on the grounds 
that it would cause him irreparable harm and suffering 
on monday mccarthy issued a temporary order blocking the 
abortion the judge was being asked to issue a permanent injunction 
andersons attorney mike aloi said mccarthy wanted both sides 
to submit briefs by monday hopefully hell have a decision to 
us by early next week aloi said adding that the judge has 
sealed the file 
aloi said the judges temporary order involved a pending divorce 
and that such cases in west virginia traditionally are heard in a 
judges chambers 
this is a very private and personal matter and we want to 
limit the publics involvement as much as possible added melonie 
andersons attorney mary kay hansen she declined comment as she 
left the hearing with her client 
aloi said the case could break new legal ground in light of the 
us supreme courts recent ruling in a missouri case which gave 
states greater power to regulate abortions 
the high court also refused to hear the case of a michigan man 
who wanted to block his estranged wife from having an abortion 
clearing the way for her to terminate her 11week pregnancy 
the supreme court made an erroneous decision to make it an 
absolute right for a woman to have an abortion an abortion 
obviously impacts on the father it also impacts on the siblings 
said wanda franz president of west virginians for life and a vice 
president of the national right to life committee 
the supreme court ruling opens the door for us to evaluate 
what rights need to be considered besides the rights of the 
mother franz said i think any ruling that would recognize 
that the father also has a concern for his own children and a right 
to care for that child would be a victory 
the andersons who have no children have been married a year 
mrs anderson 20 has expressed concern about her husbands 
ability to financially support her and a child and has maintained 
that she should be able to decide whether to continue her pregnancy 
anderson a truck driver says he should have an equal say on 
whether the pregnancy should be terminated 
aloi said mrs anderson aborted an earlier pregnancy without 
telling her husband 
he thought it was going to be different this time he thought 
they were going to have the baby aloi said then he found out 
from a third party that she was going to have an abortion 
aloi said the divorce action was filed to get the court to stop 
mrs anderson from ending her pregnancy 
this is not a divorce action aloi said my clients 
information was that she had an abortion planned for tuesday 
morning time was of the essence we needed to get into court as 
soon as possible 
about a dozen women and children most of them andersons 
neighbors gathered outside the courthouse friday to support him 
carrying signs that read abortion out family in and wearing 
tshirts which read kids have a right to live

of west germanys lufthansa airlines office in la paz shipped more

bolivia took more than 100 paintings and works of art out of the 
country utilizing the advantages that the airline at his disposal 
offered 
it claimed that liedtke took out of the country the equivalent 
number of pieces that would fill two museums of this type he could 
not ignore the clear laws on this matter which prohibit the export 
under any circumstances of bolivias historical past

the energy department said friday a special 
team of investigators could find no evidence that an uncontrolled 
nuclear chain reaction ever occurred at the rocky flats weapons 
plant near denver 
plutonium however was found in situations that require 
immediate attention the department said 
it did not detail just what those situations were or what would 
be done about them 
plutonium is the nuclear material recovered from weapons being 
retired and reprocessed at rocky flats to make triggers for new 
weapons it is highly toxic 
the question of a chain reaction at the plant arose after the 
discovery of radioactive isotopes of strontium and cesium that do 
not occur in nature in ground water near the plant some plant 
employees claimed that conditions existed routinely that could lead 
to a chain reaction 
an uncontrolled chain reaction produces an explosion in a bomb 
and a controlled reaction is the basis for nuclear power plants 
without the special bomb assembly the release of energy in an 
accidental chain reaction would normally disperse the radioactive 
constituents below the necessary critical mass or 
criticality before a large explosion could occur but the 
radioactivity produced could be fatal in a small area 
officials from the environmental protection agency and state 
agencies said the strontium and cesium radioactivity was so low 
that it was almost undetectable and might have been the result of 
fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s 
the team of experts from outside the department and its 
contractor rockwell international corp was appointed by 
secretary james watkins under a june 16 agreement with the state 
it is due to report before sept 30 fridays announcement was 
based on a briefing for rocky flats managers the office of gov 
roy romer and the state health department the energy department 
said 
based on the evidence examined to date at the plant including 
measurement of radioactive cesium and strontium in the soil and 
water records of past operations criticality procedural 
infractions plant renovations fires and radiation exposures the 
team reported that it strongly supports a conclusion that an 
accidental criticality has never occurred at rocky flats despite 
allegations to the contrary reported in the past the team said 
the team also reported that plutonium was found in situations 
that require immediate attention and certain safety practices need 
prompt correction 
the team said rocky flats needs to pay more attention to 
preventing human error and mitigating what happens when it occurs 
to improve monitoring of process flow lines and vents to improve 
safety analysis the final report will also call for design 
improvements to process lines and plutonium storage and assessment 
of the chance of accidental assembly of a critical mass because of 
an earthquake or fire the department said 
rocky flats has come under much criticism recently for polluting 
the environment and the fbi has begun an investigation of past 
practices

gen manuel noriegas defense forces 
detained four vehicles full of us military police friday but 
later freed them after discussions between officers of both 
countries 
the us southern command called the detention of the military 
policemen unjustified and said in a news release that it had 
deployed several armored vehicles backed by helicopters in the 
area 
the vehicles were freed after us military officers discussed 
the situation with officers of the defense forces the news 
release said without elaborating 
the incident the latest of several confrontations between 
panamanian and american troops occurred in an area known as 
curundu near the panama canal 
panamas maj carlos saldana told reporters the incident started 
when american troops went around in civilian clothes with their 
weapons riding in private vehicles in violation of the panama 
canal treaties 
no country in the world can accept that units claiming to be 
part of an army move in within its territory armed and in civilian 
clothes if they tried to do this in any other nation they would be 
killed like common muggers like a vulgar thief saldana added 
southern commands news release said the area is shared by 
forces of the two countries but saldana said it has been an 
exclusively panamanian military zone for several years 
the incident occurred hours after the military accused the 
united states of intimidation and treaty violations and the 
foreign minister said panama was an invasion site in which only 
the order to fire is lacking 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
earlier friday that president bush would not rule out seizing 
panamas de facto leader gen manuel antonio noriega to face 
charges in florida in a federal narcotics case fitzwater said 
however that bush was not contemplating such a move 
noriega commander of the defense forces said thursday he would 
not yield to us demands that he step down he marks six years as 
commander on saturday 
panama will not bow to the law of force that those barbarians 
from the north their panamanian lackeys and tame politicians are 
trying to impose and will not grovel before the united 
states he told a group of retired military officers 
the opposition presidential candidate in may 7 general 
elections guillermo endara accused noriega late friday of 
subservience to the united states and called him a dictator 
we never were and never will be employees of the cia while he 
himself was one endara said in an interview 
endara said he wanted to be president of a people free of ties 
with the outside and unbound by the chains of dictators at home 
tyranny at home is just as bad as foreign occupation 
international observers said endara won the may 7 election by a 
landslide but noriegas government annulled the election 
noriega on friday labeled a plebiscite proposed by the 
opposition for aug 20 on whether noriega should stay or go as 
tantamount to turning panama into a colony that accepts 
arrogance vassalage and indignity 
he spoke during a parade of thousands of defense forces troops 
and paramilitary civilian units who ended a 10day exercise friday 
dubbed zap the intruder 
noriegas comments were his first public reaction to the 
confrontations between his forces and us troops which have 
included arrests on both sides and a blockade of fort amador by 
american soldiers 
us officials say they have the right to conduct exercises 
under the 1977 panama canal treaties to assure canal security 
noriega accuses the united states of seeking to abrogate the 
treaties and keep the canal which is to be turned over to panama 
at the end of 1999 
in new york foreign minister jorge ritter asked the un 
security council to send military observers to panama to prevent 
the us army from instigating confrontations as a pretext for 
armed intervention 
what the situation in panama calls for is the presence of 
military observers which we hope would be able to go as early as 
next monday he said 
us ambassador herbert s okun said all us military 
activities in panama were conducted in complete accord with the 
panama canal treaties and recent exercises were a response to 
the hostile actions of the noriega regime 
the united states has been trying to force noriega out since two 
federal grand juries in florida indicted him last year on drug 
trafficking and money laundering charges noriega denies the 
charges

the supreme court on friday upheld a 
ruling granting amnesty to 38 members of the military and two 
civilians who had been indicted in the disappearence of 10 members 
of the outlawed communist party 
the unanimous ruling cannot be appealed 
the court ruled that the 40 who included a former air force 
commander were covered by an amnesty law issued by the military 
government 
the opposition which is favored in polls to win the dec 14 
presidential election has promised to repeal the 1978 law 
it says it will investigate the human rights violations occurred 
since military president augusto pinochet seized power in a bloody 
1973 coup and bring those responsible for them to trial 
military leaders however have warned that repealing the law 
would have unpredictable consequences 
the amnesty law covers crimes including human rights abuses 
that occurred from sept 11 1973 when elected president salvador 
allende was overthrown to march 11 1978 
among the defendants were retired air force gen gustavo leigh 
a former member of the fourmen military junta led by pinochet that 
took power after the coup leigh retired in 1978 
also covered by the amnesty were two other air force generals 
and a national police general all retired 
after seizing power the military jailed thousands of members 
and supporters of the toppled leftist government some were 
tortured and killed and thousands were forced into exile 
the roman catholic church and human rights groups here and 
abroad have documented the cases of more than 700 disidents who 
disappeared after being arrested by security agents 
the group granted definite amnesty today had been indicted by a 
civilian judge carlos cerda in the cases of 10 members of the 
communist party members who disappeared after being arrested in 
1976 
after judge cerda filed the charges however the santiago 
appeals court ordered him to stop the proceedings and apply the 
amnesty law in the case 
cerda refused but the appeals court suspended him from his job 
for two months applying the amnesty law that suspension also was 
upheld friday by the supreme court

a frustrated spokeswoman for rep mickey 
leland lashed out friday at us efforts to find the missing 
congressman saying work should get going with the kind of steam 
the kind of urgency that president bush promised 
it just seems to me that with all of the sophisticated 
surveillance that we have with all of the sophisticated equipment 
we have we could have and should have located them by now said 
alma newsom 
what has taken the us forces so long to gain momentum she 
asked im not suggesting there is a lack of commitment from 
the top i believe president bush fully expected that everything 
that all stops had been pulled out at any rate it isnt 
happening 
bush the state department and the defense department defended 
the efforts to find leland dtexas whose plane disappeared in 
ethiopia on the way to a refugee camp 
the president said i can understand the anxiety of all this 
and i can understand the concern that people that love mickey 
leland feel and that i feel but theres a lot going on so lets 
just hope and pray hes ok 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said i 
know the president and the secretary of state deeply and sincerely 
empathize with the frustration with the tension with the 
situation shes having to deal with 
ms tutwiler denied there had been any breakdown in the search 
effort 
later presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater issued a 
statement calling the us commitment to the search the largest 
most comprehensive undertaking in recent memory 
fitzwater recounted the resources including air force planes 
that the united states had committed to the search effort for 
lelands plane which was carrying eight americans and seven other 
people in addition to the congressman when it disappeared 
the us commitment coupled with thousands of ethiopians 
making ground searches will continue he said 
however ms newsom said lelands staff believes somebody had 
dropped the ball in the search for leland who vanished monday 
after his plane took off from addis ababa for a refugee camp on the 
sudanese border 
she said she was appealing to bush to issue a strong statement 
to all of his people that this is a priority theyve got to work 
together and they have got to get their act together and find 
congressman leland and his party that is unequivocal 
ms newsom said she and others gathered in lelands office had 
spent the night calling other congressmen to urge the pentagon to 
move more quickly 
two of those contacted reps jack fields rtexas and ron 
coleman dtexas said they called administration officials 
fields said he doesnt believe there is a lack of commitment at 
the top but that the rescue may have been slowed by the logistics 
of moving personnel and equipment to ethiopia as well as that 
countrys failure to immediately signal it welcomed us help 
friday night timmy jensen of leland staff said the staff was 
encouraged by word that helicopters would be searching friday 
despite a weather report that isnt very good 
the more up there looking for them the better she said 
state department spokeswoman tutwiler said that as of friday the 
defense department had sent a c141 with a 35person medical team 
two hc130 search and rescue aircraft each with a parachute team 
two c141s with spare parts and support equipment a c21 to 
transport u2 film a c5 with four mh60 helicopters two more 
hc130s were dispatched from eglin air force base in florida 
in a statement detailing additional efforts the pentagon said 
two u2 photographic reconnaissance planes had exposed more than a 
mile of film in runs over the 56000square mile search area of 
which about 60 percent was covered by clouds 
this is an area as large as that contained by a line from new 
york city to nagshead nc to pittsburgh and back to new york or 
in texas from dallas to houston to midland and back to dallas the 
pentagonn said 
the pentagon said it was sending an additional ec130 equipped 
as a command and control craft and additional flight crews so that 
each airplane and helicopter would have two crews assigned and 
could be put to maximum use 
as of friday 170 us military personnel had been assigned to 
the search and the number soon would reach 260 the pentagon said 
air force maj gen james f record director of operations for 
central command will leave saturday to take charge of the effort 
in ethiopia the pentagon said 
two us air force hc130 hercules cargo planes equipped to 
detect emergency signals from downed aircraft flew over the areas 
thursday without hearing anything and ground parties reported no 
sightings two ethiopian air force helicopters also came up blank 
on friday the hc130s were back flying parallel routes along a 
200mile portion of the missing planes presumed path

a federal judge on friday decided to allow 
police to use pain compliance techniques against antiabortion 
protesters affiliated with operation rescue 
such techniques involve bending a wrist or arm backward against 
its joint and increasingly the use of a an oriential martial 
arts weapon known as nunchakus 
us district judge a wallace tashima in refusing to issue a 
temporary restraining order said lawyers failed to show that 
abortion foes were likely to be injured 
i think under the law of this state officers are entitled 
to use such reasonable force as necessary to take the person into 
custody tashima said 
tashima also said that the abortion foes lawyers had failed to 
show a protest was likely to occur saturday 
essentially the judge said theres no case in controversy 
because we dont know theres going to be a demonstration 
tomorrow said samuel b casey a lawyer representing six 
antiabortion protesters 
we will enforce the law as we have in the past said 
commander william booth a police spokesman and when we have to 
make an arrest if there are resistances pain compliance will be 
used 
the nunchakus used by police which booth described as a come 
along device consists of two footlong pieces of plastic that 
are attached by a cord and are used like walnut crackers on a 
persons arm or leg 
tashima said the issues presented by the case were novel but he 
was not persuaded that antiabortion protesters are entitled to 
court protection said jack brown an assistant city attorney 
he said there was a question as to whether the demonstrators 
were resisting arrest said brown who represented the police 
department in the hearing 
instead of issuing the emergency restraining order sought by 
casey tashima set a hearing for oct 2 to consider further 
evidence and arguments 
police in los angeles developed pain compliance to counter 
operation rescues strategy of illegally blocking entrances to a 
womens health clinic and delaying arrests to keep the clinic 
closed 
operation rescue protesters are taught a variety of methods to 
passively resist arrest some have smeared their arms and legs with 
petroleum jelly to make it more difficult for arresting officers to 
grip them 
the request for a temporary restraining order was filed thursday 
by the rutherford institute of california a conservative 
christianoriented public interest group

a summer thundershower rolled across 
the south dakota prairie friday as the remains of seminole indians 
were reburied near the site where sioux indians were killed by 
soldiers almost a century ago 
about 1200 pounds of prehistoric remains of members of the 
seminole tribe were returned to the earth after being stored in 
boxes at the university of south dakota for the past three years 
a traditional ceremony was held friday evening less than a mile 
from the cemetery where sioux indians were buried following the 
slaying of more than 200 sioux on dec 29 1890 by soldiers of the 
us armys 7th cavalry 
the 1890 assault known as the wounded knee massacre to indians 
and a battle to the us army was one of the last major conflicts 
between indians and soldiers it occurred just 14 days after 
sitting bull was killed on the standing rock reservation 
theres an awful lot of power here this is a powerful 
place said mike haney a representative of the seminole tribe of 
oklahoma who was asked by tribal leaders in florida to attend the 
ceremony 
one of the reasons im here is because im from the alligater 
clan of the seminole people haney said traditionally we the 
clan bury our people 
indians and archaeologists took turns digging a 6footdeep 
grave atop a hill surrounded by pine trees 
we want them to dig we want them to finish the job they 
started said roger byrd a spiritual leader of the oglala sioux 
who said prayers over the gravesite which will become part of the 
national indian cemetery 
as indians we are all the same and we return to the ground the 
same byrd said 
arrangements for the reburial were made with the help of 
american indians against desecration a group that has been 
fighting for reburial rights for the past decade 
were making sure we bury these people in a place that will 
never be touched by archaeologists jan bear shield a founder of 
aiad said that is why we picked wounded knee as long as there 
is an indian alive they will never touch it 
it is not known how many skeletons were buried friday because 
the remains which included earth and seminole burial articles 
were not studied by archaeologists 
larry zimmerman a professor of anthropology at the university 
of south dakota was asked by members of the seminole tribe to 
catalog the contents of the boxes containing the remains they 
appeared to be prehistoric he said 
the remains were unearthed at a construction site near tampa 
fla 
zimmerman was part of a similar reburial in 1981 following the 
discovery of 500 people ancestors to the contemporary arikaras at 
the crow creek archaeological site near fort thompson the 
skeletons found at that site in 1978 were all victims of a massacre 
that scientists have said occurred before white men arrived in the 
region 
the ceremony at wounded knee on the pine ridge reservation 
followed a fourday world archaelogical congress symposium on the 
reburial issue 
at the intercongress the executive committee introduced the 
vermillion accord which calls for increased cooperation between 
indigenous people and the scientific community when deaing with 
archaeological remains 
about 200 people from 20 nations attended the conference which 
ended thursday in vermillion 
some of the archaeologists who were at the conference also were 
at the reburial and took part in digging the grave 
i feel satisfied comfortable about it zimmerman said 
although these bones werent dug up by archaeologists i think it 
is important to get them back

a woman who fled new hampshire with her two 
young children in november after a court gave their custody to her 
exhusband was found friday and the children taken from her 
i have no idea how they found me jesse murabito 40 said 
in a telephone interview after two law officers and a social worker 
entered the home she rents here and took her 6yearold daughter 
and 4yearold son 
the boy started screaming and crying she said crying 
herself he didnt want to leave me he said momma dont let 
them take me 
she said the authorities told her the children would be put in a 
foster home until a hearing thursday in fort benton in the 12th 
judicial district in chouteau county 
they had to carry out my daughter mrs murabito said i 
have no idea where they are they wont tell me 
fort benton sheriff paul williams who helped take the children 
from their home said mrs murabito cried and screamed as her 
children were taken away 
the kids were crying because their mother was crying 
williams said she was screaming and yelling and i think that 
upset the kids 
diann button a social worker for the montana department of 
family services accompanied sheriffs deputies to mrs murabitos 
home in this town of about 80 people on the missouri river about 
125 miles northeast of helena 
button said the children have been placed in a foster home in 
the area but would not say where she said she talked to the 
children but theyre pretty confused right now 
mrs murabito her exhusband mark russell murabito and others 
involved in the case will be at next weeks hearing the social 
worker said 
raymond kellett a lawyer for mark murabito said friday night 
that this is the first time since november that murabito has known 
where his children are his client will fly to montana to attend 
the hearing the lawyer said 
hes very relieved that the children have been found 
kellett said mr murabito is very relieved and happy at the 
prospects of getting the children back 
kellett said he contacted williams on thursday about the 
children but would not disclose how he had learned about mrs 
murabitos whereabouts williams said he knew nothing of the case 
until contacted by kellett 
the case attracted national attention during the couples 
divorce proceedings when mrs murabito went to jail for a week in 
february 1987 rather than tell the court her childrens whereabouts 
murabito 34 of derry nh was indicted in march 1988 on a 
charge of sexually abusing the daughter but acquitted during a 
twoweek trial in november 
a superior court judge in new hampshire then stripped her of the 
childrens custody awarded him joint custody with the state mrs 
murabito disappeared the same day with the children 
she said she has been living in loma since april under the name 
of pat gibeau mrs murabito said she had a friend living there 
previously they had stopped in san francisco and other places she 
said but declined to elaborate 
ive been trying to protect my children its been so hard for 
me so hard mrs murabito said 
she said earlier this year during telephone conversations with 
reporters from undisclosed locations that she had used a nationwide 
underground railway to flee

in southern honduras near the nicaraguan border for the past 
year they have received only nonlethal aid from the united states 
such as boots and foodstuffs 
president ortega has promised to hold free and fair national 
elections on feb 25 he also got nicaraguas 20 opposition 
political parties to back the peace plan 
a spokesman for protestant denominations in nicaragua said 
all us churches could use the accord as a weapon to demand that 
their government should not interfere in the regions affairs 
the rev miguel angelo caso an evangelist called the tela 
accord a painful and bloody birth in which a spark of life is 
present 
in san jose costa rica president oscar arias received a 
message from mikhail gorbachev in which the soviet president said 
moscow would send no more arms to nicaragua

the nations health officials are scrambling to 
contain a 370 percent rise in the number of measles cases after 
years in which the old childhood nemesis virtually disappeared as a 
public health problem 
more than 8400 people have caught measles so far in 1989 and 
as many as 25 have died according to the national centers for 
disease control in atlanta 
its not really clear why its probably a variety of 
things said dr william atkinson of the cdc 
lack of immunizations is playing a big part especially in inner 
city hispanic and black neighborhoods where many youngsters are 
going without the measlesmumpsrubella vaccinations they should 
receive starting at 15 months of age 
we have to reach the parents and really convince them of the 
importance of having the child vaccinated atkinson said 
wednesday there are publicly funded clinics where children can 
receive vaccines for little or no cost

the college football season probably will be 
over by then but abcs coach will be back on the gridiron 
sometime around the middle of the 198990 television season 
creator and executive producer barry kemp blames himself for 
creating the impression that the show which premiered midseason 
last season had been canceled by abc he had been disappointed 
that it wasnt in abcs starting lineup and took his time accepting 
the order for 13 new episodes so when abc announced its fall 
schedule the fate of coach was unknown 
i wasnt real happy about being a backup show last year 
said kemp during a visit to new york its just hard to be a show 
about football in the fall and not be able to go on in the fall 
but now that theyve put us on this summer behind roseanne i 
think that shows a lot of faith in us 
indeed coach has been exposed to a much wider audience 
behind the hit sitcom on tuesday night this summer 
kemp who was executive script consultant on taxi for three 
seasons and created and produced newhart coming of age and 
the comedy miniseries fresno said he had spent about two years 
developing coach 
craig t nelson plays hayden fox head coach of minnesota state 
his life is turned upsidedown when his 19yearold daughter kelly 
clare carey from his longsincedissolved marriage enrolls at 
the university jerry van dyke in a role created for him plays 
relentlessly negative assistant coach luther van dam who gets in 
trouble for accepting a steak he won by betting against his own 
team shelley fabares is christine armstrong a local newswoman who 
is haydens steady date bill fagerbakke is perpetual student 
dauber dybinski whose academic inertia might possibly stem from 
his insistence on taking only courses that are taught in proximity 
to his dorm 
but it was the charismatic character of a college football coach 
that drew him to the idea of the series said kemp who describes 
himself as an avid football fan 
i was real interested in the whole phenomenon that had 
happened in the last decade or so where the prominence of coaches 
had become such they were really more prominent than the players in 
many cases he said 
he was also attracted to doing a show about a guy who was 45 
years old and was just starting to come to terms with the fact that 
he had basically devoted his life to achieving some kind of career 
goal and had risked his marriage and his family life and his 
personal relationships in order to attain that and was just 
starting to come to terms with the fact that it was not going to be 
all he hoped it would be and had to start trying to mend the 
fences he had broken through the years i thought that an 
interesting emotional dilemma for a man that age and that really 
appealed to me 
nelson who is best known for his movie roles in such dramatic 
fare as poltergeist would not immediately leap to most minds as 
the star of a sitcom but kemp said he was interested enough in the 
actor that he talked to him about the coach concept even before 
the script was written 
i think the reaction a lot of people had was i didnt think 
craig nelson could be funny kemp said but he wanted more than a 
sitcom actor and the imposing nelson fit the bill 
i wanted hayden fox to have an edge i wanted a really good 
actor to play him kemp said adding that fox walks that pretty 
fine moral line between whats considered right and whats 
considered wrong and hes not always real clear about it so he 
fights that dilemma within himself all the time and that makes him 
interesting 
kemp who grew up in iowa set coach at the fictitious 
minnesota state mainly to be realistic its not a top 40 school 
but maybe top 100 sometimes the school sounds a little too 
realistic 
one of the guys in the show was wearing the sweatshirt one day 
that had the logo on it kemp said and he was in a 7eleven 
and the guy behind the counter said hey i went to that school

writerproducer steve sohmer says he sees the 
hero of his upcoming nbc series as an oldfashioned idealist whos 
a dinosaur in todays fbi 
the show mancuso fbi starring robert loggia as nick 
mancuso is a spinoff from the miniseries thriller favorite son 
sohmer who wrote the bestselling novel about political 
corruption in washington and adapted it for the miniseries said 
what excites him most about mancuso is that idealism 
hes had a lifelong love affair with the constitution he 
said but when you look at him you know only blind justice would 
choose this man as her champion everyone underestimates him hes 
the hero of the 1990s because he believes passionately in his 
country and wishes the country would live up to its principles 
the miniseries which ran last fall prior to the presidential 
election told of a conspiracy to boost the candidacy of a handsome 
senator for vice president at the time republicans protested that 
there were certain similarities to candidate dan quayle sohmer 
pointed out that the book was written and the miniseries was filmed 
long before anyone knew quayle would be the republican candidate

ron howard recalls how his early life as a 
child actor on the andy griffith show led to his becoming a 
director 
i loved the environment of a movie set it was always fun it 
was work and there was some discipline involved but it was fun 
for me when i got a little older 789 i became interested in 
the camera you know how boys are interested in gadgets i spent a 
lot of time hanging around with the camera crew he said 
i soon saw that the director was the person who got to hang 
out with the actors which was fun and he also got to hang around 
the camera and look through it and make decisions about it very 
early on i thought that was going to be an interesting job and 
id like to try it 
howard didnt wait long at 21 he directed a cheapie for roger 
corman grand theft auto after leaving the happy days tv 
series he made a successful comedy with his series costar henry 
winkler and michael keaton next came his splash smash 
followed by cocoon gung ho and willow 
now parenthood 
its really the first time that ive done a movie that was 
personal to me said howard and its the first time ive done 
a movie that was one of my own ideas 
the inception came with a horrendous plane flight which he and 
his wife were able to laugh about later he thought that if they 
could laugh about such a happening perhaps comedy could be found 
in other serious matters such as raising children 
howard father of three daughters began collecting other such 
stories from his own memory and those of friends he worked with 
his regular writers lowell ganz and babaloo mandel to develop the 
script of parenthood 
how do todays parents differ from a generation ago 
the baby boomer group of which im a member dont seem to go 
at anything halfway he said now that theyre turning their 
attention to family and childrearing theyre doing it with a real 
fervor a real commitment they want to be different theyve 
always wanted to be different and better and have more 
information and more choices its a more complicated time 
the central figure of parenthood is steve martin as a 
husband who tries to balance his work with the responsibilities of 
fatherhood surrounding him is a family that includes mary 
steenburgen jason robards tom hulce dianne wiest rick moranis 
martha plimpton and keanu reeves 
howard said he had no trouble keeping the ensemble cast happy 
they all believed in the script they had a lot of fun when they 
were there i didnt have to do any of the handholding and 
egomassaging that i frankly expected would be an important part of 
my job 
they loved the ensemble nature of the film these are all 
people who starred in their own movies in a way i think they kind 
of enjoyed not having that kind of responsibility and yet still 
being a part of something they believed in 
seven movies isnt a great body of work for a director but 
howard believes a pattern may have emerged 
i tend to be characteroriented he said even when i was 
doing fantasies like splash and willow and cocoon what was 
in it for me was the scenes in which the actors could shine i 
think parenthood is an extension of that with all the scifi 
stuff stripped away

old problems generally can benefit from fresh 
insight that insight might not solve them in a flash but often it 
can reroute the intellectual pursuit helping to hurdle or sidestep 
obstacles 
americans for example are forever being berated by economists 
for lax savings habits and the japanese are often praised for 
theirs that perspective has existed for years and nobodys done 
anything about it 
john reed doesnt think thats right reed chairman of citicorp 
and its chief banking subsidiary citibank views the scene from a 
different perspective 
in a briefing for members of congress about the growing service 
industry he is chairman of the board of the coalition of service 
industries reed offered this observation 
we put our savings in houses on a gross basis we save more 
than the japanese but some of that savings is utilized by 
households as trillions of dollars worth of investment in mortgages 
by the standards of american culture we are not sustaining a 
pattern of bad habits rather we use our savings for things that 
most of the congress would view as socially good and desirable 
in our business financial and other services we must 
intermediate the worlds capital flow so that us industry can 
have the benefit of the lowcost savings of japan 
the pool of savings that exists in japan is equivalent to the 
pool of oil that exists in saudi arabia on the margin oil in 
saudi arabia has no value whatever 
if there were a law that said saudis could not export oil they 
would not know what to do with it if there were a law in japan 
saying the japanese could not export capital they would also not 
know what to do with it 
in short the effect of these cultural differences between japan 
and america may be thought of as complementary rather than in 
terms of japanese strength and american weakness 
reed did lament one aspect of this financial flow it is a 
great tragedy he said that developing countries are not able 
to tap these pools of savings almost all such flows he said 
are toward developed countries 
this latter observation relates to another lamentable situation 
identified in the state of the nations housing 1989 a study 
by harvard universitys joint center for housing studies 
as popularly perceived two of the major socioeconomic problems 
today are inadequate housing for the poor and a growing gap between 
the rich and the poor the centers study indicates the problems 
might be one and the same 
that study showed that in 1986 only 115 percent or 128 million 
of the estimated 111 million renter households in the 2534 age 
group had both the required cash and incomes high enough to qualify 
for a starter home mortgage 
the bigger of the problems was the down payment 81 percent 
lacked the accumulated wealth needed to close on a mortgage 
question can such families save fast enough to overcome the 
rising levels of downpayments required recent history suggests 
many of them cannot because housing prices and downpayments have 
risen faster than wage increases 
unable to buy many of these households are forced to remain 
poor home ownership it has been demonstrated repeatedly is the 
most efficient way for households of limited means to acquire 
sizable equity ie wealth 
in short the house is the vehicle that closes the gap between 
rich and poor but it is a vehicle the poor often cannot board 
there are seats on the vehicle but there is a fare to be paid too 
and the poor havent got it 
various solutions to the dilemma have been offered but the best 
approach is open to debate still one of those approaches cannot 
be easily dismissed because it might even pay for itself the 
center points out 
over time the incomes of many young owners are likely to 
increase and as noted homeownership usually yields substantial 
equity buildup 
in many instances financial assistance with the upfront 
costs or mortgage payments could be repaid in full or in part over 
the course of the loan or when the home is sold 
in short by helping people to own housing we help bridge the 
gap between the rich and the poor and by taking the savings of the 
japanese we provide them with a good return for their troubles 
while buying houses for ourselves

life as a rock star in preglasnost russia 
wasnt allnight parties screaming fans or mtv promos boris 
grebenshikov didnt deal with groupies he was questioned by the 
kgb 
they would talk to me and tell me dont say a word to 
anyone and of course i would tell everyone it was the only 
weapon i had said grebenshikov an underground rock phenomenon 
in the soviet union since 1972 
grebenshikov survived his outlaw status releasing a dozen 
albums actually bootlegged cassettes through the soviet 
unions black market things are different now he sits in a 
friends manhattan penthouse apartment to discuss radio 
silence his debut western album 
my life was saved by rock n roll absolutely said 
grebenshikov speaking perfect english while chainsmoking soviet 
cigarettes 
he worked without his band aquarium on radio silence 
instead grebenshikov hooked up with dave stewart of eurythmics 
who produced the album other highpowered help was brought in as 
well stewarts partner annie lennox the pretenders chrissie 
hynde and actor harry dean stanton all contribute vocals to the 
album 
while grebenshikov appreciates their help and friendship this 
rock n roll innocents introduction to the music industry in the 
united states has been less than pleasant 
an appearance on late night with david letterman rankled 
letterman insisted on talking about how much money grebenshikov 
might make grebenshikov filmed a rushjob video in times square 
asked about it he sadly shakes his head 
the nonstop promotional whirl which includes a tour now 
underway also was a shock and theres the emphasis on selling 
records which grebenshikov dismisses with a twosyllable american 
obscenity 
you go to tower records and you have rows and rows of 
product but maybe three or four good records he says 
disdainfully 
this wasnt what grebenshikov knew as rock n roll when he sat 
in his bedroom in the soviet union twisting the radio dial in a 
frantic search for the music which he said would set him free 
each beatles single was a revelation his early exposure to bob 
dylan had the same intense effect on him as it did on a new jersey 
teenager a world away bruce springsteen 
i remember hearing i want you i could understand about 
maybe 70 percent but i thought to myself this is it this is the 
sound said grebenshikov 35 who wrote in english for the first 
time on radio silence 
he went on to form aquarium in 1972 in short order he was both 
kicked out of the communist youth league for his musical efforts 
and dubbed the soviet dylan he also became the focus of eric 
claptonesque graffiti boris is god in leningrad 
grebenshikov is unsure how many aquarium tapes are out there in 
the soviet union once the group was legitimized by the government 
its first three albums sold 3 million copies on the official 
melodiya label 
not that numbers matter to the charismatic grebenshikov they 
dont neither does a perfect mix or exacting production on his 
records hes more interested in how a record feels when he listens 
to it 
i dont really care how good it sounds i care about what am 
i doing is the inspiration here cause people tend to hide behind 
the sound even if its a perfect thing sounds great i dont 
care i just dont care says grebenshikov 
give me some sounds so we can fly with it we can soar with 
it i dont care about how it sounds if its right its 
right

the man who sang the eternal question 
woman have you got cheating on your mind is back with a new 
sound and harsh criticism for the music of the 1980s 
gary puckett minus the union gap plans to release his first 
album in nearly 20 years this fall and warns his old fans not to 
expect the same old sound 
if they want another record like young girl its not what 
theyre going to get he said you cant make a record that 
sounds like 1968 
but its still me singing the voice is recognizable 
the 46yearold pucketts booming voice was one of the most 
recognizable in rock in the late 60s he grew up in yakima and 
named his original band after this small suburb but he contends 
that the band name was initially chosen because of his interest in 
the civil war and especially the union forces 
when i thought of that i decided why not call it union gap 
puckett said it meant something to me it was a sneaky little 
twist nobody would understand 
the name also allowed the group to dress up in civil war 
uniforms with puckett wearing the rank of general 
but the whole issue is academic because the union gap broke up 
over creative differences in 1971 and puckett now tours with three 
different musicians as the gary puckett band 
puckett who lives in san diego calif hasnt had a new record 
since 1971 but has signed an agreement with avm america inc a 
record company based in venice calif and plans to have a new 
album out in the fall 
avm is a new company whose president terry powell was a 
publicist for cbs records during pucketts prime the 196769 
period when the union gap came out with such songs as woman 
woman over you this girl is a woman now and lady 
willpower 
pucketts ongoing popularity in germany inspired the company to 
sign him and produce an album powell said we think very highly 
of gary he said all his old records are very popular in 
europe 
while puckett hasnt released a record since 1971s keep the 
customer satisfied he has not been idle he performed on the 
happy together reunion tour of several 1960s bands in 1984 and was 
an opening act for the monkees recent reunion tour 
for the past few years he has been playing fairs and family 
festivals his audiences have primarily been his own age group and 
youngsters who are turned off by heavy metal 
its amazing how many of them are disdainful of hard rock 
puckett said theyre not into the headbanger stuff its kind of 
encouraging 
heavy metal and rap music deserve their own categories he said 
dont call it rock 
puckett was born in hibbing minn and his family moved to 
yakima when he was 5 the family spent a couple of years in tacoma 
before moving back to yakima when puckett was in the sixth grade 
they moved again near the end of his junior year of high school 
and he graduated from high school in twin falls idaho he formed 
the band while a college student at san diego state in the 
mid1960s 
despite his roots in the region puckett rarely makes it back to 
the pacific northwest his performance at the central washington 
state fair in 1987 was his first time back in years he said he 
was recently here to perform at an antique car show 
some of the people i knew came to the fair he said but 
there was kind of a lot of distance between us its hard to 
remember back but i always remember it as my home 
there has been talk of reuniting the original union gap but 
several of the other members have commitments and would have to 
take a left turn puckett said it just didnt happen

anythings possible in oz and just about 
everythings possible in hollywood 
like dorothy as a blonde 
when shooting first began on the wizard of oz director 
richard thorpe put judy garland in a blond wig he was later fired 
and replaced by victor fleming gone with the wind and king 
vidor garland ditched the golden locks and played the movie in her 
own hair and a fall 
the wizard of oz like most movies abounds with anecdotes 
and tales both tall and true 
theres the story of the ragged coat frank morgan wore as 
professor marvel it was purportedly purchased from a secondhand 
store in los angeles and as the story goes morgan pulled out a 
pocket one day and found the name l frank baum sewn inside baum 
wrote the orginal oz stories 
or when dorothy first meets the lion and slaps him for growling 
at the tin man and scarecrow and the lion grabs his tail and 
cries garland burst into giggles on the set and delayed the shoot 
fleming as the legend goes took garland behind one of the trees 
and slapped her the scene was shot and the take was good 
later the director called the three vaudeville stars hams 
for dancing down the yellow brick road without little judy 
and the vaudeville in bert lahr allowed him to come up with the 
classic movie line unusual weather were having aint it 
when dorothy and friends wake up in the poppy field during a 
snowstorm 
ray bolger who played the scarecrow later said we joked a 
lot because that was the only way we could survive 
every film has someone whos responsible for continuity in 
oz that meant that every morning someone would count the straw 
sticking out of bolgers costume to make sure it was accurate in 
terms of what had already been shot 
costumes and makeup took their toll on bolger margaret hamilton 
the wicked witch bert lahr the lion and jack haley the tin 
woodman bolgers skin began to wrinkle because of the scarecrow 
makeup and mask haleys 40pound costume prevented him from 
sitting between takes hamilton had a green tint to her skin even 
when the movie was completed and her fake fingernails were always 
popping off 
because the movie used more lights and electricity than any 
other movie it was shot in technicolor the set was unreasonably 
hot sometimes it would even smoke up lahr whose costume was 
extremely heavy and snug was drenched in perspiration after 
minutes 
while stories about the the wizard of oz continue to 
delight the movie has grown from a childhood romp to the campy 
comebacks of a jaded generation memo and note pads abound with 
dorothys wideeyed proclamation to toto once theyve landed in oz 
i dont think were in kansas anymore toto 
and the wicked witch of the wests admonition to dorothy 
well my little pretty i can cause accidents too after 
dorothy says that dropping a house on the wicked witch of the east 
was an accident is now a popular oneliner 
but most of all the wizard of oz will always evoke happy 
thoughts of home as dorothy said if i ever go looking for my 
hearts desire again i wont look any further than my own back 
yard because if it isnt there i never really lost it to begin 
with

supermarket shoppers unsure what 
distinguishes lite bread from regular or highfiber cereals 
from others may be getting some help from the federal government 
both congress and the food and drug administration are 
considering massive revisions in the fdas nutrition labeling 
requirements which date from 1973 when the vitamin and mineral 
content of foods was consumers prime concern 
now much of the focus of healthy eating has shifted to foods 
cholesterol fat and fiber content areas untouched by the current 
regulations 
even the food industry until now a foe of compulsory labeling 
appears to be going along for a price 
says dr frank young the fda commissioner 
the public is demanding change in this area and deserves 
nothing less than our maximum efforts to accomplish this change 
young testifying before a congressional committee recently 
referred to the two biggest driving forces behind the heightened 
interest in nutrition the surgeon generals report on nutrition 
and health which cited dietary factors in five of the 10 leading 
causes of death including cardiovascular disease and cancer and 
the report by the national research council diet and health 
implications for reducing chronic disease risk 
the fda commissioner said both reports issued last year 
concluded that americans could substantially reduce their risk of 
heart disease cancer and many other chronic diseases through 
specific changes in eating habits 
a survey of shoppers taken this year for a food industry 
organization found that 94 percent of the polls participants are 
concerned about the nutritional content of what they eat 
thirtyeight percent said they were most concerned about 
cholestrol a 16point jump in just one year 
but the fda and members of congress disagree on how to give the 
public what it wants 
since 1973 when the fda imposed nutrition labeling requirements 
for the first time products to which nutrients have been added or 
for which a nutrition claim is made 
must be labeled with quantitative listings of calories 
carbohydrates and protein 
must show by average or usual serving the percentages 
of the federal governments recommended daily allowance of protein 
vitamin a vitamin c thiamine riboflavin niacin calcium and 
iron contained in a product 
must list calories protein content carbohydrates fat and 
sodium 
but those regulations were drawn up when vitamin and mineral 
content was the most prevalent consumer concern 
now what many shoppers want most is such information as a 
products fat and fiber content its liteness or lack thereof 
and how naturally it was made 
some in congress contend the fda has not moved quickly enough to 
address those concerns 
rep henry waxman dcalif and sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
have introduced the nutrition labeling and education act of 
1989 if passed by both houses the bills sponsors say revised 
labels could begin appearing within 18 months of being signed by 
the president 
twentythree groups including the american heart association 
and american cancer society have endorsed the bill 
the legislation would require that labels list the serving size 
and number of servings per container total calories and calories 
broken down by total and saturated fat also required would be 
amounts broken down by serving of total saturated and 
unsaturated fat cholesterol sodium complex carbohydrates 
protein dietary fiber and other nutrients 
the bill would also require that any health claims on labels 
that characterize the amount or relationship of calories fat 
cholesterol sodium carbohydrates sugar protein or dietary fiber 
to a disease or condition use terms defined by the secretary of 
health and human services and that the definitions be supported by 
a scientific consensus 
another bill introduced by sen orrin hatch rutah is similar 
to the waxmanmetzenbaum bill except that it would preclude state 
labeling regulations 
perceptions of the two proposals vary predictably 
the fda says congressional action isnt necessary that it can 
meet shoppers needs without legislation the grocery industry 
supports the hatch bill activist consumer groups say any 
legislation that is adopted will need to address a variety of 
nutrition issues not now covered 
for its part the fda plans to hold five hearings around the 
country to ask people how they would like to see the current 
regulations changed 
for instance the agency wants to know how much interest there 
is in writing definitions for commonly used terms such as low 
salt or reduced fat whether there should be requirements 
manufacturers must meet in claiming their products help prevent 
disease if minimum standards are needed to identify certain foods 
and whether the public is willing to pay the added costs that would 
likely accompany new labeling requirements 
from the comments at those hearings which havent been set the 
fda says it will revise its regulations and that the process should 
be finished early in 1990 
the agencys intent is to convince congress it need not set the 
fdas standards or at least to have revised regulations ready if 
capitol hill orders the agency to change its act 
young told congress 
it is unclear whether legislation is necessary to achieve most 
or all of our shared goals i believe many if not all of the 
changes contemplated can be made administratively 
the food industrys primary hope appears to be getting federal 
legislation that eliminates state regulation 
says jeff nedelman a vice president of the grocery 
manufacturers of america 
we would support a comprehensive reform of the dietary and 
health informaton that is provided to consumers if we can come out 
of this process with national standards 
seeking to avoid potentially 50 different state standards the 
national food processors association says regulations appropriate 
for portland maine are equally applicable to portland ore 
but some consumer groups say states should still have the 
prerogative to toughen federal standards and note that california 
and new york for instance have often taken the lead in nutrition 
issues 
whatever the new regulations are these activists say they need 
to reflect a range of specific consumer interests not now addressed 
in the fda requirements 
one group in the forefront of the movement to toughen labeling 
requirements the center for science in the public interest says 
the regulations should 
eliminate or supplement the description of quantities as 
measured in grams a metric term unless accompanied by defined 
terms such as high low or medium 
eliminate thiamin riboflavin and niacin from labels since 
deficiencies in those elements are no longer a significant health 
threat 
list amounts of fat cholesterol cholesterolraising or 
saturated fats sodium starch dietary fiber and sugar 
consider a diagram giving percentages of protein sugar 
complex carbohydrates total fat and saturated fat 
list the percentage of a products major ingredients such as 
sugar and flour

ruined medieval fortresses stand 
silhouetted against the sky on scorched mountaintops across soviet 
georgia and atop each one flies a flag of the georgian independence 
movement 
the flags fly as well on police outposts and are sold at tbilisi 
newsstands in the form of lapel pins and dashboard suction cups 
one hangs over a highway from a peasants plot 
this land of glaciered crags fruitfilled valleys and black sea 
beaches is seething with resentment against the invaders from 
russia who took over their infant republic in 1921 
since troops armed with sharp shovels and toxic gas clashed with 
proindependence protesters in this capital april 9 killing 19 of 
them sympathy has grown for those georgians who want to secede 
from the soviet union 
but the soviet socialist republic of georgia a kingdom on its 
own in the middle ages also is rent by ethnic violence much of 
it pitting christian georgians against moslem minorities 
it is an explosive combination on the heels of april 9 
this is the last thing georgia needs right now says gizo 
grzeledze an official in the georgian foreign ministry it will 
bring the troops back 
the ethnic violence is spawned in part by reaction to the 
georgians rising nationalism 
hatreds and resentments dating back to the medieval times have 
reappeared among the dozen nationalities in the republic which is 
about half the size of arkansas 
conflicts pitting georgians against moslem abkhazians and 
azerbaijanis have cost 26 lives and injured more than 450 in 
several areas of georgia since the summer began georgians in the 
meskhetian area guard their homes against ethnic turks living there 
at the same time independence activists persuaded tens of 
thousands of workers to walk off their jobs in a general strike 
crippling transport and even a military jet factory 
thousands more have gathered in daily illegal meetings in 
downtown tbilisi 
even officials in the government ministry across the street from 
the gathering were hanging out their windows one recent day to 
listen to activist sviad gamsachurdia who said that in 1976 he 
could count just 20 or 30 people willing to join his call for 
independence 
in a tbilisi suburb vandals smashed the face and tore the head 
off a statue of vladimir i lenin the revered founder of the 
soviet union while a statue of the dictator josef v stalin a 
georgian stands unscathed 
the combustible mixture of nationalist unrest and ethnic 
violence is risky not only for georgia but also the rest of the 
country said shalva shanidze communist party leader of the 
akhaltsike region in the meskhetian area 
by strengthening the hardliners he maintained the activists 
are endangering all of the soviet union and its moves toward 
democracy and economic autonomy more than 100 ethnic groups live 
in the 15 soviet republics 
but gamsachurdia a greyhaired veteran of georgias resistance 
to soviet power says he is concerned only with the fate of 
georgia not the soviet union the fate of georgia he maintains 
is threatened by what he sees as islamic fundamentalism spilling 
over the border from iran 
it is a measure of the georgian publics sharing in 
gamsachurdias belief that the question activists and georgian 
communist officials alike pose to a visitor is not whether the 
united states would help georgia break from moscow but whether it 
would help an independent christian georgia against islamic 
fundamentalist iran 
the independence demonstrations of april have turned into 
demonstrations involving ethnic differences and religious 
backgrounds 
the christian orthodox church remains deeply rooted among 
georgians and still commands respect although the soviet 
government fosters atheism a number of very old churches have been 
preserved in georgia 
conflict between christians and moslems goes back centuries in 
the soviet caucasus region particularly in georgia and neighboring 
soviet armenia 
thousands of georgians filled rustaveli ave in tbilisi daily 
demonstrations during recent ethnic rioting between georgians and 
moslems in the abkhazian region a black sea resort area 
commanders of the 4500 soviet troops sent to quell the rioting 
said there were attempts to provoke the troops into firing on the 
population in what would have been a horrifying repeat of april 9 
in tblisi 
a letter from the georgian national front to the united nations 
in new york charged that the violence in abkhazia was organized by 
moscow it asked for un troops because it claimed soviet troops 
were protecting only abkhazians not georgians 
col gen yuri shatalin of the soviet army said his troops 
confiscated thousands of weapons from both georgians and 
abkhazians including explosives and machine guns 
lovard tukhashvili of the georgian institute of history 
archeology and ethnography said he believes the rioting was 
instigated by abkhazians who stand to lose their privileges to 
gorbachevs reforms or to an independent georgia 
abkhazians number 80000 just 17 percent of the abkhazian 
autonomous republics population and 15 percent of georgias 53 
million people but they dominate the power structure and 
managerial jobs in their region tukhashvili said 
the abkhazians contend however they are struggling for equal 
rights and feel they will achieve them only by seceding from 
georgia and becoming a 16th republic of the soviet union according 
to abkhazian legislator vladislav ardzinba 
minorities in georgia are reacting to growing georgian 
nationalism inextricably woven into the independence movement 
ardzinba said 
but georgians tell outsiders that this is georgian land 
abkhazians azerbaijanis and meskhetian turks make equally detailed 
claims to the contrary 
georgia was a kingdom from the 4th century bc to the 14th 
century ad in 1555 western georgia fell to turkey and eastern 
georgia to persia now iran it became part of the russian empire 
in 1783 and had a spell of independence in 191821 after the 
bolsheviks seized power in moscow 
because georgians resisted the new soviet power a quarter of 
their land was turned over to other ethnic groups 
tukhashvili the historian said stalin did his fellow georgians 
no favors when he had whole nationalities deported from traditional 
homelands to central asia 
for example he said the georgians who moved onto the lands of 
the deported meskhetian turks now face nearly 400000 meskhetians 
clamoring to return and reclaim their homes 
for grzeledze of the georgian foreign ministry it is no 
coincidence that the azerbaijanis turks and most of the abkhazians 
are moslems traditional enemies of christian georgia 
georgia voluntarily joined the russian empire because it was the 
only christian alternative to domination by turks and persians 
nearly two centuries have passed but the geography hasnt 
changed 
persia is now revolutionary iran under the rule of moslem 
mullahs dedicated to spreading islamic fundamentalism and the high 
birth rates of moslems have the georgians fearful of becoming 
minorities in their own land

col moammar gadhafi is giving his 
revolution a facelift repainting the weathered look of the radical 
arab nation that has not aged gracefully 
the revolution turns 20 on sept 1 and the colonel at a cost 
estimated to total hundreds of millions of dollars is preparing an 
anniversary bash in a remodeled capital 
however western diplomats say the fresh paint cant hide all 
the cracks in gadhafis libya they said violent unrest in the 
military around benghazi in january killed an unknown number of 
people and injured more than 100 
moslem fundamentalists demonstrated against gadhafi in tripoli 
also in january and some were sent to jail the diplomats estimate 
gadhafis prisons now hold 2000 to 6000 people perhaps more 
than when he bulldozed down the prison gates in march of 1988 in a 
general amnesty 
oil profits are diminishing and some fields could dry up in 10 
years diplomats conservatively estimate libya earns 5 billion a 
year and spends 7 billion to 8 billion 
the 3yearold us embargo on dealings with libya imposed by 
president ronald reagan and recently renewed by president bush is 
hurting if libya doesnt gain access to american spare parts soon 
experts say many of the oil plants will have to be replaced 
entirely 
still two decades after he seized power from king idris 
gadhafi remains solidly in control said the diplomats who all 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he is very strong a european ambassador said that is why 
he is having the 20th anniversary there is no one to replace him 
and he sees to that he will not let anyone else have enough power 
to become a threat 
as sept 1 approaches the cleanup continues around the clock 
thousands of workers are repaving tripolis old streets and 
building new ones a luxury hotel and new office towers rise along 
the waterfront scores of new mosques and apartment buildings are 
under construction 
everywhere painters are covering the dirty brown face of tripoli 
with fresh coats of white paint trimmed with green the color of 
gadhafis revolution 
behind the whitewash and beyond the smooth new roads are grim 
rundown apartments on littered streets the shops and apartments 
in the narrow alleys of the arab market and the old quarter are 
filthy and rat infested trash and garbage are crammed into 
alcoves beneath stairs and piled high in vacant lots 
there is no open government in libya and changes are hard to 
quantify requests for interviews with gadhafi or the heads of 
libyan ministries went unanswered many of the officials were in 
sirte a coastal city 155 miles southeast of tripoli where gadhafi 
reportedly is building a new capital 
diplomats say the military presence appears reduced in recent 
months and troops no longer patrol the airport 
but surfacetoair missile batteries and radar stations still 
are seen in tripoli antiaircraft guns jut above the now gleaming 
white walls of gadhafis fortified compound 
the weapons are a reminder of the us air raids on tripoli and 
benghazi in april 1986 ordered by president reagan in retaliation 
for the terrorist bombing of a disco in west berlin that killed an 
american serviceman and a turkish woman 
during the last year western diplomats said gadhafi has sought 
to reduce tensions with the west mend fences with the arab world 
and loosen his stranglehold on libyan commerce 
he has restored ties with egypt and opened oil negotiations with 
the americans for the possible return of us oil companies to 
libya hinting he is also ready to improve relations american oil 
companies had oil concessions in libya worth an estimated 3 
billion when reagan ordered the embargo on feb 1 1986 oil 
companies were given until june 30 1986 to comply reagans order 
banned americans from visiting or working in libya 
us relations with libya have been sour almost since he seized 
power the us wheelus air base in libya was evacuated in june 
1970 and the us ambassador was recalled in 1973 the us 
embassy was sacked dec 2 1979 by radicals in support of the 
iranian revolution and the last two american diplomats were 
removed in may 1980 in may 1981 the united states closed the 
libyan mission in washington us interests are currently 
represented by the belgian embassy 
reagan ordered the embargo in 1986 because of terrorists attacks 
at the rome and vienna airports in december 1985 the united states 
blamed palestinian terrorist abu nidal for the attacks and accused 
ghadhafi of harboring him

the western diplomats some citing palestinian sources say 
there are reports that gadhafi has stopped giving money to terror 
groups such as abu nidals most likely because of their ties to 
moslem fundamentalism 
but the diplomats add that there are other unconfirmed reports 
that guerrilla training bases still operate in the libyan desert 
the diplomats say they have heard reports that the alleged 
chemical weapons plant at rabta 60 miles southwest of tripoli has 
been dismantled but they caution it could be rebuilt later 
last december president reagan said he could not rule out a 
military strike to destroy the plant that gadhafi insisted was 
designed to manufacture pharmaceuticals the tensions over the 
plant escalated in january when us warplanes shot down two libyan 
migs in the mediterranean 
some libyans insist their life has improved during the 20 years 
of gadhafis rule 
before the people didnt have houses there were no schools 
no streets said one now the people have houses schools and 
streets 
the western diplomats said over the years gadhafi has squandered 
billions on arms military adventure and prestige projects 
the most obvious changes are in the shops gadhafis socialist 
policies had forced most shops to close years ago leading to 
shortages and blackmarket prices the colonel had all but stopped 
imports of consumer goods allowing only a few to be sold through 
giant state companies in 1985 he expelled thousands of foreign 
workers while at the same time his revolutionary system forbade 
libyans from working for other libyans under most circumstances 
last year gadhafi began allowing small businesses to import 
some goods for sale 
now about twothirds of the shops in the arab market and central 
tripoli are open the shelves are stocked with household goods 
jewelry and cheaply made clothes from malta tunisia yugolavia 
romania and italy 
barefoot weavers toil at ancient looms in the old quarter while 
other craftsmen etch designs in decorative copper or brass plates 
private fruit vegetable and meat stores are open all over the 
city but the shelves are still barren in the vast 
governmentowned peoples markets which are combination department 
stores and supermarkets 
at noon one recent day the food shelves on one peoples market 
store had only bottled fruit drinks canned fish processed cheese 
from holland tea from china jars of honey cans of condensed 
milk turkish detergent and large burlap sacks of sugar 
diplomats said the new openness led to price gouging that 
prompted the government to close some shops 
near sabatrah 50 miles west of tripoli scores of shops and 
storefronts have been reduced to rubble by government bulldozers 
you see it everywhere one diplomat said the official 
reason is that the shops were illegal they did not have the proper 
licenses and building permits 
but a young libyan businessman said i think this is a good 
idea because it will teach respect for the law 
gadhafis policies make it difficult but not impossible to 
have a successful business said the businessman who used his own 
money to start a restaurant and two wholesale food supply 
businesses 
still he acknowledges that for most people without their own 
money there is a sense of hopelessness 
my dream said a young government employee is to go to 
america

sen claiborne pell chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee is acting like a man who doesnt want 
to be a senator for six more years 
while other senators up for reelection next year have already 
raised hundreds of thousands and in some cases several million 
dollars pells fundraising activities have been moribund 
the 31 senators who have established campaign committees for a 
1990 reelection bid raised an average of nearly 750000 each 
during the first six months of this year 
but according to campaign disclosure reports filed at the 
federal election commission pell received just a single 5000 
contribution during the same period 
the numbers are more curious considering the 70yearold 
democrat is likely to face his toughest race in 18 years 
since his hardfought 1972 victory over republican john h 
chafee who went on to win the states other senate seat four years 
later pell has won reelections in 1978 and 1984 by 3to1 margins 
against weak republican opponents 
but next year pell likely would face claudine schneider an 
ambitious and popular fiveterm congresswoman 
miss schneider who has allbutannounced a senate run reported 
more than 200000 in campaign contributions to her house 
reelection committee for the januaryjune fec reporting period 
she raised only onefifth that amount during the corresponding 
period two years ago 
when he knows he could face someone as aggressive as claudine 
schneider i dont see how he can afford to take that passive 
attitude said wendy democher a spokeswoman for the national 
republican senatorial committee 
pell aides say the senators lack of fund raising is not a sign 
that he is waffling on whether to run but an outgrowth of his 
concerns that the campaign season has become too long 
he has said repeatedly he has every intention of running 
said a senior pell aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
he just feels very strongly that the campaign process has gotten 
out of hand 
hes just practicing what he preaches said anita dunn a 
spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
pell however apparently did not feel that way in previous 
elections in the first six months of 1983 the year before his 
last campaign the senator raised nearly 100000 in preparation 
for a campaign that was considered laughably easy 
pell does have 444686 in his campaign coffers in preparation 
for 1990 but 21 of the 30 other senators running next year have 
more according to newly filed fec documents 
national gop campaign strategists who have virtually ignored 
pell in past races have targeted the senator as one of the six 
incumbent democrats they will aggressively try to push out of the 
senate next year 
pell is one of the most popular politicians in rhode island 
history winning his senate seat in 1960 by defeating two former 
governors in a primary and going on to win in 1966 1972 1978 and 
1984 
he has been a leading advocate for the arts and education and 
in 1986 he rose to chairman of the powerful senate foreign 
relations committee 
but chairmen of that committee have in the past suffered at 
reelection time attacked by challengers who charge that they are 
paying too much attention to international problems and not enough 
to parochial concerns five years ago democrat paul simon 
successfully challenged thenforeign relations chairman charles 
percy rill 
pell is vulnerable in other areas not least of which is his 
preoccupation with psychic powers 
miss schneider could be a formiddable candidate 
she has broad statewide recognition since rhode island has only 
two house seats and she is just the type of republican that 
democratdominated rhode island likes a liberal on social issues 
with a strong environmental record she came to congress by the 
rarest of routes defeating a democratic incumbent and has won 
reelection by pelllike margins ever since 
the change of administrations at the white house also will help 
the congresswoman while it is questionable how much support she 
would have received from conservatives running the party in the 
reagan years miss schneider already has had first lady barbara 
bush featured at a lucrative fundraiser 
age also could become a major factor in the race 
miss schneider is 42 the same age pell was when he first came 
to the senate nearly 30 years ago 
pell will be 71 in november and would be 78 at the end of 
another sixyear term 
pell however would still be a youngster compared to his 
predecessor theodore green came to the senate at age 69 and 
retired in 1960 at age 93

although few in number south korean 
feminists have mounted an attack on a deeply rooted culture that 
encourages women to be dutiful and subservient to their fathers 
husbands and sons 
the movement has yet to take hold on a broad scale and a major 
effort still looms ahead but the feminists say south korea no 
longer can afford to treat its women as servants and sexual objects 
they maintain the nations remarkable economic growth owes much 
to womens labors and that the transition from authoritarian to 
democratic government will not be complete until womens rights are 
assured 
demand your equal rights reads a headline in the 
50000circulation womens news a weekly 
yet cabarets barber shops and bars still provide sexual 
services to men and authorities say hundreds possibly thousands 
of young women are kidnapped each year or forced into prostitution 
in companies many male managers make no secret of passing over 
women for promotions some companies fire women who marry and as 
recently as a year ago banks rarely allowed pregnant women to serve 
the public 
when 14 women were appointed last year to head womens 
provincial programs the government called the move a major step 
forward but one appointee said she was shown to her new office 
across from the toilet and another contended the government 
lumped women old people and children together in order to 
dispose of us easily 
women comprise up to 50 percent of the work force and many 
thousands of south korean women have college educations yet they 
still receive half the wages of men are denied promotions and 
often are discriminated against in th courts 
men are afraid if we have our own identity our own career 
our own viewpoints that they are losing something says the only 
woman in president roh taewoos cabinet kim yungchung 
the challenges are formidable and require a change of attitude 
in both sexes as well as enforcement of laws says chung ilsook 
president of ewha the nations oldest and largest school for 
women a catalyst in the womens movement she says change though 
painfully slow is inevitable 
korean feminists concede their movement faces an uphill 
struggle in a nation of 42 million people only a few thousand are 
actively lobbying for womens rights 
advocates hope however that the establishment of local 
assemblies in 1990 will be a turning point to lure women into 
politics and they see potential allies in more than 2500 womens 
organizations around the country 
paek youngok an ewha professor says korean women need to be 
given the opportunity to participate in the political process to 
ensure that women play a permanent and farreaching role in 
government and laws affecting their lives 
fully onehalf of the entire adult population have been all 
but invisible in political terms she says paek blames this on 
sexrole conceptions and the limitations of political opportunity 
a 1988 equal employment act guarantees employment opportunities 
for women and the employment security act calls for increasing the 
options for womens work but feminists say that without 
enforcement the words are window dressing 
the provisions are perfect said kim the cabinet member who 
oversees policy for women but our job is to narrow the gap 
between legal provisions and practices to fully implement the 
provisions 
the first woman to run for president hong sukja became so 
exasperated that she told a news conference two years ago i am 
prepared to do everything humanly possible but strip tease to help 
emancipate korean women 
in nearby japan a record 22 women were elected recently to the 
upper house of parliament an event cheered by korean feminists 
who failed to elect one woman to the last national assembly in 
seoul 
networking among korean professional women has taken root with 
breakfast and luncheon clubs women can attend training courses to 
prepare for politics or business and telephone hotline numbers are 
available for women in need concerts of women composers and 
womens cinema festivals now are being held 
yet many women show no sign of joining the struggle its common 
for a wife to stay in the kitchen when a family entertains or if 
shes at the table not to speak in deference to her husband even 
radical students demanding sweeping change ignore womens rights 
and treat women as cheerleaders instead of policy makers 
some say im a feminist president roh said at a news 
conference i got a lot of votes from women in my last election 
but his wife kim oksook remains dutifully in his shadow 
usually appearing in public walking behind him and rarely speaking 
to the press

the head of the leading opposition party kim daejung came 
under attack after his wife lee heeho gave speeches in the last 
presidential campaign 
democracy begins at home she said one speech urging south 
koreans not to discriminate between male and female children 
a door plaque at kims residence lists his wifes name alongside 
his a rarity and a source of disdain among some of their neighbors 
surveys indicate that despite growing sensitivity to womens 
expanding roles in society both sexes expect women to remain 
subservient and both consider lower wages for women natural 
the government says 45 to 50 percent of the 20 millionmember 
work force are women half in unskilled or semiskilled 
manufacturing and assemblyline jobs 
feminists charge that women face discrimination at every level 
they note that only nine of the countrys 1798 lawyers and 24 of 
the 1008 judges are women 
the governmentrun korean womens development institute 
established in 1983 says the deeply rooted maleoriented 
mentality of korean culture has led to most women feeling inferior 
to men an attitude it says prolongs discrimination 
acceptance of womens secondclass role is linked to the 
500yearold teachings of confucius who stressed the role of men 
and felt that the womans place was to serve to obey her husband 
and bear him a son 
women are never to ask questions but are supposed to do what 
men tell them says a businesswoman women are losing patience 
and the younger the woman the less patience she has 
traditionally korean women were identified not by name but by a 
reference relative to the men in their lives 
they were known as soandsos daughter soandsos wife and in 
old age soandsos mother so few people knew their mothers 
given name that after the 195053 korean war divided the peninsula 
officials had difficulty uniting families 
the culture is changing said ewhas dr chung to 
democratize south korea and continue its economic growth she said 
the nation needs to mobilize its full human resources why should 
women be restricted 
demands of womens groups include changing family law in which 
males benefit more than females in marriage divorce and 
inheritance 
if women of advanced training and high caliber are to be 
excluded from our social system for no other reason than that they 
are not men it will be a great loss and a waste of valuable 
resources said a recent editorial in the korea herald 
women labor union leaders say impoverished factory workers are 
joining educated women in demanding change male managers complain 
as one put it that women who once kept their mouths shut now 
scream about hours and wages 
union activist lee kyongja has a college degree and worked 20 
years for the korea development bank her efforts to unionize women 
at the bank resulted in demotion a 14day hunger strike and 
dismissal before she was reinstated as a union chief 
women should learn to complain negotiate and fight no 
matter how much time and pain it may take because its a long way 
that we have to go she said 
education is the real hope for womens rights says chang 
pilwha head of ewhas 12yearold womens studies department the 
first established in asia some 2000 of ewhas 17000 students 
take courses each semester in womens issues 
people must recognize women as social beings said yoon 
seonyoung a college junior we cannot be discriminated against 
any longer

with a 280 million hostile offer for 
americas no 2 glass maker a leading mexican manufacturer hopes 
to challenge the plastic paper and other container materials that 
have hurt the us glass business 
in what is believed to be the first hostile takeover bid by a 
mexican company vitro sa this week announced a 20ashare 
takeover offer for struggling anchor glass container corp of 
tampa fla 
ulrich sander director of corporate communications for vitro 
said vitros plans would help strengthen the glass part of the 
packaging industry in the united states 
vitro wants to bring stateoftheart technology to anchor 
glass to make it more competitive and to regain sales lost to 
paper metal and plastic containers he said 
like other us glasscontainer makers anchor has struggled as 
plastic and aluminum have displaced glass as the packaging material 
of choice in many industries in the 1980s 
new technology has helped glass makers boost production lately

mexico has changed its strict laws regulating 
foreign investment in a bid to attract outside investors to its 
tourism industry a mexican government official says 
tourism is mexicos secondlargest source of foreign exchange 
after oil and has been identified by the government as the most 
promising sector for growth 
ezequiel padilla mexicos undersecretary of tourism said 
foreign companies in the past needed permission from a mexican 
government agency before they were allowed to invest in the 
country often with long delays 
now under the 8monthold administration of president carlos 
salinas de gortari that process is no longer required he said 
this is a dramatic change from before padilla said in an 
interview thursday in new york 
in addition foreign investors now can increase holdings in a 
mexican company to a majority stake and profits can be repatriated 
abroad 
mexico recently reached an agreement with lenders to reduce its 
54 billion debt to commercial banks the accord is aimed at giving 
mexico 3 billion a year for capital investment 
payments on the countrys 107 billion foreign debt have 
contributed to a sharp decline in living standards over the past 
seven years 
efforts to encourage foreign investment and lower trade barriers 
are considered an integral part of mexicans new economic plan 
as an example of recent foreign investment padilla cited a 400 
million joint venture between cemex a large mexican cement 
company and us hotel giant marriott corp to develop resorts in 
five different areas in the next four years 
another big us hotel chain hyatt corp is involved in a 
similar venture padilla said 
he said the mexican government will play a very strategic 
catalytical role in tourism development by promoting projects and 
selling land to investors with plans to develop five tourist 
resorts in cancun ixtapa los cabos loreto and bahias de huatulco 
mexico now earns around 25 billion a year from tourism which 
the government hopes to double to 5 billion by 1994 plans call 
for construction of 50000 hotel rooms requiring an investment of 
about 4 billion 
about 2 billion of that will come from foreign companies 
including around 1 billion from us sources padilla said the 
new tourism program is expected to create around 1 million jobs in 
mexico where one out of every seven people is employed in that 
industry 
some 85 percent of the foreign tourists who visit mexico are 
from the united states each spending an average 500 per week in 
the country

despite political turmoil japan inc is going full 
steam ahead 
the governing party this week installed its third prime minister 
in three months after its worst election defeat in decades but 
japans economy is booming and corporate profits are reaching new 
highs 
japanese business leaders who are pouring more investment into 
factories at home and abroad welcomed the new prime minister 
toshiki kaifu as they did the last one just 69 days earlier 
we hope he will carry out the political reforms which people 
are expecting said steel magnate eishiro saito head of japans 
biggest association of industrialists 
local media for months have criticized the sex and money 
scandals of the conservative liberal democratic party as politics 
unworthy of a great economic power 
but some observers say the contrast between japans lean mean 
private enterprises and its swampy politics shows that the country 
can run itself well despite a vacuum in political leadership 
the impact of recent political problems on the economy has 
been quite small said hiroshi uchida senior analyst at first 
boston japan ltd in this country economic fundamentals are 
much more important than who becomes prime minister 
in an editorial today the japan times dismissed the ldps 
recent internal turmoil as a sort of tempest in a teacup or a 
political burlesque 
for more than three decades the conservative liberal democratic 
party has been the faithful partner of the bureaucracy and of big 
business in creating japans famed economic growth and social and 
political stability 
the bureaucracy gave the system brains business provided the 
brawn and the ldp contributed consensusbuilding and political 
legitimacy 
an influencepeddling scandal growing out of those close ties 
has seriously damaged the ldp and virtually paralyzed parliament 
for more than a year but the private sector is charging ahead with 
new investment economic coordination at the bureaucratic level 
proceeds largely as usual 
analysts said that isnt surprising because in japan career 
bureaucrats not politicians draft most laws and develop and 
implement policies 
also huge companies like toyota are so rich they dont even 
need bank loans analysts said and have long outgrown a need to 
rely on the government 
many japanese businessmen dont even seem to fear the prospect 
of a socialist government which could emerge through a coalition 
government after lower house elections due by next summer some 
even said it would teach the ldp a useful lesson 
i dont get a sense of high anxiety about a socialist 
government said japanese business expert james abegglen nothing 
they put forward is particularly alarming 
you have to remember the socialist party of japan is to the 
right of many rightwing parties in other countries said chris 
russell head of equity analysis at jardine fleming securities 
japan the policies of a socialist government wouldnt be that 
dramatically different from the ldp 
the socialists dont advocate nationalizing industries or 
sweeping redistribution of income and would have trouble moving 
the entrenched bureaucracy toward radical change even if they 
wanted to he said 
there are some concerns a victory by the protectionminded 
socialists could worsen trade friction with the united states and 
political uncertainty has dampened stock market activity for months 
but the stock market surprised analysts by jumping up not down 
after each major setback for the probusiness liberal democratic 
party 
when noboru takeshita resigned in disgrace and when a major 
parliamentary defeat forced his successor sousuke uno to step down 
in rapid succession the market shot up 
market analysts say investors were relieved of uncertainty and 
reassured that business could go on as usual when it comes to the 
stock market russell said politics is a nonissue

master takeover engineer sir james goldsmith 
is charging that congressional concern over his hostile bid for bat 
industries plc has been whipped up by a powerful multinational 
tobacco conglomerate 
on thursday it was disclosed that 209 members of the house and 
senate had written secretary of state james a baker iii asking him 
to express their concern to the british government about the 216 
billion leveraged buyout 
state department officials on two occasions have conveyed 
concern to the british embassy in washington about the potential 
impact of the takeover the new york times reported in todays 
editions 
responding to the congressmens letter goldsmith said in a 
statement had any of them checked they would have easily 
ascertained that the socalled facts alluded to in the letter are 
innaccurate and misleading 
last month the anglofrench financier combined with british 
merchant banker jacob rothschild and australian investor kerry 
packer to make an offer for bat 
the cashless offer by hoylake investments ltd would be financed 
mostly with borrowed money 
bat the worlds largest tobacco company also has significant 
interests in financial services paper and retailing including 
such us holdings as the saks fifth avenue and marshall field 
department stores and farmers insurance group 
this proposed deal looks like takeover mania at its worst 
said sen wendell ford dky whose office released the letter to 
baker along with sen mitch mcconnell rky 
but goldsmith who has made millions taking over companies and 
then selling off their pieces said the congressmen didnt have 
their facts straight 
i am shocked that 200 people would sign a letter attacking us 
without a single one of those people checking with us as to its 
accuracy or validity said goldsmith in the statement issued in 
new york 
i can only conclude that this is the result of an intensive 
lobbying campaign by a powerful multinational tobacco 
conglomerate he added without elaborating 
londonbased bat once was known as british american tobacco 
tobacco brands overseen by bats us subsidiary louisville 
kybased batus inc include benson and hedges and kool batus 
maintains factories stores or offices in 40 states 
the letter to baker said the congressmen were deeply 
concerned about the bid which they said would eventually 
dismantle a company that is important to hundreds of us 
communities 
but goldsmith countered our history of acquisitions in the 
united states demonstrates that this has resulted in jobcreation 
and not job loss 
the offer makes clear that steps have been taken adequately to 
protect us interests be it those of employees creditors or 
policyholders said the statement 
the two kentucky senators ford and mcconnell wrote the letter 
on the senate side its authors in the house were reps vic fazio 
dcalif michael g oxley rohio lindsay thomas dga and jim 
bunning rky 
we want you to communicate our concerns to the british 
government and we request that you advise us of the steps being 
undertaken by the us government to adress the profound policy 
implications raised by this egregious deal the letter said 
the congressionl letter said bats us subsidiary its 55000 
employees and millions of insurance policy holders are being put at 
considerable risk in a deal that will personally net goldsmith 
rothschild packer and their advisers over 5 billion 
ford said the offer may be structured to avoid potential 
jurisdiction of the us securities and exchange commission and 
deny american shareholders a voice in the deal 
previously ford asked the general accounting office to 
investigate the potential effects and implications of the bat offer 
on us investors and capital markets and also analyze whether it 
would be appropriate for the sec to assert jurisdiction 
several other congressmen have asked sec chairman david ruder to 
study the proposed takeover

theres no evidence to warrant grounding 
dc10s despite two explosive engine failures within a month the 
nations top aviation official says 
its safe to fly i would fly in the aircraft today federal 
aviation administrator james b busey said thursday less than 24 
hours after a northwest airlines dc10 made a safe emergency 
landing in denver with holes blasted in the housing of its 
tailmounted engine 
for the second time in his first six weeks on the job busey 
defended the mcdonnell douglasbuilt dc10 a workhorse jumbo jet 
for about 50 airlines around the world 
three weeks ago another explosive engine failure caused a 
united airlines dc10 to crashland in sioux city iowa killing 
111 people 
we know of no hard facts that would lead us to take action to 
ground the dc10 busey said when asked about its safety 
he declined to draw comparisons between the sioux city and 
denver incidents saying any decision to ground a class of 
airliners would be made only after careful investigation and 
deliberation 
to act speculatively or on the basis of incomplete information 
in my judgment would be irresponsible he said 
the united plane carried general electric engines while the 
northwest plane had pratt and whitney engines 
american continental delta eastern northwest pan american 
and united airlines fly a total of 166 dc10s and about 300 more 
are flown by nonus airlines 
after buseys statements the international airline passengers 
association renewed its call for grounding the dc10 saying its 
the only way to protect the public while finding out whats wrong 
with the aircraft 
busey said the faa was prepared to take any action that might be 
indicated by facts uncovered in the national transportation safety 
board investigation of the denver incident and the iowa crash 
investigators said the united jetliners rear engine apparently 
disintegrated in flight knocking out critical hydraulic flight 
controls that meet in the planes tail section the northwest 
planes controls were not affected 
all dc10s were grounded for a month in 1979 after an american 
airlines plane lost a wing engine severing hydraulic lines as the 
plane was taking off from chicago investigators later blamed the 
crash on faulty maintenance a total of 273 people died including 
all 271 on board the plane and two on the ground 
the ntsb dispatched a full team to denver because of apparent 
similarities with the sioux city crash ordinarily nonfatal 
accidents are handled by ntsb field investigators 
both mishaps involved an uncontained engine failure in 
which engine pieces fly out through the engine casing 
meanwhile a task force formed by busey last month after the 
sioux city crash to examine possible changes in the design of 
widebody planes met for the first time thursday 
the faa said the task force would compare construction of the 
four widebody planes the dc10 the 747 the l1011 and the 
europeanmade airbus to determine whether hydraulic systems can 
be better protected from engine failures hydraulic lines control 
the wing and tail mechanisms that steer planes 
busey declined to say how long it would take for any changes to 
be made but said he wanted the task force to complete its work and 
make recommendations as quickly as possible 
on other aviation issues busey said 
a device capable of detecting plastic explosives in luggage is 
expected to be in operation at new yorks john f kennedy 
international airport next month with others to be installed in 
london frankfurt west germany miami and san francisco within a 
few months 
reports of near midair collisions defined by the faa as a 
separation of less than 500 feet between planes when there is a 
danger of collision received from pilots of all types of planes 
totaled 280 for the first six months of 1989 down 25 percent from 
the same period last year there were seven collisions from january 
through june compared with 12 a year ago 
air traffic controller errors and pilot deviations are down 
this year busey credited improved educational regulatory and 
enforcement measures controller errors he said fell 8 percent 
from 509 to 469 while pilot deviations declined 30 percent from 
1580 to 1104

lj hooker corps reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy laws and an influx of credit should keep the companys 
stores stocked and projects afloat the new manager of the company 
says 
officials of general electric capital corp said thursday a 
proposed 50 million debtorinpossession credit line was 
intended to help hooker get back on its feet the proposal is 
subject to approval by the us bankruptcy court 
lj hooker the atlantabased us subsidiary of australias 
hooker corp filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code in new york on wednesday 
the borrowing under ge capitals proposed line of credit is to 
be secured by certain assets of lj hooker including inventories 
of the bonwit teller and b altman amp co store chains said jeffery 
h coates senior vice president of ge capitals corporate 
finance group 
meanwhile vendors reportedly are balking at selling merchandise 
to bonwit teller and altmans due to the parent companys financial 
difficulties 
the wall street journal reported today that several vendors have 
said they will sell merchandise only on a cash basis to the two 
department store chains 
sanford c sigoloff a turnaround expert who has been hired by 
lj hooker to manage the company during reorganization told the 
journal that the reaction of vendors isnt surprising 
theres nothing strange about the vendor reaction because 
this company hasnt been the best corporate citizen in terms of 
payment he said our job is to essentially work with the 
trade give them cash before delivery and then develop a 
relationship that allows them to give us trade credit 
coates said the presence of sigoloff played a role in the 
decision by ge capital to extend the credit line ge capital is a 
subsidiary of general electric co 
it is a time to take the pressure out of the pressure 
cooker sigoloff said in an interview with the atlanta 
journalconstitution we have to jumpstart this company which 
has been starved for cash now the test is who gets the cash and 
how much 
he said the priority would be to lj hookers customers 
those who have bought lj hooker homes and who shop in the 
companys department stores we are going to clean the slate and 
get going again he said 
sigoloff who will meet with hooker creditors later this month 
has rehabilitated several financially troubled companies including 
wickes companies inc a californiabased retailer that also was in 
chapter 11 
while some of lj hookers holdings were not included in the 
bankruptcy filing analysts said that might be because they already 
are in negotiations with potential purchasers 
anthony mclellan a former president of lj hooker who is 
trying to purchase the lj hooker homes division said i 
understand that sigoloff is interested in disposing of the 
assets 
i expect hell be interested in meeting people who are 
interested buying said mclellan 
meanwhile thursday the anchor store of thornton town center an 
lj hooker mall development in denver said it would open as 
scheduled next month despite the companys financial problems 
in denver biggs called colorados first hypermarket 
announced its scheduled sept 20 opening at thornton town center 
would not be affected by the lj hooker filing 
lj hooker is the malls main developer and biggs is slated 
to be the 700000square foot shopping centers main tenant 
pierre weaver executive vice president of hyper shoppes 
biggs parent company said the store can be successful regardless 
of the malls fate 
lj hooker has subsidiaries in the development and retail 
markets in a statement wednesday sigoloff said the bankruptcy 
filing which includes lj hooker homes will allow the company to 
restructure and repay debts which total about 12 billion 
under chapter 11 a federal court order frees the company from 
the threat of creditors lawsuits until it can develop a plan to 
put its finances in order the reorganization plan must be accepted 
by a majority of the creditors

wholesale prices driven down by declining 
costs for gasoline and new cars fell 04 percent in july for their 
biggest decline in three years the government reported today 
the drop last month in the labor departments producer price 
index followed a 01 percent dip in june as the wholesale inflation 
gauge registered its first backtoback monthly declines since 
early 1986 
the july improvement was even better than expected and bolstered 
the arguments of economists that inflation will be well behaved in 
the second half of the year giving the federal reserve more room 
to lower interest rates in an effort to keep the economy out of a 
recession 
in more good economic news the government reported today that 
retail sales bolstered by an upturn in auto spending shot up 09 
percent in july the biggest advance in three months with 
revisions to may and june sales showing significantly more strength 
than believed earlier 
these data suggest the economy continues to sustain modest 
growth with low inflation were on a sound economic course 
unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade inflation is 
going down growth is steady and the stock market rallying said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
we have the best of both worlds no inflation and increasing 
consumer spending said dirk van dongen president of the 
national association of wholesalerdistributors those are very 
good vital signs for the economy 
the news on inflation was particularly welcome because it came 
after a surge in prices earlier in the year had triggered fears 
that the country could be on the verge of another inflationary 
spiral 
even with the backtoback declines wholesale inflation through 
the first half of 1989 rose at an annual rate of 57 percent 
compared to last years 4 percent rise 
but the acceleration in prices had been caused by higher energy 
and food costs with both areas showing moderation now economists 
are looking for inflation to slow substantially in the last half of 
the year 
the 04 percent july drop in wholesale prices reflected the 
second monthly drop in gasoline prices which fell 72 percent 
after declining 4 percent in june 
another favorable price development came from a 19 percent 
decline in new car prices labor department analysts said this 
decrease reflected earlierthanusual endofthemodelyear 
discounting by automakers trying to clear out a large inventory of 
unsold cars 
food costs which had fallen a giant 08 percent in june edged 
up by 01 percent in july 
inflation excluding the food and energy categories fell as well 
in july dropping 02 percent because food and energy prices vary 
widely from month to month economists look to the inflation rate 
of other goods as an indication of underlying inflationary 
pressures 
the slight increase in food costs was attributed to a 25 
percent rise in beef prices which had fallen in june 
prices also turned up after june declines for fish pasta soft 
drinks coffee and rice 
fresh fruit prices continued to rise climbing 13 percent in 
july after a 14 percent jump a month earlier vegetable costs 
however took another big drop falling 9 percent after an 8 
percent june decline 
the gasoline price decline helped to mask an increase of 15 
percent in the cost of natural gas and a 03 percent rise in home 
heating oil costs 
the overall 04 percent july decline in the producer price index 
for finished goods one stop short of retail was the biggest 
onemonth drop since a 08 percent fall in july 1986 
the junejuly drops marked the first consecutive monthly 
declines since a fourmonth period of falling wholesale prices from 
january through april in 1986 
the improvement in july left the producer price index at 1140 
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 
would have cost 11400 last month 
economists worried at the beginning of the year that higher food 
and energy costs were threatening to become imbedded in permanently 
higher inflation rates as workers demanded higher wage increases to 
make up for the ground lost to rising prices 
that was a top concern at the federal reserve which began 
moving in march 1988 to push interest rates up in an effort to 
dampen inflationary pressures 
the feds goal was to slow economic growth enough to allow 
inflation to moderate without pushing the country into a recession 
in early june of this year the central bank switched course 
from worrying about inflation to worrying about an economic slump 
and conducted three modest moves since that time to lower interest 
rates 
many economists are looking for further credit easing on the 
part of the fed as the economy sends out further signals that 
inflation is slowing 
donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting at georgia 
state university said he expected wholesale prices would rise 51 
percent this year compared with an increase of 4 percent in 1988 
however in the first six months of the year wholesale prices 
were rising at an annual rate of 76 percent ratajczak said he 
expected prices would moderate significantly to an annual rate of 
less than 3 percent in the last six months of 1989

recession fears retail sales paced by renewed spending on 
automobiles rebounded 09 percent in july after posting their

a string of european central banks including west germanys 
bundesbank the bank of england and banks of belgium italy and 
switzerland were among those selling dollars the us federal 
reserve also sold dollars currency dealers reported

actions that were first reported by currency dealers the feds 
policy is not to comment on market reports of intervention

ual corp will likely face several suitors with 
sweeter offers than the 54 billion bid by california investor 
marvin davis analysts say 
some expect the airline companys management to come through 
with its own takeover bid that would include the participation of 
employees of united airlines uals biggest subsidiary 
but davis met with ual representatives thursday night at an 
airport in new york to discuss terms of the 240ashare proposal 
for the first time the new york times reported in todays editions 
the newspaper quoting people familiar with the offer said 
davis was telephoned by ual representatives about the boards 
decision wednesday to explore all possible financial and 
strategic alternatives for its future 
the newspaper said davis did not expect ual to be receptive to 
the offer davis and one of his key advisers in the deal held a 
series of meetings to prepare their presentatiion to ual thursday 
night 
the newspaper provided no other details of the meeting in new 
york 
ual spokesman rob doughty said he could not comment on the 
report 
kevin murphy an airline analyst with morgan stanley amp co in 
new york said davis offer was at the low end of an acceptable bid 
for ual which he estimated could fetch 300 a share or 675 
billion 
a leveraged buyout by management is emerging as the most popular 
scenario among industry observers in the wake of uals announcement 
wednesday 
analysts said uals management employees and the companys 
largest shareholder financier saul steinberg might join forces in 
a leveraged buyout 
in a leveraged buyout a management group buys a company mainly 
with borrowed money which it usually pays back by selling some of 
the companys assets or with its cash flows 
steinberg whose reliance group holdings inc has a 69 percent 
stake in the company is a longtime business associate and friend 
of ual chairman stephen m wolf 
uals longrunning labor disputes with its pilots and flight 
attendants the pilots have been without a contract for nearly 1 
years the flight attendants for about two years could provide an 
incentive for management to invite employees to join forces in a 
buyout 
that might be a feature of a labor settlement said analyst 
robert decker of duff amp phelps inc in chicago it would be a way 
for mr wolf to aproach his unions and give them a stake in the 
company with financial benefits as well as a way of increasing 
employee loyalty 
sara dornacker a spokeswoman for chicagobased ual said she 
could not comment on the possibility of a management takeover 
the united pilots who made their own buyout offer nearly two 
years ago have asked their financial and legal advisers to study 
the situation said their spokeswoman kathie hardin 
leaders of uniteds flight attendants union local were out of 
town and not immediately available for comment 
uals stock rose 725 to 25112 a share thursday on the new 
york stock exchange reflecting speculation that richer proposals 
would emerge the stock ended last week at 16450 a share 
pan am corp which has been seeking a merger partner is 
interested in bidding for ual according to its chairman thomas g 
plaskett the financially weak airline company unsuccessfully 
proposed a merger earlier this year with nwa inc parent of 
northwest airlines 
another potential bidder analysts said is the powerful new 
york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which like 
davis and pan am bid unsuccessfully for nwa earlier this year nwa 
eventually was purchased by an investor group led by alfred checchi

bond prices surged in early trading today 
driven by a new government report on wholesale prices that 
suggested inflation is under control 
the treasurys 30year bond rose point or about 875 per 
1000 face amount its yield which moves in the opposite 
direction from price plunged to 791 percent from 805 percent 
late thursday 
the labor department reported today that wholesale prices fell 
04 percent in july for their biggest decline in three years 
prices were pushed down by declining costs for gasoline and new 
cars the report said 
the drop as measured by the governments producer price index 
followed a 01 percent dip in june as the wholesale inflation 
gauge registered its first backtoback monthly declines since 
early 1986 
the bond market is stronger based on the producer price 
index said mitchell held managing director chief financial 
economist smith barney harris upham amp co 
the market had anticipated a rise of 01 to 02 percent held 
said 
the report is good news to bondholders whose investments are 
devalued by inflation it also bolstered arguments of economists 
that inflationary pressures will subside in the second half of the 
year giving the federal reserve more room to lower interest rates 
in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession 
analysts said the credit markets took little notice of a second 
government report on retail sales which shot up 09 percent last 
month to the highest level in three months in addition the 
government revised upward may and june sales 
the ppi is clearly outweighing the retail figures said 
irwin l kellner chief economist at manufacturers hanover trust co 
credit market analysts said prices could reverse course once the 
market digests the retail numbers 
we thought consumer spending was in a recession and all of a 
sudden we see that it has been rising said held this could 
influence the feds decision about easing credit 
the fed cannot ease unless we get some clearcut evidence that 
this economy is weak and it simply isnt there he said 
analysts said a healthy response to thursdays 975 billion 
refunding auction also carried over to this mornings market and 
helped firm prices 
the treasury sold the 30year bonds which go on sale next week 
at an average yield of 814 percent or slightly more than many 
dealers had been expecting a few days ago 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues rose between 116 point to 332 point 
intermediate maturities were up between point and 516 point and 
longterm securities had soared between 716 point and 1 132 
point according to telerate inc a financialinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was up 395 to 119354 by late 
morning 
in corporate trading industrials also gained moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures total return 
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 080 to 33258 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile fell to 799 
percent with the discount down 10 basis points at 774 percent 
yields on sixmonth bills fell to 786 as the discount lost 8 basis 
points to 747 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 791 
percent as the discount fell 10 basis points to 738 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other for overnight loans was quoted at 9 percent unchanged from 
late thursday

retail sales riding a wave of renewed auto 
sales posted a strong 09 percent increase in july the government 
said friday in a report providing fresh evidence the countrys 
longest peacetime expansion was in no danger of ending 
i think the widespread increase in retail sales indicates the 
consumer is alive and well commented allen sinai of the boston 
co economic advisers inc in new york certainly the data 
indicated no imminent recession 
you arent going to find any reasonable economist now who will 
tell you that we are heading into a recession agreed michael k 
evans of evans economics inc in washington 
economists watch retail sales closely as a barometer of economic 
health since they account for about onethird of the nations 
economic activity there have been fears that recent 
credittightening by the federal reserve to contain inflation might 
push the nation into a recession 
but the fed switched course in june and since then has nudged 
interest rates lower in an attempt to attain a socalled 
softlanding slower economic growth with low inflation the 
current economic expansion has lasted six and a half years 
bring out the champagne as far as fed chairman alan 
greenspan is concerned evans said he pulled off what most of 
his critics said couldnt be done 
the commerce department reported retail sales increased to a 
seasonally adjusted 1437 billion last month following a 01 
percent decline in june the june sales had been revised to 1424 
billion from the 1408 billion previously reported 
the department also sharply revised its may report saying sales 
actually rose 08 percent rather than fell 01 percent a spokesman 
said the unusually large change resulted from retailers reporting 
additional sales including about 300 million each in the auto and 
food categories and 100 million each in the restaurant building 
materials and general merchandise areas 
both revisions together with fridays report point to a 
stronger economy than previously thought 
automobile sales led junes increase although almost all 
categories posted moderate to strong improvements the exceptions 
furniture and other home furnishings down 03 percent and 
clothing down 15 percent gasoline station sales remained flat 
car sales which fell 1 percent in june rebounded last month 
with a huge 27 percent increase that was the best sales month 
since october 1988 when purchases rose 47 percent 
july auto sales totaled 317 billion the highest level since 
319 billion in december 1988 the department said the sales 
record was 339 billion in september 1986 
autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales 
excluding autos july retail sales rose 04 percent following 
increases of 02 percent in june and 12 percent in may 
both durable and nondurable categories posted increases 
durables bigticket items expected to last more than three years 
rose 17 percent after falling 09 percent in june and 05 
percent in may besides autos and home furnishings this category 
includes building materials up 06 percent 
sales of nondurable goods were up 04 percent after climbing 
04 percent in june and 02 percent in may restaurant sales were 
up 12 percent general merchandise including department stores 
05 percent food stores 06 percent and drug stores 01 percent 
for the three months from may through july overall retail sales 
were 6 percent higher than the same period in 1988

merrill lynch amp co said friday it would sell 
its residential real estate operations to the prudential insurance 
co of america for more than 300 million 
the transaction which includes merrill lynch realty a 
residential broker with 18000 salespeople in 450 offices 
nationwide will not have a significant effect on merrill lynchs 
net earnings the company said in a news release 
the announcement marks the final stroke of a divestiture that 
began four years ago when merrill lynch moved to focus on its core 
brokerdealer businesses 
merrill lynch said it will spend about 140 million to buy back 
publicly traded units of the fine homes international lp at 18 a 
piece before the partnership can be sold to prudential 
the brokerage formed fine homes a master limited partnership 
to run its residential real estate operations after an unsuccessful 
attempt to sell the operations outright it was reported that 
merrill lynch had hoped to reap at least 500 million from such a 
sale which would have included a residential mortgage business 
that was eliminated in 1987 
instead merrill lynch sold a minority interest in fine homes to 
the public in late 1986 the brokerage retains a 74 percent 
interest in the partnership 
this transaction culminates merrill lynchs divestiture of a 
business which while profitable is not part of our longterm 
global strategy said merrill lynch chairman and chief executive 
william a schreyer in a statement 
last year fine homes reported revenue of 7922 million and 
pretax income of 371 million 
also included in the transaction is merrill lynch relocation 
management which provides relocation services to the transferees 
of more than 400 corporations landvest a marketer of luxury 
properties network 50 an international real estate referral 
network and moran stahl amp boyer a management consulting firm 
this acquisition is an extremely good strategic fit with our 
growing operations in the residential real estate and relocation 
mortgage businesses said robert c winters chairman and chief 
executive of prudential 
it represents an outstanding opportunity for us to strengthen 
our position as a national provider of residential services which 
already include brokerage mortgage lending property appraisal and 
homeowners insurance 
prudential entered the residential brokerage business two years 
ago with prudential real estate affiliates a californiabased 
operation that currently has 347 franchised offices and 4900 
salespeople the company also provides home financing homeowners 
insurance and appraisal services 
prudential will combine fine homes with its real estate 
affiliates under a new unit fine homes realty offices will switch 
to the prudential name following the completion of the deal 
merrill continues to be involved in commercial real estate 
through investment banking and remains a provider of mortgage 
capital 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approval

us takeover specialists kohlberg kravis roberts 
and co might buy as much as 15 percent of btr plc a british 
industrial conglomerate the companies said friday 
kohlberg kravis has filed a statement with the us federal 
trade commission indicating it intends to buy 15 million or more 
of btr shares in the open market btr said 
the filing would allow kohlberg kravis to buy as much as 15 
percent of btr without making further disclosures to us antitrust 
authorities btr said to acquire a 15 percent stake at current 
prices would cost 19 billion 
kohlberg kravis considers any stake it may build in btr an 
investment btr said 
kohlberg kravis later confirmed the announcement saying it was 
pleased with the receptivity of btr to kkr being a shareholder in 
the company 
btr shares rose 58 cents to 728 on londons stock exchange 
with the companys current market value at about 13 billion a 
takeover bid for btr would rank as europes secondlargest ever 
only hoylake investments ltds pending hostile 21 billion bid 
for bat industries plc would be larger 
john cahill btrs chief executive said in a telephone 
interview from providence ri that his company didnt believe 
kohlberg kravis move was sinister and instead may represent a 
play for a toehold in the british market at a time when british 
stocks are undervalued relative to other markets 
kohlberg kravis past behavior pattern is not one of a hostile 
bidder he said 
btr produces equipment and components for the construction 
energy automotive electrical and other industries

most corn futures prices closed up the daily 
limit of 10 cents a bushel friday on the chicago board of trade 
following a government report projecting a lowerthanexpected us 
corn harvest 
other grain and soybean futures closed substantially higher 
the usda report released thursday afternoon projected a corn 
crop of 735 billion bushels compared with expectations of about 
753 billion bushels 
the government pegged this years us soybean production at 
191 billion bushels compared with market estimates of about 195 
billion and estimated the spring wheat crop at 487 million bushels 
compared with the 493 million estimated earlier 
the usda also lowered its estimates for canadian and soviet 
grain production suggesting that demand for us grains 
especially wheat is likely to increase 
analysts said the corn numbers were the most bullish among the 
three markets soybean prices were held in check by perceptions of 
a large south american soybean crop and by the usdas revision of 
its projected soybean stocks figure 
the agency added 30 million bushels to the size of the projected 
soybean stockpile on aug 31 the end of the 198889 marketing 
year the usda now expects surplus soybeans to total 155 million 
bushels this year 
at first blush it was friendly but once you got into the 
supplyanddemand it wasnt all that bullish said pat 
oconnell grainmarket analyst with refco inc a large 
chicagobased futures brokerage 
at the close wheat was cent to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 398 a bushel corn was 5 
cents to 10 cents higher with september at 234 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september at 141 a bushel 
soybeans were 8 cents to 16 cents higher with august at 615 a 
bushel

millionaire industrialist victor posner 
has decided to build five 30story condominium buildings on his 
oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap 
the florida department of natural resources had been trying 
since march to persuade the miami beach executive to swap his 13 
acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of stateowned land near 
the doral country club in miami 
the posner tract the citys only undeveloped oceanfront land 
is wedged between a strip of highrises and would have made a 
perfect setting for a park state officials said 
but posner thought the swap would not have been profitable for 
him said his attorney william j roberts 
the miami land formerly owned by the federal aviation 
administration is worth 8 million while posners land is worth 
15 million state officials said 
roberts said posner would proceed with plans to build the 
condominiums with 1500 units on the site were going full speed 
ahead he said 
but posner still needs approval from the state because two of 
the five buildings would be built near the ocean

drexel burnham lambert inc has agreed to pay 
a 100000 fine to the state securities department even though the 
government said it has no evidence the firm did anything wrong in 
the state 
the consent order stems from the possibility that drexels 
beverly hills calif junk bond department might have committed 
improper trades in arkansas from 1984 through 1986 
drexel agreed april 13 to pay 650 million and plead guilty to 
six felonies to settle securities and exchange commission fraud 
charges stemming from the governments insidertrading crackdown 
state securities commissioner beverly bassett said drexel would 
pay the 100000 even though it hasnt had an office in arkansas 
for four or five years 
the incentive here is to avoid us revoking or suspending their 
license the commissioner said this will sort of hold that in 
abeyance even if the felony convictions dont relate to 
activities in arkansas because theyre registered in the state and 
we dont look kindly on licensees having felony convictions 
she said the size of the fine was based on the size of arkansas 
and estimates of the amount of activity drexel had in the state 
she said most of drexels junk bonds were sold to pension funds 
institutional investors and savings and loans 
she said she has no idea what if any fraudulent securities 
actions had been committed by drexel in arkansas during the time 
period my guess is its not likely to be a significant number 
she said but we dont know were totally in a vacuum

directors of amr corp parent of american 
airlines strengthened the companys antitakeover provisions 
friday even though the company said it was unaware of any imminent 
takeover attempt 
if any person or group buys 10 percent of more of amrs 
outstanding common shares the companys share purchase plan would 
entitle stockholders to buy additional shares at half price the 
original plan adopted in 1986 called for the option to go in 
effect after a 20 percent acquisition 
additionally after a 10 percent acquisition but before a 50 
percent acquisition the companys board of directors would be 
entitled to exchange each share purchase right for one new share of 
common stock 
the share purchase rights plan was adopted originally to enable 
stockholders to maximize the longterm value of their investments 
officials said 
amr spokesman jim brown said neither the orginal plan nor the 
amendment is meant to block potential buyers from bidding for the 
company

general motors corp on friday announced an 
average preintroductory price increase of 34 percent for its 
1990 model cars over comparably equipped 1989 models a smaller 
rise than analysts have anticipated 
the announcement does not reflect final retail prices but gives 
an indication of how much gm prices may change from 1989 levels 
ford motor co has projected a 48 percent increase and chrysler 
corp has not yet made a projection 
the smallerthanexpected boost could be from gm trying to 
deescalate the incentive war that has been going on for most of 
the year said joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton in new 
york who said he has expected price increases to be around 5 
percent for the 1990 model cars 
by holding price increases lower than anticipated automakers 
may be able to justify offering smaller incentives and save on 
those costs he said 
gm spokesman terry sullivan said the company was seeking to 
partially recover increased material labor health care and other 
costs he said 09 percentage points of the increase could be 
attributed to federal requirements for passive restraint systems in 
1990 cars 
gm plans to install driverside air bags in 15 of its car lines 
or about 500000 vehicles during the 1990 model year the rest of 
the cars will have automatic seatbelts for drivers and frontseat 
passengers 
thomas wagner general manager of ford motor cos ford 
division said recently that he expected retail prices for 1990 
cars to increase about 48 percent over 1989 prices half of that 
increase was due to passive restraint systems he said 
ford is expected to announce formally its 1990 prices in 
midseptember

the dollar soared to its highest levels since 
early summer in heavy worldwide trading friday boosted largely by 
technical factors 
gold prices sank on the commodity exchange in new york gold 
bullion for current delivery fell 210 a troy ounce to close at 
36520 republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid for 
gold at 36350 an ounce down from 366 on thursday 
the dollars rally was already under way overseas when the 
government released economic data showing a 04 percent decline in 
july wholesale prices and a higherthanexpected 09 percent jump 
in retail sales during the same period 
the figures suggested that inflation may be abating while 
economic growth continues 
typically when wholesale prices decline interest rates come 
down and the dollar gets weaker said jack barbanel a senior 
vice president at gruntal amp co 
but investors felt reasonably comfortable that the federal 
reserve would not change interest rates and they were right 
he said there was no change friday in the federal funds rate the 
interest rates banks charge each other for overnight loans 
concerted dollarselling by the federal reserve and other major 
central banks failed to halt the currencys climb and that only 
served to reinforce its strength said ronald holzer chief 
dealer at harris trust and savings bank in chicago 
the way the market absorbed the dollars means intervention 
will be ineffective in the short run he said 
in addition the market was buoyed by japanese investors hearty 
appetite for us treasury issues the japanese bought more 30year 
bonds than had been expected at this weeks auction and traders 
think the trend could continue 
linda mclaughlin a trader at chemical new york capital markets 
group said that with the upcoming redemptions of japanese 
government securities later this month the japanese are likely to 
shift to higheryielding us securities 
there will be a continued need for dollars to make those 
purchases she said

london it was quoted at a higher rate of 14190 yen in new york

michael grozier went to his local video 
store to rent the latest hot movie what he got was an idea that 
turned the 28yearold former sheetmetal worker into a millionaire 
his vidtron inc drivein video rental stores in shoppingmall 
parking lot kiosks feed off the frustrations of customers who cant 
find the current top hits at larger video stores 
what i wanted to try and create was that golden arches the 
big v in the sky my goal i guess is to do to video what 
mcdonalds did to hamburgers grozier said 
with only four stores open peddling onenight rentals at 249 
each vidtron has a long way to go before becoming mcdonalds but 
its growing rapidly 
grozier has sold franchise rights for 21 regions across the 
country stores are scheduled to open in several cities and 
franchise agreements already sold include promises to open about 
400 stores which would bring 12 million in fees he said his 
goal is 500 stores by 1991 
the idea behind vidtron was hatched one evening over hamburgers 
grozier and his wife had just been disappointed again unable to 
rent a newly released videotape because all the copies were gone 
they were always out grozier said it gets frustrating 
you know my wife and i went to dairy queen had a hamburger 
and while i was sitting there i said you know somebody ought to 
have a video store that just carries the top 40 movies and it 
ought to be a drivethrough because you wouldnt need all that 
space like you have in a traditional walkin store just drive 
in and get a video and drive on home 
grozier didnt really intend to be that somebody but with his 
wifes urging he paid 250 for a kiosk once used by a drivein 
photo developer spent 40 on signs plunked down most of his 
5000 life savings for videotapes and opened vidtron in april 1986 
i put it right across the street from that video store that 
was always out with the idea that theyll go in cant get what 
they want there and then theyll see my sign across the street 
a few months later grozier brought in 400 on a saturday night 
it cost him about 80 a day to run the store 
i had a profit of a little over 300 which is more than i 
made all week doing sheet metal work so that convinced me that im 
going to give up the sheet metal work he said 
in the 2 years between the opening of his first store in 
cleburne and the first franchise sales last november grozier 
created a detailed operating plan from where to locate stores to 
what movies to buy 
some experts are skeptical of groziers chances noting that the 
big chains have become more sensitive to the kind of frustration 
that started grozier on his way but with viewers paying an 
estimated 1975 million each week to rent movies grozier says 
its worth a shot 
he opened a headquarters in cleburne and small town about 20 
miles south of fort worth and christened his company vidtron 
hoping for a name that would become as synonymous with videos as 
kleenex is to tissue 
he hired franchising experts to develop his precise system 
detailed in six manuals the heart of it is groziers rating system 
for movies popularity 
grozier decided he couldnt wait for billboard magazine to come 
out with the top 40 videos in a given week so he began rating 
movies on his own giving points for stars producers timing of 
the video release first run box office take and other factors 
which he keeps secret 
movies are ordered based on their rating 
another key strategy is location grozier recommends each 
vidtron be located in a parking lot across the street or very near 
a towns busiest video rental store 
there are other rules and grozier demands they be followed 
its michaels way or the highway he said 
vidtron will not carry xrated movies and like some other video 
rental businesses he decided the last temptation of christ was 
too controversial a movie to handle 
when one franchisee decided to carry last temptation anyway 
grozier countermanded the order 
when you buy a franchise you buy into the system he said 
the franchises are not cheap theres a 15000 initial fee 
with 12000 going to the regional franchise holder and 3000 to 
grozier and additional fees can push startup costs as high as 
70650 the lowest initial investment is estimated at 49650 
each franchise location pays vidtron weekly royalties of 8725 
for services that include training and ordering advice 
i could have gone out there and just sold the stores wham 
bam like that but i couldnt service them properly grozier 
said 
although grozier said bankers turned him away initially they 
now ask him for business he also is considering the idea of 
selling stock to the public he said 
grozier said that he and his wife occasionally return to dairy 
queen for a hamburger point to the table where they sat that 
fateful night and say thats where it all began

wholesale prices driven downward by new car 
discounts and cheaper gasoline fell 04 percent in july their 
biggest drop in three years the labor department said friday 
at the same time the commerce department said that retail sales 
jumped 09 percent last month and that consumer spending in may and 
june had not been as sluggish as previously thought 
analysts said the double dose of good economic news showed that 
inflationary pressures were easing and that the economy was in no 
danger of tumbling into a recession 
still the financial markets reacted skittishly in early 
trading bond prices soared and the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks rose above its 1987 alltime high but then 
sentiment turned bearish 
by the end of the day bonds fell and the dow jones industrial 
average was off 2864 points at 268399 well shy of record 
territory 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the days reports 
showed the country was on a sound economic course 
unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade inflation is 
going down growth is steady fitzwater said 
private economists who have spent much of the year alternately 
worrying about a possible inflationary spiral or an imminent 
recession said fridays reports showed that both fears were 
overblown 
alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve has pulled 
off what most of his critics said couldnt be done said michael 
k evans head of a washington forecasting firm you arent going 
to find any reasonable economist now who will tell you that we are 
heading into a recession 
the federal reserve has been trying to engineer a socalled 
softlanding for the economy in which economic growth slows enough 
to dampen inflationary pressures without dumping the country into a 
downturn 
many analysts said the july increase in retail sales the 
strongest advance since april coupled with upward revisions in the 
previous two months showed renewed confidence in the important 
consumer sector last week the government said healthy job growth 
had pushed the civilian unemployment rate down to 52 percent in 
july 
we have the best of both worlds no inflation and increasing 
consumer spending said dirk van dongen president of the 
national association of wholesalerdistributors 
the 04 percent july fall in wholesale prices was the biggest 
onemonth drop since july 1986 when prices eased 08 percent last 
months decline followed a 01 percent decline in june and amounted 
to the first backtoback declines since four consecutive downturns 
from january through april of 1986 
the news on inflation was particularly welcome because it came 
after a surge in prices earlier in the year had triggered fears 
that the country could be on the verge of another inflationary 
spiral 
before the consecutive declines wholesale costs this year were 
racing ahead at an annual rate topping 9 percent with the 
declines the annual inflation rate is now a more moderate 57 
percent 
many economists predicted a further easing of price pressures in 
the months ahead and said this would give the federal reserve more 
room to lower interest rates 
since early june the central bank has made three small moves to 
push interest rates lower after a yearlong effort to drive them 
higher as part of its antiinflation campaign 
the two biggest factors pushing prices down in july were a 72 
percent plunge in gasoline costs and a 19 percent drop in new car 
prices 
labor department analysts credited the drop in car prices to 
unusually early endofthemodelyear price cutting by automakers 
trying to clear out large inventories of unsold cars before 1990 
models appear that development boosted car sales in the retail 
sales report as well 
the gasoline price decline the biggest monthly drop since july 
1986 helped to mask an increase of 15 percent in the cost of 
natural gas and a 03 percent rise in home heating oil costs 
food costs which had plunged 08 percent in june edged up by 
01 percent in july reflecting higher beef prices which rose 25 
percent and a 13 percent rise for fresh fruit prices 
prices also turned upward for fish pasta soft drinks coffee 
and rice 
partially offsetting the gains was another big drop in vegetable 
prices down 9 percent after an 8 percent june decline 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories fell 
02 percent a good sign that the underlying rate of inflation is 
moderating economists said 
the improvement in july left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1140 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11400 last month

farm policymakers are gearing up for another 
effort to resolve an issue that has confounded congress for a 
decade huge disaster payments coming on top of major losses in 
the insurance program that was supposed to end these payments 
forever 
we must choose one or the other agriculture secretary 
clayton k yeutter told reporters a week ago after congress sent to 
president bush a drought relief package of almost 900 million 
disaster relief packages designed to keep farmers afloat in 
times of drought flooding and other unforeseeable calamities were 
a regular feature of agricultural politics until the current decade 
in 1980 congress revamped the federal crop insurance program 
which had been in effect in a miniature version since the dustbowl 
era the new expanded version was supposed to replace disaster 
payments but it didnt 
the current package of drought relief is the third approved 
since congress overhauled the crop insurance program and 
policymakers remain in a quandary about the issue it has been 
nagging for years yeutter said 
this is not something well be able to work out overnight of 
course yeutter said its a very complicated issue and one 
that has a multitude of ramifications but certainly we need to be 
ready at the end of the year at the latest in terms of any 
legislative proposals that might be required 
he said the timing is important because if we delay too long 
in pulling all this together well have to confront some of the 
same problems that we had in 1989 but we just have to take this a 
step at a time and try to get it done as quickly as possible 
yeutter left it open as to whether crop insurance changes should 
be part of the farm bill lawmakers plan to draw up next year or 
instead be incorporated into separate legislation he said the 
important thing was to choose one direction or the other and do so 
in a timely way 
were determined and committed to dealing decisively with the 
issue now rather than indecisively as has often been the case in 
the past he said 
addingto the urgency are big losses absorbed by the taxpayers 
under the current program since 1980 the red ink has totaled 2 
billion of that amount 617766000 came as a result of the 
drought last year when the program paid out 242 in indemnities 
for every dollar it received in premiums 
federal crop insurance has never actually broken even or into 
the black although it came within an eyelash of doing so in 1987 
congress has been hoping that an increase in participation in 
the crop insurance program would take away the political pressure 
for disaster assistance programs so far that has not materialized 
a 25member commission established by congress to seek ways to 
broaden participation and upgrade the program gave its report to 
lawmakers last week panel members were mainly representatives of 
grower groups and the insurance industry 
the panel recommends a wide array of changes in the program 
including new types of coverage special provisions for soybeans 
and sugar revamped pricing procedures and a discount for producers 
who pay their premiums early 
one recommendation designed to entice greater participation 
would expand the federal subsidy of crop insurance premiums 
the government currently subsidizes 30 percent of the premium 
for insurance on up to 65 percent of a farmers crop under the 
proposal it would apply the same subsidy to the first 75 percent 
an additional temporary subsidy would be applied to all levels up 
to 65 percent 
the commission is betting that the beefed up premium subsidies 
combined with other elements of the plan would raise participation 
considerably 
the cost estimate of the program however assuming 
participation by 40 percent of those eligible would climb to 750 
million a year that could well mean raised eyebrows at the office 
of management and budget 
another recommendation would ensure that no agricultural 
program including disaster assistance programs reduces or limits 
the benefits of the program due to a producers receipt of federal 
crop insurance indemnity payments 
the idea is to avoid scaring off prospective crop insurance 
buyers who might not be willing to purchase the coverage if they 
believed that any indemnities they received would be subtracted 
from their disaster assistance benefits 
the recommendation also plainly envisions the possibility of 
more disaster assistance bills coming through congress in the 
future

copper futures prices surged to a threemonth high friday on new 
yorks commodity exchange on panicky buying fueled by expectations 
of a miners strike beginning monday in peru the worlds 
sixthlargest producer 
the threatened strike is the latest addition to a long list of 
supportive factors that may point toward a repeat of the dramatic 
upward moves that occurred in late 1987 and late 1988 
on other markets friday corn futures rose the daily limit 
sugar was sharply higher energy futures fell precious metals were 
mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures settled 475 cents to 5 cents higher with august 
at 11735 a pound the highest settlement price for a nearby 
contract since may 19 
the threatened peruvian strike triggered the move but analysts 
said the rally actually reflected the convergence of many 
supportive factors 
the copper market today was every commodity traders dream 
the fundamentals and the technicals came together said william 
oneill director of research for elders futures inc in new york 
key fundamental factors besides the situation in peru included 
a 36dayold strike at the highland valley copper mine in 
british columbia 
frequent power outages in chile one of the worlds largest 
copper producers due to a drought 
the prolonged shutdown of the bougainville copper mine a 
target of frequent terrorist attacks in papua new guinea 
severe financial problems in zaire and potential labor problems 
in zambia two african nations that are important copper producers 
on the technical side the market pierced tough resistance at 
114 a pound bringing in successive waves of buying 
with so many problems plaguing the industry copper production 
is running below consumption for the third straight year 
analysts said the rally could mark the beginning of a bull move 
similar to those of 1987 and 1988 when tight supplies drove prices 
to record highs 
most corn futures prices closed up the permitted daily limit of 
10 cents a bushel friday on the chicago board of trade following a 
government report projecting a lowerthanexpected us corn 
harvest other grain and soybean futures also advanced

crop of 735 billion bushels compared with expectations of about 
753 billion bushels 
the government pegged this years us soybean production at 
191 billion bushels compared with market estimates of about 195 
billion and estimated the spring wheat crop at 487 million bushels 
compared with an expected 493 million 
the corn numbers were considered more bullish than those for 
wheat and soybeans soybean prices were held in check by 
perceptions of a large south american soybean crop and by the 
usdas revision of its projected soybean stocks figure 
wheat settled cent to 4 cents higher with september at 397 
a bushel corn was 5 cents to 10 cents higher with september at 
234 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september 
at 141 a bushel soybeans were 8 cents to 16 cents higher with 
august at 615 a bushel

exchange partly in anticipation of an expected large sugar 
purchase by india and partly on bullish chart signals 
sugar contracts settled 33 cent to 57 cent higher with october 
at 1442 cents a pound 
crude and heating oil futures slipped while gasoline was mixed 
in moderate trading on the new york mercantile exchange with 
little news to spur prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 14 cents 
lower with september at 1848 a barrel heating oil was 03 cent 
to 10 cent lower with september at 5020 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 30 cent lower to 06 cent higher with september at

bond prices finished lower friday after one of 
the wildest sessions of the year surging on encouraging inflation 
news but plunging as traders decided the federal reserve was not 
ready to loosen its credit policy 
the treasurys 30year bond ended up with a loss of 1 points 
or about 1250 per 1000 face amount earlier in the day the 
bond was up by about 15 for every 1000 in face value 
we used to get whipsaw days like this back in 1981 and 1982 
but you dont see reversals like this that often said elliott 
platt fixedincome research director for donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette securities corp 
the 30year bonds yield which moves in the opposite direction 
from price rose to 815 percent from 805 percent late thursday 
at midday the bonds yield had fallen to about 791 percent 
bond prices moved sharply higher early friday after the labor 
department reported that wholesale prices fell 04 percent in july 
many analysts had been expecting a modest increase the decline was 
the biggest in three years 
analysts said the report suggested inflation was no problem and 
encouraged speculation that the federal reserve would encourage 
lower interest rates a development that would boost prices of 
fixedincome securities 
but traders who were looking for immediate action by the central 
bank were disappointed when the fed stepped into the market at 
midday and arranged shortterm sales of securities a procedure 
that drains reserves from the monetary system and places upward 
pressure on interest rates 
the market wasnt expecting that and it took the wind out of 
the rally said kevin flanagan money market economist for dean 
witter reynolds 
he said a news service report that quoted an unidentified fed 
staffer as saying the central bank wasnt going to ease its credit 
policy soon further depressed the market and the selling seemed to 
feed on itself 
once a trend is set in motion it has a snowball effect 
flanagan said 
david hale chief economist for kemper financial services in 
chicago said as prices fell traders took a second look at a 
retail sales report also released friday morning and found 
surprising strength in the 09 percent gain for last month he said 
it suggested the fed would face no immediate pressure to relax its 
credit policy 
the abrupt turnabout shows these markets have a speculative 
quality to them hale said 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues lost between point and point 
intermediate maturities fell by about point and longterm issues 
gave up as much as 1 points according to telerate inc a 
financialinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 747 to 118212 
in corporate trading industrials dropped moodys investment 
grade corporate bond index which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer fell 194 to 32984 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 316 point the average yield to 
maturity rose to 726 percent from 725 percent late thursdday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile rose to 818 
percent with the discount up 8 basis points to 792 percent yields 
on sixmonth bills rose to 806 percent as the discount rose 10 
basis points to 765 percent yields on oneyear bills climbed to 
816 percent as the discount rose 12 basis points to 760 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other for overnight loans was quoted at 8 1516 percent down from 
9 percent late thursday

employees of the nations largest computer 
company said friday the firm would continue to pursue its dream of 
becoming chinas ibm even though its founder and president has 
become an exiled pariah because he supported the protests 
since the prodemocracy uprising the stone group co the 
largest computer company in china has launched a campaign through 
letters and personal visits to dispel rumors it will be shut down 
by the government because of its support for the student movement 
and westernstyle management techniques 
wan runnan founder chairman and president of the company 
stone group co was fired from his posts and expelled from the 
communist party because he supported the protests 
police are believed to have issued an arrest warrant for wan 
43 but he fled to the west shortly after the june 34 military 
crackdown on the protesters that left hundreds perhaps thousands 
of civilians dead 
employees said the board of directors fired wan in late july and 
replaced him with shen guojun formerly vice president and one of 
stones cofounders one employee said the companys upper echelons 
have been reorganized 
employees at the companys showroom in western beijings 
silicon village laughed friday at the rumors they would be 
closed 
look were open arent we were all here nobodys told us 
were going to be shut down said one department manager who 
like other stone employees spoke on condition of anonymity 
the showroom bustled with activity as clerks helped customers 
pick out electronics parts and sales representatives demonstrated 
equipment to potential buyers 
from its founding in 1984 stone quickly set itself apart from 
other chinese companies with its emphasis on employee incentives 
and its ready adoption of international business practices it 
became chinas leading privatesector success story showing what 
could be achieved with hard work and imagination under senior 
leader deng xiaopings economic reform program 
in may however wan is said to have joined student leaders in 
calling for deng and premier li peng to step down and for the 
government to lift martial law imposed to quell the protests 
stone also donated supplies to the students who occupied 
tiananmen square as did many private businesses 
we were all down there delivering things like sterilized 
towelettes even i went a young sales manager recalled with 
some embarrassment we thought we were doing the right thing 
the government claims stone donated more than just towelettes 
an official museum exhibit on the democracy movement which the 
government calls a counterrevolutionary rebellion includes a 
white daihatsu car that stone allegedly gave to student leaders 
members of a stone research institute collected signatures for a 
petition calling for an emergency meeting of chinas legislature to 
discuss ending martial law 
but on friday stone employees tried to distance themselves and 
the company from the democracy movement 
wan and the others are responsible for their own actions 
theyve been investigated by the authorities it doesnt have 
anything to do with stone one said

computer maker mai basic four said friday 
it expects to report a significant thirdquarter loss primarily 
because of expenses from its failed bid to buy prime computer inc 
mai basic four on thursday scrapped the last remnant of that 
attempt its 525 million cash offer to buy prime computers 
minicomputer business prime of natick mass agreed last week to 
sell the whole company to a new york venture capital firm

the restructuring and 5 million to 6 million in operating losses

harcourt brace jovanovich inc which publishes 
books sells insurance and operates theme parks said friday its 
secondquarter loss narrowed slightly to 426 million from a loss 
of 443 million a year earlier 
revenues for the quarter rose 53 percent to 4344 million from 
4124 million a year earlier 
publishing revenue rose 157 percent in the quarter to 221 
million and insurance revenue rose 103 percent to 1074 million 
but revenue from its theme parks fell 145 percent to 1057 
million 
the company said its publishing results reflected some revenue 
from textbook sales that are normally recorded in the third and 
fourth quarters 
revenue from insurance operations benefitted from the inclusion 
of results from 11 farm magazines previously reported with the 
publishing group 
harcourt blamed the revenue decline at its six theme parks 
partly on lost attendance at its central florida theme parks which 
faced competition from new attractions in the area 
the company has put its theme parks up for sale in an effort to 
reduce the debt it assumed two years ago when it undertook a 
recapitalization that thwarted a takeover bid from british 
publisher robert maxwell 
for the first six months harcourt lost 1587 million in 
contrast to a loss of 796 million a year earlier 
sixmonth revenue rose 89 percent to 7499 million from 6891 
million a year earlier

northwest airlines has reached tentative 
agreement on a longterm contract covering its 5000 pilots it was 
announced friday 
the contract offers an immediate average 93 percent pay raise 
and 4 percent average pay increases in september 1990 1991 and 
1992 it also includes improvements in wage equalization job 
security and productivity said terry erskine vice president of 
law and labor relations for the carrier 
the contract would extend through march 1 1994 combining under 
one contract former republic airlines pilots and longtime 
northwest pilots northwest acquired republic in 1986 
earlier friday an official with the national mediation board 
said the pilots and carrier had ended a twoweek stalemate in 
contract negotiations by resuming talks at the boards urging 
the talks had broken off during the last week of july when the 
pilots asked the board to declare an impasse the board had not 
ruled on any requests in the dispute said william a gill jr the 
assistant executive director 
all we have done is schedule a meeting for the parties to talk 
about their differences gill said before the contract agreement 
was announced 
the pilots have been without a contract for about 2 years 
before a federal mediator intervened last year the pilots had 
voted overwhelmingly to strike over wage benefit work rules and 
job security issues 
the pilots request for declaration of an impasse set up a 
possible strike but the mediation board would have had to grant 
the request and a 30day coolingoff period would have had to 
expire before the pilots could legally walk off their jobs 
analysts had said a strike would be a serious blow to the 
nations fourthlargest airline because the carrier needs all the 
cash it can muster in the wake of last weeks 365 billion buyout 
los angeles investor alfred checchi who led the takeover borrowed 
more than 3 billion to finance the acquisition 
the negotiations had been complicated by northwests acquisition 
of republic airlines an arbitrator merged the seniority lists of 
the two pilot groups last week and negotiators had to unite the two 
groups on other issues

trans world airlines inc reported friday a net 
loss of 44 million for the second quarter which it attributed 
partly to expenses stemming from last years privatization of the 
carrier 
twa owned by takeover specialist carl icahn said its 
secondquarter loss compared with a net profit of 972 million in 
the same period in 1988 
the yearearlier results include a onetime gain from litigation 
between twa and the estate of the late howard hughes a previous 
owner the results for the latest quarter do not include about 87 
million in unrealized gains from twas investment portfolio the 
company said 
the latest loss occurred despite a 57 percent increase in 
secondquarter revenue to 120 billion from 114 billion 
late last week twa suspended contract talks with the machinists 
union because of the possibility of a merger or change in 
management at the airline union officials said 
twa the nations sixthlargest airline confirmed that the 
talks had been halted but refused to say why icahn had previously 
expressed interest in buying strikebound eastern airlines and had 
been in extensive talks with that carriers unions his interest 
recently has shifted to other possible combinations according to 
machinists union officials 
for the first half of the year twa posted a net loss of 874 
million compared with a net profit of 447 million in the same 
period of 1988
