george esper who covered the vietnam war for 
the associated press from 1965 until its end in 1975 interviewed 
former red cross worker cherie rankin before her return to vietnam 
here are her reflections of her journey into the past 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like a growing number of americans who 
served in vietnam cherie rankin returned there after 20 years to 
help rebuild a small part of what the war destroyed 
in doing so she also restored a part of her life 
i think what it means is theres been enough distance from the 
trauma to make it safe for people to deal with it she said it 
means relations between our two countries are going to improve 
for six weeks ms rankin a former red cross worker labored in 
the punishing sun mixing mortar to help build a medical clinic near 
hanoi destroyed by us bombers 
at the end of october she came home to the united states for 
the second time a twiceinalifetime experience she cried 
for the living she left behind this trip the last time in 1971 
it was for the dead 
two decades ago she brought back with her the images of war 
orphans scorched by napalm and blinded by bombs this time she 
came back with images of carefree curious clinging children who 
followed her wherever she went 
returning home she clutched a hat full of love the conical hat 
her vietnamese coworkers signed as a remembrance on the day the 
clinic was finished and they parted with warm embraces and tears 
there was a lot of crying that day she recalled 
in a sense her return was part of a broader pilgrimage by 
americans in recent years their return is a sentimental journey a 
reconnecting with their past when they were young men and women 
undergoing a transcendent experience 
ms rankin was only 24 then for more than 10 years after she 
came home the first time in september 1971 after a years tour 
thinking about vietnam made her sick to her stomach she threw up 
at a reunion of red cross workers in 1984 
today at age 44 she said vietnam revisited has probably 
exorcised the demons from her mind that even counseling couldnt 
capture ms rankin herself is a psychotherapist 
i think it has probably put a closure on it in a way that it 
hadnt before she said i probably will never use the word 
resolve its not something i want to have resolved i dont ever 
want to forget the pain of the war because i might become 
complacent about war 
her return helped change the images in her mind of napalmed 
babies starving children and the poverty and sadness she read in 
the faces of the vietnamese when she was there two decades before 
what i see now is happy children sparkle and twinkles in 
the eyes of the people going on with their lives ms rankin 
said theres still incredible poverty but its not so dirty 
theyre not starving because they grow their own food and are able 
to do that now 
they still dont have things still live in small homes and 
they dont have access to good medical care but its not the same 
kind of thing that happened during the war when they were displaced 
from their ancestral roots and their agricultural attachment to the 
land 
ms rankin was part of a group of seven american civilians and 
military veterans who paid their own way to vietnam to build badly 
needed medical facilities they were the third team of americans to 
return under the auspices of the veterans vietnam restoration 
project in garberville calif 
only nongovernmental american organizations can give vietnam 
humanitarian aid since the two governments have no diplomatic 
relations and the united states has imposed a trade embargo on the 
country 
ms rankin said most of the vietnamese expressed interest in 
restoring relations so there could be free trade communications 
and travel 
they really are puzzled by our continued boycott of them and 
they were constantly in wonder of us she said it was 
impossible to walk down the street without being surrounded by 
adults as well as children 
i think that i and its probably true for the other veterans 
that went with me represented something bigger to the vietnamese 
the people we met saw us as representatives of our government so 
there was a sense that things were softening fifteen years 
is long enough to hold a grudge 
kevin bowen a veteran and codirector of the william joiner 
center for the study of war and social consequences at the 
university of massachusetts at boston said americans returning to 
vietnam are finding it a way of healing some of the mental wounds 
of the war 
i think for veterans in this country its important to get 
this episode behind us said bowen who has made five trips back 
to vietnam we need to have different relations with vietnam and 
with our past and not an angry vindictive relationship were not 
just punishing vietnam were punishing ourselves 
ms rankin returned to vietnam with the intention of mourning 
the men whose hands she held as they lay dying and the vietnamese 
orphans she embraced the blind the legless the retarded 
she had detached herself from her feelings during the war in 
order to do the job of building morale among the gis 
this time work got in her way 
i didnt really have a lot of time she said the work was 
very exhausting we also had a lot of demands on our afterhours 
time going to meet their governing bodies to functions and to 
cultural events 
but she cried when she said goodbye to her vietnamese friends at 
the clinic and when she visited the grounds of the sacred heart 
orphanage in da nang where she had tended the children in her free 
time 
the orphanage was almost exactly as she remembered it but the 
children had been moved to another home south of da nang in one of 
the many ironies of vietnam sacred heart now is home for old 
people who have nobody their children killed in the war 
after the clinic was built ms rankin spent two more weeks in 
vietnam she retraced her wartime steps in what was then south 
vietnam basking in the moments that almost seemed unreal and 
remembering 
the sites stepped out of history to meet her marble mountain 
monkey mountain china beach 
she recognized them all

law enforcement officials say 
violent crime is on the rise in some of europes traditionally 
lawabiding nations critics accuse them of stirring up fear to get 
bigger budgets 
the average homicide rate in europe remains only about onefifth 
that of the united states which has approximately nine homicides 
per 100000 people each year according to the un world health 
organization in geneva 
homicide rates for the netherlands and switzerland rose 20 
percent and 13 percent respectively in 1989 according to police 
figures 
norway reported a 29 percent rise in violent crime from 1986 
through 1988 and italian homicides increased by 35 percent last 
year mostly in mafia regions 
rape and theft skyrocketed last year in eastern europe 
accompaniments to economic instability and a deepseated mistrust 
of police under the former communist regimes 
in denmark france and portugal however the low homicide rates 
have hardly changed in recent years significant declines have been 
recorded in britain germany and belgium 
our whole society is getting more aggressive said 
commissioner herman bergsma of the central police intelligence 
service in holland what used to end up in fistfights now ends up 
in gunfights 
the number of assaults with firearms in the netherlands nearly 
doubled from 134 in 1985 to 245 last year mainly because of 
killings by drug traffickers bergsma said 
according to who statistics the homicide rate in this nation of 
149 million people had been one of the worlds lowest just above 
britain and ireland 
herman franke a criminologist at the university of amsterdam 
believes police are classifying more crime as violent to support 
requests for larger budgets and more officers 
crime statistics are highly political he said theyre 
used to influence public opinion in every country 
in the norwegian parliamentary elections the conservative party 
of progress went from 2 of the 165 seats to 22 on a wave of public 
anxiety that followed reports of the 29 percent growth in violent 
crime 
violent crime is not increasing franke said only our 
sensitivity to it 
nils christie a university of oslo criminology professor said 
our biggest crime problem is the unfounded anxiety people feel 
although the murder rate in neighboring sweden has barely 
changed in years tighter gun laws are to take effect in 1991 
total crimes reported in poland rose from 137000 in 1988 to 
more than 50000 last year 
the crime we witness today is a result of the political 
situation said janusz wydra deputy police chief of warsaw 
the more freedom there is the less security 
poland has embarked on a conversion from communism to capitalism 
that has cost about 1 million people their jobs and driven most 
prices up more than 180 percent 
franke the dutch criminologist argued that skyrocketing 
statistics in former communist countries indicate the old regimes 
doctored figures for political reasons not that crime has 
increased dramatically 
he conceded that homes and businesses in the new east european 
democracies are easy targets for thieves since their owners have 
little experience with crime prevention 
in warsaw the situation is terrifying said wincenty 
grzeszczyk of the polish general prosecutors department stores do 
a booming business in window grates auto alarms deadbolt locks 
and mace 
statistics in czechoslovakia indicate crime has increased 400 
percent in some prague districts since president vaclav havel 
declared a general amnesty in 1989 for most prisoners jailed under 
the communists the amnesty brought the release of about twothirds 
of the prison population 
muggings rose 250 percent in urban areas during the first six 
months of 1990 and total crime was up 138 percent in the same 
period according to official figures 
italy is the most crimeprone country in western europe last 
years 1295 homicides reflected a 35 percent increase from 1988 
britain tightened gun laws after a gun collector in hungerford 
60 miles west of london killed 16 people including his mother in 
august 1987 then took his own life the homicide rate has fallen 
by half under the new laws 
most european countries severely restrict gun ownership but 
firearms are relatively easy to buy on the black market 
police in copenhagen found hundreds of hand grenades mines 
antitank rockets handguns and rifles in the possession of a 
propalestinian group that had robbed banks for seven years 
still franke credited tough guncontrol laws with making 
european cities relatively murderfree because he said people 
cant resort to guns to solve their quarrels

though less then 1 percent of all known 
aids cases are in asia and the pacific the region can expect a 
dramatic increase over the next few years a new un report says 
the study released monday quoted an asian medical journal as 
saying all the factors that have allowed aids to assume epidemic 
proportions in africa poor genital health of women malnutrition 
hepatitis intestinal worms low immunity levels are just as 
endemic in asia 
the report was presented to a meeting in bangkok of the 
population and social development committee of the un economic 
and social commission for asia and the pacific the fiveday 
meeting began monday 
as of february there had been a total of 215144 aids cases 
reported in 153 countries but just 2067 of them were in asian and 
pacific countries the report says 
but the asiapacific figure may be low because nearly 
threefourths of the reported cases are in australia which has one 
of the regions best reporting systems the report notes 
many countries reported no cases at all and in some instances 
this was in conflict with other evidence it says 
there can be little doubt that the number of cases in the 
asian and pacific region will grow dramatically over the next few 
years 
the world health organization estimates there are now 500000 
hivinfected people in asia the report says 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus causes aids or acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome but people who become infected with hiv 
do not always get aids which fatally destroys the bodys immune 
system 
aids is most commonly transmitted through sexual intercourse 
infected hypodermic needles and blood transfusions 
hiv infection in the asiapacific region began later than in 
other parts of the world but the current growth in hiv infection 
in the region ensures that the number of aids cases will grow 
rapidly in the future the un report says 
it is projected that 75 percent of those with hiv infection 
will develop aids within 15 years and 95 percent within 20 years 
the report recommends stronger education and information 
campaigns to combat the spread of the disease

japanese companies have set their sights on doing 
business with vietnam which many avoided for years in order not to 
upset the united states 
its vietnam fever said tatsuo torigoe an asia division 
manager of kanematsu corp japans major trading house the time 
has finally come for us to make a move 
analysts in tokyo believe japanese televisions refrigerators 
and other household goods will soon fill shops in vietnam as they 
do in other nations around the globe 
they also expect japanese businessmen to buy more vietnamese 
petroleum oil already accounts for more than half japans imports 
from the southeast asian nation which is impoverished but rich in 
resources 
five times as many japanese companies sent representatives to 
vietnam in 1988 as in 1987 and it is my impression that there 
will be more this year said akitake yamamoto a spokesman for a 
kanematsu subsidiary that has traded there for more than 20 years 
until recent months japanese companies were either restricting 
business with vietnam or dealing discreetly 
activity was dampened by their governments support of the us 
policy of isolating vietnam and by a 1987 us senate resolution 
urging japan to prevent private companies from trading with 
vietnam 
although washington still refuses to establish formal diplomatic 
relations with vietnam there are indications it may be taking a 
less hostile attitude this has helped reawaken japanese interest 
the most visible example of a thaw was the agreement reached by 
secretary of state james a baker iii and foreign minister nguyen 
co thach of vietnam in september to cooperate in searching for 
american soldiers missing in action and in resolving cambodias 
civil war in which vietnamese troops have been heavily involved 
with that and recent vietnamse efforts to entice foreign 
investment japanese companies are shedding reservations about 
doing business there 
kanematsu has applied to the vietnamese government for a license 
to open offices in hanoi and ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
the bank of tokyo which had a branch in saigon in 19621975 
began to consider reopening it when we realized the improving 
cambodian situation and vietnamese economy over the last couple of 
years said spokesman kazuhiro miya 
victor co of japan which already exports television sets to 
vietnam and sanyo electric trade co a purveyor of home 
appliances both plan to open offices in ho chi minh city 
our business in vietnam is determined by the japanese 
governments policy which is based on the usvietnamese 
relations miya said when the usvietnamese relationship 
improves more well be a few steps ahead of the americans 
trade already is increasing dramatically japanese exports to 
vietnam reached 270 million in the first half of 1990 up 84 
percent from the same period in 1989 and imports from vietnam 
increased twothirds to 124 million 
vietnams population of about 67 million also may provide 
japanese companies with a source of cheap labor 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said the government 
was not particularly concerned about the renewed business interest 
in vietnam asked about us reaction he replied i think weve 
been exchanging views 
a us diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity 
noted that the united states has yet to lift restrictions on 
americans doing business with vietnam 
what other governments do with their business people is their 
business he said i think the government of japan is aware of 
our view that relations should not be entirely normalized that we 
cannot conduct business as usual until the cambodian conflict is 
resolved 
it is not yet business as usual between tokyo and hanoi but 
relations clearly are improving 
in october thach became the first vietnamese foreign minister 
in 12 years to pay an official visit to japan 
japan promised him a 180000 grant for vietnams national 
television station the first major economic assistance since 1978 
the foreign ministry said 
japanese corporations believe they can help vietnams backward 
economy enter the modern world 
torigoe the kanematsu official said his firm plans to renovate 
vietnamese factories and equipment to help make the countrys 
products competitive 
we are not doing this for charity he said we dont mind 
extra investments considering vietnams potential and its location 
close by vietnam is that attractive

syria a newfound us ally against saddam 
hussein has a chemical weapons arsenal at least as dangerous as 
iraqs us experts say 
the two nations are believed to be the biggest producers of 
chemical weapons in the mideast creating hundreds of tons of the 
deadly gas each year world attention has focused on iraqs 
chemical capability in the three months since its unprovoked 
invasion of neighboring kuwait 
washingtons relations with damascus strained for many years 
over syrias support for international terrorism and its hardline 
positions against israel have warmed in recent weeks since the 
syrians joined the antiiraq coalition 
syria has promised to send 15000 troops to join the usled 
multinational force arrayed against iraq in saudi arabia 
us officials say they are concerned about the syrian chemical 
weapons production and have tried to prevent syria from obtaining 
the materials necessary to produce such arms 
the united states is part of the australia group named for the 
country that initiated the international effort to stop the 
proliferation of cheical weapons the poor mans atom bomb 
the 16nation group tracks companies that sell components for 
the production of nerve and mustard gas and encourages governments 
to tighten their export control laws for such chemicals and to 
prosecute violators 
at least five arab countries manufacture chemical weapons 
syria egypt iran iraq and libya israel also is known to have a 
sizable chemical weapons cache 
syrias chemical warfare program has been a cause of concern to 
its biggest arms supplier the soviet union in 1988 the head of 
the soviet chemical warfare corps vladimir pikalov visited syria 
to find out what it was up to said seth carus a modern warfare 
expert 
the soviets believed the syrians were lying to them about not 
producing chemical weapons said carus 
but attempts to stop syria have largely failed 
syria like iraq got most of its help in setting up production 
facilities through german companies although other western 
european firms also were involved experts say 
damascus received its first chemical weapons from egypt in 1972 
in the form of chemicalfilled artillery shells but did not use 
such weapons in its 1973 war with israel 
it acquired production capability in the mid1980s 
concentrating on the agent sarin which paralyzes the human nervous 
system said carus syria is believed to have two production 
facilities one just north of damascus and the other near the city 
of homs the program is run by cers a governmental scientific 
research authority 
syria produces several hundred tons of nerve and mustard gas 
every year said carus iraq is believed to produce an estimated 
800 tons of nerve and mustard agents every year 
but syria is believed to have more accurate means of delivering 
the chemicals than iraq does 
israeli experts who track the syrian program believe syria has 
equipped sovietmade ss21 rockets with chemical warheads said 
leonard specter an arms control researcher at the carnegie 
endowment for international peace 
the shortrange ss21s are highly accurate and could inflict 
severe damage on nextdoor israel immobilizing its air force and 
reserve callups in the initial stages of a war said specter 
syria also is believed to have equipped longerrange scud missiles 
with chemical delivery capability 
iraq may have placed chemical warheads on some of its 
sovietdesigned scuds which have been modified to reach targets as 
far away as israel 600 miles away 
syria also could attack israel with chemical artillery shells 
which are far cheaper and more abundant than missiles said edward 
luttwak of the center for strategic and international studies 
they have the advantage of being near enough to israel to use 
shells and cause damage he said 
but most independent experts believe syria is unlikely to use 
chemical weapons unless it felt seriously threatened by israels 
superior military might 
specter said some weapons are less usable because of who your 
adversary is syria would have to think long and hard before it 
risked retaliation from israel or iraq for that matter 
iraq and iran are known to have used chemical weapons during 
their eightyear war in the 1980s and egypt is known to have 
mounted 32 attacks with such weapons while putting down an 
insurrection in yemen in the 1960s 
iraq also unleashed chemical agents against its kurdish minority 
in 1988 killing and wounding thousands

along the champs elysees sidewalks bustle with 
tourists and shoppers a block away a posh neighborhood is sealed 
off by steel barricades and riot police so world leaders can talk 
peace 
it is one of many contrasts to be found in paris as the leaders 
of 34 countries convene a threeday summit today intended to push 
europe into the postcold war era 
throughout the area around the ornate kleber international 
conference center are flags tents and festive decorations equally 
evident are the manifestations of a vast stateoftheart security 
operation 
police have conducted doortodoor inspections of buildings in 
the vicinity interviewing residents and issuing special passes so 
they can use their homes sewers have been checked for bombs and 
sophisticated xray machines have been installed at the entrances 
of conference facilities 
more than 10000 french police have been mobilized complemented 
by the secret service agents of individual leaders 
while secretary of state james a baker iii held talks sunday 
night at the luxury intercontinental hotel one his agents clad in 
a jogging suit spoke into a walkietalkie in the lobby 
a horde of cameramen and photographers seeking to cover baker 
were asked to lay their equipment on the floor in came a hound 
that sniffed the cameras for explosives 
along with security there is a strong emphasis on public 
relations 
the french have issued mountains of press releases giving 
background on the summit the soviets opened a special press center 
at their embassy where the thousands of journalists on hand can 
pick up glossy brochures about mikhail gorbachev 
even the soviet republic of armenia not a participant at any 
level in the summit has scheduled a press conference 
parisians have been warned to avoid driving in the area around 
the conference center and the arc de triomphe the kleber subway 
stop has been closed several bus routes suspended and numerous 
streets closed off 
two taxi drivers wondered bitterly why the summit had to be in 
paris rather than one of the grand chateaus on the outskirts of 
the city 
said one the leaders are coming to make peace but for us 
work will be war

the supreme court is condoning at least brief 
gag orders against the news media by refusing to let cable news 
network broadcast taperecorded conversations of panamas gen 
manuel noriega say free press advocates 
they said the justices action sunday was extraordinary and 
poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings 
nationwide 
attorney floyd abrams who is representing cnn said the 
court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and 
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles 
the high courts 72 rejection of cnns emergency request does 
seem to countenance brief prior restraints of a few days duration 
based on almost no showing of need at all he said 
the courts action sunday effectively bars cnn from broadcasting 
taperecordings of conversations between noriega and his lawyers 
cnn had asked the justices to lift us district judge william 
hoevelers order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine 
what is on the tapes 
the network said it will now turn over the tapes to hoevelers 
court in miami 
bruce sanford a lawyer who represents the society of 
professional journalists said the supreme court decision is a 
grave disappointment that departs from existing supreme court 
precedent it is particularly troublesome because it seems 
inconceivable that noriegas counsel would ever be able to prove 
that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the cnn 
tapes 
jane kirtley executive director of the reporters committee for 
freedom of the press called the development a stunning departure 
that signals a new era in first amendment jurisprudence it will 
have a farreaching impact in courts around the country 
however noriega defense attorney jon may said we think its 
a correct ruling this was a major mistake by cnn a big big 
mistake this is a case of the messenger shooting itself to 
whatever extent the media may complain this is a significant 
adverse decision cnn has only itself to blame 
only justices thurgood marshall and sandra day oconnor sided 
with cnn 
marshall writing for both said i do not see how the prior 
restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled with prior high 
court rulings he said hoevelers nov 8 order barring the cnn 
broadcasts is based on the remarkable conclusion that publication 
can be automatically restrained while courts study the basis for 
such restraints 
the seven justices who rejected cnns application were silent 
leaving it unclear what they believe about the underlying 
controversy 
in the majority were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun john paul stevens 
antonin scalia anthony m kennedy and david h souter 
the high court order does not preclude the justices from some 
day deciding that hoevelers order did violate cnns free speech 
rights protected by the first amendment 
the court could have refused to help cnn on some narrower 
grounds and could review the issue at a later date if there is 
still a live controversy 
the bush administration had joined with noriegas lawyers in 
opposing the cnn request 
the justice department had said the first amendment is part 
of the rule of law not above it a lasting prior restraint on 
publication may be justified only in the most extraordinary 
circumstances but the rule of law requires permitting a court to 
determine if those circumstances exist 
in addition to cnns emergency request the court also issued a 
onesentence order turning down a formal appeal filed by the cable 
network 
cnn president tom johnson called the courts decision a loss 
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship 
he said he hopes hoeveler will permit cnn to air the tapes after 
reviewing them 
the federal government lost a muchpublicized battle over a 
prior restraint in 1971 when the supreme court allowed the new york 
times and the washington post to publish the socalled pentagon 
papers detailing american involvement in vietnam 
but some observers noted that for several days the high court 
itself had in effect blocked publication while it was reviewing 
the dispute 
the prior restraint then was based on the governments claim 
that publication would hurt national security 
in a key 1976 decision the court unanimously struck down a gag 
order issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a 
nebraska murder case the court said then that such orders may be 
used only as a last resort and that judges first must consider less 
drastic measures 
noriega who is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million 
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through panama is being held 
in a federal prison near miami federal prison authorities monitor 
and taperecord all inmates telephone conversations except those 
between inmates and their defense teams 
but the cnn tape recordings reportedly contain some 
conversations between the deposed panamanian leader and his 
lawyers

chancellor helmut kohl attends this weeks 
conference on security and cooperation in europe with more prestige 
and power than any postworld war ii german leader 
instead of two german nameplates at the paris conference one 
each for west germany and east germany there will be just one 
the federal republic of germany 
seated behind the nameplate will be kohl architect of one of 
the most dramatic episodes in modern european history german 
reunification 
attesting to kohls elevated status are plans for the german 
chancellor to deliver a major address on tuesday the second day of 
the threeday meeting 
kohl likely will use his address to repeat his calls for faster 
economic and political integration of europe 
after fusing the two germanys kohl now wants to be seen as a 
prime mover for european unity the paris gathering could give him 
a test of his sometimes faulted statesmanship and provide signs of 
how germany will wield its new might 
even before german unification kohl had left a strong imprint 
on plans for creating a barrierfree internal market within the 
european community by 1992 and now his government is helping set 
the pace for the ecs planned economic and monetary union 
at a summit last month ec leaders agreed on a timetable for 
economic and monetary union that reflected german conditions 
kohl has been praised even by his political opponents for 
the way he steered germany to unification 
but he sometimes disappoints his allies on key international 
matters including his reluctance earlier this year to pledge that 
a united germany would recognize polands western border 
kohls latest difficulties in the international arena are 
cropping up because of the crisis in the persian gulf 
the chancellor backed willy brandts oneman hostage rescue 
mission to baghdad a trip that was denounced by washington and 
some european governments 
early in the gulf crisis he also faced accusations that he was 
focusing on unification and other german interests at the expense 
of global problems 
kohl has insisted that the new united germany will live up to 
global responsibilities befitting its power 
president bush and the other summiteers undoubtedly will be keen 
to hear from kohl how this will be done 
in paris kohl also may face questions about his ideas on the 
proper role of germanys military 
kohls defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said that 
germanys armed forces in the future must be ready to help resolve 
regional european conflicts 
there will likely also be interest in paris about germanys 
everexpanding relationship with the soviet union there are 
worries among some in western europe that germany is drifting from 
the west 
on nov 9 in bonn soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
kohl signed the most important germansoviet treaty of the postwar 
period 
the document commits the two nations to intensify their 
political cultural and economic ties over the next 20 years 
the two nations also pledged not to attack one another and to 
respect the boundaries of all european nations

replacements for older ones the allowable number tanks for all of 
eastern europe will be 20000 
the united states and its nato allies also will be allowed 
20000 tanks that will require a cut of about 4000 for nato

tanks already are being moved from europe to saudi arabia

a federal program to subsidize us 
agricultural exports will be continued under the 1990 farm bill 
and the agriculture department says it will be used aggressively to 
meet foreign competition 
but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says that ideally all 
countries ought to do away with export subsidies that was the 
original idea going into negotiations under the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade 
for some time however the united states has pushed for a 90 
percent reduction in export subsidies over 10 years 
yeutter in europe last week said that if the current uruguay 
round of talks fails it will be another decade or so before gatt 
gets to another negotiating round 
we have procrastinated long enough with agricultural trade 
reform he said at a news conference in bonn we need to get it 
under way that means significant disciplines of export 
subsidies 
yeutter continued we would prefer to see export subsidies 
eliminated from the face of the earth insofar as agricultural trade 
is concerned as we have already done in the gatt with industrial 
export subsidies 
the 1990 farm bill is scheduled to be sent to the white house 
this week where it will await president bushs signature upon his 
return from europe and the mideast 
meanwhile the usda has issued a report updating the export 
enhancement program or eep as the subsidy arrangement is called 
the eep was created in 1985 to 
boost us agricultural exports 
challenge unfair trade practices that hurt us exports 
particularly those of the european community 
encourage serious negotiations on agricultural trade under 
gatt 
under the program us exporters can get free surplus 
governmentowned commodities as bonuses or subsidies so shippers 
can keep prices competitive with other countries trying to sell to 
the same markets 
the department maintains a list of countries eligible for eep 
sales and there is a list of commodities that can qualify for the 
subsidies 
as of oct 1 the department had announced 110 initiatives 
for selling 12 different farm commodities to 73 countries the 
bonuses or subsidies paid to exporters since 1986 total 287 
billion 
the new farm bill the food agriculture conservation and 
trade act of 1990 includes reauthorization of eep through 1995 
it also continues the usda policy of not issuing new eep 
initiatives that would adversely impact the agricultural exports of 
nonsubsidizing competitors the report said 
wheat is the biggest item among the dozen commodities that are 
currently on the eep list accounting for more than 80 percent of 
the value of sales under the program 
onehalf of the total us wheat exports from 1985 to 1989 were 
sold under eep subsidy arrangements of the 287 billion in eep 
subsidies paid to exporters wheat has accounted for about 203 
billion 
other items and their shares of eep subsidies flour 2145 
million feed grains 2735 million semolina 124 million 
barley malt 219 million rice 159 million poultry feed 
166 million vegetable oil 671 million frozen poultry 1136 
million dairy cattle 928 million and table eggs 125 
million 
 
washington ap the national rural electric cooperative 
association says federal spending cuts negotiated between congress 
and the bush administration will erode an already faltering rural 
economy if they are not reversed 
we must seek more adequate loan funds for rural 
electrification bob bergland the associations executive vice 
president said in a statement last week 
bergland a former secretary of agriculture said the budget 
reconciliation act of 1990 imposes a further 25 percent cut in 
lending by the rural electrification administration an agency of 
the agriculture department 
the rural program he said has already absorbed a 40 percent 
reduction in direct loan funds over the past eight years 
meanwhile other segments of the electric utility industry have 
been left untouched bergland said 
according to the association which is the national lobbying arm 
of local reafinanced electric cooperatives its members serve more 
than 25 million consumers in the most sparsely settled areas of 46 
states 
 
washington ap field bindweed described as an outofcontrol 
morning glory may be in for some bad times from an imported mite 
from the mediterranean 
the mite is only oneseventyfifth of an inch long said 
entomologist sara s rosenthal of the departments agricultural 
research service but it has been cleared for attacking bindweed 
which can strangle corn and other crop plants 
rosenthal who works at the agencys rangeland weeds laboratory 
in bozeman mont said the mites were collected near rome and were 
released in texas and new jersey in the spring of last year 
the tiny mite previously had been found to eat the stems and 
leaves of field bindweed and closely related plants none of which 
are farm crops 
preliminary reviews show the mite survived last winter and 
reproduced at both the texas and new jersey sites the agency said 
in a report released here

for the first time in a long time senate 
democrats have a no 2 guy who doesnt seem to want a better job 
wendell h ford of kentucky at 66 is the senates new 
assistant majority leader replacing the ailing alan cranston 
dcalif 
cranston who stepped out of fords way because of poor health 
at one time viewed himself as presidential timber so did his 
predecessor robert c byrd and so too his predecessor edward 
m kennedy who may still 
ford however has signaled no such aspirations the third new 
o 2 leader in the capitol in less than two years the other two 
are in the house hes by far the most deferential 
the majority leader will be the spokesman for the senate 
democratic party he said referring to sen george mitchell 
dmaine nine years fords junior who may have presidential 
ambitions of his own one day 
a master of the inside game of the senate ford coveted the 
ultimate insiders position which he now holds and plans to keep it 
inside his hope and that of the colleagues who elected him is 
that the senate will look a little better from the outside 
it took more than two years for ford to win the post he started 
late in 1988 trying to unseat cranston in that years 
insidethecapitol party elections on a campaign theme of trying to 
make the senate work better 
ford was soundly beaten by cranston who had held the post since 
1977 but ford never stopped running and cranstons stock went 
down in the wake of his ties to charles keating former head of the 
failed lincoln savings and loan 
few doubt that ford would have won last weeks vote even if 
cranston had not dropped out of the race less than a week earlier 
ford managed to scare off a potential challenge by sen david 
pryor dark and win the race uncontested 
ask ford what he wants to do as whip and he says he wants to do 
all he can to make mitchells job a little easier thats the 
politically correct answer to give and ford makes it believable 
ford a former governor of kentucky was first elected to the 
senate in 1974 a lot of former governors find the senate 
frustrating the slow pace maddening the inefficiencies compared 
to the executive branch ridiculous 
but wendell ford found a home 
over the years he has been most vigorous in defending his home 
state interests including the tobacco liquor and coal industries 
he also is known for his hospitality when colleagues make an 
annual pilgrimage to the kentucky derby hes the kind of guy who 
picks up the tab at the bar for outoftown guests 
and thats the way he does business in the senate ford has a 
strong preference for working out deals with his colleagues before 
they result in full senate blowups 
on tobacco for example he was instrumental in working out a 
new price support program as part of a 1986 budget compromise that 
made permanent the 16centapack federal tax on cigarettes 
he also helped work out an eventual 8cent additional increase 
in the tobacco levy in the latest deficitreduction package the 
increase was agreed to early in the budget talks avoiding 
political bloodshed and a possible showdown with lawmakers who were 
demanding far stiffer taxes 
not that ford is afraid of showdowns in 1987 when sen john 
chafee rri tried to end tobacco export subsidies ford 
threatened to retaliate against federal programs that help rhode 
island 
from his senior position on the energy committee he vowed there 
would be blood on the carpet of the senate if western states 
succeeded in getting a coal slurry pipeline to help deliver their 
coal to markets to the south and east 
those would be tough positions to defend if ford were running 
for a national office but they surely havent hurt him in 
kentucky where he won his last election in 1986 with a state 
record 74 percent of the vote 
fords style would give one the impression that he shies away 
from the big issues of the day but thats not the case 
asked last week about the situation in the persian gulf ford 
stated his strong preference for giving the economic sanctions more 
time to work lots more time a year or more vietnam with 
sand was his description of the risk of war 
not surprisingly fords position was right in line with 
majority leader mitchells a comfortable place especially if 
youre comfortable being no 2

first lady barbara bush says she believes iraqi 
president saddam hussein will see the wisdom of withdrawing 
from occupied kuwait before the persian gulf crisis escalates into 
war 
speaking sunday with reporters on air force one mrs bush said 
she was looking forward to spending thanksgiving with us troops 
deployed to the persian gulf region except for one thing 
were visiting american troops and i hate to have them see me 
in pants she said she said she would wear comfortable 
kennebunkport clothes in the desert like those she wears at the 
first familys vacation home on the maine coast

germany where they had visited german chancellor helmut kohl 
she was wearing a silver bracelet which read operation desert 
shield a call to freedom she said it was a gift from her 
daughter dorothy leblond and that she had been wearing it for the 
past two weeks 
i think its a nice reminder it snags on everything i wear 
it cuts into me at night it reminds me i think its important 
asked if she believed the persian gulf standoff would result in 
a war she replied no so much of the world is united against 
iraq that i think he saddam will see the wisdom of it 
asked if she were concerned for the safety of the president and 
herself when they visit us forces so close to the kuwait and iraq 
borders 
i honestly wouldnt go on the trip if i thought it wasnt 
safe she said 
wed rather be home for thanksgiving but so would 200000 
other people she added referring to the troops in the region 
she and her husband plan to make three separate stops to share 
thanksgiving with us forces including on a naval vessel in the 
gulf did she really intend to eat three separate dinners 
you know i was built for the job said the fullfigured

the government has repealed a 
14yearold decree that allowed police to summarily shut down 
publications in the name of national security or law and order 
state radio said today 
police now need a court order 
the decree was scrapped effective sunday in an order issued by 
thailands constitutional monarch king bhumibol adulyadej and 
countersigned by prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
the repealed decree was issued on oct 21 1976 by the 
government of prime minister thanin kraivichien which was 
installed by the military following a bloody coup 
journalists united to lobby for the decrees repeal after police 
invoked it in february to shut the naew na newspaper for publishing 
a sensationalist headline about the murder of saudi diplomats in 
bangkok 
police had argued that the headline was damaging to thaisaudi 
relations 
the thai press has already been known as possibly the most 
free in southeast asia a major plus for thailand in the eyes of 
the international community the bangkok post said in an 
editorial today 
this freedom is made all the more wholesome now that the most 
serious legal hindrance has been removed 
it said thailand is now in an enhanced position to become the 
new regional center for the printing of foreign newspapers and 
magazines

hostages by march 25

of its actual demand ueda said 
the official iraqi news agency said sunday the guests as it 
calls the captives would be allowed depart beginning december 25 
if nothing mars the atmosphere of peace

yenbuying because the iraqi move was widely seen in the market as 
a strategy that will not necessarily lead to a withdrawal from

massachusetts hunters got their first 
autumn opportunity since the 1800s to pot one of the wily birds 
that were on the first thanksgiving table in 1621 
the wild turkey is back in the land of the pilgrims less than 
20 years after the first were reintroduced and last week about 
7000 hunters using bows or shotguns took part in a sixday turkey 
season in the berkshires 
final totals were not yet in sunday but just 200 of the 8000 
to 10000 birds now found in western massachusetts were bagged in 
the first two days said james cardoza of the state division of 
fisheries and wildlife 
unlike their domestic cousins wild turkeys have sharp eyesight 
and firstrate hearing and are masters of the duck and scramble a 
flock that can seem to fill a clearing in a blink of an eye can 
disappear just as fast 
it takes an awful lot of effort and skill cardoza said 
limited spring hunting has been allowed since 1981 
cardoza launched massachusetts wild turkey repopulation efforts 
in 1972 by trapping 37 birds in western new york since 1979 he has 
been catching and moving some of the birds from the berkshires into 
forested areas of eastern and coastal massachusetts including 
plymouth the home of the pilgrims 
in 1621 four wild turkeys were part of the pilgrims first 
thanksgiving feast the birds disappeared from the state before the 
civil war 
a big reason for their resurgence is the reforestation of the 
state that had been largely cleared for farming in the 1800s 
cardoza said they like mature woodlands where they can find 
acorns and beechnuts he said 
massachusetts is not alone in its success in 1952 there were

four bombs thrown by unidentified 
assailants exploded today at the home of the philippine justice 
secretary today in what the official called an apparent 
assassination attempt 
one struck the wall near the window of the secondstory bedroom 
where justice secretary franklin drilon his wife violetta and two 
young sons were sleeping 
the other blasts heavily damaged a wall around the house 
shattered windows overturned furniture and blasted a 
ninefootdeep hole in the yard drilon said 
drilon said he and his family were sleeping when the blasts 
occurred at 405 am in the fashionable greenhills district of 
suburban san juan about one mile from the national police 
headquarters 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility and drilon said 
he was unsure who threw the bombs drilon said at least one of the 
bombs contained the plastic explosive c4 often used by rightwing 
military extremists 
he said the bombs were so powerful that they were apparently not 
designed simply to scare him 
drilon was appointed justice secretary on dec 31 as part of a 
cabinet shakeup following a bloody coup attempt earlier in the 
month he had served as labor secretary since 1987 
drilon also serves as chairman of the cabinet security 
committee which advises president corazon aquino on national 
security issues 
the manila and the manila times reported today that military 
intelligence expects rightwing extremists to launch a new coup 
attempt between nov 30 and dec 10 
the newspapers quoted unnamed military sources as saying the 
plan called for coordinated uprisings in northern and southern 
provinces directed by renegade commodore domingo calajate a leader 
of last decembers failed putsch 
last month mutineers staged a threeday uprising in mindanao 
island which the military said was to have been the trigger for a 
series of nationwide revolts 
the mutiny ended oct 6 when mutiny leader col alexander noble 
surrendered and was arrested

some people in this tiny town would 
like to forget it was the birthplace of the order a violent white 
supremacist group but selkirk high school language teacher eva 
gayle six wont let them 
for a student production she chose the foreigner a play 
poking fun at white supremacist beliefs 
if we can finally laugh at these foolish ideas that means the 
pain has passed mrs six said 
about 80 people a third of the towns population attended on 
opening night thursday she said 
it was an extremely receptive audience she said friday the 
threeday run ended saturday 
the order was founded in 1983 as a violent offshoot of the aryan 
nations sect near hayden lake idaho its members hoped to turn the 
northwest into a whitesonly bastion 
blamed for the machinegun slaying of denver radio host alan 
berg armoredcar robberies and other crimes the sect fell apart 
after leader robert mathews died in 1984 in a shootout with fbi 
agents several members have since been convicted of various 
crimes 
the foreigner is a 1983 farce about a shy englishman who 
pretends he cannot speak english while spending a few days at a 
backwater georgia fishing resort it pokes fun at the ku klux klan 
i dont think people could go to this play and not be reminded 
of the order because it really did happen mrs six said 
most people in this community of 250 in washingtons 
northeastern corner do not share the neonazi groups beliefs 
including mathews parents and two brothers 
his mother una mathews said a comedy about racism could help 
clear the air and improve the towns reputation 
theres nothing like poking fun at something to show the 
absurdity of it said mrs mathews she said she remains baffled 
by her sons actions 
others questioned the wisdom of reviving old controversies 
its over its done mayor lee teen mcgowan said 
nobody cares theyve forgotten about it 
if you want to come back in 20 years and dig it up ok but 
now the hurt is too recent 
other racist groups remain active in the pacific northwest and 
mathews has sympathizers in the area none protested at the play 
mrs six said 
i would not have done this play six years ago and maybe not 
even four years ago because there was too much pain she said 
but enough time has passed now that we can laugh at the stupidity 
of those ideas

iraq is capable of developing a nuclear bomb 
within three to five years and has between 10 and 30 chemical 
warheads for its ballistic missiles a respected israeli think tank 
says in a new report 
the assessment is based on iraqs possession of 26 pounds of 
enriched uranium that france supplied when it was assisting saddam 
husseins nuclear program said danny leshem of tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies which published 
the report sunday 
leshem said however that development of a nuclear warhead may 
take iraq until the end of the decade 
iraq has completed the development of chemical warheads and 
now they are starting production and equipment this is the 
beginning of the equipping stage leshem said on israel radio 
leshem said the iraqis have between 10 to 30 units that they 
perhaps can fire 
iraq he said has two missiles that can carry chemical 
warheads both modified versions of the soviet scud missile 
there is alhussein with a range of 600 to 650 kilometers 
370400 miles and alabbas with a range of 850 to 900 kilometers 
530560 miles alhussein was fired during the iraniraq war 
and alabbas is apparently entering into service this year 
leshem said 
iraq has repeatedly threatened to attack israel with chemical 
weapons in response to a us military move in the persian gulf 
crisis last month israel began distributing gas masks to its 47 
million citizens

gasoline at the pump got cheaper by nearly a 
penny a gallon in the past two weeks dropping to an average of 
just under 146 a national survey found 
this is the first significant change in the downward direction 
since the invasion of kuwait said oil analyst trilby lundberg 
whose biweekly lundberg survey of 13500 stations was released 
sunday 
the average for all grades of gasoline was 14598 a gallon a 
drop of 094 cents since the nov 2 survey 
the biggest reason for the drop is that crude oil price cuts 
have been working their way into the system ms lundberg said 
gasoline has gone up about 28 cents a gallon since the invasion 
aug 2 according to the survey

an insurance executive authorities 
thought faked his death to avoid prosecution and collect 4 million 
in insurance benefits was killed in a plane crash two years ago an 
autopsy confirmed 
a state medical examiner said dental records sunday proved the 
body recovered from lake martin on friday was that of 47yearold 
blan stewart of huntsville who disappeared while flying a small 
plane in 1988 
prosecutors had contended the insurance executive faked his 
death to collect some 4 million and to avoid prosecution on 
charges of stealing about 590000 from clients 
insurance companies had posted a 100000 reward for information 
on whether he was dead or alive 
the plane and stewarts body were found under 65 feet of water 
during a private search arranged by his widow sarah robin 
stewart 
he died of drowning and injuries suffered when the plane slammed 
into the lake said the medical examiner who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
i assume well close the book on the case said larry 
childers spokesman for the state attorney generals office 
once a death certificate is issued mrs stewart can start the 
process of collecting the insurance money said john heacock her 
attorney 
a judge in may had refused mrs stewarts attempt to have her 
husband declared dead the judge heard testimony from a man who 
claimed to have seen the plane flying low after air traffic 
controllers lost contact with stewart 
the attorney generals office had said at least two people 
claimed to have seen stewart in the virgin islands and south 
carolina long after he disappeared 
i have to assume like most do that people make mistakes

a 4yearold with a rare form of 
leukemia once considered incurable has apparently beaten the 
disease after being given a transfusion of umbilical cord blood 
from his baby sister doctors say 
michael sancilio of virginia beach left johns hopkins hospital 
in baltimore on saturday three months after becoming the first 
leukemia patient to undergo the experimental transplant 
although doctors are reluctant to say michael is cured 
michael appears to have defeated a rare form of leukemia for which 
previously existed no known cure virginia beach general hospital 
said in a statement 
doctors there had collected socalled stem cells from his 
sisters umbilical cord for transplant in baltimore umbilical 
blood usually discarded at birth is rich in stem cells which 
multiply rapidly to form bone marrow 
doctors gave michael five tablespoons of the blood within one 
month he began producing healthy bone marrow doctors said 
what we are viewing this afternoon is nothing short of a 
miracle dr leslie wasserman jr said sunday 
god deserves all the credit said michaels grandmother 
rachel sancilio i prayed for a miracle it was the most 
devastating thing my heart goes out to any family that has to go 
through something like this 
umbilical cord blood transplants have been performed three other 
times once in cincinnati and twice in france to treat a different 
disease fanconis anemia 
leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow eight months 
ago michael was diagnosed with a form known as chronic myelogenous 
leukemia which cannot be controlled with drugs and usually kills 
within a year of diagnosis 
the boys sister christina was born may 1 michaels blood 
type did not match hers but the siblings were otherwise 
compatible and doctors found that he was not overly likely to 
reject the umbilical cord blood 
because of the procedure michael has another chance at life 
and a new blood type the hospital said 
doctors will not know for about two years whether the boy is 
cured christina is healthy

president bush demanded today that iraqs saddam 
hussein turn tail 180 degrees and withdraw from kuwait british 
prime minister margaret thatcher said saddam has to be removed by 
force unless he pulls out soon 
the two leaders meeting over breakfast before a 34nation 
summit underscored their hardline stand against iraqs aggression 
the president also dismissed saddams proposal to begin 
releasing foreign hostages beginning on christmas this cynicism 
of starting to release them on christmas day will be seen by the 
world as a total ploy bush said 
opening a joint news conference with mrs thatcher bush said 
not surprisingly we see eye to eye on the gulf 
for her part thatcher accused saddam of the worst brutality 
and evil 
the only way to avoid a shooting war in the persian gulf she 
said would be for saddam hussein to withdraw quickly 
totally 
most people understand evil has to be stopped either he 
withdraws or the military option has to be used the prime

alone in the middle east 
she said she and bush see eyetoeye on the persian gulf and the 
need to use force to drive saddam from kuwait if he does not 
withdraw unconditionally 
there can be no compromise mrs thatcher said you cannot 
reward aggression 
bush said he hoped discuss the persian gulf when he meets later 
today with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
asked why gorbachev seemed to me more optimistic about a 
peaceful resolution of the situation than he was bush said 
i will be seeing him and mr gorbachev has been very solid in 
support of the united nations so im anxious to know if theres 
something new that hes thinking of 
he said the reduction of tensions in europe between superpowers 
will help send an even stronger signal to saddam of allied unity to 
drive him from kuwait 
youve heard prime minister thatcher bush said i feel 
the same way 
the longer he focuses on holding innocents against their will 
the more he points to his own brutality bush said 
there will be no concession bush said we are ratcheting 
up pressure on this man and i hope that as soon as he understands 
that he cannot prevail that he will do that which he did in 
iranturn tail 180 degrees and turn east 
he was referring to iraqs withdrawal from iran as the beginning 
of the current confrontation with the west bush added that saddam 
now should turn 180 degrees and head north out of kuwait 
meanwhile bush was asked about mrs thatchers challenge from 
within her own conservative party in british elections on tuesday 
i stay out of all this but we have a superb relationship with 
mrs thatcher he said asked if she would survive the challenge 
mrs thatcher said i most earnestly believe so

the armsreduction treaty signed today by leaders 
of the eastern and western military alliances would slash 
nonnuclear forces in europe and eliminate the cold war fear of a 
surprise ground attack 
negotiators sought in vain for 15 years to make headway on the 
conventional forces in europe treaty but swiftly concluded it over 
the past 20 months as the soviet military empire collapsed 
we are putting an end to the previous age french president 
francois mitterrand said in signing the accord before a glittering 
assembly of presidents premiers and foreign ministers at the 
elysee palace 
nato and warsaw pact negotiators initialed the 160page document 
in vienna on sunday clearing the way for president bush soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and other leaders to sign the accord at 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
under the treaty more than 100000 pieces of military hardware 
would be scrapped prompting some to call the pact the formal end 
of the cold war 
no battle in the history of mankind destroyed such an 
immense number of tanks armored combat vehicles artillery and 
combat aircraft soviet negotiator oleg a grinevsky told 
reporters in vienna 
us negotiator james woolsey said the accord makes it a 
matter of many many months instead of a few hours in which any 
country could think of a surprise attack 
the agreement sets no limits on combat troops because the 
reunification of germany and the disintegration of the warsaw pact 
outpaced the talks negotiators are to reconvene nov 29 to discuss 
troop levels 
most of the 16 nations of the north atlantic treaty organization 
and six countries in the warsaw pact already have taken advantage 
of the reduced tensions to cut their armed forces bush last month 
announced plans to withdraw 40000 us troops from europe and 
later ordered an additional 100000 moved to saudi arabia cutting 
the american ground force level on the continent by half 
because most of the troops and armaments in europe were under 
kremlin control the warsaw pact will register the first financial 
benefits 
gorbachev has presented the supreme soviet with a 10year plan 
to make the military less of a burden on the state and more 
efficient at the same time soviet chief of staff mikhail 
moiseyev said in an article published by the army newspaper 
krasnaya zvezda 
the massive disarmament will be carried out under the cfe treaty 
and the proposed strategic force reduction treaty to cut nuclear 
arsenals by up to 50 percent moiseyev said 
under the conventional force treaty the nations will have 40 
months after the last nation ratifies the accord to destroy the 
specified weapons 
from the start of the cold war and the birth of nato in 1949 and 
the warsaw pact in 1955 the military landscape of western europe 
has been dominated by fear of a communist bloc ground assault 
to eliminate that the treaty limiting the weapons of 22 
countries from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains requires 
the soviets to drastically reduce their forces including 
tanks from about 41000 before the treaty negotiations began 
to 13150 moscow already has reduced its tank holdings in the 
territory covered by the treaty to about 21000 mainly by moving 
its best models east 
the allowable number tanks for all of eastern europe will be 
20000 the united states and its nato allies also will be allowed 
20000 tanks that will require a cut of about 4000 for nato 
although more than 1000 of the topoftheline us m1a1 tanks 
already are being moved to saudi arabia 
armored combat vehicles from the 32300 now deployed by the 
soviets to 30000 nato will not have to make any cuts in this 
category 
artillery pieces providing the essential firepower for a 
combat operation from about 52000 for the soviets before the 
negotiations to 13175 the soviets already are down to 18300 
nato will stay at 18500 
those three weapon categories tanks armored combat vehicles 
and artillery are especially important to the military balance in 
europe because they form the core of nonnuclear offense for both 
the soviets and nato

researchers have developed a blood test 
to distinguish sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome or yuppie 
flu from those feeling rundown for other reasons a scientist 
says 
the test checks levels of white blood cells aids researcher jay 
levy said sunday at a national conference on the chronic fatigue 
syndrome he led the group that developed the test at the 
university of california at san francisco 
levy said most of the 120 chronic fatigue patients tested at the 
university had abnormal levels of three types of white blood cells 
produced when the body fights a virus 
no one virus was present in all the patients but levy said 
levels of those three cells were either consistently high or 
consistently low in most of the patients 
therefore he said a check of those white blood cells plus a 
review of the patients medical history could determine whether a 
person has chronic fatigue syndrome none of the 80 healthy people 
studied had abnormal levels levy said 
chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by exhaustion joint 
and muscle aches fever and other problems that persist for more 
than six months and often for years its cause is unknown 
tens of thousands of americans believe they have chronic fatigue 
syndrome although the extent of it is unclear it was dubbed 
yuppie flu because it has been widely reported among 
welleducated women in their 30s and 40s 
the weekend conference titled unraveling the mystery drew 
400 eople including researchers and people afflicted with the 
ailment 
most researchers now agree the illness stems from immune system 
abnormalities not depression or other psychological factors levy 
said 
he called it the disease of the 90s 
this is going to be the 10 years that we see the greatest 
advancement in understanding this disease he said 
he suggested the name be changed to chronic immune activation 
syndrome because research indicates that patients immune systems 
are chronically activated as if fighting a continuing viral 
infection 
with most viral infections such as the flu the immune system 
fights vigorously causing fatigue and muscle aches but it quiets 
down when the virus is killed in chronic fatigue syndrome the 
immune system stays on the attack causing the symptoms to persist 
he said 
besides trying to determine the cause researchers are 
struggling to learn how the illness is transmitted and whether it 
is contagious 
dr walter gunn a researcher with the centers for disease 
control in atlanta said an interagency committee had been formed 
to determine the extent of the illness

president bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev joined european leaders today in signing a historic 
treaty that cuts conventional forces in europe and pushes the cold 
war deeper into history 
it is the farthestreaching arms agreement in history and it 
signals the new world order that is emerging bush said in a 
glittering signing ceremony 
the longsought agreement to destroy tens of thousands of tanks 
artillery and armored combat vehicles in europe is the most 
sweeping arms accord in history it was signed as prelude to a 
34nation summit originally called to discuss european security in 
the post cold war era but shadowed by the persian gulf crisis 
we are putting an end to the previous age french president 
francois mitterrand declared as he put his signature to the treaty 
documents one by one the other leaders followed suit with 
gorbachev the last one to wield the pen as the treaty was passed 
back to mitterrand the roomful of leaders applauded their work 
this reduces to practically nil the tensions that have 
existed said bush 
french foreign minister roland dumas described the meeting as 
the most important international event since world war ii and said 
it will design the architecture of europe for the century to 
come 
us officials view the summit more modestly describing the 
34nation forum primarily as a device for promoting political 
freedom human rights and eastwest cooperation 
with the extraordinary assembly of government leaders french 
authorities mobilized rooftop sharpshooters antiterrorist units 
and 10000 police officers to provide security and also to clear 
paths for convoys of limousines parisians braced for severe 
traffic disruptions 
domestic political crises faced by some leaders offered a 
dramatic sideshow gorbachev left behind a country staggering under 
political and economic chaos prime ministers margaret thatcher of 
britain and michel rocard of france face parliament votes that 
conceivably could topple them during the summit 
yet the gathering gave bush an opportunity to exercise his 
personal diplomacy to solidify support for his persian gulf 
policies officials said the president would seek backing for a 
united nations resolution authorizing military action to force iraq 
out of kuwait 
bush and thatcher emerged from a breakfast meeting today warning 
that fighting might erupt unless iraqs saddam hussein withdraws 
from kuwait 
bush demanded that saddam turn tail 180 degrees and mrs 
thatcher said the iraqi president has to be removed by force 
unless he pulls out soon 
at a joint news conference with the british prime minister bush 
said not surprisingly we see eye to eye on the gulf 
the threeday summit will end wednesday with the signing of an 
agreement to institute highlevel political consultations of the 34 
nations and establish a conflict prevention center in vienna 
afterward bush will fly to the middle east for a thanksgiving day 
visit with us troops in saudi arabia 
on sunday bush conferred with french president francois 
mitterrand and german chancellor helmut kohl both of whom stress a 
nonmilitary outcome to the gulf crisis 
yet secretary of state james a baker iii said many countries 
support a military option if iraq does not withdraw voluntarily 
im not aware of any countries going back to the very 
beginning of this crisis who have taken the position under any and 
all circumstances that the option of force should be ruled out 
baker said 
bush visiting with kohl said were not ruling out any 
options were not ruling any options in the chancellor urged 
that everything be exhausted that there is to exhaust with 
negotiations 
baker met sunday with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze afterward both declined to say whether the soviet 
union would back a united nations resolution authorizing the use of 
force against iraq 
gorbachev said sunday that new ideas are emerging to avert 
war the soviet leader in rome to visit pope john paul ii did not 
elaborate 
bush hopscotching from czechoslovakia to germany to france 
said the arms agreement he was signing today seems to be 
overshadowed by whats happening in the gulf but it is a 
significant milestone 
his assessment paled beside that of oleg a grinevsky soviet 
ambassador to the talks 
from this treaty the soviet union is ceasing to become a 
militarized state with all the consequences of that economic 
political and social grinevsky said 
the treaty on nonnuclear forces was initialed in vienna on 
sunday by negotiators from the 16member nato alliance and the 
sixmember warsaw pact which is rapidly disintegrating as a 
military alliance 
the 160page accord limits each side to 20000 main battle 
tanks 30000 armored combat vehicles 20000 artillery pieces 
6800 fighter planes and 2000 combat helicopters it will cover a 
25 million square mile area stretching from the atlantic ocean to 
the ural mountains in the soviet union 
the accord also regulates troop movements from both alliances 
and permits mutual inspections across europe 
because of the soviets big edge in conventional weapons moscow 
will have to destroy many more weapons than the nato alliance

the army had sent 20yearold pvt alfred edwin escquibel from a 
desk job to fort campbell ky for rifle drills shortly after 
denying his request for conscientious objector last month 
when an instructor ordered him last week to pick up an m16 
rifle i told her my story and said with all due respect 
maam i cant do that the soldier said in a telephone 
interview sunday from fort campbell 
the helicopter mechanic was demoted from private first class to 
private 2 during a hearing at fort campbell on saturday 
he was ordered to forfeit 405 a month in pay for two months 
confined to his barracks for 30 days and sentenced to extra duty 
for refusing the order 
esquibel a roman catholic from albuquerque said he told his 
m16 instructor that for religious and moral reasons he could not 
bear arms 
i felt like the only reason they were sending me down there 
to fort campbell was to get me in trouble esquibel said i 
think they mightve thought to themselves lets see how sincere 
he is 
the soldier said he filed a request last week for discharge on 
grounds of erroneous enlistment he said he was assured he 
would not be ordered to pick up a weapon until his request for 
discharge is either denied or approved 
esquibels unit has been shipped to the persian gulf as part of 
the us buildup there 
esquibel who enlisted in 1989 said he told his recruiter of 
his objection to guns and was assured he would be assigned a 
noncombat role after basic training 
the soldier said he filed for conscientious objector status in 
august 1989 after realizing he would be required to use a weapon

between 12875 yen and 12917 yen the dollar had edged up a total 
of 096 yen in the three previous trading days 
dealers said the dollar was being sold in early trading on news 
that the federal reserve eased interest rates friday and that iraq 
had offered to free all remaining foreign hostages 
lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to 
investors in addition the dollars role as a safe haven in times 
of international tension would be diminished by peaceful moves by 
iraq 
the official iraqi news agency said sunday the captives held in 
iraq would be allowed to depart beginning dec 25 if nothing mars 
the atmosphere of peace the bush administration has dismissed 
the offer as a ploy 
the dollar rebounded later dealers said the iraqi news was not 
considered sufficient to trigger major dollar selling and the 
interest rate easing had been anticipated 
some 848 billion changed hands in spot trading up from 597 
billion friday 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which had shed 
31585 points friday gained 34653 or 150 percent closing at

news of the iraqi move to free hostages turned out to be a 
good factor in the market said nobuyuki fujimoto an analyst 
with nikko securities 
but fujimoto added that it was hard to say whether the market 
had gained confidence the recent pattern has been a gain early in 
the week followed by declines later in the week

demonstrators angered by rationing and 
shortages are rallying behind opposition leaders who have told 
socialist premier andrei lukanov to resign by thursday or face 
general unrest 
but lukanov said leaving office under pressure would be a 
betrayal of democracy there have been two attempted attacks on 
lukanovs home recently 
on sunday about 70000 protesters outside alexander nevsky 
cathedral cheered wildly as opposition leaders issued the thursday 
deadline for the leader of the longruling party and his government 
to step down 
the socialist party was created last spring when the communist 
party dissolved and renamed itself after the november ouster of 
hardline leader todor zhivkov 
the socialists won a parliamentary majority in junes free 
elections with promises to abandon marxism but the lukanov 
government has proven ineffective and his popularity has slumped 
with bulgarias economic performance 
the governments oneyear credit is up it is now time for 
action petar beron leader of the main opposition union of 
democratic forces told the crowd on sunday 
he promised a showdown in the 400seat grand national assembly 
on thursday when a controversial budget reform package is put forth 
by the socialists 
we will wait no longer we will vote against the 
governments budget draft beron shouted from the cathedral 
steps 
the crowd had jeered and whistled when he called for patience 
and a parliamentary solution they yelled general strike and 
death to the communist party 
if the government doesnt resign on thursday the socialists 
fate is in your hands beron told the crowd 
lukanov has pinned his political fate to the budget package 
which includes sharp price rises on 21 basic goods at a time when 
sofia stores are bare and electricity gasoline and some foodstuffs 
are rationed 
despite his majority in parliament lukanov has urged also 
opposition support for the reforms citing their national 
importance the premier is under increasing pressure from street 
protests and from some factions within socialist ranks 
the opposition coalition is calling for a higher budget deficit 
instead of higher prices that could tax bulgarias consumers 
lukanov claims more government debt would devastate bulgarias 
national economy already saddled by an 11 billion foreign debt 
that it is having difficulty repaying 
the union of democratic forces claims it would triumph if new 
elections were held

tales of fear hunger and a fading resistance in 
kuwait accompanied a group of former hostages who arrived on a 
uschartered flight from iraq today leaving many family members 
behind 
some of the passengers said kuwaitis and foreigners are well 
aware of the military buildup in the persian gulf and hope for an 
invasion 
people are starving and they need food but people who have 
food are frightened of giving it to them because they would be 
accused as collaborators said an american woman who believes her 
husband is still hiding somewhere in kuwait 
we prayed every night that we would wake up in the morning 
she said 
the 136 passengers who arrived at londons gatwick airport early 
today had been in kuwait since the aug 2 iraqi invasion they 
included 75 americans mainly of arab descent or married to arabs 
a number of women carried babies and were draped in gray 
blankets over lightweight clothes most passengers would not talk 
to reporters because they feared for relatives left behind 
the time has come to give these people the kuwaitis their 
right to freedom all we have heard of is the peaceful solution we 
are tired of that said the american woman 
salameh salen 31 a jordanianborn american said the kuwaiti 
resistance to iraqi forces had been fairly strong but is now 
dwindling 
a palestinian doctor who said he had six children living in 
maryland and had been working in kuwait described the iraqi troops 
as tough and said the resistance appeared to be almost 
collapsing 
after the invasion he said he had been able to go out to wait 
in line for food at home he passed the time listening to the 
radio following developments via the bbc news 
gatwick officials said the passengers included 12 canadians 12 
britons 10 new zealanders eight germans seven irish six 
australians two danes two south africans one polish woman and a 
french citizen 
we all went through situations where we didnt know if we 
would get out particularly in the early days of the invasion and 
the disorder and looting said new zealander alastair lane 
he said many reports of iraqi abuses in kuwait were true but 
some were exaggerated 
iraqi troops 90 percent of the time are pretty good lane 
said 
the british and the us cant go outside theyve been inside 
for three and a half months some are probably at the end of their 
tether they cant keep their lights on at night they cant even 
go out of their front door lane said 
lane von wessel a dutchborn new zealander said the brits 
britons are the worst off because prime minister margaret 
thatcher talks too much on tv when she talks about the butcher of 
baghdad that annoys those people 
von wessel said it was possible to buy food if you have 
money 
douglas moore a british soccer coach who worked in kuwait for 
the past four years said he spent more than two months in hiding 
with very little food 
i switched addresses five times to avoid the iraqis who were 
searching everywhere moore said

the greetings sent by governorelect lawton chiles or the 
tapedelayed phone call from reagan 
reportedly she had something else on her mind 
mrs white had been unhappy all day sunday according to a 
nurses aide because she had to wait until the party for a piece 
of the cake but once the cake was cut she livened up 
shes wide awake now said paul allen owner and 
administrator of putnam memorial nursing home 
while hundreds of wellwishers gathered around mrs white she

american university hasnt recovered yet from 
the uproar over former president richard berendzens guilty plea to 
making obscene phone calls now theres a new dispute over news he 
is being offered 1 million to sever his university ties 
a firestorm of protests erupted this month when reports surfaced 
that the university board of trustees had agreed to make the offer 
some students and faculty vowed to get the offer rescinded 
provost milton greenberg and edward r carr chairman of the 
board of trustees met with student leaders friday and planned to 
meet with key faculty members today 
berendzen 51 who has continued to draw his annual salary of 
about 140000 since resigning as president in april has not been 
available for comment 
i have been notified by many members of the au community that 
the information reported concerning dr berendzens settlement 
package has resulted in campuswide frustration carr said in a 
open letter last week 
carrs letter acknowledged that many believe the decision to 
offer the settlement did not adequately take into consideration 
the input of campus constituencies and further concern is also 
motivated over the magnitude of dr berendzens reported settlement 
package 
berendzen resigned last spring as fairfax county va police 
conducted an investigation of complaints that he made a series of 
obscene telephone calls to susan allen who ran a day care service 
berendzen checked himself into a sexual disorders clinic at 
johns hopkins university in baltimore 
in may he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges and fairfax 
county general district court judge j conrad waters jr sentenced 
him to 30 days in jail on each charge waters suspended all of the 
jail time provided berendzen stays out of trouble for one year and 
continues treatment 
valerie b morris head of the university senate said friday 
there is a question of whether berendzen still retains his tenured 
physics professorship 
if he did then theres a procedure to follow she said if 
he sought to negotiate a severance morris said i can guarantee 
you that the amount at the end of the procedure wouldnt be 
approximating the 680000 weve heard is the amount the board 
negotiated other reports said the board had offered 1 million 
under most circumstances morris said a tenured professor who 
voluntarily leaves gets nothing you resign and go she said 
that in a few cases the university will buy out a contract usually 
paying a years salary 
a letter to berendzen spearheaded by professor sanford ungar and 
signed by 84 faculty members said the university withstood a 
great trauma last april the reports of your proposed 
milliondollar settlement have caused the anguish of last spring to 
return to our community 
while the faculty supported berendzens efforts to settle his 
contract with the university the letter said we do however 
question your request for a settlement beyond the contracted 
severance 
the letter urged berendzen to contact the appropriate 
committee if he believes he has tenure and wants to keep teaching 
physics or sever any remaining employment relationship with the 
university without insisting on further compensation 
a key argument among students is that american university 
depends so heavily on student tuition about 89 percent of the 
budget that students should be guaranteed a voice 
the graduate student council in a letter to carr noted the 
university has trouble paying for things such as student financial 
aid library improvements and faculty and staff salary increases 
the universitys small endowment makes it even more 
astonishing that the board of trustees would consider stripping our 
institution of such an amount of money to remunerate a single 
individual said the letter 
however samer farha a senior from beirut is convinced that 
most students want berendzen to return to campus as a professor 
i would love to take a class with him farha added i 
think hes done an amazing job for the university bringing it from 
where it was to where it is now 
adam hartzell a high point nc junior who is vice president 
of the student confederation said berendzen should not return 
i think it would just further divide the community and thats 
not what i want right now he said id rather have an au that 
comes together again

ukrainian authorities relinquished land to crimean 
tatars after they occupied a government building on the west coast 
of the crimean peninsula a newspaper reported today 
the communist party newspaper pravda used the incident last week 
to illustrate that no resettlement program exists for the crimean 
tatars who were expelled from the black sea peninsula by stalin 
and now are returning to their traditional lands 
pravda said 46 crimean tatars took part in the sitin at 
yevpatoriya city hall they demanded that the nearby area of 
ismailbey already home to tatar squatters be given to them 
pravda said 
police later sealed off the building a move the tatars 
interpreted as a prelude to violence and 100 more tatars gathered 
with gasoline bombs nov 11 the newspaper reported 
the situation was defused when representatives of the ukrainian 
government and the soviet parliament intervened and it was decided 
to give the tatars the 163 acres of land they were demanding the 
newspaper said 
pravda did not say when the protest began or when it ended 
the tatars of the crimea were resettled in siberia and central 
asia during world war ii when josef stalin expelled several 
peoples from their homelands on the grounds they could not be 
trusted to occupy strategic areas 
the tatars among other ethnic groups long have been agitating 
to return in 1989 the supreme soviet legislature declared that 
all peoples exiled under stalin should be considered politically 
rehabilitated 
however other people now occupy the lands and houses of the 
exiles 
several thousand tatars have returned to the crimea in recent 
years last month authorities began preventing more tatars from 
settling in the area after clashes between tatars and other 
residents 
tent camps in the crimea house more than 2500 tatars the 
independent interfax news agency reported 
after crimean tatars were allowed to return to the peninsula 
no one took the trouble to set up a resettlement mechanism 
pravda said it is still unclear how many people want to change 
their places of residence and the areas where the outcasts will 
settle have not been determined 
this is why chaos reigns in the crimea it continued 
groups of tatars arbitrarily seize farmland areas and partition 
cultivated fields provoking discontent among those who use this 
land 
ethnographers estimate there are 500000 crimean tatars in the 
soviet union and another 1 million in turkey the crimean tatars 
protests near the kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return 
home were among the first tests of president mikhail s gorbachevs 
promises of greater democracy

egypt accused shamir of expansionist intentions and the 
opposition labor party said fresh controversy over shamirs remark 
could interfere with a wave of soviet immigration 
shamirs comment was similar to a statement in january that set 
off an international protest 
at that time he told a party gathering that for a large 
immigration we need the land of israel a large and strong israel 
we will need a lot of place to absorb everybody 
palestinian and arab leaders immediately launched a campaign to 
block immigration of thousands of soviet jews the arabs fear the 
immigrants will displace palestinians in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
israel captured the territories in the 1967 middle east war from 
jordan and egypt palestinians have been waging a nearly threeyear 
uprising aimed at freeing the land from israeli control 
the united states has repeatedly called for a landforpeace 
settlement in the region and has insisted on israeli guarantees 
that usbacked loans for the soviet immigrants not be used in the 
occupied lands or arab east jerusalem 
shamir was quoted by israel radio as telling a sunday memorial 
service for deceased likud politicians the party leaders left us 
a clear message to keep the land of israel from the sea to the 
jordan river for future generations and for the mass immigration 
and for the jewish people most of whom will be gathered into this 
country 
after the speech shamir denied he was returning to his earlier 
theme of a greater israel which would include the occupied 
territories to accommodate the thousands of arriving soviet jews 
israeli newspapers said at least 120000 soviet jews have arrived 
so far this year and a million are expected by the end of 1992 
there is no connection whatever between our maintaining the 
territorial integrity of eretz israel the land of israel between 
the sea and the jordan river which is a vital security necessity 
for the state of israel and the mass immigration which is the 
fulfillment of the great zionist dream the jerusalem post quoted 
him as saying 
in cairo egyptian foreign minister ismat abdelmeguid ordered 
israels ambassador to explain shamirs remark his ministry issued 
a statement saying 
egypt rejects in its totality shamirs comments which 
indicate his expansionist intention to occupy territories belonging 
to someone else and this cannot help reach a peaceful settlement to 
the palestinian issue 
chaim ramon head of the labor party faction in parliament 
criticized shamirs comment on israel radio i am calling on the 
prime minister to be quiet for heavens sake he is risking the 
chances of immigration ramon said he was apparently referring 
to the controversy that erupted over shamirs earlier comments 
in the past shamir has sometimes made strong statements 
followed quickly by a clarification 
in august the prime minister hinted in a speech to american 
jewish contributors that israel would consider a preemptive strike 
on iraq 
in the circumstances our major task is to prevent war or to 
preempt it and if heaven forbid these two fail and there is no 
alternative we have to win quickly and decisively he said in 
his speech 
questioned later by reporters shamir denied israel was 
considering a preemptive strike

government plotted to kill dissident writer adam michnik during the 
late 1970s according to a report today in the newspaper he now 
edits 
michnik was the target of operation drone linked with a 
wideranging theft and corruption plot known as the iron affair 
gazeta wyborcza said 
the newspaper polands largest published excerpts of reports 
on the operation compiled in 1984 during an internal interior 
ministry investigation 
michnik 44 is a leading solidarity movement theoretician and a 
widely published essayist in poland and abroad 
an opposition activist from his university days in the 1960s he 
went to paris in 1976 at the invitation of existentialist writer 
jeanpaul sartre and was jailed for several months shortly after 
his return in may 1977

boris n yeltsin president of the largest soviet 
republic demanded today that mikhail s gorbachev consult with 
leaders of the republics before implementing his plan to reorganize 
the national government 
in his first public comment on the soviet presidents proposals 
yeltsin told the independent interfax news agency that he found 
some of them disappointing but did not specify which ones he 
said he needed to study the proposals thoroughly 
my attitude toward them is not that simple said yeltsin 
president of the russian republic who is gorbachevs political 
rival and frequent critic 
in an effort to break what is being called a paralysis of 
power between the central government and the soviet unions 
splintering republics gorbachev on saturday proposed dumping his 
embattled prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov revamping the 
executive branch and putting it entirely under his control the 
soviet parliament gave initial approval to the proposals which 
included putting representatives of each republic on a main 
governing council 
getting rid of ryzhkov and his council of ministers or cabinet 
has been one of yeltsins demands and some of gorbachevs 
proposals seemed to be a concession to the russian president 
the presidents suggestions are all aimed at strengthening the 
center yeltsin told interfax 
he said the soviet leader apparently ignored suggestions from 
leaders of the sovereign republics before making the proposals 
yeltsin criticized gorbachev for proposing the restructuring 
without consulting the republics and said such a decisionmaking 
process is unacceptable to russia 
he said the questions involved are not political these are 
questions of interethnic relations 
before making such a decision the president should have 
consulted with the leadership of all sovereign republics 
interfax quoted him as saying and this never has been done that 
means that again knowing that the republics wont approve of it 
they want to push it forward but their reaction will be 
opposite 
in an apparent reference to the political stalemate that exists 
between the central government and the 15 republics yeltsin said 
i am even convinced that all this will only make the situation in 
the country worse rather than improve it 
yeltsin and even gorbachev have referred to this government 
crisis as a paralysis of power laws implemented by the central 
government are being ignored or overridden by many soviet 
republics which are seeking greater sovereignty and say their own 
measures take precedence over those coming from the kremlin 
gorbachev urged the council of ministers be replaced by several 
bodies under direct presidential control the principal ruling body 
would be the federation council created in march as a presidential 
advisory body but which would now be expanded to iclude 
representatives of the soviet republics 
gorbachev also suggested naming a vice president forming an 
interrepublican committee under the federation council a 
national security council and a presidential body to coordinate the 
activities of law enforcement agencies including sending 
representatives to regions 
radical legislators generally gave qualified support to the 
proposals although some said gorbachev was trying to grab too much 
power and others said he did not go far enough in giving the 
republics full independence parliament will take final action on 
it friday 
grigory yavlinsky deputy prime minister of the russian republic 
and coauthor with stanislav shatalin of the radical 500day 
economic reform program also gave a somewhat positive assessment 
of gorbachevs proposals he said in an interview with the tass 
news agency that gorbachevs plans and yeltsins suggestion of a 
coalition government are not incompatible 
the soviet press on sunday generally praised the speech

allegations that texas aampm researchers spiked 
water with tritium to fake cold nuclear fusion are apparently 
unfounded an internal panel said 
the panel in a report dated oct 15 and released by the 
university sunday recommended that investigations into the charges 
be dropped it said the researchers whose work was questioned may 
have acted hastily but did not do severely substandard work 
the report was written by three texas aampm professors assigned to 
investigate the research at texas that followed the march 1989 
claim by scientists in utah that they had achieved cold fusion in a 
beaker of roomtemperature water 
such a discovery would create a cheap clean and virtually 
inexhaustible supply of energy 
scientists all over the world rushed to confirm the discovery by 
b stanley pons of the university of utah and his british 
colleague martin fleischmann 
but the journal science suggested in its june 15 1989 issue 
that some aampm experiments had been tainted 
one such experiment conducted by aampm electrochemist john 
omalley bockris involved running a series of electrolytic cells 
modeled after those in utah some cells sporadically produced 
tritium a standard byproduct of nuclear fusion the experiment was 
the strongest evidence anywhere for cold fusion 
but critics questioned the results saying the tritium was not 
accompanied by other fusion byproducts and suggested the 
experiment had been spiked with tritium 
the report issued sunday concluded that spiking was unlikely in 
part because scientists got different results when they tested the 
spiking theory by intentionally putting tritium in water 
while it is not possible for us to categorically exclude 
spiking as a possibility it is our opinion that possibility is 
much less probable than that of inadvertent contamination or other 
unexplained factors in the measurements the report said 
the report said that in general the furor over the alleged 
discovery of cold fusion caused scientists at texas aampm to rush 
their research and lose scientific objectivity but concluded that 
none of the experiments was conducted fraudulently 
the earliest attempts to reproduce those experiments were done 
hastily using available material and improvised setups where 
necessary the report said this coupled with the perceived 
pressures of racing against other groups certainly led to some 
less than perfect experimental design 
but the report added that even in their haste researchers 
maintained generally normal standards it also said that with the 
decreasing amount of attention continuing research is being 
conducted properly 
the aampm report noted that researchers are still trying to 
confirm pons and fleischmanns discovery but so far have failed 
leaving the general scientific community skeptical that the two 
actually achieved cold fusion 
the internal report was written by john poston a nuclear 
engineer edward s fry a physicist and joseph b natowitz a 
chemist

republics communist party and federal premier ante markovics 
alliance of reform forces 
with 15 percent of the vote counted in the central republic the 
serbian party was ahead in three of bosnias seven constituencies 
the croats and the moslems were leading in two each 
the 240 seats in bosnias bicameral parliament are divided among 
the seven constituencies final results were not expected for 
several days 
the communists were rejected in bosnias elections because of 
the disastrous consequences of their 45 years of monopoly on 
power said radovan karadzic president of the serbian democratic 
alliance this is a victory for democracy 
zlatko lajundzia a member of the communist partys presidium 
said it is obvious that the nationalist parties are doing much 
better than we and they had expected 
preelection polls had shown the communists and markovics 
reformists well ahead the two parties had claimed victory for a 
nationalist party could lead to civil war 
western observers said the elections in which about 70 percent 
of the electorate cast ballots were free and generally fair 
except for some isolated incidences in general the elections 
seem to have been carried out fairly said david evans a senior 
adviser for a us congressional commission monitoring human rights 
and security in europe 
bosniahercegovina whose 42 million people include serbs 
croats and moslems is geographically and politically at the heart 
of yugoslavias bitter rivalries 
sarajevo bosnias capital is best known for the assassination 
of austrohungarian archduke franz ferdinand by a young nationalist 
in 1914 that killing sparked world war i 
serbia and croatia are the two largest yugoslav republics and 
they flank bosniahercegovina they have previously made 
territorial claims on bosnia

federal capital croatia where the croatian democratic union 
defeated the communists in spring elections wants yugoslavia to 
become a confederation of nearly independent states

hostility has existed among the moslems the mainly roman 
catholic croats and the orthodox serbs since yugoslavia was founded 
as a kingdom in 1918 during the nazi occupation of world war ii 
bosnia was the scene of a civil war among croats serbs communists

build new partnerships and extend to each other the hand of 
friendship the document also asserted that the countries have an 
obligation and commitment to refrain from the threat or use of 
force against each other

the minds of many leaders 
in his speech bush saluted those who have made it possible for 
europe to end decades of repression to rediscover their 
birthright of freedom 
in hailing the convention arms treaty he also looked ahead to 
an open skies agreement permitting reconnaissance flights to 
check compliance with arms agreements 
then he took an abrupt rhetorical turn to the persian gulf 
where he said the principles of democracy and freedom that guide 
the new europe have been violated recalling that he and 
gorbachev issued a joint call last fall for an iraqi withdrawal 
bush said can there be room for any other viewthese 
principles have no geographic limits 
gorbachev looked ahead to negotiations still to come he said 
the soviet union is willing to begin negotiations on reducing 
arsenals of short range nuclear weapons within a month or two 
instead of military force our world order will be based on 
equitable dialogue he said

gorbachev who permitted democracy to come to the former soviet

accords 
french president francois mitterrand the host had been the 
first and when the documents were passed back to him the leaders 
applauded their work we are putting an end to the previous 
age he said 
with the extraordinary assembly of government leaders french 
authorities mobilized rooftop sharpshooters antiterrorist units 
and 10000 police officers to provide security and also to clear 
paths for convoys of limousines parisians braced for severe 
traffic disruptions 
the leaders of the nato members six warsaw pact countries and 
12 neutral nations proceeded from versailles to the kleber 
international conference center to officially open the threeday 
summit on european security 
our meeting today marks the end of an an epoch and thereby a 
beginning said mitterrand in the opening speech it is the 
first time in history that we witness a change in depth of our 
landscape which is not the outcome of a war or bloody revolution 
 
even as the leaders met to discuss peace in europe their 
attention was diverted to the persian gulf where an international 
force of hundreds of thousands of troops is stationed to counter 
iraqs saddam hussein 
officials said bush would seek backing for a united nations 
resolution authorizing military action to force iraq out of kuwait 
in another round of diplomacy bush planned to meet over dinner 
with gorbachev their fourth meeting in less than a year the 
persian gulf was one likely topic of discussion another was us 
assistance to the embattled soviet leader struggling against 
economic difficulties 
we would always be openminded on humanitarian aid if theres 
a real need there bush said

president bush and mikhail gorbachev led european 
leaders today in signing a historic treaty that slashes nonnuclear 
weapons in europe and pushes the cold war deeper into history 
what a long way the world has come exulted the soviet leader 
scarcely had the accord been signed when bush sought to cement 
european support for the continued effort to force iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait our success here can be neither profound 
nor enduring if the rule of law is shamelessly disregarded 
elsewhere he said in a speech to a 34nation summit called to 
discuss european security in the post cold war era 
gorbachev followed bush to the podium and he too blended 
words of praise for eastwest cooperation in europe with the need 
to halt iraqs aggression 
were prepared to show patience in the quest for a political 
solution but we remain firm and determined in implementing the will 
of the united nations which has demanded iraqs withdrawal he 
said 
the two men spoke after a glittering signing ceremony in an 
ornate ballroom at the elysee palace the longsought agreement to 
destroy tens of thousands of tanks artillery and armored combat 
vehicles in europe is the most sweeping arms accord in history it 
will alter the military balance in europe by erasing moscows 
ability to mass huge numbers of tanks and other heavy armor in

an appeals court today gave ordinary criminal 
courts jurisdiction to try a former french official accused of 
sending 194 jewish children to their deaths in concentration camps 
during world war ii 
the paris court of appeals overturned a lower court ruling last 
month rene bousquet could only be tried by the high court of the 
liberation formed in 1944 to prosecute officials of the 
collaborationist vichy government the court has been defunct for 
decades 
court of appeals president albert moatty ruled today that the 
length of time required to reconstitute the court could preclude 
justice in the case of bousquet who is 81 
with moattys ruling state prosecutors can resume their 
investigation of evidence on bousquets case that was provided by 
nazi hunters 
bousquet headed the national police during the nazi occupation 
of france state prosecutors in september asked that he be 
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 jewish 
children during the war 
should the case go to trial bousquet would be the 
highestranking official of the vichy government to be tried for 
crimes against humanity 
but serge klarsfeld a lawyer and prominent nazi hunter has 
said senior government officials including president francois 
mitterrand appear reluctant to pursue the case 
bousquet was condemned in 1949 for his wartime activities but 
the decision was reversed due to acts accomplished in favor of 
the resistance namely his decision to free some jailed 
resistance fighters at the time he was ousted from his post 
human rights leaders say none of the highranking french 
political figures with direct roles in deporting and arresting 
100000 jews during the war has been brought to justice 
yves jouffa president of the french league of human rights has 
said the recent trial of the gestapo chief of lyon klaus barbie 
was the trial of nazi germany not collaborationist france 
a federation of human rights groups has organized a commisison 
of inquiry to determine why action against bousquet and two other 
suspected war criminals paul touvier and maurice papon has taken 
so long 
touvier 75 is being prosecuted for his activities as a 
pronazi militia chief who worked with barbie in lyon he was 
captured last year after spending years in hiding under the shelter 
of rightwing roman catholic monks 
charges against papon a former budget minister have been 
pending for seven years he has been accused of responsibility for 
the arrests and deportations of 1700 jews while an administrator

the defense ministry today ordered an 
inquiry into a secret agreement between the military and the cia 
that set up a guerrilla network in case of a soviet invasion 
current and former government officials have said the agreement 
was made in 1955 
members of the greeces conservative government and of the 
former socialist administration have said the network essentially 
went out of business in 1974 and was dismantled by 1988 
reports from other countries indicate the secret network 
extended to most nato members during the cold war it has become 
known commonly as operation gladio the name of its italian 
version 
leftist parties in greece have denounced the secret agreement 
and they demand to know whether the network was ever used for 
clandestine activities in times of peace

in a rare show of unity rival 
guerrilla commanders launched an offensive against afghanistans 
sovietbacked government today in three provinces surrounding the 
capital rebel spokesmen said 
a barrage of rockets slammed into an ammunition dump several 
miles north of the afghan capital kabul just before dawn 
signaling the start of a blitz on dozens of government targets 
they said 
it was one of the governments largest ammunition dumps 
said minhaj a spokesman for a joint rebel news organization known 
as midia 
there were no immediate reports of casualties and no way to 
independently confirm the claims the rebel sources spoke from 
pakistan where the guerrilla groups have their headquarters 
one western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonoymity said 
in islamabad that something was happening but that he and 
others were scrambling for details 
farid a member of the hezbeislami the most radical and 
antiwest of the seven major guerrilla groups said the offensive 
on kabul logar and wardak provinces took several weeks to plan 
the main purpose of the operation is to eventually take 
kabul said farid who like most afghans uses only one name 
minhaj said sporadic and often confused reports from the 
battlefront indicated guerrilla fighters were launching rockets at 
dozens of government targets in an arc around kabul 
the guerrillas financed by the united states saudi arabia and 
other sympathetic arab states have been fighting for more than 12 
years to overthrow successive communiststyle governments in 
afghanistan 
most of the countryside is under the guerrillas control and 
troops loyal to president najibullah hold the major cities 
the guerrillas have failed to score a major military victory 
since february 1989 when the last of 115000 soviet soldiers ended 
nine years of direct intervention and withdrew from afghanistan 
instead the guerrilla leaders once touted as an alternative to 
najibullah have become bitterly divided najibullah has taken 
advanatge of their feuding to score some political and military 
victories in the past year 
guerrilla leader gulbuddin hekmatyar who has been criticized by 
other rebel leaders as brutal and ambitious claims to be leading 
the latest offensive 
all the groups have joined hands and all the field commanders 
are involved in this offensive said farid a spokesman for 
hekmatyar theyve all agreed that hekmatyar will lead 
however no other guerrilla group conceded hekmatyars 
leadership

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev today urged a 
new world order in which his country would abandon totalitarianism 
for democracy and discard separatist passions and nationalism 
in sketching his grand vision for europe and the world at the 
34nation paris summit the conference on security and cooperation 
in europe gorbachev made a rare reference to totalitarianism 
in the soviet union 
gorbachev deemed the 1975 helsinki final act on which the csce 
process was built a human rights document ahead of its time 
the csce he said enabled international relations to change in the 
last five years 
in the soviet union this meant a shift away from 
totalitarianism to a democratic system away from the command 
economy to a state underpinned by the rule of law away from 
unitarianism to a union of sovereign states he said 
our country has changed and will never be the same as it was 
before he added we have opened up to the world and the world 
has opened up in response 
alluding only briefly to his present difficulties at home 
gorbachev predicted with characteristic confidence that they would 
not affect his countrys role on the world stage 
no matter what difficulties the soviet union faces today it 
will remain a great european power in line with its enormous 
potential gorbachev said 
he proceeded to outline soviet visions for the future of europe 
saying that the crumbling warsaw pact alliance intends to take 
important decisions at a summit planned for december gorbachev 
reiterated the kremlins desire to see naval weapons and tactical 
nuclear arms reduced by future european negotiations 
diplomats who have toiled in vienna since march 1989 to seal the 
historic accord reducing conventional arms and other negotiators 
working on measures to reduce tension will return to the austrian 
capital on nov 26 for further talks 
gorbachev urged that the talks include all 34 nations in the 
csce process rather than just the 22 nato and warsaw pact 
countries who worked on the conventional arms accord 
although generally upbeat gorbachev did warn of international 
conflicts such as the gulf crisis and domestic tensions that 
could undo changes in europe particularly in the east 
rising ethnic tensions and even separatist demands to change 
europes post1945 borders could have a destructive snowball 
effect if any government gives way to them he noted 
warning against the balkanization of entire regions in europe 
gorbachev urged west and east to work together to create new 
structures for the continents environment economy and technology 
this constitutes the only truly democratic chance of asserting 
a positive influence on internal developments in a number of 
countries gorbachev noted 
most of eastern europes emerging democracies are rent by 
economic woes and ethnic passions nowhere is this more evident 
than in the soviet union where shops in large cities are barer 
than ever before and demands for the independence of the 15 
republics and other regions from moscow grow more strident each 
day

following is a transcript of an address delivered 
monday by president bush at the 34nation summit of the conference 
on cooperation and security in europe 
mr chairman this is a glorious day for europe this morning i 
signed for my country an arms control agreement which ends the 
military confrontation that has cursed this continent for decades 
this afternoon we welcome a summit document a charter of paris 
which expresses the common aspirations of our society it is right 
that we gather here in this magnificent city a city of 
civilization to declare our hopes for the future and to mark a 
grand turn in the course of history 
today we do justice to the original framers of the helsinki 
final act the goals they set have proven their worth thanks to 
the courage of so many who dared not merely to hope but to act we 
salute men of courage havel and mazowiecki and antall here with 
us today and all the other activists who took helsinkis goals as 
solemn commitments and who suffered so that these commitments 
would be honored 
and we salute all those individuals and private groups in the 
west who showed that the protection of human rights is not just the 
business of governments its everyones business 
nongovernmental organizations the press religious leaders and 
ordinary citizens their dreams are being realized before our eyes 
thenew democracies of central and eastern europe have ended 
decades of depression to rediscover their birthright of freedom in 
the soviet union the seeds of democracy and human rights have 
found new soil and at long last the cruel division of germany has 
come to an end 
a continent frozen in hostility for so long has become a 
continent of revolutionary change to assure that this change 
occurs in a secure framework we have completed a conventional arms 
control treaty that transforms the military map of this continent 
we are adopting confidence and securitybuilding measures that 
will contribute to lasting peace through openness 
this morning 22 of us signed a solemn undertaking on the 
nonuse of force but today as old political divisions disappear 
other sources of tension some ancient some new are emerging 
national disputes persist abuses of minority and human rights 
continue where millions had once been denied the freedom to move 
now millions feel compelled to move to escape economic or political 
hardship 
we are witnessing in several countries the ugly resurgence of 
antisemitism and other ethnic racial and religious intolerance 
bigotry and hatred have no place in civilized nations 
minorities enrich our societies protection of their rights is a 
prerequisite for stability 
europe is entering unknown waters the csce is ideally suited to 
help its member states navigate we have articulated fine standards 
for national behavior and now it is our task to bring csce down to 
earth making it part of everyday politics building and drawing on 
its strength to address the new challenges 
my government put forward some ideas for the future development 
of the csce earlier this year and i hope that they contributed to 
the initiatives that the members of the north atlantic alliance 
announced at our london summit in july and i am pleased to see 
that so many of the ideas discussed there have emerged in the 
summit declaration that we will sign this week 
let me highlight how we think some of these initiatives and 
others will help the csce put its principles into practice the 
declaration we will sign establishes an agenda to guide our work 
until we meet again in helsinki this is important work on issues 
vital to all of us the peaceful settlement of disputes the role 
of minorities in our societies the construction of democratic 
institutions and most fundamental of all the enhancement of human 
rights

the us military today canceled 
a second attempt at a mock invasion on a saudi beach because of 
poor weather and said it was scrapping the maneuver 
the marine assault in waterskimming hovercraft was expected to 
have been one of the dramatic highlights of the first joint 
ussaudi military exercise codenamed imminent thunder the 
sixday exercise ends wednesday 
the marines had tried to storm the beach on sunday and today 
but heavy seas and high winds prevented the mock invasion the us 
military said there would not be a third attempt 
maj gen harry w jenkins jr commander of the marine 
expeditionary brigade said he thought sundays amphibious landing 
would have gone ahead in a real war but there was no need to risk 
casualties for a drill 
some officers aboard the amphibious landing ship uss gunston 
hall however said similar conditions could thwart planned 
landings in actual combat 
winter seas in the gulf normally average 2 to 4 feet but the 
season is characterized by periodic north winds during which waves 
reach 8 to 15 feet according to navy officials 
the high seas usually occur about two times each winter between 
october and january 
on sunday helicopters from the uss guam deposited 400 troops in 
the mock invasion force on a saudi beach 80 miles south of the 
kuwaiti border us british and french warplanes roared overhead 
giving simulated air support among the troops were 36 saudi 
arabian marines 
jenkins called the exercise a success even without the marine 
landings because it showed the allied forces could work together 
i was pleased weve had as few glitches as weve had so far 
because its tough to bring everyone together he said 
iraqi president saddam hussein has denounced the exercises as 
provocative 
navy cmdr christopher j ellis of fairfax station va the 
us adviser to the saudi navy said he believes news leaks caused 
the military to move the exercise media reports last week said it 
would be 10 miles from the kuwaiti border 
yet it was too close to iraqi forces for some marines 
im not gonna lie im scared but if anything goes down im 
ready said pfc felipe williams 
jenkins insisted the exercise was not meant to threaten saddam 
but saudi marine capt muhammad alaseeri said he was pleased 
only a few dozen saudi marines were involved we dont want more 
troops because saddam hussein might take it too seriously he 
said 
marine maj john toolan of new york said he wanted to use the 
exercise to send a message to saddam were ready and capable to 
carry out our presidents orders 
defense analysts said imminent thunders main aim is to test the 
airstrike capability of the multinational force deployed in the 
gulf following iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the exercise is using 1100 warplanes double iraqs air power 
and represents the largest use of aircraft in an exercise during 
operation desert shield no ammunition is being fired 
the aviation part has gone very well jenkins said its 
evidence of the flexibility we have 
under us military rules the amphibious section of imminent 
thunder was covered by several media pools but there was no pool 
monitoring air operations 
the marines have practiced amphibious landings in bahrain and 
oman but this was the first on saudi soil 
the amphibious assault was supposed to commence 25 miles 
offshore in a technique called over the horizon because shore 
cant be seen when the amphibious craft are launched but winds of 
20 to 25 mph have stirred up choppy waves estimated at 4 feet to 10 
feet 
the marines hulking aircushioned amphibious landing craft are 
designed to skim over the waves and roar onto a beach carrying 
marines and tracked vehicles 
one was launched sunday from the gunston hall but it foundered 
in the choppy gulf its engines sputtering and groaning after a 
lengthy struggle it returned to the ship and the seaborne assault 
was scrapped

the person most likely to succeed william j 
bennett as director of the nations drug control strategy is 
florida gov bob martinez who recently lost his reelection bid a 
white house official says 
bennett meanwhile is in line to become chairman of the 
republican national committee in january republican sources said 
over the weekend he would take over for the ailing lee atwater 
39 who has been undergoing intensive treatment for a cancerous 
brain tumor 
rep charles b rangel chairman of the house select committee 
on narcotics said today president bush should not nominate 
martinez 
the president needs to take advantage of this opportunity and 
appoint to he position of national drug control policy director not 
someone who has lost an election but someone who is acceptable to 
republicans and democrats rangel said the nominee should be 
chosen not because of his political resume but for his continued 
dedication and ability to be successful as a commander in the war 
on drugs 
the 55yearold martinez is probably going to be the next drug 
czar said the white house official who spoke sunday on 
condition of anonymity nobody else is being actively 
considered 
officially the white house was mum as was martinezs 
spokesman 
i dont have any details on candidates im afraid said 
white house spokesman bill harlow contacted in paris where he was 
traveling with the president as far as i know no decision has 
been made on that position 
the governors spokesman jon peck said from tallahassee at 
this point everything is just speculation martinez would 
consider the position if asked by bush but thats not to say 
that its something he has been actively working to get 
martinez was trounced in his reelection effort by former sen 
lawton chiles losing by a 5743 percent margin he was only the 
second republican governor in florida since reconstruction his 
term ends jan 8 when chiles is to be inaugurated 
bush traveled to florida three times to campaign for martinez 
and first lady barbara bush made a campaign commercial on his 
behalf jeb bush one of the presidents sons was martinezs 
campaign chairman 
florida has had a lot of experience with drug problems most of 
the nations cocaine supply went through florida until the 
mid1980s when a crackdown there pushed traffickers west to mexico 
and the southwest us border states 
the national drug strategy compiled by bennetts office of 
national drug control policy last january designated the miami area 
as one of countrys five highintensity drug trafficking areas 
enabling it to receive additional federal antidrug assistance 
bennett 47 announced his resignation nov 8 after 20 months on 
the job he will remain in the post until nov 30 aides say 
an administration source confirmed sunday that bennett who was 
education secretary for president reagan but did not become a 
republican until 1986 had made up his mind to accept the gop job 
on saturday morning initially he had planned to become a fellow 
at a conservative think tank the american enterprise institute 
and write books on drugs and education 
bush brushed aside reporters questions sunday about bennett 
taking the rnc job 
were not discussing that he said with a smile a lot 
happens when i leave 
atwater who managed bushs 1988 presidential campaign will 
assume the title of general chairman of the party said a 
senior administration official in paris traveling with the 
president asked whether the idea was bushs or atwaters the 
official said it was both 
a gop source said a formal announcement of bennetts new job 
would not be made until bush returned at the end of the week from 
his eightday trip to europe and the persian gulf 
despite his job as bushs chief lieutenant in the war on drugs 
bennett has spoken out on such issues as education and abortion 
and he made numerous campaign trips around the country prior to the 
nov 6 election 
bennett called rangel a gasbag shortly after announcing his 
resignation from the drug post 
rangel long at odds with bennett over drug issues said i 
formally welcome mr bennett to the political fray 
i am happy to see the president believes bill bennett is more 
qualified in a partisan political post than as coordinator of 
national antidrug efforts rangel said 
bennett boasted nov 8 that the bush administrations drug 
strategy was working and that americans have turned against drugs 
reports from hospital emergency rooms show the number of 
cocainerelated visits have declined in the past few months 
surveys also have shown that casual use of all drugs is declining 
and cocaine supplies are drying up illustrated by higher prices 
and declining purity 
however violence in many large cities is increasing bennett 
has attributed the increased murder rate to drug traffickers vying 
for shares of the dwindling market

when chuck bergensky looks at the 
grimy sandstone walls of the west virginia penitentiary he sees 
thousands and thousands of happy shoppers 
i visualize a very successful outlet shopping mall i see 
things like a parking lot for 1000 cars in the prison yard and 35 
or 40 shops inside the walls the city manager said 
and not only that 
we would keep some of the cellblocks to attract people and 
maybe put the electric chair on display he said friday 
bergensky and a group of businessmen and others have proposed 
turning the civil warera prison into a mall after it closes in 
1992 under court order 
the city is spending about 13000 for architectural and 
feasibility studies if the city and a stateappointed economic 
development group decide to go ahead with the idea the prison will 
be sold or leased to developers for conversion 
the maximumsecurity penitentiary resembles a medieval fortress 
with parapets gun slots and arches its 24foot walls were 
quarried with convict labor now blackened by pollution the walls 
are 7 feet thick at the base and taper to 28 inches at the top 
stuart patz a vienna va consultant said preliminary figures 
indicate the mall could attract busloads of tourists and shoppers 
from pittsburgh about 85 miles to the northeast he declined to 
estimate what the project would cost 
all indications are that the project is feasible patz said 
he said he expects to complete an analysis of the project by early 
december 
the prison stands on a 10acre plot in a residential area in 
this ohio river town of 11000 it still houses the gallows where 
85 men were hanged from 1899 to 1949 nine men died in the prisons 
electric chair from 1951 to 1959 
in 1973 it was the site of a major riot in 1979 a police 
officer and an inmate were killed when 15 inmates escaped in 1986 
three inmates were killed and more than a dozen prison workers 
taken hostage in a new years day riot 
underfunding and overcrowding prompted a judge in 1983 to 
declare prison conditions unconstitutional in 1988 after millions 
were spent on improvements the state supreme court ordered the 
place closed saying conditions had become too appalling to 
correct 
the prison has about 550 inmates down from a peak of about 
1200 in the 1970s a new maximumsecurity prison is being built in 
fayette county 
moundsville officials dread the time when the prison and its 300 
jobs leave they say a mall could stem unemployment and provide the 
impetus to reopen a factory and other businesses 
i think it would be a great thing for the city of moundsville 
to carry on with the prison and make it a place that people want to 
come to said mayor dorothy durig we could even stage 
breakouts twice a day 
nanette collins 45 lives a block from the prison and doesnt 
want to see it torn down 
its a landmark she said i dont think that anyone would 
be bothered by the fact that it was a prison people are curious 
and theyd get a chance to see what a prison really looks like 
not everyone likes the idea 
i think they could find a better place to build a shopping 
mall said robert leach 33 an inmate serving two life sentences 
without parole for two murders considering its history i dont 
know why the public would want anything to do with it

kohl whose meal ended prematurely 
as photographers rushed to take pictures of mrs bush one of 
them accidentally bumped into the wife of german chancellor helmut 
kohl the french photographers camera and heavy lens grazed her 
neck as they slipped off his shoulder 
mrs kohl winced and began rubbing the wound while mrs bush 
expressed her concern mrs kohl excused herself from the table 
after being hurt the photographer said he was unaware of the 
incident when it happened and he later apologized to the german 
leaders wife 
raisa gorbachev soberly dressed in a navy blue and white 
pinstriped suit highnecked white blouse and spiked heels was 
the last to arrive skipping the guided tour of the grand trianon 
built in pink marble in 1687 by louis xiv to accommodate his 
volatile private life 
she exchanged warm greetings with mrs bush who wore a black 
and white houndstooth suit a paisley blouse and her trademark 
doublestrand choker pearls

thick walls unearthed during recent excavations 
she appeared fascinated with a solid gold helmet dug from a 
latrine dating to the 18th century when city life centered around 
the louvre

sen dennis deconcini today strongly defended 
himself against wrongdoing in his dealings with savings and loan 
owner charles keating jr and accused the senate ethics committees 
special counsel of relying on lies and hearsay 
i submit this is disgraceful i submit there is a bias and i 
think it is unconscionable deconcini said of allegations by the 
senate committees lawyer robert s bennett who is presenting the 
case against the socalled keating five 
deconcini an arizona democrat was the last of the five 
senators to offer an opening statement defending himself to the 
ethics committee he said bennetts evidence contains hearsay 
contains rumors unfounded allegations about all of the senators 
the other accused senators republican john mccain of arizona 
and democrats alan cranston of california john glenn of ohio and 
donald riegle of michigan offered emotional personal statements on 
friday against allegations they improperly intervened with federal 
regulators on behalf of keating a financial contributor to their 
campaigns and causes 
deconcini read from a prepared statement and stopped often to 
read from letters memos and other evidence he said bennett had 
left out or used selectively in his presentation he denounced 
derogatory information lies and allegations and hearsay that mr 
bennett goes out and gets people to give 
deconcini concluded his statement on an emotional note calling 
for reform in the campaign financing laws but insisting he had 
nothing to apologize for 
to do other than dismiss the charges against me is unjust 
deconcini said i broke no law i broke no rule i broke no 
standard i committed no improper conduct theres been no 
unethical conduct by this senator 
deconcini also complained that he had been treated more harshly 
by bennett than mccain his arizona colleague and said the 
relationship between bennett and mccain was kind of cozy 
he said bennett had failed to ask mccain about his wifes 
investments with keating and without pressing him on family 
vacations the mccains took at keatings vacation spot bennett 
mentioned both last week but dismissed them as without serious 
consequence 
special prosecutor 
deconcini said it was ridiculous for bennett to suggest that 
campaign contributions from keating or any other constituent were 
tied to his efforts to help those with a legitimate beef with 
the federal government 
they have a right to ask for your intervention deconcini 
said 
he said federal regulators and bureaucrats often are wrong 
in dealing with constituents and somebody ought to stand up 
for them 
at the time keating was an arizona businessman and owner of the 
irvine califbased lincoln savings and loan whose 1989 collapse 
and federal seizure is expected to cost taxpayers 2 billion 
deconcini said he did no more for keating than he would for 
other constituents without regard to campaign contributions 
im accessible i talk to constituents i call them back on 
the phone myself if i can he said 
in defending his involvement with keating deconcini said 
keating is a different person than he is perceived today he 
said keating had contributed substantially to mother teresa who 
was awarded the nobel peace prize for her work with the poor 
deconcini also attacked the motives of common cause the 
lobbying and public interest group whose original complaint sparked 
the ethics panels probe into the five senators 
i can tell you what theyre trying to achieve theyre trying 
to raise money theyre trying to damage the reputation of a number 
of senators i think its a travesty deconcini said 
after deconcinis opening statement bennett was to begin 
presenting evidence and calling witnesses 
bennetts case centers on meetings between the five senators and 
federal banking regulators as the regulators were preparing to 
recommend criminal investigation of lincoln by the justice 
department 
keating who faces criminal fraud charges in california and is 
the object of civil fraud suits said through his attorney he wants 
to testify before the committee but only if he receives immunity 
the keating case presents the ethics committee with the 
difficult question of what actions by senators on behalf of 
political contributors are improper 
among the five bennett has suggested that deconcini and 
cranston were most deeply involved with keating 
evidence shows deconcini was asked repeatedly to perform 
services for charles keating and that senator deconcini almost 
always honored mr keatings request bennett said 
bennett said an april 1987 meeting that four of the senators 
held with edwin gray then top bank regulator was organized by 
deconcini with the intent to place tremendous political pressure 
on chairman gray to achieve a specific outcome desired by charles 
keating 
in that meeting bennett said deconcini proposed a deal to drop 
a proposed banking rule that keating opposed while in exchange 
lincoln would make more home loans 
he also said keating enlisted senator deconcini in his effort 
to drive chairman gray from office 
bennett said deconcini continued trying to assist keating even 
after the senators were told on april 9 1987 that bank regulators 
planned criminal referrals involving lincoln deconcinis efforts 
the counsel said included calls in april 1989 in an effort to 
persuade bank regulators to allow the sale of lincoln after 
lincoln had learned that results of a new bank examination were 
going to be disastrously negative 
deconcini received 48100 in contributions from keating and 
associates for his 1988 reelection campaign which he later 
returned and 33000 for his 1982 campaign

a deputy interior minister revealed monday that 
more than 15 million soviets use illegal drugs a figure nearly 
five times higher than previous official statistics on drug abuse 
the sale of illegal drugs mostly marijuana and hashish also 
contributes 18 billion a year to the soviet unions flourishing 
underground economy sergeyev troshin said on the first day of a 
conference of heads of european antidrug agencies 
he said the problem will worsen as the soviet union loosens 
border restrictions and increases contacts with the west 
troshin did not give figures on illegal drug use from previous 
years and it could not immediately be determined which forms of 
drug use had increased in the country of 285 million people 
interior minister vadim bakatin last summer had said there were 
220000 drug abusers and 40000 addicts in the country 
soviet authorities once maintained that social problems such as 
drug abuse and alcoholism were mainly products of capitalist 
systems and they did not release such statistics for the soviet 
population 
troshin was elected chairman of the fiveday conference the 
first time drug agencies from eastern and western europe have come 
together to combat drug trafficking across the continent 
representatives from 28 european countries the united states 
canada and the united nations were attending the gathering 
if we take into account the expanding contacts with the west 
and the forthcoming emigration bill which will bring about 
increased contacts we must presuppose that the trend will get 
worse troshin said at news conference 
the soviet legislature has been debating a bill to allow soviet 
citizens free entry to and exit from the country but has not set a 
date for a vote 
the development of events in our country and in europe in 
general has shown to everybody that it is necessary to join efforts 
in the fight with the plague of the 20th century which is the 
illegal trafficking in drugs troshin said 
un undersecretarygeneral margaret anstee who coordinates the 
organizations drugabuse programs said the drug problem was 
worsening in western europe 
but as the government of the ussr has recognized the 
tentacles of this problem are also stretching eastward and its 
becoming an increasing concern to the authorities here she said 
troshin said 80 percent to 90 percent of illegal drug use in the 
soviet union involves products of the cannabis plant opium is the 
second most popular illegal substance followed by narcotic 
medicines he said 
also alcohol is abused by 20 million to 25 million soviet 
citizens he said 
we have to join our efforts because of relationship with 
europe is on the increase and the flow of immigration is increasing 
and we already know of cases of smuggling of drugs troshin said 
mrs anstee said she hoped the meeting would come up with 
concrete proposals as to how cooperation can be strengthened in 
the fight against illicit drug abuse illicit drug trafficking all 
over europe

police perched on rooftops posed as streetsweepers 
and escorted motorcades atop glossy white motorcycles minding both 
men and manners monday at the landmark european summit 
up to 10000 police fanned out over paris as 34 heads of state 
and government 1000 delegates and some 5000 journalists gathered 
for the threeday meeting of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
authorities sealed off an entire neighborhood near the arc de 
triomphe where the meeting was held banning traffic closing a 
metro station and diverting 15 bus lines 
they had spent a month combing the streets of the posh quarter 
interrogating residents and shopkeepers and even installing barbed 
wire in strategic parts of the citys vast sewer system a 
historic haunt for neerdowells 
on monday the eyes of the law were everywhere sharpshooters 
perched on rooftops legions of riot police surveyed the streets 
around the champselysees while collegues scanned the city from 
armchairs in a newly modernized surveillance command post at police 
headquarters 
police spokesman marcel vinzerich confirmed a report that some 
undercover police took up the green brooms of the citys sanitation 
department or posed as merchants in the strategic triangle sealed 
off around the kleber international conference center 
lots of preventative measures have been taken said 
vinzerich in a telephone interview 
he noted however that the 10000strong force is only half the 
size of that deployed in 1989 when france hosted a summit of the 
worlds seven richest nations amid gala celebrations for the 
bicentennial of the french revolution 
this is a big job but this time we dont have the crowds to

berliners who fearfully stockpiled tons of meat 
milk and grain to guard against a fourdecade soviet threat now 
want to ship the stored food to people who really need it the 
soviets themselves 
former west berlin once pushed to the brink of starvation by a 
soviet blockade has asked the german government to use the old 
emergency provisions to help ease dire shortages in the soviet 
union 
the federal government is expected to make a decision this week 
the material is not necessary any more the situation has 
changed juergen varnhorn a berlin government spokesman said 
monday so why not help the soviet union 
berlins plan to ship supplies to the very nation that made such 
emergency stockpiles necessary is yet another of the ironies that 
have followed german unification and soviet disintegration 
germany now is paying soviet troops based in eastern germany and 
will finance their withdrawal over the next four years 
one of those soldiers ran amok early monday with an armored 
vehicle roaring down the kurfuerstendamm the main shopping street 
in former west berlin it would have been an international incident 
during the cold war but now is a local police matter 
the scores of fortified storehouses stuffed with canned 
vegetables and fruit powdered milk and coffee are true relics of 
the cold war and a direct result of the soviet blockade of west 
berlin three years after germany lost world war ii 
the soviets who had control of the east side of the city and 
the surrounding territory that was to become east germany closed 
roads waterways and railroads leading to west berlin in 1948 in an 
effort to drive out the western allies 
west berliners were confined to the city for 36 days without 
food and coal the allies then launched the famous berlin airlift 
flying 18 million tons of goods into the city and breaking the 
blockade 
the soviets lifted the blockade on may 12 1949 but tensions 
worsened and culminated with the construction of the berlin wall in 
1961 
west berlin meanwhile stockpiled enormous quanities of food 
clothing and medicine as a hedge against the chance that the 
soviets would launch another blockade 
that threat evaporated with the opening of the berlin wall last 
year and german unification on oct 3 sweeping changes wrought by 
the reform policies of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the berlin senate in a gesture of goodwill voted to ask bonn 
for permission to send the food to the soviets one week before 
gorbachevs nov 9 visit to germany the first anniversary of the 
opening of the berlin wall 
finance minister theo waigel in a interview monday with the 
german newspaper die welt said the government was considering the 
proposal as one of the ways germany could provide relief to the 
soviets during what is expected to be a dangerous winter of severe 
shortages 
the supplies include hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar 
milk toothpaste grain coal heating oil and other provisions 
worth up to 16 billion 
varnhorn said only the food supplies would be sent to the 
soviets no decision has been made on what to do with the medicine 
clothing and cleaning materials still in storage 
food already is being rationed in several soviet cities and 
rationing is to begin next month in leningrad the nations 
secondlargest city 
president bush said he would be willing to provide emergency 
food supplies and humanitarian aid to the soviets and other 
western nations have said they also may provide aid to get the 
politically torn and economically reeling nation through the 
winter

many people cook an elaborate feast just once a 
year on thanksgiving 
anthony dias blue and his wife kathryn k blue think about 
that dinner all year long and they have written a book 
thanksgiving dinner harpercollins about it 
this is 20 years of finetuning our techniques and dealing 
with what our children will eat blue a widely syndicated wine 
columnist said in a recent interview 
thanksgiving is not a potluck dinner it is a complex feast 
that requires organization and considerable precision the blues 
write and they plan ahead a menu by nov 1 all staples bought 
two weeks ahead and kept in separate boxes fresh turkey ordered 
ahead 
on thursday an estimated 45 million turkeys will be cooked and 
family after family will confront the ageold conundrum of whether 
to stuff or not 
rick rodgers author of the turkey cookbook recommends 
roasting a turkey with onions celery and carrots in its cavities 
and cooking the stuffing or dressing on the side 
although an unstuffed turkey cooks faster and more evenly and 
the blues have been on both sides of the big stuffing question 
over the years blue said he finds the synergism between the 
turkey and stuffing to be more important 
the blues will roast two turkeys both stuffed for the 22 
people who will be at their dinner thursday in their home in san 
francisco one turkey will hold a sausagecrouton stuffing the 
other an oystercornbread stuffing 
their table also will hold a root vegetable puree and other 
vegetables cranberry relish prune chutney steamed persimmon 
pudding pumpkin flan and gingerbread bread pudding 
there are certain things in every family that have to be 
made blue said adding that for his family its schatzes corn 
pudding which his mother made for decades 
it has things i dont approve of canned corn evaporated 
milk blue said but when made with fresh ingredients it wasnt 
as good he said 
my kids absolutely adore it said blue who usually passes 
it by 
but one of the advantages of thanksgiving dinner is that there 
are choices the cook need not double or triple recipes instead 
make more dishes and let people pick and choose blue advises 
said 
thats what this is all about the feast of the harvest i 
would never have a strawberry dessert because the fruit is out 
of season he said 
and he frowns on chocolate for thanksgiving although there are 
three desserts that call for it in his book the carrot torte 
chocolate pecan pie and chocolatechestnut mousse 
on his radio program blue said he once tore apart a caller 
who suggested asparagus fresh in springtime for thanksgiving 
our delivery system has gotten too good it takes a little bit of 
the joy out of the seasonal changes of eating 
the blues include 150 recipes from appetizers to leftovers in 
thanksgiving dinner 
they include many from friends in california but evidence that 
thanksgiving is a family holiday include recipes named for their 
children amandas chocolate carrot torte caitlins potatoes 
jessicas caramelized apple tart and tobys instant replay 
sandwich 
thanksgiving certainly is tradition but not one that officially 
dates to 1621 and the pilgrims the blues write the pilgrims and 
others who followed had meals of thanksgiving from time to time 
but a regular national thanksgiving holiday began in 1863 when 
president lincoln was persuaded by sarah josepha hale author of 
mary had a little lamb to declare it so 
under it all whats so great about thanksgiving 
you get to eat a lot and you dont have to give presents

the troop buildup was announced by the iraqi news agency 11 days 
after bush said 200000 more us soldiers would be shipped to the 
region to bring the american force to 430000 previously iraq was 
believed to have about 170000 troops in kuwait and about 250000 
men in southern iraq 
president saddam hussein and his military commanders met and 
decided to send seven extra divisions of the regular army and 
another 150000 reserves and draftees the news agency said 
this means the united states will need to mobilize a 
3millionstrong force with similar equipment and armament to our 
forces if it is to attack the news agency said 
in washington pentagon spokesman lt col rick oborn said the 
department would have no comment on the iraqi report 
on sunday iraq said it would free the estimated 2000 remaining 
westerners stranded in iraq and occupied kuwait between christmas 
and march 25 unless something would take place that mars the 
atmosphere of peace 
saddam has been releasing westerners a few at a time and scores 
of freed americans flew home from london today 
bush called the iraqi announcement a bid to buy time 
this cynicism of starting to release them on christmas day 
will be seen by the world as a total ploy he said in paris 
where nato and warsaw pact leaders signed an arms reduction treaty 
bush used the gathering of 34 leaders to try to win more support 
for a un resolution authorizing an attack to drive iraqi forces 
from kuwait 
some us allies in the persian gulf crisis including the 
soviet union and germany expressed concern that bush was rushing 
toward war 
but prime minister margaret thatcher of britain reiterated her 
support for bushs position saying that saddam can avoid war only 
by withdrawing quickly from kuwait 
most people understand evil has to be stopped either he 
withdraws or the military option has to be used she said after 
seeing bush in paris where nato and warsaw pact leaders signed an 
arms reduction treaty 
however soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said he was sure 
a way could be found to avoid war and that he would offer new 
ideas in a meeting with bush today chancellor helmut kohl of 
germany told bush on sunday that all options short of war must 
first be exhausted 
analysts have said a military strike against iraqi forces is 
most likely in winter because of lower temperatures and generally 
calm weather sandstorms usually occur in april 
secretary of state james a baker iii has met in the past week 
with foreign ministers from many of the 15 members of the un 
security council seeking support for the resolution endorsing a 
military assault if the unordered embargo on trade with iraq 
fails 
some diplomats say the proposal could be made before the end of 
the month 
in other developments today high winds and rough seas forced 
us marines to cancel a second attempt to storm a saudi beach in 
an amphibious landing exercise similar conditions forced the 
exercise to be scrubbed on sunday and officials said no further 
attempts will be made 
scores of americans stranded in iraq and kuwait left london for 
washington today seventyfive americans were among the 136 former 
hostages freed sunday by iraq and flown to london on a 
uschartered flight from from baghdad most of the passengers 
were wives and children of kuwaitis 
for four months we have been in hiding said an american 
woman who would not give her name people are starving and they 
need food but people who have food are frightened of giving it to 
them because they would be accused as collaborators 
we prayed every night that we would wake up in the morning 
she said 
douglas moore a british soccer coach who worked in kuwait for 
four years said many of those in hiding hope for an invasion 
the feeling of those in hiding is that the military should 
come and do something for gods sake they cannot hang on he 
said 
the saudi government announced that more than 300 iraqi officers 
and soldiers have defected to saudi arabia since the invasion of 
kuwait it was the first time that saudi arabia had officially 
confirmed defections some defectors have been reported to include 
iraqi soldiers with their tanks

even heads of state suffer through lifes little 
aggravations 
the limousine carrying hungarian prime minister jozsef antall to 
the 34nation summit cruised grandly down the street with its 
national flag upside down 
president bush had a little limo problem too the door handles 
on the armored car flown in from washington were torn off when 
the driver turned a corner a little too tight at the us 
ambassadors residence sunday night 
new handles were rushed by plane overnight from the united 
states 
when bush arrived at the elysee palace for lunch it required 
considerable jiggling to get the door open bush waited inside the 
car as two security agents struggled to open the door 
equals 
when presidents prime ministers and premiers gather for a 
summit its a sure bet theyll pose for an official portrait its 
called the class photo 
together the 34 leaders here may rule much of the world but 
its a real question of whos really the boss maybe its the 
photographers 
the leaders snap to attention at a mere shout from the 
cameramen at one point during the shooting of mondays class 
photo the leaders started leaving their assigned positions 
apparently having had enough 
but the photographers in unison shouted no hurriedly the 
leaders returned to their assigned positions bush and german 
chancellor helmut kohl finally decided it was time to leave and 
walked away so french president francois mitterrand the host 
ended the photo session 
equals 
marvelous president bush said monday the czech guys 
estimated 750000 
it was just an offhand comment to dutch prime minister ruud 
lubbers but it gave voice to a heated debate among white house 
officials 
white house imagemakers are furious about press estimates of the 
crowd that jammed pragues historic wenceslas square to hear the 
president on saturday afternoon 
by every account it was a huge audience most press reports put 
the number at more than 100000 but white house officials perhaps 
sensitive about bushs sagging popularity at home were insistent 
that the audience was much larger 
white house press aides said the secret service estimated the 
crowd at more than 1 million but these same officials said they 
really didnt believe the secret service number more like 750000 
they suggested 
yet that estimate was laughed at by veteran crowd counters in 
prague who have watched the square through a year of revolution 
demonstrations and celebrations as democracy triumphed 
even when political passions were at their height the estimate 
never ran above 300000 people and that was when the crowd stood 
shoulder to shoulder in the long rectangular boulevard 
when bush spoke the back of the boulevard was empty and there 
was plenty of space along the sides shortly before bush spoke 
czechoslovak state television estimated the crowd at 100000 later 
it said 15000 more people had arrived 
disbelieving white house officials however have been singling 
out reporters to complain that they shortchanged the president 
an insult to the people of czechoslovakia one official fumed 
bushs comment to lubbers apparently puts the argument to rest 
at least in the white house

a 13yearold leukemia victim whose 
father waged an unsuccessful legal battle for a potentially 
lifesaving bone marrow transplant died today a spokesman said 
jeanpierre bosze of suburban hoffman estates died this morning 
said edward jordan the bosze family attorney 
the childs father tamas bosze sought a landmark court ruling 
to force nancy curran his former girlfriend and the mother of 
jeanpierres 3yearold half siblings to have the twins tested 
as possible bone marrow donors 
curran opposed testing the twins saying the transplant 
procedure would be too painful in september the state supreme 
court affirmed a lower courts ruling in favor of curran 
bosze insisted the 3yearolds would want to help their brother 
if they were old enough to decide bosze never divorced 
jeanpierres mother and had twins with curran while the married 
couple was separated 
jeanpierres doctors meanwhile had warned that his condition 
was worsening bosze initially petitioned the courts in june 
in the initial lower court ruling cook county circuit judge 
monica reynolds held sept 6 that forcing the twins to take a blood 
test to determine whether they could be marrow donors for 
jeanpierre would violate their constitutional right to privacy 
bone marrow donations can save the lives of victims of leukemia 
and other diseases if a donor with closely matching tissue types 
usually a relative can be found bosze approached curran after 
tests showed that he jeanpierres mother jeanpierres brother 
and another half sister were all incompatible 
the marrow is extracted from the donor by inserting a long 
needle into the hipbone or breast bone 
a motion for the illinois supreme court to reconsider its 
decision was pending

the exiled emir of kuwait sent a 
message to the summit of 34 world leaders in paris on monday 
saying time was of paramount importance in removing iraqi troops 
from his country 
the continuing occupation of kuwait will eventually jeopardize 
world peace and security sheik jaber alahmed alsabah said in the 
message reported by the kuwait news agency 
at a time when the world is laying the foundations of a new 
international order based on justice peace and detente iraq has 
dealt a deadly blow to these principles by its occupation of an 
independent state said the emir 
the 34 members of the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe are meeting to discuss the shape of the world now that cold 
war divisions have ended 
but the summit at which the western and eastern military pacts 
also signed a treaty relegating thousands of their weapons to the 
scrap heap has been overshadowed by the persian gulf crisis 
presidents bush and mikhail gorbachev along with the other 
leaders are discussing how best to get iraq out of kuwait 
iraqs aggression has been directed at citizens of the nations 
represented at the paris gathering said the emir using them as 
instruments in a humiliating exploitation of human dignity and 
rights president saddam hussein is holding hundreds of 
westerners hostage 
it has thus become clear that the effects of the iraqi 
aggression have not stopped at kuwait but have exceeded it to hit 
at the world peace and security he said 
but the emir said he was satisfied with the courageous 
immediate and decisive stand taken by the international community 
against saddam 
the kuwaiti government has been residing in the saudi arabian 
mountain resort of taif since its members fled the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 the official news agency also is operating in 
exile

antiques in 1968 and was held for another 18 months in 1979 on

license and credit card in gerickes possession the officer said

less than two weeks before national elections 
chancellor helmut kohl is being toasted as a statesman in paris 
but reviled by some at home over possible tax increases 
opposition leaders claim germans soon will be paying more to the 
state to finance the costly merger of the two germanys despite the 
chancellors pledge to the contrary 
the dispute has added some drama to an election campaign that 
many had figured was decided even before it started polls indicate 
kohl will win a landslide victory on dec 2 in the first allgerman 
elections since 1933 
a new poll by the zdf television network indicated that kohl and 
his conservative party allies would win 455 percent of the vote 
nationwide more than enough for his christian democrats to form 
another strong coalition with the centrist free democrats 
zdf said the pollsters questioned 1000 people in former east 
germany and 1000 in former west germany at the beginning of this 
month 
kohls prestige has been bolstered by a continuing round of 
international attention 
he is representing the united germany at the 34nation summit in 
paris soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush 
have each come calling at his home in the village of oggersheim in 
recent days 
and its been less than seven weeks since kohl led the solemn 
unification ceremonies at the stately reichstag as the german flag 
was hoisted in the light of hundreds of glittering fireworks 
but uncertainty over the merger costs has many germans worried 
the west german national debt stood at 647 billion in june even 
before the east german debt was added to it 
the euphoria over the fall of the berlin wall a little more than 
a year ago has given way to the harsh reality of what it will cost 
to overhaul the former east germany some estimates have put the 
private and public costs in the hundreds of billions of dollars 
and in a country where ordinary workers pay more than 40 percent 
of their wages in taxes and other governmentmandated social 
benefit programs the talk of higher taxes has many up in arms 
even kohl has been talking about the possibility he told the 
stadtsanzeiger newspaper of cologne that germans soon will have to 
pay more in one area or another in the form of taxes or 
fees collected by the government 
kohl said he had never said there wouldnt be tax increases 
just that there wouldnt be any increases specifically to finance 
german unification 
his finance minister theo waigel in an interview with der 
spiegel magazine mentioned fees in the environmental area 
such fees as yet not precisely spelled out would be aimed at 
cutting down on motor vehicle pollution and raising revenues for 
ecological cleanup projects among other things 
oskar lafontaine of the opposition social democrats the 
challenger for the chancellors job seized on the remarks saying 
kohl was trying to hide the costs of unification 
now the cat is out of the bag he told reporters monday 
no one in germany believed any more that the exploding national 
debt could be tamed without taxes and fees being raised 
lafontaine said he would seek a parliamentary debate on the tax 
issue on thursday

the supreme courts handling of the 
cnnnoriega freepress dispute creates a loophole for shortlived 
gag orders against the news media 
although the court 14 years ago told judges they almost never 
may bar the reporting of information already in news media hands 
sundays 72 vote left intact such a restraint against cable news 
network 
the high courts action however was not unprecedented and may 
not have set any lasting rule of law 
cnn had asked the justices to lift an order by us district 
judge william hoeveler in miami forbidding the broadcast of 
conversations between manuel noriega the imprisoned former 
dictator of panama and his lawyers 
federal prison authorities monitor and tape record all inmates 
telephone conversations except when told that inmates are talking 
to their lawyers but cnn reportedly has seven tapes containing 
some conversations between noriega and his defense team 
when noriegas lawyers rushed into court to prevent the tapes 
from being broadcast the judge ordered cnn to let him hear the 
tapes so he could determine whether fairtrial rights would be 
jeopardized and the judge ruled that cnn could not broadcast the 
tapes until his determination was made 
the cable network citing a series of supreme court decisions 
carried its fight to washington rather than surrender the tapes 
now cnn will submit the tapes to hoeveler and await his decision 
on whether they may be broadcast 
the ordered delay is itself a prior restraint on reporting 
something the supreme court in 1976 called the most serious and 
least tolerable infringement of freepress rights 
in a key 1976 ruling the court unanimously struck down a gag 
order barring the news media from publishing a nebraska murder 
defendants confession after it was revealed in a public court 
hearing 
two of the seven justices who voted against cnn sunday said in 
1976 they seriously doubted whether such prior restraints ever 
could be valid 
writing for himself in the nebraska case justice byron r white 
said there is grave doubt in my mind whether orders with respect 
to the press such as were entered in this case would ever be 
justified 
in the same case justice john paul stevens wrote he might rule 
the press never can be barred from reporting information it has 
no matter how shabby or illegal the means by which the 
information is obtained how serious an intrusion on privacy might 
be involved how demonstrably false the information might be how 
prejudicial it might be and how perverse the motivation for 
publishing it 
those views could indicate sundays vote centered on some issue 
narrower than the constitutionality of hoevelers gag order 
if the judge after listening to the tapes decides to continue 
his ban cnn could return to the high court the justices would not 
be precluded from ruling at that time that cnns freepress rights 
were violated 
to some such a scenario might seem contradictory but similar 
action was taken before the 1976 ruling justice harry a blackmun 
rejected an emergency request to lift the nebraska judges 
restraining order pending the full courts decision 
in 1971 the court ruled the government could not bar the new 
york times and the washington post from publishing stories based on 
the socalled pentagon papers detailing us involvement in 
vietnam but for five days the newspapers were barred by a high 
court order from publishing such stories pending its decision 
and in 1979 the justices rejected an emergency request by the 
progressive magazine which was then under an order blocking 
publication of an article the government said would help other 
nations develop a hydrogen bomb 
the high court refused to order a federal appeals court to speed 
up its review of a restraining order issued by a trial judge the 
ban on publishing was in effect for more than seven months 
floyd abrams a first amendment expert representing cnn said 
sundays action left an opening through which defense lawyers and 
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles 
but if such tactics are allowed by lower courts abrams said 
the supreme court might intervene 
if cnn is not allowed to broadcast its tapes such supreme court 
intervention may not be far off 
 
editors note richard carelli has covered the supreme court for 
the associated press since 1976

a 3yearold multipletransplant patient 
suffered a setback and was undergoing tests monday to determine if 
she is rejecting the liver and small intestines 
tracey kay gonzales of corpus christi texas was admitted 
sunday night to childrens hospital of pittsburgh because she had 
diarrhea said hospital spokeswoman sue cardillo 
she was listed in fair condition 
doctors ordered a biopsy of the organs tracey received on july 
24 
the tests will take up to two days ms cardillo said 
doctors dont know exactly what the underlying problem is 
ms cardillo said is it a virus is it rejection or is it 
another problem it could be something as simple as a cold 
despite the diarrhea tracey was up and around and being her 
spunky little self ms cardillo said 
transplants of small intestines have a poor success rate since 
1983 one adult and three children have died within a year of their 
operations at pittsburgh hospitals one adult patient is still 
alive 
tracey has been doing well and living in pittsburgh with her 
mother pam since her operation still doctors are reluctant to 
predict what the future may hold for her 
it sounds cliche to say we are in uncharted territory but 
its a fact ms cardillo said you cant make longterm 
predictions 
tracey is taking the experimental drug fk506 which doctors say 
is safer and more potent than the common antirejection drug 
cyclosporin 
she needed the transplant operation because she suffered from 
short gut syndrome which left her small intestine unable to absorb 
nutrition her liver was damaged by a highprotein diet fed 
intravenously

gov mario cuomo eschewing his 
taxandspend reputation has proposed sharp spending cuts to 
eliminate a 1 billion state budget deficit even he thinks could 
affect his political future 
all around us there are signs of fiscal collapse cuomo said 
monday of the money problems facing new york many other states and 
the nation 
cuomos plan for plugging the hole in new yorks 30 billion 
state budget calls for firing at least 2000 state workers before 
the end of the fiscal year on march 31 and eliminating 4000 other 
jobs through attrition and early retirement 
every other state worker there are almost 250000 would have 
to take five days off without pay by the end of the fiscal year 
cuomo also called for reduced spending on schools and on poor 
people seeking health care 
this is the states third straight year of budget deficits in 
the past two years cuomo and the legislature have raised taxes by 
almost 3 billion including a record 18 billion hike earlier 
this year 
no more cuomo said new taxes would damage our competitive 
position in a weakening economy he explained 
it is obvious that the problem is national and will need 
national remedies cuomo also said but we cannot wait for 
washington 
cuomo considered a potential 1992 democratic presidential 
contender unveiled his budget plan saturday less than two weeks 
after voters rejected his proposed 2 billion environmental bond 
issue and gave him a smaller than expected reelection margin to a 
third term 
he got 53 percent of the vote compared with a record 65 percent 
in 1986 when he won a second term 
they said no taxes cuomo said of the voters 
cuomo who according to recent polls is the favorite among 
democrats for the partys presidential nomination has said that 
unless he puts the states fiscal house in order theres no point 
in even discussing a run for the white house 
while cuomo said there would be screams of protest because of 
his proposed cuts business interests praised the action 
politicians often say that government must do more with less 
governor cuomos plan gives substance to that statement said 
daniel walsh president of the business council of new york state 
cuomo who in past years often has said government must learn 
to do more with less has been frequently criticized by the 
council for allowing state spending to grow at more than twice the 
rate of inflation 
its a major departure from the last couple of years 
raymond horton president of the new york citybased citizens 
budget commission a businessfinanced budget watchdog group said 
of cuomos proposals 
lee miringoff head of the marist college institute for public 
opinion that regularly tracks new yorkers sentiments about cuomo 
said monday that the governor may have had an eye on the national 
scene when he prepared his budget plan 
to some degree this could represent a political inoculation 
for him miringoff said of cuomos call for spending cuts instead 
of higher taxes 
nonetheless miringoff said cuomo has to worry about alienating 
his own core constituency liberals labor and minorities as he 
moves to a more fiscally conservative position 
miringoff noted that when cuomo became governor in 1983 he told 
new yorkers we should have only the government we need but we 
must insist on all the government we need 
hes gone with only the government we need miringoff said 
of the latest budget plan

waves washed away the us 
militarys marine amphibious assault on a beachhead monday which 
had been intended to show iraq a possible opening scene in a war to 
free kuwait 
it was a glaring example of how the best laid plans can go awry 
in combat 
in this dress rehearsal cameras were ready to roll but the 
weather which has been a key but fickle factor in wars through the 
ages decided not to cooperate for the second day in a row 
the marines would have gone ahead with a landing sunday in a 
real war but it wasnt worth the risk to life and equipment in 
peacetime said maj gen harry w jenkins jr commander of the 
marine expeditionary brigade 
footage of us marines storming a saudi beach was supposed to 
be the visual centerpiece of the first joint ussaudi military 
exercise named imminent thunder 
in the broader combat exercise that ends wednesday the washout 
was relatively insignificant but in the highstakes game of 
psychological warfare it was something of a dud 
before sundays attempted assault marine maj john toolan said 
he spoke to his troops about the fourth dimension of warfare 
how the media helps spread the message about the power of the us 
armed forces 
when saddam hussein sees the marines and navy working so well 
together well make more money without ever firing a shot he 
said 
craft skim over the water at 50 mph because 14foot waves and high 
wind made them difficult to launch 
the american public and undoubtedly some iraqis did get to see 
helicopterborne saudi and us troops land on the beach sunday and 
join saudi and us ground forces 
a rendezvous sunday between saudi marines and a company of the 
marines 3rd light armored infantry marked the first time a regular 
us marine unit was allowed close to the kuwaiti border 
this is the first time that any of us have been this far 
north said another marine officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity our objective is to locate the enemy find gaps in his 
defenses and report back said the battalion executive officer 
maj jeff powers 35 of ridgefield nj 
on monday the marines participated in a simulated armored 
attack for the most part marine officers said they were satisfied 
the invading iraqi tanks would have been spotted and destroyed 
although one unit briefly slipped past the defending force no live 
ammunition or blanks were fired 
the exercise was repeated later monday to give aircraft a chance 
to spot the invading tanks and direct imaginary fire the 1100 
us british and french combat aircraft taking part in imminent 
thunder represent the largest use of aircraft in a training 
exercise since the multinational deployment 
jenkins said sunday the mock aerial attacks were a success but 
there was no media pool coverage of the aerial operation and it was 
impossible to assess from the groundconfusing and everybody needs to understand 
that brig gen mike myatt commander of marine ground forces 
said in a recent interview weve trained marine officers to deal 
with uncertainty if youre used to having 100 percent of 
information before you act youll be defeated 
edward foster a researcher with the londonbased royal united 
services institute for defense studies said any exercise requires 
flexibility 
the biggest amphibious landing ever undertaken the dday 
landing on the normandy coast on june 6 1944 went ahead 24 
hours later than planned because of the weather he said

one big mac hold the dressing 
mcdonalds workers trying to handle a noonhour rush were 
confused when they started getting orders for pink teddies and 
black brassieres instead of big macs and fries 
a glitch sent chatter from an emcee at a nightclub holding a 
lingerie fashion show friday to the headsets worn by workers at 
the mcdonalds next door 
confused ordertakers at mcdonalds heard the solicitations at

gentlemen you can invite the lovely models over to your table 
to investigate the quality of this sexy lingerie i think its 
perfectly ok to let those ladies know with a little financial 
endeavor if you would like to have them come over the emcee 
said

district judge ruled its erotic dancing shows violated a city 
zoning ordinance that prohibits live entertainment in the area of 
the kansas city suburb 
but it reopened friday saying it now would offer a fashion 
show featuring girls girls girls in lingerie and bathing 
suits 
dan eckman the mcdonalds owner made a quick call to

soviet president mikhail gorbachev refusing to 
endorse the use of military force against iraq said today we 
all need patience in the persian gulf crisis 
gorbachev made the statement as he began a meeting with 
president bush during a 34nation summit it appears to dash us 
hopes for winning immediate soviet support for a united nations 
resolution authorizing military action to force iraq out of kuwait 
asked whether he would endorse such a resolution gorbachev 
said well i think we all need patience but that does not mean 
that we are going to relax that we are going to retreat 
bush tried to deflect questions saying he was looking forward 
to their talks and a dinner tonight 
im very pleased with the way the soviet union and the united 
states can work together in the united nations there continues to 
be very openminded communications and i have no reason to be 
anything other than very satisfied bush said 
gorbachev told reporters i think you must know were not 
going to change our position we certainly seek to resolve that 
situation and we must be firm in our position 
as their meeting began at the us embassy residence the lights 
in the building went dark the room was lit by the lights of a 
camera team positioned in the room until the power returned several 
minutes later 
the two leaders had been scheduled to hold a news conference at 
the conclusion of tonights talks but that session was canceled 
without explanation 
earlier in the day bush said he would be willing to provide 
emergency food supplies and humanitarian aid to the soviet union 
saying i worry about the soviet people during the bleak winter 
coming up 
bush made his suggestion in advance of a twohour meeting 
tonight with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose country 
is reeling under political and economic turmoil 
the crisis in the persian gulf also was high on the agenda for 
their talks gorbachev appears far more reluctant than bush to use 
military force to get iraq out of kuwait insisting that diplomacy 
and an economic embargo against baghdad be given more time to work 
in his earlier comments bush said gorbachev has been very 
solid in support of the united nations and the resolutions 
approved by the security council to squeeze iraq with financial 
pressure 
asked about gorbachevs confidence that the gulf crisis can be 
resolved peacefully bush said im anxious to know if theres 
something new that hes thinking of but i cant think what it 
is 
over the past month gorbachev has been touring european 
capitals in search of financial and moral support for his embattled 
program of reforms 
secretary of state james baker said sunday the united states had 
not been asked for food or money but us officials said last week 
they were preparing contingency plans in case of a soviet request 
bush during a morning news conference with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher appeared sympathetic to the plight of 
americas onetime chief adversary 
we would always be openminded on humanitarian aid if theres 
a real need there bush said 
although us law limits direct economic assistance to moscow 
bush said the united states could help alleviate food shortages 
for example 
and thats the right and humane thing to do as a country moves 
towards us and relations are greatly improved and i would want to 
try to help he said 
food rationing will begin next month in leningrad the countrys 
second largest city some smaller cities have been rationing for 
more than a year in moscow some items such as sugar are 
restricted the city council is debating whether to issue coupon 
booklets 
i worry about the soviet people during the bleak winter coming 
up if it proves to be as severe as some of the reports 
indicate bush said 
he said we want to try to help with the evolution of market 
systems and the evolution the change thats taking place and you 
also want to help new friends when you find them if theyre in 
jeopardy

more than 5000 vietnamese boat people staged a 
peaceful sitin at a detention center monday as the high court 
began reviewing the governments policy of screening refugees 
gordon tam of the correctional services department said the 
vietnamese outside the suburban whitehead detention center chanted 
slogans decrying forced repatriation and carried banners saying 
they would rather die than go back to vietnam 
the protesters also said they opposed a new agreement reached in 
september by the un high commissioner for refugees britain and 
vietnam under which hanoi has agreed to accept boat people who do 
not object to returning 
the un agency has said it knows of more than 100 vietnamese 
who do not object to returning home radio hong kong said the first 
such returnees are expected to head for vietnam nov 29 
tam said no trouble was reported during the hourlong 
demonstration at whitehead which houses 24000 vietnamese boat 
people he declined to say if the protest was directly linked to 
mondays high court review of the cases of nine vietnamese 
refugees 
the eight men and one woman are challenging the governments 
policy of screening refugees under the 2yearold policy 
vietnamese who cannot prove they fled vietnam because of religious 
or political persecution face repatriation 
daniel fung lawyer for the nine said immigration officers 
responsible for screening refugees were intolerant impatient and 
ignorant he argued the screening process was flawed and said all 
nine should be granted refugee status 
there are now some 54000 vietnamese in hong kong only about 
8000 of them arrived before the screening policy was introduced

violations of federal safety regulations cost 
railroads and freight shippers more than 83 million in civil 
penalties during a recent 12month period the federal railroad 
administration said monday 
the penalties the highest in a decade included 32 million 
collected for violating regulations on the shipment of hazardous 
materials they were assessed during the 1990 fiscal year which 
ended on sept 30 
the railroad administration imposes civil penalties as a means 
of making management more aware of threats to rail safety 
according to administrator gil carmichael 
he said this approach has been effective leading to significant 
safety improvements since 1978 
the railroad administrator said these include 
a 73 percent decline in train accidents 
a 60 percent decline in hazardous material releases 
a 63 percent decline in onduty employee injuries 
a 60 percent decline in onduty employee fatalities 
the agency also said that since 1978 the rate of train accidents

an average of 10 people have 
died each day this year in political violence making 1990 the 
deadliest year in south africa since widespread unrest erupted six 
years ago researchers said monday 
in a sign of the increasing bloodshed the bodies of 19 men who 
had been hacked and shot were found scattered across a field in a 
black township monday police said they did not know the motive for 
the slayings 
twentyone other people died in unrestrelated attacks over the 
weekend including two white police officers and a black man 
ambushed in a township on the east coast monday officials said 
the independent south african institute of race relations said 
3038 people had been killed in political unrest since january 1 
or about 10 each day that was about three times the daily death 
rate for the same period last year the institute said 
1990 alone already accounts for more than a third of all the 
people killed in political violence over this sixyear period 
since september 1984 the report said 
rioting broke out sept 3 1984 in black townships near 
johannesburg during a work stoppage to protest rent increases the 
unrest spread to other areas of the country as blacks began rising 
up against apartheid policies 
unlike the early years of racial unrest when security forces 
caused most deaths todays victims are usually blacks killed by 
other blacks the institute said 
it said the spillover of black factional fighting from natal 
province to the johannesburg area accounted for much of the 1990 
increase in deaths 
since august more than 800 blacks have died in the townships 
around johannesburg most were victims of clashes between the 
african national congress and the inkatha freedom party 
both groups oppose apartheid but differ on methods for fighting 
it and on their vision for a future south africa 
some township residents said zonkwezizwe outside johannesburg 
had been hit by factional unrest but the motive for the slayings 
of the 19 men found there monday was unclear 
police said there was no report of fighting in zonkwezizwe 
during the weekend and patrols did not detect any trouble sunday 
night when the slayings apparently occurred 
the bodies were in a field about 80 yards from the nearest 
houses heavily armed patrols moved into the township monday to 
prevent further unrest 
also monday police announced they had detained six people 
including three british subjects in connection with an explosion 
near a black taxi stand in pretoria on aug 11 
the explosion injured a dozen people there have been a series 
of bomb attacks in south african cities in recent months and 
police have blamed most of them on rightwing extremists opposed to 
president fw de klerks racial reforms

in the process however we must bear in mind that europe is 
only a part of the world a world whose destinies are shaped not 
only here but beyond the boundaries of our continent in places 
where the winds of change are also making themselves felt the 
worlds overriding objective is building a more secure and 
civilized world so that instead of military force our world order 
would be based on equitable dialogue on a balance of interest and 
on the ability to find a consistent path between sovereignty and 
the integrity of the human race where it stands today 
concern over the survival of the human race is no longer 
centered almost exclusively on removing the threat of nuclear war 
as it was only a short time ago but it is increasingly focused on 
nonmilitary global problems among them the environment energy 
food and water supplies social ills crime mass poverty foreign 
debt and so on what is particularly remarkable is the developing 
international solidarity that is emerging as we tackle all these 
problems however we would be succumbing to impermissible euphoria 
should we conclude that by achieving the great accomplishment that 
having virtually eliminated the threat of a major war in europe we 
thought that we totally ruled out the possibility of conflict in 
the continent 
at the moment each country is in the process of a vigorous 
search for the place it could occupy in a future system this 
search can be productive only if we remain aware of two major 
realities in our world namely that multivalent social and 
political development is not only inevitable but its also 
fruitful and that this cannot be ignored without rendering 
meaningless the principle of freedom of choice because we all need 
and value the partnership and mutual accommodation that are 
incompatible with nationalistic selfishness or parochial 
isolationism 
failure to take into account that multivalent or polyphonic 
aspect of advancement or any attempt to impose any particular way 
of life on someone else as a precondition to be met before 
cooperation is envisaged abound to breed suspicion mistrust 
militant nationalism and reckless separatism that way like 
conflicts animosity the balkanization or even worse the 
lebanization of entire regions either of which would slow down the 
establishment of a shared europe so essential to the european 
process 
therefore it would seem desirable immediately after the paris 
meeting to proceed to the establishment of structures and 
institutions that would be truly capable of shaping the economic 
environmental and technological foundation for a new europe this 
would offer the only truly democratic chance of exerting a positive 
influence on internal developments in a number of countries and 
protecting them from dangerous outbreaks of nationalism and 
separatism 
the claims to territorial changes that result from nationalism 
and separatism would seem particularly unacceptable for once the 
process has begun it may train a destructive snowball effect that 
would throw europe back into the kind of situation which it knows 
only too well from its own history 
while developing into a system of states europe remains a 
continent of countries and nations that are open to cooperation 
with one another in a variety of ways these two factors balance 
each other making for stability in these new conditions 
the notion of a european space covers more than the territory 
from the atlantic to the urals it includes the soviet union as far 
as the pacific as well as the united states and canada 
inseparably linked as they are with the old world by the bonds of 
common history if the european process gains the necessary 
momentum each nation will be able to rely in the foreseeable 
future if we pool our assets on the potential for an 
unprecedentedly powerful community of nations spanning almost the 
whole of the upper part of the globe 
structures the first outline for a european home we favor an 
active and prompt continuation of the vienna negotiations with the 
participation of all 34 states which alongside further cuts in 
their armed forces and changes in the structure of these could 
proceed to the elaboration of new and comprehensive confidence 
building measures 
it would be desirable to combine in the vienna ii framework the 
two negotiating components of the first phase its time we 
broadened their agenda through inclusion of other types of weapons 
above all else naval armaments 
of course the political and psychological changes we have noted 
and welcomed have brought to the fore the issue of tactical nuclear 
weapons in europe we would be prepared to start negotiations on 
that subject within another month or two our proposal jointly to 
give some thought to the concept of what exactly we mean by minimal 
deterrence and where to draw the line beyond which nuclear 
retaliatory capability may develop into an offensive capability is 
indicative of our willingness to proceed gradually towards the 
elimination of that capability without overdramatizing existing 
differences of opinion on the role of nuclear weapons per se 
we are also prepared promptly to set about substantive 
discussions of the open skies issue 
the situation of europe is in transience it will apparently 
take some time before were able to grasp all the changes taking 
place in our day but what counts is our shared understanding that 
it must be a time of peaceful change that is why starting work on 
institutionalizing the european process would be one of the major 
practical results to stem from this meeting

among the trailblazing decisions to set up a threetier 
mechanism i would wish to single out the conflict prevention 
center designed to provide settlements as it were for 
politicalmilitary situations that might arise we find it highly 
promising as it may gradually develop into a kind of alleuropean 
security council that would have effective means to extinguish the 
sparks of any possible conflict 
the two years between now and helsinki ii will be a trial period 
to test the unprecedented mechanism for european interactions to be 
set in motion here in paris understanding an agreement on the role 
played by the united states and the soviet union appear to be of 
the greatest importance during the transitional period no matter 
what difficulties the soviet union may face today it will remain a 
great world and european factor playing an innovative and 
stabilizing role in line with its huge potential 
on the subject of the military alliances the warsaw treaty 
organization and nato the warsaw treaty member countries are 
likely to take important decisions before the end of this year on 
transforming the organization and changing its character it is of 
course for the nato member countries to take any nato related 
decisions hopefully the transformation of the alliance as already 
announced will assume a bolder attitude in taking stock of the 
profound and apparently irreversible changes underway in europe 
the outcome of the decisions were about to take here will to a 
great extent depend on the attitude and activity of existing 
international structure which has proved effective and gained 
useful inaudible im referring here to the european 
community the council of europe european parliamentary 
institutions western european and international economic 
organizations nongovernment research and information centers and 
of course interparty and interlabor associations 
both their ability to adapt in new developments and also the 
willingness and ability to cooperate with them of nonmembers 
constitutes a highly complex issue that needs time before it can be 
properly tackled particularly in the light of the huge gap in the 
social economic legacy of the various european countries and the 
critical situation prevalent in many of them today 
formulated imperative of solidarity is what we need and what this 
forum convened in the interest of all of europe urges on those 
who will take part in the alleuropean process covering the areas 
ive outlined about profound changes in the soviet union will 
increasingly generate the necessary preconditions for rapprochement 
with the european community 
i should also add that the arch of cooperation were beginning 
to develop around the northern hemisphere would be inconceivable 
without developing new relationships between the soviet union and 
japan 
and finally a word on yet another subject which is not on our 
agenda iraqs aggressions have become the second serious test as 
we begin our movements towards a new period of peace in history 
our unity in condemning it and our shared concern over the 
outcome of the crisis are also indicative of the radical shift in 
our midst and the perception of the goals of and the meanings 
available to world politics any armed attack wherever it may 
occur now serves to unite us rather than scatter us on different 
sides of the barricade 
demanding that the aggressor withdraw from kuwait we are 
defending the hopes that millions of people have begun to pin on 
the ability of the international community to cope with even the 
most critical of conflicts if we disappoint these hopes much of 
what we have accomplished in the past few years would be in 
jeopardy were prepared to show patience in the quest for a 
political solution but we will remain firm and determined in 
implementing the will of the united nations 
ladies and gentlemen the peoples of europe the united states 
and canada have resolved to create a common historical entity 
based on shared principles and purposes on democracy and humanism 
may i congratulate you therefore on that major first step and 
wish you all success the revival of the spirit of international 
solidarity that was kindled during the war and that inspired the 
founders of the united nations raises the hope that what we then 
conceived of will ultimately prevail 
and it is most important for the united nations and its security 
council to take up at long last the purpose for which they were 
originally designed and i would like to welcome in our midst the 
most distinguished guest mr perez de cuellar who has done so 
much to revive the role of the united nations 
i would also like to express our gratitude to the leaders of 
france and personally to president francois mitterrand for their 
warmth and hospitality as well as their excellent preparations for 
this meeting thank you

submit any standardized test scores for admission 
bates a small liberal arts college in lewiston maine thus 
became only the second highlyselective college in the nation with 
no standardized admissions test requirements the other bowdoin 
is also a small liberal arts college in maine 
bates made the sat optional in 1984 but entering freshmen who 
didnt submit sat scores had to submit either three achievement 
test scores or the american college test or act 
bates faculty earlier this month voted 941 to make all 
admissions testing optional admissions dean william c hiss said 
in a telephone interview monday starting with freshmen entering in 
september 1991 applicants can choose whether to submit any test 
scores 
in a statement monday the college board which sponsors the sat 
and numerous standardized achievement tests called bates decision 
curious in light of the emphasis being placed on subject 
matter knowledge in college admissions discussions 
about a hundred colleges have made sat and act scores optional 
for admission according to fairtest a cambridge massbased 
organization that keeps tabs on those requirements but many of 
those recommend taking those tests or else require them for 
placement purposes some require applicants to take achievement 
tests in lieu of sats 
but a fiveyear study at bates found that the optional sat 
policy had no negative impact on the quality of its entering 
freshman and in fact had improved the student mix hiss said 
minority enrollments increased from 5 percent to 10 percent 
hiss said the optional testing policy also has helped the school 
attract bright students who cant afford sat coaching courses as 
well as bright youngsters whose minds arent geared to standardized 
testtaking hiss said 
he cited the case of a valedictorian from a rural maine high 
school who nonetheless had poor verbal sats and might have been 
rejected if bates put a premium on test scores 
the thing you had to know about this boy was that he was the 
nations youngest emergency medical service instructor at age 16 
what does this tell you about his ability to think through 
complicated scientific questions and supervise people twice his 
age as an applicant i thought he looked just great for bates 
thats why were doing this

a naked man strategically covered with straw 
peers out from the cover of playgirl magazine on a rack outside the 
citys granitepillared cultural center 
but whatever culture rick graffs ramshackle newsstand offers is 
lost on city officials who are evicting it after more than 70 
years of business 
you cant miss the place loyal customers call a landmark a 
peeling greypainted wood shack packed with thousands of 
publications ranging from good housekeeping to revolutionary 
worker 
graff says its one of the nations largest newsstands dozens 
of metal stands filled with magazines spill out onto the sidewalk 
magazines with more revealing covers than playgirl are partially 
hidden behind a rickety wall inside the shack 
wearing dark glasses that prompt chuckles from passersby 
graffs two dogs an alaskan malamute named tasha and rocky the 
shepherdhuskie lie vigilantly on a soiled reddish carpet between 
the shack and the cultural centers steps 
its not very attractive commissioner benjamin reyes ofthe 
citys general services department said monday he sent graff an 
eviction notice last week 
the primary reason is the stand has no legal permit to operate 
out of that location reyes said 
graff said permits were not needed when the stand opened more 
than 70 years ago and even if he sought one now we would not 
authorize any permits for vendors operating around one of our 
facilities reyes said 
the policy is part of the citys new beautification effort and 
graff is not being singled out the commissioner said 
but graff 28 maintains the eviction is an effort to stifle the 
working class 
they want to make this a party palace for the rich graff 
said motioning toward the renovated blocklong cultural center 
where lectures poetry readings and art exhibits are held 
reyes said the city offered to lease a store to graff in a 
nearby underground pedestrian mall but graff who bought the 
stand for 50000 seven years ago and pays no rent said no dice 
the city rejected his proposal to build a spiffier stand on the 
site and graff contends moving it would destroy the stands major 
selling points its unique atmosphere and strategic location 
between a commuter train station and the downtown subway and 
elevated train tracks 
its not only a great newsstand but a family can come here 
and actually have fun theres comics for kids hundreds of 
magazines and people can come here and pet my dogs graff said 
youre not going to close down are you william brady a 
36yearold janitor asked as he bought a paper i dont think 
its an eyesore its a landmark 
reyes said the case is closed but graff is seeking an attorney 
to fight the eviction 
he doesnt have much time the eviction orders him to leave by 
january 14 
i sure would hate to see it go said shirley goldman a 
retired teacher who remembers shopping at the stand 30 years ago 
its real memorabilia

slightly cheaper mortgages will be available 
to more home buyers next year because of an increase in the size of 
singlefamilyhome loans purchased by secondary market agencies 
the federal national mortgage association fannie mae said 
monday it will purchase mortgages as large as 191250 starting 
jan 1 up from a 187450 ceiling this year in alaska and hawaii 
the ceiling will be 50 percent higher 
the board of the federal home loan mortgage corp freddie mac 
is expected to approve a similar increase when it meets in early 
december spokeswoman audra capas said 
together the two stockholderowned but 
congressionallychartered companies finance one in four of the 
nations residential mortgages they purchase mortgages from 
lenders holding some and repackaging others into securities for 
sale to investors 
lenders are able to charge interest rates a quarter to a 
halfpoint lower on mortgages they sell to the companies compared 
with loans they retain in their own portfolios 
the ceiling increase wont mean much in most regions but in 
highcost areas such as california the northeast where the average 
mortgage is near the limit it will help buyers a bit 
a home buyer with a mortgage at the new ceiling would save 73 a 
month with a fixedrate loan of 9 percent instead of 10 percent 
for instance 
twofamilyhome residential mortgages will have a limit of 
244650 threefamily 295650 and fourfamily 367500 
the practical effect of this is positive said james w 
nelson president of the mortgage bankers association of america 
he estimated that the higher limits will enable roughly 25000 
families to take advantage of slightly lower mortgage rates 
in the midwest and west markets have tended to be a little 
stronger than elsewhere and as housing prices go up it helps make 
financing more available for a certain segment of the homebuying 
public he said 
the new singlefamily ceiling is based on data collected by the 
federal housing finance board which said monday that the average 
sales price for a singlefamily home was 139600 in october up 2 
percent from 136800 a year earlier the loan ceilings increase 
proportionately 
through the 1980s the fannie mae and freddie mac ceilings have 
risen rapidly along with housing prices falling for the first time 
in 1990 the singlefamily ceiling was 187450 in 1990 187600 
in 1989 168700 in 1988 153100 in 1987 133250 in 1986 and 
115000 in 1985

nationalists appeared headed for 
victory over communists in bosniahercegovinas first free 
elections in more than a halfcentury according to returns made 
public monday 
the serbian democratic alliance the croatian democratic union 
and the moslem union for democratic action were running well ahead 
of the communist party and federal premier ante markovics alliance 
of reform forces 
with 20 percent of the vote counted in the central republic the 
moslem party was leading in three bosnian constituencies the 
croats and the serbs were ahead in two each 
the 240 seats in bosnias bicameral parliament are divided among 
seven constituencies final results were not expected for several 
days and no single nationalist party seemed likely to win a clear 
majority 
at a news conference leaders of the serbian croatian and 
moslem parties said they would cooperate on major political and 
economic issues 
moslem party leader alija izetbegovic suggested the three 
parties form a government coalition 
im delighted that bosnia is finally free and that we can 
start working for the benefit of all nationalities living in the 
region said stjepan kljujic leader of the croatian democratic 
union 
the communists were rejected in bosnias elections because of 
the disastrous consequences of their 45 years of monopoly on 
power said radovan karadzic president of the serbian democratic 
alliance this is a victory for democracy 
zlatko lajundzia a member of the communist partys presidium 
said it is obvious that the nationalist parties are doing much 
better than we and they had expected 
supporters well ahead the two parties had claimed victory for a 
nationalist party could lead to civil war 
western observers said the elections in which about 70 percent 
of the electorate cast ballots sunday were free and generally 
fair it was the regions first free elections since 1938 
except for some isolated incidences in general the elections 
seem to have been carried out fairly said david evans a senior 
adviser for a us congressional commission monitoring human rights 
and security in europe 
bosniahercegovina whose 42 million people include serbs 
croats and moslems is geographically and politically at the heart 
of yugoslavias bitter rivalries 
sarajevo bosnias capital is best known for the assassination 
of austrohungarian archduke franz ferdinand by a young nationalist 
in 1914 his killing sparked world war i 
serbia and croatia are the two largest yugoslav republics and 
they flank bosniahercegovina they have previously made 
territorial claims on the central republic 
serbia under communist rule pending elections dec 9 wants to 
keep power centralized in belgrade the serbian and federal 
capital croatia where the croatian democratic union defeated the 
communists in spring elections wants yugoslavia to become a 
confederation of nearly independent states 
bosnia has so far steered a neutral and independent course 
catholic croats and the orthodox serbs since yugoslavia was founded 
as a kingdom in 1918 during the nazi occupation of world war ii 
bosnia was the scene of a civil war among croats serbs communists 
and the occupying germans

here are excerpts of mondays testimony by 
sen dennis deconcini before the senate ethics committee 
all of the evidence that has been admitted as i understand 
now that lies over there some 44 volumes this information 
contains heresay it contains rumors unfounded allegations 
about all the senators i dare say 
now mr chairman i regret that i have to mention and make 
reference to mr bennett special counsel robert s bennett 
because of the manner in which he presented the case thursday and 
friday he wants a victory he wants to nail somebody he wants 
to get somebody im sorry to say he wants another trophy on the 
wall 
but it has been said many times this is not a trial this is 
supposed to be a factfinding hearing where we get an opportunity 
to lay our case out for you and the american public 
constituent service to me is very important and when a 
constituent someone from arizona walks in to my office we have 
no discrimination whether they are republican democrat liberal 
conservative rich poor even if they are not registered voters 
if theyve got a complaint we listen to them 
what is wrong with intervention from someone who sends you a 
check to your campaign nothing no more different than what is 
wrong when american continental or their employees sent checks to 
our campaigns they didnt hand the checks to us and talk about it 
weve handled 75000 constituent cases in the 14 years that i 
have been a senator and we havent discriminated and we dont 
talk money with them 
now let me talk about the case of american continental and 
lincoln they came to me as they did to other people argued their 
problem and their case saying they were being mistreated and i 
said to them give me some evidence so what did they do 
they got me some pretty powerful evidence all us pretty 
powerful evidence 
i decided to intervene thats right i got in there with my 
sleeves up and decided to go for it 
all the regulators pointed out we did nothing improper 
there was no change made by what we attempted to persuade them to 
do or bring to their attention we didnt do anything wrong in 
any meetings we acted as senators should have they werent 
intimidated until a couple of years later when they got darn 
worried that they hadnt done their jobs 
i was asked to make a status inquiry and i did there were jobs 
involved this was a major employer 
ive had to say some things that are difficult to say about a 
brother lawyer a fine prosecutor as far as i know by reputation 
but ive been mistreated by him in this process 
to do other than dismiss the charges against me is unjust i 
broke no law i broke no rule i broke no standard i committed no 
improper conduct

lech walesa exuding confidence six days 
before the countrys first popular presidential election declared 
monday that he was born only for victory 
the solidarity chairman ahead in the polls against his former 
ally prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and four others said his 
struggle has already been successful because it has forced an 
acceleration of change in poland 
the 47yearold electrician from gdansk rose to international 
prominence more than a decade ago when he led the tradeunion 
movement that sparked enormous political changes in poland 
the solidarity movement also helped spark revolutions elsewhere 
in eastern europe that ended decades of communist rule but now the 
movement is splintered 
walesa in an interview with the associated press said one of 
his first moves as president would be to try to unite solidarity 
again but he said he would avoid abrupt changes until postwar 
polands first free parliamentary elections expected within three 
months 
mazowiecki contends polands future depends on maintaining his 
course of determined but cautious reform and that he will join the 
opposition if walesa wins the presidency on sunday or in a dec 9 
runoff 
walesa has waged a pugnacious campaign against a government he 
largely created he proposed mazowiecki as the east blocs first 
noncommunist prime minister in august 1989 and then found himself 
on the sidelines chafing at what he saw as a tooslow pace of 
reforms 
then when i said ill take over power ill become 
president everything started moving he said so didnt i 
accelerate everything 
he launched his presidential campaign initially criticized but 
then leading to former communist party leader wojciech jaruzelskis 
decision to step down early as president 
dangerous policy that was on the edge of civil war i made an 
attempt to save us to save reform he said 
virtually all walesas former advisers have sided with 
mazowiecki leaving walesa to assemble a new campaign team of 
unionists and lesserknown politicians but now victory appears 
within grasp 
walesa a peasants son with a tradeschool education said he 
differs from his former colleagues most of them from intellectual 
circles because he is not frightened by ordinary people and wants 
to engage them in the political process 
if you fear the masses then of course the masses will defeat 
you he said i am not afraid of the masses i want to find 
work for them and i want to show them whats possible or 
impossible and then go on with whats possible and probable 
he said that if some day he sees a demonstration in front of his 
presidential palace i will come out and lead it 
walesa deflected a question about whether he would ask finance 
minister leszek balcerowicz architect of polands shock economic 
overhaul to stay on if he is victorious 
without naming names he said part of mazowieckis present 
cabinet could remain if he wins but he said he would not be doing 
any begging 
asked why he had not done more to rebuke antisemitic 
questioners during his rallies walesa said he had reminded poles 
in recent interviews that antisemitism is contradictory to their 
catholicism 
of his past and future political battles walesa said bluntly 
i was born only for victory so i have to win 
maybe you see it as overconfidence but if so let me remind 
you of my first statement last summer which today makes sense 
even if it didnt thento be the president 
it could be seen as conceit trickery or pride but in fact it 
was the key with which i got the reform process moving 
he said he dreamed of uniting solidarity again 
i have been struggling for nine months to regain solidaritys 
position and to regain my position he said i do not know to 
what extent it worked but from what i see it did

contempt fines levied against cnn should be used to 
pay for manuel noriegas defense against drug smuggling charges an 
attorney for the deposed panamanian dictator said monday 
on sunday the us supreme court left intact a federal judges 
temporary order that barred cnn from airing tapes of jailhouse 
phone conversations between noriega and his defense team 
contempt of court hearing against cnn in view of the us supreme 
courts 72 decision 
the defense has asked for fines of 300000 per airing of the 
conversations and may said it will ask that money be used for a 
noriega defense trust fund 
were certainly going to suggest that might be one way of 
solving a lot of problems and i think an appropriate one 
considering the fact that general noriegas defense was damaged by 
cnn may said 
that could allow noriega to keep his private defense team even 
though his funds have been frozen by federal prosecutors and 
foreign governments 
us district judge william hoeveler said last week he would 
decide soon whether to replace noriegas private attorneys with 
governmentpaid counsel the private attorneys have said they 
cannot stay on the case without some money 
steven korn chief counsel for cnns parent company turner 
broadcasting system inc said the network had no position on how 
any fines it might pay should be dispersed because it doesnt 
expect to pay any 
he said the network never aired privileged conversations under 
hoevelers order 
i think that point has been lost in the hue and cry korn 
said he noted that lead noriega attorney frank rubino had 
identified and described the conversation on the air and even 
pushed the button on the tape recorder 
hoeveler meanwhile has set a hearing for tuesday on how to 
proceed with the prison tapes at the center of the cnnnoriega 
dispute 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said monday the tapes were being 
blown out of proportion 
this is not as grand an issue as it is described as being 
lehtinen said i think the taping by the government will be found 
to be quite correct privileged conversations are not 
privileged when you get on a phone from a prison and you know it 
is being taped 
he said the judge may well rule the tapes are not prejudicial to 
noriegas case 
may said that such a ruling would neither keep hoeveler from 
finding cnn in contempt nor end the gag order 
between attorneys and a client may said 
noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the 
taping the freezing of his assets and other alleged government 
misconduct but hoeveler has not ruled on the issue 
noriega is jailed outside of miami on a drugtrafficking 
indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to turn panama into a 
way station for usbound cocaine shipments he has been held more 
than 10 months and his trial isnt expected to begin before next 
spring

the cause of surprisingly high levels of 
chemical pollutants found in some north pacific sea lions is a 
mystery a federal official said monday 
chemical runoff from as far south as the washington and oregon 
coasts could be responsible for contaminants found in two of eight 
alaskan steller sea lions tested in what is considered pristine 
alaskan waters said roddy moscoso of the national marine fisheries 
service 
but he said there was no evidence that points to an actul 
source and studies are continuing 
their diet various fish species do traverse a great deal of 
the west coast down into washington it is possible through runoffs 
in washington state and oregon in the migratory area that they 
could have been exposed to such levels moscoso said it is a 
mystery right now 
the study of a small sample of 23 animals was conducted by usha 
varanasi director of the services environmental conservation 
division in seattle 
high levels of contaminants have been found in pilot whales 
stranded on the coast of new england but those levels were not 
surprising given the water quality in that area moscoso said 
however the contaminants in the steller sea lions were cause 
for alarm 
we would have considered where they live to be in a pristine 
environment so it was of concern because we just had not idea the 
contaminant concentrations would be that high he said

fire in front of the us capitol as dozens of bystanders watched 
police said

had not been identified the reason for the suicide was not 
immediately known 
he stood for quite awhile said a tourist from iowa who saw 
the man on fire as she walked out of the capitol a lot of people 
were watching it was pretty gruesome 
the woman who would not give her name said the man lay down

it was awful she said adding that someone in the crowd 
yelled that the fire department should be called 
officer dan nichols of the capitol police said an officer at the 
door called for help 
nichols said the man used some sort of accelerant to feed 
the flames which also were hastened by a brisk wind that was 
blowing the man was pronounced dead at the scene 
the incident occurred about 2 pm on an expansive landing part 
way up the steps of the west front of the building facing the mall 
that stretches from the capitol to the lincoln memorial 
though the capitol is the scene of frequent protests the 
incident did not appear connected to any political cause nichols 
said 
congress is not in session reducing the amount of activity 
around the building 
nichols said police made a sweep of the area with canine teams 
in an effort to find something that would identify the victim and 
to make certain the man didnt leave any dangerous devices or 
materials on the grounds

the corcoran gallery of art in turmoil since 
the cancellation of a robert mapplethorpe exhibit on friday named 
a new york art historian and education administrator as its new 
leader 
david c levy chancellor of the new school for social research 
was elected by the corcoran board of trustees to become director 
and president of the gallery and the art school affiliated with it 
starting jan 1 
levy 52 joined the parsons school of design in 1961 he 
initiated the merger of parsons and the new school in 1970 and 
continued as parsons chief administrative officer until last year 
besides being an art historian and experienced administrator 
levy is also a photographer and an active jazz musician performing 
on saxophone throughout the united states and abroad 
levys appointment was announced in conjunction with a policy 
statement in which the board reaffirmed the corcorans commitment 
to freedom of expression 
the corcoran board said the gallery is solely responsible for 
the appropriateness or acceptability of its exhibits criticism 
or objections must not prevent an idea from being voiced a work 
from being seen or a performance from being held the board 
said 
the corcoran located only two blocks from the white house near 
pennsylvania ave is 120 years old and the oldest museum in 
washington 
it attracted nationwide criticism when its former director 
christina orrcahall canceled a controversial exhibit containing 
sexually explicit photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
she said she canceled the show two weeks before it was 
scheduled to open in the summer of 1989 to avoid getting embroiled 
in the emotional debate over federal arts grant policies but the 
cancellation ignited an equally intense debate in the artistic 
community and orrcahall resigned last february 
a federal grant had helped finance the traveling mapplethorpe 
exhibit which contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and 
pictures of nude children 
the exhibit appeared without incident in philadelphia and 
chicago before it was supposed to arrive in washington but in a 
subsequent stop in cincinnati the gallery owner was arrested and 
tried for violating obscenity laws a jury acquitted him but the 
debate over federal arts funding still rages 
the corcoran board had been searching for a director since 
orrcahall announced last december she would be resigning 
levy issued a statement echoing the institutions renewed 
commitment to freedom of artistic expression it is my 
unequivocal position that these freedoms must be jealously guarded 
and i see it as my obligation to put that belief into 
practice he said

wheat production in 1991 will be down from 
this years nearrecord harvest an agriculture department report 
said monday 
prospects now point to decidedly lower production next year 
the departments economic research service said 
the report said the area planted for the 1991 wheat crop will be 
reduced and there is no assurance that the 1990 record yield 
per acre will be replicated 
however analysts said the total us supply of wheat in the 
199192 marketing year which will begin june 1 will be bolstered 
by much larger stocks left from previous harvests 
the 1991 idling requirement was set in the new farm bill at 15 
percent of a farmers wheat acreage base compared with a 5 percent 
requirement setaside this year 
no forecast of 1991 wheat production was included in the report 
this years output was more than 274 billion bushels up 35 
percent from the droughtreduced 1989 harvest 
the report projected the total us wheat stockpile next june 1 
at 945 million bushels up from 536 million bushels last june 1 
a 15 percent level for the 1991 wheat acreage reduction program 
or arp would result in four to five times more wheat area 
idled than the approximately two million acres idled in 1990 
under the program the report said 
farmers must participate in the program and idle part of their 
acreage to qualify for price supports and other program benefits

two inspectors from the international 
atomic energy agency are visiting iraq at the invitation of the 
baghdad government which wants the agency to verify it is not 
developing nuclear weapons 
the iraqi news agency quoted inspector abdul wahid alsaji as 
saying he and the other inspector were on a nov 1822 visit to 
conduct their regular comprehensive inspection of the nuclear 
installations and materials in iraq 
alsaji said it was the second visit to iraq this year by the 
viennabased iaea the agency has said it found no violations by 
iraq during an april visit 
the inspectors are apparently checking on a 27pound mass of 
highly enriched uranium that iraq salvaged from the osirak nuclear 
reaction which was destroyed by an israeli air attack in 1981 
scientists say this uranium could be fashioned into a primitive 
nuclear bomb 
the iraqi governments invitation to the iaea appeared aimed at 
stripping away one justification for an invasion of iraq some 
western officials have said that regardless of kuwaits status the 
middle east will never be safe as long as president saddam hussein 
could threaten to use nuclear weapons 
researchers have claimed for years that iraq is trying to 
develop a nuclear bomb tel aviv universitys jaffee center for 
strategic studies published a report sunday that iraq is capable of 
developing such a wepaon within three to five years 
iraq is a signatory of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty that 
binds nations to renounce the possession or use of nuclear weapons 
and to submit to regular inspections of their uranium by iaea 
officials

despite economic gloom and higher fuel prices 
american drivers plan to hit the road in higher numbers this 
thanksgiving but the nations airlines arent expecting a similar 
surge 
the american automobile association reported monday that more 
people are expecting to drive 100 miles or more for thanksgiving 
based on a survey of 1500 adults 
the airlines meanwhile are predicting no improvement over last 
year a discouraging sign forsluggish demand and steady increases in jet 
fuel prompted by the 
persian gulf crisis 
historically we have exceeded the previous year but this 
year we think well be flat said stephen hayes of the air 
transport association of america 
even though gasoline prices have risen by nearly 30 cents a 
gallon since iraq invaded kuwait in august aaa pointed out that an 
automobile that gets 20 miles a gallon can go 100 miles for less 
than 7 
about 225 million people 9 percent of the population will 
drive to holiday feasts aaa said the number should be 3 percent 
higher than a year ago although thanksgiving travel is generally 
down from levels of the mid1980s the aaa said 
when the economy suffers people are less likely to plan trips 
aaa spokesman geoff sundstrom said but the auto club was surprised 
that higher gasoline prices dont seem to be having much of an 
impact 
we often hear analysts talk about the psychological effects of 
higher gas prices but we havent seen it in holiday travel 
sundstrom said 
aaa estimated that the number of people making thanksgiving 
trips by airplanes and on trains and buses would stay the same this 
year at about 35 million 
im sure the fuel prices have had an effect hayes said air 
transport theres no question but that were suffering from both 
an economic slowdown and sharply rising jet fuel prices because of 
those two we are seeing some falloff in traffic 
hayes association estimated a total of 9 million boardings will 
occur from tuesday to monday for a rough total of 45 million 
people making round trips the figures are for all boardings so 
many of those travelers might not be taking thanksgiving trips 
even though the overall figures are staying the same numbers 
are off at some airlines 
twa for example anticipates some 22000 passengers will go 
through its st louis hub wednesday and 26600 will pass through 
sunday the comparable figures a year ago were 27000 and 30000 on 
those days which are among the most heavily traveled spokesman 
jim faulkner said 
with the state of the economy a lot of people are opting to 
drive who may have flown in years past faulkner said most of 
the airlines are cutting capacity because many of them have too 
many seats out there 
after the gulf crisis sent oil prices spiraling airlines 
responded with fare increases totaling about 15 percent even 
though many passengers took advantage of discount tickets offered 
before the increases kicked in the higher fares might be 
discouraging to some 
even in tough times its hard to keep people home on the 
holidays according to the head of the american society of travel 
agents 
thanksgiving travel is close to being a necessity said the 
groups president philip davidoff even when things are tight 
people will go home anyway 
some travel agents agree 
when i look back at a prior recession we had no reduction 
of people deciding to travel said h wayne berens president of 
revere travel inc based in trenton nj 
of course you cant go to grandmas if youve been shipped to 
the saudi desert and berens thinks the troop buildup in the middle 
east may be having an impact 
it takes out another quarter million people from the potential 
traveling public berens said but it means dependents arent 
traveling either

new york a man who bilked more than 133000 from dozens of 
roman catholic priests around the country by telling them hardluck 
stories has been sent to prison for two years and ordered to pay 
full restitution 
robert riggio was sentenced last week and ordered to pay 
restitution of 133606 to his victims 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum also ordered riggio 
described as a compulsive gambler to join gamblers anonymous 
from may 1987 to last march riggio posed as a parishioner with 
family troubles and convinced nearly 50 priests nationwide to wire 
him loans ranging from 200 to 20000 
riggio did most of his work over the telephone persuading the 
priests to wire money or arranging for messengers to pick up the 
cash court records said 
obviously he took advantage of peoples better nature for his 
own gain one victim the rev michael huerter of st louis 
catholic church in upstate pittsford said in a telephone interview 
monday 
hes a thief thats the long and short of the story said 
another victim the rev charles brady of cody wyo 
brady wired riggio 2000 after a late night telephone call in 
which riggio poed as a local resident who needed money to keep his 
daughter from being kicked out of an east coast university 
fbi officials arrested riggio 44 of new york city in april 
and he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in june he 
promised to repay his victims but never did court papers said 
investigators said riggio who is separated from his wife and 
has two sons ages 25 and 15 apparently used the money to pay 
gambling debts 
because riggio always seemed wellinformed about each parish 
huerter said he believed that he had consulted a national directory 
of catholic churches which lists priests and other church 
officials 
the rev bryan dalton of st richards catholic church in miami 
got his phone call last december 
the caller claiming to have met dalton at a recent mass said 
he needed money because his mother had been mugged the night 
before 
i had a suspicion when i went to western union but i thought 
id give the guy the benefit of the doubt said dalton who lost 
650 
the priest who lost the most was the rev donald w simmons of 
st anns catholic church in bonners ferry idaho he wired riggio 
a total of 20000 in 10 payments between oct 6 1989 and nov 
20 1989 
simmons declined to be interviewed when reached by telephone on 
monday

for some world leaders the 34nation summit here 
offers a welcome respite from troubles at home 
britains margaret thatcher soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
frances premier michel rocard polands tadeusz mazowiecki all 
would rather be in paris acting statesmanlike than deal with 
domestic political challenges 
but they needed go no further than sidewalk news stands for a 
reminder 
rocard facing censure the influential paris daily le figaro 
headlined further down on the front page it carried a large 
article on mrs thatchers challenger as the man who scares 
thatcher 
the leaders feigned indifference when asked whether she would 
like to be remembered for her role in the current summit mrs 
thatcher not known for her love of european affairs bristled i 
think ill be remembered for a lot more than that but its not 
time to write memoirs yet 
gorbachev lauded by world leaders and applauded by a paris 
crowd looked every inch the statesman only his occasionally glum 
visage and a warning on the dangers of ethnic passions betrayed the 
woes that have him pounding the lecterns and hurriedly revamping 
his government at home 
like gorbachev many of the east european leaders in paris are 
threatened by winter food and energy shortages that could combine 
with rising ethnic passions to stir violence and chaos 
the glumness of bare stores and stoic queues the dimness of 
cities like bulgarias sofia now suffering power cuts 50 percent 
of the time are hard to imagine in the vibrant gleaming french 
capital 
official lunches like that monday at the elysee palace or 
tuesday nights planned dinner and ballet soiree at versailles are 
something beyond the imagination of millions of soviets and east 
europeans 
leaders like romanias president ion iliescu attending his 
first big european gathering could try only to offer the folks 
back home the novel comfort of acceptance in the international 
community iliescu demonstratively put an arm round french host 
francois mitterrand when posing for pictures 
western leaders too could take solace in the paris 
proceedings 
mrs thatcher on tuesday faces the most serious challenge of her 
11 years in office in a contest with her former defense secretary 
michael heseltine for the leadership of the conservative party 
president bush helped out a little monday morning scheduling a 
breakfast with thatcher that thrust her into the international 
limelight heseltine has lacked since he quit thatchers government 
in disgust in 1986 
yet bush also needs the paris proceedings to bolster his policy 
on the persian gulf and help fend off questions at home about 
whether or not the united states should contemplate war to get iraq 
out of kuwait bush himself has seen his popularity plummet in the 
face of newly enacted tax increases and a looming recession 
another western leader under fire is the french premier rocard 
buffeted by massive student demonstrations in the past two weeks 
and threatened monday by a parliamentary motion of no confidence 
for the first time rightists and communists were united in 
opposing the socialist premier but their effort fell five votes 
short of an absolute majority in the 577seat national assembly 
the motions failure allowed rocards 2yearold government to 
survive but his future remains uncertain 
the drama of the leaders sideshows barely penetrated the wall 
of security and protocol that serves to keep them isolated during 
the threeday summit 
gorbachev made only the most glancing of references to soviet 
woes then quickly pledged that any difficulties would not diminish 
his countrys importance on the world stage 
but leaders from both west and east seemed alert to the multiple 
dangers to the new democracy they gathered in paris to celebrate 
on monday afternoon speaker after speaker alluded to the 
dangers of nationalism the poverty facing the east and the 
resulting mass migration to an unprepared west 
perhaps most striking was gorbachevs warning that nationalism 
and separatism could have a destructive snowball effect if any 
government gives way to them

iraq on monday tempered its plan to release 
all foreign hostages between christmas and march and also declined 
to guarantee the safety of westerners still hiding in kuwait 
information minister latif nassayif jassim indicated a un 
resolution authorizing a military offensive could jeopardize the 
hostage release 
at the same time the minister hinted the socalled hostage 
bazaar is still open for business in iraq that the country might 
barter the release of some foreigners in exchange for medicine and 
other considerations from switzerland 
later the government announced that an unspecified number of 
swiss would be allowed to leave in appreciation of a swiss 
delegations visit to baghdad 
jassim also denounced the us and british description of the 
hostage release as a ploy 
the rulers of britain and the united states do not want peace 
in the region or resolution of its problems on a comprehensive 
basis jassim said 
iraq referred to its hostage release plan as a gesture for 
peace but on monday the government announced new plans in case of 
war 
iraqs general command after a meeting chaired by president 
saddam hussein announced it was sending seven new divisions to 
kuwait and calling up 150000 reservists for eventual duty in the 
occupied country 
the statement said the decision taken in response to the 
recently announced addition of 200000 american forces in the 
region would add about 250000 troops to the 430000 already in 
kuwait and southern iraq 
hussein decided sunday that all foreign hostages would be freed 
in batches beginning dec 25 if nothing happens to disturb the 
atmosphere of peace 
if during the departure period an attack would take place 
then of course the departures would be affected said jassim 
but the minister declined to say if something short of an 
attack such as passage of a un resolution authorizing 
offensives would be enough to disrupt the planned hostage 
releases 
we are watching the situation said jassim when asked if 
such a resolution would block the plan 
jassim at a news conference also declined to guarantee that 
westerners in kuwait could emerge from hiding without risking 
arrest and relocation to a potential military target five germans 
and two americans reportedly were arrested saturday in kuwait 
this is a procedural thing that is not related to the 
political attitude said jaseem every foreigner should report 
to iraqi authorities so they can be registered and protected by 
iraqi authorities this is a matter of rules and regulations 
iraqi officials have detained hundreds of foreigners whom they 
call guests at strategic sites around the country to deter an 
attack by the allied forces in saudi arabia diplomats in baghdad 
say there are at least 104 americans and 353 britons held at such 
sites 
hundreds of other foreigners are being kept in iraq and kuwait 
against their will by the iraqi government 
jassim said that the release applied to all foreign hostages 
still western hostages interviewed in baghdad said they were not 
optmistic 
i think the timing is very cunning stretching from christmas 
to ramadan said one westerner who asked not to be identified 
i dont think they the americans and the british will go for 
it 
it didnt really generate any jumping up and down everybody 
is conditioned now to take just about everything with a great deal 
of thought said roland burgheer a 62yearold american living 
in a diplomatic safe house with an undisclosed number of other 
americans 
its nice to think about but it didnt really generate a lot 
of excitement said burgheer a lot of things have transpired 
here in the past that might have suggested the same thing 
i dont personally care to be let go if it involves 
negotiations of some kind he said 
jassim however showed no reluctance for certain types of 
negotiations he said a deal to release 24 swiss nationals 25 
employees of swiss companies and up to 150 other foreigners 
depended on reaching agreement on medical supplies and other 
considerations from the swiss 
this question depends on several arrangements up for 
consideration they are dealing with arrangements for holding a 
peace conference in switzerland and some medical supplies for 
iraq jassim said 
a delegation of five swiss politicians led by edgar oehler a 
christian democrat has been negotiating for the release he said 
the swiss acting privately but still respecting the un embargo on 
iraq and swiss policy have offered geneva as a site for an 
international peace conference and other unspecified concessions 
sources who declined to be identified hinted the deal may 
involve a shipment of up to 12 tons of medical supplies 
oehler said he had given the iraqis a list of about 200 
foreigners including 36 americans that he hoped to take out of 
the country the iraqis he said had insisted that the arrangement 
be approved by the swiss government 
everything is prepared said oehler all i need is 
feedback from this government iraq then everything is settled

judge patricia m wald said monday she will 
step aside as chief judge of the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia circuit to allow judge abner j mikva to take 
the post 
wald 62 said she plans to step down before mikvas 65th 
birthday jan 21 under the law federal judges cannot become 
chief judges of their courts if they have turned 65 
thats the only reason i am doing it i enjoy the job but 
there will be plenty to do just judging said wald who will 
remain an active judge on the court 
the chief judgeship is determined by seniority 
wald said both she and mikva then a democratic congressman from 
illinois were nominated by president carter on the same day in 
1979 
its just the luck of the draw i got confirmed a couple of 
weeks before he did she said 
under ordinary circumstances i would be happy to serve out my 
term said wald who became chief judge in 1986 the law allows 
judges to serve up to seven years as chief judges or until they 
reach age 70 
the dc circuit along with the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals in new york is considered one of the most important 
federal appellate courts in the nation 
because its located in the nations capitll the court reviews 
judicial decisions affecting a wide range of government policies 
it also has original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the 
actions of many federal regulatory agencies such as the federal 
communications commission 
in recent years the court has become at times bitterly divided 
between liberal judges appointed by democratic presidents and a 
growing conservative faction mostly appointed by president reagan 
two judges nominated by president bush a raymond randolph and 
karen l henderson recently took the bench 
wald denied speculation in legal circles that she was stepping 
aside to ensure that laurence h silberman a reagan appointee 
known for his combative demeanor on the bench does not become 
chief judge 
i honestly can tell you i am doing it because of my friendship 
with judge mikva wald said 
nevertheless walds decision to give mikva a chance to serve 
five years as chief judge could prevent silberman 55 from 
becoming chief judge 
mikva could serve five years before being succeeded by judge 
harry edwards now 50 who could serve a full sevenyear term by 
then silberman would be 67

medical researchers accused the food and drug 
administration monday of imperiling their supply of a french 
abortion drug that shows promise in treating cancer and other 
diseases 
scientists are being whiplashed by the fda decision to issue 
an import alert on the french drug ru486 dr george p chrousos 
of the national institute of child health and development in 
bethesda md said at a congressional hearing 
i wont be able to initiate a new study because of the 
uncertain supply of ru486 chrousos said he said the reluctance 
by the french company rousseluclaf to supply it for research in 
this country was unethical 
the fda got carried away under pressure from the 
righttolife movement and may have made a political decision 
chrousos added 
the fda issued an import alert in june 1989 barring the abortion 
drug for personal use after getting inquiries from righttolife 
groups and a dozen members of congress who oppose abortion 
including sen jesse helms rnc and rep robert dornan 
rcalif 
since then some us researchers have had difficulty getting 
the drug from its french manufacturer which fears its business 
could suffer if it becomes embroiled in an abortion controversy 
the regulatory agencys import alert was not a politically 
motivated decision the fdas ronald g chesemore told the house 
subcommittee on regulation business opportunities and energy 
and there was no intention of slowing down the supply of the 
drug for scientific research said chesemore the fdas associate 
commissioner for regulatory affairs 
the drug has shown promise in treating breast and brain cancer 
cushings syndrome and other diseases cushings syndrome is a 
disorder of the pituitary gland 
the fda didnt consult leading us researchers before issuing 
the import alert testified dr kathryn horwitz a professor of 
medicine at the university of colorado 
the fda announced the alert 19 days after demands for it from 
members of congress 
this certainly must be a new landspeed record for an agency 
response to congressional inquiries observed subcommittee 
chairman rep ron wyden dore he called fdas action very 
irresponsible 
wyden suggested that health and human services department 
secretary louis sullivan urge the french company to ensure adequate 
supplies of the drug for us research 
the fda conceded that it issued the alert without evidence that

a rightwing christian militia refused to 
evacuate beirut before a midnight deadline monday despite a 
government warning it would send troops to forceably evict the 
fighters 
the 5 pm est deadline passed with samirs geageas lebanese 
forces the main christian militia holding out in the east beirut 
districts they control the militia served notice they would not 
withdraw unless the government curbs violations by geageas 
prosyrian rivals 
the 6000strong lebanese forces and its allied phalange party 
also demanded the expulsion from christian east beirut of rival 
militiamen under syrianbacked maronite catholic warlord elie 
hobeika 
lebanese president elias hrawi rushed to damascus to discuss 
with syrian president hafez assad whether to use force or further 
diplomacy to make geagea leave east beirut 
geageas intransigence was the first major hitch in the 
implementation of hrawis plan to create a militiafree capital as 
he tries to end lebanons 15year civil war which has left 150000 
people dead 
the largest shiite moslem militias the proiranian hezbollah 
and the prosyrian amal have already agreed to withdraw from 
beirut 
hobeika and his estimated 1500 militiamen returned to parts of 
christian east beirut and the adjoining metn mountains after 
hrawis troops and the syrian army dislodged rebel gen michel aoun 
from the area last month 
aoun had been holed up in the presidential palace for more than 
a year blocking hrawis efforts to end the militia war and 
establish an syriabrokered peace place for lebanon 
geagea who deposed hobeika in a 1986 power struggle claims 
supporters of his archrival have kidnapped scores of his partisans 
and occupied and looted phalangist offices in metn province 
the lebanese broadcasting corporation a televison station 
geagea controls said hobeikas gunmen had kidnapped beaten and 
tortured at least 30 civilian supporters of the lebanese forces 
the station aired a report showing a man identified as youssef 
habshi his back lacerated by whip lashes moaning in pain in a 
hospital bed it said he had been held captive by hobeikas men for 
a week 
do they want us to spread this brutality to the rest of east 
beirut geagea said

bank examiners investigating a possible 
13 million embezzlement at a bank closed by the state studied the 
institutions murky records monday while police searched for its 
missing president 
a handful of angry depositors showed up at the heritage loan and 
investment co demanding their money but were turned away by state 
police dozens more called seeking reassurance their money was 
safe 
the state obtained a judges order putting the twooffice bank 
into receivership sunday after a fourday run drained 136 million 
of its 224 million in deposits and weakened a private bank 
insurance system 
police did not know the whereabouts of joseph mollicone jr 
heritages president and controlling stockholder although our 
information is that hes still very healthy state police maj 
elwood m johnson said 
he would not comment further because of a grand jury 
investigation 
mollicone of providence disappeared nov 8 four days before 
the rhode island share and deposit indemnity corp disclosed that 
heritages records were in disarray the indemnity corporation is a 
25 million fund that covers many credit unions and smaller banks 
wjartv reported last week that mollicone last was seen taking a 
flight to new jersey 
it appears to us to be an embezzlement said peter a 
nevola president and chief executive of the indemnity corporation 
which took control of the bank oct 18 
almost 20 examiners and bank employees tried to reconstruct 
paperwork on loans that nevola said apparently were made in the 
names of depositors without their knowledge 
state regulators in a superior court affidavit seeking the 
receivership estimated the loss at 13 million but nevola said it 
could be higher 
it appears the loans were created to plug a hole in the banks 
assets to meet liabilities nevola said 
mollicone apparently served as a oneman loan committee for the 
bank with few controls 
regardless of what may have been required one individual 
disbursed the credit nevola said though he stopped short of 
saying mollicone took the money 
notices in the banks windows told customers of the cloing 
my companys money is in here said an angry woman who 
identified herself as a real estate broker i need it now not 
tomorrow they shouldnt freeze it its wrong its my money not 
the states 
robert goldberg a department of business regulation lawyer 
answered a telephone at the bank for anxious depositors by midday 
he had told about 50 callers only that the bank would reopen in a 
few days and that their money was insured up to 500000 by the 
indemnity corporation 
as soon as the bank opens i expect all these people will be 
in to withdraw their money he said the last thing we want to 
tell them is that it will be three days and then have them banging 
down the door if it cant open in three days 
goldberg said there were a few abusive callers but most were 
just concerned 
a lot of people have said they have their life savings in the 
bank it ranges from a woman with 50 in a christmas club to one 
with 100000 from the sale of a house frankly the woman with 
100000 seemed less concerned than some of the others with 100 
goldberg said 
risdic insures 16 billion in deposits at 35 credit unions and 
10 banks in rhode island 
some of the credit unions have applied to join the federal 
insurance program 
in a similar case in 1985 the ohio deposit guarantee fund 
collapsed after the failure of the muchlarger home state savings 
bank 
nevola said the rhode island agency was different because its 
members are obligated to replenish the fund and so far had been 
assessed an additional 55 million to do so no other member 
institutions had reported large amounts of withdrawals he said

the un general assembly took up a 
resolution monday demanding that burma free all political prisoners 
and challenging its military rulers to hand over power to the 
opposition 
in the past the assembly has been reluctant to delve into the 
internal affairs of a member state however many foreign countries 
have shown revulsion for the burmese militarys brutal suppression 
of the countrys prodemocracy movement 
sweden introduced the draft resolution in the assemblys 
socalled third committee which deals with human rights free 
elections and other social and humanitarian issues the committee 
will vote on it nov 28 and the entire general assembly will do so 
around dec 18 
twenty countries cosponsored the resolution the 12 european 
community nations along with australia canada austria norway 
iceland poland sweden and hungary 
general assembly resolutions have no binding effect but they 
are a powerful expression of the international communitys will 
the draft resolution expresses concern over the failure of 
burmas military rulers to obey the will of the people by 
turning over power to the opposition 
though the opposition won popular elections in may by a 
landslide the military rulers of the southeast asian country have 
refused to step down they say a new constitution must be drafted 
first a lengthy process 
the un assemblys draft resolution also stresses its 
conviction that all citizens detained with respect to their 
political activities ought to be released immediately and restored 
to the full enjoyment to their right to participate in the 
government of their country 
amnesty international on monday said maung ko a senior burmese 
opposition leader had been found hanged in his cell nov 9 the52 
yearold leader had been detained for two weeks the rights group 
said 
burmas government said he committed suicide but amnesty said 
the mans family believes he was tortured to death because his body 
was covered with bruises and one leg was broken 
many opposition members are imprisoned or detained the leader 
of the opposition aung san suu kyi is under house arrest 
amnesty says many hundreds perhaps thousands of suspected 
government opponents have been detained without trial or sentenced 
to prison terms by unfair military tribunals 
at least 100 people have been sentenced to death although it is 
not known if any sentences have been carried out amnesty said 
in 1988 burma was swept by prodemocracy protests the military 
government cracked down and hundreds of people were killed

the government has questioned former 
ministers of deposed prime minister benazir bhuttos government 
about the 1988 plane crash that killed military ruler mohammed zia 
ulhaq police said monday 
no one has ever been officially blamed for the aug 17 1988 
crash of the c130 transport plane that killed zia about a dozen 
of the countrys topranking military officers and us ambassador 
arnold raphel 
an inquiry by the pakistan and us military concluded it was 
an act of sophisticated technical sabotage 
when ms bhutto came into power in december 1988 further 
investigation was put on hold although zias son ijaz ulhaq 
demanded a reopening of the inquiry 
some of ms bhuttos opponents suggested terrorists allegedly 
led by her brother murtaza had been involved in the crash her 
brother had been in exile in syria 
police officials said investigators are looking into whether 
alzulfikar a terror group named after their late father prime 
minister zulfikar ali bhutto was involved in the crash the elder 
bhutto was overthrown by zia in 1977 and hanged two years later 
murtaza and ms bhutto deny any connection with alzulfikar 
farooq azam a former deputy minister for railways in the bhutto 
government and a former minister for prisons in punjab province 
riaz hussain pirzada are being questioned in the current 
investigation said a senior official of the federal investigation 
agency 
ms bhuttos government was dismissed by the president aug 6 
charging massive corruption and abuse of power and replaced by a 
caretaker government her party was soundly defeated in elections 
last month

president bush may have used the word 
downturn to describe the economy last week but his chief 
economics adviser said monday that it was still too early to tell 
whether the country is in a recession 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said there were substantial risks to the economy if 
oil prices stay at current high levels or rise even further 
he described current conditions as very sluggish but he said it 
would be premature to declare a recession 
i think that regardless of what one calls it clearly the 
economy at best is in sort of a lull with very little growth if 
any boskin said in response to a question during an appearance 
before the national press club 
boskin said the oil shock could be expected to shave about one 
percentage point off growth and boost inflation by 15 to 2 
percentage points 
in the third quarter economic growth as measured by the gross 
national product was rising at a weak annual rate of 18 percent 
by the traditional rule of thumb a recession is defined as two 
consecutive quarters of negative gnp growth 
it is too early to tell whether the united states will have a 
negative fourth quarter or whether we will enter a recession 
boskin said we will just have to wait for the data for another 
couple of months to get a better feel for how the economy is 
doing 
many private economists however contend that the country has 
slipped into a recession and that government statistics will 
confirm that fact in coming months 
last thursday bush conceded for the first time that the country 
may be facing a recession saying i am concerned that were in a 
downturn here 
bush held four private meetings last week with his economic 
advisers and outside business leaders seeking ways to dampen the 
impact of the economic slowdown 
administration officials said the outside business leaders 
expressed the general view that the country has tipped into its 
first recession since the severe 198182 slump 
officials said it will be at least another month before any 
decisions are made on what programs bush will recommend including 
in his 1992 budget proposal to stimulate economic growth boskin 
gave no hint in his appearance monday about what the administration 
is considering

a retired railroad employee who was exposed 
to coal dust at work is entitled to black lung benefits a federal 
appeals court ruled monday 
attorneys for both sides said the ruling marks the first time a 
railroad worker has been awarded black lung benefits which usually 
are paid to coal miners with lung disease 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld findings by an 
administrative law judge and the benefits review board that olen r 
roberson deserved the benefits that usually are paid to coal miners 
with lung disease 
our holding is necessarily narrow in the ordinary case a 
railroad employee engaged in the transportation of coal may well 
not qualify for benefits said the opinion written by judge h 
emory widener jr and joined by judge j dickson phillips jr 
lawrence l moise iii who represented roberson in the case 
against norfolk amp western railway co said the ruling sets a 
precedent for other railroad workers seeking black lung benefits 
the railroad employees have been filing for federal black lung 
benefitsfor years now and its been a disputed issue as to whether 
they qualified he said everyone was waiting to see what was 
going to happen on this particular case 
but moise added that the ruling may not help many workers 
unfortunately a lot of railroad workers that worked in the 
coalfields will get the wrong impression from this decision he 
said it is a very narrow decision 
the ruling may help railroad employees who worked around raw 
coal but not those who transported coal after it was washed at a 
preparation plant moise said 
clinton s morse an attorney for the railroad agreed that the 
case set a precedent he was not sure whether the ruling would be 
appealed to the us supreme court or how many other nampw workers 
could be eligible for benefits 
roberson is totally disabled from pneumoconiosis a lung disease 
that can be caused by inhaling coal dust he applied for black lung 
benefits in 1978 a year before he retired from a 32year career 
with the railroad 
for 14 years roberson spent a large amount of his workday at 
coal mines and around railroad cars that carried raw coal from the 
mines to a preparation plant 
his duties included coupling and uncoupling high pressure air 
hoses between the cars which blew coal dust into the air the 
opinion said 
although roberson never participated in the actual loading or 
unloading of coal he was continually exposed to large amounts of 
coal dust the court said 
the court disagreed with nampws contention that riding on a 
railroad car does not meet the requirement that those who get black 
lung benefits have worked in or around a mine

a soviet soldier ran amok with an armored vehicle 
in berlin after his girlfriend at home jilted him police said and 
he led authorities on a wild chase of rammed cars and smashed 
barricades for hours monday 
his armored personnel carrier roared down the kurfuerstendamm 
the fanciest boulevard in the onceforbidden zone of west berlin 
at 5 am 
what would have been a dangerous international incident during 
the cold war was only a cop chase in todays relaxed eastwest 
atmosphere no one was hurt 
german police and soviet military officials pursued the soldier 
identified only as a 20yearold sergeant from the ukrainian city 
of kharkov for block after block as dawn broke 
he was finally arrested near suburban potsdam about 7 am after 
a red army sergeant leaped on the renegade tracked vehicle and 
slammed shut the drivers vision slit ending a journey of at least 
40 miles 
police later said the soldier had received a letter from his 
girlfriend that broke his heart he showed no signs of mental 
illness or drunkenness police said 
the sergeants predawn odyssey began at a red army base in 
elstal a small town four miles west of the berlin city limits on 
former east german territory 
driving without lights he sped southwest toward potsdam where 
german police first saw the vehicle soviet military patrols had 
earlier spotted the wayward driver 
his vehicle smashed a truck blocking the street and reached the 
highway leading to the center of what was west berlin until unity 
six weeks ago 
the berlin wall prevented such escapades until nov 9 1989 
even after the concrete barricade fell soviet soldiers were 
forbidden to travel to west berlin without special permission 
the ride took the soldier down the kurfuerstendamm the 
treelined boulevard lit by twinkling christmas lights past the 
luxury kadewe department store and other elegant shops 
the straying soldier rammed a german police car before crossing 
into what was east berlin there he headed down leipziger strasse 
a major avenue not far from where checkpoint charlie once stood a 
resident complained of loud motor noises as the determined driver 
headed east and then south toward potsdam 
a soviet truck that had been following the entire time finally 
overtook the speeding vehicle and a soviet sergeant jumped on and 
shut the vision slit 
the soldier was taken into custody for questioning 
senior german government officials have expressed concern about 
the estimated 360000 soviet soldiers still stationed on former 
east german territory many of whom live on bases in the forests 
around berlin 
the red army has far fewer military duties now that former enemy 
west germany has incorporated warsaw pactdropout east germany 
complete withdrawal of former frontline force against nato is not 
scheduled until 1994 
mondays jaunt is the most spectacular reported misuse of soviet 
army equipment 
police have seized caches of weapons being sold by soldiers 
reports say soldiers at a training base outside berlin will take 
civilians for a tank ride for 100 marks 68 
visits are still rare and soviet soldiers are not encouraged to 
spend time outside the barracks 
some red army troops are determined to stay in the wealthy west 
officially 53 soviet soldiers have asked for asylum in germany 
but the number is believed to be higher since it takes weeks and 
sometimes months to register cases

the countrys two most populous republics signed 
their own trade pact monday while a new secessionist movement 
emerged in russia in the latest signs of soviet fragmentation news 
reports said 
russian republic president boris n yeltsin and ukrainian 
president leonid kravchuk signed a 10year agreement monday 
recognizing each others autonomy from the kremlin they also 
promised to develop direct ukrainianrussian ties in fields ranging 
from politics to science and technology 
yeltsin reiterated that the new union treaty proposed by 
president mikhail s gorbachev to create a new federation of the 15 
republics must be a voluntary agreement by autonomous states 
we cannot wait for a treaty and idle away the time everyone 
is waiting for some impulse i believe the agreement between the 
two equal sovereign states is such an impulse yeltsin told 
reporters according to the official news agency tass 
russia and the ukraine together comprise 200 million of the 
countrys 285 million people the ukraine is the countrys 
traditional breadbasket while russia possess the bulk of the 
soviet unions raw material on twothirds of the nations 
territory 
yeltsin also challenged gorbachevs statement last week that 
republics should be wary of letting russia gain too much power 
we resolutely denounce the statement that russia is claiming 
for itself a key role and that the center is shifting to russia on 
the contrary we have shown our desire to build relations on an 
equality basis he said 
meanwhile in the southwestern corner of the russian republic 
the karachayevocherkess autonomous region declared itself a 
republic within russia according to the independent postfactum 
news agency 
the region about 225 miles northwest of tbilisi has about 
370000 people the karachay the largest group are a 
turkicspeaking people but postfactum did not say what their 
complaints are 
the region will continue to abide by russian republic laws until 
its main ethnic groups karachays cherkess abazin and nogay 
create a federation of four smaller republics postfactum said

leaders of 34 nations toasted the end of cold war 
rivalries monday in a celebration tarnished by distant military 
rumbles from the middle east president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev grappled for a common strategy on the possible 
use of force to oust iraq from kuwait 
in capping a longawaited eastwest agreement to reduce forces 
and troop levels in europe bush said the treaties and testimonials 
of paris would be undermined if the rule of law is shamelessly 
disregarded elsewhere 
he met over dinner with gorbachev who has been preaching 
patience while the white house has been working to gather support 
for a new united nations resolution that would endorse the use of 
force is sanctions fail to dislodge iraq from kuwait 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush and gorbachev 
had a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out 
however gorbachev has been emphasizing the search for a 
peaceful solution 
i think we all need patience but that does not mean that we 
are going to weaken or retreat from earlier un resolutions 
calling for an unconditional iraqi withdrawal gorbachev said at a 
picturetaking session before dinner 
behind the scenes bush sought support from those attending the 
european summit for a proposed un resolution authorizing military 
force to drive iraq from kuwait 
it is time to discuss this matter further in the united 
nations security council fitzwater said we continue 
consultations with our friends and allies on this issue and we will 
continue to work with them in the security council framework 
reacting to reports that iraq was nearly doubling its forces in 
occupied kuwait fitzwater said it was another instance of him 
saddam thumbing his nose at the united nations he sought to 
minimize differences between the two leaders on the issue of force 
saying they both favored a peaceful solution to this crisis 
a proposed joint news conference by the two superpower leaders 
was cancelled fitzwater said the cancellation did not reflect a 
new snag but said that it was late in the day and both leaders 
decided against it 
they both simply felt it had been a long day fitzwater 
said 
we are united on this issue fitzwater told reporters in a 
joint briefing with gorbachevs new spokesman vitaly ignatenko 
we have a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out 
ignatenko said that additional iraqi troops in kuwait gave the 
gulf situation a dangerous character 
we once again stated and it was underlined that it is 
necessary to curtail aggression and everything needs to return to 
the condition that existed before the aggression against and the 
annexation of kuwait 
both sides once again agreed that it was necessary to return 
to the security council to once again discuss thoroughly this 
problem the soviet spokesman said 
fitzwater said the leaders discussed the circumstances that 
might prompt a military offensive against iraq but added we 
simply have not reached the point of decision yet 
earlier in the ornate french presidential residence the elysee 
palace leaders of 16 nato members and the remaining six warsaw 
pact nations signed two treaties one making sweeping cuts in 
nonnuclear arms throughout europe and the other pledging 
nonaggression toward one another 
then the 22 representatives of the two military alliances 
joined leaders of neutral and unaligned countries to begin an 
unprecedented 34nation summit on the future of europe what a 
long way the world has come gorbachev declared 
a mark of just how far the world had come is the alliance 
between bush and gorbachev against iraq 
even as the leaders met to discuss peace in europe iraqi 
president saddam hussein indicated that he would send an additional 
250000 troops to kuwait nearly doubling the occupation force in 
the oilrich emirate the buildup announced by the iraqi news 
agency apparently was in response to bushs decision to augment 
the 230000 us forces now in the persian gulf region by another 
200000 military personnel 
fitzwater said the new iraqi deployment was another instance 
of him saddam thumbing his nose at the united nations 
both bush and gorbachev renewed appeals for iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait 
bush sought to deflect questions over differences with 
gorbachev he told reporters before the dinner im very pleased 
with the way the soviet union and the united states can work 
together in the united nations there continues to be very 
openminded communications and i have no reason to be anything 
other than very satisfied 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker reportedly was 
considering a trip later this week to yemen and beyond yemen is 
the only arab nation on the un security council and has in the 
past shown sympathy for iraq it will assume the councils rotating 
presidency in december 
baker already was scheduled to go next weekend to colombia to 
confer with president cesar gaviria last weekend baker met with 
the foreign ministers of eight members of the 15nation council 
the crisis in the middle east sounded a distant discordant 
drumbeat as leaders of nearly all nations in europe and north 
america saluted the democratic changes that have swept through 
europe in recent years 
french president francois mitterrand formally opened the 
34nation conference on security and cooperation in europe our 
meeting today marks the end of an epoch and thereby a beginning 
he declared it is the first time in history that we witness a 
change in depth of our landscape which is not the outcome of a war 
or bloody revolution 
the centerpiece of the summit the conventional armed forces in 
europe cfe treaty calls for the destruction or removal of 
thousands of tanks artillery pieces combat vehicles and attack 
aircraft from the atlantic to the ural mountains deep inside the 
soviet union 
by so doing it will alter the military balance in europe by 
erasing moscows ability to mass huge numbers of tanks and other 
heavy armor in central europe 
the other treaty is a nonaggression pact in which the 
members of the two alliances declare they are no longer 
adversaries and will refrain from the threat or use of force 
against each other 
bush called the cfe treaty the farthestreaching arms 
agreement in history and it signals the new world order that is 
emerging 
yet he cautioned our success here can be neither profound nor 
enduring if the rule of law is shamelessly disregarded elsewhere 
french authorities imposed tight security around the 
unprecedented summit sharpshooters were placed on rooftops 
antiterrorist units were mobilized and 10000 police officers 
fanned out throughout the city 
with each of the 34 government leaders having separate 
motorcades traffic was frequently snarled 
bush is seeking backing for a united nations resolution 
authorizing military action to force iraq out of kuwait he told 
the leaders that principles of peace and self determination being 
enshrined in paris are grossly violated in the persian gulf 
one allied leader he didnt ave to persuade was british prime 
minister margaret thatcher after a breakfast meeting with bush 
mrs thatcher reiterated her willingness to use force to pry saddam 
from kuwait 
most people understand that evil has to be stopped either he 
withdraws or the military option has to be used she said on the 
eve of a conservative party challenge to her continued leadership

sen dennis deconcini directed a fiery attack 
monday at the ethics committees special counsel accusing him of 
relying on lies and allegations and hearsay to build a case 
that the arizona democrat improperly assisted former savings and 
loan operator charles h keating jr 
deconcini abandoned his normally lowkey style and often raised 
his voice to a shout as he denied wrongdoing and defiantly said of 
lawyer robert s bennett he stands here as a prosecutor he 
wants a victory he wants to nail somebody 
bennett wants another trophy on the wall said deconcini he 
was the last senator to give his opening statement in the ethics 
committee hearings into allegations that the keating five 
intervened for the businessman because of the 13 million he 
contributed to their campaigns and causes 
sens alan cranston dcalif john mccain rariz john glenn 
dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich all denied impropriety 
often emotionally on friday 
the issue in this case is not me bennett retorted when 
given a chance to speak later in the day the issue in this case 
is the conduct of the senators that is what has brought them 
here 
the lawyer also ridiculed suggestions by cranston deconcini and 
riegle that he was holding them to nonexistant senate standards of 
conduct 
the greatest deliberative body in the whole world you cant 
hack it under my standards these are not my standards bennett 
said these are your standards 
he also said the experienced defense lawyers in the case know 
that when you dont like the law you go after the opposing 
lawyer when you dont like the message you burn the messenger 
the third day of hearings ended after bennett called his first 
witness mccain staffer gwendolyn van paasschen she backed 
mccains testimony that he refused to negotiate with regulators for 
keating prompting keating to call the senator a wimp 
the ethics committee three democratic and three republican 
senate colleagues of the five lawmakers being investigated could 
recommend that the full senate approve punishment such as 
reprimands or it could recommend at the end of the hearings that 
no action be taken against some or all of the five 
keating was the chairman of the failed lincoln savings and loan 
of irvine calif and made many of his contributions while trying 
unsuccessfully to keep the government from seizing his thrift the 
sampls parent company is based in arizona deconcini and mccains 
home state 
lincolns collapse is expected eventually to cost taxpayers 2 
billion 
deconcini said he intervened for keating with banking regulators 
in april 1987 because he believed the businessman had a 
legitimate beef with the federal government constituents he 
said have a right to ask for your intervention because 
bureaucrats often are wrong and somebody ought to stand up 
for them 
ive never been bought deconcini said adding that 
bennetts evidence presented last week contains hearsay 
contains rumors unfounded allegations about all of the senators 
information has been left out and distorted i hope you find 
in your conscience theres something grossly unfair what is wrong 
with intervention for someone who contributes to your campaign 
nothing 
last week bennett suggested that deconcini and cranston were 
most deeply involved with keating 
evidence shows deconcini was asked repeatedly to perform 
services for charles keating and that senator deconcini almost 
always honored mr keatings request bennett said 
deconcini also contended that bennett was giving the only 
republican among the five mccain preferential treatment 
he said bennett had failed to ask mccain about his wifes 
investment in a shopping center with keating and to press him on 
vacation trips mccain and his family took on keatings airplanes 
bennett mentioned both last week but dismissed them as without 
serious consequence to the case 
bennett in unreleased but widely reported recommendations has 
proposed that mccain and glenn be dropped from the investigation 
while the probe be intenstified for the other three 
mccain has said his wifes investments were separate from his 
he also belatedly paid for trips on keatings plane and notified 
the ethics committee of his action no action was taken by the 
panel 
deconcini also said that federal regulators waited for two years 
to criticize the senators intervention and that they complained 
only after the savings and loan crisis was coming down on their 
heads they had a conscience problem because of their failure to 
properly regulate failing thrifts the senator contended 
he invoked the name of mother teresa to indicate that when he 
intervened for keating the thrift operator had a stellar reputation 
as the largest home builder in arizona 
deconcini said when he met mother teresa the nobel prize winner 
for her work for the poor the first thing she asked was how is 
my friend charlie keating the senator said keating was a 
different person than he is perceived today 
the senator said he never negotiated for keating with banking 
regulators 
i wanted responsiveness from the regulators i wanted some 
answers he said the special counsel says i was negotiating 
theres no rule that says you cant negotiate but i wasnt 
negotiating merely trying to get the government to respond 
to a legitimate complaint of a constituent 
he complained that he was being forced to counter derogatory 
information lies and allegations and hearsay that mr bennett goes 
out and gets people to give 
he said that common cause the private group that brought the 
initial complaint that triggered the probe did so as a 
fundraising tool 
ms van paasschen testified that she and mccain thought 
deconcini had agreed to limit the agenda at a crucial meeting 
between four senators and the top thrift regulator edwin j gray 
on april 2 1987 
the testimony is important because deconcini denied there was 
any such limitation bennett said the evidence shows that deconcini 
went beyond any such agreement and offered a deal on keatings 
behalf to gray 
deconcini mccain and the two other senators present denied that 
any quid pro quo for gray was offered

a longhidden cache of personal letters 
unveiled monday should give historians new insight into one of the 
leaders of the famed lewis and clark expedition that explored the 
northern plains and the northwest 
the 47 letters from capt william clark five of them written 
during the 18031806 expedition into the newly acquired louisiana 
territory are a tremendous find said james r bentley 
executive director of the filson club the louisville historical 
repository that now owns the letters 
among the more important illuminations are clarks thoughts on 
the mysterious death in 1809 of expedition commander meriwether 
lewis and his opinion of the treacherous aaron burr vice president 
under thomas jefferson whose 15 million louisiana purchase 
doubled the nations size 
the letters dated from 1792 to 1811 are addressed to gen 
jonathan clark the explorers older brother until two years ago 
the letters were hidden away in the louisville attic of clarks 
descendants 
some historians have argued that lewis then governor of the 
territory he helped explore and map was murdered on his way to 
washington dc but clarks letters support the theory that his 
friend killed himself 
clark clearly indicates in his letters that he believed lewis 
was in an unstable state of mind and was very capable of committing 
suicide said james j holmberg curator of manuscripts for the 
filson club 
in one letter clark calls lewis a poor fellow who was 
much distressed about how the public might perceive his 
handling of financial matters in the territory 
holmberg said that in another letter clark tells how lewis had 
asked him and others to help sell his property and settle his debts 
shortly before his death 
references to burr perhaps best known for killing treasury 
secretary alexander hamilton in a duel turn up frequently in the 
correspondence 
the references focus on burrs alleged attempts to raise an army 
and overthrow the government in his letters clark refers to burr 
as a second napoleon holmberg said 
he told president jefferson that burr was a real danger and 
that something needs to be done about him holmberg said and 
something was he was arrested 
the letters will force revision of several biographies holmberg 
said including that of clarks slave york who accompanied the 
group on the excursion 
holmberg said a 1985 book about york in search of york by 
robert betts was extremely thorough but he said new information 
in the letters explains some important events in yorks life such 
as how clarks refusal to reunite york with his slave wife caused 
an irreparable rift between the two men 
the clark descendants just recently completed the legal process 
of turning the documents over to the filson club which now owns 
six of the 12 existing letters clark wrote during the expedition 
the six others are scattered in other collections the filson club 
would not disclose what it paid for the letters 
winifred george of st louis incoming president of the 
1500member montanabased lewis and clark trail heritage 
foundation said it was a wonderful find 
its been some years since something new has been 
discovered george said we often forget how important that 
expedition was to the entire westward development she said 
bentley acknowledged that the documents wont exactly rewrite 
the history books but said they offer illuminating details 
what struck me most was the insight on william clark it 
shows a side of him that would hard to find otherwise he said

peace talks between the angolan 
government and usbacked unita rebels were deadlocked monday and 
a rebel negotiator broke a gag rule to criticize the governments 
position 
whats happened so far is unhappily very little almost 
nothing because of the manifest lack of political will on one 
side rebel spokesman norberto de castro said 
the situation is not bright said a portuguese foreign 
ministry official but things are not as bad as has been said 
portugal is mediating the talks aimed at ending a 15year civil 
war that by government count has taken 340000 lives delegations 
from the united states and the soviet union which arm the opposing 
sides are atending the talks as observers 
both sides had agreed not to comment on the talks while they 
were in progress but de castro said portuguese news media had 
unfairly blamed the rebels for the deadlock in the talks which 
began friday in estoril a coastal resort 16 miles west of lisbon 
the negotiations appeared to be stalled over the timing of the 
merging of the two armies and the governments recognition of unita 
as a legitimate political force 
the angolan government proposes the integration of the two 
armies before multiparty elections unita wants elections first 
the government is also reluctant to recognize unita until a 
ceasefire is signed 
unita the portuguese initials of the national union for the 
total independence of angola and the governing popular movement 
for the liberation of angola or mpla were rival factions in the 
independence struggle against portugal 
when portugal granted angola independence in 1975 the mpla 
entered triumphantly into luanda unita continued to fight them

a study has demonstrated that lean beef can be 
safely substituted for poultry or fish in a lowcholesterol diet 
but the nutritionist who did the study cautioned that doesnt mean 
burgers and chickenfried steak 
lynne scott assistant professor at the baylor college of 
medicine in houston said her study of 46 men with borderline high 
cholesterol found that lean beef can be as effective as lean 
chicken or fish in a lowcholesterol diet 
theres no reason that they couldnt eat beef as long as they 
stipulate it is a very lean beef in a lowfat diet ms scott 
said it must be with that stipulation however otherwise 
immediately people start thinking of hamburgers lasagna and 
chickenfried steak and thats not what were talking about 
the study findings will be published in the january edition of 
nutrition metabolism and cardiovascular disease journal ms scott 
said last week she presented her findings in an abstract at the 
american heart associations 63rd annual convention in dallas 
ms scott put the 46 men whose cholesterol levels were between 
200 and 250 milligrams per deciliter of blood on the lowfat 
lowcholesterol diet recommended by the american heart association 
that diet has less than 30 percent of calories derived from fat and 
less than 10 percent from saturated fat 
half of the group ate 8 ounces of beef daily with less than 4 
percent fat while the other half ate 4 ounces of red snapper and 4 
ounces of skinless chicken breast 
after four weeks the overall cholesterol levels of both groups 
declined by the same amount and there was no statistically 
significant difference in their cholesterol levels 
ms scott said the finding supports allowing more variety in 
such diets but she emphasized the beef had to be extra lean and 
cooked without additional fats 
it was all steaks strip steaks with the fat trimmed 
away she said its not hamburger that isnt graded in the 
same way that whole meat is 
she said the study showed if a person is going to use beef he 
should use the select grade and he needs to trim off all of the 
fat 
the findings did not surprise dr robert lees professor of 
cardiovascular disease at the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
its kind of an old finding really he said i think 
there has been a lot of emotion involved in each new dietary 
finding and people lose track of exactly what they are talking 
about 
certainly lean beef if its truly lean is probably not very 
different in terms of its metabolic effect than poultry which has 
more fat than people realize lees said 
dr louis rakita professor of medicine at case western reserve 
university in cleveland said that while the studys results are 
valid he questioned whether the public would eat the same amount 
of meat as did the study subjects 
there is nothing inappropriate about the result of that study 
the question is can people eat a small enough amount of meat 
said rakita a member of the american heart associations task 
force on cholesterol 
under the strict control of her experiment i think the 
results are understandable he said i think her 
recommendations are appropriate provided you can stick to the 
standards of her experiment 
ms scott now is researching the effects on subjects with high 
cholesterol to see if the source of the fat makes a difference 
the second study is expected to be completed sometime next year

prime minister yitzhak shamir defending a 
speech that stirred anger in israel and abroad denied monday he 
had meant to say the occupied lands should be kept to house soviet 
immigrants 
shamir made the controversial speech sunday night at a memorial 
service for dead politicians from his rightwing likud bloc he 
said the party leaders left us a clear message to keep the land 
of israel from the sea to the jordan river for future generations 
and for the mass immigration and for the jewish people most of 
whom will be gathered into this country 
egypt on monday accused shamir of expansionist intentions 
israeli legislators from the left accused shamir of jeopardizing 
immigration by suggesting he wants to settle soviet jews in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
on monday shamir said he had been defining two of his dreams 
he said there was no linkage between his wish for a greater 
israel and the question of soviet immigration 
my message was first the land of israel from the sea to the 
river and second a massive jewish immigration from all parts of 
the world in order to concentrate all the jewish people or the 
majority of the jewish people in israel shamir said on israel 
television 
at least 120000 soviet jews have arrived so far this year and 
1 million are expected by the end of 1992 
in january shamir created another political storm by telling a 
party gathering that for a large immigration we need the land of 
israel a large and strong israel we will need a lot of place to 
absorb everybody 
palestinian and arab leaders immediately launched a campaign to 
block immigration of thousands of soviet jews the arabs fear the 
immigrants will displace palestinians in the occupied lands 
israel captured the territories in the 1967 middle east war from 
jordan and egypt palestinians have been waging a nearly 3year 
uprising aimed at freeing the land from israeli control 
the united states has repeatedly called for a landforpeace 
settlement in the region it has insisted on israeli guarantees 
that usbacked loans for the soviet immigrants not be used in the 
occupied lands or arab east jerusalem 
in cairo egyptian foreign minister ismat abdelmeguid on monday 
summoned israels ambassador to explain shamirs remark his 
ministry issued a statement saying egypt rejects in its totality 
shamirs comments which indicate his expansionist intention to 
occupy territories belonging to someone else and this cannot help 
reach a peaceful settlement to the palestinian issue 
speaking in the israeli parliament yair tzaban head of the 
socialist mapam party asked shamir why he couldnt keep his 
thoughts to himself 
why cant you restrain your ideological thoughts where will 
your tongue take us he asked 
chaim ramon head of the leftofcenter labor party faction in 
parliament criticized shamirs comment on israel radio i am 
calling on the prime minister to be quiet for heavens sake he is 
risking the chances of immigration

now that atlanta has the 1996 summer games in the 
bag a local mens club has launched a tongueincheek campaign to 
promote the city as host for the 1998 winter olympics 
the atlanta millionaires club has suggested activities including 
slalom tractor pulls snowmobile demolition derbies and contests to 
determine who is most guiltfree about taking off from work because 
of a few snow flurries 
the temperature didnt stop us from getting the summer 
olympics lawyer tully hazell chairman of the winter events 
committee said monday we cant think small here 
billy payne who put together atlantas winning proposal to be 
host for the 1996 summer games will serve as honorary chairman for 
the groups unofficial kickoff for the 1998 bid dec 1 
donations collected during the kickoff will go to the howard 
schools which help those with learning disabilities in atlanta 
hazell said the club would not let atlantas winter temperatures 
with average highs in the 60s be a deterrent to the olympic quest 
once we put our climate issue behind us i think atlanta has a 
lot of things to offer as the site of the winter games hazell 
said first of all its generally pretty warm here in february 
so you probably wont have to get all bundled up when you go out to 
watch the events 
backup plans call for tobacco spitting and cow tipping contests 
payne said the atlanta millionaires club has about 50 members 
we have a very select but diverse membership he said the 
way i would describe it is if you were at your wifes or 
girlfriends christmas parties we would be the guys that would be 
standing around the bar

government and university of wisconsin 
reseachers have developed the worlds first hightemperature 
superconducting transistor a device some hope will improve future 
generations of electronic equipment 
while superconductive compounds that function at the relatively 
warm temperatures of liquid nitrogen have been developed in the 
past few years this new device is the first to use those materials 
to create a transistor 
the superconducting flux flow transistor was developed at the 
university of wisconsin and sandia national laboratories in 
albuquerque nm at the direction of jon martens a uwmadison 
graduate and electrical engineering professors james e nordman 
and james b beyer 
the department of energy backed the project 
we have taken the device and coupled it with passive microwave 
components to make real circuits that have exciting potential 
said dr david ginley supervisor of semiconductor research at 
sandia 
transistors function as switches that control electrical 
current they also are used to amplify signals from devices ranging 
from stereos to communication satellites some early ones were the 
size of coins but others are so small a computer chip may contain 
hundreds 
superconductivity the loss of all resistance to electrical 
currents occurs in certain materials when they are chilled by 
liquid helium to minus 452 degrees fahrenheit a temperature near 
absolute zero 
devices that are superconductive at higher more economical 
temperatures are a key to the electronic industrys quest to make 
faster computers lowernoise microwave components and other 
improved products 
the superconducting transistor is etched in a thin film of 
thalium and copper oxide and operates at a much warmer temperature 
of minus 320 degrees fahrenheit that of liquid nitrogen which is 
considerably less expensive than liquid helium 
the new transistor intrigues scientists partly because it 
functions differently than conventional transistors made of 
materials like silicon and gallium arsenide 
conventional transistors use voltage alterations to control 
electrical current the new transistor uses current changes to 
control the voltage 
ken frazier a spokesman at sandia said the new transistor may 
serve as a bridge between solidstate electronic circuitry that 
functions at room temperatures and future circuitry operating at 
superconductivity temperatures 
but nordman one of the supervising engineers cautioned that 
scientists are still studying the devices properties and are far 
from determining its specific application 
the transistor was invented in 1948 and weve been learning 
about it ever since nordman said

a military court sentenced reserve army maj 
ilan hauser to 45 days in jail monday and demoted him to second 
lieutenant for starting a riot in an arab village that left one 
palestinian dead army radio said 
hauser was also given a sixmonth suspended sentence the radio 
said adding he would be allowed to serve his sentence doing work 
on the army base instead of behind bars 
the incident occurred last december when hauser led his company 
of reservists into el janiya in the occupied west bank 11 miles 
northwest of jerusalem following repeated stonings of israeli 
cars 
israel radio said that without authorization hauser gathered 
the villagers in the main square for a discussion and then suddenly 
threw a stun grenade into the crowd a riot broke out during which 
a palestinian farej abu fahida was shot to death 
also monday the civil administration began distributing 
restrictive identity cards to about 2400 west bank palestinians 
who are said to pose a security risk or have a criminal record the 
card permanently bars its holder from visiting or working in 
israel 
issuance of the new cards will bring to 10000 the number arabs 
from the occupied territories who are blocked from israel

arab nations on monday abandoned their 
eightyear drive to oust israel from the united nations but they 
said they do not recognize israeli sovereignty over jerusalem or 
the occupied territories 
the decision followed a change of tactics by the palestine 
liberation organization which wants to attach special conditions 
on a vote expected later this month on israels credentials 
arab un members began the drive to kick out israel in 1982 but 
have suffered increasingly wide defeats in annual votes 
arab nations have repeatedly challenged israels right to sit in 
the general assembly among other peaceloving states when the 
credentials committee presented its report 
the chairman of the arab group for the month lebanese 
ambassador khalil makkawi said the arabs would move that israels 
credentials be accepted so long as the jewish state does not 
represent araboccupied territories 
those areas according to the proposed amendment are 
jerusalem gaza the west bank and golan heights 
israel captured arab east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war and has annexed it israel claims jerusalem as its 
capital and says it will never give the city up 
most countries reject israels annexation of jerusalem 
preferring to push for a 1948 general assembly plan that would have 
made israel an international city and created two countries 
israel and palestine 
israel recognizes the west bank and gaza strip as occupied and 
has expressed willingness to negotiate over some of that land in 
bilateral talks with its neighbors 
normally acceptance of credentials is an automatic technical 
affair if a countrys foreign minister signs a diplomats 
credentials the delegate is accepted 
israels un mission said it rejected any approach to israels 
credentials that singles out the jewish state with any special 
conditions 
the arab approach to the credentials issue is being called the 
portuguese formula after an approach african nations took to 
portugals un membership in 1973 when it still had african 
colonies 
the general assembly voted that year to accept portugals 
credentials on the condition that portugal did not represent its 
african colonies which were then fighting liberation wars against 
lisbon 
the united states britain and other european nations oppose the 
arab approach to the israel situation 
they say that a technical issue such as proper credentials 
should not be converted into a political debate and unsuccessfully 
tried to persuade the arabs to limit themselves to critical 
speeches on the floor of the general assembly 
the united states and other western countries are expected to 
vote against setting special conditions on israel but if they lose 
that vote to vote in favor of accepting the entire credentials 
report covering all delegations 
that is how america and britain voted in 1973 on the portugal 
issue 
several weeks ago the palestine liberation organization 
proposed dropping the challenge to israels credentials and instead 
voting in favor of israel but with conditions 
the plo proposed that israel be accepted on the condition that 
it obey security council resolutions rejecting the jewish states 
annexation of jerusalem 
arab states eventually decided that that approach was too 
legally tangled and opted for the portuguese formula 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir was immersed in a 
furor over remarks he made sunday about the occupied lands he had 
said likud leaders of the past had left us a clear message to 
keep the land of israel from the sea to the jordan river for future 
generations and for the mass immigration and for the jewish people 
most of whom will be gathered into this country 
on monday he denied he meant to say the occupied lands should 
be kept to accommodate soviet immigrants he told israeli 
television my message was first the land of israel from the sea 
to the river and second a massive jewish immigration from all 
parts of the world in order to concentrate all the jewish people 
or the majority of the jewish people in israel 
egypt and leftwing israeli legislators condemned the initial 
remarks

opposition sen juan ponce enrile 
said monday he opposes any new treaty keeping us military bases 
here and that such a treaty would never gain the necessary votes in 
the philippines senate 
in a speech at manilas university of the east enrile said the 
philippines cannot puruse an independent foreign policy if the us 
military facilities remain on its soil 
the united states maintains the giant clark air base subic bay 
naval base and four smaller installations under a 1947 agreement 
that expires in september 1991 
the philippine constitution requires a treaty approved by 
twothirds of the 23member senate to keep the facilities beyond 
1991 manila and washington on nov 9 ended a second round of talks 
on a new treaty 
enrile a former defense secretary said he and 11 other 
senators have signed a resolution opposing any extension of the 
bases stay at least 16 signatures are need to pass any new bases 
treaty enrile said 
we must pursue an independent foreign policy and this we 
cannot attain unless we do away with the military bases 
agreement enrile said 
foreign secretary raul manglapus said recently that manila would 
take over clark and the four facilities but was willing to extend 
us use of the subic facility for five to seven years 
washington has said it wants to retain access and a limited 
troop presence for 10 to 12 years

iraq will send 250000 more troops to 
kuwait giving it a military superiority in the persian gulf 
standoff that others cannot match the official iraqi news 
agency reported monday 
it said president saddam hussein and his military commanders met 
and decided to send seven extra divisions of the regular army and 
an additional 150000 reserves and draftees 
the announcement monitored in cyprus came 11 days after 
president bush announced a us buildup in the gulf to about 
430000 military personnel expected to be completed in january 
no indication emerged as to where the extra regular iraqi troops 
would come from iraqs army totaling 55 divisions of 555000 
regular troops and 480000 reserves already was believed to have 
430000 men in southern iraq and kuwait 
it is worth mentioning that according to military 
considerations the percentage of attacking force to defending 
force is three to one ina said 
this means the united states will need to mobilize a 
3millionstrong force with similar equipment and armament to our 
forces if it is to attack the agency went on 
the superiority will thus remain at its required standard 
which the others cannot match 
iraqs regular army includes seven divisions of the elite 
republican guards totaling about 120000 men these troops formed 
the spearhead of iraqs offensives in the closing stages of the 
198088 iraniraq war in which iranianheld iraqi territory was 
recaptured they also led the invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
in kuwait iraq already has an estimated 10 divisions three 
armored two mechanized infantry four infantry and one commando 
totaling 170000 troops with about 1500 t55 and t62 tanks 
a further 1516 divisions totaling about 250000 men including 
at least six republican guard divisions with up to 1800 tanks 
including all iraqs t72s and approximately 750 guns are dug in 
in southern iraq south of basra straddling the kuwaiti border 
five more divisions totaling 20000 men are believed to be 
spread along the saudi arabia border many in the sector near 
kuwait 
the multinational force of about 350000 troops in the gulf 
region includes 240000 americans an estimated 170000 ground 
troops 46000 navy personnel and 30000 air force personnel are 
deployed in northeastern saudi arabia around dhahran and the bulk 
of the kingdoms oilfields 
bush announced nov 8 he has ordered more us forces into the 
gulf region and said the planned rotation of troops already 
deployed in saudi arabia has been scrapped 
iraqi officials have claimed the increases expose us 
intentions from the beginning to attack iraq instead of to defend 
saudi arabia as bush said originally 
ina reported earlier monday that iraqi defense minister 
abduljabbar shanshal condemned a statement by defense secretary 
dick cheney that foreign forces in saudi arabia under us 
command are capable to defeat iraqi forces if they want 
such statements involve big risks cheney will discover but 
before it is too late that his wrong calculation and his attempts 
to bluff involved him in an impasse ina said

a chinese physician said monday he will 
seek a us patent for a herbal ointment he claims can greatly 
reduce the pain and healing time of patients with serious burns 
officials at hackensack medical center said they hope to conduct 
clinical trials of dr xu rongxiangs ointment once it is patented 
and they learn whats in it 
other burn experts said they would have to see proof before 
accepting the claims made by xu director of chinas science and 
technology center of burns wounds and surface ulcers 
dr anthony barbara chief of pediatric surgery at hackensack 
medical center said he saw the benefits of xus treatment during a 
visit to china last year 
it does work theres no question about it barbara said 
during a news conference with xu at the hospital how it works 
wed have to find out 
until laboratory animal and human trials are conducted its 
too early to judge whether the ointment represents improvement over 
current treatment said dr fred caldwell of the university of 
arkansas school of medicine president of the american burn 
association 
what we have here are claims but theyre a little short on 
documentation caldwell said in a telephone interview from little 
rock ark 
i think everybody who works in this area has to have an open 
mind for new treatments he said on the other hand i think 
you couldnt be less than really objective in the evaluation weve 
had too many false starts 
his skepticism was echoed by dr francis nance chairman of the 
surgery department and director of the burn unit at st barnabas 
medical center in livingston 
new formulas for topical treatment of burns are a dime a 
dozen they come and go nance said 
xu said he has used the treatment on 54000 patients in china 
where he said the government approved testing in 1988 the 
ointment made from plants is applied directly to burned skin 
our medicine has the property of reducing further injury of 
the burn wound it has the property of combating infection and 
thirdly the medicine can promote or accelerate the healing of 
wounds xu said through an interpreter 
xu is in the united states to meet with burn experts and federal 
health officials and to apply for a patent he said he could not 
describe the contents of his ointment until it is patented and 
neither he nor barbara would speculate how long that might take 
tests would determine how the ointment acts on the skin what 
side effects it might have and what dosage is appropriate barbara 
said it could take seven to 10 years for the food and drug 
administration to approve the ointment for widespread use he 
added 
barbara and harry j gaynor president of the national burn 
victim foundation based in orange traveled to china a year ago and 
met with xu and several of his patients gaynor said they saw 
newlyburned patients who appeared to be in little or no pain and 
former patients showing no signs of scarring despite having 
suffered severe burns 
i strongly feel that each and every day this ointment is not 
available that children and adults are suffering needlessly 
gaynor said 
barbara said the ointment would be particularly useful for 
treating deep seconddegree burns involving blistering and 
damage to the skin below the surface but not complete destruction 
of the tissue 
xu said the ointment shortened treatment time for deep 
seconddegree burns to around 1820 days he and barbara said 
this represents about a onethird reduction in the time it takes 
for such burns to heal but caldwell disagreed 
thats what we expect now caldwell said if a burn wound 
isnt closed in 21 days youd like to close it with a skin

president bush said monday he was prepared to send 
food to the soviet union during the bleak winter to help 
preserve mikhail s gorbachevs democratic reforms 
we want to try to help with the evolution of market systems 
and the evolution of the change thats taking place bush said 
before a twohour meeting with gorbachev and you also want to 
help new friends when you find them if theyre in jeopardy 
german chancellor helmut kohl meanwhile said he and gorbachev 
already had agreed that germany would send food and rail shipments 
could begin as early as next week 
the soviet union has had bountiful harvests this year but a 
breakdown in distribution has led to more spoilage than usual in 
addition many rural communities are holding back food shipments 
for their own use or for barter 
the bushgorbachev talks focused on the persian gulf crisis and 
the two leaders emerged with a conceptual agreement that the 
use of force to push iraq out of kuwait could not be ruled out 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
gorbachev in his speech at the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe dwelt little on the political and economic 
crisis facing his country but warned that nationalist and 
separatist forces threatened to undercut steps toward democracy and 
a market economy in the soviet bloc 
it has been generally recognized that the historic shift 
occurring in the soviet union away from the totalitarianism to 
freedom and democracy to a state anchored in the rule of law 
and political pluralism from the state economic monopoly to a 
diversity of equitable property ownership constitutes a major 
change in the world he said 
but some people were failing to consider the wellbeing of 
europe overall and were practicing militant nationalism and 
reckless separatism he said a clear allusion to efforts by some 
soviet republics to quit the union 
they may spell conflicts animosity the balkanization or 
what would be worse the lebanization of entire regions he 
said 
rising ethnic tensions and efforts to change europes post1945 
borders could have a destructive snowball effect if any 
government gives way to them he noted 
a breakthrough in sovietamerican relations has been pivotal 
in improving the international climate he said noting that it 
was five years to the day since he held his first summit meeting 
with thenpresident ronald reagan beginning the thaw in 
ussoviet ties 
our country has changed and will never be the same as it was 
before he added we have opened up to the world and the world 
has opened up in response 
no matter what difficulties the soviet union faces today it 
will remain a great european power in line with its enormous 
potential gorbachev said 
in washington house majority leader richard gephardt welcomed 
bushs comments on food aid and said they placed the united 
states firmly on the side of democratization peaceful change and 
economic reform in the soviet union 
gephardt came under sharp criticism last march when he suggested 
us aid for the soviet union particularly from bush and other 
republicans who said such talk was premature

a 13yearold leukemia victim whose father sought 
unsuccessfully to have the boys twin half siblings tested as 
potential bone marrow donors died monday 
jeanpierre bosze died at his home in suburban hoffman estates 
family attorney edward jordan said his parents were at his 
bedside 
the boys father tamas bosze had unsuccessfully sought a court 
ruling to force nancy curran his former girlfriend and the mother 
of his 3yearold twin son and daughter to have the children 
tested as possible donors of potentially lifesaving bone marrow 
ms curran opposed the testing saying it could be painful and 
risky the supreme court in september affirmed a lower courts 
ruling in her favor 
meanwhile jeanpierres condition worsened and he was in and 
out of the hospital over the last two months jordan said 
the boy was released from lutheran general hospital in park 
ridge last week and his death had been expected for some time 
jordan said 
ms currans attorney extended her sympathy to the bosze family 
in a oneparagraph statement issued by her attorney 
the twins were born while bosze and jeanpierres mother to 
whom he is still married were separated ms curran had sole 
custody of the twins 
bosze approached ms curran about the possibility of the twins 
being tested after tests showed he the boys mother brother and 
halfsister were all incompatible 
he first petitioned the courts in june saying the twins would 
want to help their half brother if they were old enough to decide 
cook county circuit judge monica reynolds ruled sept 6 that 
forcing the twins to take a blood test to determine whether they 
could be marrow donors would violate their constitutional right to 
privacy 
bone marrow donations can save people with leukemia and other 
diseases if a donor with closely matching tissue types usually a 
relative can be found 
the marrow is extracted from the donor by inserting a long 
needle into the hip or breast bone doctors said the procedure is 
painful and donors risk infection complications from undergoing 
anaesthesia and the need for a blood transfusion because of a 
substantial blood loss

the arizona legislature voted monday to let 
arizonans pick their new governor feb 26 despite complaints by 
indian lawmakers that voters would likely be trapped at home by 
heavy snow on reservation roads 
the bill setting a date for a runoff election between 
gubernatorial candidates fife symington and terry goddard was 
approved by the legislature and then signed by gov rose mofford 
symington a republican edged democrat goddard 497 percent to 
492 percent in the nov 6 election state law requires that a 
governor be elected by a majority of the votes cast 
rep benjamin hanley dwindow rock said he would file a formal 
protest with the us justice department which must approve all 
changes in arizona election laws because of previous violations 
involving indian and other minority voters 
i think the people up on the navajo reservation will be 
disenfranchised hanley told the house after his may 7 suggestion 
was rejected 
symington received about 4200 more votes than goddard but fell 
short of an absolute majority because minor candidates received 
more than 11000 writein votes 
hanleys attempt to change the election date was not supported 
by the navajo board of elections which told lawmakers in a letter 
that it had no problem with the february date 
but rep jack jackson dwindow rock the only other indian 
member of the house also voted against the bill which cleared the 
house 543 
the measure passed the senate 290 a short time later without 
debate and was then signed by the governor 
in addition to setting the runoff date the bill would suspend 
state law requiring a purge of voting rolls after each general 
election that will guarantee that citizens can vote in the runoff 
as long as they are registered at least 29 days before the runoff 
whether or not they voted nov 6 
the bill provides for no writein candidates which irked max 
hawkins who came in third with more than 10000 of the writeins 
hawkins a former aide of impeached gov evan mecham said he 
deserved to have his name on the runoff ballot and that the only 
reason to deny it would be to favor the major party candidates 
but senate judiciary committee chairman leo corbet rphoenix 
told hawkins that language in the 1988 constitutional amendment 
which established the new election rules is clear in limiting the 
election to the two top votegetters in the general election 
other provisions of the runoff bill suspend 
campaigncontribution limits to allow people who made maximum 
contributions to the candidates during the generalelection 
campaign to donate again for the runoff and appropriates 3 
million to pay for the election 
voters added the runoff requirement in reaction to the 1986 
gubernatorial election in which mecham won a threeway race with 40 
percent of the vote 
mecham was impeached and removed from office on charges of 
misusing state money and obstructing justice in 1988 but ran again 
this year only to be defeated in the republican primary

french premier michel rocard on monday night 
narrowly survived a noconfidence vote in parliament despite an 
alliance of the normally friendly communists with the opposition 
conservatives 
the motions failure allowed rocard to retain his post though 
the ninth and most serious challenge to his twoyearold government 
left his future uncertain 
the showdown vote came after a dispute over a tax reform bill 
but opposition leaders also attacked rocards handling of the huge 
student protests that have shaken paris and other cities the past 
month 
the opposition mustered 284 votes five short of the absolute 
majority needed in the 577seat assembly to bring down rocards 
government 
had rocard lost president francois mitterrand would have faced 
the choice of dissolving parliament for elections or naming a new 
premier 
the government feud occurred while officials of 34 nations 
gathered in paris signed a conventional arms reduction treaty and 
discussed the postcold war order in europe rocard and president 
francois mitterrand represented france 
the troubles of rocard 60 mirror a battle facing another 
summit leader british prime minister margaret thatcher she could 
be toppled tuesday in a challenge for the leadership of her 
conservative party 
the communist party in an unprecedented break with the 
socialist government had sided with three conservative groups in 
parliament to block social security tax reform 
the result of the voting was announced by national assembly 
president laurent fabius a former socialist premier close to 
mitterrand who was the likely candidate to replace rocard had the 
motion gone through 
socialist lawmakers gave rocard prolonged applause the premier 
thanked them for their votes and said he hoped parliamentary 
business would continue smoothly 
the censures failure is not a victory for the government 
insisted andre lajoinie head of the communist partys group in 
parliament they only lacked five votes the government did 
not win the match 
the three main rightwing parties the rally for the republic 
party the union for french democracy and the union of the center 
filed the noconfidence motion friday 
the conservatives together control 260 seats while the 
communists hold 26 the socialists hold 272 seats and 19 assembly 
members are independent 
while all but one communist deputy voted for censure several 
conservatives defected joining 14 independents in not approving 
the motion 
charles millon the union of the centers leader in the national 
assembly began the debate by saying rocards two years in power 
had brought french society to a crisis 
our society has never seemed so divided our youth so 
anxietyridden our state so weak millon said 
the french expected much of you millon said you have 
deceived them you have succeeded in making the streets the 
most frequented pulpit in our country 
rocard had proposed a 11 percent social security tax that would 
replace part of the existing social security contributions paid by 
employers and employees 
the communists and conservatives said the reform would levy 
taxes on some previously exempt retired and unemployed people they 
also claim it could be raised in coming years 
rocard maintains the bill will streamline the tax system and 
reduce the tax burden on most poor and middleincome people 
the dispute was considered the biggest threat to rocard since 
mitterrand named him prime minister after the socialists regained 
effective control of the national assembly in 1988 
lacking an outright majority in the assembly the socialists 
have relied in the past on abstentions by the communists to defeat 
conservativesponsored censure motions but the communists had 
pledged to vote to censure this time 
its the first time the communist party will have crossed the 
yellow line fabius said before the vote 
fabius 44 rocards chief socialist rival was forced out as 
prime minister in 1986 after the socialists lost parliamentary 
elections 
rocard scored higher this year in public opinion polls than any 
other french politician but his current problems are exacerbated 
by the tide of antigovernment sentiment

dissidents who have sued to regain 
property held in trust by leaders of their polygamist community on 
the utaharizona line are entitled to a financial accounting a 
federal judge ruled monday 
an attorney for the dissidents characterized the order by us 
district judge bruce jenkis as a significant victory for his 
clients but a defense attorney said it would make little 
difference in the threeyearold case 
the order is the latest in the legal battle between the leaders 
of the adjacent towns of hildale utah and colorado city ariz 
and about 35 residents who claim they were wrongly evicted from 
their homes for dissenting from some religious tenets of their 
breakaway mormon sect 
the plaintiffs many of whom still live in the twin communities 
of about 3000 are seeking to dissolve the trust contending the 
leaders have misappropriated funds and commingled religious and 
municipal money 
followers pledged their land homes and a percentage of their 
incomes to the trust the trust owns most of the property in both 
communities the dissidents say they were promised the property 
eventually would become theirs in exchange for development or 
contributions to the community 
the communities were founded in the 1920s by a group bent on 
practicing polygamy 
while the mormon church abandoned polygamy in 1890 in exchange 
for utah statehood thousands of fundamentalists continue the 
practice in remote enclaves in utah idaho montana arizona and 
mexico they believe it remains a commandment essential for a 
persons eternal welfare polygamists once were hunted down but 
utah authorities now ignore the practice 
the sects longtime prophet leroy johnson died three years ago 
at age 98 plunging the communities into a power struggle and 
federal court he left at least 15 widows 
rulon jeffs who lives in salt lake county eventually emerged 
as the sects prophet and visits the communities and other small 
polygamist colonies scattered in the two states 
jenkins ruled the plaintiffs can require an accounting of the 
trust despite defense arguments that the proper venue is state not 
federal court 
jenkins said that although utah law holds that state courts 
exercise exclusive jurisdiction over matters of trust law 
this court adopts the general principle that federal courts 
should usually reject state legislative attempts to limit the reach 
of federal jurisdiction 
jenkins also denied the leaders motion to quash subpoenas for 
their bank account records and their request for a protective order 
that would keep the plaintiffs from examining the material 
jenkins denied the plaintiffs motion for a partial summary 
judgment making the transfer of their property to the trust null 
and void saying the legal status of the trust whether it is 
private or charitable has not been determined 
salt lake attorney jeff swinton who represents the plaintiffs 
said jenkins orders are very significant rulings to give us the 
rights weve been trying to get for three years in the courts and 
for many years before 
he said the ruling would enable the discovery process to 
continue but that it might force a delay in a scheduled dec 20 
pretrial hearing if all the information cannot be obtained by that 
time 
defense attorney scott berry said that while his clients would 
comply with the order we dont believe the plaintiffs access to 
those accounts will make any substantial difference 
theres no smoking gun its more of a big nuisance than a 
setback berry said 
of some 35 motions in the plaintiffs original complaint about 
20 remain to be resolved either by the judge or at trial swinton 
said

iraq said monday it will send 250000 more troops into kuwait 
mikhail s gorbachev refrained from supporting a un resolution 
allowing use of force to resolve the gulf crisis but agreed with 
president bush in paris that the military option cannot be ruled 
out 
the additional soldiers saddam hussein is sending will more than 
double his countrys military strength in the conquered emirate and 
give iraq a superiority others cannot match according to the 
iraqi news agency 
ina announced the buildup 11 days after bush said america would 
send 200000 more soldiers to the persian gulf bringing the us 
force to about 430000 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the new iraqi 
deployment another instance of him saddam thumbing his nose at 
the united nations 
he said in paris the development emphasizes that we must keep 
the pressure on with regards to un sanctions it also underscores 
the cynicism with which saddam hussein treats the hostages 
the united nations has tried in 10 un resolutions to force 
iraq through an economic squeeze to quit kuwait which iraqi forces 
invaded on aug 2 iraq kept thousands of foreigners from leaving 
after the invasion and used many as human shields at potential 
iraqi targets 
bush was in paris for signing of an arms reduction treaty by 
nato and warsaw pact members he used the gathering to try to win 
more support for a un resolution authorizing an attack to drive 
iraq from kuwait but soviet president gorbachev balked at 
endorsing the idea 
bush and gorbachev met for a late dinner that focused in large 
part on such possible use of military force 
fitzwater told reporters in a joint briefing with gorbachevs 
new spokesman vitaly ignatenko we are united on this issue we 
have a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out 
he said the leaders discussed the circumstances that might 
prompt a military offensive against iraq but we simply have not 
reached the point of decision yet 
the united states continued its buildup by loading hundreds of 
jeeps trucks and armored vehicles aboard the first of 20 to 30 
ships that are to sail from rotterdam netherlands a dutch army 
spokesman said 
the united states says its buildup should be completed by 
january 
analysts have said a military strike by the multinational forces 
is most likely in winter because of lower temperatures and 
generally calm weather sandstorms usually occur in april 
most of the us troops in the gulf region are in saudi arabia 
and bush scrapped planned rotations for them when he announced the 
us buildup 
those first soldiers were deployed after iraq overran kuwait 
and they are the foundation of a multinational force of about 
350000 troops 
iraq is believed to now have about 170000 troops in kuwait and 
about 250000 men in southern iraq 
ina said saddam met with his military commanders on monday and 
decided to send 250000 more soldiers 
it is worth mentioning that according to military 
considerations the percentage of attacking force to defending 
force is 3 to 1 the news agency said this means the united 
states will need to mobilize a 3 millionstrong force with similar 
equipment and armament to our forces if it is to attack 
the superiority will thus remain at its required standard 
which the others cannot match 
there was no indication of where the extra regular troops would 
come from iraqs army totals 555000 regular troops and 480000 
reserves 
western military analysts say iraqs reserves are poor in 
quality 
but its regular army includes about 120000 elite republican 
guards who led iraqs offensives in the closing stages of iraqs 
198088 war with iran they also led the invasion of kuwait 
iraq announced its troop buildup a day after it said it would 
free the estimated 2000 remaining westerners hostages in iraq and 
kuwait between christmas and march unless something would take 
place that mars the atmosphere of peace 
saddam has been releasing westerners a few at a time including 
136 sunday that group included 75 americans 67 of whom flew home 
from london arriving monday night at dulles international airport 
outside washington 
bush called the iraqi announcement abid to buy time this 
cynicism of starting to release them on christmas day will be seen 
by the world as a total ploy he said 
french presidency spokesman hubert vedrine said monday in paris 
that baghdads latest initiative will not modify frances 
position that un resolutions regarding iraq must be strictly 
applied including unconditional release of all western hostages 
and complete withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
bush and prime minister margaret thatcher warned that fighting 
might erupt unless iraq withdraws 
but some us allies including the soviet union and germany 
have expressed concern that bush is rushing toward war they say 
the un trade sanctions imposed on iraq should be given more time 
to work before force is used 
in other developments monday 
high winds and rough seas forced marines to cancel a second 
attempt to storm a saudi beach in an amphibious landing exercise 
officials said no further attempts will be made 
diplomats waited to see whether iraq would follow through on a 
promise to release about 50 more hostages edgar oehler a swiss 
parliamentarian said they included swiss nationals 25 of various 
nationalities working for swiss companies and others 
bush has indefinitely postponed a meeting with king hussein of 
jordan the royal palace in amman said the meeting was to have 
been held in paris a government source claimed bush put off the 
meeting after hussein criticized the us administration for its 
stance on the gulf crisis 
german chancellor helmut kohl demanded in a latenight news 
briefing in paris that iraq release all hostages before christmas 
saying holding captives does not lessen the dangers of war 
kuwaits government in exile indicated approval tuesday of use 
of nuclear arms against iraqi forces in kuwait sheikh naser 
alsabah minister of state for foreign affairs was asked in an 
interview by a canberra australia radio station so you 
wouldnt be unhappy if nuclear arms were used alsabah replied 
for the application of the international law not at all

boris n yeltsin the chief rival of mikhail s 
gorbachev demanded monday that the soviet president consult with 
the 15 republics before putting into effect gorbachevs plan to 
reorganize the national government 
national lawmakers on monday told gorbachev to return to 
parliament in a month to deliver a progress report on his plans to 
solve the countrys mounting economic and ethnic crises 
yeltsin president of the russian federation the largest 
republic berated gorbachev for proposing the restructuring without 
consulting the republics and said such a decisionmaking process 
is unacceptable to russia 
yeltsin said the soviet people should be allowed to vote on 
their central governments performance 
the developments added to the pressure on gorbachev who faces 
growing anger over his domestic policies 
lawmakers from the left and right are demanding stronger 
measures for regulating chronic shortages of food settling issues 
of the republic drives for more freedom from the kremlin and 
ending a power struggle with yeltsin 
yeltsin and even gorbachev have referred to the government 
crisis as a paralysis of power laws implemented by the central 
government are being ignored or overridden by many republics 
including russia which are seeking greater control over political 
and economic affairs 
gorbachev went before lawmakers saturday and won preliminary 
approval for a government reorganization that would eliminate the 
post of prime minister held by his embattled supporter nikolai i 
ryzhkov and put the entire executive branch under presidential 
control 
the reorganization also would create a powerful new council of 
republic leaders 
however lawmakers showed monday they would not settle for just 
passing gorbachevs proposals they approved a preliminary agenda 
for the dec 17 session of their parent parliamentary body the 
congress of peoples deputies that says gorbachev must deliver a 
progress report on his plans according to news reports 
the parliament itself must approve the agenda when it convenes 
it was stated by the deputies that the presidents report 
should not include the analysis of the situation in the country 
but it should rather include an account of the practical measures 
undertaken by the president according to the government 
newspaper izvestia 
the agenda also called for discussion of gorbachevs proposed 
union treaty to unite the soviet republic in a new federation his 
proposals for reorganizing the government and unspecified 
amendments to the soviet constitution the official tass news 
agency said 
it said the agenda also included legislation to create rules for 
holding national referendums discussion of rules on elections to 
fill vacant legislative seats and one on ejecting lawmakers from 
the supreme soviet legislature and confirmation of the new soviet 
prosecutor general 
the 542 members of the supreme soviet are chosen from among the 
2250member congress which has final parliamentary authority and 
has met only four times since its founding in 1988 
the vote monday came as yeltsin in his first public reaction to 
gorbachevs proposals demanded gorbachev consult with leaders of 
the 15 republics before implementing his reorganization plan he 
also complained that gorbachev never talked with them before 
proposing the plan 
that means that again knowing that the republics wont 
approve of it kremlin leaders want to push it forward but their 
reaction will be opposite yeltsin said 
i am even convinced that all this will only make the situation 
in the country worse rather than improve it he said 
yeltsin also told the independent news agency interfax he found 
some of gorbachevs ideas disappointing but did not specify 
which ones he said he needed to study the proposals thoroughly 
the presidents suggestions are all aimed at strengthening the 
center he told interfax 
yeltsin in an address monday to the ukrainian legislature in 
kiev also compared gorbachev with former soviet leader nikita 
krushchev who started a limited reform drive when he came to power 
in 1953 it was a time when the center was trying to centralize 
everything and reforms came to an end yeltsin said 
he also said russia is ready for the implementation of a 
referendum on the entire presidency system and on the 
governments performance according to interfax he apparently was 
referring to the legislation that would set up a procedure for 
holding referendums but interfax gave no other details 
yeltsin was in kiev to sign a trade agreement with the ukraine 
as several other republics have 
gorbachev had urged the council of ministers be replaced by

the band milli vanilli was stripped of its 
grammy award on monday because other singers substituted for the 
pop duo on the bestselling girl you know its true album 
its the first time in the 34year history of grammys that an 
award had been taken away 
trustees of the national academy of recording arts amp sciences 
voted overwhelmingly to rescind the award given to milli vanilli 
members rob pilatus and fabrice morvan said academy president 
michael greene 
the academy hopes its action sends a clear signal to 
producers music packagers and record companies that they need to 
take very seriously their task of giving us and the public credible 
information on that packaging he said 
i do think its an isolated incident we are as upset about it 
as the public has the right to be 
the attorney representing pilatus and morvan said the pair 
already had planned to surrender the grammy 
my guess is when the academy read that they decided to beat 
us to the game attorney alan mintz said 
needless to say this is an emotionally trying time but 
pilatus and morvan are determined to prove to the world that they 
will come back strongly and demonstrate that they are indeed 
artists 
in a related development an oakland woman who bought her son a 
milli vanilli tape filed a class action lawsuit monday seeking a 
refund in light of the revelation that the duo didnt sing a note 
on the recording 
i want everyone to be able to get money back i dont want the 
producer in germany to profit from what he did to these kids 
sheila stalder said at a news conference in her lawyers san 
francisco office 
if the lawsuit filed in alameda county superior court is won 
anyone in california who bought milli vanilli recordings or 
attended the pop duos concerts would be entitled to a refund said 
lawyer alan caplan 
the lawsuit also seeks to recover profits and place them in a 
trust benefiting consumer groups as outlined in the states 
consumer protection statute caplan said 
pilatus 25 from germany and morvan also 25 and a native of 
the caribbean island of guadaloupe scheduled a tuesday news 
conference in los angeles to discuss the scandal they were 
unavailable for comment on monday 
a decision on the disposition of the 1989 new artist award will 
be made by an academy subcommittee dec 5 in new york 
pilatus and morvan the dancing dreadlocked frontmen for the 
group suggested the award go to the three singers who actually 
performed the vocals for milli vanilli greene said that was not 
a possibility 
in announcing its unprecedented move the academy said it 
recognizes that packaging groups is part of the music industry 
especially in the kind of eurodance music performed by milli 
vanilli 
but misleading record labels are unacceptable greene said 
the integrity of that album label copy obviously was flawed 
it said vocals rob and fab that was just absolutely false he 
said 
shortly before the academy announced its decision milli 
vanillis producer frank farian and record company arista 
records called on the duo to surrender the grammy 
initially i felt that this honor gave recognition to the 
entire milli vanilli team this has not however been the case 
farian said in a statement from frankfurt 
he said that by returning the grammy rob and fab can put this 
episode behind them and mark the beginning of a new career for 
themselves 
the lipsync controversy erupted last eek when farian disclosed 
to the associated press that others actually sang on the record 
credited to pilatus and morvan the photogenic pair also lipsynced 
their way through live performances including one at the grammy 
awards show farian said 
the album was distributed by arista records after farian 
confirmed the rumors aristas executive vice president roy lott 
said seven million albums embarrassing i dont mean the end 
justifies the means but we sold 7 million albums 
on monday lott said arista no knowledge of the deception when 
it released the album 
pilatus and morvan have alleged that arista knew they werent 
really the singers vocalists johnny davis charles shaw and brad 
howell reportedly sang on the milli vanilli record

a court ruled monday that a frenchman accused of 
sending 194 jewish children to their deaths in nazi camps can be 
tried for war crimes 
rene bousquet 81 who is accused of crimes against humanity 
was national police chief under the collaborating vichy government 
in world war ii 
appeals court judge albert moatty decided monday that bousquet 
can be tried by an ordinary court 
state prosecutors in september asked that bousquet be 
investigated in connection with the childrens deportation 
a lower court held in paris last month that bousquet could be 
tried only by the high court of the liberation formed in 1944 to 
prosecute officials of the government under nazi occupation that 
court has been defunct for decades 
moattys ruling allowed state prosecutors to resume their 
investigation of evidence uncovered by nazihunters 
the international league against racism and antisemitism hailed 
the decision france is a great country capable of looking into 
the dark times of its past the group said in a statement 
the lower courts ruling had infuriated human rights activists 
who feared bousquet would escape prosecution 
rights leaders say no highranking french officials directly 
involved in deporting and arresting 100000 jews during the war 
have been brought to trial 
serge klarsfeld a lawyer and prominent nazihunter has said 
senior government officials including president francois 
mitterrand appear reluctant to pursue the case 
bousquet was condemned in 1949 for alleged collaboration with 
the nazis but was freed for acts accomplished in favor of the 
resistance he freed some jailed resistance fighters when he was 
ousted from his post 
a federation of human rights groups organized an inquiry 
commission to determine why cases against bousquet and two other 
suspected war criminals paul touvier and maurice papon have taken 
so long 
touvier 75 is being prosecuted for his activities as a 
pronazi militia chief in lyon he was captured last year after 
spending years hiding out with the help of rightwing roman 
catholic monks 
charges against papon a former budget minister have been 
pending for seven years he has been accused of being responsible 
for the arrests and deportations of 1700 jews while a wartime 
administrator in bordeaux

raymond robert clark went silently to his 
death in floridas electric chair monday for shooting to death a 
scrap yard owner after forcing him to write a 5000 check 
clark 49 who died in the chair at 707 am est did not make 
a final statement the night before he expressed his real 
concern for the family of david drake whom he killed on april 
27 1977 said susan cary a gainesville attorney and unpaid 
advocate for deathrow inmates 
clark was the 25th florida inmate to be strapped into the 
electric chair since the state resumed executions in 1979 in all 
142 people have been killed nationwide since the us supreme court 
reinstated capital punishment in 1976 
under his fifth death warrant clark had been scheduled to be 
executed nov 14 but a pair of temporary court delays pushed it 
back first to saturday and then monday morning 
among those witnessing the execution was drakes 38yearold 
son gregory 
its wrong taking so long he said i would like to see 
the appeals system changed i am definitely for a person having an 
appeal but i dont think it should continue continue and 
continue 
he said he wanted to witness the execution because the person 
you can think of who you love the most was taken from you without 
saying goodbye i know my dad wouldve done this for me 
the victims wife donna drake did not attend 
my sorrow is for my husband she said in st petersburg i 
wont call it revenge its just a feeling that i owed this to my 
husband to make sure he clark didnt get back on those streets 
and do it again to someone else and ruin another family like hes 
ruined us 
clarks appeals were exhausted sunday when the us supreme 
court voted 81 to reject two emergency delay requests dissenting 
was justice thurgood marshall who opposes the death penalty in all 
circumstances 
clark and his young male lover abducted drake from a st 
petersburg bank parking lot drove him to a secluded area north of 
the city and ordered him at gunpoint to write a 5000 check clark 
then shot drake twice in the head 
when the pair couldnt cash the check they called drakes son 
and demanded 10000 for his fathers safe return 
police traced the phone calls to drake and ty johnston then 16 
johnston was arrested in california and was allowed to plead 
guilty to seconddegree murder in exchange for testimony against 
clark he received a 25year prison sentence and was paroled in 
1987 after serving nine years 
when drake was killed clark was on parole from california for 
the killing of a 14yearold boy

women who hold in their anger may think they are 
acting polite but they are also risking their lives a university 
of michigan researcher said monday 
mara julius a researcher at the universitys school of public 
health presented her findings over the weekend at a meeting of the 
gerontological society of america 
her survey of 372 women and 324 men revealed that women who 
habitually stifle high levels of anger had a death rate during an 
18year study period three times higher than women who release 
their anger however this did not hold true for men 
those surveyed ranged in age from 30 to 69 in 1971 when they 
were interviewed to study their behavior characteristics and 
whether they tended to hold in their anger or let it out followup 
mortality studies were done in 1983 and 1989 
anger suppression seems to affect the mortality rates of only 
those men who have high blood pressure or chronic bronchial 
conditions julius said 
suppressed anger is a significant predictor of mortality 
risk among women the study said 
julius said she could only speculate on the different results 
between men and women 
we are definitely trained differently she said there are 
different norms of expectation of how to behave 
while women are expected to show some emotions anger tends not 
to be one of them she said similarly anger tends to be more 
accepted among men julius said 
julius said she did not know if it could be proven that 
suppressed anger directly causes death but its an independent 
risk 
the results clearly supported the inference that gender is 
implicated in the relationship between mortality risk and 
angersuppression the study said

a national guard reservist who filed a 
lawsuit in an effort to block his deployment to the middle east 
began his journey to saudi arabia on monday 
sgt michael r ange 26 flew from the norfolk naval base to 
dover del before heading to saudi arabia said staff sgt 
rebecca marcum at fort lee she did not say when ange was expected 
to arrive in the middle east 
anges unit the 1450th transportation company of jefferson 
nc left thursday night to join a usled multinational force 
deployed to saudi arabia since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 ange 
stayed behind for army medical tests 
ange filed a lawsuit in us district court in washington last 
week arguing that he could not be sent to saudi arabia because 
president bush did not have congressional approval for the military 
buildup there 
a federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order 
to block anges deployment but scheduled a dec 10 hearing to hear 
a request for a permanent injunction 
ange also has argued that is medically unfit for duty saying he 
has stomach ulcers and foot and leg problems that prevent him from 
running and wearing combat boots 
army officials ruled saturday night that ange did not have a 
medical condition that would impair his ability to serve 
although ange said he believed he received an appropriate 
medical review he said there is a conflict of interests in 
having the army finding him fit to serve

the supreme court has refused to give cable 
news network permission to broadcast tape recordings of 
conversations between panamas gen manuel noriega and his lawyers 
cnn meanwhile is demanding the fbi return a box of recordings 
and papers related to the case the material was taken from an 
atlanta hotel room where a cnn reporter stayed 
the supreme court on nov 18 rejected an emergency request by 
cnn that was aimed at lifting a federal judges order forbidding 
the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose 
the vote was 72 
the emergency request had called the nov 8 order by us 
district judge william hoeveler in miami an unconstitutional 
prior restraint of free speech but only two justices 
thurgood marshall and sandra day oconnor agreed with that 
assessment 
voting against cnn were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun john paul stevens 
antonin scalia anthony m kennedy and david h souter 
the justice department had joined noriegas lawyers in opposing 
the request 
cnn president tom johnson called the courts decision a loss 
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship 
johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its 
possession over to judge hoeveler he said cnn is confident that 
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the 
prior restraint 
meanwhile many questions remained about the network material in 
the fbis possession 
cnn said the tapes and documents were taken by security officers 
from an omni hotel room that had been used by reporter marlene 
fernandez who had been covering the noriega story 
johnson said fernandez had not checked out of the room but the 
hotel staff apparently mistakenly cleared out her room 
after taking the box from the room the hotels security guards 
saw that some of its contents were cnn property he said they 
turned the material over to turner security officers from whom the 
fbi took the box 
johnson said it was still unclear how the fbi was notified about 
the box 
turner security which provides security for the cnn center 
complex which contains both the hotel and the cnn offices had a 
discussion with the fbi inquiring about stolen government property 
and turner security told them they had a box that might fit that 
description cnn spokesman steve haworth said cnn denied the 
material in the box was stolen 
haworth said turner security a subsidiary of cnns parent 
company turner broadcasting systems inc did not tell 
appropriate cnn officials it had the box 
the new york times quoted an unidentified cnn official as saying 
the actual noriega recordings were not in the box 
the fbi did not get the main course the official said

daily 
backers of the newspaper have run into a miserable advertising 
climate and skepticism about the potential audience for a daily 
publication devoted exclusively to sports 
peter o price will continue to hold the titles of president and 
publisher but will be involved with broad nonoperational issues 
hammond said

the rollout into new markets the national is available in nine 
markets with plans to expand into three more

the philadelphia inquirer said nov 12 it 
had been given permission to count about 33000 subscribers that an 
industry panel had previously cut from its circulation figures 
the newspaper said the audit bureau of circulations board had 
exempted it from an interpretation of rules that had disallowed 
38957 subscribers from its circulation figures 
the chicagobased bureau citing its policy of confidentiality 
declined to comment 
the ruling means the inquirer will report average daily 
circulation of 519894 for the six months ending sept 30 a gain 
of 14991 over the same period last year 
the previous ruling would have cut the official inquirer 
circulation to 485973 and dropped it from 12th to 16th place 
among us newspapers 
at issue was a marketing effort that delivered newspapers to 
suburban readers two or three days a week only 87 percent of these 
newspapers were delivered however prompting the bureau to 
eliminate all 38957 from the inquirers circulation 
the inquirer protested noting that the marketing program had 
been in effect since 1985 in new jersey and more than a year in 
pennsylvania suburbs and had been implemented in consultation with 
the bureau 
the newspaper did not dispute the 87 percent figure blaming 
missed deliveries on independent distributors 
the inquirer appealed to the bureaus board asking that 87 
percent of the 38957 be counted the board upheld its position 
that 100 percent delivery is required for special programs but 
exempted the inquirer and agreed to count 87 percent or 33392 
fancher said 
our circulation gains are real and were undisputed by the abc 
staff and we believe the boards decision serves the best 
interests of all concerned inquirer publisher robert j hall 
said in a statement

cbs inc said nov 19 it expects to report a 
loss for the fourth quarter and decreased earnings from continuing 
operations for all of 1991 compared with this year 
the media giant said its anticipated loss for the fourth quarter 
stemmed from unexpectedly large losses at the cbs television 
network from broadcasts of major league baseball and a slowdown in 
advertising 
the last quarterly loss excluding onetime events at cbs was in 
the fourth quarter of 1986 when the company lost 20 million on 
continuing operations 
cbs earned 595 million or 231 a share in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 
it said earnings from continuing operations are expected to be 
lower in 1991 than in 1990 because of the worsening climate for 
advertising and rising costs for entertainment programs and sports 
rights 
the disclosures came as cbs senior exectives planned to meet 
with the cbs affiliates board 
earlier the network said its decision to dismiss three 
producers from its 60 minutes program was a result of a staff 
restructuring and was not related to belttightening in the news 
division 
the move was ordered after harry reasoner one of the shows 
first correspondents announced he would reduce his workload said 
spokesman roy brunett 
abc news meanwhile said nov 16 it will close its frankfurt 
germany bureau and three central american offices abc said last 
month it would close its chicago boston and dallas bureaus 
the latest moves were part of an overseas reorganization said a 
network executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
abc declined to comment on the frankfurt closing the network 
also said it would expand its moscow and berlin bureaus as part of 
a reorganization of its overseas operations 
about nine people will be let go because of the reorganization 
an abc source said 
abc news said it also would close its offices in panama el 
salvador and honduras but keep its nicaragua office open

president bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev joined european leaders today in signing a historic 
treaty that cuts conventional forces in europe and pushes the cold 
war deeper into history 
it is the farthestreaching arms agreement in history and it 
signals the new world order that is emerging bush said in a 
glittering signing ceremony 
the longsought agreement to destroy tens of thousands of tanks 
artillery and armored combat vehicles in europe is the most 
sweeping arms accord in history it was signed as prelude to a 
34nation summit originally called to discuss european security in 
the post cold war era but shadowed by the persian gulf crisis 
we are putting an end to the previous age french president 
francois mitterrand declared as he put his signature to the treaty 
documents one by one the other leaders followed suit with 
gorbachev the last one to wield the pen as the treaty was passed

paris ap president bush demanded today that iraqs saddam 
hussein turn tail 180 degrees and withdraw from kuwait british 
prime minister margaret thatcher said saddam has to be removed by 
force unless he pulls out soon 
the two leaders meeting over breakfast before a 34nation 
summit underscored their hardline stand against iraqs aggression 
the president also dismissed saddams proposal to begin 
releasing foreign hostages beginning on christmas this cynicism 
of starting to release them on christmas day will be seen by the

to release all remaining hostages by march as a cynical ploy and 
won the strongest endorsement yet from an ally for a un 
resolution authorizing an attack on iraqi forces 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said saddam hussein 
can avoid war only by withdrawing quickly from kuwait 
most people understand evil has to be stopped either he 
withdraws or the military option has to be used she said after 
breakfast with bush in paris where nato and warsaw pact leaders 
signed an arms reduction treaty 
but other key western allies germany and italy said all 
options short of war must first be exhausted

hussein has a chemical weapons arsenal at least as dangerous as 
iraqs us experts say 
the two nations are believed to be the biggest producers of 
chemical weapons in the mideast creating hundreds of tons of the 
deadly gas each year world attention has focused on iraqs 
chemical capability in the three months since its unprovoked 
invasion of neighboring kuwait

over syrias support for international terrorism and its hardline 
positions against israel have warmed in recent weeks since the 
syrians joined the antiiraq coalition 
syria has promised to send 15000 troops to join the usled 
multinational force arrayed against iraq in saudi arabia

promises have been made a year after 
africans braved tear gas and gunfire to shout for democracy in more 
than a dozen capitals but not a single oneparty government has 
been unseated 
fifteen regimes have said they would accept multiparty rule but 
there is no sign that democratically elected administrations will 
replace any of them soon 
leaders who could not crush protest movements with troops and 
arrests have turned to delaying tactics while paying lip service 
to democracy with promises of free elections critics say they use 
a bag of dirty tricks to stay in power 
those who mimicked the communist system and told their people to 
look there for inspiration were taken at their word when east 
europeans started demanding freedom 
after the collapse of communist parties in the soviet bloc the 
writing was on the wall for africas oneparty governments western 
nations that helped corrupt leaders in order to keep them from the 
soviet orbit found it difficult to justify more support 
there is no true development without genuine democracy 
jacques pelletier the french minister in charge of relations with 
africa said recently 
france is a staunch advocate of aid to third world countries 
but pelletiers comments echoed those of african opposition 
leaders not governments 
at a conference on africa herman cohen us assistant 
secretary of state for african affairs said governments that 
resisted their peoples demands for democracy would find themselves 
in an increasingly disadvantageous position in the competition 
for aid 
bans on opposition parties have been lifted in six countries 
benin cape verde gabon ivory coast sao tome and zaire 
nine have agreed to move toward ending oneparty government but 
opposition parties are not yet operating they are angola 
cameroon congo guinea bissau mozambique niger rwanda somalia 
and zambia 
the first show of unrest came from benin where protesters 
stoned a statue of lenin they blamed the nations bankruptcy on 
the marxistleninist ideology adopted by president mathieu kerekou 
who gained power in a coup and demanded his resignation 
kerekou renounced communism in response and said his government 
was writing a new constitution to liberalize the economy and 
guarantee human rights in a move later copied by president mobutu 
sese seko of zaire he appointed a transition government but set no 
date for himself to step down 
mobutu shocked zaire in april when under intense pressure from 
the united states and other western backers he said he would give 
in to demands for multiparty democracy 
student unrest continued and belgium the former colonial power 
accused zairean commandos in may of killing more than 100 at 
lubumbashi university mobutus government claimed only one student 
was killed and blamed local government officials 
in november six months after mobutu legalized opposition 
parties soldiers still were breaking up their meetings 
on nov 6 opposition leader etienne tshisekedi said mobutu had 
ordered him prevented from leaving the country to meet with 
secretary of state james a baker iii in the united states 
other leaders like president daniel arap moi of kenya 
gnassingbe eyadema of togo and joseph momoh of sierra leone have 
said no to change and often have called out soldiers to enforce the 
decision 
gabon moved closer to democracy than the others when president 
omar bongo was forced to conduct the first multiparty general 
election in 22 years 
several rounds of voting had to be held because voters smashed 
ballot boxes burned government cars and attacked officials they 
claimed were rigging the election 
bongo emerged with a bare majority in the national assembly but 
his term as president does not expire for three years 
ivory coast held its first contested presidential election in 
october police dispersed opposition campaign rallies with tear gas 
and clubs on election day voters smashed ballot boxes and claimed 
fraud 
governmentcontrolled television and radio denied the opposition 
access until the campaign was nearly over then censored their 
statements 
laurent gbagbo a history professor was the only opposition 
candidate two others could not raise bonds equivalent to 80000 
each which the government announced as a requirement one week 
before the 10day campaign began 
everyone expected the victory of president felix 
houphouetboigny the octogenarian who has ruled since independence 
from france in 1960 but many doubt he got the 8167 percent of the 
vote his government claims

in a hollow square at the front of the plain 
wooden church a group of singers wages musical warfare with a 
songs harmony 
they bellow notes at the top of their lungs to put the tune in 
mind singing a capella without piano or other instrumental 
help 
their sparse strong harmonies vibrate through the wooden pews 
in chestnut grove baptist church as they read an oblong book in 
which each of the four musical notes is shown with a different 
shape triangle circle rectangle and diamond for easier 
reading of the music 
the singing is called sacred harp shaped note or fasola it was 
common in the united states in the 19th century but soon faded 
because it was considered too crude by churches which instead 
relied on imported compositions and a modern sevennote scale 
almost unknown outside tennessee alabama georgia and 
mississippi by the 1930s it survived in the deep south why 
because as singer buell cobb says you didnt have anyone 
stomping around telling people it was no good 
but survival is no longer a question 
the fourpart a cappella harmonies are claiming passionate 
converts from chicago to california they are drawn to the 
primitive deep sounds and to the sense of community old book 
singing brings to all who sing and who listen 
in september 400 shapednote singers from 21 states 
gathered in chicago for a twoday convention of the united sacred 
harp musical association it was the first major fasola convention 
outside the south in 87 years 
the northern resurrection of the genre came as fasola declined 
in the south where singing schools gave way to modern 
entertainments the singers whose churches no longer relied on 
circuit preachers went to church each sunday and attended singings 
less often 
every year you lose about seven or eight allday singings in 
the south because there arent enough singers to keep it up said 
ted mercer the unofficial leader of the chicago singers 
some of the chicago singers are so committed to preserving the 
music they want to retire in the south to sing more he said 
kathleen throw a singer from st louis who was visiting ider a 
town in northeast alabama believes that urban northerners are 
doubly appreciative of the sense of community that comes with 
fasola singings 
singers often speak of being grabbed or knocked off my 
feet when they first hear sacred harp signing 
i was so stunned they were singing at decibel levels i 
didnt think the human voice could reach i have never in my life 
heard anything like it chicago singer judy hauff says of the 
first singing she attended 
the chicago singers began with photocopies of sacred harp music 
searching out hugh mcgraw and his sacred harp publishing co in 
breman ga the company is working on the first major revision of a 
sacred harp book since the 1930s with 65 new songs 
hauff and mercer returned to chicago determined to have 
authentic notesingings and all that went with them dinner 
memorials and the singings 
the allday singing in ider on the second sunday each october 
listed in church records as early as 1927 is the old style at its 
richest 
singers range from 87yearold leonard lacy to 19yearold 
jeffrey wootten and a mouthwatering noon meal of fried okra 
turnip greens chicken and other favorites is set out 
unlike traditional choral music sacred harp singing is not for 
the audience said cobb whos written the sacred harp a 
history of the music we have become a society that watches 
television that watches other people do things this is 
something that you do yourself he said 
he believes the music represents an old rural way of life many 
southerners tried to escape but that way of life attracts 
nonsoutherners says keith willard an aids researcher in 
minneapolis 
i think its hard for people in urban areas to achieve a sense 
of community to develop deep ties between neighbors im a 
scientist used to dealing with things rationally analytically 
this was like suddenly walking into a group of people and 
feeling at home he said 
willard who helped organize the first allday singing in 
minneapolisst paul appreciated the value of everyones 
participation 
there are lots of people who appear not to be too far away 
from death who are still coming and contributing and greatly 
appreciated by the other singers for what they can pass on he 
said 
marcia johnson a jewish lawyer from chicago who concedes its a 
bit odd for her to be singing the praises of jesus says the 
music has universal themes 
im 52 years old and i sometimes used to think about whether 
my friends or family would die before i did i know now that as 
long as there are singers i will have people that i love and who 
love me she said

from accused senators a familiar defense 
they broke no laws no senate rules breached no guidelines because 
there were none from an accuser a suggestion that there is indeed 
a guiding standard and that it should lead a senator to avoid 
conduct that would appear improper to a reasonable intelligent 
person 
that draws a line that could prove more important than the 
itemized inquiry into the conduct of five senators under 
investigation for their dealings in behalf of charles h keating 
jr and his effort to fend federal regulators away from his 
nowfailed savings and loan business 
the senate ethics committee and eventually voters will judge 
the acts of the men involved in this case the broader question of 
congressional conduct will remain after those judgments have been 
rendered it will persist even if congress reforms its campaign 
finance system writes regulations on dealings with and for 
constituents who seek intervention with a federal agency 
thats one of the things members of congress do for a living 
the question in this case is whether it was done for keating 
because of his campaign contributions to the senators involved he 
once said he certainly hoped so 
the senators insist they acted to make sure a constituent and an 
employer was being treated properly by government regulators 
sen howell t heflin dala chairman of the ethics panel 
summed up the dilemma in two observations as he opened the hearings 
thursday 
many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your 
services were bought by charles keating that you were bribed that 
you sold your office that you traded your honor and your good 
names for contributions and other benefits heflin told the 
accused senators 
but he also warned against a standard of conduct that could make 
congress too timid in going to executive and regulatory agencies in 
behalf of constituents with grievances 
outlining the case against the senators robert s bennett 
special counsel to the committee said he agreed that members of 
the senate can properly pressure regulators 
the difficult questions come in defining what is proper and 
when 
bennett offered one answer in describing a wellrecognized and 
established appearance standard to govern conduct 
a senator should not engage in conduct which would appear to 
be improper to a reasonable nonpartisan fully informed person 
bennett said such conduct undermines the publics confidence in 
the integrity of the government ad is an abuse of ones official 
position such conduct is wrong in addition to appearing to be 
wrong 
that has the ring of common sense but it relies on the judgment 
of the beholder 
sen alan cranston dcalif one of the accused senators said 
that under the guidelines bennett wants applied a senator would be 
afraid to act in behalf of any constituent who had contributed to 
his campaign no matter how legitimate the issue 
then again keating was no ordinary contributor he gave 49000 
for cranston campaigns and 850000 to voter registration funds the 
senator was pushing 
cranston who is suffering from prostate cancer and has said he 
will not seek reelection in 1992 complained that bennett wants to 
judge the accused senators on the basis of rules which have never 
been written and standards which have never been applied he said 
that deprives the five senators of guarantees the constitution 
grants every citizen 
the other senators are dennis deconcini dariz donald w 
riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
bennett has recommended that the case against glenn and mccain be 
dismissed 
the complaint that there are no rules so none were broken has 
been heard before in congressional ethics cases 
the late sen thomas j dodd of connecticut raised it in 
defending himself against ethics accusations in 1967 saying he 
faced senate discipline for rules formulated after the fact by the 
very committee that considered his case he was censured by the 
senate for using funds raised through testimonials and campaign 
solicitations for his personal benefit later there were rules 
on that conduct it was sanctioned so long as it was disclosed 
when he quit as speaker of the house in 1989 jim wright claimed 
there was uncertainty in the rules under which he was accused of 
violating house restrictions on gifts and outside income members 
are entitled to know what the rules mean wright said suggesting 
that the house set up an office of counsel to provide official 
advice on ethical questions 
in the current case the decision of the committee and of the 
senate on the accused senators will draw lines for future conduct 
without the campaign finance reforms that so far have failed to 
pass congress there are sure to be more situations linking 
constituent favors and campaign contributions 
unless these trends are recognized and dealt with we will 
have more cases like this bennett warned and the reputation 
of this body and its members will be in utter ruin

motown actually turned 30 almost two years 
ago but sundays twohour cbs special motown 30 whats goin 
on is worth the wait 
its not the starstudded musical spectacle that was motown 
25 yesterday today forever winner of a 1983 emmy an naacp 
image award a directors guild of america trophy and a george 
foster peabody award 
it is full of stars and it is full of music but this time it 
also is full of ballet opera filmmakers humor and a marching 
band 
motown 30 is a retrospective of africanamerican 
contributions to every aspect of the entertainment industry and 
while motown 25 gave us a moonwalking onegloved michael 
jackson its successor gives us a long look at how far black women 
and men have come in this country 
and how far we all have yet to go 
the show was taped at the hollywood pantages theater on oct 22 
before a formally attired mostly black audience that included 
motown founder berry gordy and sammy davis jrs widow altovise 
but the fourhour event was no pompous hollywood affair this 
was a house party and everyone was in the mood 
the program opens with the jackson state university marching 
band thundering down hollywood boulevard blasting a funkedout 
version of i heard it through the grapevine 
trumpets and tubas blaring the gyrating formation marches into 
the pantages down the aisles and onto the stage the audience is 
ecstatic 
it goes uphill from there 
the talent lineup includes smokey robinson stevie wonder 
terence trent darby the temptations the four tops denzel 
washington robert townsend tracy chapman natalie cole keenen 
ivory wayans gladys knight patti labelle and the dance theatre of 
harlem 
comedian whoppi goldberg impersonating diana ross talks about 
the importance of motown yeah you could dance to it yeah 
everyone knew the words 
but its also about a whole lot of other things too a 
search for respect a hunt for heroes a pride in accomplishments 
all that good stuff goldberg says 
a lot of us wanted to be a whole lot of things we wanted to 
be the temptations we wanted to be hip and cool and rich and happy 
and some of us wanted to be white 
but weve gotten over that 
discrimination is a common thread through most of the shows 
segments from comedy bits to musical numbers to tributes to black 
filmmakers 
in 1960 tv guide published an article called what does the 
negro want from television says keenen ivory wayans creator 
and executive producer of the hit fox comedy series in living

retorts his brother and costar damon the same thing they 
want in 1990 to be on it and get paid

offers her memories of what the world looked like to a little black 
girl who dreamed of being a ballerina 
as a young girl i had to have a great imagination to picture 
myself as a ballet dancer she says introducing the dance 
theatre of harlem because in everything that i saw and in 
everything that i read i didnt see anyone who looked like me 
the music from gladys knight fronting the 100member soul 
children of chicago choir to a showdown between the temptations and 
the four tops is a raucous blend of soul and gospel 
patti labelle and michael bolton team up square off is more 
like it for a salute to the partnership of marvin gaye and tammi 
terrell ending with sweatdripping rendition of youre all i 
need to get by 
labelle not known for being a shrinking violet onstage may 
have gotten more than she bargained for with the equally unretiring

executive producer suzanne depasse who won an emmy for motown 
25 says this is the last birthday special motown will not turn 
40 at least not on television 
that was it said the longtime colleague of motown founder 
gordy with whom she now heads gordydepasse productions formerly 
motown productions 
this show was meant to do something else depasse said i 
will never be able to replace motown 25 in my own recollection 
that was the first time i was on a solo flight in a way this is a 
wonderful farewell to that whole 22year segment of my life 
in the programs crowded finale stevie wonder leads the

its very simple how james burke host of 
tonights twohour pbs special after the warming got involved 
with the project 
burke after all is the british tv journalist whose toprated 
pbs series connections and the day the universe changed 
taught american tv audiences that science culture and technology 
could fascinate 
maryland public television asked me to do a program on global 
warming and i said you mean the 175000th program on global 
warming and they said do you think you can do something 
different i said yeah 
that turned out to be a pretty big yeah even for burke who 
spent seven months researching after the warming which was 
filmed on four continents 
at its heart is scientific opinion that its likely the gases 
emitted by our civilization carbon dioxide methane nitrous 
oxide and the artificial cfcs are warming up the planet 
no one can answer that question until maybe the end of the 
century burke acknowledged if you think its fractionally 
more than 50 percent likely then the odds are infinitely worse 
than what you do when you spend money to insure your life and your 
health and your house 
if its more likely than less likely then we should insure 
against it 
using advanced video graphics and special effects burke creates 
a virtual reality chamber of the 21st century 
it is the year 2050 when the planetary management authority 
celebrates its 50th anniversary as the earths environmental policy 
agency 
taking the greenhouse effect as a fait accompli burke lets us 
look back on history as a function of climate and he does it 
in the witty erudite style that has endeared him to his fans 
2050 was a way of saying look if you insure yourself you 
can end up with a world that isnt simply a result of the 
greenhouse effect but is the kind of world you should have 
anyway burke said 
he chronicles ice ages planetary orbital variations the 
emergence of human life civilization art architecture culture 
industrialization and colonialism as products of the influences of 
nature on humankind 
then suddenly mans use of the planet for the first time 
begins to influence nature and things get complicated 
burke looks back at how the nations of the world tried to 
cope with the phenomenon it is a sad bumpy kind of history with 
human suffering storms floods famine political conflicts and a 
new generation of boat people 
burke sees a planetary authority a supranational consensual 
nonauthoritarian agency as inevitable as carbon allocation 
rights which would force factory nations to buy surplus carbon 
emission rights from nonindustrialized nations 
the greenhouse effect turns out to be the trigger for 
handling the problem in the relationship between us and the third 
world and their economic aspirations burke said 
whether we like it or not we did con them into taking all 
that arab oil money 
whether we like it or not we did turn them into service 
agencies in the 19th century and we did rape them and plunder and 
pillage them and we did pollute the planet in doing so 
weve got to face the fact that we are guilty of all these 
things and do something straightforward about it 
i want people to realize this and then make their decisions 
they may just say yes we understand everything you say and they 
can go hang well fine but rather let them go hang on the basis 
of a mature and informed decision 
theres another reason burke agreed to do global warming he was 
in the midst of a financing hangup for the complexity effect a 
sevenhour tv series on the effect of information as the basic 
force in evolutionary change 
heres a preview of that coming attraction 
information surges in whatever form they come always have 
the same effect on all life forms burke said they either 
drive them to failure or they drive to success through increasing 
complexity 
for seven long crucifyingly boring hours im going to try to 
prove that 
 
elsewhere in television 
please dont feed the animals the 15th annual circus of 
the stars takes to the airwaves on cbs tonight ladies gentlemen 
and television writers of all ages take note this is yet another 
reason to get into show business

americans have been having a terrible time 
finding the stop spending button on the governments keyboard 
the inability is astounding during a hightech age in which one 
worker at a computer console can direct an entire factory operation 
or the flow of electricity through power lines or raise almost any 
statistic known to man 
but finding the off button on spending even under the 
stress of an economy on the edge of recession eludes them the 
country seems unable to go on an austerity budget after a decade of 
spending and borrowing 
the difficulty is more sharply defined each day in government 
where taxes rise while the economy weakens in business where 
expenses rise but sales fall in notforprofit institutions where 
services grow but funds shrink 
of course its an old old story in the typical american 
household which is being urged to spend more than before in spite 
of what the conference board says is the biggest decline in 
consumer confidence in two decades 
throughout the economy among employers employees elected 
officials investors bankers brokers borrowers everyone seems 
to be saying the same thing stop spending but few are able to 
find and click the stop button 
to many people the most egregious example of the phenomenon was 
in raising federal taxes while the economy flashed danger signs 
consider some of them 
the federal reserves monthly report on economic conditions 
around the country showed each of the 12 districts reported either 
slower growth or an actual decline in economic activity through 
midoctober 
construction contracts fell 28 percent in september the 
sharpest monthly drop since 1982 machine tool orders declined 46 
percent in september from the month before putting them 13 percent 
lower than the yearearlier level 
the national association of purchasing managers index of 
manufacturing activity declined to 434 percent in october the 
fourth straight month of declines anything below 50 percent 
indicates a shrinkage of activity 
in the first nine months of 1990 manufacturing failures rose 
20 percent nonmanufacturing failures 14 percent and services 85 
percent according to dun amp bradstreet big debt overspending 
played a large role of course 
since january 600000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared 
and many thousands of jobs have been lost in banking securities 
accounting management consulting health care and government 
overspending had a lot to do wit it 
initial claims of unemployment insurance have soared and 
those who remain working are likely to have shorter hours than 
before the average work week fell to 342 hours in october from 
347 hours in september 
but federal government spending in spite of rhetoric to the 
contrary continued to rise now so also are taxes 
john sloan president of the national federation of independent 
business comments that smallbusiness owners feel betrayed by 
congress raising their taxes main street he said is not a 
happy place these days 
why cant the stop spending key be found how can so many 
people call for the key to be tapped but then find it so difficult 
to find 
perhaps it is because minds were programmed during the 1980s a 
decade of easy credit free spending and low saving and among 
those programmed it seems were the very ones who should have been 
taught to find the key

less than two years ago south 
africa and eastern europe shunned each other as ideological 
villains 
today the south africans have diplomatic or trade arrangements 
with poland romania and hungary and are expanding contacts with 
the soviet union and czechoslovakia 
dramatic political and social changes on both sides have made 
them eager to renew relations after decades of enmity over 
communism and apartheid 
we were at the other end of the world both geographically and 
ideologically foreign minister rf botha said on a trip to 
czechoslovakia after the changes in both parts of the world 
there is nothing which divides our governments 
botha and czechoslovak officials announced plans to establish 
lowlevel diplomatic ties after a 27year hiatus in august trade 
minister kent durr became the first south african cabinet member to 
visit the soviet union in 34 years 
ideology drove the two sides apart in the 1950s and 1960s 
economics is bringing them together in the 1990s 
the south african government invoked the threat of a communist 
takeover for decades as justification for suppressing the black 
opposition 
this year president fw de klerk legalized all opposition 
groups released african national congress leader nelson mandela 
from prison after 27 years and promised to end the apartheid system 
of racial segregation 
which have isolated south africa economically and politically 
east european countries supported the sanctions and backed the 
anc and its ally the south african communist party 
then in 1989 came the upheaval that dismembered the soviet 
bloc and swept communist parties from power in moscows former 
satellites those nations are struggling to rebuild their crumbling 
economies and have found a willing trade partner in south africa 
although they still oppose apartheid east european countries 
have switched from being the main financial support of the anc to 
dealing with the white government it sought to destroy 
delegations from eastern europe visit south africa regularly 
permananent representatives have been exchanged and trade 
agreements signed thousands of eastern european and soviet 
citizens have applied to south african embassies in western europe 
for permission to immigrate 
i am pleased that the dynamics of late 20th century political 
transformation are bringing our two nations once again closer 
together durr said in opening the first polish trade fair in 
south africa 
poland dropped trade restrictions against south africa on march 
9 the day after durr completed a visit in late october the 
governments signed an agreement to establish reciprocal offices of 
interest 
polish government and trade officials traveled to south africa 
for the twoweek trade fair which featured nearly 50 manufacturers 
of products ranging from heavy machinery through textiles to vodka 
organizers said contracts worth 60 million were signed 
the visitors emphasized their continued opposition to apartheid 
but it was clear that relations had been made more palatable by 
polands economic problems and south africas reforms 
poland is heavily in debt and is beginning to make its 
economic relations with the rest of the world much more active 
said andrzej zawislak an economist and member of parliament 
zawislak said some western countries had urged poland not to 
establish ties with south africa but did not identify them 
romania and south africa signed an agreement last month for a 
joint trade committee that would meet annually and specific trade 
contracts are expected 
south africa has opened a permanent office in hungary to 
represent its interests and hungary plans to reciprocate 
hungarian officials said their country still opposes apartheid 
but wants the office because about 20000 people of hungarian 
descent live in south africa 
african nations also are warming to south africas reforms only 
malawi has full diplomatic relations but several have trade 
missions in pretoria and de klerk has visited seven african 
countries since taking office in august 1989 
his government says it trades with every african country mostly 
in secret 
mandela has sought funds for the anc in africa western europe 
the united states and asia but has yet to visit eastern europe or 
the soviet union which provided most of the movements military 
aid while he was imprisoned

as many as 7 million american adults may be 
suffering from a brain disorder they dont know they have its an 
affliction first described in the medical literature in 1902 but 
its name is still being debated 
the disorder once thought to affect only children is best 
known as the hyperactive child syndrome it is now called attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder residual type adhdrt when it 
persists into adulthood 
most of these adults know something is wrong but they dont 
know what says dr alan zametkin a psychiatrist and researcher 
at the national institutes of health in bethesda md 
the attention deficit is like a fever it tells you something 
is wrong but it doesnt tell you what a lot of things disrupt 
attention depression anxiety schizophrenia 
up to 85 percent of those afflicted could be helped with 
medication if they knew they needed it 
it was once thought that a hyperactive child treated with a mild 
stimulant ritalin would outgrow the disorder by puberty that is 
still true in some cases but researchers now believe the disorder 
persists into adulthood in 40 percent to 60 percent of all cases 
the disorder is the most common reason for a child to be 
referred to mental health professionals 
scientists now know that outward hyperactivity is not always a 
symptom but that is the most common manifestation among children 
a child appears motor driven cannot concentrate cannot stay in 
his seat acts impulsively cannot wait for his or her turn speaks 
out in the classroom cannot cope with stress bullies classmates 
has few social skills and an insatiable need for attention 
it is generally accepted that five times more boys than girls 
suffer the disorder but one yale pediatrician feels that girls are 
greatly undercounted 
the disorder untreated can destroy lives 
one married woman now in her 50s always knew something was 
wrong but her doctors could never pin it down she knew she wasnt 
stupid or depressed or anxious or whatever the diagnosis was 
it was something she just couldnt describe the difficulties of 
her life everything was too hard required too much effort she 
had to concentrate intently to perform such rote chores as making a 
bed she chose to remain childless for fear of passing this 
disability on to a baby 
but science is making progress toward helping people like her 
in midnovember zametkin announced in the new england journal 
of medicine a new finding that defines a specific abnormality in 
the brains of attention deficit victims this is the first large 
study of hyperactivity that shows some sort of metabolic 
abnormality he said 
the brain is essentially two brains the primitive brain below 
and the cognitive brain above sometimes referred to as the horse 
and rider 
zametkins study of 50 hyperactives and 50 normal people found 
brain metabolism significantly lower in 30 of 60 specific brain 
regions among the hyperactives 
commenting on the study dr paul h wender of the university of 
utah said that the basic cause may not be in the lessened activity 
in the cortex or upper brain 
if the more primitive centers dont tell the guys upstairs to 
wake up they wont have attention but the problem is not in the 
cortex its the guys downstairs 
dr ivan goldberg a new york city psychiatrist specializing in 
psychopharmacology and treating some adult cases says the 
reason the diagnosis is often missed is that it is never even 
considered 
one who agrees is dr barry garfinkel director of child and 
adolescent psychiatry at the university of minnesota he is 
chairman of the committee that will seek to redefine and perhaps 
rename the disorder for the diagnostic and statistical manual the 
next diagnostic bible due out 1993 
we trained doctors to believe attention deficit hyperactive 
disorder disappeared with adolescence garfinkel says the 
patients knew better 
the absence of hyperactivity makes diagnosis less likely such 
was the case with one man blessed with extraordinary intellectual 
gifts 
i claw for every word in reading writing and speaking says 
the man who asked not to be identified he appears laconic as he 
struggles for precisely the right word 
his brain is cursed by a chemical imbalance it moves at the 
anguished gait of a tortoise for him to utilize his mental gifts 
requires great effort 
with medication ive had visions of things as they might 
be he says there were brief periods when i could hear myself 
think where the competing thoughts were drowned out and i could 
focus on one thing 
to add to his woes he is one of the few whose response to 
medication isnt satisfactory

this man had seen about 20 psychiatrists and psychologists and

freighters more 
than 5000 ships dead at the bottom in water so deep and cold and 
black that a scuba diver can lose sense even of which way is up 
these antiquities of the inland seas are in jeopardy made 
vulnerable by technology cold water diving is safer cheaper than 
it used to be the wrecks are easier to fid easier to loot 
now the great lakes graveyards have become battlegrounds in an 
underwater war on the one side are divers who believe in 
finderskeepers an accepted notion to many ever since diving 
became a common mans sport in the 1970s on the other are those 
who regard the relics as a national trust a wellpreserved 
chronicle of americas history 
enforcement officers from michigan to ontario say the laws to 
stop such looting are impossible to police there are too many 
wrecks too many divers so some preservationists have taken 
matters into their own hands 
on the western shore of lake huron for instance amateur 
archaeologists have become a band of undersea vigilantes after 
work the unlikely crusaders three schoolteachers and a county 
sheriffs detective strap on heavy air tanks and roll backward 
into the lake huron surf to visit the wreck of the north star 
the freighter went down on nov 25 1908 impaled upon the bow 
of its sister ship the northern queen the queen took on the 
stars crew broke free of the ships death embrace and made it to 
shore the star with its cargo of flour and wheat and shingles 
burbled to the bottom 
this time the divers take with them a reporter cold water 
streams in beneath the skin of neoprene dive suits so shocking the 
reporter curses the weight of the water drills like a spike into a 
tender eardrum 
the divers descend fading into the green dark the reporter 
hangs back waiting for the pressure to equalize and relieve her 
aching ear she hangs alone on a line stretched from ship to 
shipwreck bouncing wildly as the topside vessel the sand dollar 
rolls with the growing swells 
then hand under hand she slides along the rope sixty feet 
down the north star emerges disappears emerges again ghostlike 
in a snowstorm of algae and muck 
in the cold and the dark the reporter pulls upward measures 
her breathing then drops onto the giant engines of the 1908 wreck 
three stories deeper sanilac county sheriffs sgt garry biniecki 
one of the first to descend moves along the 300foot hull taking 
pictures making measurements 
they have 23 minutes to scour the wreck before the gases 
dissolving in their bloodstreams force them up all the while 
nitrogen in their air tanks transforms into a drug and they feel 
the titillating but deadly rapture of the deep 
biniecki and his comrades will bring back nothing more tangible 
than exposed rolls of film and scribbled measurements they have a 
new ethic what goes down stays down nothing is for the taking 
we want to keep our artifacts down there says team member 
jim stayer a high school science teacher and the sand dollars 
captain 
skirmishes between followers of the new ethic and the old have 
taken some unusual turns a researcher for a museum a 
professional stole an artifact from a wreck when one he took 
legally for the museum broke he was caught a team of divers 
amateurs all chained and padlocked the steering wheel of another 
wreck to prevent its theft it remains in place 
one lake michigan charter captain enforces his nosouvenirs 
policy by searching customers when they surface from wreck dives 
steve harrington a writer about shipwrecks who has converted to 
the new ethic confesses he still feels unclean because he once 
took spikes from a wreck it sounds corny future generations and 
all he says but its hard to look young divers in the eye

the great lakes huron erie ontario michigan and superior 
were for a period rich in history and lore the main american 
arteries of commerce 
timber to build cities floated down from the canadian shores 
iron ore to make steel sailed out of superior grain stone coal 
and copper filled cargo holds but the ships also carried human 
cargo and their belongings fur traders immigrants pioneers 
laborers homesteaders 
the wooden boats and steel freighters never were a match for the 
sudden fury of the inland seas where unexpected west winds in an 
afternoon can drive up waves three stories high 
the great storm of 1913 a sixday blow sank 10 ships and 
killed 235 seamen gales from 1878 to 1898 ravaged nearly 6000 
ships and sank more than 1000 of them 
modern ships have fared little better in 1964 a huron storm 
tore the ore freighter daniel j morell in half only one of its 
crew of 29 survived eleven years later the freighter edmund 
fitzgerald and its crew of 29 went down in superior seconds after 
the captain radioed that he was holding his own 
the great lakes have become an archaeologists paradise where 
the water is deep and cold decay is arrested and each wreck 
remains a frozen moment of history 
the preservation is so remarkable that bodies can last for 
years skeletons for centuries archaeologists excavating the wreck 
of the rockaway in lake michigan found the remains of salted meat 
in the galley and rope made from corn leaves still sitting in a pot 
used to mix caulking the schooner went down in 1891 
the sort of hollywood concept of what a shipwreck looks like 
actually exists in the great lakes said rockaway archaeologist 
ken pott from his museum in south haven mich short of a 
skeleton lashed to the wheel its all there 
for example the hamilton and the scourge two canadian 
battleships from the war of 1812 went down in 300 feet of water in 
lake ontario pott says a searcher using submersible cameras found 
the ship intact replete with cutlasses cannons guns bones and 
masts 
but the conservation work of maritime archaeologists such as 
pott is up against an army of black marketeers and souvenir 
seekers 
simple wood blocks that litter wrecks by the hundreds fetch 500 
in an antiques store collectors will pay 10000 for a ships bell 
or a wood steering wheel a carved ships figurehead is almost 
priceless 
such stripping was legal in michigan until 1980 when the state 
passed a law allowing salvage only under permit wisconsin only 
recently toughened its law all of the great lakes states and 
ontario outlaw stripping to some degree but some such as 
michigan are willing to grant salvage permits especially to 
divers picking up things for museums 
archaeological surveys take years the pillage can occur 
overnight witness the fate of the us coast guard cutter 
mesquite 
that crippled buoy tender was buried at sea last july dropped 
intact to the bottom of lake superior 
the stripping started immediately dinner plates from the boats 
galley tools from the work rooms hard hats from lockers dress 
jackets out of the closets of crew members 
i am appalled at what happened says michigan archaeologist 
john halsey in lansing it was like a feeding frenzy were 
talking in hours in days 
because of that many explorers go to great pains to hide their 
discoveries charles feltner an engineer for ford motor co found 
the 1856 wreck of the brig sandusky in the straits of mackinac he 
dove on it for years in secrecy then he made the find public 
people stripped the thing in a couple of months feltner 
says things like dishes tools all the blocks belaying pins 
deadeyes you name it 
the ships rams head figurehead remains divers bolted it back 
down after someone tried to steal it too 
that was 10 years ago feltner thinks the advent of divers such 
as biniecki signals a change in ethic today feltner feels the 
looting would take years not months 
its still bad enough to where divers 25 years from now arent 
going to have much to look at feltner says the whole idea of 
seeing a virgin wreck will be gone

editors note george mcgovern professor turned politician 
has returned to his roots at 68 hes back on a college campus 
teaching once again the onetime presidential candidate says the 
campaign trail still has its lure that forum he believes can be 
an attractive classroom itself 
</TEXT>

heads turn and passersby smile in 
recognition when george mcgovern walks along the stone paths of the 
cornell university campus 
you probably get this all the time but when i turned 18 you 
were the first person i voted for says a faculty member beaming 
as he shakes hands with the former senator from south dakota and 
1972 democratic presidential nominee 
mcgovern smiles thanks the man and chats briefly before moving 
on he does get that all the time ever since his unsuccessful bid 
for the presidency its nice he says 
since losing his senate seat in 1980 mcgovern has been teaching 
at colleges across the nation this semester he is at cornell 
where hundreds of students vied for spots in his onceweekly class 
on american foreign policy 
teaching is a return to his roots for mcgovern he began his 
career in 1949 as a history professor at south dakotas tiny dakota 
wesleyan university he spent most of the next three decades 
outside the classroom making a name in state and national politics 
and challenging the united states role in the war in vietnam but 
mcgovern says he never stopped considering himself a teacher 
that historic perspective has frequently given me a different 
view of events he says 
i really knew quite a lot about vietnam before we ever got 
involved and i always thought if you looked critically and closely 
at the history of vietnam we might never have gone in there 
mcgovern is 68 now his hair and eyebrows have turned almost 
white and the creases on his forehead have deepened in the years 
he has been out of the national spotlight 
dressed in a dark blue pinstripe suit and wearing thick black 
plasticrimmed bifocals that he takes on and off as he speaks he 
looks more like an elder statesman than a maverick politician who 
challenged the establishment throughout his tenure in office 
the tall exsenator cuts an imposing figure at cornell his 
steady voice with a hint of midwestern twang easily hushes the 300 
young people crowded into statler hall a blue and purpletoned 
auditorium in the colleges hotel administration school 
mcgovern lectures in a conversational style sprinkling his talk 
with references to his own involvement in shaping the nations 
history he tells students he doesnt want to be too partisan 
although he leaves little doubt where he stands and he sounds 
more regretful than angry when he speaks of policies he opposes 
in a lecture on the cold war mcgovern traces republican attacks 
on the democrats for losing china and being soft on communism 
to the gops frustration over having lost five consecutive national 
elections 
it set off a kind of political fury on the part of the 
republicans he says i can understand that he adds 
laughing after youve lost so many times you get to the point 
where you want to get somebody you just want to hit anybody 
he says the public had an exaggerated fear of the communist 
threat that dogged him throughout his political career he says he 
and others that called for negotiation not confrontation were 
labeled appeasers or worse 
i have no doubt at all id still be in the senate if not for 
this fear he says 
most of the students filling the lecture hall were still in 
diapers when mcgovern ran for president and not yet in high school 
when he left the senate but they say they knew his name and the 
views he represents 
i knew that he was a big liberal says audrey van voden a 
government major from syracuse 
i just knew he ran for president says julie brof a policy 
analysis major from new york adding that she thinks his class is 
fabulous

at the end of class mcgovern allows time for questions no one 
leaves the auditorium a student asks about political role models 
and mcgovern mentions adlai stevenson a fellow wouldbe president 
stevenson got me into politics and thats probably enough to 
persuade some people that he had an evil influence he says 
chuckling 
opposition to the vietnam war 
it just so happens i had dinner with sen fulbright last 
week mcgovern says fulbright he adds is most proud of the 
student exchange program he established in his first year in office 
in 1942 not the vietnam hearings he presided over 
responding to another students question mcgovern dismisses the 
impact of communism in the united states 
anyone here ever meet a real livemember of the communist 
party he asks one student raises his hand what did he look 
like mcgovern asks joining the audience in laughter 
after class mcgovern lingers for oneonone conversations with 
the eager students who swarm around him brof asks him to meet with 
the campus democratic organization and leaves delighted when 
mcgovern offers to have breakfast with the group 
i wish i had been around when he ran for president she 
sighs i was 2 years old 
after class over lunch in the hotel schools restaurant 
mcgovern says he hasnt ruled out running for president again if 
the opportunity presents itself he misses the national forum of 
the senate and especially of a presidential campaign 
whether you win or lose tens of millions of people hear 
you he says i do miss that if i really thought in any given 
campaign that i could get across certain ideas to the american 
public i might run for president just to make the case 
mcgovern blames recent leaders for failing to set a more 
altruistic example for the next generation the reaganbush years 
he says reassured people that greed is all right that raw 
competition with ones fellow human beings is the way things should 
be 
he sees the effects of that leadership on students he says 
reluctantly criticizing the young people who have always been among 
his biggest fans 
theres still a little too much materialism and not enough 
idealism he says i dont want to say that in any harsh way 
its just a mild disappointment on my part that material values 
still seem to dominate much more than any idealism 
but that materialism may be waning mcgovern says he hears it 
in the questions students ask and sees it in their growing activism 
on issues such as the environment he says he senses a growing 
desire for leaders who will put the interests of the public first 
i think theres a quickening of interest now he says it 
isnt as strong as it was in the 60s but i do think theres a 
modest comeback the trend is in the right direction 
mcgovern looks out the restaurant window at students rushing 
across the campus below he has high hopes for the future those 
young people represent and for the history that is yet unwritten 
perhaps he says the dramatic crumbling of eastwest 
differences over the past year means that the world is finally 
going to figure out how to live in peace even the persian gulf 
crisis may have a silver lining in that the united nations is 
emerging as an effective forum for resolving international 
problems he says 
for many years i have believed that what is now happening 
could have happened mcgovern says 
i guess ive always been an optimist i dont know how you can 
live any other way and get much out of life

editors note the struggle between the inkatha freedom party 
of zulu chief mangosuthu buthelezi and african national congress of 
nelson mandela has claimed some 6000 lives since 1986 some fear 
the struggle is the prelude to a fullfledged civil war in south 
africa heres a look at mandelas enigmatic rival a chieftain who 
extols zulu warrior traditions but advocates nonviolence in 
dealing with the white government 
</TEXT>

zulu chief mangosuthu 
buthelezi one of south africas most powerful black leaders is an 
enigma equally comfortable in various guises 
one moment he is in sharp business suits discussing free 
enterprise with world leaders the next he is attired in leopard 
skins with spear in hand leading zulu war dances 
buthelezi leader of the inkatha freedom party and head of the 
kwazulu black homeland portrays himself as a moderate but his 
views are rejected by growing numbers of blacks 
he advocates nonviolent resistance to apartheid and working 
with whites but his followers battle black opponents he advocates 
free enterprise although many blacks favor socialism he has 
alienated many blacks by saying that ending apartheid wont solve 
their problems 
supporters including many whites see buthelezi as the one 
black leader who can find a way for whites and blacks to live 
together in peace followers hail him as a pragmatist who refuses 
to make empty political promises 
critics who are more numerous denounce buthelezi as a tribal 
warlord a sellout to apartheid who wants power at any price they 
equate buthelezi with the dictators who rule many black african 
nations and accuse him of inciting black factional violence that 
has claimed thousands of lives 
patrick lekota a senior official of the rival african national 
congress accuses buthelezi of being a pawn of the ruling national 
party 
buthelezi is the national partys dog de klerk must rein 
in his dog he told a recent meeting 
president fw de klerks government which has promised to end 
apartheid has toyed with the idea of an alliance with inkatha a 
rainbow coalition of blacks and whites that would be a 
formidable political force 
some observers say ambition and personality differences are the 
root of buthelezis conflict with other black groups disillusioned 
former supporters accuse buthelezi of being despotic and unable to 
accept criticism 
his goal is to amass as much black support as possible so he 
becomes the leader of black south africans says zwelake sisulu 
a top black journalist 
buthelezi hits back at critics who accuse him of inciting tribal 
warfare 
i am accused of murderous warmongering which i strenuously 
refute i loathe the sickening murder and mayhem that is causing 
untold suffering he said in an oct 4 letter to the new york 
times 
whatever the truth most observers agree buthelezi will play a 
major role in deciding south africas future 
the struggle between buthelezis inkatha freedom party and the 
african national congress of nelson mandela has claimed some 6000 
lives since 1986 some fear the struggle is the prelude to a 
fullfledged civil war 
independent observers say both sides have helped incite the 
violence 
one of several hereditary chiefs and princes of the zulu royal 
house buthelezi says he is determined to destroy apartheid but he 
is ready to compromise with whites for peace 
for years buthelezi has said only peaceful negotiation and 
nonviolent resistance can end apartheid he insists the white 
minority must be assured their future is secure even if it means 
blacks have to settle for less 
my ideal is one person one vote in a unitary state he said 
in a published interview but i have always said we cannot afford 
to destroy the country in seeking that 
it is a message that appeals to many whites fearful of losing 
their wealth under any future black government but buthelezis 
message enrages many blacks who have lived in poverty for 
generations with no political rights and they accuse him of 
toadying to whites 
while other black opposition groups tend to blame apartheid for 
most of the suffering endured by blacks buthelezi warns that the 
end of apartheid will just be the start of their struggle for 
emancipation he warns blacks that they can only be free when they 
liberate themselves as individuals by hard work 
many people have nurtured illusions that will never come 
about once the euphoria of freedom passes we will return to the 
real world where the problems remain the same he said in an 
interview 
the anc and other groups call for redistribution of wealth from 
whites to blacks and favor some form of socialism many blacks 
equate capitalism with apartheid saying it has only benefited 
whites

james garner says he liked the script for 
decoration day so much it prompted him to break his rule of 
preparing for a role he read the book from which the tv movie was 
adapted 
garner plays a retired judge in the twohour drama set in 
georgia in 1975 the judge comes to the aid of a black man who 
refuses to accept a medal of honor for heroism won 31 years earlier 
in world war ii 
i hardly ever read the book after the script garner says 
you lose so much between the book and the script 
the problem is that when youre doing it you remember 
something from the book thats not in the script you dont want to 
fall into that trap it was probably left out for a reason 
the drama a hallmark hall of fame presentation on nbc on 
sunday was adapted by robert lenski from the novella by the late 
john william corrington 
i was familiar with the authors work garner says id 
read several of his books he lived in new orleans until he died 
about a year ago 
garner says that at this point in his acting career he looks for 
quality scripts 
i want things that have to do with people and the human 
condition he says i dont think you have to blow up cities 
and kill people to entertain its a pleasant script murphys 
romance was pleasant 
i had an opportunity to buy rambo this guy blows up a whole 
town and kills half the national guard because a cop offends him 
what kind of morality is that 
in decoration day the defense department suddenly realizes 
it has overlooked giving the medal to the black veteran he refuses 
the medal on principle and when his former employer writes the 
letter of refusal a government lawyer fears a white conspiracy to 
block the presentation 
garners character is albert sidney finch who retired from the 
bench after the death of his wife bill cobbs is gee penniwell a 
black veteran of world war ii and a boyhood friend of finchs until 
they grew apart 
judith ivey is a legal secretary who becomes close to finch when 
she prepares his case for penniwell ruby dee is finchs 
housekeeper norm skaggs is his nephew jennifer robertson is his 
nephews wife and larry fishburne is the government lawyer 
you wait for something wonderful to come along says garner 
who starred in the tv series maverick and the rockford 
files and such movies as the great escape the 
americanization of emily grand prix victorvictoria and 
murphys romance 
decoration day is the third hall of fame drama for garner 
who previously starred in promise and my name is bill w 
and the eighth for producer marian rees robert markowitz directed 
on location in georgia although the original story was set in 
louisiana 
i wear an indiana jones hat that was given to me years ago 
by stuart margolin garner says i had the brim cut down its 
one of those things you pull out of the closet most of the 
wardrobe is mine the pants the fishing vest it works better if 
you wear things that are yours 
garner who was wounded in combat in the korean war says he can 
identify with a veteran offered a medal years later 
when i was doing tank i mentioned that i had never received 
the purple heart he says i was with the 24th division our 
position had been overrun and all the records had been lost so as 
a pr thing the army gave me the medal so the fact that they want 
to give this man the medal of honor 31 years later makes sense to 
me it happened to me 
garners first major movie after the war was sayonara a 
1957 film in which he played a marine pilot 
i was doing sayonara when warner bros was looking at every 
actor in hollywood for maverick he says then they noticed 
me in the dailies and said lets use him hes already under 
contract i did the pilot and when i got back from japan i 
started maverick 
i got 500 a week the first season with no residuals i got 
600 the second year 1250 the third year my competition was ed 
sullivan who got 25000 a week 
both maverick and the rockford files are considered 
television classics 
its all luck garner says no its not all luck but 
there was a lot of luck involved 
he doubts he will do another series 
people have no idea how hard an hourlong series is he 
says even if i did a halfhour show id have to work hard 
especially to maintain the integrity of it

the daunting challenge of playing shakespeare 
and shaw oneill chekhov and others of the classic theater is 
proving irresistible to bigname american actors willing to take 
big risks in big stage roles 
in the past year on and off broadway and in regional theater 
such movie and television stars as dustin hoffman kevin kline 
stacy keach brian dennehy and william hurt have tried roles as 
challenging as shylock in the merchant of venice hamlet 
richard iii hickey in eugene oneills the iceman cometh and 
the title character in chekhovs ivanov 
three other wellknown actors hal holbrook philip bosco and 
jason robards are all tackling different productions of king 
lear this season holbrook currently stars as the raging monarch 
at offbroadways roundabout theater while the others plan to do 
the role next spring bosco at the folger in washington and robards 
at the american repertory theater in cambridge mass 
the pay is poor and the work is hard why do they do it 
when an actor does the classics he uses every muscle he has 
all of his imaginative physical and emotional resources says 
michael kahn artistic director of the shakespeare theater at the 
folger its like the olympicsits testing yourself against this 
great material and if you emerge triumphant you feel pretty good 
about yourself 
in england the switch from commercial to classical roles 
happens all the time mostly because the television movie and 
stage production centers are concentrated around london in the 
united states actors must shuttle between the east and west coasts 
and points in between to work 
a british star like diana rigg can chew the scenery in popular 
escapist material like mother love a pyschological thriller 
shown here recently on public televisions mystery and then 
play cleopatra in the 17thcentury play all for love by john 
dryden the actress will star in the rarely seen restoration 
tragedy next april at the almeida theater a small 300seat 
theater in london 
glenda jackson did bertolt brechts mother courage last 
summer and performers like ian mckellen john wood joan plowright 
and others appear regularly on stage while fitting in work on 
television or in the movies 
one reason american actors do less classic theater is that they 
have to plan their careers so far in advance hurt did ivanov 
for only six weeks at the yale repertory theater in new haven 
conn but the commitment required juggling and rejuggling of the 
actors schedule 
it is a luxury to be able to carve out the time from a busy 
schedule of television or movies to do the classics but for me it 
is absolutely essential says keach whose richard iii at the 
folger was cheered by washington critics and audiences i started 
in the classics ive always had to try and plan as best as i can 
to get back and do them 
still until he played the evil humpbacked richard iii 
keach hadnt acted in a shakespearean play for 15 years although 
he had starred in hamlet three times once at the long wharf 
theater in connecticut then in central park for the new york 
shakespeare festival and finally at the mark taper forum in los 
angeles 
part of the excitement is the element of risk 
youre making yourself extremely vulnerable because somebody 
might tell you that youre lousy holbrook says and its not 
like being lousy in an inconsequential part youre standing up 
there on the high board taking a big swan dive 
sometimes those dives can bomb 
al pacino using a brooklyn accent limped through a disastrous 
production of richard iii on broadway 11 years ago he wasnt 
much better playing mark antony in julius caesar at the new 
york shakespeare festival in 1988 an illconceived production that 
also dragged down such other usually fine actors as edward herrmann 
and martin sheen

profits in the nations ailing securities 
industry were an anemic 200 million in the first six months of 
1990 and have deteriorated since then wall streets leading trade 
group said sunday 
the securities industry association said wall street is starting 
toslash expenses beyond the nearly 50000 job cuts since the 1987 
stock market crash the outlook remains gloomy 
trading and underwriting of stocks and bonds has been depressed 
by drastically fewer mergers concern over the economy the 
yearold collapse of the junk bond market and reduced activity by 
individual investors 
the sia report said firsthalf 1990 profits barely reached 
200 million a sum not equivalent to a single decent bond issue a 
few years ago and indications are thirdquarter results will 
deteriorate further 
the industry made 18 billion last year 25 billion in 1988 
11 billion in 1987 and a record of more than 5 billion in 1986 
annual profits havent been below 1 billion since the 1970s 
the sia said industry revenue will not increase this year for 
the first time since the 1970s it said profit margins are below 1 
percent return on equity is under 2 percent and brokerage 
commissions are off 11 percent with no prospect for improvement by 
the end of the year 
george r monahan the groups director of industry studies 
said with the exception of the top 10 firms the industry has 
been doing an excellent job of cost reduction 
broker compensation is off about 6 percent from 1989 while 
commission revenue is down about 7 percent but at the 10 largest 
firms broker compensation is down 8 percent while commission 
revenue has slumped 16 percent 
wall street is notorious for its high compensation levels 
particularly during boom cycles such as the mid1980s when young 
investment bankers and other professionals quickly commanded 
sixfigure salaries stockbrokers on the other hand tend to 
receive less pay 
the sia said that when expenses are adjusted to exclude gross 
interest expenses compensation in the first six months of 1990 
accounted for 57 percent of total costs overall pay was down to a 
third of all expenses from 41 percent in 1987 the group said 
further compensation cuts are occurring yearend bonuses this 
year for highly paid investment bankers an important indicator of 
compensation trends are expected to be slashed 30 percent to 50 
percent at top firms 
that would bring compensation for investment bankers down to 
1985 levels wall street executives say still considered high 
many firms in recent weeks have laid off investment bankers 
including seniorlevel professionals because of declining 
business 
despite several rounds of cutting since the 1987 crash wall 
street pay last year still averaged more than 82700 per employee 
including clerks and secretaries the sia reported almost double 
the level a decade ago 
nearly 50000 jobs have been eliminated from the securities 
industrys peak employment of more than 260000 nationwide in 1987 
apart from compensation other costcutting appears to be more 
successful the sia said as expenses in all other areas are below 
1989 levels but monahan said even that may not be enough 
although longstanding practices are now being changed some 
firms still make payments to both profitable and unprofitable 
departments on the premise that business cycles will even this out 
in the end which may not happen he said 
separately the sia announced that thomas a james president 
and chief executive of raymond james amp associates inc a st 
petersburg fla brokerage was nominated as chairmanelect he is 
to serve as an sia officer and director in 1991 and become chairman 
in 1992 
the sia represents about 600 brokerage and investment banking 
firms in the united states and canada that account for about 90 
percent of securities activity in north america

as a child josef dundr would 
stroll with his father past the snug three ostriches inn a 
buffcolored 17thcentury building that had belonged to the family 
until the communists came 
my father would say this used to be ours maybe it will be 
again some day said dundr who was born there 44 years ago i 
didnt see that day coming i was so downtrodden by that time 
the communists no longer run czechoslovakia and the day may come 
after all 
on dec 1 the government will start selling or giving back to 
private owners 100000 restaurants small shops and other 
businesses the return of many factories and other large 
enterprises will begin next year 
in the new nofrills capitalism of czechoslovkia however 
individuals may lose out to economic expedience they risk losing 
their jobs as well as the chance of ownership but the winners can 
get rich 
officials cite the soviet unions many false starts in their 
argument against moving slowly all east european countries have 
lost time since their communist regimes fell last year but 
czechoslovakia now may be poised to outpace the others 
for people with money the switch to private enterprise is a 
golden opportunity not to be repeated in this century said 
miroslav zamecnik spokesman for finance minister vaclav klaus 
there are few guarantees in the new system 
dundr may not get the three ostriches back alena kubistova is 
not sure she will have a job when a private owner takes over the 
meat market she manages just off wenceslas square 
down the street ctirad fuchs 30 looks for a compromise 
between his wish to own the music and book store he manages and the 
interests of the buildings new owner 
president vaclav havel has warned that failure to protect such 
people as fuchs and the others could lead to unrest but appears to 
have yielded to klauss desire for quick reform 
when parliament approved the privatization law oct 25 the 
finance minister acknowledged it would not satisfy all 
completely 
dundr now assistant manager of the jointventure palace hotel 
considers the three ostriches a sure moneymaker it nestles at the 
foot of the charles bridge on the royal route to prague castle and 
enjoyed a good reputation even under state ownership 
he estimated its worth at 25 million to 70 million crowns or 
from 1 million to nearly 3 million 
emotion is deeply involved in the desire to get the inn back 
dundr said his father now 81 wants to feel that he can pass 
this on to his children and grandchildren 
his likely rival for the three ostriches is the man who runs the 
restaurant and the 18room hotel the state made from the family 
apartments above it dundr fears the managers connections in the 
bureaucracy give him an edge 
in a case like this millions are involved he said 
stamps can be issued documents can be signed 
if he gets the inn back dundr said he will fire the manager 
and staff of about 20 for inefficiency and rudeness 
zamecnik the finance ministry spokesman sees nothing wrong 
with such action the sooner they kick these people out the 
better he said 
under the privatization law property must be returned to former 
owners or their heirs or be auctioned local governments will set 
bid prices and any small business can be bought for a minimum of 
half the asking price 
even before the law was approved managers of staterun stores 
held brief strikes to express concern that czechoslovaks who got 
rich on the black market or through past communist party 
connections would have an advantage 
according to zamecnik the government will not examine buyers 
too closely because a quick change to private enterprise offers a 
way to put illgotten wealth back into legal circulation 
dundrs position is that the three ostriches should be returned 
to the family rather than auctioned it falls into a gray area 
however 
the family acquired the restaurant in about 1930 and was 
nationalized after communists took power in 1948 the dundrs kept 
the building until 1962 then turned it over as a cultural monument 
they could not afford to preserve 
to protect consumers the law requires that any shop going 
private must continue selling the same goods for one year but 
privatization is much farther along than efforts to cushion its 
effects 
there are no requirements for private owners to retain current 
employees or even to pay a minimum wage 
ms kubistova like most working czechoslovaks has no 
experience of market economics she was 3 years old when the 
communists took over 
after her first talk with the new owner of the meat market she 
said she is about 80 percent sure he will keep her on as manager 
at least for now 
her current salary of about 110 a month is above the national 
average but she said more important than pay is whether you will 
have a job 
fuchs would like to reach an agreement to own his music and book 
store and perhaps others of the approximately 100 in prague 
the store manager said he should have the chance not by right 
but because prague needs such stores managed by competent people 
culture as a commodity will not be very attractive when the 
price of paper and food go up he said wryly

advocates of utahs pioneering statewide 
ban on cigarette vending machines claim a victory in their war on 
tobacco citing statistics that show a modest decline in teenage 
smoking 
but in downtown salt lake city youths defiantly puff away and 
mock the ban 
i buy them at the store they never ask how old you are 
said dean who at 17 is two years under utahs legal smoking and 
drinking age if youre going to smoke youre going to smoke 
penni 16 gets cigarettes from friends or her parents 
if you cant get them that way you just rip them off or walk 
in and buy them nobody cares she said making her point with a 
long drag 
for 11yearold racheska its only slightly more difficult 
sometimes she says her mother buys them for her other times she 
buys them in convenience stores 
the image of racheska is a haunting one for chris chalkley a 
chief advocate of the states 15monthold prohibition on cigarette 
vending machines in public places the first such statewide ban in 
the nation 
everyone has their source i know its sad thats our 
challenge now tighter controls the vending machines were the 
first step said chalkley manager of the utah department of 
healths tobacco prevention and control program 
she insists the ban has coupled with antismoking education 
had some effect enough to spark similar efforts elsewhere 
minneapolis has banned cigarette machines and the new york city 
council this month voted to ban them in most public places 
pittsburgh has approved a requirement that cigarette machines 
accept only tokens whose sale would be controlled but it hasnt 
gone into effect yet 
chalkley cites student surveys showing that from 1987 to 1989 
the first year the ban took effect smoking in the 12to17 age 
group declined from 131 percent to 105 percent in utah 
a 1988 national institutes of health study estimated that on 
average 118 percent of americas adolescents smoke 
chalkley says that when legislators meet in january their 
agenda will include further proposals to shut off the tobacco 
pipeline to utahs youth including requiring stores selling 
cigarettes to post signs reading we id for tobacco sales 
other possibilities include requiring that tobacco products be 
placed behind sales counters and providing stiffer penalties for 
stores that sell to minors including revoking sales licenses 
little opposition to the measures is expected in this state 
where seven out of 10 people are mormons taught to abstain from 
tobacco alcohol coffee and tea 
currently selling tobacco to a minor is a misdemeanor carrying 
a maximum 500 fine and 90day jail term on the first offense 
1000 fine and six months behind bars on the second and 2500 
fine and a year in jail for a third offense 
really we need to put the screws on the convenience store 
operators or anyone else who sells cigarettes to people under 19 
we want to go after them said republican state rep hugh rush 
who sponsored the ban

atlantic citys gambling industry 
wants the state to loosen regulations introduce sports gambling 
and allow other changes that casino operators hope will help them 
last through the weak economy 
the most visible example of the downturn in atlantic citys 
gambling fortunes has been donald trumps taj mahal casino in a 
deal reached with bondholders this past week trump gave the 
investors half ownership in exchange for allowing him to delay a 
473 million interest payment also the interest rate on the 
bonds was cut 2 percentage points to 12 percent 
the casinos want roundtheclock gambling instead of the 
current 18hour limit on weekdays and 20 hours on weekends they 
also want to be able to take wagers on sports and open more than 30 
percent of their casino floors to slot machines 
casinos have also asked for relief from state regulations they 
consider onerous and costly in both time and money and the ability 
to easily introduce variations of existing games 
we have to get away from the idea that whenever a casino 
proposes something new its something bad said john sweeney 
the new director of the state division of gaming enforcement we 
cant be looking at everything they do in a suspicious manner 
the prospects for 24hour gambling are less certain than those 
for regulatory relief but industry executives are clamoring for it 
anyway the likelihood for sports gambling also is uncertain 
a bill that would allow sports betting in the casinos has been 
proposed by state sen louis bassano casinos do not anticipate 
benefiting much from the action but think it would bring new 
business to the city 
sen william gormley a republican senator who represents 
atlantic county home of the gambling resort doubts that new 
jersey is ready to emulate nevada and adopt legal sports betting 
given the current tenor after pete rose when people hear about 
betting and athletes and athletic competition it still gives them 
a certain hesitancy gormley said right now its something i 
dont have a high comfort level with 
a measure to open up more of the casino floor to slot machines 
appears to have the best shot of clearing the legislature 
assemblyman fred scerni has proposed raising the current 
percentage of floor space casinos are allowed to devote to slot 
machines from 30 percent to 40 percent 
the 30 percent limit is a holdover from the beginnings of 
gambling here when the founding fathers envisioned a traditional 
betting parlor emphasizing blackjack and craps 
but the slots have become increasingly popular among patrons 
and now account for 60 cents of each 1 gambled at the resorts 
dozen casinos 
its something wed really like to see said john belisle 
vice president of marketing for merv griffins resorts casino 
hotel the slots just continue to grow

leaders of the largest union at general 
dynamics incs jetbuilding plant say the new threeyear contract 
that was approved sunday was the best they could get considering 
the soft economy and the downturn in the defense industry 
we felt it was the best we could do without a long dispute 
said pat lane president of the 10000member international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers lodge 776 i 
know a lot of people would have had to suffer to greatly improve 
the contract 
we are still short on insurance and the bonuses but i feel 
it is the best contract we could get at this time lane said 
sundays vote came a week after the union which represents 
about onethird of the plants workers narrowly rejected a 
contract proposal nearly identical to the one that was approved 
the vote was 58351013 in favor of the new agreement said 
general dynamics spokesman mike hatfield the contract took effect 
at 1201 am today 
the union after narrowly defeating a proposed contract nov 11 
agreed to extend the deadline to midnight sunday rather than 
strike negotiations resumed thursday with both sides refusing 
public comment until sundays vote 
hatfield said the contracts terms include a 55 percent general 
wage increase the first year and 3 percent increases each of the 
next two years 
hatfield said general dynamics also will pay a 1100 
ratification bonus to each union member and cost of living 
adjustments projected to equal about 166 an hour by the end of 
the three years 
we set out some weeks ago when negotiations began with the 
intent to strike an agreement that would be equitable for both 
sides and i think we achieved that hatfield said 
the agreement could be considered a setback for the union which 
had originally sought a wage increase of 10 percent in the first 
year of the contract and 5 percent in each of the following two 
years 
but union leaders say the deal is the best they could negotiate 
given the soft economy and coming downturn in the nations defense 
industry 
in this day and age its a pretty good contract said union 
attorney rod tanner many members were hoping to obtain 
ratification bonuses in the second and third year but there just 
wasnt the money if it had the bonuses it would have been an 
excellent contract 
the negotiation committee worked very hard to try to obtain a 
better proposal tanner said although there were some aspects 
that were disappointing it was in the best interest of the union 
to accept the contract 
workers also told the dallas morning news that a temporary 
restraining order obtained by the company against pickets in the 
event of a strike may have intimidated workers 
despite the vote on the new contract union members seem 
uniformly pessimistic about the plants future from a peak 
employment of about 31000 the work force could fall to 25000 by 
1995 fort worth division general manager charles anderson said 
last week 
general dynamics has given notice to about 150 hourly workers 
that they will be out of a job by dec 14 and has said it will lay 
off 700 to 1000 salaried employees in the research and engineering 
department in january

bond corp holdings ltds struggle to 
stay afloat was complicated monday when investors in its jn taylor 
holdings ltd unit sought to have a provisional liquidator 
appointed for jn taylor 
the application was made in the supreme court in south australia 
state by 28 investors holding about 21 percent of jn taylor 
preference shares 
the move throws doubt on bond corps proposed debtforequity 
swap with its creditors which would put 90 percent of the companys 
stock in the hands of european bond holders 
jn taylors assets are a 139 million loan to another bond corp 
subsidiary bond corp finance and a 745 million loan to alan 
bonds family company dallhold investments pty ltd 
on friday bond corp released a letter written by bond corp 
executive chairman peter lucas to jn taylor in which he said 
neither bond corp nor bond corp finance was in a position to 
repay all or part of the debt 
an application to liquidate bond corp could be an avenue that a 
liquidator to jn taylor would pursue if bond corp did not repay 
its debt 
however bond corp executive peter lucas played down this 
threat monday and said if a liquidator were appointed to jn taylor 
he may well choose to take part in the debtforequity plan 
he also said a liquidator would not necessarily threaten bond 
corps restructuring 
however in the letter released friday lucas said dallhold had 
advised bond corp that if it were required to repay loans from jn 
taylor support for the plan could not be provided 
the orders being sought by the preference shareholders also ask 
for an auditor to investigate intercompany advances and agreements 
among jn taylor bond corp and bond corp finance

grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly 
higher this morning on the chicago board of trade but then 
weakened in early dealings 
this was based on talk of a hugh soviet deal with the us 
said william biedermann research director of allendale inc in 
crystal lake ill 
but this is strictly talk so far thats why prices weakened 
after the opening he said 
the opening surge was followthrough buying from last weeks 
strong close when the market sensed something was up because of 
active commercial buying 
but biedermann said the market is uneasy about taking prices too 
high until some stronger proof surfaces giving substance to the 
ussoviet rumors 
the markets saying i hear you but i want to see it he 
said 
biedermann said if the commercials are big buyers again this 
week it will be a pretty good indication that there is a deal 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 252 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cent higher with december at 225 a bushel oats were 
unchanged with december at 111 a bushel and soybeans were 
cent to cent lower with november at 566 a bushel

cbs inc said today it expects to report a loss 
for the fourth quarter and lower earnings from continuing 
operations for all of 1991 compared with this year 
the media giant said its anticipated loss for the fourth quarter 
was due to unexpectedly large losses at the cbs television network 
due to broadcasts of major league baseball and a slowdown in the 
growth of national advertising 
the last quarterly loss excluding onetime events at cbs was in 
the fourth quarter of 1986 when the company lost 20 million on 
continuing operations 
cbs earned 595 million or 231 a share in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 
it said earnings from continuing operations are expected to be 
lower in 1991 than in 1990 because of the worsening economic 
climate for advertising and rising costs for entertainment programs 
and sports rights 
the disclosures came as cbs senior exectives planned to meet 
today with the cbs affiliates board the board represents the 
networks 200some television stations affiliated with the cbs tv 
network 
it was reported last week that cbs may propose a cut in what it 
pays affiliates to carry the networks programs cbs has refused to 
comment 
this was the first year of cbss fouryear baseball contract 
which allows it to carry several regular season games along with 
the league championship series world series and allstar game 
while the network reportedly expected to lose about 35 million 
in the first year of the 106 billion contract the losses are 
said to have run migh higher cbs sports president neal pilson has 
said only that the loss on baseball was under 100 million 
in todays announcement cbs said losses on baseball were 
higher than anticipated as the result of soft demand in the ad 
marketplace for time on sports programs and because the world 
series and one of the two league championships were settled in four 
games instead of the maximum seven 
the short series meant cbs had fewer nights of baseball on which 
to sell advertising games later in a series also tend to draw 
bigger audiences making them more valuable to advertisers 
cbs said its tv network would have had a loss for the fourth 
quarter even without baseball however because of the soft ad 
marketplace 
it said the marketplace weakness has dampened demand for 
network local tv and radio advertising and said network ad prices 
have been particulartly soft for national football league and 
primetime broadcasts 
another reason for the anticipated decline in earnings from 
continuing operations next year is that the 1990 figures include 
profits on the coverage of the nfl super bowl and the national 
basketball association playoffs and championship that the network 
will not have rights to in 1991 
as a result the cbs television network is currently expected 
to show an operating loss in 1991 the statement said

the state oil monopoly plans to 
increase its capacity for oil production from the current 2 
million barrels daily to 42 million barrels daily by 1996 a 
newspaper reported monday 
petroleos de venezuelas ambitious expansion plans would cost 
about 20 billion according to the daily el diario de caracas 
which quoted oil sources it did not identify 
the newspaper said that while venezuelas production capacity 
would rise to 42 million barrels a day the country would have a 
production target of just 37 million barrels a day the oil 
monopoly had previously been planning to raise production to 35 
million barrels a day by 1995 
venezuela believes its increased capacity would be useful in 
dealing with international emergencies such as the current persian 
gulf standoff that initially cut off some 4 million barrels per day 
and drove up oil prices the newspaper reported increased 
production from various nations particularly saudi arabia and 
venezuela have virtually erased that shortfall 
the saudis have also recently considered vast expansion of their 
production capacity in what analysts view as a move to develop 
enough capacity to avoid future runups in oil prices 
venezuelas expansion plans depend heavily on attracting foreign 
investment in oil which is largely prohibited by the laws that 
nationalized oil in 1976 carrying out the plans would probably 
require congress to approve changes in the law

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
united states dropped for a second week with a reported loss of 21 
rigs since last week to 1103 baker hughes inc reported 
the decrease followed a drop of 20 rigs last week but remained 
above the count a year ago when there were 1040 rigs operating 
nationally two weeks ago the number of working rigs reached 1144 
a high not seen since dec 28 1987 
of the total rigs running as of monday 109 were offshore 26 
were in inland waters and 989 were on land the toolmaker reported 
baker hughes has kept track of the rig count the widely 
watched index of drilling activity since 1940 the count 
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil not those 
producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
wyoming and louisiana led the list major oil producing states 
reporting rig losses for the week with drops of 10 and eight rigs 
respectively other losses were reported in colorado down by four 
and michigan new mexico and oklahoma each down by three

the united auto workers union has ratified a new 
threeyear contract with chrysler corp tying up the last of three 
agreements with the nations big three automakers 
union members at chrysler plants ratified the new agreement by a 
margin of better than 4to1 the uaw said monday contracts with 
general motors corp and ford motor co were ratified by slightly 
smaller margins 
a date for signing the new uawchrysler contract hasnt been 
set 
in all more than 450000 active workers at big three factories 
warehouses and offices in the united states are covered by the 
contracts which provide manufacturing flexibility for automakers 
and wage security for their workers the contracts expire at 
midnight sept 14 1993 
each one provides for a 3 percent base wage increase in the 
first year and 3 percent lumpsum payments in the second and third 
years and increases for current and future retirees the contracts 
also provide for income guarantees for workers laid off from 
factories shut down because of slumping sales for more than 36 
weeks during the next three years 
as in all negotiations both sides scored some wins and some 
losses 
for the union perhaps the biggest win was bargaining nearly the 
same agreement with each of the automakers a pattern contract 
seemed probable for gm and ford but questionable for chrysler 
because of its weaker financial position 
however less than three hours after uaw president owen bieber 
met oct 30 with chrysler chairman lee iacocca the union and the 
company announced a tentative agreement fitting the gmford 
pattern 
the automakers failed to gain any immediate reduction in 
healthcare costs the uaw and the big three did agree in side 
letters to each agreement to work on cutting healthcare costs 
including exploration of a national health care system 
the companies faced with continued competition from japanese 
automakers and an overcapacity problem in their us factories did 
retain the ability to idle or effectively close unprofitable 
factories but it could come at a price 
each of the automakers agreed to set aside money as much as 
41 billion by gm to bring unemployment benefits for workers 
displaced at idled factories to 100 percent of their preshutdown 
levels

tens of thousands of workers made sick by 
asbestos will receive sharply reduced compensation payments from 
the manville trust under a plan unveiled monday to resolve the 
nations biggest product liability case 
the longawaited restructuring is designed to insure payments to 
victims of lung cancer and other respiratory ailments clear a 
court backlog and create a model for companies facing huge 
liabilities for asbestos products 
the plan includes up to 520 million in new contributions to the 
trust by manville corp which was driven into bankruptcy court in 
1982 by mounting asbestos lawsuits the trust was formed in the 
companys 1988 reorganization and faces more than 130000 claims 
these steps will more effectively efficiently and 
equitably compensate those injured by asbestos exposure manville 
chairman and chief executive tom stephens said in a statement 
the plan was expected to be approved by us district judge jack 
b weinstein who is leading efforts to resolve asbestos 
litigation the judge monday began a process to declare a class 
action to settle trust claims 
a restructured trust would pay asbestos victims according to the 
severity of illness rather than when a claim is filed the plan 
slashes plaintiffs lawyers fees to a maximum 25 percent of 
settlements 
it also includes dismissing tens of thousands of lawsuits 
against the trust pending in state and federal courts nationwide 
asbestos health claims form the biggest product liability issue in 
us history 
manville trust payments have averaged about 43000 but are 
forecast to fall more than half for serious diseases and even more 
for less severe ailments claimants are to receive a maximum 45 
percent of settlements until all claims are partially met 
it is a terrible compromise said heather maurer executive 
director of the asbestos victims of america an advocacy group 
representing 18000 people i3000 or 4000 is in any way just compensation 
for their diseases 
and deaths 
but architects of the plan said it was fair way to compensate 
victims given the limited funds available the restructuring was 
ordered by weinstein after the trust ran out of cash to pay new 
claims and said some would be deferred until long into the 21st 
century 
everybody is getting an equal share of the fair value of 
their claim said gene locks a philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer 
some people are going to get it a little faster than others 
asbestos is a white mineral with natural insulation and heat 
resistance used widely for decades in shipbuilding construction 
and other industries a high incidence of lung cancer and other 
respiratory ailments attributed to asbestos began appearing in the 
1970s 
under the manville plan payments would be made annually to 
claimants based on a percentage of the trusts available resources 
claims are split into two groups cancer and other serious 
ailments and lesser diseases 
payments would be made only to claims in the first group during 
the plans first two years an estimated 23000 such claims are 
expected to get some money the group includes relatives of workers 
who died before being compensated 
the more than 100000 claims in the second group would begin 
receiving payment in the plans third year payments are to be made 
first to those with hardships then according to disease severity 
then to claimants over 70 years old and finally to those who filed 
first 
despite the progress payments will not resume until weinstein 
holds hearings and reviews the plan or until expected court 
appeals by plaintiffs lawyers and other defendant companies are 
heard lawyers estimate that payments might not resume for a year 
or more 
the trust formed in 1988 has paid out more than 11 billion 
to settle nearly 26000 claims a total of 163000 claims have been 
filed and more arrive daily the trust has 434 million in settled 
but unpaid claims which will be met in full under the plan 
trust officials have blamed the cash crunch on more claims and 
bigger settlements than anticipated and faster case resolution 
critics have said the trust was badly managed doling out toolarge 
payments for minor ailments 
the reduction in plaintiffs lawyers fees from about onethird 
of settlements followed sharp criticism by weinstein 
the 25 percent limitation will over time provide the victims 
hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to 
their attorneys leon silverman the courtappointed adviser for 
the restructuring said in his report to weinstein 
dismissing lawsuits against the trust primarily over the size 
of or delay in settlements also should lead to savings the trust 
expects more than 50 million in legal defense expenses this year 
the plan establishes maximum settlements for specific diseases 
they range from 350000 for mesolthelioma a fatal respiratory 
ailment to 30000 for pleural disease expected median 
settlements are about 40 percent of the maximum 
payments to all manville claimants except those with urgent 
health or financial needs were suspended in july 
the washingon dcbased trust originally was funded with about 
3 billion in cash and manville securities its main asset is 80 
percent stock ownership of manville a denver manufacturing and 
natural resources company

top us and ec officials held a 
hastily scheduled meeting monday to try to narrow their differences 
on farm subsidies and rescue world trade talks from collapse 
ray macsharry the european community agriculture commissioner 
were scheduled over the weekend to discuss technical details of 
their respective farm proposals for the dec 37 conclusion to the 
uruguay round of global trade negotiations 
no details of the talks were made available 
the talks offered a glimmer of hope that progress could be made 
after a week of highlevel talks that left both sides sticking to 
their positions putting the successful conclusion of the trade 
talks in doubt 
an ec official who asked not to be named said it was the first 
time the two sides discussed the us and ec proposals in great 
detail 
they have gone away from rhetoric and are looking at the 
details of the ec proposal the ec official said of us 
negotiators that is an important development 
meanwhile in geneva the head of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade said he believed a substantial package of 
agreements was still possible at the dec 37 session gatt is 
sponsoring the trade talks 
arthur dunkel told a press conference that although talks were 
still deadlocked on farm subsidies progress had been made in other 
important areas such as efforts to reduce restrictions on trade in 
textiles 
the sticking point in agriculture is the amount of cuts in 
subsidies and export subsidies the ec has offered a 30 percent 
subsidy cut in the 19861996 period while the united states wants 
a 75 percent reduction in the 1990s plus a 90 percent cut in export 
subsidies 
yeutter gave the uruguay round talks a less than 5050 chance of 
success on friday after he and senior us officials held talks at 
the ec head office 
but macsharry has insisted the two proposals are broadly 
similar when only the overlapping time frame is considered on 
monday the ec source said such technical issues were at the heart 
of mondays meeting 
the trade talks cover more than a dozen other negotiating areas 
ranging from textiles to services and intellectual properties 
in geneva dunkel said negotiators had agreed on a single 
framework text on trade in textiles a trade source said the text 
provides for the phasing out of existing restrictions in textile 
trade but added there was no consensus on how fast the barriers 
should be eliminated 
dunkel also said there were still wide rifts over rules to 
prevent goods from being dumped on world markets at 
artificially low prices

said lee godfrey lead counsel for the plaintiffs many class 
members who will be vested by this agreement have no other vested 
pension rights 
robert j malinak a houston attorney representing chevron in 
the proceedings termed the settlement a reasonable resolution of 
the claims the settlement was announced as a monthlong trial 
resumed monday in federal court in houston in which the plaintiffs 
want nearly 600 million restored to the gulf pensioners plan 
the plaintiffs claim surplus money in the gulf pension plan 
should not have been lumped into a merged fund with money from the 
chevron pension plan when chevron merged the two pension plans in 
1986 
the suit was filed on behalf of more than 40000 former gulf oil 
corp employees retirees and chevron employees who previously 
worked for gulf and their family members

oil prices rallied sharply monday on news that 
iraq will send another 250000 troops into kuwait 
light sweet crude oil the benchmark blend had dropped about 1 
a barrel in early trading on the new york mercantile exchange as 
traders focused on prospects of peace in the gulf 
but prices shot up after iraqi president saddam hussein 
announced the military buildup crude settled at 3150 per barrel 
for december delivery contracts up 172 
analysts said part of the runup occurred as traders who had 
sold oil on the speculattion prices would drop scrambled to buy it 
back when prices began strengthening a phenomenon known as 
shortcovering but the overall movement of oil prices was based on 
the iraqi mobilization of additional troops 
contracts for delivery in january were up 113 at 3072 and 
other months were mostly higher 
obviously the markets spooked a little bit by saddams 
comments said randall rothenberg a broker with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
the traders seem to be tied on to the last statement from 
iraq the next statements from washington and so forth said bob 
baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc no real 
fundamental change but theres a lot of emotions 
as oil rose so did contracts for refined petroleum products and 
natural gas 
wholesale home heating oil went up 234 cents to 8676 cents a 
gallon on december delivery contracts with later delivery months 
all moving higher 
wholesale unleaded gasoline was up 273 cents at 8036 cents a 
gallon for december delivery with later months all moving up 
natural gas contracts were all higher with december delivery up 
15 cents at 235 per 1000 cubic feet 
oil had opened 118 lower as it stayed briefly beneath 30 a 
barrel for nextmonth delivery crude had moved that low friday 
for the first time since oct 23 but it didnt take long monday 
for traders to push oil back above the 30 mark 
crude made an immediate reversal on the news of the iraqi 
troops the mood of the market stayed bullish for the rest of the 
session even though many traders doubt hostilities will break out 
in the gulf before president bush winds up his thanksgiving visit 
to the us troops in the saudi desert

sassy an often controversial magazine for 
teenage girls let the readers do it in the december issue 
sassys editors put out the call last summer for readers who 
would create their own issue and selected 81 people from among more 
than 10000 applicants the issue goes on sale tuesday 
every single little thing in this issue is totally 
readerproduced the magazine boasts on the latest cover which 
carries a photo of three readers 
led by designated editor summer lopez a 17yearold high school 
student from los gatos calif about 40 readers visited sassys 
office in a building overlooking times square this past august to 
select story ideas write and edit features and columns shoot 
photos lay out pages and devise catchy headlines 
the others selected for the assignment did their jobs from home 
i learned talking and writing like a teenager can be hard 
even if i am one myself wrote ms lopez in a signed column that 
leads the issue 
cover stories included eight teens who fought for their 
rights living with cokehead parents and why we dont like 
our bodies 
im real happy with it said the sassys editor in chief for 
the 11 other issues a year jane pratt they wrote a little older 
than we do a little straighter but the design is younger in 
some ways 
sassy was launched in march 1988 and has occasionally generated 
controversyhomosexuality and incest 
but the magazines editors said that boycotts mounted by 
religious groups over the content of the magazine have been 
resolved and they say advertising pages were up 53 percent this 
year compared with a year ago 
the december issue contained about 55 pages of ads in a 100page 
book 
its guaranteed circulation is 550000 and is scheduled to rise 
to 650000 next year but it still trails other magazines aimed at 
teen girls such as seventeen at 175 million teen at 11 million 
and ym at 1 million 
alx mironovich publisher of ym said he thinks the 
readerproduced issue was a gimmick to get attention from 
advertisers 
benefit by comparison the photography was poor the fashion 
layouts were not appealing the cover was amateurish i dont think 
this is what a consumer looks for in a magazine he said 
ms pratt on the other hand said the issue helped sassy 
editors better understand their readers and how to communicate with 
them 
intends to make regular features one is a comic strip the 
magazine intends to run one from different readers of every month 
but it also had some problems a fiction piece on the end of the 
world was dumped because it wasnt as good as the other stuff 
ms pratt said and some photographs were too dark because of poor 
lighting techniques 
nonetheless ms pratt said she intends to have another 
readerproduced issue next december we are the only magazine 
that could do this and make it work she said

record high cash prices for cattle prodded the futures market 
upward monday at the chicago mercantile exchange 
cash cattle reached a record 8250 cents a pound at kansas city 
and there was talk that buyers were paying 83 cents at some 
markets said charlie richardson of lindwaldock amp co in denver 
on other markets soybean and grain futures were mostly higher 
as were oil and gold 
while cattle futures followed an upward trend they were 
somewhat restrained by fears that cash prices might be too high and 
by uncertainty generated by the governments sevenstate 
cattleonfeed report released after the close 
that report showed the number of cattle on feed as of nov 1 
874 million head at the high end of what the market was 
expecting 
this may put a little pressure on the deferred months but 
maybe not too much pressure since futures prices are already so far 
under cash said richardson 
the runup in futures prices has been restrained because people 
keep expecting more fed cattle to come to market but it just 
hasnt happened he said 
live cattle futures settled 08 cent to 38 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 7932 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 10 cent to 40 cent higher with january at 8780 cents 
a pound live hogs were 12 cent lower to 22 cent higher with 
december at 5360 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 08 
cent to 143 cents higher with february at 7220 cents a pound 
grain traders at the chicago board of trade keenly aware of the 
food shortages in the soviet union and eastern europe are watching 
for signs that point toward increased exports 
strong commercial buying of grain and soybean futures last week 
gave some substance to rumors that a huge ussoviet grain pact 
was in the works said william biedermann research director of 
allendale inc of crystal lake ill 
prices edged upward again monday but with restraint 
the markets saying i hear you but i want to see it he 
said 
this is reflected in the cash market too where supplies are 
extremely tight because farmers are sitting on their harvests 
the farmers locked it up and threw the key away biedermann 
said they know that come springtime theyll be the only store 
in town 
wheat settled 1 cents to 2 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 252 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 
cents higher with december at 227 a bushel oats were cent to 
cent lower with december at 111 a bushel and soybeans were 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with november at 569 a bushel 
gold futures at the commodity exchange in new york responded to 
the fluctuations in the crude oil market but within a more narrow 
range 
the weekend offer by iraq to release western hostages sent oil 
futures into a decline on the opening but this softness was 
quickly overtaken by the unfolding events in the mideast and 
washington 
gold made its lows for the day on the opening but then the 
rhetoric rallied oil and then gold followed said bette 
raptopoulos metals analyst in new york with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
first came word that iraq plans on sending an additional 250000 
troops into kuwait followed by iraqs annoyance at the cold 
reception the bush administration gave to its hostagerelease 
offer 
gold settled 170 to 250 higher with december at 38230 a 
troy ounce silver was 9 cents to 10 cents lower with december at 
414 a troy ounce 
light sweet crude oil on the new york mercantile exchange 
settled 5 cents lower to 172 a barrel higher with the december 
contract at 3150 heating oil was 15 cent to 234 cents higher 
with december at 8676 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 
126 cents to 273 cents higher with december at 8036 cents a

the government could save 2741 billion in 
medical costs in the year 2000 by regulating fees and replacing 
private insurance companies with universal public coverage 
consumer groups said monday 
we can guarantee affordable highquality health care for all 
americans said ron pollack executive director of families usa 
foundation we can do it by controlling doctor and hospital costs 
and by cutting the red tape that really is the only thing the 
insurance companies produce 
the health insurance association of america an organization 
representing private insurers said the groups wanted to drum up 
support for health care funded and administered by the government 
such a system would lead to health care rationing which most 
americans will not accept and would cost an estimated 245 billion 
annually which most americans will not abide association 
spokesman donald b white said in a statement 
a report by families usa foundation and citizen action said the 
government should limit fee increases levied by doctors hospitals 
and other health care providers 
such controls similar to those now imposed in the medicare 
program would reduce from 86 percent to 66 percent the projected 
annual health care inflation rate and save 2457 billion 
nationwide by the year 2000 the report said 
doctors and hospitals could achieve the required savings without 
reducing quality by eliminating unnecessary treatment and holding 
down increases in providers income the report said unnecessary 
hightech equipment purchases and facility construction should be 
avoided it said 
replacing the nations 1500 private insurers with a single 
provider would save another 53 billion in the year 2000 the 
report said under a national system health care could be 
administered by the federal government the states or a 
quasipublic entity families usa foundation spokesman arnold 
bennett said 
youre getting rid of an industry that is pencil pushers 
bennett said 
the report said examples of the private insurers administrative 
waste include diverse and duplicative payment rules differing 
rates high advertising costs and excessive profits 
it estimated that providing medical insurance to all americans 
would require additional spending of 243 billion at the turn of 
the century 
high administrative costs are borne disproportionately by small 
businesses and individuals who must purchase their own coverage 
the report said for every dollar of health care costs paid by 
groups of one to four people 40 cents goes for administration 
groups of 100 to 150 pay 16 cents per dollar for administrative 
costs 
white the industry spokesman agreed that 25 to 30 percent of 
health care services in the united states are unnecessary but he 
described as ironic the criticism of administrative expenses which 
he said cover systems that clamp down on unnecessary spending and 
help make health insurance more affordable 
costs can best be controlled by giving private insurers more 
flexibility to cover smaller businesses and granting those 
businesses tax breaks so they can better afford group coverage 
white said also public coverage for the poor and nearpoor should 
be expanded he said 
the consumer groups said they calculated their figures using the 
latest available government statistics on private and public health 
care spending in each state and estimates of future spending based 
on age income and other demographic information

cbs inc said monday it expects to post a loss 
in the fourth quarter because of a weak advertising market and 
unexpectedly large losses on its television broadcasts of major 
league baseball 
the company also said it expects lower earnings from continuing 
operations for all of 1991 compared with this year 
the glum forecast comes as cbs reportedly planned a meeting with 
its affiliates board to propose a reduction in the estimated 160 
million the network pays about 200 affiliated stations for carrying 
its shows 
media analysts said they expected cbs would post a loss for the 
last three months of 1990 and an earnings decline in 1991 
analyst jeff russell of smith barney harris upham amp co said 
cbs would lose about 35 million in the quarter and earnings will 
fall to about 205 million in 1991 from about 230 million in 1990 
in reaction to the news cbs shares dropped 4 to close at 
15975 in trading of new york stock exchange issues 
cbs isnt the only media company suffering because of a slowdown 
this quarter in national ad spending growth 
capital citiesabc inc which operates the abc television 
network said last month as it reported a decline in profit in the 
third quarter that it expected a decline in earnings for the fourth 
quarter as well 
like cbs capital citiesabc has been hurt by losses on major 
league baseball coverage at its 80 percentowned espn cable tv 
network 
the third major network nbc is owned by general electric co 
which does not report separately on its broadcasting subsidiarys 
performance 
cbss unspecified loss projected for the fourth quarter would be 
its first excluding special items since the company lost 20 
million on continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 1986 
spokesman kewith fawcett said 
cbs earned 595 million or 231 a share in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 
this was the first year of cbss fouryear baseball contract 
which allows it to carry several regular season games along with 
the league championship series world series and allstar game 
while the network reportedly expected to lose about 35 million 
in the first year of the 106 billion contract the losses are 
said to have run much higher cbs sports president neal pilson has 
said only that the loss on baseball was under 100 million 
on monday cbs said losses on baseball were higher than 
anticipated as the result of soft demand in the ad marketplace 
for time on sports programs and because the world series and one of 
the two league championships were settled in four games instead of 
the maximum seven 
the short series meant cbs had fewer nights of baseball on which 
to sell advertising games later in a series also tend to draw 
bigger audiences making them more valuable to advertisers 
cbs said its tv network would have had a loss for the fourth 
quarter even without baseball because of the soft ad marketplace 
it said the marketplace weakness has dampened demand for 
network local tv and radio advertising and said network ad prices 
have been particulartly soft for national football league and 
primetime broadcasts where cbs ratings have improved 
in projecting a decline in earnings from continuing operations 
in 1991 compared with 1990 cbs cited the worsening economic 
climate for advertising and rising costs for entertainment programs 
and sports rights 
another reason is that the 1990 figures include profits on the 
coverage of the nfl super bowl and the national basketball 
association playoffs and championship that the network will not 
have rights to in 1991 
as a result the cbs television network is currently expected 
to show an operating loss in 1991 the statement said 
russell said his firm expects the cbs tv network will post a 
profit of about 10 million for 1990 and lose about 35 million 
next year

government policy makers must help bring down the 
cost of doing business in new england in order to turn around the 
regions slumping economy according to a report issued monday 
the report from bank of boston corp says some costs such as 
wages and housing will drop naturally as the economy continues its 
slide but government officials can assist in other areas where 
economic cycles play a smaller role such as health care costs and 
workers compensation 
two weeks after the election of four new governors in new 
england we want to point out that the current debate has yet to 
focus on the issue of the cost of doing business said wayne 
ayers chief economist for bank of boston who helped prepare the 
report 
so much attention during the election was understandably 
focused on fiscal problems he said but the state budget to 
any extent is a reflection of the underlying health of the 
economy 
ayers said high business costs not only threaten to further 
erode new englands shrinking manufacturing base but also could 
hurt the regions services sector 
he said the services sector cannot prosper when attorneys 
accountants and other vendors have nothing to service 
we need a core manufacturing base and therefore lowering the 
cost of doing business is critical he said 
according to the study 
housing prices although declining are still above the 
national average and make it difficult to recruit new workers to 
the region 
medical care costs have raised health insurance premiums in 
new england by 13 percent a year about 3 percentage points above 
the national average the effect has raised the cost of doing 
business in new england compared to the rest of the nation by 
about 1000 per employee per year 
workers compensation is more expensive in new england than 
elsewhere and the problem is worse today than at the height of the 
economic boom of the mid1980s 
ayers said the weak economy would take its toll on housing 
prices and wages 
as painful as the process is it is necessary for any kind of 
recovery he said 
ayers also said the regions business costs have been 
exacerbated by the persian gulf crisis which has increased higher 
oil prices and added to the high bills paid by companies 
despite the gloom the region has many strengths the report 
said including emerging technology companies a strong research 
and education base foreign trade and a skilled work force

the head of one of the worlds biggest futures 
exchanges is being sued for 3 million by an expartner for 
allegedly failing to repay money he borrowed to cover losses on 
commodities deals 
new york mercantile exchange chairman z lou guttmans losses 
mounted as he conducted trades in cotton copper sugar crude oil 
coffee cocoa and currencies according to the attorney for harold 
magid a futures trader who claims to have set up a joint venture 
with guttman in 1987 
guttman was losing money through his personal account which at 
times did not contain enough cash to meet the requirements of 
exchanges he was trading on so he borrowed money from the joint 
venture after promising it would be repaid lawyer neal schwarzfeld 
said monday 
guttman referred inquiries to his lawyer david yeres 
the allegations are bogus and contrived yeres said monday 
he said he plans to respond in detail through his own court filing 
magid and guttman became partners in the joint venture through 
which they would equally share profits and losses from futures 
trading according to magids lawsuit filed in state supreme court 
which is a triallevel court in new york 
their brokerage functions were performed by an entity known as 
harley futures inc which they jointly owned the lawsuit said 
they also hoped to share commissions and management fees from 
business they were able to generate for a separate trading firm 
gerald commodities inc the lawsuit said 
guttman was to supervise harleys business and use his status as 
chairman of the mercantile exchange to solicit additional business 
the lawsuit said 
the joint venture set up with 300000 deposited by guttman and 
magid immediately began turning a profit of 30000 to 40000 per 
month eventually it had made millions the lawsuit said 
but guttman began losing money through a personal account and 
magid agreed to let him borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars 
from the partnership the money was lent with the understanding 
that guttman would repay it but payments never came and eventually 
the joint venture fell so short of cash it had to liquidate many of 
its futures positions the lawsuit said 
after magid stopped doing business with guttman in august magid 
found that he was temporarily blackballed in the commodities 
trading community because of his dispute with guttman schwarzfeld 
alleged
