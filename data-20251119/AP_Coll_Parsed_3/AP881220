a judge has rejected the american civil 
liberties unions bid to join a lawsuit over the forced cancellation 
of the 1988 gay rodeo national championship effectively removing 
gay rights as an issue in the dispute 
in denying the aclus motion the judge determined the issue that 
has pitted conservative residents against homosexual organizers was 
not civil rights said churchill county district attorney kevin 
pasquale 
there was an effort to make this some kind of gay rights forum 
they wanted to turn this into a threering circus but it didnt 
work the judge said the aclu cant play pasquale said 
shelly chase executive director of the nevada aclu said her 
group was giving up despite the outcome of mondays hearing before 
district judge archie blake in fallon 
were still trying to come up with a way to get involved ms 
chase said we just have to prove that discrimination occurred 
that there was an effort to try to keep an unpopular group out by 
using laws that are too broadly applied 
the national gay rodeo championship was canceled in midoctober 
just days before its scheduled opening after blake signed a 
temporary injunction preventing the event from being held at a 
private fallon arena 
the 20acre stockmans arena was leased from owner david lantry 
after the international gay rodeo association had been turned away 
by public arenas in reno virginia city and fallon 
in granting the temporary injunction blake agreed with the 
county saying the health and safety of the community was at stake 
because of expected crowds of up to 1000 that would strain police 
and emergency services 
blake said the rodeo organizers also did not have the proper 
county license for the event 
the judges decision was upheld by the nevada supreme court 
which said the case did not raise questions of homosexual rights or 
freedom of expression 
county officials acted to halt the rodeo after about 50 fallon 
residents presented them with a petition signed by 1519 people who 
didnt want the event in their community 
the county is seeking a permanent injunction to block future 
rodeos on lantrys property because officials claim it is not large 
enough or properly equipped lantry with the help of aclu 
attorneys is fighting the permanent injunction 
blake set a may 1719 trial on the issue after denying 
aclubacked motions including one to move the case from fallon 
ms chase said appeals would likely follow and the gay rodeo 
association was expected to seek damages from the county for more 
than 20000 in losses because of the cancellation

presidentelect bush has made his appointments 
for the final two spots on the national economic commission but 
doubts persist over how successful the panel will be in breaking a 
sevenyear deadlock over the budget deficit 
the highlevel commission was created to help the new president 
deal with president reagans biggest economic failure huge budget 
deficits that have more than doubled the national debt 
on tuesday bush announced he was choosing former sen paul 
laxalt rnev and former ohio congressman thomas lud ashley a 
democrat and one of bushs closest friends 
under law bush was required to pick one democrat and one 
republican to complete the 14member commission which is headed by 
democrat robert strauss and republican drew lewis 
supporters once believed the bipartisan panel represented the 
best hope of breaking the impasse between reagans opposition to tax 
increases and the democratic congresss refusal to trim domestic 
spending enough to tame the budget deficit 
but even with the appointments many observers said the 
commission faces a nearly impossible task of reaching a consensus 
among panel members who have squabbled openly over such issues as 
taxes and the need to trim defense spending 
what bush has done is give the commission a renewed look of 
respectability but the members are a long way from reaching a 
consensus on a credible plan that bush and congress will accept 
said michael evans head of a washington consulting firm that bears 
his name 
the commission once had hoped to complete its work before 
christmas but lewis has said the panel may not issue its 
recommendations until next september 
at that time the panel could serve as an emergency vehicle which 
bush could use to throw together a compromise with congress in order 
to avoid automatic spending cuts under the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
but strauss said tuesday that he hoped the commission would try 
to meet a march 1 deadline specified in the law creating the panel 
the law did provide an escape clause that would allow the new 
president to delay the report until sept 1 
the commission has scheduled 16 days of hearings in january and 
february to begin making decisions on a deficitcutting plan even 
though those sessions have been clouded by a court battle over 
whether the commission can deliberate in secret 
during the campaign bush had derided the commission as a 
stalking horse for tax increases something he has pledged 
repeatedly he will not accept 
but in making his announcements tuesday he tempered his earlier 
skepticism noting that he had named ashley and laxalt one day after 
the electoral college ratified the nov 8 vote electing him 
president 
the swiftness with which i am making these appointments 
underscores the importance i place on the need to reduce the federal 
budget deficit bush said 
ashleys appointment had been expected but the choice of laxalt 
was a surprise and came after bush apparently rejected the advice of 
some aides that he select oklahoma gov henry bellmon who as a 
ranking republican on the senate budget committee in the 1970s had 
gained a reputation as a political pragmatist 
by picking laxalt over bellmon some observers said bush decided 
to go with more of a hardliner against taxes to insure that his 
nonewtax pledge is adhered to 
from everything i know about him he would be against taxes and 
would want to look on the spending side for deficit reductions 
said richard rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce 
rahn is a leading antitax supply sider who had been considered 
as a possible choice for the commission himself 
the other 12 members of the commission evenly split between 
democrats and republicans were appointed by congressional leaders 
and reagan 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass said bush made the appointments tuesday in order to reassure 
financial markets of his seriousness in cutting the budget deficit 
but he said it remains to be seen how seriously the presidentelect 
will take the panels findings 
the suspicion is that regardless of what the commission says 
bush will ignore it wyss said

freed 281 political prisoners throughout south korea on wednesday 
and restored the civil rights of 1581 others in a sweeping amnesty 
to restore political peace 
justice ministry officials said prison terms of 92 other 
political prisoners were reduced and 61 radical students were 
removed from police wanted lists 
the government ordered the amnesty involving 2015 of what it 
called politically motivated offenders as part of efforts to 
defuse a nationwide furor over demands that former president chun 
doohwan be punished for human rights abuses and corruption under 
his authoritarian regime 
roh appealed to the nation last month to forgive chun and 
promised to free political prisoners as part of a series of measures 
to wipe out vestiges of chuns government roh a former general and 
ally of chun has pledged to introduce full democracy 
dissident groups accused roh of betraying his promise to free all 
political prisoners and claimed about 300 remained in jail 
justice officials said 224 antistate criminals still were 
behind bars but said nearly all were communist north korean spies 
or dissidents convicted of violent crimes 
the main political opposition parties welcomed the amnesty they 
had frequently demanded such action as a way toward national 
reconciliation and democracy but said they would still press for 
action against chun 
among those released wednesday were kim hyunjang and moon 
booshik each was serving a 20year term for leading a raid on the 
us cultural center in pusan one person died and three were hurt 
when the center was set afire in the protest over us support for 
the chun government 
kim taekun a leading dissident who won the robert kennedy human 
rights award this year had his civil rights restored kim who was 
released last june drew five years in 1986 on charges of 
overthrowing the government and spreading pronorth korean 
propaganda 
kim claims he was forced to make a false confession under torture 
justice ministry officials said the amnesty was the second since 
roh succeeded chun last feb 25 and involved the largest number of 
political offenders in a single amnesty

the public has glimpsed the nightmarish world of 
domestic violence through hedda nussbaums testimony in the lisa 
steinberg case but experts say more than increased awareness is 
needed to save the lives of children like 6yearold lisa and now 
5yearold jessica cortez 
we were seeing five deaths a day nationally before lisa died 
and five deaths per day since then said dr richard krugman of 
the kempe national center for the prevention of child abuse and 
neglect in denver 
i cant blame the public i dont think the public knows what 
to do said krugman 
lisa steinberg made headlines when she died in november 1987 a 
symbol of a system gone wrong she made frontpage news again last 
week at the trial of joel steinberg the man she knew as daddy 
the man accused of murdering her 
but last wednesday when the brutal beating death in brooklyn of 
5yearold jessica cortez grabbed the headlines away it was the 
same old story only the name had changed 
jessica cortezs mother abigail and the mothers boyfriend 
adrian lopez were unemployed they lived in a cityowned housing 
project in brooklyn on the surface they had nothing in common with 
the steinberg family except that children in their home also were 
battered 
one day after police found lopez standing over jessicas limp 
body they returned to the apartment and found jessicas 9yearold 
halfbrother nicky lebron alvarez quivering in a closet badly 
beaten with 10 bones broken 
family court authorities charged monday that welfare officials 
knew that ms cortez had a history of child neglect but failed to 
tell a judge about it according to a published report the new york 
times said in tuesdays editions that during a 1986 custody hearing 
welfare officials called the woman a good mother even though the 
citys special services for children department had filed a neglect 
petition against her three years earlier 
ninetyfive percent of the american public knows child abuse 
exists thats not the issue anymore said krugman my 
impression is people make some cosmetic changes after rekindled 
awareness of child abuse its like firing a football coach when 
youve got bigger problem than just the coach 
now we need a new kind of public awareness that physical 
abuse of children the lisa steinberg type cases are preventable if 
people want to do something 
the national committee for the prevention of child abuse 
estimated there were 1132 childabuse fatalities in the united 
states last year krugman puts the figure at 2000 to 5000 
there were 225 million official reports of abused children 
nationally in 1987 including 25 percent who were physically abused 
and 14 percent who were sexually abused the committees report 
said jessica cortez fit into both those categories police said 
she also fit into a third category at least 103 children died of 
abuse last year in new york city 
authorities say those numbers arent likely to decline despite 
widespread publicity about child abuse and the steinberg case live 
national television coverage on cable news network a cover story in 
newsweek hours of local tv coverage of ms nussbaums testimony 
but it will have some positive effect they believe 
the steinberg case puts the spotlight on the topic said 
detective joseph ryan coordinator of domestic violence programs for 
the new york city police this case is very important because it 
is that much more detailed and serves to show the dynamics of 
violence in a family situation 
agreed carol digirolamo executive director of the governors 
commission on domestic violence there clearly is some increase in 
awareness 
the deaths of steinberg and jessica also illustrated one of the 
more frightening aspects of child abuse it crosses all lines of 
race economics and geography and domestic violence is rarely 
limited to just one family member experts in the field say 
steinberg was a lawyer ms nussbaum his livein lover was a 
childrens book editor they lived a comfortable existence in a 
historic building in manhattans upscale greenwich village and 
authorities said their two illegally adopted children were 
illtreated 
when lisa was found in a coma nov 2 1987 the other child 
mitchell was sitting in a dirty diaper tethered to a chair and 
drinking spoiled milk ms nussbaum also had been badly battered 
in both the steinberg and cortez cases drugs were apparently 
involved another disturbing trend which has contributed to the 
rising number of child abuse cases 
ms nussbaum has detailed how she and steinberg freebased cocaine 
while lisa lay unconscious in another room neighbors of lopez and 
ms cortez said they were also drug users smoking marijuana and 
crack 
from july 1 1987 to june 30 1988 the city human resources 
administration estimated 14 percent of its 55286 reported abuse 
cases were tied to drugs a 67 percent jump from the previous 12 
months

in the days before newspapers had the ability 
to print photographs special artists were dispatched to great 
national events including presidential inaugurals to record the 
event on sketch pads 
that era is recalled in these days before the inauguration of 
george bush as the nations 41st president in a small capitol 
exhibit 
it displays the views that artists for harpers weekly 
frank leslies illustrated news and other publications provided 
of the inauguration of every president from 1853 to 1905 
entitled hail to the chief the exhibit also recalls the 
circumstances that gave each of those ceremonies its own flavor 
an 1853 sketch shows presidentelect franklin pierce and outgoing 
president millard fillmore striding through the capitol rotunda on 
the way to the inaugural platform on the east front the traditional 
site of inaugurals until president reagan took the oath of office on 
the west front in 1981 
pierces vice president william king was sworn in by the us 
counsel in havana the only president or vice presidentelect ever 
to take the oath of office outside the united states 
convalescing from a serious illness king died six weeks later 
pierce objected on religious grounds from swearing his oath he 
exercised an option permitted him by the constitution and affirmed 
it instead he is the only president to have done that 
the drawing of james buchanans inauguration in 1857 shows the 
scaffolding and hoists being used to build the new senate wing of 
the capitol 
by the time abraham lincoln was inaugurated four years later the 
new high dome of the capitol is shown half completed by the time of 
lincolns second inauguration in 1865 the dome is complete crowned 
with the statue of armed freedom on top 
an 1861 illustration shows lincoln and buchanan en route to the 
capitol in an open carriage passing a shop sign reading great 
book sale 
the exhibits text recalls that when lincoln reached the 
inaugural stand he could not find a place to put his hallmark 
stove pipe hat 
stephen douglas lincolns unsuccessful rival for the presidency 
reached out his hand for it 
if i cannot be president at least i can hold his hat he 
said 
in 1869 the nations preeminent war hero gen ulysses s grant 
was sworn in as president and his predecessor andrew johnson broke 
a precedent 
insulted by grants refusal to accompany him on the traditional 
ride down pennsylvania avenue johnson refused to take part in the 
inaugural ceremonies 
the general served two scandalplagued terms and the 1877 
inaugural drawing shows him looking on as rutherford b hayes takes 
the oath 
hayes a republican had lost the popular vote to democrat samuel 
j tilden but some electoral college votes were in dispute 
the issue was settled by a special commission and the nod went to 
hayes 
since march 4 the date of presidential inaugurations in that 
era fell on a sunday that year the ceremonies were postponed until 
monday march 5 
but to ensure that the nation not be without a president hayes 
took the oath secretly on march 3 in the red room of the white house 
james a garfield was inaugurated in 1881 and for the first time 
women were front and center on the inaugural platform moving from 
the seats in the rear traditionally reserved for them his wife 
mother and the wife of president hayes all sat in the front row 
when garfield completed the presidential oath he turned and 
kissed his mother the first mother ever to see her son inaugurated 
as president 
beginning the first of two nonconsecutive terms in 1885 grover 
cleveland took the oath on a family bible inscribed to sg 
cleveland it had been given to him by his mother before he dropped 
his given name stephen 
the illustration for the benjamin harrison inauguration in 1889 
shows harrison taking the oath surrounded by a sea of umbrellas 
officials had wanted to move the ceremonies in out of the rain but 
the presidentelect overruled them 
the year 1889 was also the centennial of the inauguration of the 
first president george washington harrison made the most of the 
celebration playing the role of washington at several events in new 
york city 
if he cares to george bush can follow suit in 1989 the 
bicentennial of washingtons inauguration 
the artist who depicted william mckinleys inauguration in 1897 
shows spectators viewing the scene from the roof of the newly 
completed library of congress 
in 1905 theodore roosevelts rough riders gathered to ride in 
roosevelts inaugural parade 
but they ran into a problem there werent enough cavalry horses 
for them to ride so they used horses borrowed from the horse 
artillery which were accustomed to hauling cannons not passengers 
the horses didnt follow orders and the exhibit text notes 
the rough riders literally lived up to their name 
at the ceremonies roosevelt wore a ring containing a lock of 
abraham lincolns hair loaned to him for the occasion by secretary 
of state john hay who had served as lincolns white house secretary 
by that time the era of the special artist was nearly over 
the era of the press photographer was about to begin

a west virginia elector who says the nation has 
outgrown the electoral college provided the only surprise during 
the constitutional ritual officially electing george bush as the 
nations 41st president 
margarette leach switched her democratic ballot voting for 
lloyd bentsen for president and michael dukakis for vice president 
as she and 537 other electors carried out their constitutional duty 
otherwise all voted as pledged to give bush and republican 
running mate dan quayle each 426 electoral votes far more than the 
270 needed for election over dukakis and bentsen the switched 
ballot gave dukakis one vote fewer than the 112 presidential 
electors he earned in winning 10 states and the district of columbia 
i did it for a reason and the reason was to make a statement 
about the electoral college said leach a huntington wva 
nurse it was fine then when it began but weve outgrown it 
for example leach said she and the 269 other female electors 
could have put a woman in as president if they hadnt wanted to 
vote for the nominated candidates 
i wish i had voted for kitty dukakis now she said 
the electoral college vote set the stage for another 
suspensefree ceremony on jan 4 when a joint session of congress 
meets and bush as vice president is to open the sealed ballots and 
formally declare himself the presidentelect 
although other electors voted as expected many agreed with leach 
about the antiquated but constitutionally required electoral college 
system devised by the founding fathers two centuries ago 
nevada elector eileen schouweiller called it silly and 
archaic 
however she added i suspect it will be with us for a long 
time to come 
after casting their votes for dukakis and bentsen wisconsins 11 
electors voted 92 to pass along some unsolicited advice to congress 
in the form of a resolution urging the electoral college be scrapped 
the system is fatally flawed said elector lawrence longley 
we should not be in a position to decide upon who should be 
president it should be decided most appropriately by the american 
people 
although the constitution does not require electors to vote as 
their states voters directed there have been few deviations over 
two centuries of elections before leachs change there had been 
only eight faithless electors 
democratic electors in new york and minnesota and a republican 
in texas didnt carry through with suggestions that they might cast 
symbolic votes for another candidate for president or vice president 
i have reservations about mr quayle said texas elector 
william f spivey jr but our president bush who i do not have 
reservations about has seen fit to choose him so im going to go 
with what he says i should have abstained probably 
some states carried out brief ceremonies steeped in history 
while others made a party of the event still others got the 
formalities of voting and papersigning over within 10 minutes 
dukakis governor of massachusetts telephoned electors pledged 
to him in iowa and addressed a ceremonial gathering of his electors 
in the statehouse in boston 
im sorry im not here in another capacity dukakis said 
but i want you to know theres nothing that compares to running 
for the presidency of the united states 
i wish the presidentelect well he added but i also know 
there were some things we were fighting about in the campaign that 
are going to be there on january 20th and theyre important 
bush and quayle will be sworn into office jan 20 
many electors said they had received mail from people urging them 
to deny quayle his election as vice president some said they 
werent enthusiastic about quayle but they werent buying the idea 
of dumping him 
i love george bush and im very enthusiastic about that but 
im not real happy with the selection of quayle said elector 
tommy thomas a former florida state republican chairman who voted 
for quayle anyway 
i think the process should be changed and i hope it will be 
changed he said 
among the other electors who voted for bush and quayle were 
bushs brother prescott s bush jr in connecticut bushs son neil 
bush in colorado his designated white house chief of staff gov 
john sununu of new hampshire and penn state football coach joe 
paterno a bush campaign supporter

nasa is laying the groundwork to send the next 
generation of astronauts beyond the earths orbit early in the 21st 
century with missions to mars and a space station on a martian moon 
among the possibilities 
in a report released monday the national aeronautics and space 
administration said the nation must make a modest investment of 
resources during the 1990s to prepare the nation for a range of 
opportunities in space 
this ability is critical to united states leadership in 
space said the report titled beyond earths boundaries human 
exploration of the solar system in the 21st century 
the report examined several strategies for exploring the inner 
reaches of the solar system including establishing a manned lunar 
observatory setting up a space station on the martian moon phobos 
or sending astronauts to the red planet itself early in the next 
century 
the ambitious blueprint addresses president reagans directive on 
space policy issued last january the directive sets as a longrange 
goal to expand human presence and activity beyond earth orbit into 
the solar system 
frank martin assistant administrator of nasas office of 
exploration said theres every indication the bush 
administration will support that policy 
the underpinnings of any strategy to send space explorers to the 
moon and beyond in the next two decades will be increased nasa 
funding for development of new technology life sciences research 
unmanned robotic missions development of a new fleet of launch 
vehicles able to lift heavier loads and continued commitment to 
space station freedom which is planned for earth orbit in the 
mid1990s 
if those conditions are met the united states could send 
astronauts to phobos in 2003 or to mars in 2007 or establish by 2005 
a lunar base from which astronauts could build a mars outpost in 
2015 said john aaron who headed the office of exploration during 
production of the report 
aaron said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates 
for the missions studied in the report we are not talking about 
missions that are cheap he said but we think these are 
affordable 
martin said such missions probably could be accomplished at less 
real cost than the apollo program which put us astronauts on the 
moon in 1969 at its height the apollo program cost about 4 percent 
of the federal budget annually which in todays dollars would be 
about 25 billion he said 
you cant do the civil space program on the cheap he said 
noting the nation now spends about 11 billion annually on nasa 
programs the fiscal 1989 federal budget is about 11 trillion 
were not a poor nation we can figure out how to do these 
things if theyre important to us he said adding that 
international cooperation could help support these missions 
martin said nasa must leap many technological hurdles before it 
can accomplish the goal of establishing a permanent human presence 
in space but i dont see any show stoppers there 
nasas project pathfinder under whose umbrella much of the 
research will be done gets 40 million this year and the same 
amount next year despite nasas request for 100 million martin 
said annual funding for the program must increase to 100 million 
soon 
the report focused on four case studies for sending astronauts to 
the moon phobos and mars one scenario would send astronauts to 
phobos and then on to mars another would launch astronauts directly 
to mars a third would establish a manned observatory on the far 
side of the moon and a fourth would use an outpost on the moon as a 
stepping stone to mars 
aaron who is now special assistant to the director at johnson 
space center emphasized that the four case studies are not proposed 
missions but rather vehicles for assessing exploration techniques 
and validating assumptions 
a key finding aaron said is that a mission to phobos could 
significantly offset the scale and uncertainties of a direct mission 
to mars 
an earthtomars mission would require many new technologies 
including advanced propulsion and braking systems and would require 
advanced operations such as inorbit assembly longterm storage and 
inorbit transfer of propellant much work in the life sciences also 
would be needed and because the mission would last more than 14 
months artificial gravity might be needed to maintain the health of 
the crew the report said 
phobos is believed to be an asteroid captured by mars 
gravity and is thought to contain a substantial amount of water and 
carbonbased materials which could offer potential sources of 
rocket fuel that could be tapped for exploratory missions to mars 
phobos is an attractive way to go to mars martin said i 
would be surprised if phobos isnt a part of the us going to 
mars

at night the brightest light 
shining in this south america city of 10 million is cast by the moon 
spotlights on public monuments the flashing neon glare of 
billboards lights in office towers store windows and even on a 
christmas tree near a main thoroughfare have been turned down or 
even off by government order 
there is an electricity shortage 
streetlights have been dimmed by 50 percent drivers who usually 
careen along narrow often cobblestone streets downtown with only 
their cars parking lights have taken to turning on low beams 
the problem stems from seasonally low levels of water in the 
uruguay limay and neuquen rivers that feed hydroelectric stations 
and the shutdown for repairs or maintenance of argentinas two 
nuclear power plants 
the system is working at the limit of its capacity and we 
should be prepared for whatever eventuality and are running the risk 
of a total outage said daniel larriqueta a spokesman for the 
interior ministry 
portenos as residents of this port city are called have had to 
make do with rotating scheduled outages of five hours a day since 
last week 
city residents have become accustomed to summertime electricity 
shortages as the city has grown faster than its public services can 
handle blackouts which have occurred half a dozen times since 
1965 are relatively rare however the last occurred in november 
1985 
the latest scheduled outages have meant walking up flights of 
stairs for lack of working elevators sweating in late spring heat 
for lack of air conditioning and dodging four five and sometimes 
six lanes of cars at rush hour for lack of functioning traffic 
signals 
beginning today the hours of the three governmentcontrolled 
television stations in this capital city will be cut back to 12 
hours noon to midnight the two private stations have been 
requested by the government to do likewise 
the usual hours of operation are 7 am to 3 am 
nighttime events like horseracing at the hipodromo and concerts 
have been canceled until further notice unless the facility has its 
own source of electricity soccer games usually played at night to 
avoid daytime heat have been rescheduled for the afternoon 
at the huge salto grande hydroelectric complex on the uruguay 
river north of the capital only one of 14 turbines was operating 
tuesday the rest were idled by lack of water 
the atucha nuclear power plant about 60 miles north of buenos 
aires has been shut down since august for repairs to its cooling 
system the embalse station 465 miles to the west of the capital 
is undergoing routine maintenance 
about three weeks ago the government for the first time in years 
ordered clocks to be set back one hour to take advantage of the 
extra daylight 
the time change will stay in effect at least until jan 15 when 
one of the nuclear plants should be back on line said eduardo 
cohen director of planning at the the ministry of public works 
energy secretariat water levels probably wont rise until seasonal 
rains return in may he said 
on the lighter side energy restrictions will be lifted the 
following two weekends for christmas and new years a government 
spokesman said

the race for chairman of the national democratic party with support 
from ohios two us senators but without the backing of his states 
top two democratic party officials 
stanton scheduled a news conference today to make his bid 
official 
he has won the support of sens john glenn and howard metzenbaum 
but ohio democratic chairman james ruvulo and vice chair thea boyd 
on monday lined up behind another candidate michigan democratic 
chairman richard wiener 
wiener was among the first to announce his candidacy for the job 
being vacated by paul kirk 
wiener on monday announced the support of 13 other state party 
leaders from the midwest they include the state party chairs from 
north dakota minnesota kansas south dakota illinois wisconsin 
nebraska and indiana as well as vice chairs from several states 
stanton said hes confident democratic national committee members 
who examine his background will be convinced hes right for the job 
ive built a ward organization ive run a city council ive 
run an 800 million business stanton said monday i have the 
communications skills to talk to the people who are going to 
financially energize any political party in this country 
i believe i have a very viable chance to win stanton said 
stantons decision followed a lengthy testingthewaters period 
ive been very much encouraged by people i respect deeply 
people like former dnc chairman bob strauss and others stanton

of congress from ohio as well as the rev jesse jacksons 1984 
campaign manager gerald austin and jacksons 1988 campaign

a consent decree may be reached by the end of 
the week for the cleanup of a federally owned uranium enrichment 
plant in ohio a us energy department official says 
an agreement to clean up the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant 
near piketon in southern ohio was announced last month by ohio gov 
richard celeste and state attorney general anthony j celebrezze jr 
however the plan still was under review by the energy department 
on monday spokesman douglas g elmets said 
a senior department official who asked that he not be 
identified said the energy department may have a decision by the 
end of the week on a consent decree that would involve court 
supervision of a cleanup 
when celeste and celebrezze announced the 50 million cleanup 
plan last month they said it was significant because the federal 
agency would be bound by state law and regulation 
the piketon plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial 
nuclear power reactors it generates toxic wastes such as 
polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs solvents and metals as well as 
radioactive materials 
when the agreement was announced nov 22 celeste said he hoped 
it would serve as a model for other tough cleanup cases such as the 
governmentowned fernald plant near cincinnati environmental 
officials say that plant has dumped radioactive waste improperly 
possibly contaminating ground water since it began processing 
uranium for nuclear weapons in 1951 
the piketon plan calls for the energy department to be subject to 
orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency which 
would supervise the cleanup of about 6 million pounds of waste last 
month officials said the agreement still needed to be incorporated 
into a federal court consent decree

federal regulators are proposing the creation 
of a new agency possibly drawing money from banks credit unions 
and savings institutions to oversee the clean up of the 
moneylosing savings and loan industry 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 
3000 sampls on monday sent the broad outlines of the proposal to the 
treasury department which is formulating the incoming bush 
administrations plans for dealing with hundreds of insolvent 
savings institutions agency spokesman karl hoyle said 
bank board chairman m danny wall in a speech to a group called 
the national housing conference proposed what he called a 
reinsurance agency for all federally insured financial 
institutions 
on an unrelated topic wall also said the bank board is offering 
to make foreclosed properties from failed savings institutions 
available to house the homeless in a half dozen cities 
the bank boards insurance fund the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp has been paying for a record number of sampl rescues 
this year primarily through promissory notes pledging future income 
from an assessment on stilloperating institutions 
wall has argued previously that the fees paid by sampls to the 
fslic as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurance 
funds were meant to cover a normal level of failures not the 
catastrophic level of the current thrift crisis 
through monday regulators said they have resolved the cases of 
159 insolvent thrifts this year more than 400 insolvent sampls remain 
open and hundreds of others are close to insolvency 
the reinsurance agency would oversee three insurance funds for 
banks sampls and credit unions it could collect premiums from all 
three spending them when one of the funds got in trouble it also 
could serve as the mechanism for further borrowing to pay for the 
thrift crisis or as the conduit for any money congress wanted to 
spend on the cleanup 
bank board member lawrence white in an interview said the 
proposal leaves open who will pay for the sampl cleanup and whether a 
new agencys expenditures would be counted toward the budget deficit 
i dont think it is intended to be a back door way of getting 
them banks and credit unions to pay for the fslics current 
problems white said the concept is both a funding mechanism 
and a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs in 
the future 
meanwhile the new york times reported in weekend editions that 
the reagan administration in its 1990 budget will acknowledge for 
the first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the thrift 
industry problem 
an administration source who declined to be named told the 
associated press that the treasury department estimates the cost of 
restoring the thrift industry to health at 60 billion to 75 
billion if interest rates remain unchanged and as high as 105 
billion if interest rates increase by two percentage points the 
figures were first reported by the washington post 
regarding the proposal to use sampl properties for the homeless 
hoyle said the bank board is talking with six or seven cities in 
texas and in the north and midwest he declined to identify them 
hoyle said the bank board would lend the properties in some 
cases commercial buildings near soup kitchens to municipal 
governments which in turn would pay to administer them as temporary 
shelters 
that ball is in their court at this juncture they have to 
decide if they have the funds he said we would like to get it 
done in the winter when this housing would be most useful to the 
homeless 
discussions with the cities started several months ago hoyle 
said another effort to persuade private groups to purchase 
foreclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poor 
families began about a year ago he said 
wall disclosed the homeless initiative on the same day that 
presidentelect bush in announcing the appointment of rep jack 
kemp rny as secretary of housing and urban development said 
his administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem of 
homelessness

large airlines at four major airports would 
have to prove they make heavy use of their takeoff and landing slots 
or risk losing them to other carriers under a proposed federal rule 
change 
the proposal released monday by the federal aviation 
administration would revise the high density rule at chicago 
ohare international laguardia and kennedy international in new 
york and washington national 
the rule adopted in 1969 limits the number of takeoff and 
landing slots at the airports during heavy traffic periods 
currently airlines must show that they are using those slots during 
65 percent of the heavy traffic hours over a twomonth period 
the new proposal would require large air carriers with 10 or more 
slots to show that the slots are being used at a 90 percent rate or 
the faa would consider withdrawing them the requirement would be 80 
percent for carriers with five to nine slots and would stay at 65 
percent for all others 
the slots that are taken away from an airline could then be 
available for sale or reallocation to a different airline the faa 
said 
the change would increase opportunity for new entrant carriers 
to have access to highdensity airports and for small incumbent 
carriers to increase the number of operations at those airports 
the faa said in a statement 
american airlines spokesman al becker said his company was 
encouraged that the faa wanted to make sure the takeoff and 
landing slots are fully utilized 
were using every single slot we have becker said at some 
airports we obviously could use more he said that in some cases 
airlines have held their slots without fully using them 
the limits on takeoff and landing slots are necessary because an 
airports air traffic control system has limited capacity becker 
said 
we are not in favor of any slot program at all if it can be 
avoided becker said but eliminating the system would require 
costly expansion of the air traffic control systems 
the faa is seeking public and aircraft industry comments on its 
proposal

the government is levying almost 15 million 
in fines against 25 companies for failing to meet a new deadline for 
reporting chemical emissions 
almost half the penalties would be accounted for by one plant 
inland steel cos works at east chicago ind which was accused by 
the environmental protection agency of not reporting emissions of 33 
different substances ranging from aluminum to xylene 
inlands proposed fine was set at 721000 spokesman bob lefley 
said monday we reported except we reported late after the 
july 1 deadline 
since this is the countrys secondlargest steel plant it was 
a monumental task lefley declined further comment 
the law requiring reports of emissions was passed in 1986 in 
response to the bhopal disaster in india two years earlier in which 
more than 2000 people were killed by escaping methyl isocyanate a 
gas used in making pesticides 
companies in a broad swath of industrial categories are required 
among other things to report releases to air water and land of 320 
hazardous or toxic chemicals or chemical families epa forms were 
supposed to have been filled out and filed with both epa and state 
authorities 
all 25 plants proposed for fines were checked by inspectors from 
epas regional offices and penalties were chosen to reflect the 
size of the company the number of chemicals that should have been 
reported the quantities released and the amount being used epa 
said 
were not talking about a major enforcement action here said 
bill walsh of the us public interest research group an advocacy 
organization that has kept track of developments in the field 
there are 15000 to 16000 companies that epa knows of that have 
not filled out the forms out of 30000 that were obliged to 
epa spokeswoman alicia tenuta said she could not confirm walshs 
figures however she said investigators were finding that of 
companies they looked at roughly onethird had not complied fully 
with the reporting requirements 
epa could have imposed fines of 25000 per day the companies 
have 20 days to notify epa whether they want to pay the fine to try 
to negotiate a lower fine or to contest the fine before an 
administrative law judge 
here are the companies and locations of the affected plants 
along with the plants principal product or line of business the 
chemicals whose emissions should have been reported and the fines 
the agency did not say how much of each chemical was involved

morris siegel is homeless wealthy and 
unwilling to change even though his health may someday force him to 
use the 190000 estate he inherited from his parents in 1979 
the 71yearold recently agreed to claim the inheritance which 
has grown to 207421 but said he has no intention of changing his 
lifestyle 
for the last 20 years siegel has lived in alleys or boarding 
rooms he likes his lifestyle and has no use for money the former 
cab driver said during a street corner interview last week 
i dont want it when youre young the money means 
something he said refusing a lengthy interview or photographs 
if he did have money he said he would just lose it to thieves 
siegel said he has known about the money since his father died in 
1979 he claimed it only because of pressure from relatives he said 
siegels father a blacksmith named sam left the estate to his 
son said kenneth landon of the state controllers office in los 
angeles 
when the inheritance went unclaimed the account was turned over 
to the county public administrators office then to the state said 
daniel zingale a special assistant to the state controller in the 
division of unclaimed property 
zingale said siegels cousin mildred weitzman contacted him in 
september 1987 asking for help in her efforts to get siegel to claim 
the money 
siegel was uninterested but more than a year later he did sign 
documents zingale said landon said the money will probably be 
deposited in to an account in siegels name 
last week doctors at ucla medical center told siegel he had a 
heart condition and other medical problems said mayor lachman 
another of siegels cousins 
living on the streets he could be harassed and pressured for 
money and he was scared lachman said he was never really 
interested in the money because he wants to live a different kind of 
lifestyle 
living on the street thats his greatest desire i want him 
to live a little better a little easier he said

pat paquin says shes been amazed by an 
outpouring of support since her husband was nearly electrocuted 
trying to help an accident victim a neighbor plows her driveway and 
a merchant dropped off a christmas tree 
somebody else brought us our wood and people have been 
stacking our wood she said every couple of days ill come home 
from the hospital and dinner will be on the doorstep 
on nov 25 ed paquin ran into downed electrical wires while 
rushing to aid the driver of a truck that struck a utility pole in 
shaftsbury in southwest vermont as his family watched from their 
vehicle 7200 volts of electricity pulsed through paquins body 
his sister alice revived him and rescue crews delivered him to 
the albany ny medical center partially paralyzed with serious 
internal injuries and burns on his neck and knees 
today paquin 35 is in fair condition and recovering slowly at 
the medical center hospital of vermont in burlington he receives 
burn treatment and therapy and his 7yearold daughter catherine 
reads to him the other day he reached a milestone he moved his 
legs 
im glad to be alive but its really hard not to know how much 
and how long its going to take to recover he said last week 
im really lucky that people in my town and other people 
around they just have been really good and supportive and 
everything he said tears in his eyes when asked what keeps him 
going 
it gives you some faith when you feel people have faith in you 
and thats the way people have been making me feel 
paquin is a selfemployed carpenter and member of the rescue 
squad in his hometown of fairfax a small town 15 miles northeast of 
burlington one of his friends dan stoddard of nearby huntington 
described him as full of fun and life 
hes a musician hes always the life of the party hed bring 
his banjo or guitar the unfortunate part of the accident he cant 
move his hands at all but that may just be a matter of therapy 
stoddard said 
friends said it was just like him to rush to the aid of an 
accident victim 
thats why he was on the rescue squad in the first place his 
wife said we saw the accident and i was just thinking 
were supposed to be someplace and i remember him saying 
something about he didnt see any rescue vehicles and he thought he 
could do something its not something i could do 
ironically the driver of the truck apparently picked his way 
through the live wires and left the scene moments before the paquins 
drove by according to police and witnesses 
michael hulbert of bennington pleaded innocent monday to charges 
of leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended 
license a court clerk said he was released on his own recognizance 
pending an appearance sometime next month 
pat paquin a parttime freelance journalist said the most 
difficult days were the ones right after the accident 
its so hard to explain to anyone who hasnt gone through it 
the constant fear youll get a call from the hospital and something 
will be wrong she said 
in the last week or so after staying with relatives while her 
husband was in albany she returned home and was greeted by the 
generosity of neighbors and friends one changed the tires on her 
car the fairfax rescue squad has begun a fundraising campaign to 
help defray the couples expenses 
he has survived something no one thought he should have 
survived everybody thinks its a miracle she said

a mailorder catalog firm that has 
begun catering to the captive audience of prisoners reports 
christmas sales are on the rise 
they are very good customers and its developed into a 
substantial segment of our business where else are they going to 
go said mortimer polep chairman of the holyokebased paysaver 
catalog showrooms inc 
we even got a thankyou letter from one inmate who said after 
all our money is as good as the guy that hasnt been caught yet 
he said 
paul hahn of the 2000member national mail order association 
based in los angeles said its impossible to tell how many inmates 
order from catalogs but sales seem to be up everywhere 
we dont keep any special statistics on sales to prison 
inmates but my sense is that they have been increasing as prisons 
have eased the regulations on what kinds of packages prisoners can 
receive he said 
polep said his companys christmas sales to prisoners are up 25 
percent this year but he wont divulge exactly how big his business 
is behind bars 
at the 1100inmate state prison at norfolk sgt christopher 
cameron said he inspects about 30 packages a day that inmates have 
ordered from catalogs we dont allow them anything like hacksaws 
or shotguns he said 
for the three weeks before christmas however the prison 
suspends its rules against mailed food and allows inmates to receive 
packages up to 25 pounds holding mailorder and homemade delicacies 
to inspect the food packages the prison must hold up inspections 
of other packages which wait until after christmas to reach inmates 
the food is more important and meaningful to them anyway 
cameron said they can get clothes all year 
the largest purveyors to the norfolk prisoners are cook brothers 
an illinoisbased catalog firm specializing in lowcost items 
followed by service merchandise of nashville tenn and 
merchandising giants jc penney co and sears roebuck and co 
cameron said 
clothing is the big sales item at the mediumsecurity prison 
followed by towels television sets radios and fans he said 
weve put together a little booklet on what they can order but 
essentially its any basic necessity cameron said they know by 
word of mouth that if there were any problems with anyone trying to 
bring in weapons or drugs we would cut back on the orders and we 
can trace it right back to who is responsible 
payments are made by the prison against inmate accounts he said 
they build up accounts by working in prison or by getting money 
from their families 
regulations on what prisoners can order vary widely from state to 
state and prison to prison according to state and federal 
officials with federal prisoners allowed only limited 
catalogordering privileges 
they have to have special prior permission but half the time 
the issue is not so much the regulations but the fact that our 
inmates just dont have the money said kathryn johnson a 
spokeswoman for the federal bureau of prisons 
sears treats its prison customers just like any others said 
spokeswoman kathy gucfa except that it delivers packages directly 
to the prisons rather than to its retail stores obviously they 
cant get out to pick up their packages she said 
but paysaver has employees assigned just to its prison business 
and christmas is a particularly busy time 
the woman in charge of the companys prison sales who asked that 
her name not be used said some of her dealings with inmates have 
helped restore my faith in human nature 
sometimes they dont figure the shipping charges right and if 
its just a couple of dollars i send it out and just tuck a note 
inside as to what is owed and almost always i get a check back 
she said 
i got a letter from a man at attica in new york who said he 
was sending christmas presents to his kids in florida and asked if i 
could put a note inside the package saying with love from 
daddy

insurance companies claimed a major 
victory after a jury decided shell oil co would have to spend up to 
2 billion to clean up three decades of pesticide pollution at the 
rocky mountain arsenal in colorado 
the verdict was a clean straight win for the insurers said 
barry bunshoft an attorney for lloyds of london the british 
insurance market that had faced the biggest share of possible 
liability to say that this is an exciting win and a gratifying 
win is an understatement 
the 250 insurance companies involved convinced a jury they should 
not be held responsible for the contamination because shell knew of 
the pollution for 30 years they claimed shell was not covered by 
its 800 different policies any more than a homeowner who set fire to 
his own home 
naturally were extremely disappointed with the outcome of 
this lengthy trial said betty lynn mcham a shell spokeswoman in 
houston we believe there are sound legal grounds for appealing to 
a higher court and we will appeal 
in 1983 the justice department ordered the oil company to pay 
the cleanup bill then estimated at 18 billion shell subsequently 
began trying to collect the money from its insurers 
dozens of insurance company attorneys whooped for joy monday when 
the verdict was read in san mateo county superior court the lengthy 
trial was held in a makeshift courtroom at crestmoor high school to 
make room for all the lawyers 
eleven jurors voted for the insurance companies for the period 
from 195259 with one juror against for the period 196082 the 
vote was 11 for the insurers and one undecided a jury in a civil 
suit does not have to reach a unanimous verdict 
the jurors declined to comment on their decision 
during those years shell leased the us army land at the 
arsenal north of denvers stapleton international airport for a 
pesticide production plant the soil and groundwater at the plant 
was polluted by shell and army operations and the pollution seeped 
into nearby drinking water wells 
shell attorneys also argued before judge william lanam that the 
liability should be mainly with the army because it provided the 
leaking pipes and ponds used by the oil company 
regardless of the outcome of this litigation the citizens of 
colorado can be confident that shell has and will continue to meet 
its share of responsibilities at the rocky mountain arsenal we are 
hopeful that the remaining issues between the state of colorado the 
us army and shell can be resolved thereby allowing the arsenal 
cleanup to proceed expeditiously ms mcham said 
the trial which began in october 1987 was held in san mateo 
county because of the countys record of completing cases promptly 
it included more than 4000 exhibits and hundreds of hours of 
testimony 
ms mcham said she could not estimate the cost of the cleanup 
insurance industry sources put it at 2 billion

the soviet unions leading educator says the 
countrys youth should no longer be taught by rote that teachers 
now recognize that individual thinking should be cultivated not 
plowed under 
gennady a yagodin chairman of the state education committee 
says students will be allowed to choose elective courses and 
teachers will be able to teach oncebanned classics of 20th century 
russian literature under reforms being considered at a national 
education conference this week 
he did not specify which novels might be permitted to sway young 
minds but some of the masterworks rehabilitated in recent years 
include boris pasternaks doctor zhivago and mikhail bulgakovs 
master and margarita 
forcing every student to fit the same mold which was long the 
soviet educational norm fails to encourage greatness yagodin 
acknowledged 
the teacher hits the nail on the head to keep it from 
sticking out but this does great damage to the individual he told 
a news conference monday 
president mikhail s gorbachev repeatedly has said changes in 
teaching methods and in the nations curriculum are necessary to 
guarantee that his drive for social and economic reform is a success 
we pin hopes for the future largely on the work of our school 
which is only natural with its own teaching talents and the 
creative pursuits of the soviet teacher gorbachev told the 
communist partys policymaking central committee in february at a 
special meeting devoted to school reform 
yagodin raised the startling possibility that the new core 
curriculum might not include mathematics considered abroad to be a 
forte of soviet education but that seemed to be his personal 
desire rather than a pending policy 
how many here can compute the square root of 174 he asked an 
auditorium full of soviet and foreign reporters none of whom 
answered does happiness depend on this he asked 
he suggested the core curriculum should include language study 
and literature science and history 
this weeks conference in moscow will choose the core curriculum 
and the electives to be offered at higher two levels yagodin said 
the first stage of schooling will last three or four years 
depending on the aptitude of the students and they will have to 
pass a test to move up because if a student poorly reads and 
counts when he moves on it builds in problems for the future he 
said 
in the higher grades students will spend less time on literary 
criticism and more time reading actual literature yagodin said 
we have students who can tell you leo tolstoys mistakes but 
they have never read war and peace he said 
more literature from foreign countries and the nonrussian 
nationalities of the soviet union will be added to the curriculum 
he said 
more soviet students will be going abroad in exchange programs as 
well he said already the 2500 young people attending classes 
outside their homeland is three times the number in 1985 he said

in 1899 two local businessmen went to 
atlanta and acquired the first rights to bottle and distribute 
cocacola for 1 
thats how the worlds first coke bottling plant wound up in this 
southeastern tennessee city and thats why a retired cocacola 
executive wants to open a museum devoted to the popular soft drink 
sebert brewer jr heads a group thats working on plans for the 
coke plant a proposed 3 million to 5 million hightech museum 
near the citys riverfront 
we want to show the stages that cocacola bottling went through 
from the beginning of the bottles all the way to the cans and the 
talking machines all the ways it has reflected changes in the 
american life said sandy wagner a boston consultant helping plan 
the project 
ideally the museum would be housed in the old downtown cocacola 
bottling plant which now serves as headquarters for the hamilton 
county board of education 
the museum would have a permanent collection of cocacola 
memorabilia show traveling exhibits from cocacola co archives in 
atlanta and give audiovisual presentations on coke history 
marketing and technology 
financing for the museum is still up in the air brewer said but 
the group will probably seek some assistance from local and state 
governments and private donations 
last month cocacola announced plans to build a 10 million 
fourstory museum in atlanta called the world of cocacola to 
chronicle the history of the 102yearold soft drink company that 
project is scheduled to open in 1990 
the coke plant would not be sponsored by the atlanta 
conglomerate but brewer said coke officials have expressed support 
and he believes theres room for two attractions 
were extremely optimistic we can pull it off he said

soviet officials say the immense cost of raising 
new cities from the rubble of the armenian earthquake will slow 
mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to achieve social and economic 
reforms 
deputy prime minister yuri batalin told reporters in the armenian 
capital of yerevan on monday that housing construction will begin 
next month in the cities and villages destroyed in the dec 7 quake 
tass reported 
the new buildings will be significantly more resistant to seismic 
activity than those that collapsed in the quake the official news 
agency quoted him as saying 
the quake which measured 69 on the richter scale leveled the 
cities of leninakan kirovakan and spitak as well as up to 100 
villages and left more than 500000 people homeless 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who heads a politburo 
commission overseeing relief efforts was quoted by tass as saying 
reconstruction will cost much more than the 83 billion originally 
estimated 
he called the destruction enormous and said the disaster and 
relief effort dealt a palpable blow to the national economy and 
gorbachevs campaign for change tass reported 
the cost of rebuilding will affect the implementation of the 
social programs being carried out in the course of economic reform 
in the ussr ryzhkov said 
leninakan and kirovakan will be rebuilt on the same sites while 
spitak will be shifted to a spot where there is less danger of 
another earthquake according to ryzhkov new buildings will not 
exceed three to four stories 
almost every building of more than five stories collapsed in the 
quake and officials all the way up to gorbachev have criticized 
shoddy construction they say contributed to a death toll in the tens 
of thousands 
the communist party daily pravda estimated monday that 
4000045000 people were killed in the quake at least 10000 fewer 
than an earlier toll of 55000 given by soviet officials 
ryzhkov announced that a government commission was formed to 
investigate technical violations in the construction of highrise 
apartments and other buildings in an area of seismic danger 
since the quake thousands of people have been living in tents or 
in the open air and the onset of winter in the caucasus mountains 
of the southern soviet union has dealt survivors and rescue workers 
alike one more hardship 
snow and freezing temperatures again were forecast for armenia 
today the spitak mountain range near the quake zone already is 
capped with snow 
moscow radio said evacuation of children women and the elderly 
from the earthquake zone was nearing completion within days pravda 
said only men involved in rebuilding the area should remain 
batalin told the politburo commission overseeing relief efforts 
that 70094 people have been evacuated from the quake zone and that 
33053 have been relocated to holiday resorts 
the bodies of thousands of people still buried in the rubble pose 
the threat of epidemic and radio moscow said survivors in the area 
were given medicine to make them more resistant to infectious 
diseases 
no survivors have been found since saturday but there has been 
no official announcement of an end to the search 
because of the staggering damage done by the quake all houses 
factories and farms have to be built anew radio moscow said 
vi chernovanov deputy chairman of the soviet agriculture 
committee said preliminary estimates show it will cost 5 billion 
just to rebuild wrecked farm buildings barns and other rural 
facilities 
gennady a yagodin the governments top education official told 
reporters that practically all the schools were destroyed 
including a leninakan polytechnical institute that collapsed 
killing 1000 students and teachers 
children must be sent to other areas because the quake wiped out 
380 educational institutions from preschools to technical 
institutes he said 
mother teresa the 1979 nobel peace prize laureate on monday 
offered the soviets the assistance of her religious order the 
missionaries of charity which operates orphanages hospitals and 
schools in more than 25 countries 
tass did not say whether the soviets agreed to accept mother 
theresas offer in the past religious groups have been barred from 
engaging in public assistance or operating hospitals schools and 
other social services

rescue workers crawled four miles into a cave 
in southwest missouri before finding two teenagers who were 
stranded during an outing the day before authorities said 
the 16yearold boys were reported missing to the stone county 
sheriffs department after they didnt return home from a sunday 
afternoon outing at salt peter cave near galena 25 miles southwest 
of springfield 
the names of the boys were not released 
the parents went to the mouth of the cave sunday evening and 
located a pair of socks and shoes belonging to one of the boys 
one of the boys father and a friend apparently went in the 
cave hoping to find them a sheriffs spokesman said when they 
started having trouble with their lights the father sent the friend 
out to get help but the father stayed in there 
it took the ozark mountain cave search and rescue team about two 
hours to find all three they were all out of the cave by about 3 
am monday 
they were tired cold wet and dirty but they were all ok 
the sheriffs spokesman said 
the rescuers traveled about four miles before finding the boys 
it doesnt sound like much except when you consider we were 
bellycrawling through 58degree water most of the way four miles 
is a long way said bruce herschend who led the rescue squad 
many places were so tight our backs and bellies were scraping at 
the same time 
the boys apparently started having trouble with their flashlights 
during the expedition he said they knew they didnt have enough 
light to lead them out of the cave so they found a dry place and 
waited for help

the government says it will amend the internal 
security act next month to bar courts from challenging its right to 
jail people without charge or trial for up to two years 
the planned amendment is the result of a dec 8 appellate court 
ruling that released on a technicality four people detained under 
the security law on monday the government rejected the court move 
and the four were rearrested 
if singapore courts review ministerial discretion in security 
matters singapore judges will in effect become responsible and 
answerable for decisions affecting the security of singapore this 
was not and is not the intention of the legislature as expressed in 
the isa the government statement said 
courts have been guided by a 1969 precedent that said detention 
cases were outside their purview the amendment will legally 
entrench this precedent 
under the internal security act the government may imprison for 
up to two years any citizen who in the opinion of the home affairs 
minister poses a danger to national security or public order 
detention orders can be renewed indefinitely 
the dec 8 decision involved the arrests of lawyer teo soh lung 
39 social worker kevin de souza 27 dramatist wong souk yee 29 
and teacher chng suan tze 39 chng had seven months to serve on his 
original detention order and the others six months each 
they were among 21 people first detained in mid1987 on charges 
of trying to undermine the government as part of a clandestine 
communist network 
the judges reviewing their case said in a 107page verdict that 
the judiciary could review the cases of detainees held under the 
security act 
in rejecting the verdict the government said parliament next 
month will revise the internal security act with retroactive effect 
to say court have no right of review the governing peoples action 
party controls 80 of the 81 seats in parliament

hundreds of people wailed and called 
down a curse on the government and a shipping line today in 
emotional ceremonies marking the first anniversary of historys 
worst peacetime disaster at sea 
the 300 protesters were marking the dec 20 1987 sinking of the 
ferry dona paz and the oil tanker vector which collided and 
exploded off mindoro island leaving more than 3000 people dead 
in the name of all our loved ones wherever they are we swear 
that all those responsible shall be made to pay for the deaths and 
injustices they caused the crowd chanted in unison we will not 
lose hope until all those responsible are punished 
a presidential commission said at least 3563 people were aboard 
the two ships but only 26 survived survivors and relatives claim 
the government and the dona pazs owners sulpicio shipping lines 
have not provided adequate compensation nor taken steps to prevent 
other maritime disasters 
the protesters including at least four survivors and relatives 
of dona paz victims assembled at a manilas church for a mass then 
marched toward president corazon aquinos office at malacanang 
palace 
about 20 police officers and vehicles blocked the marchers at a 
bridge about 600 feet from the palace but permitted the marchers to 
hold a rally 
after speeches the protesters lit candles and set fire to 
papiermache models of the two ships two men slit the throats of 
two chickens and spattered the models with the blood 
as the flames triggered firecrackers inside the models hundreds 
wailed and began reciting the curse traditional among people of the 
central visayas islands from where most of the victims came 
during the rally survivor arnel galang told the crowd that the 
sulpicio lines had offered him money to testify that the oil tanker 
was at fault but he refused 
they think they can buy lives with their money he said he 
said the survivors were being victimized by owners and this 
uncaring government 
speaker ildefonso aresala who said he lost his entire family in 
the disaster said his claims for compensation had been bogged down 
by paperwork 
i thought the president would be able to help but i was 
mistaken he said theres no clear solution this is very 
painful for us i dont know what kind of law we have 
other relatives of victims claimed the government was simply 
pressuring them into accepting inadequate compensation offered by 
the ship owners 
for as long as the government adopts a system that favors the 
interests of greedy capitalists corruption will continue endlessly 
and sea travelers will never be safe said one leaflet distributed 
in the crowd 
nazzer cajolo who claimed he lost five brothers in the disaster 
said sulpicio offered a 7500 settlement but his family rejected it 
now they say my brothers are alive he added we want this 
government to listen to us and not avoid us 
cajolo is one of about 300 people who have filed a class suit 
against sulpicio lines the largest philippine domestic shipping 
company the suit was rejected by a lower court but an appeal is 
pending 
in october another sulpicio passenger ship the dona marilyn 
sank during typhoon ruby with about 500 people aboard about half 
those aboard died or are missing

eighteen candidates will vie for the mayors 
office but the failure of exmayor jane byrne and another former 
democratic powerhouse to go after the republican nomination leaves 
the gop without a bigname contender 
mrs byrne a democrat in the citys top post from 1979 to 1983 
sent word through her daughter to waiting reporters at the board of 
elections on monday that she would not pursue the republican 
nomination as had been rumored 
jane byrne is not a candidate merry christmas kathy byrne 
told reporters then departed 
edward vrdolyak a former cook county democratic chairman turned 
republican who also was said to be considering a bid sent an aide 
to tell reporters minutes before mondays filing deadline for 
nomination petitions that he too is not interested 
seven democrats and 11 republicans filed petitions to appear on 
the ballot in the feb 28 primary election the april 4 general 
election will decide who will complete the remaining two years of 
the late mayor harold washingtons fouryear term independent 
candidates have until midjanuary to file 
on the democratic side mayor eugene sawyer named to the post by 
the city council after washington died of a heart attack in november 
1987 will square off against cook county states attorney richard 
m daley son of the legendary mayor richard j daley and alderman 
timothy evans 
sawyer and evans who are black are battling to represent the 
black community although daley also has begun campaigning hard for 
the black vote chicago is slightly more than 40 percent white 40 
percent black 15 percent hispanic and less than 5 percent of other 
races 
other democratic candidates are aldermen lawrence bloom and juan 
soliz former state sen james taylor and sheila a jones a 
follower of political extremist lyndon larouche 
no republican has been elected mayor since william hale big 
bill thompson left office in 1931 but a white republican made a 
strong showing against washington in 1983 when washington became 
the citys first black mayor 
mrs byrne was derailed in her 1983 reelection bid when she and 
daley split the white vote allowing washington to take the 
democratic nomination 
the decisions by mrs byrne and vrdolyak not to run was a 
disappointment for gop leaders party slatemakers had passed over 
all the other candidates who appeared before them at a recent 
meeting to leave the door open for vrdolyak 
cook county republican chairman james dvorak said he had been 
told ms byrne was likely to enter the race and he had expressed 
support for a vrdolyak bid calling him the best potential candidate 
and a man of vision 
leaders in the republican party urged me to consider a 
candidacy and i did so as a courtesy to my party vrdolyak told 
reporters through an aide instead i will concentrate my time and 
energy on my law practice and on assisting to build the republican 
party in chicago and cook county 
the most prominent name in the republican field is dr herbert 
sohn a physicianlawyer who three times unsuccessfully challenged 
longtime us rep sidney yates dill 
i was interviewed on channel 11 wttwtv this evening and the 
newsmen called me the republican frontrunner sohn said in a 
telephone interview late monday they even said i was way ahead of 
all the other candidates i couldnt believe it 
sohns primary opponents include kenneth r hurst who filed an 
unsuccessful lawsuit to try to get the election put off until 1991 
and john j holowinski a former democrat employed by the citys 
department of economic development

its community development department one black community 
development department official was fired another resigned one 
retired and one was reassigned because of alleged mismanagment of

an airindia boeing 747 flew to london 
without a single passenger after a sixhour delay prompted ticket 
holders to switch to another flight an airline spokesman said today 
we have no control on the passengers when the plane was 
delayed they opted for another flight said ks mahatre chief 
public relations officer of the staterun airline

booked on mondays flight from bombay switched to another airindia 
plane that stopped in london and continued on to new york mahatre

passenger mahatre said when contacted by telephone at the 
airlines headquarters in bombay

14member crew and 34 tons of cargo it cost the airline 54000 to

the government today announced an 
amnesty for more than 2000 politically motivated offenders 
including two who were serving 20year sentences for burning a us 
government building 
the justice ministry said the clemency was approved at a special 
cabinet session 
ministry officials said 281 prisoners would be released 
wednesday including kim hyunjang and moon booshik who were 
serving 20year sentences for leading a raid on the us cultural 
center in the southern city of pusan in early 1982 
protesters set fire to the building to protest us support for 
the government of thenpresident chun doohwan one person was 
killed and three were wounded 
another 1581 people already freed on parole will have their 
civil rights restored wednesday 92 prisoners will have their 
sentences reduced and 61 people who were sought by police will be 
taken off the wanted list authorities said 
among those who will be granted restoration of civil rights is 
prominent dissident kim kuntae who was freed from prison in june 
he received the robert f kennedy award for human rights in april 
kim was sentenced to five years in prison in 1986 for inciting 
unrest but supporters alleged he was forced to confess by police 
torture 
prime minister kang younghoon said in a statement that the 
leniency was a bold step intended to heal the depressing wounds of 
the past era and thus to promote democratization 
he said the action was taken through consultations with all major 
political parties as had been promised by president roh taewoo 
roh pledged on nov 26 to release many political prisoners and 
institute other reforms to dissociate himself from chun his 
predecessor 
the main opposition party for peace and democracy said the 
government amnesty was an important step toward democratization but 
party officials said there were still 60 more political prisoners to 
be freed 
the reunification democratic party another opposition group 
welcomed the measure but dissident groups charged that roh betrayed 
his promise for a total release of political prisoners by excluding 
about 300 political prisoners mostly involved in movements for 
workers and depressed people 
government officials disagreed and claimed the figure was about 
200 who were involved mostly in communist spy cases and other 
antistate activities

a former executive pleaded guilty today to attempted 
bribery in the only case to come to criminal trial so far in a 
widening scandal over transactions in his companys stock involving 
leading politicians and businessmen 
hiroshi matsubara former chief aide to the president of 
recruitcosmos co admitted trying to bribe an opposition lawmaker 
who was investigating his companys role in the scandal 
i admit all charges they are all factual kyodo news service 
quoted matsubara as telling the tokyo district court i deeply 
regret my action and decided to accept charges in order to make a 
new start in my life 
he also reiterated his earlier statement that he was acting on 
his own and that recruitcosmos a real estate subsidiary of recruit 
co had no part in the attemted bribery recruit is an information 
service conglomerate 
it was all done by myself and the money came from my own 
savings and loans from my friends kyodo quoted him as saying 
the tokyo public prosecutors office arrested matsubara on oct 20 
for allegedly trying to give a 40320 bribe to parliament member 
yanosuke narazaki the leading investigator of the scandal 
narazaki of the opposition united social democratic party filed 
a complaint with prosecutors saying he had been offered the cash in 
exchange for toning down his investigations and questioning in 
parliament 
the prosecution charged today that matsubara acted out of fear 
that narazakis investigation might damage recruitcosmos as well as 
people who bought unlisted shares and then profited when public 
trading of the stock began 
the scandal has led to the resignation of several goverment 
officials and business leaders including finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa and hisashi shinto chairman of nippon telegraph and 
telephone co 
the transactions in the unlisted recruitcosmos shares were legal 
under japanese law but questions of ethics were raised against 
politicians and public officials who took advantage of their 
influence to earn handsome profits 
the case also highlighted a traditionally intimate link between 
politicians and business circles in japan 
public anger in the wake of the scandal led prime minister noboru 
takeshita to set up a committee to study possible revision of laws 
regulating political fundraising activities 
another controversy erupted over narazaki allowing a television 
camera into his residence to record the bribery offer nippon 
television broadcasting network broadcast the tape on an evening 
news program 
following narazakis complaint prosecutors confiscated the tape 
from nippon television as evidence the company fiercely protested 
the action saying it interfered with freedom of the press 
narazaki could face up to three years in prison on the bribery 
charge

soviet officials have received more foreign aid 
shipments than they can handle and donors should focus instead on 
sending money for rehabilitation of earthquake victims red cross 
officials said 
they called monday for suspension of aid shipments to armenia 
until further notice there have been about 140 foreign relief 
flights 
twothirds of 27000 rail cars that carried relief material to 
the earthquakestricken region have yet to be unloaded said per 
stenbaeck secretarygeneral of the league of red cross and red 
crescent societies 
another league official andrei kisselev said that due to a lack 
of international coordination the donor response has been far too 
generous 
i think there are more kidney dialysis machines per capita in 
armenia than anywhere in the world kisselev said citing news 
reports that said up to 75 machines were sent to the soviet union 
while only 20 were requested 
they briefed reporters after returning from a twoday trip to 
yerevan to check on the relief operations for victims from the dec 
7 earthquake 
we shouldnt send more supplies stenbaeck said and when i 
hear that dog teams were sent on saturday or sunday i must 
protest he said the soviets will have to return some of the 
donations 
international donations should focus on money for rehabilitation 
particularly workshops to manufacture artificial limbs stenbaeck 
said orthopedic centers are needed for 4000 people who lost limbs 
according to stenbaeck 
officials in armenia however are evaluating whether winter 
tents and additional transportation are still needed he said about 
53000 tents are in the area according to soviet figures quoted by 
the league 
stenbaeck said he met with soviet prime minister nikolai i 
ryzhkov and they agreed that stronger coordination between 
governments and private organizations is needed to ensure an 
efficient emergency program 
ryzhkov also realized there is a need for rather thorough 
changes in the disaster response system in the soviet union 
stenbaeck said 
nobody has overall view of what has been sent off stenbaeck 
said of the global effort it took a week to find out what has 
been stored in warehouses 
the league an arm of the international red cross combines 147 
national societies and musters worldwide relief in case of disasters 
in ankara turkey the soviet embassy issued a list of 
construction material needed for rebuilding the list included 
ceramic tiles washstands and tubs for kitchens and bathrooms

for two 1977 concerts canceled because of his death can get refunds 
soon the state director of unclaimed property said 
presley who died on aug 16 1977 at his home in memphis was 
scheduled for hometown performances on aug 27 and 28 
many of the fans who bought tickets for those shows for 1250 
to 15 each have never gotten their money back and it has been held 
in a savings account said darrell may director of the midsouth 
coliseum 
the unclaimed ticket money which originally totaled 150000 
has grown with interest to some 411000 may said 
in 1982 the presley estate and the promoters of the concerts 
filed suit to get the money but a state court of appeals ruled last 
week that ticket holders have first crack at it 
susan clayton director of the states division of unclaimed 
property said ticket holders will probably be allowed to keep them 
once presenting them to claim refunds

the release of a woman jailed for refusing 
to disclose the whereabouts of her son was blocked when us supreme 
court chief justice william rehnquist stayed a maryland court of 
appeals order 
acting at the request of the state attorney generals office 
rehnquist stayed the appelate ruling monday pending a response from 
jacqueline bouknights attorneys by noon wednesday said supreme 
court spokeswoman toni house 
marylands highest court had ruled 52 earlier monday that 
circuit judge david b mitchell violated ms bouknights 
constitutional protection against selfincrimination by sending her 
to jail 
mitchell found ms bouknight 21 guilty of contempt for refusing 
to tell social workers last april where they could find her 
27monthold son maurice she has remained in jail sine then 
the department of social services put the child in foster care 
after he was admitted to a hospital on jan 23 1987 at the age of 
three months with a broken leg and several partially healed 
fractures 
the department returned the child to ms bouknight the following 
august when she agreed not to physically punish the boy and to 
undergo training in how to be a parent 
last april the department filed a petition saying the child had 
not been seen since september 1987 and that ms bouknight had 
refused to disclose his whereabouts the petition also said the 
boys father had been shot to death and that ms bouknight had a 
history of drug abuse 
the appeals courts majority opinion by chief judge robert murphy 
noted that prosecutors fear maurice is dead or has been abused 
the state readily acknowledges that bouknights risk of 
incriminating herself is a substantial one encompassing among 
other possible crimes the felony of child abuse and even murder 
murphy said adding that the court cant ignore her constitutional 
protection against selfincrimination 
a dissenting opinion by judges james mcauliffe and lawrence 
rodowsky rejected the notion that she would be incriminating herself 
by revealing her sons whereabouts 
the states brief in the case argued that the importance of 
protecting the child outweighed ms bouknights right not to 
incriminate herself

the widow of prime minister olof palme 
the only witness to her husbands assassination identified the 
killer from a videotape last week a newspaper reported today 
the account by lisbet palme was the main evidence that persuaded 
a stockholm district court to order that christer pettersson 41 be 
held in custody friday said the report by the aftonbladet newspaper 
prosecutors police and petterssons defense attorney refused 
comment on the report prosecutor jorgen almblad complained that 
publicity about the case could put mrs palmes life in danger 
swedish television also reported monday that mrs palme had 
identified the gunman but it gave no details 
palme who was prime minister for 11 years was gunned down on a 
downtown stockholm street while walking home from a movie with his 
wife the night of feb 28 1986 mrs palme was grazed by a second 
bullet 
aftonbladet said two other witnesses identified pettersson as the 
man seen loitering outside the grand theater before the killing 
pettersson pleaded innocent at his arraignment but the court 
found the prosecution had shown reasonable grounds for suspicion 
he committed the murder 
defense attorney arne liljeros has indicated he will argue 
against the reliability of eyewitness accounts after a nearly 
threeyear time lapse failure to find the murder weapon a 357 
magnum revolver also could complicate the prosecution news reports 
said 
pettersson who has a long record of violent crimes and a history 
of drug and alcohol abuse was picked up wednesday after nearly a 
threeyear manhunt 
aftonbladet said mrs palme was reluctant to go through with the 
identification and relive the shooting but was persuaded by people 
outside the investigation to see a videotape 
mrs palme has persistently refused to publicly discuss the hunt 
for her husbands killer

are the target of a massive anticorruption campaign to remove their 
fingers from the public till the nations leading newspaper 
reported today 
in all 7200 officials 56 of whom were described as 
highranking government officials have been punished in the 
campaign the peoples daily said of these 1100 officials have 
had their cases referred to the nations courts for criminal 
prosecution it said 
in one case an engineer in the ministry of railroads gave a 
foreign business classified documents about chinas technological 
needs in return he was able to send his children to study in 
japan according to the report 
in another case 71 workers at an aluminum factory took 14 trips 
to the united states france italy and japan to research a single 
deal in all they spent 216000 of government money on the trips 
the newspaper said 
in reality it was pure jobbery using public funds for a 
tourist trip the paper said 
on sunday the paper reported that 30000 inspectors were working 
in 3000 officies nationwide to fight chinese corruption in dealing 
with foreign companies 
in all 17 million foreign trade contracts involving 150 
billion have been examined by officials the paper said 
since the campaign began in june 1987 investigators have opened 
15600 cases of which 7500 have been solved the paper said 
in its work concerning foreign trade china has some major weak 
links and loopholes the peoples daily said there really do 
exist some corrupt officials doing international trade politically 
and economically they create a very bad impression 
corruption is one of the major problems china faces as it 
attempts to open its economy to the west western companies wishing 
to do business in china are often forced by corrupt officials to pay 
bribes or offer gifts just for the chance to do business with 
beijing 
internal corruption in china has also been blamed for causing 
price rises illegal companies often set up by sons and daughters 
of powerful officials buy goods at wholesale rates and sell them 
for a profit increasing the goods price 
chinas inflation hovers at about 20 percent to 30 percent the 
highest since the revolution in 1949

pope john paul ii today appointed berlin 
cardinal joachim meisner to head the roman catholic archdiocese of 
cologne in west germany one of the most influential church posts in 
europe 
the appointment ended a 15month standoff between the vatican and 
clerics in cologne 
meisner was reportedly long backed by the pope but had been 
opposed by some clerics in cologne who are given a say in the 
selection process under a 1929 agreement between the vatican and the 
state of prussia 
reports from germany said some cologne churchmen viewed meisner 
as too conservative several west german politicians also spoke out 
against the pope insisting on his man 
however last friday the clerics of the 16member cologne chapter 
elected meisner clearing the way for tuesdays vatican announcement 
meisner who will be 55 on christmas lives in east berlin but is 
bishop of both sides of the divided city he has served as berlin 
bishop since april 1980 and was promoted to cardinal by john paul 
three years later 
the cologne archbishops post has been vacant since cardinal 
joseph hoeffner retired in september 1987 he died one month later 
the vatican announcement gave no hint of the controversy 
surrounding the nomination it noted however that the appointment 
was made in conformity with the 1929 agreement 
on dec 10 the vatican made a rare public statement about an 
archbishops appointment declaring that the pope had the right to 
name the cologne prelate even if the local church was opposed to his 
choice 
cologne is considered particularly influential because its 
archbishop has traditionally headed the west german bishops 
conference the roman catholic church in west germany wields 
considerable influence at the vatican and is the major financial 
contributor after the united states

george and ira gershwin michael jackson cole porter and gilbert 
and sullivan according to the new york times 
warner chappell is a division of warner communications inc

kind of use 
happy birthday generates about 1 million a year in royalty 
fees 
royalties were paid for example when the song was used in the 
films 10the great santinioh god and fame 
happy birthday to you was based on a melody composed in the 
1890s by two kindergarten teachers in louisville ky the songs 
lyrics were written later and the song was not copyrighted until 
1935 when the copyright expires in 2010 warner will no longer be 
entitled to royalties

more than half a million children died in 
16 developing nations last year because their debtburdened 
governments have had to cut back on social spending unicef said 
today in its annual report 
unicef executive director james p grant called for a world 
summit to save an estimated 3 million children who he said die each 
year from easily preventable diseases 
formally releasing the report during a worldwide telecast he 
said leaders of industrialized and developing nations should 
participate in the summit 
grant said cuts in social spending have led to problems that 
overshadow substantial progress made by most developing nations in 
health and education in the past decade 
three million children died last year because they didnt have 
50 cents worth of vaccine in them grant told a televised news 
conference relayed to 40 countries he said 15 million of these 
deaths occurred in south asia 
grant said he proposed the summit because the way to reach the 
victims is to first reach their leaders 
in the unicef annual report the state of the worlds children 
1989 grant cited the debts incurred by developing nations and 
said by far the heaviest consequences are being borne by the 
children 
throughout most of africa and much of latin america average 
incomes have fallen by 10 percent to 25 percent in the 1980s the 
report says in the 37 poorest nations per capita spending on 
health has dropped by 50 percent and on education by 25 percent over 
the last few years it adds 
children are facing the worst of times and potentially the best 
of times it is the worst of times because 35 years of progress is 
being threatened by falling commodity prices mismanagement and the 
debt crisis grant told reporters in new delhi before releasing 
the report 
a country can do incredible things with a small amount of money 
as long as the economy holds together when a countrys economy 
starts having trouble the children are always the ones who will 
suffer the most he said 
ten deeply indebted latin american and caribbean nations and six 
in africa have experienced a slowing down in the reduction of 
mortality in children under age 5 from 1980 to 1987 compared with 
the 1970s 
for these 16 countries alone the number of child deaths in the 
last 12 months is approximately 650000 more than would have been 
the case if the 197080 rate of decline in underfive mortality had 
continued said grant 
he said the majority of these deaths are related to the slowing 
down or reversal of the development process during the 1980s which 
is a result of unprecedented borrowing rising interest rates 
falling commodity prices inadequate investment of borrowed funds 
and the domestic and international management of the resulting debt 
crisis 
according to the unicef report the developing world is now 
transferring 20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it 
receives in new aid and loans developing nations owe an estimated 
12 trillion to private banks development funds and other 
countries 
at the beginning of the 1980s less than 5 percent of the third 
worlds children were immunized and diseases such as whooping cough 
measles and tetanus killed up to 5 million children annually the 
report says 
now more than half the developing worlds children are immunized 
and vaccines save the lives of about 15 million of them each year 
grant reports 
a new unicef goal is the immunization of pregnant women against 
tetanus which extends protection to their newborns the report says 
just 25 percent of them are now immunized and tetanus kills more 
than 800000 infants annually 
in 1980 the world health organization launched a campaign to 
reduce the death rate from dehydration caused by diarrhea which 
then claimed the lives of 4 million children annually 
by promoting the use of inexpensive oral rehydration salts a 
simple method for preventing almost all dehydration deaths 112 
nations now are saving the lives of up to 1 million children 
annually the report says

the top trade official in the soviet government 
today denied the ruble will be devalued by 50 percent in 1990 as 
had been widely assumed in the west from soviet media reports in the 
past two weeks 
the newspaper articles starting with one in sovietskaya 
industria or soviet industry had said the ruble exchange rate 
would fall by 50 percent on trade deals starting jan 1 1990 
western economists and businessmen assumed this meant a drop from 
the current governmentdecreed exchange rate of 160 per ruble to 
80 cents per ruble 
but that applies only to the rubles value in domestic deals 
among soviet enterprises not to its value in trade with foreigners 
vladimir kamentsev deputy chairman of the council of ministers and 
head of the state foreign economic commission told a press briefing 
this should not be taken as a change in the ruble standard 
versus foreign currency kamentsev said 
he said the 50 percent change applies only to exchanges of 
foreign currency between various soviet businesses governmentowned 
and cooperative 
a western diplomat who declined to be named noted at the time 
of the original report that it did not say which exchange rate would 
drop a critical distinction as the soviet union reputedly has 3000 
different exchange rates for different products and different 
trading partners kamentsev refused to clarify that question 
kamentsev said however that the current change is one step in 
the direction of a ruble that someday will be freely convertible to 
foreign currency he declined to name a date for convertibility but 
said it would come after a major price reform 
rubles now are virtually worthless outside the soviet union the 
soviet government sells rubles to tourists and businessmen at a rate 
of 160 per ruble but the black market rate is 25 to 30 cents per 
ruble 
kamentsev also said that starting next year soviet enterprises 
will be allowed to trade their foreign currency with other soviet 
businesses in a thriceyearly currency auction however he did not 
explain how the apparently open prices of an auction would coexist 
with a set rate

the soviet and japanese foreign ministers held 
heated talks today over a territorial dispute but made no progress 
and japan rebuffed soviet feelers on increased economic cooperation 
a foreign ministry spokesman said 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his counterpart 
sousuke uno were to give separate news conferences wednesday before 
shevardnadze leaves for the philippines and officials of the two 
countries were drafting a jiong communique 
but it appeared unlikely that progress could be realized on the 
major issue blocking improved relations soviet possession of the 
kuril islands off northern japan that tokyo insists should be 
returned 
the only positive sign was a possibility that the two countries 
would agree to continue talks at the official level on the dispute 
which dates back to world war ii 
neither side has shown concessions so the positions are still 
far apart seiichi kondo a japanese foreign ministry spokesman 
told reporters in a review of two days of talks between the two 
foreign ministers 
shevardnadze in a speech tuesday night to a private group 
called for an improvement in relations 
we can open up a new chapter in the history of sovietjapanese 
relations and then again they must be opened up he said if 
there are problems that cannot be solved between us we must search 
for the clue to a solution through talks dialogue 
a japanese foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said uno was likely to visit moscow for renewed talks in 
the first half of 1989 
kondo said the soviets had suggested the two countries study 
measures to encourage economic cooperation such as agreements to 
protect investments and set guidelines on economic relations 
the japanese replied that in addition to problems in the soviet 
investment climate the overall situation of bilateral relations 
is not suitable for further promotion of investment kondo said 
his report on the talks appeared to dash speculation that a 
soviet need for japanese investment to help develop the soviet 
economy especially the vast and resourcerich siberian region in 
the soviet far east would spur progress on the territorial issue 
kondo said the two foreign ministers talks on the territorial 
issue were frank serious and heated 
moscow has consolidated its occupation of the kurils which guard 
moscows access to the pacific with 10000 troops japan maintains 
that it pioneered settlement of the islands 17000 japanese 
residents were ousted by invading soviet troops in 1945 and has a 
historic claim to them 
earlier prime minister noboru takeshita urged shevardnadze to 
give serious consideration to the territorial dispute a foreign 
ministry official said 
takeshita said resolution of the dispute would be the basis for 
permanent and stable relations 
shevardnadze met with the japanese prime minister to deliver a 
letter from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the contents of 
the letter were not made public 
shevardnadze said gorbachev has a trip to japan on his political 
schedule and that takeshita was welcome to visit moscow the 
japanese official said no dates were mentioned 
in a 1956 japansoviet joint declaration moscow announced its 
willingness to return two of the islands upon conclusion of a peace 
treaty 
but at the last japansoviet summit in 1973 talks between then 
prime minister kakuei tanaka and soviet leader leonid brezhnev broke 
down over the issue shevardnadze refused to discuss it during his 
last visit to japan in 1986

prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and chinas 
president yang shangkun today discussed chinas troubled region of 
tibet and gandhi said his country will not interfere in chinas 
internal affairs 
the indian leader spent much of his second day in china 
sightseeing 
the official xinhua news agency said yang explained chinas 
position on tibet to gandhi during a onehour meeting at the great 
hall of the people 
yang 81 who has held the largely ceremonial post of president 
since april stressed that the beijing government provides 
assistance to the tibetan region one of chinas most backward areas 
we respect the religious beliefs and customs and habits of the 
tibetan people and they enjoy the freedom of religious belief 
yang said 
gandhi repeated indias position that tibet is an autonomous 
region of china and that india will not interfere in chinas 
internal affairs xinhua said 
the tibetan issue has long been a source of tension between the 
two countries because india has provided refuge to the tibetan 
religious leader the dalai lama and his followers who have 
demanded independence for tibet the dalai lama fled to india in 
1959 after he led a failed uprising against chinese military forces 
at least one tibetan monk was shot and killed by chinese security 
forces during a demonstration in the tibetan capital of lhasa on 
dec 10 it was the third outbreak of antichinese violence in lhasa 
in the past 14 months 
china and india are trying to restore friendly ties after a 
quarter century of soured relations which hit bottom during a 
21day border war in 1962 
the border question was the main topic during talks monday 
between gandhi and chinas premier li peng 
china claims 36000 square miles of what india says is part of 
its northeast state of arunachal pradesh india claims 14500 square 
miles of land seized by china in 1962 
gandhi and li however vowed not to let the border problem 
interfere with efforts to improve the strained bilateral ties 
gandhi is the first indian leader to visit china since his 
grandfather former prime minister jawalharlal nehru came in 1954 
accomapnied by his italianborn wife sonia gandhi today 
traveled about 37 miles northwest of beijing to the badaling section 
of the great wall the 3720milelong barrier built over a 
2000year period to keep out invaders 
the indian leader also visited the temple of heaven a 15th 
century structure where chinas emperors once prayed for good 
harvests and performed sacrificial rituals 
on wednesday gandhi is scheduled to meet 84yearold senior 
leader deng xiaoping and communist party general secretary zhao 
ziyang 
the two sides are expected to sign agreements on civil aviation 
border trade science and technology and the exchange of consular 
offices in shanghai and bombay

the border to bangkok 
on tuesday 30 burmese students met with chavalit in bangkok and 
asked his help in arranging a meeting between them and saw maung to 
discuss his request that they return 
chavalits visit to burma on wednesday marked a break in the 
informal international agreement to refrain from any moves that 
might imply recognition of the saw maung government 
thailands deputy foreign minister prapas limpabandhu told 
reporters today that he will visit burma to tell them we want to 
see burma develop democracy 
no date has been set

city transit officials have come up with a 
simple solution they say will make it harder for employees to pocket 
bus fares eliminate employees pockets 
opportunity makes the thief gordana swanson president of 
the southern california rapid transit district board said monday as 
she endorsed a plan to distribute pocketless uniforms to all workers 
who handle bus fares 
many workers who handle the money already wear such uniforms for 
those who dont ms swanson suggested sewing shut the pockets on 
their clothes until new uniforms can be provided 
the workers who still have pockets remove fare boxes from buses 
with special keys and put the money in carts the carts are then 
delivered to armored trucks which take the cash to the transit 
authoritys counting rooms 
the new uniforms were one of several recommendations transit 
authority general manager alan pegg made in response to an audit 
warning of casual pilferage and organized theft of farebox 
revenue estimates of annual losses range from thousands to millions 
of dollars 
auditors said most of the losses occurred in the counting rooms 
where they said they saw money lying loose on the floors in 
addition workers who count fares were allowed to leave the building 
without being checked by security guards auditors said

broadcast beyond the 3mile territorial limit off long island ny 
needs a federal communications commission license to keep operating 
a federal judge has ruled 
the ruling ends claims by alan h weiner of new york the ships 
former owner and one of four defendants that the radio ship sarah 
had a constitutional right to broadcast without an fcc license on 
open and unused frequencies 
jeremiah gutman an american civil liberties union lawyer and 
counsel to weiner and radio new york international argued that his 
clients had the right to freedom of expression over the public 
forum of the airwaves 
however us district judge john j mcnaught in a summary 
judgment granted the government dec 13 rejected the defendants 
contention that the broadcast spectrum is a natural phenomenon 
like oceans and lakes and is analogous to streets and public 
parks where free speech is a right 
the judge said the defendants could not look to the first 
amendment for authority to broadcast on an unoccupied frequency in 
violation of both federal and international law the first amendment 
does not grant anyone the right to broadcast by radio 
weiner has said he launched the pirate station to protest what he

leaders of israels two main political blocs 
agreed to maintain their longstanding refusal to talk to the plo in 
their new coalition government foreign minister shimon peres said 
today 
the rightwing likud bloc and the centerleft labor party were 
expected to initial their coalition pact today after negotiators 
agree on final details of foreign and economic policy the formal 
signing is expected in a day or two 
the agreement monday to form another coalition resolved a 
sevenweek stalemate after national elections nov 1 in which 
neither party received a clear mandate likud won 40 seats in the 
120seat parliament and labor won 39 
peres who spoke to reporters after labor ministers ratified the 
agreement said the pact reiterates the guidelines of israels 
outgoing government that there will be no negotiations with the 
plo 
the ban was maintained despite a us decision last week to open 
a substantive dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization the decision stunned israel 
the agreement also does not require the government to fulfill a 
demand by religious parties to pass a law that would narrow the 
definition of a jew to exclude those converted by nonorthodox 
rabbis 
the ammendment to the socalled law of return which fixes 
eligibility for israeli citizenship deeplu angered us jews most 
of whom are nonorthodox 
the government will work to keep the jewish people united this 
brings an end to a change in the law of return peres said 
the new cabinet to be headed by prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
likud is expected to command a majority of up to 97 seats in 
parliament or the knesset including several smaller religious 
parties expected to join 
it will contain 24 or 25 ministers 10 each for likud and labor 
with the remainder going to the smaller parties most key posts will 
be held by the same officials as in the last government with 
yitzhak rabin of labor remaining defense minister and ariel sharon 
of likud industry minister 
peres leader of the labor party will become finance minister 
the party chose the post for peres so they would have a springboard 
for funneling money to the nations ailing collective farms or 
kibbutzim many of which are aligned with labor and a string of 
industries owned by the histadrut labor federation 
the hadashot newspaper said the governments new program calls 
for a peace initiative aspiring for direct negotiations with arab 
states and a delegation of palestinians made up of leaders from the 
occupied territories 
the program vows to act aggressively to restore security in the 
territories and says all political peace initiatives would have 
to be approved in advance by the cabinet the newspaper said 
shamir and peres each needed a crucial vote of approval from 
their parties central committees before the agreement could be 
signed and a government installed 
likud officials said shamir faced a stormy reception from his 
partys central committee 
shamir has already come under criticism from party hardliners 
such as sharon a former defense minister who expressed concern 
that labors conciliatory stance would bring about an israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip where 
palestinians have been in revolt for a year 
sharon told israel radio today that because labor favors a 
partial withdrawal from the occupied territories a government with 
labor was liable to bring about establishment of a plopalestinian 
state and a continued arab onslaught on the rest of israel 
he blamed daily attacks on jews and us contacts with the 
plo for the political deadlock between the two parties which have 
governed jointly since 1984 
sharon attacked shamirs decision to join forces with labor on 
monday night by saying he thought likuds moshe arens should be 
defense minister instead of labors rabin israeli news media 
reported 
he reportedly accused shamir of failing to allow the likud to 
take responsibility and rule 
shamir reportedly replied by saying if the defense portfolio 
were in likuds hands we would have serious problems in the army 
at least 332 palestinians and 13 israelis have been killed in the 
arab revolt against israels 21year occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip

northern irelands highest court 
today ordered a new inquest into the deaths of three unarmed irish 
republican army members shot by police six years ago 
the northern ireland court of appeal ruled that the three police 
officers who fired the shots can be forced to testify at the new 
hearing no date has been set 
but sir brian hutton the chief justice made it clear that the 
police officers who have been acquitted of murdering one of the 
ira members can refuse to testify on grounds of possible 
selfincrimination 
the original inquest was adjourned in late november 
the three members of the royal ulster constabulary the 
provinces police force were among five police officers involved in 
the ambush on ira members gervase mckerr eugene toman and sean 
burns the three men allegedly failed to stop their car at a police 
checkpoint in county armagh in november 1982 
eleanor mckerr the widow of one of the victims fought to have 
the courts order the police officers to testify and be 
crossexamined rather than submit written statements 
coroner james elliott had ruled he had no power to compel the 
police officers to appear in person however his original inquest 
has been scrapped and the jury discharged 
inquests also are to be held into the deaths of three other 
unarmed roman catholics two of them guerrillas and the third a 
teenage civilian who died in two separate police ambushes in 1982 
police said all the deaths occurred in the normal course of 
antiterrorist activity but subsequent evidence suggested the 
killings might have been avoided and that police were operating 
under a shoottokill policy 
the mainly catholic ira is trying to oust britain from northern 
ireland and unite the majority protestant province with the irish 
republic

palestinian hardliners said today they 
will continue the armed struggle against israel to torpedo yasser 
arafats peace efforts and will seek to oust arafat from the plo 
leadership a palestinian source said 
the senior palestinian source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that syrianbacked radical factions were meeting in 
damascus to discuss practical steps and measures to counter 
arafats surrenderist moves 
the radicals have denounced the plo chiefs explicit recognition 
of israel and renunciation of terrorism arafats statements made 
in geneva last week led the united states to open an official 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization for the first 
time since the us banned plo contacts 13 years ago 
arafat was in yugoslavia today as part of his bid to gain 
international support for his peace initiative 
opposition to arafats campaign which is aimed at securing an 
independent palestinian state in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip appeared to be gathering momentum among palestinians who 
believe he has made too many concessions 
the united states has stressed it will break off talks if the plo 
carries out terrorist attacks while attacks by nonplo factions may 
fall outside that condition they could seriously undermine arafats 
initiative 
the factions meeting in damascus included the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command led by former syrian 
army capt ahmed jibril the fatahuprising of col saeed mousa and 
the small saiqa group the source said 
he said the radicals had formed a committee to discuss ways of 
ousting arafat and his allies to install a militant leadership 
which will adhere firmly to the plo charter and sponsor the armed 
struggle against israel as the only way to liberate the occupied 
territories 
the committee he claimed includes some leaders of the yearlong 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza and various 
palestinian personalities most of whom held senior posts in the 
plo he did not identify them further 
on monday a member of the plos governing body reflected a 
possible serious split in the organizations top ranks by calling 
arafats recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism 
arafats personal opinion 
mustafa zibri a member of the plo executive committee said the 
plo chairmans statements last week were incompatible with the 
resolutions of the latest palestine national council meeting 
the council the plos parliamentinexile met in algeria last 
month to declare an independent palestinian state it indirectly 
recognized israels existence and condemned terrorism but did not 
go far enough to gain us recognition 
the plo is an umbrella organization of eight different 
palestinian guerrilla factions dominated by arafats mainstream 
fatah group prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel claims it is 
bent on israels destruction 
zibris statement could represent serious dissent because of his 
seat on the plos 15member executive commitee which includes 
representatives of six palestinian guerrilla groups as well as 
independents fatah has three seats 
zibri is the sole committee representative of the popular front 
for the liberation of palestine a syrianbacked marxist group 
headed by george habash who told arafat at the algiers meeting that 
his faction does not believe in moderation 
it was not immediately known whether habash endorsed zibris 
statement which was signed with zibris guerrilla name abu ali 
mustafa the statement was delivered from damascus to the 
associated press in nicosia the office of the popular front in 
damascus confirmed the statement

prime minister ranasinghe premadasa 
vowing to halt ethnic violence on this indian ocean island was 
elected president with slightly more than half the votes the 
government said today 
earlier today sinhalese extremists hacked and shot to death nine 
supporters of premadasas governing united national party in a town 
east of colombo police said 
the politics of terror has no place in the temple of 
democracy premadasa said in a televised address immediately after 
the announcement i will eradicate fear and suppresion i will 
restore law and order 
premadasa received 504 percent of the vote in mondays election 
edging former prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike of the opposition 
sri lanka freedom party according to commissioner of elections 
chandrananda de silva 
premadasa has vowed to remove controversial indian peacekeeping 
troops when he takes over sri lankas most powerful government post 
jan 2 for a sixyear term 
ms bandaranaike had no immediate comment on the balloting and a 
man who answered the phone at her home said she was ill but one of 
her close allies said she had described the results as unjust 
and would not accept them the associate spoke on condition of 
anonymity and would not elaborate 
as promised outgoing president junius r jayewardene today 
dissolved parliament and called new legislative elections for feb 
15 he ordered an islandwide curfew to take effect after the 
official election results were announced 
i particularly wish to ask to appeal to those who belong to 
the winning side to treat your opponents who have lost with 
friendship affection and love he said 
with all 182 polling districts counted premadasa had 2569199 
votes or 504 percent compared with 2299770 or 45 percent for 
mrs bandaranaike the election commissioner said 
the remaining votes went to a leftist coalition candidate ossie 
abeygoonesekera the turnout was 55 percent well below the 
nationwide rate of 80 percent in the 1982 presidential election as a 
campaign of imitidation by extremists apparently kept many people at 
home 
officials have blamed sinhalese extremists of the peoples 
liberation front for the recent campaign of terror the extremists 
had threatened to kill anyone who voted on monday 
the military reported five indian troops were killed in an ambush 
by tamil ethnic minority rebels monday bringing the reported 
election day death toll to at least 20 
todays attacks occurred in bandarawela about 75 miles east of 
colombo local authorities said speaking on condition of anonymity 
they did not elaborate 
the threats kept thousands from the polls in the north where 
militants of the tamil minority are fighting for an independent 
state many voting districts reported less than 10 percent turnout 
and in the south where sinhalese extremists oppose government 
concessions to the tamils turnout ranged from 20 percent to 70 
percent 
premadasa was the standardbearer for the party of jayewardene 
who was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term 
under jayewardenes rule sri lanka neared the brink of ruin 
because of ethnic violence that has killed nearly 10000 people 
since 1983 when tamils began an uprising against the sinhalese 
with the help of neighboring india the subcontinents 
superpower and home to 60 million tamils jayewardene signed a 
peace accord in july 1987 aimed at ending the tamil insurgency 
the pact guaranteed some autonomy to the tamils who make up 18 
percent of sri lankas 16 million people and invited india to help 
end the uprising by sending troops which now number about 47000 
the peoples liberation front vehemently opposed the pact and 
vowed to kill anyone who supported the government after it was 
signed the front has been blamed for hundreds of slayings since 
both premadasa and mrs bandaranaike who was prime minister in 
196066 and 197077 opposed the tamil accord 
premadasa has called for the phased or immediate withdrawal of

organizers of george bushs inaugural 
parade passed over what was judged one of maines best high school 
bands in favor of the school that serves bushs summer home 
its a rotten stinking deal said william l reid the head 
of the boosters club for the mount blue high school band 
the 77member band located in this western maine town submitted 
video and audio tapes of its performances to the inaugural committee 
the committee had said selections would be based on merit 
including past achievements and the mount blue band believed its 
victory last month in the annual maine band directors association 
competition would give it the edge 
but reid learned monday that the mount blue band was rejected 
instead the only maine band picked to play in the parade was the 
one from kennebunk high school which serves students from bushs 
home in kennebunkport 
reid and other supporters of the mount blue band complained to 
members of maines congressional delegation that political 
considerations outweighed other factors in the bands selection 
people are enraged said rosemary poulson editor of the 
franklin county journal in farmington 
the leader of the kennebunk band made no apologies 
i cant help it if our band is from kennebunk bruce lewia 
said im sure there were political connections thats just the 
way the ball bounces 
lewias band has not competed in the state competition but he 
said it has participated in regional competitions outside maine 
were not some scrub band he said were a good band

the united states is making diplomatic efforts 
to dissuade other nations and private companies from selling libya 
materials needed to start up its huge chemical weapons plant the 
state departments top counterterrorism official said today 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said monday that the libyan 
plant was on the verge of fullscale production and l paul 
bremer head of the departments counterterrorism office said 
official are concerned its products might get into the hands of 
terrorist groups around the world 
bremer interviewed today on abctvs good morning america 
said there have been discussions with several countries in what he 
described as a major diplomatic effort to try to persuade 
companies and countries around the world not to sell the kind of 
precursors that are necessary for chemical weapons production to 
libya 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi has denied his country has 
developed the capability for chemical warfare 
bremer said in an associated press interview on monday that lybia 
has a longstanding close relationship with some of the worlds 
most murderous terrorist groups and has been willing to provide 
destructive weapons to those groups 
he said however there was no evidence the north african nation 
had distributed any chemical weapons to others 
us officials previously had acknowledged us concern about a 
large chemical facility reportedly based in a mountain chain 35 
miles from libyas mediterranean coast 
weve been following the developments of this plant now for 
some time it goes back even earlier than the first press reports 
about it in the fall said bremer on abc 
i think our objective now is to try to see if we cant persuade 
other people to stop providing the kind of chemical agents which are 
used in this kind of plant thats the major objective now of our 
diplomacy bremer said 
asked whether the united states would use military action to 
prevent chemical weapons production in libya bremer said im not 
going to comment on what kind of military measures might be used 
the united states has previously used military action against 
libya bombing tripoli in april 1986 in retaliation for the 
countrys alleged role in terrorist acts 
bremer also urged progress toward a worldwide ban on chemical 
weapons at an international conference on disarmament scheduled to 
reconvene in february

press freedom came under attack in 1988 from some 
of its staunchest defenders democratic countries such as the 
united states britain india and australia the international press 
institute reported 
the plight of the media remained bleak under repressive regimes 
but the trend in democrcies was the years most worrisome 
development the institute said in its annual world press freedom 
review 
one of the saddest truths facing the media around the world 
today is the growing trend toward government interference in 
democratic countries peter galliner the institutes director 
wrote in the reports introduction 
the hopes and encouragement of nations which are on their way 
towards more freedom and who rely on an example from countries with 
a democratic system an open society and freedom must not be 
crushed by governments in the free world he said 
the 32page report cited significant improvements in press 
freedom in taiwan and south korea and setbacks in chile colombia 
malaysia and other nations where journalism continues to be a 
sometimes dangerous and often difficult profession 
while the soviet unions policy of glasnost has meant 
heartening strides toward a more open press restrictions on the 
reporting of subjects such as ethnic violence in armenia have been a 
disgrace the report said 
the institute which has offices in london and zurich is an 
independent body representing 2000 publishers and editors in more 
than 60 countries its report this year detailed developments in 82 
countries 
in 1988 the us administration continued its efforts to limit 
public access to information held by the american government the 
report said 
it cited as a blatant example of interference in the media 
the us supreme courts upholding of the conviction of a former 
intelligence analyst for giving satellite photographs of a soviet 
ship to a british magazine the analyst samuel loring morison was 
sentenced to two years in prison 
the report also criticized the new canadaus free trade 
agreement for restricting canadian journalists who can work in the 
united states to those with a university degree and three years 
experience 
attempts to define qualifications for journalists pose a 
serious threat it said noting it was the first time the rule was 
enshrined in an international accord 
in britain the press scored a victory when prime minister 
margaret thatchers government lost its court fight to prevent 
newspapers from publishing extracts from spycatcher the memoirs 
of former intelligence agent peter wright 
however the report criticized britains ban on all radio and 
television interviews with 11 groups in northern ireland including 
the outlawed irish republican army and its political wing sinn 
fein the report called the ban the most drastic action taken 
against british broadcasters in peacetime 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india was forced at the last 
minute to withdraw legislation that would have shifted the duty of 
proving defamation from plaintiffs to journalists the report said 
an australian court ordered a journalist to reveal his sources 
and south africas press had an appalling year marked by 
threemonth publication bans for two newspapers and a onemonth ban 
on another it said 
elsewhere the media under dictatorships remained all too 
predictably under lock and key the report noted 
one of the worst years ever for the independent press in chile 
was marked by violent assaults on 24 foreign and chilean 
journalists five journalists were forced to leave colombia 
following the passage of an antiterrorist law 
jordan and malaysia cracked down on their press singapore 
continued to do so and china soured a promising start by reasserting 
control and suppressing negative news the report said 
however the south korean press had a watershed year with 
many visible and invisible restrictions lifted and in taiwan 
economic and political liberalizations were extended to the media 
the report said

after the conviction of lyndon h larouche jr in a 
case involving 30 million in defaulted loans the government is 
reviewing whether to proceed with a new trial of the political 
maverick on related charges here 
the move marks a change in course since federal prosecutors had 
vowed to pursue the boston case regardless of the verdict in us 
district court in alexandria va 
the complex boston case which ended in a mistrial in may 
included allegations of government infiltration of larouche groups 
a retrial is scheduled to begin feb 22 
a virginia jury on friday found larouche and six associates 
guilty on all 13 counts of tax and mail fraud conspiracy for failing 
to repay 30 million in loans from supporters including one woman 
who testified she lost 112800 in life savings 
the boston case is different said assistant us attorney 
john markham who also prosecuted the virginia case 
it charges different offenses and there is therefore no logical 
reason why it should not go forward but an officewide decision 
will have to be made after all appropriate people are consulted 
he said monday 
the 66yearold larouche faces up to 65 years in prison and 325 
million in fines sentencing in virginia is set for jan 27 
larouche who has run for president four times is known for his 
unconventional views including supporting an aids quarantine and 
charging that former secretary of state henry kissinger and the 
queen of england have ties to drug trafficking 
in boston larouche six aides and five political organizations 
are charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury 
investigation into allegations that larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign raised more than 2 million through credit card and loan 
fraud 
larouche is charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly 
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with 
investigators all the aides and organizations also are charged with 
conspiracy and four of the groups are charged with fraud three 
more defendants are fugitives 
us district judge robert e keeton called a mistrial after four 
jurors complained about the length and conduct of the case which 
was repeatedly delayed by defense motions the trial began a year 
ago 
the new court date hinges on a federal appeals court ruling on 
whether the trial would violate defendants protection against being 
tried twice on the same charges attorneys for both sides expect the 
1st us circuit court of appeals to support a new trial 
defense lawyers maintain the virginia convictions make the boston 
case moot and that a retrial would waste government money they long 
have charged that the case is politically motivated an accusation 
prosecutors deny

president reagan has taped a greeting for 
broadcast on soviet television on new years day and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev is expected to respond in kind the 
white house said today 
it would be the third time the two leaders have exchanged 
televised new years greetings 
they began the practice in 1986 after their first summit meeting 
in geneva 
in 1987 the soviets declined to take part in such an exchange 
saying ussoviet relations were not good enough to justify it 
reagan taped a radio message that was broadcast over the voice of 
america but was jammed in the soviet union 
the exchange was resumed in 1988 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president 
videotaped his message last week he said the brief message 
doesnt deal with policy issues 
he said details are now being worked out with the soviets and he 
anticipated that us television networks would be receiving a 
gorbachev tape for their consideration

a un conference today an adopted an 
international convention against illicit drug trafficking and drug 
abuse that it hopes will deal an efficient blow to those who sell 
and use drugs 
its significant because it represents a commitment by over a 
hundred other nations to cooperate in fighting the problems of drug 
trafficking and drug abuse us attorney general richard 
thornburgh said at a news conference 
its apparent that no one nation alone or within its own 
borders can deal with the multinational operations of the drug 
cartels thornburgh said 
the convention for the first time gives all signatory countries 
the right of extradition of suspected drug traffickers and the right 
to confiscate all their assets 
the document first conceived four years ago was signed by 43 
countries including the united states at the close of the 
monthlong un conference 
sixtythree other nations participating in the closeddoor 
gathering adopted the convention by consensus according to axel 
wuestenhage of the un information office 
it may take several years for the new convention to become 
legally binding to have legal force it must be ratified by 
parliaments or other national bodies in the signatory countries 
then given to the un secretarygeneral for notification 
many conference delegates were optimistic 
asked how the new convention matched recent antidrug legislation 
in the united states thornburgh said its a very good fit 
the provisions on money laundering confiscation of drug dealers 
assets and cooperation in pursuing the traffickers are similar to 
us legislation signed last month thornburgh said 
the united states would need only a minor adjustment to 
comply with article 3 of the convention he added that article 
deals with the identification tracing freezing and forfeiture of 
proceeds derived from drug trafficking 
the article is seen as a major way to toughen two earlier 
international accords by cracking down on modern drug traffickers 
whose networks straddle the world and involve billions of dollars 
the new document known formally as the convention against 
illicit trafic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances 
complements the 1961 convention on narcotic drugs signed by 121 
contries and the 1971 convention on psychotropic substances so far 
ratified by 88 countries 
besides providing for asset forfeiture and extradition the new 
document foresees mutual legal assistance and cooperation in 
training police and customs officers fighting drugs 
it also stipulates how to monitor substances frequently used in 
the illicit manufacture of drugs to eradicate illicit plant 
cultivation and suppress traffic by sea in freetrade zones and 
free ports 
thornburgh said the united states would have preferred stronger 
language on extradition with those engaged in crimes linked to drug 
trafficking eligible for extradition irrespective of their 
nationality whenever they may be found 
a special international commission will be charged with 
monitoring implementation thornburgh said 
asked about the cooperation of switzerland with its strict laws 
on banking secrecy thornburgh said washington had experience with 
switzerland which proved very positive with regard to waiving 
bank secrecy laws when criminal conduct is involved

the office of management and budget is seeking 
to prevent two federal agencies from duplicating each others work 
in setting safety standards for cleanup of hazardous materials the 
white house said today 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said a meeting is 
scheduled on the issue this week and a decision should be 
forthcoming fairly soo 
fitzwater said the problem of duplication arose as omb considered 
proposed regulations by the occupational safety and health 
administration governing safety of state and local emergency workers 
involved in cleanup operations 
a similar standard is being developed by the environmental 
protection agency to cover state and local goverment workers who are 
not under the jurisdication of osha fitzwater said this rule is not 
expected to be ready for about 90 days 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said in a letter to omb on monday 
that he had grave concerns about reports that the budget agency 
was intervening in the matter and that excluding state and local 
employees from the final standard would deny coverage to the very 
people congress intended to protect 
the osha regulation is before omb said fitzwater it is 
going through normal processing we dont feel there is any abnormal 
delay there is no real opposition to the regulations 
there is a meeting scheduled for the next few days to consider 
the two regulations and try to eliminate duplication wherever 
possible he said it should be forthcoming fairly soon

a bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in 
the chilly waters off virginia beach after failing to migrate south 
this fall and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to 
reunite it with its brethren 
the dolphin nicknamed rascal was spotted in early october in 
broad bay and residents around the bay began requesting that the 
government do something to save it 
on monday the national marine fisheries service agreed that the 
animals life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to 
save it 
its only done in extreme circumstances when the welfare of the 
animal is believed to be in danger said bob stone special agent 
with the service in newport news 
kathy read a diving instructor at the bay said rascal has 
slowed down and become thinner thats probably due to the food 
source probably drying up out there she said 
divers hope to go into the bay wednesday trap the aquatic mammal 
and then deliver him for a flight to warmer waters off the carolinas 
or georgia 
earlier this fall the plight of three whales icebound off alaska 
attracted worldwide attention one of the whales died but the other 
two made it to open water after a soviet icebreaker carved a path 
for them 
rascals rescue is to be supervised by robert schoelkopf 
director of the marine mammal stranding center in brigantine nj 
because he has captured dolphins before stone said 
the virginia institute of marine science in gloucester point had 
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin saying it could drown in 
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia bob byrne associate 
director for research at the institute said today that it will work 
with schoelkopf on the rescue effort 
schoelkopf agreed that a rescue is risky 
you weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if 
nothings done he said that animal would die in the area if we 
didnt do anything 
the dolphin is the second to become stranded in the bay in three 
years schoelkopf oversaw that rescue three years ago and helped 
save dolphins off the north carolina coast several years ago an 
attempted rescue of a dolphin in delaware a few years ago failed 
when the animal died of a heart attack he said 
rascal may fare better he said because apparently it is young 
residents have said the animal may not have joined other dolphins 
in migrating south because it was frightened of bridge construction 
in a narrow channel that links the bay and open water

polish leader wojciech jaruzelski today 
called on the communist party to reinvigorate itself and be open to 
unconventional compromises with the opposition 
in a speech opening two days of central committee debate on the 
partys role jaruzelski urged toplevel personnel changes and said 
the party is determined to remove all remnants of stalinism and 
embrace everything that is consistent with the spirit and 
realities of the time 
we have to remove this damned wall that separates the party 
from the young generation he said speaking unusually bluntly for 
a party leader 
however he also said the communist polish united workers party 
is and will remain the key political force of socialist poland 
in his speech jaruzelski appeared to confirm that changes in the 
party leadership were in store diplomatic and party sources had 
said the meeting might result in the replacement of some older 
politburo members with younger vigorous party activists 
serious personnel reconstruction of the party leadership is 
needed for the great work ahead of us jaruzelski said 
the party functioning in a new effective way will undoubtedly 
be a more dynamic promoter of national agreement there are no 
taboo subjects we are open for brave searchings and unconventional 
compromise solutions 
earlier government spokesman jerzy urban had said the plenum of 
the 230member central committee was to give important impulses in 
favor of reconciliation and help end the deadlock over launching 
formal talks with the opposition 
plans to hold the talks stalled after solidarity leader lech 
walesa demanded that the government clearly signal its willingness 
to legalize the trade union federation banned in 1982 a year after 
authorities imposed martial law 
urban told reporters today that prospects of the talks are 
not bad since we are noting an improvement in the internal 
climate 
on sunday walesa formally organized a 128member citizens 
committee whose purpose is to act as a united voice for opposition 
views on polands social and political problems 
the central committee meeting brings together top party leaders 
to debate proposed reforms contained in the 30page document 
prepared by the politburo 
we are ready to develop dialogue and look for new forms of 
agreement and cooperation with the opposition the document says 
adding the party can cooperate with any opposition group that 
respects the countrys constitution and considers its supreme 
values the good of the nation and state 
in a negative reference to solidarity the document says 
we will always oppose attempts to use the trade union movement 
for political manipulations and to transform plants into 
battlegrounds 
it appears to rule out the existence of new political parties or 
legalizing solidarity but it takes a generally conciliatory stance 
toward the opposition 
the document endorses public ownership of much of the economy 
maintaining polands alliances within the soviet bloc and preserving 
the communist partys leading role

tucker faces up to one year in prison and a 1000 fine 
tucker is the third former klansman to plead guilty in the case 
a federal jury convicted a fourth man five others are scheduled to 
stand trial jan 9 in birmingham 
the clash came during one of several protests blacks staged after 
the arrest of tommy lee hines who was charged with raping the three 
white women in 1978 one march ended in a gunfight and brawl with 
klansmen in downtown decatur in which several marchers and policemen 
were injured 
hines was convicted of one of the rape counts and sent to prison 
the alabama court of criminal appeals later ruled that he was 
mentally incompetent and he was moved to a mental hospital 
tommy spina an attorney for tucker said the former klansman 
pleaded guilty in part because hancock ruled last month that the 
conspiracy charge was a misdemeanor rather than a felony 
also the us supreme court refused last week to review several 
legal challenges to court rulings the klan defendants had pursued 
clearing the way for the january trial spina said

the federal jury deliberating charges against 
former miss america bess myerson asked today to rehear some of the 
testimony from the prosecutions star witness 
miss myerson and two others are charged with a divorcefixing 
conspiracy after 12 weeks of testimony the jury began deliberating 
monday and resumed today 
in late morning the panel asked to rehear testimony by sukhreet 
gabel as well as the judges instructions about direct and 
circumstantial evidence 
miss myerson who was miss america in 1945 her lover onetime 
city contractor carl andy capasso 43 and former state supreme 
court justice hortense gabel 76 are charged with plotting to cut 
capassos temporary support payments to his estranged wife 
all three are charged with conspiracy mail fraud and aiding the 
violation of state bribery laws 
the gist of conspiracy is agreement us district judge john 
f keenan explained to jurors monday during nearly three hours of 
instructions 
it wasnt necessary to find any illegal activity actually had 
been carried out for a conspiracy conviction he said adding that 
they simply must find there was a meeting of the minds of at least 
two of the defendants 
prosecutors contended that miss myerson 64 the citys former 
cultural affairs commissioner bribed mrs gabel by giving a 
19000ayear city job to the judges emotionally troubled and 
chronically unemployed daughter sukhreet 39 
miss myerson also faces an obstruction of justice count for an 
alleged attempt to influence the grand jury testimony of ms gabel 
the key witness on that count was ms gabel who conceded in her 
testimony that her version of the facts had changed in the past and 
might change again she also said that electroshock treatment she 
underwent for clinical depression left her memory at times like 
swiss cheese 
none of the defendants testified in their own behalf and keenan 
told jurors it would be unfair improper and indeed unamerican 
to hold that against them 
the prosecutions case consisted mainly of circumstantial 
evidence because there were no witnesses to the alleged bribe 
scheme there were however two undisputed facts sukhreet gabel 
was hired as miss myersons personal assistant in late august 1983 
and the judge slashed capassos interim support payments from 1850 
a week to 850 a week on sept 14 1983 
the defense contended that ms gabels hiring may have been 
unwise but was not illegal the defense also offered legal and 
financial explanations for the lowering of capassos support 
payments 
miss myerson faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and 513000 
in fines if convicted on all counts her two codefendants face up 
to 25 years and 263000 in fines 
capasso once a multimillionaire city sewage contractor is 
serving a threeyear prison term for income tax evasion

todays vote gives alva castro who is also the nations current 
second vice president control of the governing party

his new post to force garcia to form a new cabinet composed of 
mainstream party members 
garcia has been perus president since july 1985 his resignation 
from the party role did not affect his position as head of the 
country but indicated a serious eroding of his supoport 
his party opponents frequently accused him of ignoring the wishes 
of large sectors of the party in running the country and his 
reputation has plummeted in the face of the worst financial crisis 
to hit peru this century 
alva castro served as prime minister and finance minister during 
the first two years of garcias fiveyear term but resigned in a 
power struggle stemming over differences with garcia on economic 
policy analysts say 
alva castro defeated luis negreiros incumbent secretary general 
and garcia ally for the post in voting that concluded around dawn

since resigning from the cabinet alva castro has been 
campaigning for secretarygeneral considered a springboard to the 
party candidacy for the nations presidency

an english professor at darthmouth college 
who is also a syndicated newspaper columnist testified today that 
the administration at the ivy league school engaged in a pattern of 
trying to repress a conservative offcampus student newspaper 
professor jeffrey hart whose son was among the newspapers 
founders in 1980 testified that the dartmouth establishment was 
antagonized by the reviews espousal of a return to a core 
curriculum based on the great works of western civilization 
the counterculture and new left people of the 60s and 70s 
are now in positions of power and are shifting emphasis at 
dartmouth and other schools away from the great works in favor of 
such courses as womens black and native american studies he said 
the new campus leaders hart said select particular groups as 
oppressed and lead them toward liberation through a 
grievancegenerating mechanism 
earlier a dartmouth lawyer rejected charges that the college 
tried to stifle the dartmouth review and alleged that two former 
editors who were suspended deliberately provoked a professor in a 
grab for headlines 
what you wanted to do is provoke professor william cole so 
you would get something newsworthy right lawyer jack middleton 
asked former dartmouth review editor christopher baldwin on monday 
at the superior court hearing 
baldwin denied the charge and accused dartmouth of denying him 
and colleague john sutter a fair disciplinary hearing and unduly 
punishing them over a classroom encounter with cole in february 
baldwin 21 of hinsdale ill and sutter 22 of st louis 
seek reinstatement before their suspensions expire in september 
1989 their cause has drawn support from several prominent 
conservatives including william f buckley jr 
but judge bruce mohl rebuffed attempts by the students lawyers 
to argue that the sanctions will chill free speech on campuses 
nationwide 
i do not believe that the testimony along those lines is 
relevant to the reinstatement request mohl said 
baldwin sutter and a third student who are white were 
suspended in march for the encounter with cole who is black the 
confrontation came after the paper called one of coles courses 
one of dartmouths most academically deficient and denounced him 
for racist rantings 
the students denied racist intent but the incident sparked 
renewed racial unrest at the hanover campus the third students 
suspension has ended a fourth review staffer involved in the 
confrontation served probation 
the three students and the review also have filed a federal civil 
rights lawsuit against dartmouth alleging they were targeted for 
their outspoken conservative views such as opposing affirmative 
action and womens studies courses at the school sens william 
armstrong rcolo and gordon humphrey rnh as well as buckley 
have supported the students 
the staffers of the offcampus paper allege that a dartmouth 
disciplinary panel was packed with administrators teachers and 
students who disliked the review and were mindful of college 
president james freedmans public denunciations of the publications 
actions baldwin also charged that he and his colleagues were denied 
due process 
these students were disciplined and the extent of the 
discipline was because of their exercise or attempt to exercise 
freedom of expression and the newspaper is suffering as a 
result review lawyer arthur ruegger argued 
but middleton defended the disciplinary hearing process and said 
there has been no effort whatsoever by dartmouth college to stifle 
the dartmouth review 
the lawyer added that freedman who like cole is expected to 
testify in the hearing later this week has scrupulously 
acknowledged the right of the dartmouth review to express its 
views 
middleton urged the court to respect the private schools 
internal disciplinary authority he also defended the severity of 
the punishment as befitting an incursion into the classroom that 
he said could be the most severe case of such misconduct ever at 
dartmouth 
hart also dismissed charges that the reviews treatment of cole 
was racist 
cole listened quietly in the courtroom gallery 
review staffers said they tried to obtain comment from cole by 
telephone on the critical article but he declined calling them 
racist the staffers said that on advice of the papers lawyer they 
then went to coles classroom to give him a written statement 
offering him a chance to respond 
the students said cole cursed and threatened them myerson said 
cole should have been punished not the students

tuesday signed an agreement on production of china the first 
emperor a featurelength film of the man who united china more 
than 2000 years ago

sonny luu the film will cost between 20 million and 30 million 
and will include a cast of 30000 to 50000 extras including two 
divisions of the peoples liberation army he said

the last emperor the bernardo bertoluccidirected film of 
the life of henry pu yi the child emperor when the qing dynasty 
crumbled in 1911 won nine oscars and was one of the most celebrated 
films about china ever made 
luu said lumina an independent company making its first major 
production began working on the project four years ago and was not 
influenced by the success of the bertolucci film 
the us side will put up 90 percent of the investment and the 
chinese partner will put up 10 percent he said china will receive 
10 percent of profits and all earnings from the market in china 
richard attenborough director of gandhi has been approached 
about directing the film and the main actors will be americans of 
oriental descent luu said

broadcasting movie and television said emperor chin also known 
as qin shi huang was a great man in chinese history however he 
made many mistakes also and making a proper assessment of this

standardizing writing and weights starting construction of the 
great wall to keep out northern invaders and having the famed 
terracotta warriors built near his tomb in the ancient capital of

the washedup medical waste and other debris 
that spoiled new york cityarea beaches last summer came from 
several sources including a landfill sewer overflows garbage 
transfer stations and storm water outlets state officials say 
we have not found any evidence of a single culprit discharging 
the medical waste environmental conservation commissioner thomas 
jorling said as he released a report on an investigation into the 
waste 
several of the states most popular beaches had to be closed 
temporarily during the areas hottest summer in decades when debris 
including syringes and blood vials came ashore waste washups 
also resulted in beach closings in other eastern states including 
new jersey and rhode island as well as along lake erie and lake 
michigan 
the report blamed the washups primarily on inadequate garbage 
handling in new york city and on the weather 
medical waste accounted for only 1 percent to 10 percent of the 
washed up debris jorling said monday the highly publicized beach 
closings pointed to the need for more stringent controls on all 
garbage including medical waste 
the report highlights the need for change in new york citys 
sewage and landfill systems said a spokesman for a national 
environmental organization 
while an army of state federal and local people have been 
looking for midnight dumpers the real villain here may actually be 
the city sewer system and the citys landfills said mark izeman 
of the natural resources defense council 
while much of the beach waste probably was disposed of legally 
environmental officials still believe the vials of blood that washed 
ashore could have been the result of illegal dumping said jorling 
the vials at least one of which contained blood contaminated by the 
aids virus are the subject of a criminal investigation he said 
the state and new york city have strengthened garbage policies 
and improved facilities since the beach closings said jorling

the prosecution in the trial of a former lawyer 
accused of fatally beating his 6yearold adopted daughter rested 
its case today after an expert on child abuse testified that lisa 
steinberg was a battered child 
besides the medical expert the prosecution called a neighbor who 
told jurors she heard sounds of violence coming from the steinberg 
apartment the night before the child was found dead 
the defense was to begin its case later today in the 9weekold 
trial 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer is charged with murder in the 
november 1987 death of lisa who he illegally obtained at birth from 
an unwed teenager and raised as his own 
lisa was removed unconscious from steinbergs apartment the 
morning of nov 2 and taken to st vincents hospital where she 
died of a head injury three days later 
steinberg denies that he hit the child but his longtime 
companion hedda nussbaum has testified that he told her the night 
the child was injured that he had knocked lisa down and she didnt 
want to get up 
steinberg contends lisa died after choking on vegetables and her 
own vomit 
lisas death in an affluent welleducated household shocked many 
new yorkers and led to a reexamination of the duty and ability of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
dr margaret mchugh testified today that lisa was a battered 
child based on medical pediatric and autopsy reports and color 
photographs taken at the hospital and at steinbergs greenwich 
village apartment 
she said that multiple bruises the childs poor hygiene and the 
brain hemorrhage lisa suffered were consistent with child abuse 
neighbor joan bonano testified monday that she heard slaps and 
screams from the apartment before the night steinberg is accused of 
beating lisa to death 
ms bonano said she called police three or four times after 
hearing the sounds from the steinberg apartment two floors above 
her 
ms bonano also testified that ms nussbaum appeared increasingly 
battered in the years before the child died and that by 
november 1987 ms nussbaum was limping

the daily mirror and other british tabloids have 
risen to the defense of the duchess of york criticizing american 
designer richard blackwell for having the barefaced cheek to put 
her on his worstdressed list 
the mirror said tuesday that blackwell was so sensitive about 
his own precious looks that hes had them rearranged four times 
blackwell had hit out at the former sarah ferguson in a preview 
of his list of the worlds 10 worstdressed women saying she has 
none of the style of her sisterinlaw princess diana that she 
looks as if she makes beds in ireland or milks cows and that 
she walks like a duck with a bad leg 
until recently the tabloids have not been great fans of the 
duchess wardrobe saying it runs to frumpy outrageous and 
illfitting 
but the 29yearold commoner who married prince andrew in 1986 
has worked hard to retrieve her svelte figure following the birth of 
their daughter princess beatrice and her stylish wellcut new 
wardrobe has won plaudits from the tabloids 
for the popular press which has a nearobsession with royal 
watching and prints the minutest pieces of trivia the attack on the 
duchess was over the top and belowthebelt ripostes about 
facelifts were only to be expected 
what a jerk bannered the sun britains largest selling

a newspaper executives stepson was found 
guilty today of attempted willful premeditated firstdegree 
murder by a jury that also found he inflicted great bodily harm on 
the girlfriend he tried to kill 
bradley ackerman 24 sat stone still as the jurys verdict was 
announced in a packed courtroom 
his stepfather daniel ridder sat in a front row of the 
courtroom and remained grimfaced as the jury read the verdict 
the jury which reached its decision late monday and kept it 
sealed overnight issued three separate verdicts one finding 
ackerman guilty of attempted murder the second finding that he used 
a firearm illegally and the third saying he intentionally inflicted 
great bodily injury 
ackerman faces a maximum sentence of life in prison with the 
possibility for parole 
neither the victim julie alban nor her family was in court when 
the verdict was read 
ackerman pleaded innocent to attempted firstdegree murder 
saying he was in a valiuminduced stupor june 8 when he shot miss 
alban with a single bullet to the back paralyzing her below the 
waist 
ackerman who had taken more than 20 pills then shot himself in 
the chest inflicting a wound from which he later recovered 
prosecutors alleged that ackerman stepson of the chairman of the 
presstelegram in long beach fabricated the blackout defense to 
avoid taking responsibility for shooting miss alban 23 in her 
parents home 
the defense urged the jury to return a verdict at most of 
assault with a deadly weapon which carries a maximum sentence of 
six years in prison 
deputy district attorney ken lamb portrayed ackerman as a 
selfish irresponsible man who fired the 38caliber revolver with 
too much precision to be suffering from a druginduced blackout 
but defense attorney anthony murray blamed ackermans actions on 
the diazepam that he purportedly took to kill himself ackerman was 
in a state of depression partly caused by a 30000 gambling debt 
and his failure to fulfill his early promise as a tennis player 
ackerman testified that on the night of the shootings he only 
remembered going to miss albans home and laying out the contents of 
his wallet on a bed he said he didnt remember bringing the gun 
miss alban who attended the trial in her wheelchair testified 
that she awoke as the bullet pierced her spine then dragged herself 
to the telephone to call for help

leaders from the midwest they include the state party chairs from 
north dakota minnesota kansas south dakota illinois wisconsin 
nebraska and indiana as well as vice chairs from several states

who examine his background will be convinced hes right for the job 
ive built a ward organization ive run a city council ive 
run an 800 million business stanton said monday i have the 
communications skills to talk to the people who are going to 
financially energize any political party in this country 
i believe i have a very viable chance to win stanton said 
stantons decision followed a lengthy testingthewaters period 
stanton is a former congressman and cleveland city council 
president who dropped out of public life after a 1976 democratic 
primary loss to metzenbaum 
metzenbaum glenn ohio reps mary rose oakar and louis stoes and

city transit officials have decided the best 
solution to employees who pocket fare money is to get rid of the 
pockets 
opportunity makes the thief said gordana swanson president 
of the southern california rapid transit district board she 
endorsed a plan monday to immediately distribute pocketless uniforms 
to all workers who handle bus fares 
money counters for the regional public bus system handle about 
130 million in cash per year and officials hope that overalls 
without pockets and other security measures will put the brakes on 
fare box thievery 
an audit completed in may showed the southern california rapid 
transit district could be losing millions of dollars each year to 
casual pilferage or organized theft 
in the counting rooms workers have had uniforms without 
pockets for years said steve sibilsky a transit district 
spokesman the personnel who are going to be getting uniforms are 
the maintenance people who handle the vaults

aids in a few years is likely to become the 
fifth leading killer of americans from birth to age 24 if present 
trends continue say federal health officials 
meanwhile a general accounting office report says president 
reagans domestic policy council got in the way of public health 
service officials attempts at launching an antiaids education 
program in the spring of 1987 
the report is also critical of television networks for declining 
to run many antiaids public service spots when they did become 
available particularly those dealing with condoms as a way to 
prevent spread of the deadly virus 
the report issued last week said further that ther were 
problems with getting a national aids hotline operating at full 
speed although it said those lapses had been mostly corrected by 
last summer 
meanwhile dr antonia novello deputy director of the national 
institute of child health and human development told health and 
human services secretary otis r bowen on monday that aids is 
already the ninth leading cause of death among children 1 to 4 years 
old and the seventh leading cause of deaths among young people age 
15 to 24 
if present trends continue she said the disease soon will move 
up to no 5 
the five leading causes of death among people age 15 to 24 in 
1985 the last year for which figures are available were accidents 
suicide homicide cancer and heart disease 
for people age 5 to 14 the top five in 1985 were accidents 
cancer birth defects homicide and heart disease 
for children from 1 to 4 the top four were accidents birth 
defects cancer and heart disease 
for infants under 1 the leading causes were complications at 
birth birth defects illdefined conditions accidents and 
pneumonia and flu 
as of dec 12 1291 cases of aids had been reported among 
infants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the 
13to19year group of those 717 who were under 13 at the time of 
their diagnosis have already died along with 174 who were 
adolescents when diagnosed 
the official figures include only those children whose 
condition was reported to the centers for disease control said a 
report from a task force headed by novello probably for every 
child who meets the cdc definition of aids another two to 10 are 
infected with hiv it is estimated that by 1991 there will be at 
least 10000 to 20000 hivinfected children in the united states 
hiv is the virus that causes aids and health officials are 
growing increasingly concerned that a large majority of those 
infected eventually will develop aids and die 
the gao report requested by rep barbara boxer dcalif said 
that even though the centers for disease controls aids education 
budget increased from about 17 million in fiscal 1985 to nearly 
210 million in 1988 its efforts to focus national attention on 
aids prevention were impaired by the slow implementation of key 
activities aimed at the general public 
gao said cdc decided in may 1987 to designate the following 
october as aids awareness and prevention month but was unable 
to get clearance from the white house domestic policy council a 
cabinet group for its plans to conduct a national aids information 
mailing to all households 
congress had made clear it thought such a mailing should be done 
but had not explicitly required it congress made a mailing 
mandatory the following year and the pamphlet understanding aids 
went out to more than 100 million households last june 
in conjunction with aids awareness and prevention month in 
1987 cdc contracted for production of 38 public service 
announcements on aids and distributed them to the major television 
networks on sept 30 1987 the report said 
however it said there was only one airing by a network during 
the following month and only six the following months 
when ads did air they were not likely to be seen by many people 
between december 1987 and february 1988 gao reported nearly 90 
percent of all networkaired aids public service announcements were 
shown during nonprimetime viewing hours nearly 60 percent were 
shown between 11 pm and 7 am gao said

the economy expanded at a moderate 25 percent 
pace during the julyseptember quarter the government reported 
tuesday but analysts said growth was rebounding and the federal 
reserve board probably will nudge interest rates higher as a result 
the commerce department said growth of the gross national 
product the broadest measure of economic health slowed during the 
third quarter from 30 percent in the 2nd quarter and 34 percent in 
the first three months of the year 
the gnp after adjusting for inflation rose 242 billion to an 
annual rate of 401 trillion in the third quarter 
the gnp figure for the third quarter the slowest expansion pace 
since the final quarter of 1986 was a slight downward revision from 
a preliminary estimate of 26 percent issued a month ago most 
economists had been looking for a slight upward adjustment 
the trend should be good news for federal reserve policy makers 
who want to curb economic growth to a range of 2 percent to 25 
percent which they believe is sustainable without increasing 
inflation 
however the government said the temporary effects of the summer 
drought which shriveled crops and seared pastures are masking the 
true strength of the economy in the final nine months of the year 
drought losses of 123 billion reduced the gnp growth rate by 
09 percentage points in the second quarter 05 percentage points 
in the third and will knock more than 10 percent off of fourth 
quarter rate 
the growth rate in the final three months of this year excluding 
the effects of the drought will top 3 percent most economists 
believe in the first half of next year assuming a return to normal 
farm production the economy will be expanding at a rate between 3 
percent and 4 percent they say 
what youre left with is an economy that is growing too fast to 
be acceptable to the federal reserve said robert g dederick an 
economist with northern trust co in chicago 
fed members fear that a gnp growth rate higher than the target 
range will strain factory capacity leading to shortages and 
resulting price increases also by boosting employment the growth 
encourages employers to bid up wages the feds cure is higher 
interest rates designed to make it more expensive for consumers and 
businesses to spend 
the fed began nudging interest rates higher in late march 
capping a series of tightening moves in august with a rise in the 
discount rate the interest it charges on loans to member banks 
when economic statistics for october and november made it clear 
that growth remained robust the fed responded last week by bumping 
up the federal funds rate the rate banks charge each other for 
overnight loans by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 8 
percent to 8 percent 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer in new york said the next tightening 
move likely will come in the first two weeks of next month with 
another quarter point rise in the federal funds rate 
i think the fed will have to lean somewhat against those 
strong growth winds with a series of modest tightening steps 
but it will delay raising the discount rate if anything the fed 
is in danger of underreacting 
however other economists noting that consumer prices are rising 
at a 44 percent annual rate in 1988 the same as last year say 
inflation fears are overstated 
what were afraid of is the federal reserve will get carried 
away next year and raise interest rates too high and keep them too 
high too long said david wyss an economist with data resources 
inc a forecasting firm in lexington mass we might end up with 
a recession in late 1989 or early 1990 
but dederick and jones noted that a gnp price index which 
measures price increases in what americans are producing as opposed 
to what they are buying shot up at an annual rate of 53 percent in 
the third quarter the biggest jump in six years that was up from a 
50 percent rate in the second quarter 
in an accompanying report the commerce department said corporate 
profits after taxes advanced 39 percent in the third quarter after 
soaring 89 percent in the second quarter an earlier estimate 
which did not take into account profits by overseas subsidiaries of 
us corporations had said third quarter profits rose only a slight 
02 percent

prime minister ranasinghe premadasa was 
declared winner tuesday of sri lankas presidential election and he 
appealed for an end to the killing that has crippled this tropical 
island nation 
the ballots of the people have triumphed over the bullets of 
brutality premadasa said 
the politics of terror has no place in the temple of 
democracy he said i will eradicate fear and suppression i 
will restore law and order 
premadasas victory with slightly more than half of the votes 
ended a campaign marked by hundreds of slayings which the 
government blames on the peoples liberation front a sinhalese 
extremist group that opposed the balloting 
police said members of the group hacked and shot to death nine 
supporters of premadasas party tuesday in bandarawela 76 miles 
east of colombo 
a 9 pm to 5 am curfew was imposed on the nation of 16 million 
to prevent violence after the results were announced 
i have an appeal to make to those who have still to join the 
democratic process premadasa said in a nationally televised 
address your participation will enable us to eradicate fear and 
poverty with greater speed 
he also stretched a conciliatory hand to the two losing 
candidates although an adviser to the runnerup former prime 
minister sirimavo bandaranaike said she was not accepting the final 
results 
the intimidation campaign by the sinhalese extremists kept many 
people from the polls monday only 55 percent of 93 million 
eligible voters turned out to vote compared with 80 percent in the 
last presidential election six years ago 
premadasa received 504 percent of the vote followed by mrs 
bandaranaike of the opposition sri lanka freedom party with 449 
percent according to election commissioner chandrananda de silva 
he said no balloting took place in parts of eastern moneragala 
district because no polling officers had arrived but he added that 
the three candidates agreed not to make an issue out of it 
mrs bandaranaike had no immediate comment but kumar 
ponnambalam a spokesman for the fiveparty democratic peoples 
alliance that backed her said the candidate sent a letter to the 
elections commissioner requesting him not to announce results 
since she is not accepting the final count 
when premadasa takes over sri lankas most powerful government 
post jan 2 he will be working with a new parliament which was 
dissolved tuesday by outgoing president junius r jayewardene 
jayewardene has ruled for 11 years and was barred by the 
constitution from seeking a third term parliamentary elections are 
scheduled for feb 15 
the president serves for six years and appoints the prime 
minister and other ministers 
in washington the state department said we look forward to 
working closely with presidentelect premadasa to strengthen further 
the warm relationship we have enjoyed with sri lanka under president 
jayewardene 
the people and the leadership of sri lanka have displayed 
laudable courage and determination in holding presidential elections 
in defiance of terrorist threats the department said in a brief 
statement 
the current cycle of violence in sri lanka an island once famed 
as an idyllic tourist resort dates from 1983 when the tamil ethnic 
minority began its uprising against the majority sinalhese nearly 
10000 people have been killed since then 
with the help of neighboring india the subcontinents superpower 
and home to 60 million tamils jayewardene signed a peace accord in 
july 1987 aimed at ending the tamil insurgency 
premadasa opposed the plan despite being a top government 
official and boycotted the signing ceremony 
the pact guaranteed some autonomy to the tamils who comprise 18 
percent of sri lankas 16 million people and invited india to help 
end the uprising by sending troops which now total 47000 
the peoples liberation front vehemently opposes the pact saying 
the government should not compromise with the tamils 
the tamil tiger rebels seeking an independent state also oppose 
the accord and are fighting indian soldiers in the northeast 
premadasa has called for the phased or immediate withdrawal of 
indian troops but dealing with the huge neighbor could prove 
difficult 
indian high commissioner jn dixit has indicated his country 
wont accept unilateral action 
the peace pact was a bilateral one and the unilateral 
abrogation by one side will create an unprecedented situation he 
said recently as far as india is concerned we are firmly 
committed to the accord 
premadasa also stressed his determination to fight poverty in sri 
lanka where the annual per capital income is 360 he has proposed 
giving 75 a month to the poorest families but has not explained 
how to pay for the program

the national transportation safety board today 
blamed improperly loaded cargo for the crash of a commuter plane in 
alaska last year that killed 18 people 
the board said the ryan air service flight crew failed to 
properly oversee the loading of the craft and that so much of the 
cargo was loaded in the rear that the pilot lost control of the 
plane 
the real responsibility rested with the crew which is 
responsible for supervising the loading of the aircraft said 
james l kolstad acting chairman of the ntsb for reasons i guess 
well never know they failed in that function 
the twinengine turboprop crashed on approach to homer airport in 
homer alaska on nov 23 1987 eighteen of the 21 people on board 
were killed 
investigators had believed that ice on the aircraft might have 
contributed to the accident but the board said the ice did not 
cause but may have exacerbated the loss of control 
the crash was ryan airs 10th in eight years and the company had 
been fined 10 months before the crash for recordkeeping violations 
while the board did not explicitly clear ryan air for any blame in 
the accident it adopted no conclusions that the commuter airline 
was at fault 
the staff report was adopted on a 41 vote with board member jim 
burnett voting no because he first wanted to see changes in wording 
that were agreed to in the boards meeting

citing a lack of storage facilities and other 
problems the state department is urging americans to send money 
instead of relief supplies to earthquake victims in soviet armenia 
the relief lines are clogged up said rene bafalis a 
spokeswoman for the office of foreign disaster assistance who 
returned sunday from the scene of the earthquake 
in addition to inadequate storage space she said sorting out the 
clothing blankets and other items being donated from abroad 
presents problems for local authorities because of the large 
quantities involved 
she said soviet authorities turned back at least one flight 
carrying relief supplies because of the backlog 
the system is really overwhelmed she said 
ms bafalis recommended that americans make cash donations 
through either the american red cross or to local armenian 
organizations involved in earthquake relief

the tale of a priest who was forced to sell two 
prized lithographs to pay overdue bills at his jobs center generated 
sympathy and money but questions have arisen about the mans past 
one potential donor said he canceled plans to raise at least 
10000 for the rev john daechecks new times service center in 
glassport 
and the bank handling contributions union national bank in 
glassport decided to close the account tuesday because of 
skepticism about daecheck said manager jack katona daecheck opened 
the account monday with 500 
daecheck acknowledged he has had some brushes with authorities 
including an investigation by the us postal service regarding a 
publishing company he owned that filed for bankruptcy 
but glassport police chief edward mihoces defends daecheck 
what he has done outside isnt important the chief said 
he does help people 
some of the centers clients workers displaced by the decline of 
the monongahela valleys steel industry said last week that 
daecheck had helped them obtain retraining and submit resumes 
daecheck said he founded the nonprofit jobs center seven months 
ago in part to make up for past mistakes and has only the centers 
welfare at heart 
weve been here for seven months doing good work hopefully 
ill be here another seven months doing good work or until its 
needed he said 
to get money for the centers phone bill daecheck last week sold 
two 19thcentury french lithographs one a daumier for 500 to a 
pittsburgh businessman who also donated an additional 800 to the 
center 
bell of pennsylvania agreed to continue phone service because of 
assurances the bill of more than 300 would be paid 
daechecks advertisements offering the bargainpriced lithos 
attracted attention and he told the associated press last week that 
he was pastor of an independent russian orthodox church called st 
pauls in washington pa he said the jobs center was a mission of 
the church 
but after questions arose daecheck said he does not have a 
congregation or conduct services he explained monday that st 
pauls church is actually st pauls mission part of allfaith 
church mission inc in washington founded by the revs harry and 
helen harrington 
the harringtons said they ordained daecheck and hundreds of 
people based on the applicants knowledge of the bible and belief in 
god 
daecheck said he briefly attended but did not graduate from 
savanarolo theological seminary in scranton operated by the polish 
national catholic church a branch of the old catholic church of 
holland 
daecheck also said he was ordained in washington dc in 1981 
by bishop james miller of the orthodox church of america that 
church he said was based in anderson sc and is distinct from 
the betternknown orthodox church in america 
but the rector of the savanarolo seminary the very rev edward 
brzostowski said monday he had no records of daechecks attendance 
brzostowski and bishop kyrill of the western pennsylvania diocese of 
the orthodox church in america said they never heard of orthodox 
church of america directory assistance in anderson sc also had 
no listing for the church or miller 
if bishop miller isnt around theres not much i can do for 
you daecheck said my orders come from the orthodox church of 
america 
daecheck started the publishing company in 1974 he said he went 
out of business in 1982 after publishing about 150 books on a 
cooperative basis with the authors 
a lot of people are probably very bitter that i went 
bankrupt he said i went through a terrible time 
caren mariani deputy state attorney general in charge of the 
bureau of consumer protection in pittsburgh said daecheck failed to 
publish manuscripts make refunds on time or register the business

underground palestinian leaders tuesday called 
general strikes for christmas eve and the epiphany holiday on which 
orthodox churches mark christs birth 
the strike call for dec 24 and jan 6 follows a dispute between 
authorities and local palestinian officials over whether christmas 
celebrations would be held this year in the biblical city of 
bethlehem during the arab uprising against israeli occupation 
the army meanwhile reported it demolished three houses and 
sealed a fourth tuesday in the occupied west bank saying the houses 
belonged to members of a gang who attacked an israeli civilian and a 
policeman 
three palestinians were wounded during clashes between soldiers 
and stonethrowing youths in the west bank and gaza strip arab 
hospital sources said 
the call for general strikes was issued in a leaflet distributed 
in the west bank and signed by the plobacked leaders of the 
yearlong palestinian uprising 
the leaflet called for strikes as a rejection of the occupation 
and a rejection of any israeli participation in the christmas 
celebration 
it urged palestinian stores which have been open only from 9 
am to noon during much of the uprising to remain open all day on 
dec 23 and jan 5 so our christian brothers can buy what they 
need 
distribution of the leaflet came as israeli officials disputed 
statements by bethlehem mayor elias freij that christmas 
celebrations would be curtailed this year because of the 
intefadeh the arabic word for uprising 
israeli tourism officials put out statements saying that the 
usual choir concert would be held in manger square adjacent to the 
church of the nativity which contains the grotto where christ was 
born 
on tuesday israeli soldiers put up decorative christmas lights 
and a sign saying merry xmas and happy new year on the road to 
bethlehem and were constructing a stage for the concert in manger 
square 
freij a christian palestinian had announced that no lighted 
christmas tree would be displayed in the square this year and boy 
scouts would not take part in the traditional parade with church 
leaders 
he said this was because many west bank residents did not feel 
like celebrating after the yearlong uprising in which more than 330 
palestinians have been killed nine of them from the bethlehem area 
thirteen israelis also have died 
bethlehem once a small town populated mostly by palestinian 
christians now has a population of about 35000 many of them 
moslems displaced by the founding of israel in 1948 
the leaflet also called for two other general strikes in late 
december and early january 
it praised the united states for announcing last week it would 
open a dialogue with the plo calling the us move a victory for 
the intefadeh the leaflet also urged carrying on with the 
uprising as a national duty 
we must double our efforts so we can strike against the 
occupation army it said 
an army announcement tuesday said soldiers demolished three 
houses and sealed one in the west bank town of jenin and the nearby 
village of beit qad after uncovering a gang of 14 members who 
carried out attacks on israelis 
the houses belonged to four members of the gang who played a 
major role in violence which included the stabbing of an israeli 
civilian and an attack on a policeman the army said 
an army spokesman said he did not know if all the members of the 
gang had been arrested or if any of them had been charged with 
crimes or tried 
israeli troops also raided at least four villages in the west 
bank forcing residents to paint over antiisraeli graffiti 
destroying olive groves and conducting searches for suspects arab 
reports said 
an army spokesman said troops carried out some raids on 
palestinian villages tuesday but he could not give the number or 
exact location he said no arrests were made 
the spokesman confirmed a youth was shot by troops who fired on 
stonethrowers in the askar refugee camp near nablus the west 
banks largest city he said he was checking the reports of other 
injuries 
hospital officials said a 15yearold was suffered a bullet wound 
in the buttocks in a clash with soldiers in the west bank village of 
ain arik and another youth was shot in the shati refugee camp in the 
gaza strip 
the clash in ain arik near ramallah erupted after israeli 
troops brought in bulldozers to destroy groves of olive and lemon 
trees that youths used as cover to throw stones at passing israeli 
buses arab reports said

christmas should be a hopping good time for 
quasimodo wholl make the leap from pet store prodigy to house pet 
for some lucky youngster 
the rare redeyed albino bullfrog has lived at don suttons shop 
for 18 months greeting customers and entertaining hundreds of 
children but this christmas quasimodo is being adopted for the 
princely price of 5997 
at first viewers may mistake quasimodo for a plastic toy 
because of his outoftheordinary yellow color and his practice of 
sitting motionless for long periods but underneath hes all frog 
quasimodos unusual color is due to a lack of sufficient 
pigmentation to make him the runofthemillpond brownish green he 
was a highly unusual find for sutton who bought quasimodo from a 
wholesale dealer 
it was unusual that he was found before he was eaten he 
said most albino frogs stand out so much they are gobbled up by 
other predators somehow he survived long enough to get captured 
the nearly 2yearold frog is still growing and in the security 
of his new family he can be expected to live eight to 10 years

iron is discoloring the water in waterford 
township and hairdressers say theyre not the only ones who know 
for sure 
residents of the oakland county community who shampoo with the 
rusty public water supply complain that its turning their hair 
yellow orange and even green an undesireable shade even in this 
holiday season 
what the iron is doing is depositing on blond hair or any 
type of hair and it builds up said beauty salon owner cyndi 
edwards ive had cases where the hair turns green 
some of the townships public wells contain iron levels six times 
higher than michigan guidelines state and county officials said 
the iron doesnt pose any known health threats but it makes the 
water taste bitter smell bad stain laundry and clog pipes 
the township could end the problem by tying into detroits water 
network according to a report issued last week by the waterford 
water quality committee

a pirate rock n roll ship operating off the coast 
of new york cant continue broadcasting without a license from the 
federal communications commission a judge has ruled 
us district judge john j mcnaught issued a summary judgment 
dec 13 against al weiner former owner of the sarah and one of four 
defendants who contended the radio ship had a constitutional right 
to broadcast without an fcc license on open and unused 
frequencies 
weiners attorney jeremiah gutman an american civil liberties 
union lawyer had argued that the sarah was a foreignregistered 
ship in international waters and didnt come under the scope of the 
fcc he also maintained that since the station radio new york 
international was broadcasting on an unassigned am frequency the 
fcc was violating first amendment rights to free speech 
mcnaught rejected those arguments noting that the government 
said numerous stations could be subject to interference if the sarah 
broadcast 
weiner has said he launched the pirate station to protest what he 
called conformity in new yorkarea radio programming 
the sarah has broadcast only twice in july 1987 it broadcast of 
long island ny for about four days and then agents of the fcc 
and the us coast guard boarded the ship and stopped broadcasts 
the sarah was towed to boston after weiner promised a federal court 
in brooklyn he would cease operations 
everybody in the project is absolutely frustrated weiner 
said tuesday we could go on the air and not harm or create one 
single problem its just that weve got a hysterical fcc 
weiner maintained that the sarah is an international ship because 
it is registered in sealand a selfproclaimed principality in the 
north sea off the coast of the united kingdom prosecutors argued 
that britain does not recognize sealand and recently extended its 
territorial limit to include the unofficial country 
the judge said the defendants could not look to the first 
amendment for authority to broadcast on an unoccupied frequency in 
violation of both federal and international law the first amendment 
does not grant anyone the right to broadcast by radio

the inauguration of presidentelect bush 
billed as the most open inaugural celebration ever is now open to 
contributors who want to give less than 100000 
the presidential inaugural committee said monday it has dropped a 
100000 minimum requirement covering private donations for 
inaugural activities ranging from galas to childrens festivals 
the committee simply never anticipated the number of people or 
corporations that would want to participate at various levels 
weve been overwhelmed said committee spokesman ed cassidy 
organizers of the bush inaugural have said it will have more free 
events and include more of the public than any previous 
inauguration reflecting the wishes and style of the bush family 
time pressure prompted the initial decision to limit donations to 
100000 or more cassidy said he said accepting smaller amounts 
would have been too complex from an administrative standpoint 
at this stage he said preparations are well under way and 
initial financing has been secured our goal is to enable as many 
other individuals and corporations to participate as possible 
the 100000 minimum on private contributions had been criticized 
as giving wealthy corporations a way to curry favor with the 
incoming administration the private donations are not 
taxdeductible 
there is no disclosure requirement for private donations and 
inaugural officials have said they do not plan to release detailed 
lists of contributors 
cassidy declined to say how many corporations and individuals 
were seeking to contribute less than 100000 or what the lowest 
offer had been contributions must be linked to specific inaugural 
activities and events 
in a related matter cassidy said the committee has reached its 
goal of 20 million in guaranteed loans two hundred corporations 
and individuals have put up 100000 apiece under that program 
which is designed to secure upfront operating money for the 
committee 
the interestfree loans will be repaid after the inauguration 
from private donations and proceeds from the sale of souvenirs and 
tickets to balls dinners and other activities

the world court on tuesday ruled it 
has the authority to deal with a nicaraguan complaint that 
neighboring honduras is supporting rebels fighting managuas 
sandinista government 
the ruling was the latest step in a dispute between the two 
central american nations that has been before the court since 1986 
a final decision is not expected before 1990 
nicaragua has said honduras is actively supporting the contra 
insurgents and is seeking a courtordered halt to the alleged 
assistance 
honduras however has been contending the world court has no 
jurisdiction in the case it says it limited its acceptance of world 
court jurisdiction one month before nicaragua filed the complaint in 
july 1986 
the sandinista complaint came one month after nicaragua won a 
world court condemnation of reagan administration support for the 
contras 
tuesdays ruling means the court formally known as the 
international court of justice can examine the merits of the 
nicaraguahonduran dispute 
the 15judge forum is the judicial arm of the united nations it 
has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its 
rulings

the international committee of the red 
cross withdrew its 17member staff in lebanon on tuesday after the 
workers received death threats 
the swiss delegates left moslem west beirut for the christian 
eastern sector then boarded a ferry for larnaca cyprus said 
police in the christian port of jounieh north of beirut they will 
fly to switzerland on wednesday 
in geneva the allswiss organization said it had suspended its 
humanitarian operations in lebanon after hearing monday that 
serious threats had been made against its delegates on mission in 
lebanon placing their lives in acute danger 
the icrc therefore feels compelled to suspend its entire 
humanitarian operation there and to repatriate all its expatriate 
staff immediately a red cross statement said 
tuesdays action by the red cross marked the first time in the 
more than 100year history of the organization that delegates were 
withdrawn because of threats on their lives 
a committee spokesman carlos bauverd declined to say how the 
death threats were received and what group was believed behind them 
the decision came four days after kidnappers released the chief 
red cross delegate in south lebanon peter winkler who was held 
hostage for nearly a month 
the kidnapping nov 16 prompted the red cross to scale down its 
presence in lebanon after 20 years of operations in the strifetorn 
country ten of the organizations 27 delegates left but 17 
remained 
upon winklers release red cross officials in geneva said the 
staff would soon be increased again and regular activities resumed 
the communique said the committee was ready to resume its 
operations in lebanon as soon as the threats are clearly and 
unequivocally withdrawn 
a rumor circulated in geneva that the threats had been phoned to 
the swedish ambassador in damascus rolf gauffin 
gauffin was an intermediary in the contacts that preceded 
winklers release in those contacts his kidnappers identified 
themselves as members of a group called the organization of 
socialist revolution 
swiss authorities said winklers captors tried to tie his release 
to a lenient sentence for a shiite lebanese hijacker hussein 
hariri who is to go on trial at the swiss supreme court feb 20 
swiss foreign minuister rene felber said switzerland had refused any 
concessions 
hariri hijacked an air afrique jetliner to geneva july 14 1987 
and killed a french passenger before he was overpowered and 
arrested he faces up to life imprisonment 
the swiss made up the largest western community remaining in west 
beirut after waves of kidnappings assassinations and civil war 
violence forced tens of thousands of foreigners to flee lebanon in 
the last 13 years 
police said the new exodus left less than 24 westerners living in 
west beirut 
fifteen foreign hostages are now being held in lebanon they 
include nine americans three britons an irishman an italian and a 
belgian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
red cross delegates operate in about 80 countries worldwide 
visiting prisoners and detainees and providing food and medical 
relief to civilian victims of armed conflict 
their work is primarily based on the 1949 geneva conventions on 
the protection of prisoners and civilians in time of war

a 10yearold boy whose christmas looked 
so bleak he wrapped up empty boxes to decorate his apartment wrote 
santa claus a letter 100 elves couldnt ignore 
the letter said the only gift i would like is an elecric 
wheelchair for my mom she cant walk and her hands are to weak for 
the one welfair gave her 2 years ago i would love to see her 
outside without help and watch me play can you help me with my wish 
love john f wonggoun 
victoria coslett 39 was unaware that her son wrote the letter 
she learned about it monday when a postal worker dressed as santa 
claus arrived at her apartment laden with presents including a 
gift certificate for a motorized wheelchair both mom and son were 
partially disabled in a 1981 traffic accident 
the 100 elves who interceded for santa and handled johns request 
work at the us postal service in palm springs 
we receive about 1000 letters a year to santa claus said 
postmaster linda avalos the staff answers each and every one but 
this is the first time weve been able to do more than just write 
back 
the wheelchair was donated by an eastern manufacturer contacted 
by all active mobility a riverside organization that works with the 
handicapped the postal workers contributed 375 for its upkeep 
a grocery store chipped in for christmas dinner and there were 
presents for john too 
but john said the wheelchair is the best of all 
after the 1981 accident ms coslett was left with herniated 
discs in her lower back john who attends a public school for 
disabled children was partially brain damaged and still suffers 
seizures and memory lapses he also suffers from juvenile arthritis 
hes been through a lot ms coslett said my husband left 
me in 1984 and we stayed at the salvation army for three weeks in 
texas they gave us a bus ticket out here but by the time we got 
here we had only 2 to our name all we had to eat was cereal for 
the first month 
because ms coslett could afford no presents on her disability 
pension check this year john wrapped several empty boxes and put 
them under the familys christmas tree 
ms coslett said her son has always been selfless 
we went to the mall the other day with a friend i gave john 
10 to buy something for himself he went into a store and came out 
with a pair of earrings for me ms coslett said 
when i asked him why he didnt buy a toy for himself he said 
you told me i could do anything i want with the money 
its been hard for him to believe in santa claus ms coslett 
said but i keep telling him he has to believe 
john said he did not expect an answer to his letter i thought 
i was the last person who would get something from santa he said

the american israel public affairs committee 
has been shaken by internal turmoil in recent months raising 
concerns about the powerful proisraeli lobbys relations with 
congress and its ability to protect the jewish state from the 
fallout of strained relations with the administration 
the latest setback to befall aipac is last weeks resignation of 
its legislative director douglas bloomfield the organizations 
respected and popular liaison with congress it follows several 
unfavorable news reports about the generally lowprofile group 
based partly on documents supplied by disgruntled aipac employees 
included among the allegations were that aipac violated its 
mandate by supporting candidates in the recent congressional 
elections and that it mapped out a campaign to smear the rev jesse 
jackson 
observers and insiders differ on whether aipacs problems are a 
result of personality clashes or a reflection of fundamental policy 
differences within the organization which is viewed as possessing 
almost mythical clout in this powerconscious city 
but all agree it could not have come at a worse time for israel 
and the american jewish community 
the paternalistic alliance between washington and jerusalem is 
being strained by last weeks us decision to launch talks with the 
palestine liberation organization the decision taken after plo 
chairman yasser arafat declared he recognized israels right to 
exist is viewed by israels leadership as betraying a promise given 
13 years ago not to deal with its archenemy 
usisrael ties will be put to a further test in the months 
ahead by requests from saudi arabia for millions of dollars worth of 
arms sales there are indications the administration of 
presidentelect bush may be more inclined to acquiesce to those 
requests which were turned down under congressional pressure in 
recent years 
jewish leaders also are concerned that bush and his chief of 
staff john sununu who is of arab ancestry may be less committed 
to israels security than the reagan administration and especially 
in comparison with outgoing secretary of state george p shultz 
its now more important than ever that congress remain 
committed to israel said rep howard l berman dcalif who 
works closely with aipac and strongly supports the 3 billion annual 
us foreign aid to israel 
berman and others in congress who work closely with aipac say 
they perceive a shift from the organizations emphasis on lobbying 
the legislative branch to lobbying the executive branch others 
charge aipacs leadership especially chairman robert asher and 
president edward levy with a prorepublican bias that damns them in 
the eyes of the democratic majority on capitol hill 
the partisanship that is perceived as creeping into aipacs 
decisionmaking will hurt them in the long run said democratic 
rep lawrence smith of florida who has been instrumental in 
opposing arms sales to the arabs 
they have to understand that the real bedrock of support for 
israel is the congress administrations come and go were pretty 
constant and reliable smith said 
the perception of aipacs partisan leanings appears due in part 
to an eightyear republican administration which has been warmly 
supportive of israel for example jewish leaders say they were 
reluctant to criticize shultzs decision to reverse the ban on talks 
with the plo because of his traditionally staunch support for israel 
the perception is further highlighted because it contrasts 
sharply with american jews traditional support for the democratic 
party jews voted 2to1 in favor of michael dukakis over bush in 
the november elections 
especially disturbing to aipac supporters in congress was its 
reaction to the administrations request last summer for 40 f18 jet 
fighters worth 18 billion for kuwait aipac following israels 
lead contended that the sale to the moderate arab nation did not 
threaten israeli security 
smith who led the fight against the sale and counted on aipacs 
backing was angry they lost sight of the fact that in the long 
run this will be harmful to israel and america he said theres 
a legitimate debate about whether were selling weapons to the arabs 
as a bribe or whether we have a coherent policy toward them 
morris amitay a washington lawyer who was aipacs executive 
director from 1974 to 1980 cautioned the lobbys leadership about 
bypassing congress and trying to influence the administration 
directly its not very sophisticated of them he said anyone 
who knows how this city works knows its wrong 
aipac leaders declined to be interviewed saying the 
organizations low profile is essential for its behindthescenes 
effectiveness 
but privately officials said the organization wasnt moving away 
from congress noting that it is adding one congressional lobbyist 
to its list of five 
they also denied any republican leanings noting that some of 
their senior board members are known democrats

former rep james v stanton of ohio became the 
fifth democrat to enter the race for national party chairman on 
tuesday saying he represents none of the partys factions and could 
unify it for the 1992 presidential campaign 
stanton now a washington lawyer entered the race acknowledging 
he trails some of the other candidates 
i believe i can revitalize the party structure and bring all 
democrats under the same roof he said at a news conference i 
am uniquely qualified to do this because i am not the candidate of 
the south or the candidate of the northeast or the candidate of the 
right or the left 
the nearly 400 voting members of the democratic national 
committee will select a new national chairman when they meet in 
washington feb 910 
already in the race are ron brown a former aide to jesse 
jackson richard wiener michigan state party chairman former rep 
james jones of oklahoma the former chairman of the house budget 
committee and former rep michael barnes of maryland 
stanton has the backing of former house speaker thomas p oneill 
of massachusetts although oneill does not have a vote on the 
committee he is backed by his states two democratic senators john 
glenn and howard metzenbaum but his ohio party leaders have 
endorsed wiener 
stanton said he expected to compete with brown for organized 
labors votes on the committee and he called wiener obviously the 
insider in the race 
he said he would concentrate on party building and fund raising 
as chairman he dismissed jones proposals for building a permanent 
staff of campaign professionals to be folded into the eventual 
presidential nominees campaign and said he had no plans for 
changing delegate selection rules 
there are many people who want to tinker with the machinery of 
the democratic party im not one of them he said 
stanton is a former cleveland city council president who served 
three terms in the house before losing the 1976 democratic senate 
primary to metzenbaum

china on tuesday announced it would stop aiding 
the khmer rouge and other cambodian resistance forces as soon as 
vietnam withdraws its troops from cambodia 
the statement which appeared in the peoples daily was a 
further indication that beijings policy toward vietnams occupation 
of cambodia has softened 
chinas premier li peng made the statement at a news conference 
monday with journalists from china and india covering prime minister 
rajiv gandhis visit 
according to the report li said if vietnam withdraws from 
cambodia all parties including china should stop aiding elements 
in cambodia 
in addition li said in order to calm the fears of the 
international community as vietnam withdraws we will decrease our 
military assistance to the resistance forces 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and unseated the khmer 
rouge who had ruled the country from 1975 more than a million 
people are believed to have died during their bloody reign 
china the capitalist countries of southeast asia and the west 
support a threeparty resitance coalition comprised of forces loyal 
to prince norodom sihanouk the khmer rouge and son sann a 
westernleanding politician 
vietnam has said it will leave cambodia by 1990 and will turn the 
war over to the government of heng samrin which it installed in 
phnom penh in 1979 
but the cambodian forces are weak and there are widespread fears 
the khmer rouge will return to power after hanoi pulls out its 
forces 
on monday vietnam announced another troop withdrawal the troops 
were among the 50000 vietnam says are being sent home this year in 
its seventh annual partial pullout vietnam says the current 
withdrawal will leave 50000 troops in cambodia 
chinas position on vietnams occupation of cambodia has been 
evolving over the last few months as its relationship with vietnams 
main backer the soviet union improves 
initially china demanded vietnam withdraw completely from 
cambodia before china would even consider ceasing military aid it 
also had expressed close support of the khmer rouge 
over the summer china moved noticeably away from the khmer rouge 
and began backing a cambodian government headed by sihanouk 
in november li said once the vietnamese produced a timetable for 
the withdrawal then the military assistance to all the four 
parties in cambodia must and also can be graduwlly reduced and even 
totally stopped 
tuesdays announcement marked a further revising of the chinese 
position because it dropped the demand for a timetable

the state department expressed skepticism 
tuesday that vietnam will fulfill its pledge to withdraw 50000 
troops from cambodia before the end of the year 
vietnam contends that its commitment is being met with the 
withdrawal of 18000 troops this week 
but state department officials insisted that even if the 
vietnamese estimate of the size of the ongoing pullback is accurate 
it would only bring the total for the year to between 28000 and 
33000 troops 
while welcoming this weeks troop withdrawal state department 
deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said we remain skeptical that 
the 50000 pledge will be met she estimated the current 
vietnamese troop commitment to cambodia at between 90000 and 
100000 down from about 120000 at the start of the year 
since we believe vietnams illegal occupation is the root cause 
of the conflict we continue to urge hanoi to issue a precise 
timetable for the withdrawal of its remaining troops from cambodia 
during 1989 and to allow for the verification of their withdrawal 
she said 
vietnam has indicated all its troops in cambodia will be 
withdrawn by 1990 
mrs oakley said once all vietnamese forces are withdrawn and 
there is an acceptable political settlement in cambodia the united 
states would be prepared to normalize relations with hanoi 
some previous administration statements had conditioned the 
establishment of normal ties with vietnam on hanois cooperation in 
accounting for the estimated 1700 american servicemen listed as 
missing from the vietnam war but there was no such link included in 
mrs oakleys statement tuesday 
a state department official said tuesday the mia issue was being 
dealt with separately and he cited statements by president reagan 
and other senior officials suggesting there was no explicit link 
between the mia issue and normal relations with vietnam 
but last july secretary of state george p shultz linked 
diplomatic ties with hanoi both to a cambodian settlement and to a 
resolution of the powmia issue which if left unsettled will 
continue to divide our peoples 
asked whether the powmia condition had been dropped mrs oakley 
said we have been stressing that it is the complete withdrawal of 
all vietnamese forces in the context of an acceptable settlement in 
cambodia which will be the determining factor 
cambodias political future following the vietnamese withdrawal 
is highly uncertain the prohanoi government in phnom penh has been 
fighting against three rebel groups two of which are backed by the 
united states the third is the khmer rouge which is widely accused 
of having engaged in mass genocide when it ruled cambodia between 
1975 and 1978 
an alternate approach to us relations with vietnam was outlined 
in a report released tuesday by the aspen institute a private 
research group 
the report recommended the united states take graduated 
diplomatic steps toward vietnam if its troops are withdrawn from 
cambodia prior to a cambodia settlement 
these steps should include the establishment of small diplomatic 
missions in each others capital and adjustments in the us trade 
embargo against vietnam the report said 
vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the united 
states does not maintain diplomatic relations

president pw botha on tuesday 
fired the lone nonwhite member of his cabinet following completion 
of an inquiry into corruption in the indian chamber of parliament 
amichand rajbansi was ousted by botha from his seat on the 
cabinet where he served without a portfolio and also from his post 
as leader of the house of delegates

allan hendrickse was forced to resign last year after a dispute 
with botha over the future of residential segregation laws 
hendrickse is leader of the mixedrace house of parliament which is

any criminal charges might be filed as a result of the investigation 
botha did not specify his reasons for firing rajbansi saying 
merely that the action was taken in view of the findings of the 
inquiry commission

for providing school textbooks went to booksellers who donated money 
to rajbansis party that rajbansi was involved in improper 
allocations of business permits and that he improperly interfered 
in civil service appointments 
rajbansi 46 became a fulltime politician in 1980 he worked 
previously as a sports administrator soccer referee teacher and

the searing 1988 drought cut deeply into us 
and global grain stockpiles but the agriculture department said 
tuesday that normal weather could improve things significantly by 
this time next year 
drought in the united states and canada lowered world crop 
production by more than 6 percent the departments economic 
research service said 
crop prices will continue to reflect these smaller supplies 
early in 1989 the agency said in a new outlook report but 
expanded output is likely in the second half stopping the drawdown 
in stocks 
meanwhile world supplies of animal products will remain large 
enough to dampen increases in livestock prices however the demand 
for both crop and animal products is expected to be bolstered by 
continued world economic expansion and population growth 
the agency stuck to an earlier estimate that the net cash income 
of us farmers in 1989 is likely to be in the range of 48 billion 
to 52 billion down from this years recordtying estimate of 57 
billion 
firm prices for most commodities and larger production will 
mean total farm receipts slightly above the 1988 record the 
report said cash expenses are expected to rise moderately with 
expanded acreage and costlier inputs production items direct 
government payments to farmers are likely to fall onefifth 
as used by the agency net cash income is the amount of money 
farmers have to spend during a calendar year and is the difference 
between gross cash income and cash expenses for example 1988 sales 
of grain stored from harvests in earlier years are counted as part 
of the current gross 
in another method of bookkeeping the agency measures net farm 
income for the year not simply the cashin cashout system 
involved in net cash income 
this method includes changes in the value of farm inventories 
and allowances are made for nonmoney items such as 
depreciation the family consumption of farmgrown food and the net 
rental value of dwellings 
net farm income for 1989 is forecast at 44 billion to 48 
billion compared with the estimate of 39 billion this year

the soviet union has bought an additional 
750000 metric tons of us corn for delivery under a recently 
extended supply agreement between the two countries the agriculture 
department said tuesday 
it was the second consecutive day of large corn sales to the 
soviets with 750000 tons announced on monday 
however the department also announced the cancellation of 
200000 tons of soybean meal that had been scheduled for delivery to 
the soviets in 198889 no explanation was given but officials say 
conflicts in shipping schedules or price disagreements have been 
behind such cancellations in the past 
the latest sales brought total corn sold to the soviets to more 
than 703 million tons in the agreements sixth year which began 
oct 1 last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled 
slightly less than 52 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 750000 tons of 
corn would be about 295 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 258 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning the latest sale 
could have a farm value of around 76 million 
although no wheat has yet been sold for 198889 delivery under 
the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans and 
635000 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
the united states and the soviet union on nov 28 signed an 
extension of the previous fiveyear grain agreement which had 
expired on sept 30 the extension of the previous pact will run 
through dec 31 1990 
under terms of the agreement the soviet union is committed to 
buy at least 9 million tons of us grain annually including a 
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn 
the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as 
two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent

corporations reported a 39 percent rise in 
aftertax profits for the third quarter down from an 89 percent 
surge in the previous quarter but substantially above the 
preliminary estimate last month the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said profits rose 64 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted annual level of 1691 billion for the third 
quarter thats much better than the slight 02 percent rise 
reported a month ago but the department noted that almost all of 
the improvement came from profits earned by overseas subsidiaries of 
us companies 
the second quarter rise in profits had been the best in nearly 
five years 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch said the 
domestic operations of many companies are being caught in a profit 
squeeze they are paying higher wages and higher interest rates but 
have been unable to pass on price increases to consumers because of 
stiff competition both in the united states and from overseas 
were going to see some pressure on prices because profits are 
becoming harder to earn but companies are probably limited by 
competitive pressures it will be hard for companies to reverse 
the kind of profit squeeze were starting to see he said 
corporate profits before taxes rose 26 percent in the third 
quarter to 3139 billion following a 69 percent increase in the 
previous threemonth period 
dividend payments to stockholders rose 25 percent to 1057 
billion in the third quarter up from a 18 percent gain in the 
second quarter 
corporate cash flows a measure intended to show the funds 
corporations have available for investment rose 08 percent in the 
third quarter following a 14 percent rise in the apriljune period 
investment spending by manufacturing companies enjoying a boom in 
export sales has been one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the 
economy reduced growth in corporate cash flows could eventually cut 
into capital spending expansion

the number of americans behind in their 
mortgage payments fell in the julyseptember quarter to the lowest 
levels in a year an organization of lenders said tuesday 
the mortgage bankers association of america said 473 percent of 
the payments on the 108 million mortgages surveyed in the third 
quarter were at least 30 days late 
it was the lowest rate since the third quarter of 1987 when 471 
percent of the mortgage payers were behind the rate a year ago was 
the lowest in eight years in the second quarter the delinquency 
rate was 490 percent 
the foreclosure rate edged down to 026 percent in the third 
quarter compared with 027 percent in the second quarter 
warren lasko executive vice president of the association said 
he was very heartened by the decline but the report noted a 
mixed pattern regionally 
in north central states the delinquency rate was 488 percent 
down from 530 percent a year ago the rate in the northeast was 
unchanged from a year ago at 412 percent the lowest of four 
regions 
however the rate in the south rose from 525 percent last year 
to 529 percent the rate in the west was 428 percent in the third 
quarter up from 410 percent a year ago 
a high employment level in the united states generally has helped 
keep delinquencies low the south has had a relatively high rate 
because texas and other southwestern states are struggling with a 
depressed oil industry 
two offsetting trends will affect delinquencies next year 
interest rates are rising increasing the monthly payments on 
adjustablerate mortgages however the economy is expected to 
remain strong at least through midyear keeping the unemployment 
rate low

seven instructors at fort bennings 
airborne school were fined and demoted for socializing with students 
at the base in violation of the armys fraternization policy 
lt col mark lewis battalion commander said several female 
students alleged that they had sex with instructors but lewis only 
found evidence that instructors were dating students and of 
improper seniorsubordinate relationships 
airborne instructors in three of the four companies in the 1st 
battalion of the 507th parachute infantry regiment have been or are 
being investigated for socializing dating or sexually harassing 
female airborne students post officials told the columbus 
ledgerenquirer 
seven were punished appealed and had their appeals denied all 
were demoted in rank and fined the equivalent of one months pay 
the demotions of four were suspended for six months which means 
their ranks will be restored if no further infractions are charged 
against them during that time 
the students were not punished lewis said because he wanted 
them to continue to give information about the instructors conduct 
they also were not punished he said because instructors are in 
supervisory positions and know the fraternization policy but 
students even though they are given briefings on it are not as 
familiar with the policy 
the investigations began when a student was questioned about an 
unrelated incident and told brigade officers that instructors were 
dating students a violation of the armys fraternization policy 
the instructors are noncommissioned officers who teach and 
supervise students in a threeweek airborne course the course is 
one of the few at the post with students of both sexes 
col kenneth teel the school brigade commander said the 
incidents were not that significant considering 25000 students go 
through the course each year the school brigade oversees the 
airborne school 
im really rather surprised we dont get more sexual 
harassment allegations than we do he said the investigation 
found that it was not very widespread at all 
in an attempt to help solve the problem teel has hired a female 
instructor and is asking for other qualified women to volunteer for 
instructors positions

compromise in the ethnic dispute between the republics of armenia 
and azerbaijan and accused nationalists of using armenias 
devastating earthquake to sow strife in the region 
in a report that kept up a media attack on activists on both 
sides of the ethnic dispute the communist party newspaper pravda 
said officials arrested nine people on suspicion of inciting unrest 
in azerbaijan 
ryzhkov met with members of armenian artists unions in the 
capital yerevan before returning to moscow he had been in armenia 
almost two weeks to oversee relief efforts following the dec 7 
earthquake that killed an estimated 55000 people and left more than 
500000 people homeless

azerbaijanis in which at least 31 people were killed and more than 
180000 fled to escape the violence

adventurists who jointly with corrupt and hooligan elements hamper 
the effort to overcome the aftermath of the natural disaster even 
when the resources of the people are taxed to the utmost try to sow 
ethnic strife provoke illegal actions and in the long run 
undermine the spiritual health of the nation

frustration that the earthquake has not eased strains between the 
two southern soviet republics 
armenia wants to annex the predominantly armenian region of 
nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan azerbaijan and central authorities 
have rejected annexation 
ryzhkov and the armenian communist party leader suren arutunyan 
called for a compromise solution they spoke at a televised news 
conference

annexation demand had not solved the problem 
gorbachev gathered armenian and azerbaijani leaders in moscow 
following a session of the supreme soviet parliament at the end of 
last month on the basis of that meeting arutunyan said local 
officials were working to meet a deadline for a compromise solution 
within 12 days however he said the earthquake interrupted the work 
on the seventh day 
in a report from kirovabad azerbaijan where some of the worst 
ethnic violence took place last month pravda said three armenians 
i muradyan b sisyan and f gulgazaryan were held for 
investigation for allegedly inciting ethnic unrest among armenians 
living in azerbaijan 
it said the three flew to the kirovabad region several times in a 
helicopter to organize meetings pravda said a fourth person former 
soviet interior ministry worker lg mirzoyan was arrested for 
interference in agricultural work 
the report said in a report from the azerbaijani capital baku 
that five people were arrested on suspicion of taking bribes 
totaling about 160000 
it accused the five workers in the ministry of auto transport 
of helping organize unsanctioned meetings and demonstrations and of 
causing armenians russians and jews to be fired from their jobs 
it identified the five by the last names of ibragimov aslanov 
yusufov nabizade and ismailov

federal officials on tuesday approved 
evacuation plans for massachusetts communities near the seabrook 
nh nuclear power plant despite gov michael dukakis contention 
that residents could not get away safely in an emergency 
the federal emergency management agency which sends its findings 
to the nuclear regulatory commission to help the commissioners 
determine whether to issue a commercial operating license also 
approved plans submitted by new hampshire for its 17 municipalities 
that fall within the reactors 10mile emergency zone 
the conclusions could help seabrook eventually receive a 
fullpower license although plant officials still have not secured 
a 5 percent power permit to test seabrooks 1150megawatt reactor 
the evacuation planning process for seabrook has taken an 
extraordinary course since massachusetts which has six towns within 
the 10mile zone refused to submit emergency plans 
dukakis argued that it would be impossible to evacuate the 
seacoast area safely especially in the summer months when the 
regions narrow roads are congested with beach traffic 
seabrooks chief owner public service co of new hampshire 
submitted plans on behalf of the massachusetts municipalities last 
year after the nrc voted to change its rule to allow the 
utilitydrafted plans in cases in which state and local officials 
refuse to participate 
the 1987 rules change which was met with cries of foul from 
lawmakers massachusetts officials residents and antinuclear 
advocates was upheld in september by a federal appeals court in 
boston 
fema officials reviewed the utilitydrafted massachusetts plans 
under the nrcs guidelines which include the realism doctrine 
that agency policy assumes that state and local public safety 
officials would follow the utilitydrafted evacuation blueprints 
grant c peterson associate director of femas state and local 
programs division said in a letter accompanying the reports that 
the massachusetts plan will be adequate to protect the health and 
safety of local residents after the company installs its emergency 
alert system 
that system consists of 16 sirenequipped vans plus several 
backup vans and a sirenequipped helicopter that would alert 
massachusetts residents in case of an atomic emergency 
stationary sirens had been installed in the massachusetts 
communities but seabrook officials were forced to take them down by 
state and local opponents who won their case in court 
meanwhile the nrc prepared to vote wednesday on the final 
regulatory obstacles that have blocked seabrooks lowpower testing 
license 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon has said he will 
move immediately to block the license in federal court 
both remaining issues surrounding the lowpower permit involve 
the financial stability of seabrooks owners 
public service filed for bankruptcy protection reorganization in 
january and in june the fourthlargest shareholder massachusetts 
municipal wholesale electric co withdrew from the project and 
halted its 2 millionamonth payments

a police official testified tuesday that 
officers on the scene not the governor decided that 14 black 
lawmakers would be arrested during a demonstration against the 
confederate battle flag atop the state capitol 
testimony in the oftdelayed trial of alabama naacp president 
thomas reed and 13 codefendants ended tuesday but the judge 
hearing the case said he would not issue a verdict immediately 
reed then a member of the state house of representatives and 13 
other black lawmakers were arrested during their protest feb 2 and 
charged with trespassing they say the dixie battle flag atop the 
capitol is a symbol of racial oppression 
reed was arrested after he grabbed the fence around the capitol 
building which is closed for renovation and attempted to climb it 
the other 13 defendants followed suit with many simply placing 
their hands on the links in a symbolic protest 
the only witness to testify tuesday capitol police chief cecil 
humphrey said it was left to him and state troopers to determine 
whether a violation of the law occurred he said he had discussed 
security arrangements for the protest in advance with gov guy 
hunts staff but that the governor was not at the scene and did not 
directly order the arrests 
the defense rested after humphrey testified none of the 
defendants took the stand 
district judge craig miller presiding over the nonjury case 
said he would not issue a verdict until after reading written 
testimony by hunt who was questioned by defense attorneys in his 
office monday 
the dispute over whether hunt would testify in person had been 
one reason the trial dragged on over seven weeks even though only 
eight hours of testimony was actually heard spread over three days 
courtroom action came to a halt in midnovember when the defense 
called hunt as its first witness attorneys for the governor argued 
he should not have to appear and the judge eventually agreed with 
them and let the governor testify by giving a deposition in his 
office 
that delay was only one of several in the trial which first had 
been set to begin march 11 
reed was removed from his seat in the alabama house last month 
after being sentenced to four years in federal prison on an 
unrelated extortion conviction 
all 14 legislators were charged with seconddegree trespassing 
which carries a maximum penalty of three months imprisonment and a 
500 fine upon conviction 
the defendants claim they were protected by legislative immunity 
during the protest and that no trespass on state property occurred 
since they never got over the fence the prosecution contended 
trespassing occurred when their hands gripped the fence

northern irelands highest court 
on tuesday ordered a new inquest into the deaths of three unarmed 
guerrillas refueling the controversy over whether police shoot ira 
suspects on sight 
the court of appeals also overturned rulings by a coroner and a 
lower court announcing that three policemen who fired the fatal 
shots at the disputed 1982 ambush can be compelled to testify 
the high court had upheld coroner james elliotts ruling that the 
officers could not be forced to give evidence 
but lord chief justice sir brian hutton said the fact that 
they are suspected of causing the deaths of the three deceased is 
not a reason in law why they should not be compelled to go into the 
witness box 
but he added that the unidentified lawmen can refuse to give 
selfincriminating testimony the policemen already have been 
acquitted of murdering one of the members of the outlawed irish 
republican army 
they were among five officers who ambushed ira members gervase 
mckerr eugene toman and sean burns the three allegedly failed to 
stop their car at a police checkpoint in county armagh 
the original inquest was adjourned in late november while eleanor 
mckerr widow of gervase mckerr fought to have the courts order the 
policemen to testify and be crossexamined rather than submit 
written statements 
the original inquest has been scrapped 
inquests still are pending into the deaths of three more unarmed 
roman catholics two guerrillas and a civilian teenager who died 
in two police ambushes in the same region 
police said the deaths which occurred over a threeweek period 
came in the normal course of antiterrorist activity but subsequent 
evidence suggested the killings were deliberate and avoidable 
they have opened a fresh chapter in a 6yearold controversy over 
whether police conduct illegal campaigns to shoot ira suspects on 
sight instead of arresting them 
the roman catholic ira is trying to oust british rule from 
northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the mainly catholic irish republic 
in a separate development six british journalists announced a 
court challenge to the governments oct 18 ban on radio and 
television interviews with members of the ira its legal political 
wing sinn fein and its sympathizers 
financed by the national union of journalists their high court 
appeal argues the order is illegal contravenes the european 
convention of human rights and conflicts with the principle of 
editorial independence 
the measure aimed at silencing ira propaganda applies to radio 
and tv interviews with the publicly funded british broadcasting 
corp and independent commercial networks but not to newspapers or 
foreign media

the government announced tuesday it has picked a 
domestic company over a us firm to develop a new generation of 
battle tanks for the british army 
but officials said the new british tank would be required to meet 
stringent standards over a 21month development period if it fails 
they reserved the right to choose the us model or even a west 
german tank 
announcing the decision in parliament defense secretary george 
younger said the government would give the british company vickers 
plc a 164 million grant to develop prototypes of its challenger 2 
mark ii tank by september 1990 
in the final weeks the choice appeared to have narrowed to the 
challenger and the abrams m1a1 a tank made by the usbased 
general dynamics corp the us military has used the abrams m1a1 
for years 
british government officials said they would stay in contact with 
the foreign companies in case the domestic tank fell short of 
expectations 
they vickers will have to hit these development targets and 
hit them well and proper if we are to proceed younger told 
parliament 
prime minister margaret thatchers government agonized over the 
decision fearful of repeating the fiasco that ended in 1986 when it 
wrote off a dud british spy plane called the nimrod the nimrod cost 
nearly 2 billion but the government instead purchased the airborne 
warning and control system planes from the seattlebased boeing co 
the final contract for the new piece of hardware will call for 
about 500 tanks to replace aging chieftain tanks the contract will 
be worth about 25 billion 
vickers chairman david plastow discounted any similarities 
between the new tank and the nimrod there is no real parallel 
with nimrod no new state of the art hardware is involved he said 
general dynamics land systems division based in sterling 
heights mich said it was disappointed but would wait on the 
sidelines in case the british tank falters 
should their development efforts not meet those standards we 
would be prepared to reenter discussions with british officials 
concerning purchase of the abrams tank to meet their nato 
requirements company officials said in a statement read tuesday 
by spokesman karl oskoian 
younger denied published reports that british army chiefs had 
pushed for the abrams m1a1 while it is nice to feel that the 
best possible tank will be british it is not the driving force 
plastow had argued if the british government turned down its 
model no other country would buy it he said potential export 
orders to saudi arabia and other middle and far east countries 
totaling about 22 billion would be lost

paul d laxalt named by presidentelect bush 
to the commission looking for a solution to the deficit is a 
longtime confidant of president reagan and one whose own 
presidential hopes fell short for want of money 
laxalt retired from the us senate in 1986 giving up a likely 
safe seat from nevada but more than a senator he was a close 
friend and ally of the president a man laxalt described as like a 
brother their friendship dates to their days as governors of their 
adjoining states 
laxalt was also general chairman of the republican national 
committee and managed three reagan presidential campaigns 
after giving up his senate seat laxalt sought to become heir to 
reagans conservative legacy and win the presidential nomination 
but he found the going difficult and he ended his presidential 
bid in mid1987 more than a year before the election he said it 
was the lack of money he had raised about 1 million while bush 
was over the 9 million mark at that point 
washington is a fastmoving town he once remarked you are 
a memory very quickly 
his appointment by bush may move him back into the spotlight a 
bit 
bush named laxalt and a democrat former ohio rep thomas l 
ashley as his representatives on the 14member national economic 
commission 
the bipartisan commission is to recommend ways to close the 
federal budget deficit to bush whose read my lips campaign vow 
of no tax increases would seem to foreclose one option before the 
panel the panel was created by congress last year after the stock 
market plunge 
laxalt is the son of a basque immigrant sheepherder and still 
enjoys spending time at his familys remote 120acre camp in the 
sierra nevadas east of lake tahoe 
he ran a casino in carson city nev where he grew up and served 
as governor more recently laxalt was embroiled in a 250 million 
libel suit against mcclatchy newspapers over a story that said the 
internal revenue service had evidence of skimming at his familys 
casino both sides claimed victory in the suits dismissal 
he held no official position in the senate leadership no 
committee chairmanship and he rarely debated issues on the senate 
floor yet he had a hand in virtually every major decision of the 
first six years of the reagan presidency his power deriving from 
his closeness to the president

immigration commissioner alan nelson has asked 
attorney general dick thornburgh to wipe out a justice department 
unit that has supported central americans and others seeking asylum 
in the united states an internal memo shows 
at issue is the asylum policy and review unit which has prodded 
the department to override a number of immigration and 
naturalization service denials of asylum 
one point we would like to raise with you is the validity of 
the asylum policy and review unit said nelsons dec 13 memo to 
thornburgh which was obtained by the associated press apru has 
cost ins appropriations 750000 since inception the entire 
purpose of apru and its continued existence should now be reviewed 
by your staff 
apru reviews of asylum rejections by ins are just plain 
financially wasteful said the memo apru has persuaded ins to 
reconsider denials in 35 cases and has referred another 35 cases to 
justice department officials who then directed reversals said 
department sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
apru was established in 1987 to monitor ins asylum operations 
following a 1985 incident in which a soviet seaman who jumped ship 
on the mississippi river was returned to his soviet vessel on orders 
of the us border patrol the border patrol is part of ins 
the establishment of the justice department unit was a positive 
development in that it recognized that ins was incapable of handling 
the asylum function arthur helton an attorney for the lawyers 
committee for human rights said tuesday his group favors removing 
ins from the asylum process altogether 
this office serves a vital purpose and its staff is dedicated 
to ensuring that the purposes of united states asylum policy are 
carried out said henry curry the units director who declined 
to respond directly to nelsons memo 
nelson is urging the change in connection with proposed 
regulations first discussed three years ago which would implement 
the refugee act of 1980 that law established the standard of 
granting us haven to refugees with a wellfounded fear of 
persecution in their homelands 
the proposed regulations are finally being shaped at a time when 
nicaraguans and other central americans are pouring across the 
border illegally and then seeking asylum saying they have been 
persecuted in their home country 
nelsons memo asks thornburgh to review the regulatory proposals 
and to issue a final regulation by the end of the year thornburgh 
is in europe until later this week and has not yet conducted 
discussions on the proposed regulations 
ins spokesman greg leo declined to comment on the memo saying 
that we dont want to set a precedent in which each memo gets 
publicly discussed before it gets decided 
last week the ap obtained internal ins documents outlining a 
program under which nicaraguans and other central americans seeking 
asylum would no longer be granted work permits while their 
applications are pending ins is assigning additional personnel to 
handle the applications in an attempt to shorten the decision time 
on the applications to 30 days or less a process which could 
ultimately result in deportations for those whose claims are 
rejected 
nelsons memo also asked thornburgh to modify a regulatory 
proposal that would set up a centralized system of skilled officers 
who consider asylum applications and who would receive training from 
apru 
the commissioner instead wants the asylum officers placed under 
the control of district immigration directors around the country 
under that decentralized approach ins examiners last year 
granted asylum requests from 110 salvadorans and rejected 3822 
other salvadoran requests for asylum granted asylum requests from 
2786 nicaraguans and denied 2455 others and granted requests from 
24 guatamalans while denying 447 others 
asylum applications have almost tripled in the past year due 
primarily to the more permissive approach to work authorization 
said nelsons memo we need to take the necessary steps to prevent 
the existing situation and avoid the proliferation of this 
situation 
nelson was referring to a july 1987 statement by thenattorney 
general edwin meese iii which directed ins to encourage applications 
for work authorizations from nicaraguans seeking asylum 
some 60700 people applied for asylum in fiscal 1988 up from 
26100 the previous year

lawyers for joel steinberg accused of murdering 
his illegally adopted daughter opened their defense tuesday with an 
assault on the credibility and character of steinbergs chief 
accuser and former livein companion 
police officer thomas andry testified he had found a woman who 
looked just like hedda nussbaum drinking a beer and smoking in a 
strangers car while lisa steinberg the 6yearold girl the couple 
raised was unconscious in the family apartment nearby he said he 
was convinced it was indeed ms nussbaum 
in seven days of graphic testimony ms nussbaum testified that 
she never left the house after lisa fell unconscious sometime 
around 7 pm on nov 1 1987 the prosecution maintains lisa was 
unconscious because steinberg had struck her before going out to 
dinner with a friend 
the focus of this trial has shifted from joel to hedda 
steinbergs lawyer ira london said outside the courtroom 
he said there were unexplained bruises on lisas body and 
implied that the defense will suggest ms nussbaum was responsible 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer is charged with seconddegree 
murder in the childs death he denies that he hit the child but 
ms nussbaum testified that he told her he had struck lisa 
andry said that he found ms nussbaum sitting slumped down in a 
car near the couples greenwich village apartment around 840 pm 
on nov 1 1987 
he said he asked the woman if the car was hers she said no and 
he told her to get out she did 
her nose was distorted like it was messed up somehow her eyes 
looked like they were dazed he said 
the officers description of the woman fit the description of ms 
nussbaum a former childrens book author and editor at the time of 
her arrest nov 2 1987 charges against her were later dropped 
after prosecutors concluded she was too severely battered by 
steinberg to have prevented lisas death 
is there any question as you sit here today that the woman you 
saw sitting in the car on west 10th street was hedda nussbaum 
london asked 
theres no question about it the officer replied 
earlier in the day the prosecution rested after presenting 39 
witnesses since the trial began more than eight weeks ago 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax denied a defense 
request to throw out all charges against steinberg he did say he 
was inclined to drop one charge against steinberg endangering the 
welfare of the 16monthold boy police found in steinbergs 
apartment the morning they took the unconscious lisa to a hospital 
the boy was illegally adopted just as lisa was he has since 
been returned to his biological mother 
rothwax also said he would also instruct the jury to consider two 
lesser homicide counts not included in the indictment against 
steinberg they are seconddegree manslaughter and criminally 
negligent homicide 
steinberg is also charged with seconddegree murder firstdegree 
manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a minor with respect to 
lisa 
the prosecutions last witness dr margaret mchugh said lisa 
was a victim of child abuse she based her opinion on medical and 
autopsy reports and color photographs taken of the child 
she said that findings of multiple bruises the childs poor 
hygiene and the brain hemorrhage lisa suffered were consistent with 
child abuse

about 300 people marched to the 
presidential palace tuesday the anniversary of the worlds worst 
peacetime ship disaster and declared a curse on the government and 
the shipping line 
protesters burned two papier mache models of ships to commemorate 
the dec 20 1987 collision of the interisland ferry dona paz and 
the oil tanker vector off mindoro island more than 3000 people 
were killed 
two men slits the throats of two chickens and spattered the 
models with blood 
the marchers stopped and held their rally after police blocked 
them at a bridge leading to president corazon aquinos office 
in the name of all our loved ones wherever they are we swear 
that all those responsible shall be made to pay for the deaths and 
injustices they caused members of the crowd chanted in unison 
we will not lose hope until all those responsible are punished 
a presidential commission said at least 3563 people were aboard 
the two ships but only 26 survived survivors and relatives say the 
government and the dona pazs owners sulpicio shipping lines 
should provide more compensation to victims families and take more 
steps to prevent future maritime disasters 
tuesdays protesters lit candles to set fire to the papier mache 
models as the flames set off firecrackers inside the models 
hundreds wailed and began reciting a curse traditional among people 
of the central visayas islands which was home to most of the 
victims 
we vow to be more active in the attainment of justice for our 
loved ones and all other victims of oppression the crowd recited 
during the rally one survivor of the disaster arnel galang 
told the crowd the sulpicio lines had offered him money to testify 
that the oil tanker was at fault in the collision but he said he 
refused 
they think they can buy lives with their money he said he 
also laid blame on this uncaring government 
relatives of some victims say the government has tried to 
pressure them into accepting compensation offered by the ship owners 
dolores popes who said she lost her mother and 11 other 
relatives aboard the dona paz said she did not receive any 
financial assistance from the government she said sulpicio lines 
gave her 1500 
nazzer cajolo who reported losing five brothers in the disaster 
said the shipping line offered a 7500 settlement he said his 
family rejected it 
cajolo is one of about 300 people who have filed a classaction 
lawsuit against sulpicio lines the largest philippine domestic 
shipping company the suit was rejected by a lower court but an 
appeal is pending 
sulpicio lines suffered another blow last oct 24 when its 
passenger ship dona marilyn sank in typhoon ruby about 300 people 
were killed

bogus steam valve parts have been found at a 
nuclear power plant in michigan marking the third type of 
counterfeit equipment uncovered in the industry in the last two 
years the nuclear regulatory commission was told tuesday 
the commission staff issued a special notice to nuclear utilities 
last week asking them to be on the lookout for counterfeit valve 
parts of all kinds said brian grimes of the commissions office of 
nuclear reactor regulation 
failure of the valves could not cause a nuclear accident he said 
instances of counterfeit bolts and fasteners were found two years 
ago earlier this year counterfeit circuit breakers were found at 
plants in southern california 
industrywide inspections ordered by the nrc last month turned 
up a second type of bogus breaker this one at the commonwealth 
edison cos quad cities plant in illinois grimes said 
he reported also that in late october consumers power co 
unwittingly bought a number of counterfeit valve parts for its 
palisades plant at south haven mich 
grimes said a failure of such parts could lead to an automatic 
shutdown of the reactor 
consumers power discovered the faulty parts when a repaired valve 
leaked grimes said some of the parts they had procured turned 
out to be misrepresented and counterfeit and an investigation by 
the manufacturer masoneilandresser co concluded there appeared 
to be a counterfeit market he said 
he said the nrc staff does not yet know how extensive the 
counterfeit market is it is worried because valves are quite 
frequently refurbished and new stems gates and other parts are 
being bought all the time grimes said 
in jackson mich consumers spokesman paul knopick said a 
company consultant discovered suspect parts during a major valve 
renovation project some parts were discarded on the spot as 
obviously no good some were thrown out after special tests showed 
they did not meet specifications and some were installed after the 
tests showed they could be used he said 
knopick said he was unable to agree with grimes that the parts 
had been misrepresented by the seller its too early to conclude 
that thats still under investigation 
palisades was closed for refueling a month early in august when a 
steam generator developed a leak and the valve project was 
undertaken during the downtime it was restarted dec 1 and ran for 
six days before being shut down again because of another steam 
generator leak and knopick said consumers hopes to restart it 
before the end of the year 
the counterfeiting according to the staff notice to utilities 
may extend to other manufacturers 
a large nuclear plant may have as many as 40000 valves of all 
kinds 10 times as many as a coal plant of the same power rating 
a counterfeit valve found earlier at the diablo canyon plant of 
pacific gas amp electric co in california appears to be an isolated 
case said william brach chief of the vendor inspection branch 
the quad cities circuit breaker was of a largecapacity 
metalcased design that can be refurbished the california breakers 
were totally enclosed in plastic and designed to be replaced not 
repaired or refurbished grimes said 
the illinois component had been put through a substandard 
refurbishment in which parts were used that were nongenuine and 
nonconforming dimensionally he said 
a number of activities are under way to identify the source of 
the refurbishment he said 
victor stello executive director for operations told the 
commission the staff soon would propose a tightening of regulations 
on inspection of parts on arrival from vendors william hutchinson 
of the office of investigations said the staff was pursuing 20 
investigations of counterfeit parts

a halfmillion children died last year 
because their third world countries slashed social welfare spending 
when faced with unprecedented debt unicef said tuesday in its 
annual report 
james p grant unicef executive director urged leaders of 
industrialized and developing nations to convene a summit to deal 
with the crisis 
he made the appeal in unicefs annual report the state of the 
worlds children which he formally released at a new delhi news 
conference telecast live to 40 nations 
the 500000 children he mentioned represented only a fraction of 
the child deaths in 1987 recorded by the un childrens fund 
three million children died last year because they didnt have 
50 cents worth of vaccine in them grant said half these deaths 
occurred in south asia 
among a few bright spots he highlighted were vaccination programs 
in two wartorn countries 
in el salvador and in lebanon in the midst of war they have 
been able to stop the war long enough to immunize their children 
he said 
failure to vaccinate children results not only from the debt 
crises but from war ignorance lack of health workers and rugged 
terrains isolating people from medical care 
grant said that for children these were the best and worst of 
times 
they are the worst of times because after 35 years of progress 
a significant percentage of mankind 900 million people is now 
sliding backward into poverty he said 
its the best of times because lowcost ways of preventing 
childrens deaths are becoming increasingly available 
these methods include vaccination against diseases such as 
measles tetanus and whooping cough others are oral rehydration 
programs using inexpensive salt solutions that combat diarrhea 
chief killer of small children in many impoverished nations 
one of the most alarming trends he noted was that 16 nations made 
less progress against child mortality last year than they were 
making a decade ago because their debtburdened governments have had 
to cut back on social spending 
by far the heaviest consequences are being borne by the 
children said grant for these 16 countries alone the number 
of child deaths in the last 12 months is approximately 650000 more 
than would have been the case if the 197080 rate of decline in 
underfive mortality had continued 
the 16 nations cited by unicef are argentina brazil chile 
costa rica cuba ecuador haiti jamaica mexico panama in the 
western hemisphere and benin botswana liberia madagascar nigeria 
and togo in africa 
the unicef report said the developing world is now transferring 
20 billion a year more to the rich nations than it receives in new 
aid and loans developing nations owe 12 trillion to foreign 
governments private banks and development funds 
its clear that in the 80s private contributions for 
development have doubled while government assistance has declined 
grant said the governments should increase their aid but there 
is also the question of public opinion insisting that they do so 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi in a prerecorded preface to 
grants telecast said not only are the present needs of children 
neglected but in our greedy growth to development we are threateing 
to mortgage their future 
grant a us citizen whose canadian forebears served as doctors 
and medical missionaries in india and china called for a world 
summit to focus attention and seek solutions to the problems of 
children 
why shouldnt political leaders of both developing and 
developed countries have a world summit on children he asked 
to reach the unreached our conclusion is that one must first 
reach the unreacheds leaders

a spelunker who wrote a manual on how to find 
people lost in caves finally took part in his first rescue leading 
a team that found two teenagers just as searchers were beginning to 
fear the boys were in serious trouble 
bruce herschend who has been a cave explorer for 20 years and 
the team he formed nine years ago found two 16yearold boys who had 
been stranded in a cave for about seven hours sunday 
for what they had been through they were in extremely good 
condition said herschend the good thing was they were very 
calm 
the stone county sheriffs department refused to release the 
names of the two boys saying they could face trespassing charges in 
juvenile court the cave was on private property near here about 30 
miles south of springfield in southwestern missouri 
herschend said he did not even know the boys names 
the two were reported missing after they failed to return from a 
sunday afternoon outing at salt peter cave they became stranded 
after their two flashlights and a lantern went out and waited in 
the cool damp cave for more than seven hours before rescuers 
reached them herschend said 
herschend who manages two other caves near here that are in an 
amusement park was contacted by the local sheriffs department 
cave search and rescue is totally different from any other type 
of search and rescue said herschend whose manual gives tips on 
cave rescues 
its important that an expert caver is leading the team on the 
initial assault he said searchers should be very very 
familiar and comfortable in the surroundings if youve got the 
least little bit of anxiety about where you are that distracts from 
the 10000 other things that should be on your mind 
herschend and three other experienced spelunkers entered the cave 
after 11 pm sunday and crawled along an underground stream for 45 
minutes without success 
in most cave rescues the victims are found within that time 
herschend said worried he sent one of the initial team back to 
form another search team and set up an aid station within the cave 
but soon after he took those steps the boys were found waiting 
calmly for help at a point where the fairly simple passage became 
more complicated herschend said 
they went an incredibly long distance much further than we 
expected herschend said the intrigue and interest in the cave 
has a way of luring people on beyond what their common sense should 
allow them 
herschend estimated that the two had crawled four miles into the 
cave but said he could not be sure its hard to tell how far 
youve gone when youre crawling on your belly through mud he 
said 
herschend said he began exploring caves as a child and became 
interested in cave rescues when four cave explorers died after 
becoming stranded in another southern missouri cave 11 years ago 
when he learned later that most of the members of the first 
rescue team had left the area he turned to fellow explorers and 
formed his own team 
luckily were not needed very often he said we prepared 
ourselves long ago and its just not the kind of thing you forget 
herschend said he has been called on in the past when people have 
been believed lost in caves but until sunday authorities either 
found the victims by themselves or it was discovered that the 
missing people were not in the cave after all

press freedom was undermined in 1988 by governments 
in the united states britain and other democracies which should 
set examples of tolerance the international press institute said in 
a report released tuesday 
it called the development the most worrying aspect of its 
annual world press freedom review which surveyed the press in 
82 countries on six continents 
the hopes and encouragement of nations which are on their way 
toward more freedom and who rely on an example from countries with a 
democratic system an open society and freedom must not be crushed 
by governments in the free world director peter galliner wrote in 
an introduction to the report 
the institute which has offices in london and zurich is an 
independent body representing 2000 publishers and editors in more 
than 60 countries 
its report cited these examples of official interference 
washington continued its efforts to limit public access to 
information held by the american government 
the us supreme court upheld the conviction of a former 
intelligence analyst for giving satellite photographs of a soviet 
ship to a british magazine samuel loring morison is serving two 
years in prison 
under the new canadaus free trade agreement restricts 
canadian journalists working in the united states to those with 
university degrees and three years experience it was the first time 
the rule already part of us law was enshrined in an 
international accord 
prime minister margaret thatchers british government tried to 
ban publication of extracts from the spycatcher memoirs of 
former intelligence agent peter wright newspapers defeated the 
government in court 
britain barred radio or television interviews with 11 groups 
involved in northern ireland including sinn fein the legal 
political wing of the outlawed irish republican army in the most 
drastic action taken against british broadcasters in peacetime 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india the worlds most populous 
democracy agreed only at the last minute to withdraw legislation 
shifting the onus of proof of defamation from plaintiff to 
journalist 
a court court in australia ordered a journalist to reveal his 
sources 
israel suspended three palestinian newspapers for up to 45 days 
and shut down the palestine press service a prime source of 
information for the foreign press 
elsewhere the report found the media under dictatorships 
remained all too predictably under lock and key 
in chile there were violent assaults on 24 foreign and chilean 
journalists while five journalists in colombia were forced to leave 
the country following passage of an antiterrorist law it said 
jordan and malaysia cracked down on their press singapore 
continued to pressure the media and china reasserted control on open 
discussion and suppressed negative news 
south africa closed two church newspapers for three months and 
the countrys most outspoken antiapartheid paper the weekly mail 
was suspended for four weeks 
on the other hand the report said many visible and invisible 
restrictions were lifted on south koreas press and in taiwan 
economic and political liberalizations extended to the media 
in the soviet union the report declared it seems that 
anything goes these days no cow it is tempting to believe is 
too sacred to slaughter in fact however matters are not as simple 
as that we should never forget that glasnost openness began 
as and remains a policy guided from above

some government scientists working on the 
nuclear waste repository project in nevada are unhappy about the 
quality assurance paperwork they must do a member of the 
nuclear regulatory commission said tuesday 
nrc commissioner kenneth rogers said a recent tour he made of the 
proposed yucca mountain site indicates thats a bit of a problem 
rogers commented during a briefing by samuel rousso acting 
director of the energy departments office of civilian radioactive 
waste management on recent waste activities 
the commission will have to decide whether to issue a license 
currently scheduled for 1995 to the department for operation of a 
permanent depot planned for yucca mountain it will store for 10000 
years the highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel from the nations 
reactors that is now building up at each reactor site 
it is the first operation of the energy department to be 
subjected to the kind of scrutiny the commission has always given 
civilian nuclear power plants the departments weaponsbuilding 
activities are exempt from commission rules 
rousso agreed the waste depot project means some change in 
philosophy and culture and assured rogers that field personnel 
will be trained in quality assurance 
though often confused with quality control quality assurance is 
distinct it is the proof of quality control documentation that the 
work has been done correctly an example might be a weld in a pipe 
in a nuclear power plant an xray kept on file of the completed 
weld showing no flaws would be the assurance that the weld had been 
done correctly 
in the civilian nuclear power industry the commission insists on 
documentation of every step of work and failure to conform has led 
some plants into costly reconstruction before completion 
the waste project is imposing a regulatory process on 
scientists who have not operated in this mode in the past 
geologists hydrologists rogers said 
the dismay he said surfaced among people who were on the tour 
with me some of them government people who expressed a little 
concern about this 
in his presentation rousso noted that the scheduled beginning of 
the first investigative drilling into yucca mountain had been 
delayed five months to november 1989 to ensure that all necessary 
quality assurance plans and procedures and other necessary 
documentation and analyses are in place 
responding to rogers he said quality assurance is an area we 
feel quite strongly about as shown by the formation of a quality 
assurance unit several months ago in the office of civilian 
radioactive waste management

foreign diplomats must forget tradition and 
play the american game if they want to be effective in 
washington the retiring canadian ambassador said tuesday 
ambassador allan gotlieb told a national press club audience that 
in washington a foreign government is a special interest and not 
a very special one at that 
if you want to be a successful diplomat in washington forget 
what you have ever learned about traditional diplomacy said 
gotlieb who arrived in washington seven years ago get up get 
out on the field and play the american game 
he likened the political scene to a large magnetic field crowded 
with thousands of electrically charged players ranging from 
politicians to lobbyists and reporters who sometimes form 
harmonious patterns but often repel each other 
political action committees dressed as trainers dispense the 
steroids of modern politics money to the players on all sides 
he said there are no referees 
on the washington political scene every country is famous for 
15 minutes he said adding that americans mainly were interested 
in the recent canadian election because it affected the us agenda 
he was asked about an incident several years ago in which his 
wife sondra slapped the face of the embassys social secretary at a 
washington dinner for canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
gotlieb said his effectiveness as a diplomat was not harmed by 
what he termed a spontaneous and unfortunate incident 
gotlieb who is retiring from public service after 30 years 
becomes chairman of the canada council on feb 1 and will be a 
visiting professor at harvard university in cambridge mass for 
the spring term before settling in toronto

researchers in west africa have isolated the 
aids virus and its african cousin from the same patient showing 
both can infect the same individual scientists report 
previous studies had suggested the two viruses could infect the 
same person but the new study confirms it by isolating the viruses 
themselves researchers said 
in a tatement from the university of california at san francisco 
researchers said the finding indicates that individuals infected 
with one strain should continue to take precautions against becoming 
infected by the second the combination of both strains might speed 
up damage to the immune system they said 
the work appears in the dec 17 issue of the lancet a british 
medical journal 
researchers from ucsf and africa reported isolating hiv1 the 
virus that causes aids in the united states and the african hiv2 
virus from a 37yearold woman from the ivory coast 
the viruses cause a variety of diseases including acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome aids from hiv1 has killed about 45000 
people so far in the united states but hiv2 has been found here in 
only one west african patient visiting the united states the hiv2 
strain has been primarily limited to west africa and parts of europe 
the study was led by ucsf postdoctoral researcher louise evans

kremlin officials ended their direct supervision of 
earthquake relief efforts tuesday and attention turned to 
rebuilding armenias wrecked cities to withstand future quakes 
the return to moscow of the politburo commission led by premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov which went to armenia the day after the dec 7 
earthquake indicated rescue operations were coming to an end and a 
long period of reconstruction was beginning 
for the first time since the first days after the quake news 
from armenia was bumped from the lead item on the evening tv news 
program vremya it was replaced by a report on a kremlin 
conference of educators 
tass the official news agency said more than 500 children had 
been reunited with parents or relatives in recent days 
a leading soviet seismologist nikolai laverov told the agency 
tremors continued but their pattern indicated they would fade 
ryzhkov in a news conference broadcast on nationwide television 
tuesday criticized what he said was the very low quality of 
construction of multistory apartment buildings destroyed by the 
earthquake 
the official media said plans were being set to reconstruct 
cities such as spitak and leninakan to prevent a repeat of the 
disaster 
a decision was made to use a method of construction where low 
buildings are erected abutting one another this will help create a 
kind of stone belt which will become a protective hoop in case of an 
earthquake tass said 
the cities will be rebuilt with low stone houses as well as more 
standard concrete and reinforced concrete buildings tass said 
the earthquake that devastated northwestern armenia killed an 
estimated 55000 people ryzhkov said 514000 people were left 
homeless 
tass said a group of architects seismologists geologists and 
other experts were working in yerevan to develop plans for 
rebuilding the cities it promised that all plans would be offered 
to the public for debate 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported that sketches had 
been prepared for construction of about 3000 singlefamily houses 
with yards it said that in the near future a special store would 
be opened where individuals building their own homes can buy the 
materials they need 
a government commission has been formed to study why five and 
ninestory prefabricated concrete apartment houses built in the last 
20 years crumbled in the earthquake while many older buildings 
remained standing despite damage 
ryzhkov said preliminary findings indicated that the new 
buildings could not withstand sharp lengthwise shifts in the ground 
the earthquake centered about 25 miles north of leninakan 
registered 69 on the richter scale 
in an interview with soviet television ryzhkov said the first 
stage of the relief operation that of rescuing survivors would 
end in several days echoing reports in the official media the 
last rescue of an earthquake survivor was reported to have occurred 
saturday 
in a meeting with reporters on dec 12 ryzhkov said he defense 
minister dmitri t yazov and fellow politburo member nikolai n 
slyunkov would remain in armenia to oversee the relief efforts until 
they were certain work was going well and the necessary rhythm of 
work is guaranteed 
he said in an interview with soviet tv that the commission would 
return in january 
asked about the danger of epidemic in the earthquake areas where 
thousands of bodies still have not been recovered ryzhkov told his 
interviewer there was no such danger in the large cities he said a 
danger had existed in villages because of the presence of thousands 
of dead animals but that special teams had the problem under 
control 
mother teresa the 1979 nobel peace prize winner who arrived in 
the soviet union last week and visited armenia was quoted by tass 
as saying i will soon return here together with my sister nuns to 
extend aid to the sufferers 
we have been stunned by the scale of the disaster she was 
quoted as saying 
there was no further word on whether she and soviet officials had 
reached a firm agreement for mother teresas missionaries of charity 
to work in the soviet union where charity work by religious 
organizations is prohibited by law 
mother teresa met with ryzhkov on monday since a visit last 
year she has been trying to open the soviet union to her 
missionaries

regional and linguistic antagonisms that have 
threatened unity throughout canadas history are reviving because 
quebec will not comply with a ruling that it allow the posting of 
signs in english 
the supreme court said last week the predominantly 
frenchspeaking province is justified in making sure french 
predominates on signs but cannot prevent the use of other languages 
robert bourassa the provincial premier angered both english 
speakers and militants from the majority with his compromise last 
sunday french must remain the only language on outdoor signs but 
other languages can be used indoors so long as french predominates 
environment minister clifford lincoln one of four english 
speakers in bourassas cabinet resigned tuesday and said in my 
beliefs rights are rights are rights there are no partial rights 
there are no indooroutdoor rights 
two of the other english speakers public security minister 
herbert marx and communications minister richard french quit later 
tuesday 
bourassa based his decision on a clause put into the constitution 
by western provinces as a protection against federal power which 
allows provinces or the national government to override a court 
decision 
the resumption of divisiveness in canada followed four years of 
general calm that made possible the 1987 meech lake constitutional 
agreement recognizing quebec as a distinct society 
only eight of the 10 provinces have ratified the accord named 
for the place in quebec where it was signed premier gary filmon of 
manitoba said monday he no longer would push for legislative 
approval in his western province because of bourassas action 
new brunswick on the atlantic coast is the other province yet 
to ratify the agreement 
filmon described the quebec decision as a national tragedy 
and called for a national conference of provincial leaders to 
persuade the frenchspeaking province to accept the court decision 
which language can be used on signs is a volatile and symbolic 
issue quebecs french speakers 81 percent of the population 
consider essential to preserving their linguistic and cultural 
heritage 
bourassas plan prohibits languages other than french on signs 
both outdoors and in such places as shopping malls and interiors of 
public transportation facilities 
an editorial tuesday in the globe and mail of toronto said 
what now almost certainly a hardening of hearts a less 
generous attitude an unwillingness to spend precious political 
capital on bilingualism and francophones tougher questioning of the 
primordiality granted to quebecs concerns in sum a quiet 
unspectacular but undeniable backlash that will do us all no good 
la presse a widely read montreal daily said bourassa chose 
the best compromise under the circumstances it said either 
continuing the ban on any language other than french or allowing 
bilingual signs everywhere would have been to scorn quebec 
reality both historic and present 
in 1985 bourassa campaigned for election on a platform that 
included easing language restrictions on signs critics say he could 
have avoided angering militants if he had acted soon after the 
election instead of responding to a court ruling three years later 
a crowd of 10000 or more attended a rally sunday in montreal 
demanding no changes in the language law which was passed in 1977 
by the separatist parti quebecois gpverment 
power in the province shifted from the englishspeaking minority 
to the french speakers in the 1970s separatist sentiment abated 
after the language law was passed and quebecs voters rejected a 
sovereignty in a 1980 referendum

overwhelmingly last month after the most expensive campaign in ohio 
history gave his campaign manager a 50000 electionday bonus 
federal disclosure reports showed tuesday 
federal election commission records show the ohio democrat 
rewarded his campaign staff with more than 80000 in bonuses in 
addition to their salaries 
all the money came from contributions from metzenbaum supporters 
metzenbaum fought off a wellfinanced challenge from cleveland 
mayor george voinovich together the two candidates spent more than 
16 million far exceeding the previous state record of 39 
million spent by ohio sen john glenn and gop challenger james betz 
in 1980 
metzenbaums campaign manager peter harris defended the bonus 
in an interview tuesday claiming his total compensation including 
the bonus was a little more than 71000 he compared his income to 
that of voinovichs campaign manager jim conrad 
his yeartodate salary was 103000 and change harris said 
of conrad i got 71000 and some change including the bonus 
vincent panichi treasurer for the voinovich campaign didnt 
dispute harris math but said the 103000 probably reflected money 
conrad earned from pre1988 campaign work as well as for his work in 
1988 
jim worked for 18 months for 103000 i dont think thats 
outrageous panichi said 
of course he was worth it said panichi who was calling from 
a car phone and was unable to verify immediately the amounts and 
dates in campaign records 
voinovichs fec records show no bonuses 
harris who has returned to his precampaign job of running 
metzenbaums senate staff said did i deserve 71000 the answer 
is yes people across the country said it was one of the two or 
three bestrun campaigns in the united states it was an 85 
million venture 
he said the money partly reimbursed him for what he would have 
earned had he remained on the senators government payroll as 
administrative assistant and partly reflected the going rate for 
managing large campaigns 
bob chlopak the former executive director of the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee said bigstate campaign managers are 
paid anywhere from 6000070000 on the low end to 100000plus 
on the high end the skys the limit 
add 50000 to that for the republican side he said 
in all voinovich spent about 8 million in his unsuccessful bid 
to unseat metzenbaum who spent about 85 million

the white house said tuesday that 150 million 
of unspent energy department funds can be used immediately to 
begin whatever work is necessary to improve the safety conditions 
at plants producing nuclear weapons 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked about a dec 9 
letter by energy secretary john s herrington saying that some 
plants might have to close because of a 360 million shortfall in 
funds needed for safety improvements 
white house chief of staff kenneth n duberstein disagreed with 
herringtons assessment in an interview on nbctvs meet the 
press program sunday saying the necessary money had been found in 
unobligated funds of the department 
fitzwater said the issue had been resolved in the budget for the 
1990 fiscal year beginning next oct 1 that president reagan will 
submit to congress on jan 9 
the budget will include 900 million in new money for safety 
environmental cleanup and building of new facilities as it relates 
to nuclear processing plants fitzwater said 
he said the energy department asked for a supplemental 
appropriation of 360 million for the current fiscal year and it 
was our judgment that that would be basically too little too late in 
the sense that we dont have any plans for a supplemental at this 
point 
even if we did it would be september or october and 
therefore what we suggested was that money be transferred out of 
900 million in unobligated balances that exist from fiscal 89 
he said 
and so that will be 150 million that can be used immediately 
to begin whatever work is necessary to improve the safety conditions 
at these plants 
fitzwater also said i repeat the presidents statement that no 
plant will be operated until its safe and thats why we thought it 
was crucial to get this money on the project early and the 
supplemental is not a good way to go

president reagan and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev are expected to exchange televised greetings on new 
years day for the third time the white house announced tuesday 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan taped his message last 
week and gorbachev is expected to submit a taped message to us 
networks for their consideration soon 
the exchanges began in 1986 a few months after reagan and 
gorbachev held their first summit meeting in geneva 
the soviets declined to take part in 1987 saying ussoviet 
relations were not good enough to justify such an exchange reagan 
broadcast a radio message over the voice of america but it was 
jammed in the soviet union 
the exchange was resumed in 1988 
fitzwater said the presidents message doesnt deal with policy 
issues

prisoners lopez contreras told a news conference tuesday

laws and sovereignty we will continue efforts to release all the 
prisoners in contra hands

in squalid camps in southern honduras since 1979 when the 
sandinistas overthrew proamerican rightist dictator anastasio 
somoza

in recent months however some hondurans complained of rowdiness by 
rebels and pressured the government to expel them

the us energy department will negotiate 
with the state to reach a legally binding agreement to clean up a 
federally owned uranium processing plant a spokesman said tuesday 
the decision was made late tuesday said douglas elmets a 
spokesman for the department in washington a day earlier he had 
said federal officials were still considering whether the agreement 
should be in the form of a consent decree that would be enforceable 
through federal courts 
news reports indicating that the energy department was backing 
away from a consent decree had prompted state attorney general 
anthony celebrezze to insist that ohio had a commitment that federal 
officials should honor 
when state officials announced a 50 million federal agreement on 
nov 22 to clean up the portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant at 
piketon in southern ohio they said it could serve as a model for 
dealing with contamination at nuclear weapons plants around the 
country 
elmets said the department reached its decision after discussions 
with ohio officials and consultations with the justice department 
and the energy departments operations office in oak ridge tenn 
this decision was based on the same factors that influenced our 
decision on two earlier consent decrees in regard to fernald 
litigation elmets read from a prepared statement 
he was referring to the announcement earlier this month of a 
courtapproved agreement that gave ohio authority to regulate the 
energy departments cleanup of the feed materials production center 
a weaponsgrade uranium processing plant in fernald 18 miles 
northwest of cincinnati 
we analyze the specific facts of each case and litigation risks 
involved and the overriding consideration in all these cases was 
the attractive settlement proposals which were fair to both sides 
and made pursuing litigation unwise elmets said 
gov richard celeste and celebrezze were not immediately 
available tuesday night to comment on the energy departments 
decision 
earlier celebrezze had expressed dissatisfaction with what 
seemed to be a federal reversal of its promise to negotiate toward a 
legally binding agreement 
this is not atypical of the federal government but we have a 
commitment from them and we expect them to keep it he said i 
will accept nothing less than a consent decree 
elmets said the decision tuesday does not mean the energy 
department will pursue similar agreements with other states that 
claim its nuclear facilities have polluted the environment 
he also would not discuss details of any proposals put forth by 
the state 
the piketon plant processes uranium for fuel for commercial 
nuclear power reactors it generates toxic wastes such as 
polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs solvents and metals as well as 
radioactive materials 
piketon site manager eugene gillespie an energy department 
employee said some of the cleanup work that is included in the 
agreement began dec 1 and plans for further action have been 
submitted to the ohio environmental protection agency which is to 
supervise the cleanup of about 6 million pounds of waste

the rightwing likud blocs delegates narrowly 
approved a coalition agreement with the leftleaning labor party 
early wednesday another step toward formation of the next israeli 
government israeli radio said 
the agreement still needs approval by the labor partys 
1200member central committee which planned to meet for a vote 
wednesday afternoon if labor approves the national unity 
government could be presented to the knesset or parliament on 
thursday 
guidelines of the new government ban talks with the plo setting 
israel on a collision course with the united states 
the new government will be remarkably similar to the outgoing 
national unity government except that prime minister yitzhak 
shamir the likud leader will be prime minister throughout the 
fouryear term in the previous term labor leader shimon peres the 
current foreign minister was premier for the first two years 
likud delegates voted in a secret ballot tuesday night after a 
stormy meeting in which opponents led by ariel sharon likuds 
former defense minister fought a last ditch effort to overturn it 
israeli radio said 796 delegates or 55 percent voted for the 
agreement and 642 delegates or 444 percent voted against the 
final tally was reported just after 3 am wednesday 8 pm est 
tuesday 
sharon told the delegates who met in tel aviv that labor was an 
unfit partner because it favored withdrawal from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip and some of its members approved of talking to 
the palestine liberation organization 
israel views the plo as a terrorist group 
shamir told the delegates that if the party did not approve the 
agreement at the meeting he would go to president chaim herzog and 
give up the mandate he was given to form a new government such a 
move would throw israels political system into a state of confusion 
herzog had given shamir whose party slightly edged out labor in 
nov 1 elections until dec 26 to form a new government 
labor cabinet ministers meanwhile approved the coalition pact 
tuesday the agreement will be submitted wednesday to the partys 
1000member central committee 
peres said formation of the new coalition would spell defeat for 
the proposed who is a jew legislation that was vehemently 
opposed by us jews 
that prospect touched off wrangling between shamir and the four 
religious parties who originally demanded the legislation and now 
threaten to stay out of the coalition 
shamir hopes to include the religious parties to make it more 
difficult for labor to bring down the government should an impasse 
occur 
yitzhak peretz of the ultraorthodox shas party accused shamir of 
breaking his pledges he promised us and signed an agreement to 
help change the law of return he said 
the law of return grants automatic israeli citizenship to all 
jews and the amendment would require orthodox approval of all 
conversions to judaism us jews feel the legislation will divide 
the jewish community 
shamir said labor and likud were united in standing up to the 
common danger arab demands for creation of an independent 
palestinan state 
there is a common danger to all of us the establishment of a 
palestinian state both labor and likud see it as a danger and the 
government will deal with it in a unified effort he said 
although fear of too much influence by the religious parties had 
already sparked public support for another unity government the 
latest agreement also was spurred by the us decision last week to 
open a dialogue with the plo shamir aides said they wanted to 
present a unified front against the move by their greatest ally 
peres told reporters the new government guidelines mean there 
will be no negotiations with the plo 
the decision to ban talks with the plo puts israel increasingly 
out of step with the rest of the international community and could 
strain relations with washington which provides 3 billion a year 
in economic and military aid to the jewish state 
israeli officials said the new government would give top priority 
in the next two months to devising a peace formula that will be an 
acceptable alternative to dealing with the plo 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
guidelines call for talks based on the 1978 camp david accords which 
envision limited autonomy for palestinians and the participation of 
jordan in the peace process 
there will be few new faces in the new government labor and 
likud will each control 10 seats in the cabinet which will have a 
total of 24 or 25 members key policy decisions however will be 
made by shamir peres labors defense minister yitzhak rabin and 
likuds foreign minister moshe arens a close shamir ally and former 
ambassador to the united states 
peres will become finance minister a post labor officials urged 
him to take in order to help debtridden party institutions such as 
the histradrut trade union federation and the kibbutz movement of 
communal farms 
the institutions form the backbone of the labor party and are 
crucial to its support

the stepson of a newspaper executive was found 
guilty tuesday of trying to murder his girlfriend after she rebuffed 
his marriage proposal the shooting left her paralyzed for life 
jurors rejected bradley ackermans defense that he was crazed by 
drugs and intent only on suicide when he shot 23yearold julie 
alban whom he had dated for nearly 10 months as she lay sleeping 
in her parents home june 8 
ackerman 24 then turned the gun on himself but he recovered 
from his wounds 
the tragedy involved families who lived across the street from 
each other and youngsters raised in a world of wealth and privilege 
ackerman is the stepson of daniel ridder chairman of the long beach 
presstelegram miss alban is the daughter of a prominent orthopedic 
surgeon 
ackerman showed no emotion as the verdict was read in a packed 
courtroom ridder who sat in a frontrow seat was grimfaced as it 
was announced and rushed from the courtroom without comment 
jurors found ackerman guilty of willful premeditated attempted 
firstdegree murder they further found that he used a gun illegally 
and intentionally inflicted great bodily harm on miss alban who 
testified from a wheelchair 
superior court judge jd smith said he considered ackerman a 
suicide risk and ordered him held in the hospital section of the 
county jail sentencing was set for feb 6 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney kenneth lamb said the 
only sentence possible on ackermans attempted murder conviction is 
life in prison with the possibility of parole an additional 
fiveyear sentence is possible on the two gunrelated charges he 
said 
prosecutors said miss alban had spurned ackermans marriage 
proposal just hours before the shooting 
there can never be justice for me miss alban told knbctv 
after learning of the verdict im going to be in a wheelchair the 
rest of my life battling complications brad may be out in 
10 years 
it was clearly a justified verdict said lamb no matter 
what happens to bradley ackerman his sentence to julie was death 
and failing that he sentenced her to life in a wheelchair 
but ackermans lawyer anthony murray said the verdict was 
decided emotionally not on the facts 
this was an extremely emotional jury he said the 
courtroom was charged with emotion when the little girl miss 
alban came in to testify they couldnt focus on the facts 
ackerman claimed he was in a valiuminduced stupor when he shot 
miss alban with a single bullet to the back paralyzing her below 
the waist 
his lawyer argued that the young man had taken 30 pills in an 
attempt to kill himself out of depression over a 30000 gambling 
debt and his failure to fulfill his early promise as a tennis player 
ackerman testified he did not remember shooting miss alban she 
testified that she was awakened by a bullet ripping into her spine 
then dragged herself to a telephone and called for help 
lamb told jurors that ackermans precision in firing the 
38caliber revolver showed he was not suffering from a valium 
blackout 
he portrayed ackerman as a rejected suitor a selfish 
irresponsible man who invented the blackout defense to escape 
responsibility for his action

happy birthday to you is not just a tune 
to warble on the appropriate occasions its a solid investment with 
good profit potential says an official of the company thats buying 
it 
geoffrey holmes senior vice president of warner communications 
tuesday confirmed a report that the giant entertainment company was 
buying the birthday song and the new jersey publishing company that 
owns it but he wouldnt confirm the reported price 25 million 
this is a business deal holmes said were approaching 
this whole thing in that its a very attractive deal to them and to 
us if it wasnt economical we certainly wouldnt do it 
the new york times reported tuesday that warner chappell a 
division of warner communications will pay 25 million for 
birchtree ltd of princeton the newspaper cited an unidentified 
executive familiar with the negotiations birchtree spokeswoman kate 
shen also confirmed that warner chappell which is the worlds 
largest music publisher was buying the familyowned birchtree but 
like holmes she wouldnt confirm the reported price tag 
its agreed to but its not closed ms shen said the 
song should be warners by the end of the year 
holmes would not say what the return on happy birthday has 
been but it is believed to be about 1 million a year the company 
plans to boost revenues from the song by increasing marketing he 
said 
holmes said the company likes the idea of owning a classic but 
he stressed that warner is not buying the song for prestige or 
sentimental reasons 
we think there are a lot of opportunities to further exploit 
the song holmes said we think we can further enhance the 
songs royalties 
the birthday staple and the company were put on the block in 
october because birchtree lacked the resources to monitor and 
protect copyrights said birchtree chairman david sengstack whose 
family owns the company a copyright issued on the song in 1935 
expires in 2010 
warner chappell has a large operation to protect copyrights 
that is make sure people who use the songs for profit pay royalties 
and would be able to reduce costs of protecting happy birthday 
and other birchtree songs holmes said 
warner chappell already owns the rights to songs by george and 
ira gershwin michael jackson and cole porter among others 
altogether birchtree owns 50000 titles of which about 1700 
are actively collecting royalty fees spokesmen said that compared 
with happy birthday to you the other titles are obscure 
the song began as a classroom greeting in 1893 penned by two 
schoolteacher sisters from louisville ky patty smith hill and 
mildred j hill the birthday lyrics were added later 
since then it has become one of the three most frequently sung 
songs in the english language along with auld lang syne and 
for hes a jolly good fellow according to the guinness book of 
world records 
birchtree also owns the suzuki methods an instrumental 
instruction method for violin cell and viola 
happy birthday and birchtree are to be only the latest of 
warners expanding music publishing business last year it spent 
about 275 million to by chappell amp company which was privately 
owned

antiabortion groups many already suspicious 
of george bushs commitment to their cause have bombarded the bush 
camp with objections to the possible appointment of louis sullivan 
as secretary of health and human services 
a report quoting the atlanta educators sentiments on abortion 
created a furor among conservatives and anxiety about what one 
group called a slap in the face to the millions of antiabortion 
voters 
sullivan president of the morehouse school of medicine told 
bush in an interview last week that if appointed he would support 
the presidentelects antiabortion campaign positions according to 
bushs press secretary sheila tate 
but concern flared anew said jack fowler washington chief of 
the ad hoc committee in defense of life when the atlanta journal 
and constitution quoted him sunday as saying he supported a womens 
right to abortion though he opposed federal funding 
transition sources have said for many days that sullivan was the 
frontrunner for the health and human services post but that bush 
had not formally offered him the job a bush transition spokesman 
david prosperi said tuesday that sullivan was still under 
consideration 
our discussions with dr sullivan have been very 
encouraging transition team leader craig fuller told cbs news 
we feel he is a very strong candidate i think wed like to go 
forward with him and i think were pretty close to that 
a statement from fowlers group said sullivans appointment would 
be a slap in the face to conservatives and would continue the 
obstructionist tactics proabortion hhs secretary otis bown has 
employed against antiabortionists 
generally among the various conservative and righttolife 
groups in town there is confusion and thus concern about his 
possible appointment said gary bauer who was former white house 
domestic policy adviser to president reagan and now heads the 
private family research council 
bauer said such an appointment would be politically stupid 
because it would alienate a constituency that supported bush in the 
campaign 
he said his group and others have told bush transition officials 
of their great discomfort at the thought of having sullivan in 
the cabinet 
rep bob dornan rcalif said abortion was the one issue about 
which he was distrustful of bush before he decided to endorse 
the vice presidents presidential candidacy 
bush satisfied dornan that his position was in line with the 
conservative stance but dornan said tuesday that bush will rue 
the day he picks sullivan 
bush has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest 
or danger to the mothers life he supports a constitutional 
amendment to make abortion illegal and opposes federal funding for 
abortion 
sullivan echoed those positions in a dec 18 letter that was 
being circulated to conservative groups and was published in 
wednesdays editions of the atlanta constitution the letter said 
i am writing to clarify my position on abortion i am opposed to 
abortion except in cases of rape incest and where the life of the 
mother is threatened my position on abortion is entirely 
consistent with presidentelect george bushs position 
sullivan did not return reporters calls 
transition officials denied suggestions that the 
sullivanabortion issue caused the sudden cancellation of cabinet 
announcements tuesday 
transition personnel director chase untermeyer told reporters the 
abortion issue is important and that i am confident that whoever 
is the nominee is certain to conform 
the conservatives fear another secretary like reagan appointee 
otis bowen who they say has supported reagans antiabortion views 
in word only 
we need an advocate for the preborn not a yes man who 
undermines everything from behind the scenes said dornan 
sullivans statement lining up with bushs positions did not 
satisfy the national right to life committee which last week wrote 
to bush objecting to sullivan 
the groups president john willke said in a statement that even 
though sullivan may pledge to carry out the bush agenda only a 
person who shares presidentelect bushs prolife ethic and 
convictions can make genuinely prolife decisions on the hundreds of 
daytoday matters which cannot all be referred to the president 
another aspect of the abortion issue that conservatives consider 
anathema is the use of fetal tissue for research the atlanta 
newspaper quoted sullivan as supporting that practice and saying 
we have a number of medical advances that have occurred as a 
result of research with fetal tissue that have benefited the lives 
of many people 
transition spokesman prosperi said he did not know bushs 
position on that issue

george bushs aides scrambled tuesday to 
contain a sudden outburst over the abortion views of louis w 
sullivan an atlanta educator who is the leading contender for 
health and human services secretary 
the presidentelect did announce two other appointments former 
nevada sen paul laxalt and former ohio rep thomas l ashley to the 
national economic commission but did so in writing and didnt face 
reporters questions about sullivan 
he canceled a session to name additional cabinet choices 
prochoice abortion remarks attributed to sullivan president of 
the morehouse school of medicine brought protests from 
antiabortion groups and threw up an obstacle to his selection as 
hhs chief bush transition and congressional sources said 
transition officials stressing privately that bush had not 
formally offered sullivan the post denied publicly that his remarks 
over the weekend in an interview with the atlanta journal and 
constitution had caused any delay in announcing new cabinet chiefs 
the officials said sullivan remains the top candidate for health 
and human services 
our discussions with dr sullivan have been very 
encouraging transition leader craig fuller told cbs news we 
feel he is a very strong candidate i think wed like to go forward 
with him and i think were pretty close to that fuller also told 
nbc hes met with the vice president hes explained his views 
and dr sullivan and george bush i believe see eyetoeye on the 
question of abortion 
in the interview sullivan said he supports the right of a woman 
to seek an abortion while opposing the use of federal funds to pay 
for it 
that appeared to be at odds with a statement issued last week by 
transition officials after a meeting between bush and sullivan 
suggesting the medical school official had assured bush he shared 
the vice presidents antiabortion views 
if appointed sullivan would be the first black named to bushs 
cabinet 
bush himself took no questions during a picturetaking session at 
a meeting with business leaders at which he promised anew not to 
raise taxes 
in a statement appointing laxalt a republican and ashley a 
democrat to the 14member national economic commission bush 
praised both as having long and distinguished careers 
the panel named by congress in the aftermath of the october 1987 
stock market plunge is striving to find a bipartisan way to 
eliminate the federal budget deficit 
laxalt is a former governor of nevada close friend of president 
reagan and former general chairman of the republican national 
committee ashley former senior democrat on the house banking 
committee is a longtime friend of bushs and a former college 
classmate at yale 
as for cabinet appointments sheila tate bushs spokeswoman 
said theres no connection between lack of an announcement and 
the hhs situation 
she said bush and sullivan had discussed abortion and sullivan 
indicated that if he were nominated he would support the vice 
presidents position 
in any event the delay meant yet another trip to washington for 
chicago transit official samuel skinner bushs apparent choice for 
transportation secretary 
to announce skinners appointment alone might have subjected bush 
to questioning on the abortion controversy an issue he did not want 
to get into while the hhs appointment was still up in the air the 
sources said 
skinner chairman of the northeastern illinois mass transit 
authority was summoned to washington last week by transition 
officials for an expected announcment that was then postponed by 
bush 
he returned to chicago for the weekend then was summoned back on 
monday then told by transition officials his appointment would come 
on tuesday 
sources earlier said that bush had planned to announce skinners 
appointment as transportation secretary on monday and would likely 
couple it with the selection of the first black in his cabinet 
either sullivan or julius w becton jr a threestar retired army 
general reportedly in line for secretary of veterans affairs 
the atlanta constitution reported tuesday that sullivan had said 
monday evening he was having trouble getting calls to the white 
house returned 
i have simply concluded that as a result of my not receiving a 
call back the things have been put off and hopefully its not 
anything worse than that 
sullivan told the newspaper his prochoice stand on abortion is a 
private view and he does not intend to disagree publicly with bushs 
antiabortion views 
he said he believes there should be that right to abortions 
at the same time i am aware of the fact that the 
presidentelect feels that that should not be the case and i would 
have to as secretary should i be appointed carry out his 
policies 
sullivans congressional supporters on tuesday were circulating 
among antiabortion leaders a letter in which he said i am 
opposed to abortion except in cases of rape incest and where the 
life of the mother is threatened my position on abortion is 
entirely consistent with presidentelect george bushs postion 
the letter also was published in wednesdays editions of the atlanta 
constitution 
however gary bauer who was president reagans domestic policy 
adviser and now heads the private family research council said the 
possibility of a sullivan appointment had caused great 
discomfort among conservatives and they have made that known to 
bush transition officials 
sullivans office in atlanta referred all calls tuesday to the 
vice presidents office 
chase untermeyer the transition personnel director asked if 
abortion views were a litmus test for the appointee said 
its quite important i am confident that whoever is the 
nominee is certain to conform with the presidents philosophy 
he commented at a briefing by transition officials sponsored by 
the national press foundation 
meanwhile a reagan administration source said patricia diaz 
dennis a member of the federal communications commission appeared 
to be fast emerging as the no 1 contender for the post of labor 
secretary 
ms dennis a former member of the national labor relations 
board has wide support among top bush transition officials 
according to the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
bush has yet to name a woman to a cabinet post although he has 
selected washington lawyer carla hills to be his chief trade 
negotiator a job that has cabinetlevel status

maoist rebels cut transportation to a 
trickle tuesday and shut down nearly all schools and offices in this 
important highland city in a general strike which they threatened to 
enforce with weapons 
scores of police and soldiers patrolled huancayos nearly empty 
streets but no reports emerged of violence or other guerrilla 
activity 
it was the second socalled armed strike declared by the 
shining path guerrillas in recent weeks they paralyzed ayacucho 
their stronghold about 100 miles southeast of huancayo for a week 
in late november with a similar strike 
the rebels called the threeday strike in huancayo 125 miles 
east of lima on monday 
the state government was quoted as saying tuesdays strike had no 
impact abilio fernandez the chief administrative officer of junin 
state said activity was normal throughout the state according to a 
dispatch by the state news agency andina 
however reporters for the associated press and other media said 
nearly everyone stayed indoors apparently in fear of guerrilla 
reprisals 
the strike came a day after favio llerena deputy to fernandez 
said dozens of smalltown mayors and farming hamlet officials across 
the state resigned after receiving death threats by the rebel group 
for two years huancayo and the surrounding mantaro river valley 
an important mining and agricultural area have been targets of the 
shining path insurgency to topple perus elected government and 
install a marxist state 
officials say the violence is part of the guerrillas overall 
goal of weakening peru by fomenting political and economic chaos to 
pave the way for the rebels to seize power 
the mantaro valley is practically taken over by the shining 
path and there seems to be no way to defend it former industry 
minister guillermo arteaga said over the weekend 
authorities declared a state of emergency throughout junin a 
month ago as attacks increased dramatically on villages power 
installations railroads bridges and large cooperative farms 
parts of eight states with more than half the nations 21 million 
people are under emergency measures that give the military 
wideranging powers to police and govern the capital lima is 
under the regulations 
the government says the shining path insurgency has claimed more 
than 12000 lives and caused damage of more than 10 billion four 
times the amount of the nations yearly exports

credit playwright charles fuller with setting up 
an ambitious project for himself a cycle of five plays dealing 
with the black experience in the united states from the civil war to 
the turn of the century 
but his ambitions have gotten the best of him at least in the 
first two of these historical dramas called sally and 
prince which arrived over the weekend at offbroadways negro 
ensemble company 
the plays both set during the civil war are sketchy historical 
melodramas long on plot and short on poetry or power they 
reiterate the same themes particularly about freedom or the lack of 
it for blacks first under the slavemasters of the old south and 
then under the economic overlords of the north the plays say they 
traded one serfdom for another 
the subject is discussed early on in sally which had its 
world premiere last summer in atlanta at the national black arts 
festival despite its title the play deals mostly with a group of 
black union soldiers who are forced to take a pay cut and earn less 
than their white counterparts 
some are defiant and pay the price with their lives others 
accept it and pay a different kind of penalty one who acquiesces is 
prince logan an ambitious black soldier who is the most interesting 
character in both plays his dilemma to follow the army or revel 
in his newly won freedom merits most of your attention 
it is princes survival that fuller chronicles in these two 
dramas and i suspect the man will turn up in other plays in this 
series you dont need to see both of the first two dramas to 
understand his character but it helps samuel l jacksons 
persuasive even noble performance as prince also helps its a 
portrayal that deepens in the second play as fuller tries to deal 
with the dislocation and disorientation of the newly freed slaves 
these intentions get sidetracked by a lot of peripheral events 
directed by douglas turner ward and acted by the rest of the large 
cast at a feverish pace there are plenty of gunshots a stabbing or 
two and some heavyhanded attempts at sexual humor the dialogue is 
often flat more concerned with recounting events than illuminating 
character 
consider the first play the weaker of the two evenings of drama 
although she is the title character sally remains the most elusive 
person on stage tragic things happen to her her husband is 
poisoned her son is killed by rebel troops her affair with prince 
ends malevolently but throughout her troubles we never get to 
know the woman michelle shay a fine actress is stymied by the 
underwritten role 
another good performer hattie winston has a better time of it 
in prince where she plays lu an indominable camp follower who 
also manages to live and profit through the war 
in prince the focus switches from military to civilian the 
exslaves who have to work the cotton fields for new masters from 
the north these new employers a church group formed to help 
exslaves may seem more benevolent at first but their rule 
becomes just as tyrannical 
the action takes place on a gray utilitarian setting by charles 
mcclennahan its simple but effective allowing the fastmoving 
action to unfold quickly and with a minimum of fuss 
in many ways fullers plays tackle the same themes as august 
wilsons joe turners come and gone the story of exslaves 
coming to terms with their past wilsons drama contains some 
haunting and painful but strangely beautiful images sally and 
prince paint much more literal pictures well have to wait for 
the next three plays to see if fullers vision is more fully 
realized

plo chairman yasser arafat said tuesday he 
believes an independent palestinian state can be established within 
two years in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
in comments on austrian radio arafat expressed caution when 
asked about creating a palestinian governmentinexile 
we have to think what the israeli reaction will be he said 
some of those people designated members of a governmentinexile 
live in the occupied territories how would israel treat these 
people would they arrest them would they expel them 
asked when a palestinian state could be set up arafat replied 
we think within two years perhaps something less 
at a news conference later the leader of the palestine 
liberation organization reaffirmed his organizations commitment to 
middle east peace but vowed that the yearold palestinian uprising 
against israel will continue 
we have definite reports that the israeli leadership is bent on 
perpetrating yet more crimes and terrorist operations in order to 
torpedo the process of peace arafat charged 
he angrily rejected any questioning of the sincerity of the plo 
peace initiative with leaders of his own organization threatening 
sabotage 
whatever i have said in geneva was done on the basis of a 
resolution passed by the plo executive committee as well as on the 
basis of a resolution passed by the palestine national council 
which took place in a democratic atmosphere and by majority vote 
he said 
but a senior palestinian source speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said plo hardliners backed by syria met in damascus on 
tuesday to discuss ways to scuttle arafats initiative and oust him 
from leadership 
mustafa elzibri a member of the plo governing body on monday 
reflected a possible serious split in top ranks by calling arafats 
recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism arafats 
personal opinion 
over the weekend salah khalaf secondincommand of arafats own 
fatah faction declared president reagan may stop his 
governments dialogue with the plo now if he thinks he will be able 
to stop our attacks against israeli military targets 
the plo is an umbrella for several palestinian factions which 
often feud among themselves plo factions have launched attacks on 
israel without arafats approval other groups do not belong to the 
organization arafat has said he cannot guarantee that every 
palestinian group will refrain from terrorism 
he spoke before leaving vienna to take his campaign for an 
international conference on the middle east to yugoslavia 
apparently hoping to win support from a leading ally in the 
nonaligned movement 
his european trip also included visits in the past week to east 
germany and romania the plo says he also plans to go to greece 
italy spain and france 
the visits follow washingtons recent reversal of its 13year 
boycott of the plo 
at plo headquarters in tunis on tuesday executive committee 
member yasser abdrabboo said indirect contacts with the us 
government began in march when washington relayed conditions for the 
plo to meet before it would open formal talks 
the two traded counterproposals for months he said 
they seemed a prelude to the intense diplomatic maneuvering 
through swedish intermediaries that led to the plos meeting us 
conditions last week and to the first talks with the organization 
abdrabboo took part in the first meeting friday with us 
ambassador robert pelletreau jr 
he said messages relayed through americans of palestinian 
heritage followed the failure of secretary of state george shultz to 
find any notable palestinians to speak with on a visit to arab east 
jerusalem early this year 
they gave signals that the american administration after 
shultz had failed to find an alternative to the plo was thinking 
in a new way to deal with the plo directly he said

the problems of the homeless are so severe that 
drastic action including civil disobedience is sometimes necessary 
activists testified tuesday at a hearing for a colleague charged 
with trespassing 
people are freezing to death families are breaking down and 
children are being exposed to drug and alcohol addicts because 
society fails to take care of the homeless said mary ann gleason a 
member of the board of directors of the national coalition for the 
homeless 
gleason who also heads a denver medical clinic for homeless 
people was one of three witnesses who testified tuesday at a 
hearing for dorothy king who operates a shelter for homeless women 
and children 
king took 14 women and 26 children from her shelter to a vacant 
house owned by the federal department of housing and urban 
development on aug 15 in an attempt to draw attention to the plight 
of the homeless 
when she refused an order to leave king was arrested and charged 
with trespassing the other women and children obeyed the order 
kings trial was scheduled to begin wednesday in denver county 
court tuesdays hearing before judge raymond n sater was on 
several pretrial motions 
sater did not rule immediately on the issues raised at the 
hearing including whether he would allow king to use the socalled 
choiceofevils defense kings attorneys said they would argue that 
trespassing was necessary to prevent the greater evil of leaving the 
women and children on the streets 
since kings protest hud has rented 49 denverarea homes to the 
homeless the site of the august protest and the other homes that 
hud has since rented out were obtained by the federal agency 
through foreclosure proceedings when buyers who used federally 
backed mortgages defaulted 
gleason testified tuesday that families make up a growing 
percentage of the homeless people in the denver area 
on any given night there are 500 children in denver who are 
homeless she said she also said a recent study found 1100 
shelter beds in the denver area and roughly 2100 to 2600 people 
competing for them 
last week she said two homeless men were brutally murdered and 
people have frozen to death on denvers streets she said it is 
justified to occupy a home illegally because civil disobedience is 
a form of public education 
another witness gloria roybal who has been homeless since may 
tearfully told the court how she and her three grandchildren lived 
in a park last summer she said she slept during the day so she 
could stay awake at night watching over the children age 3 4 and 
8 
marsha gould of the colorado childrens campaign said a recent 
study in colorado showed children are suffering because of a lack of 
attention to the problem of homeless families 
were seeing a lot of anxiety clinging behavior in kids 
arguments school disruption sleep disturbance eating disturbance 
and a lot of anxiety and depression in parents because theyre 
unable to care for their children she said

the indiana supreme court on tuesday threw 
out the convictions of a habitual offender who was sentenced to 32 
years in prison after he tried to get a refund for an electric razor 
without a receipt 
the court in a 41 decision struck down the attempted theft and 
habitual criminal convictions of richard allen smith of indianapolis 
and ordered smith discharged from indiana state prison 
smith 49 was sentenced to two years in prison in 1985 for 
attempting to get a refund for a 4296 remington razor at three 
indiana stores under the states habitual offender law a fixed 
term of 30 years was added to the sentence because of smiths 
earlier convictions on auto banditry and drug charges 
prosecutors argued at his circuit court trial that smith 
attempted to exert unauthorized control over one stores profit 
margin by creating the false impression he had purchased the razor 
there 
however the supreme court concluded that in order to prove smith 
was trying to create a false impression the state needed to prove 
smith hadnt purchased the razor at the store there was no evidence 
to demonstrate where the razor was purchased the court said 
without that crucial element of proof every citizen engaging 
in a simple refund transaction would risk criminal penalties 
chief justice randall t shepard wrote for the court some 
citizens such as those seeking to return gifts simply do not know 
where the item was originally purchased 
court records show that in november 1978 smith took the razor to 
a hooks drug store in mooresville and later to a hooks in 
martinsville to get a refund the package had a hooks price tag on 
it but employees refused to give smith a refund because of a store 
policy requiring receipts for returned merchandise 
he then went to a danners store in martinsville and presented 
the razor without a price tag for a refund hooks employees 
suspicious about smiths behavior had alerted danners employees of 
his earlier attempts to get a refund 
employees at the danners store called police when smith showed 
up and stalled until police arrived to arrest smith court records 
show danners also would have denied a refund under its noreceipt 
norefund policy 
the long gap between his arrest and final sentencing occurred 
because smith left the courtroom during his trial and remained at 
large for four years according to court records

japan and the soviet union will continue efforts to 
negotiate a formal end to their world war ii hostilities soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said wednesday a day after 
territorial talks broke down 
japanese officials indicated that all hope of a compromise 
vanished in tuesdays negotiations about the kuril islands north of 
japan which japan claims soviet troops occupied them in the last 
days of world war ii and they have remained the major roadblock to 
an official end to hostilities 
however shevardnadze said wednesday the two sides will pick up 
where they left off in 1973 to negotiate a peace treaty officially 
ending the war 
shevardnadze speaking to a news conference shortly before 
departing for the philippines said his talks with japanese leaders 
had brought a very important agreement on a mechanism and rough 
schedule of meetings to deal with thorny issues now over four 
decades old 
the soviet official gave a more positive assessment of his two 
days of talks with japanese foreign minister sousuke uno than 
japanese officials gave the night before one japanese official 
described the talks as heated and said neither side had changed 
its position on the territorial dispute 
uno was to give a news conference later wednesday after 
shevardnadzes departure and a joint communique was to be released 
then 
shevardnadze agreed that no major progress was achieved but he 
cited progress in agreements on further meetings leading to a 
possible summit between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita 
he also said the negotiations had won a victory for reason for 
balance of interests and for a realistic policy 
we have obtained a degree of mutual understanding that allows 
us to speak of a new chapter in japansoviet relations he said 
speaking in russian that was translated into english 
the kiril dispute has also blocked progress in diplomatic and 
economic matters between the two countries on tuesday the japanese 
brushed off soviet overtures for economic cooperation the kyodo 
news service reported 
the talks in tokyo were the first between foreign ministers in 
nearly three years 
foreign ministry spokesman seiichi kondo said little progress was 
achieved in the discussions which he described as heated neither 
side has shown concessions so the positions are still far apart 
he said 
also tuesday japan refused to conclude two agreements one on 
bilateral investment guarantees and another on trade and economic 
cooperation the agency said quoting government sources it did not 
name 
the ministers signed agreements on cultural exchanges and 
protection of 287 species of migratory birds 
earlier tuesday shevardnadze delivered a letter from gorbachev 
to takeshita the newspaper asahi said gorbachev invited takeshita 
to moscow and said he would like to visit japan 
shevardnadze said wednesday the tentative agenda for a 
japansoviet summit would include agreements to protect investment 
principles of economic cooperation and establishment of banking 
offices as well as treaty issues and other matters 
shevardnadze said moscow had established trade and other 
unofficial relations with south korea but would not establish 
governmental relations with seoul the soviets are north koreas 
ally and moscows growing ties with seoul have tended to further 
isolate pyongyang 
the soviet foreign minister left for the philippines from where 
he is scheduled to travel to north korea

ranking generals resigned tuesday following opposition charges that 
the army commander made a deal with military rebels to end their 
fourday revolt this month 
the resignations appeared to be concessions to the mutineers and 
pose military and political problems for president raul alfonsin as 
his party campaigns for may 14 presidential elections 
alfonsin made no immediate public comment but was expected to 
accept the resignations of lt gen jose dante caridi the army 
commander and gens miguel abbate and enrique bianchi 
caridi met with alfonsin for 1 hours before announcing his 
decision the state news agency telam said in a terse statement on 
the resignations it gave no reasons or details for the resignations 
alfonsin is to address the argentine congress on wednesday in a 
special session focusing the dec 14 military insurrection the 
third uprising in 20 months 
rebels led by army col mohamed ali seineldin demanded all the 
top generals go an increased military budget including bigger pay 
packets and an end to the prosecution of officers for human rights 
abuses committed during the 197683 military regime 
on dec 3 alfonsin ordered the army to suffocate the 
rebellion the next day he announced the mutineers surrendered 
unconditionally 
but political opponents noted at the time that loyal troops were 
reluctant to fight the rebels that the rebels were not immediately 
disarmed and that most mutineers were allowed to return to their 
units 
the opposition accused alfonsin or caridi of cutting a deal with 
the rebels 
alfonsin denied making any deal nevertheless a 20 percent pay 
increase was granted to soldiers along with a 100 bonus 
on saturday defense minister horacio jaunarena said in a speech 
that the socalled dirty war against leftist subversion in the 
late 1970s was necessary effectively endorsing the armys position 
and infuriating human rights groups 
while the army did fight pitched battles with peoples 
revolutionary army guerrillas the dirty war takes its name from 
the arrests disappearances and presumed killings of several 
thousand civilians alleged to be subversives 
caridi was alfonsins fourth army chief in five years his 
predecessor gen hector rios erenu departed after the first 
insurrection in april 1987 which also was sparked by the human 
rights trials 
the selection of caridis successor is delicate choosing an open 
supporter of seineldin the rebel leader would damage alfonsins 
credibility and the civilian governments claim that the military is 
subordinate to it 
already presidential candidate carlos menem of the opposition 
peronist party has said he would have fired caridi for making a deal 
with the rebels 
caridi may have paved the way for his departure by saying in a 
television interview last friday that the insurrection ended when he 
and seineldin spoke and realized that our aspirations coincided 
and so the question why confront one another to produce 
bloodshed if what they rebels were asking the army was trying to 
achieve caridi said 
he added that if rebels demands were not met there might soon 
be a fourth insurrection 
argentinas two main political parties repeatedly have said they 
would not allow congress to pass amnesty legislation to halt the 
human rights trials which are about to resume in civilian court 
after a years lapse

every once in a while some brave soul ventures 
forth to demand get rid of santa claus a chorus of protests 
inevitably results in various quarters religious and otherwise 
it has happened again this time the santasmashing thrust comes 
from a minister in kansas 
santa claus should be abolished from the celebration of 
christmas says the rev milton m miller pastor of first united 
methodist church in girard kan he should be discarded with last 
years gift wrappings 
after all its not his birthday but that of jesus miller says 
yet it is always santa claus who receives the most attention 
during the christmas season 
his face and portly figure appear on the majority of holiday 
decorations and greetings 
miller hoists his challenge in the united methodist reporter a 
national denominational weekly published in dallas declaring that 
santa has virtually become a god 
anything that takes the place of god is an idol he adds 
suggesting thats the kind of false substitute being worshipped at 
christmas 
furthermore he says it engenders some shoddy impulses in the 
young both selfishness for things and eventual disillusionment that 
the whole affair is unreal a fantasy perpetrated by adults 
santa claus inspires greed miller says we all have seen 
little children pushing and shoving in line preparing to tell santa 
what they want 
i have witnessed the sanctuary of a church turn into a madhouse 
because of the arrival of the man in the red suit as children and 
adults wait for their names to be called to receive their gifts 
besides that the santa myth is cloaked in untruths miller 
points out and the child eventually learns it was all a fake 
there should be no dishonesty associated with such a beautiful 
holiday jesus came to be the truth such a lovely story does not 
need to be surrounded by untruths 
the argument sometimes is made that santa is proper for the 
occasion because children need something they can see miller 
notes 
he says this is the same explanation given moses when he 
descended from mount sinai with the ten commandments and found the 
israelites worshipping the golden calf viz the people wanted 
something they could see 
miller adds the argument that santa claus is the spirit of 
love leads me to ask then where does that leave jesus isnt he 
the spirit of love 
as for reactions from millers congregation when he once put my 
foot down and ordered santa eliminated he says it was the adults 
not the children who complained 
children love the thought of the baby in the manger and they 
with wideeyued innocence love to worship him miller adds 
they dont need something to take his place 
nevertheless efforts to oust santa almost always have produced 
resistance and repercussions as was the case in the 1986 season 
when a roman catholic priest the rev romano ferraro told a 
childrens class santa didnt exist 
when asked by a fifthgrader at st john vianney church in 
colonia nj if that meant parents were liars ferraro said yes a 
parent reported the episode brought apologies from ferraros church 
superiors saying 
his zeal to emphasize the spiritual dimensions of the 
occasion unfortunately appeared to diminish the importance that 
many especially children attach to some of the cultural and 
secular aspects 
its a touchy issue with some church leaders deploring the 
extent to which santa diverts attention from jesus while others 
defend the santa myth so long the main emphasis is on jesuss birth 
in any case old and young generally treat santa as a charming 
fellow and lot of fun immune to stuffy analysis 
counter to millers call for ouster of santa another united 
methodist pastor the rev james campbell of davenport iowa writes 
in an earlier issue of the united methodist reporter 
im beginning to wonder if bethlehem is really as far from the 
north pole as we make it if he santa were made for children he 
was born in the mind of adults in the spirit the yearning the 
brokenness the hopes of adults 
he is in all of this commercial earthy secular 
materialistic and often corny glory something of a prayer in 
disguise 
he is our yearning and our question the question of christmas 
is there anyone there beyond ourselves and if you are there do 
you really care as christians we profess to have heard gods 
answer 
we claim it we retell it the story that christ is born and 
born again the light of that story can reach into the silent 
darkness of others yearnings and suffering campbell says perhaps 
heard in the words yes santa there is a god

christmas services provide an opportunity to draw 
alienated catholics back into regular worship but priests tend to 
ridicule and demean them for attending so infrequently says the 
rev andrew greeley 
writing in us catholic published by the claretian fathers the 
noted priestsociologistnovelist says 
one of the more twisted and sick kinks in clerical culture is 
the propensity to ridicule and demean the christmas catholics and 
even when priests are on their best behavior to patronize them 
greeley says christmas catholics who show up only on such 
holidays often are alienated from the church having been hurt or 
confused by it and they need to know theres room for them in the 
inn too 
he adds welcoming the alienated and inviting them to come home 
and stay home permanently is surely far more in the spirit of 
christmas than brutalizing them again

your football team punted the playoffs relatives 
are descending for the holidays and network tv is cluttered with 
junk 
tis the season to give thanks that you paid your cable bill for 
hbo has a nice little outofseason movie this month dead solid 
perfect an adaptation of dan jenkins novel of the same name 
about life on the links what better time of year to be delivered 
from gray winter landscapes to the land of greens fairways 
sandtraps and perpetual short sleeves 
dead solid perfect is dead solid funny and a nice little love 
story to boot it premiered last week but you can still catch it 
tonight friday and next tuesday 
kenny lee randy quaid is a diamondintherough golfer 
hustling bets on the side so he can afford to get to the next 
tournament 
enter hubert bad hair wimberly jack warden a hustler with 
more money than he knows what to do with but a nasty slice hell 
never be able to buy off so he buys kenny becoming his sponsor on 
the tour 
exit beverly kathryn harrold kennys intelligent wife tired 
of hanging out with jerks like bad hair and dragging herself around 
the country to watch kenny cuss and sling golf clubs in disgust 
forget caddyshack this is the definitive golf movie of the 
80s director bobby roth who cowrote the screenplay with jenkins 
does for the links what martin scorsese did for pool in the color 
of money roth and jenkins successfully teamed on baja 
oklahoma for hbo earlier this year 
the music is by tangerine dream and the theme song is sung by 
billy vera 
larry riley costars as spec kennys caddy a talented golfer 
himself who stays in the background rather than challenge the racism 
of the sponsorship game at one point as kenny is preparing for a 
big tournament spec warns bad hair give him one word of advice 
and ill burn down your mansion and marry your daughter 
brett cullen plays kennys friend donny smithern a successful 
young pro who gets recognized in restaurants cheats on his good ol 
gal wife delane matthews and waxes phony pious in tv interviews 
jenkins is one of a handful of male authors around who can write 
realistic women he gives his female characters a sense of humor 
without making them just sound like men good ol donny beverly 
sneers at one point hell always be there when he needs you 
after beverly leaves kenny he takes up with janie corinne 
bohrer a bimbo savant who chucks her job as a bartender to 
accompany him on the tour at first he plays well and its party 
time but kenny warns janie during an rrated romp in their hotel

kenny starts playing really badly after he gets shook up by 
running into beverly and a new beau at a restaurant janie gamely 
tries to trade insults with beverly and spews a blue streak 
observes beverly why you didnt tell me she talked like princess 
di 
eventually the film veers off into a standardissue plotline 
about a tumor and kennys big showdown with donny on the 18th hole 
of the us open but if the story is predictable its also 
satisfying because jenkins characters are immensely likable and 
roths direction is like kennys play for those brief shining 
moments just dead solid perfect

deep in the basement of the new england aquarium a 
seal named goofy lounges in his private tank taking a casual glance 
at observers before rolling bellyup inches below the waters 
surface 
outside in nippy 30degree temperatures 3yearold rigel darts 
about his pool twirling splashy pirouettes and barking hi in 
return for a steady supply of fish 
rigel and goofy enjoy safe harbor at the aquarium just two of 
the sick orphaned or stranded animals taken in under a marine 
mammal rescue program that began 15 years ago 
in terms of a job its a real satisfying sort of thing said 
greg early the programs supervisor 
goofy was picked up on a danvers beach this fall rigel was an 
orphan found in maine about two years ago he was released once but 
didnt take to the wild 
he was a young orphan pup raised on seal formula and weaned on 
to fish he was released up in maine and about a day or two later 
he showed up on a beach early said 
volunteers recall how rigel identified by tags crawled onto a 
beach blanket in the middle of a crowd and when placed on the front 
floorboards of a truck climbed up onto the seat and went to sleep 
we brought him back in and said it seems like rigel wants to 
stay here early said 
this year the aquarium has picked up more than 150 animals 
early said many sick or injured and most of them already dead 
seals are the most common animals rescued but from october to 
january the focus is on whales which often strand themselves on 
cape cod beaches 
the aquarium now has four residents of the program a sea turtle 
chewed up by a shark and three seals about 50 percent of the seals 
found survive and are returned to the wild or sent to zoos early 
said 
harbor seals which grow to about 5 feet and can weigh 220 
pounds usually keep to secluded beaches rocky reefs and mud flats 
since they spend part of their time on land they dont really get 
stranded but when theyre ill they often stay out of the water for 
unusually long periods 
goofy who appears satisfied to stay in his pool and be fed more 
than 15 pounds of food a day is a likely zoo candidate because he 
seems to lack the fortitude to survive in the wild early said 
when he was picked up he was very very docile which for a 
harbor seal is not normal early said 
rigel named after the brightest star in the constellation of 
orion is working on an appropriately stellar career at the 
aquariums seal pool many male seals vocalize particularly around 
mating season but rigel can bark a creditable hi on command and 
splashes around the pool to show off to passersby 
were working on teaching rigel hello said jenny montague 
supervisor of seal training he is actually kind of a ham

the hard part of falling down is getting up 
violet holmes should know shes the woman who supervises the 
dominolike descent of 36 rockettes in the parade of the wooden 
soldiers one of the most popular production numbers at radio city 
music halls annual christmas show 
its very difficult says holmes a former rockette who now 
directs the highkicking dance line at new yorks famous art deco 
entertainment palace you cant just bend and get yourself up in 
stiff starched pants the girls turn around and help each other 
up 
the fiveminute dance is a precision military march done by the 
rockettes dressed as toy wooden soldiers it ends with a cannon shot 
a puff of smoke that knocks over the line of dancers they fall 
one by one on top of each other and the audience cheers 
the fall has to be done just right holmes says you have 
to hold the girl in front of you bringing her to you as she falls 
back you have to fall back to the girl behind you you have to make 
sure your legs are straight and that your arms are open so that the 
girl behind you catches you if they dont the whole thing will 
slide right down 
the march was choreographed originally by russell markert who 
founded the rockettes in 1932 when radio city opened 
markert had formed other highkicking precision kick lines he 
started with the st louis rockets in 1925 moved them to new york 
for a part in the 1928 musical hit rain or shine and then to 
the roxy theater where they were know as the roxyettes it was at 
the roxy that markert first choreographed the parade of the wooden 
soldiers 
radio city beckoned four years later and the line with the name 
rockettes has been there ever since so have those wooden soldiers 
with holmes supervising the march every year its one of the 
highlights of the christmas show which will be on view through jan 
4 
how do you teach someone to fall 
slooowly says holmes she usually begins by teaching it in 
sections of 10 or 12 dancers lined up in a row the others watch 
and they all get pointers from dancers who have done the number 
before 
a march of any kind is very difficult to teach holmes says 
the lines have to be perfect because its so obvious if one girl 
sticks out its the guiding and keeping straight lines and walking 
with straight knees not bent knees in stiff starched pants 
sometimes the line has dancers who think that if they hold the 
fall a little bit its going to help the weight holmes adds it 
doesnt 
if the fall starts and the line is crooked theres nothing a 
dancer can do to correct it its like youre in midair holmes 
says 
there have been injuries over the years although none serious 
the director says if properly done the number is not 
dangerous she adds 
the first girl who falls has the easiest job its the last 
dancer who has it tough even though she collapses on a big fat 
pillow 
shes waiting and looking at these 36 girls coming at her 
holmes says thats frightening and you dont know how fast the 
fall is going to come it can come very easily or like a whip 
the fall is supposed to go easily smoothly and slowly 
you are not supposed to look out and down because that would 
throw the line crooked they should only look at the girls head 
right in front of them she says so you anticipate but you 
dont know what youre anticipating because you cant see anything 
the parade has been modified slightly over the years at some 
christmas shows the soldiers came down a ramp from a castle or out 
of sentry boxes today the rockettes just march out from the wings 
of the large stage still what audiences see at radio city is much 
of the original version according to holmes although she has cut 
it by two minutes to fit more smoothly into the halls current 
90minute christmas extravaganza 
the director has her own charts and notes to guide her through 
the restaging but she doesnt need them 
after all these years you know it by heart she says you 
dont have to consult your notes anymore besides ive tried to 
keep it the same why change anything that is so successful

the peronist party implanted in 
argentina as the voice of the workers and the poor by juan d peron 
and his wife eva four decades ago is in a resurgence it hopes will 
bring victory in presidential elections set for may 
it has been out of power for 12 years 
virtually every poll gives peronist carlos saul menem a colorful 
provincial governor a commanding lead over the candidate of the 
governing radical civic union eduardo angeloz 
provincial and congressional elections last year reversed 
peronist setbacks in 1983 when civilian government was restored 
after nearly eight years of military dictatorship during which 
peronist politicians including menem were jailed peronist 
teachers were dismissed from universities and labor leaders were 
arrested and executed 
in september 1987 peronist candidates swept 17 of the countrys 
22 provinces including buenos aires the biggest the partys 
inroads in the house of deputies eliminated the radicals majority 
in 1983 it wasnt alfonsin against luder it was the radicals 
against the peronists losing candidate italo argentino luder said 
in an interview referring to raul alfonsin alfonsin swamped luder 
52 percent to 40 in the balloting for president in postmilitary 
argentina 
now it is totally different the 71yearold luder said 
the economy is the biggest theme inflation foreign debt 
growth employment purchasing power and the radicals have 
totally failed in government 
pollster manuel mora y araujos surveys consistently give menem 
twice as big a share of the vote as angeloz though he notes that 
undecideds have crept up to 35 percent 
you cant say menems victory is beyond doubt but hes 
definitely ahead the pollster said 
peron founded the party following his victory in the elections of 
1946 the most honest and widely attended in two decades 
an army colonel at the time peron later was promoted by congress 
to general with his wildly popular and politically astute wife eva 
at his side and sometimes acting on her own peron won the support 
of workers disenfranchised by previous conservative governments 
peron industrialized an agricultural economy based on grain and 
beef nationalized industries promoted such legislation as 
collective bargaining and pensions vastly extended public education 
and health services and gave women the right to vote 
peron established a dictatorship that remained popular so long as 
eva evita as she was affectionately known was around popular 
support began to diminish after her death of cancer in 1952 and with 
the economy in trouble in 1955 the military overthrew peron and sent 
him into exile in spain 
he made a triumphal return in 1971 and was elected president 
again in 1973 with his new wife isabel as his vice president she 
took the presidency upon perons death in 1974 only to be ousted by 
the military two years later 
while the perons themselves have had their ups and downs the 
party has generally maintained its base of organized labor and the 
poor 
the 4millionmember general workers confederation the chief 
labor union was born is and will always be peronist the 
53yearold menem told a recent rally 
but party leaders now are trying to appeal to the middle class 
which they see as key to the 50 percent of the vote required by 
argentine law to win the election outright and avoid a runoff in the 
electoral college 
luder an attorney who is one of menems advisers says appealing 
to the middle class is a natural move 
peronism created this country as we know it today he said 
the sons and grandsons of the workers of 1946 today are 
businessmen teachers professionals 
argentines in those stations however tend to support the 
radical civic union or the conservative union of the democratic 
center of alvaro alsogaray a former economy minister and former 
us ambassador 
todays peronists are finding their overtures frustrated by the 
partys image of violence demagoguery and administrative 
incompetence a public perception menem calls his partys black 
legend 
even tripledigit inflation rising unemployment stagnant growth 
and three military insurrections under president alfonsin cannot 
shake the recollections of betteroff argentines that some of the 
countrys economic and political low points occurred under peronist 
governments 
peron squandered huge gold reserves built up during world war ii 
crowded out private business by expanding the states role in the 
economy made public employment conditional on party membership 
tolerated corruption and thuggery against his opponents closed down 
newspapers antagonized the roman catholic church 
in the final months before isabel peron was ousted by the 
military in 1976 argentina was torn by murderous street violence 
outofcontrol inflation and paralyzing strikes 
peronist governments have never understood economics said 
juan balassoni a medical products importer its very possible he 
menem would return control to the unions so the unions would 
govern not the government 
a welldressed middleaged woman at a rally for alsogaray in a 
downtown sports stadium said if menem wins the country will 
slide backwards despite his best intentions i favor shrinking 
the size of the state selling state companies the peronists would 
never sell state companies 
national elections set for may 14 may hang in the balance of 
opinions like theirs votes in the electoral college are tied to the 
popular ballot if menem fails to win at least 50 percent alsogaray 
could determine the election by throwing his support to angeloz 
menem at times seems to hurt his own cause by endorsing ideas 
that appear contradictory and are never fully explained 
although argentina is a country notorious for tax evasion menem 
has said he would curtail the fiscal deficit not by cutting back 
state employment or selling off moneylosing state enterprises but 
by cutting tax rates in the hope that would spur compliance and 
generate additional revenue 
under his program workers would receive big wage increases but 
he has not fully explained where the money would come from 
menems allies dont always help 
while he tries to project an image of moderation and 
statesmanship mrs peron in november dredged up unhappy memories by 
endorsing an amnesty for the former military chiefs who directed the 
socalled dirty war against subversives and the leftist 
montonero urban guerrillas in the 1970s 
at least 8900 argentines were arrested and disappeared 
during that campaign forced to take a position on that sensitive 
issue menem said he opposed an amnesty 
in another case the leader of a leftist peronist splinter group 
pablo unamuno publicly stated that menem would pardon mario 
firmenich the montonero leader who is in prison for murder 
extortion and kidnapping an angry menem denied he planned any such 
pardon and suspended unamuno from the party 
the radicals have seized upon such rifts and gaffes to fan 
passions and fears that are never far from the surface in this 
politically polarized country 
violence is part of their history said angelozs press 
secretary oscar fernandez soares the peronist party still has 
violent elements in its structure

president carlos salinas de gortari has kicked 
a political hornets nest by suggesting the roman catholic church 
technically illegal in mexico since 1917 be restored to normal 
status 
the constitution ratified in that year by the triumphant forces 
of the mexican revolution went beyond separation of church and 
state it denied the church legal existence and tried to eliminate 
church influence 
mexico remains the most catholic country in the hemisphere 
nonetheless and the church has not faded every year millions of 
people take part in public processions to the basilica of the virgin 
of guadalupe the countrys patron saint 
salinas acknowledged reality by declaring in his inaugural speech 
dec 1 that a modern state deals openly and modernizes its 
relationship with unions business groups news organizations 
and the church 
it was the first time in modern mexico a president publicly 
acknowledged the church as part of society sitting in the gallery 
for the first time were representatives of the church cardinal 
ernesto corripio ahumada four other bishops and papal nuncio 
girolamo prigione the popes ambassador 
church leaders welcomed the move and conservative parties said 
they favored a debate to redefine the churchs role critics said 
the government should stick to the constitution 
salinas institutional revolutionary party which has controlled 
the government since it was founded 60 years ago was torn between 
supporting him and loyalty to the constitutions framers 
congresswoman socorro diaz said the reopening of a debate 
settled by history does not strengthen national unity and 
creates disagreement and confrontation among mexicans she is 
director of el dia a newspaper sponsored by the partys left wing 
some saw the presidents move as an effort to widen support for 
his government while his party is losing traditional backing from 
labor and the middle class 
the issue does divide the opposition during a debate in 
congress conservatives shouted fanatic robespierre and 
son of lenin at leftwing members who opposed the reassessment 
an officially anticlerical government leading a largely catholic 
population is one of mexicos contradictions the government ignores 
technical violations of the law by the church in order to maintain 
social peace 
one paragraph in article 130 of the constitution says the law 
does not recognize the religious associations known as churches 
in the eyes of the peasant union and military revolutionaries 
who wrote it the church was part of an oppressive landowning 
establishment to the hierarchy they were godless destroyers of 
established order 
churches cannot own property and the government has the power to 
determine the number of priests in each state foreign priests are 
prohibited from working in mexico and public displays of religion 
are forbidden 
priests do not have the right to vote but do so they are not 
allowed to speak or write about politics or the government but 
write opinion columns they are barred from teaching but the 
catholic church runs schools and universities where the children of 
government leaders study 
presidents hold private meetings with bishops 
two million people attended a mass in mexico city conducted by 
pope john paul ii he spent a week in mexico during his first trip 
to america 
in the late 1920s catholics conducted the cristero revolt 
because of government persecution a church hero was the rev miguel 
pro a jesuit priest executed by the government who was beatified 
in november 
a few days after the salinas inaugural interior minister 
fernando gutierrez barrios caused frontpage headlines by declaring 
the church exists and since then the debate has covered acres 
of newsprint 
in congress popular socialist party member alfredo reyes 
contreras said even the presence of prelates at the inauguration had 
violated the mexican constitution he demanded an investigation 
a leader of the unified socialist party gilberto rincon 
gallardo a catholic said change is needed because the current 
situation stimulates fanaticism 
the popular and unified socialist parties both belong to the 
democratic front coalition that supported cuauhtemoc cardenas 
against salinas in the july 6 presidential election 
salinas should be able to get the twothirds vote he needs in 
congress to change the constitution if he wants to do so his party 
controls 60 of 64 senate seats and although it has only 260 of 500 
lower house seats it can expect support from the conservative 
national action partys 101 members

patients at inge kemp genefkes clinic 
for torture victims say their injuries often were inflicted in the 
presence of doctors nurses or psychologists people trained to 
heal 
the danish physician said it has become clear during six years of 
treating battered refugees and studying torture cases that medical 
personnel nearly always were involved even if only giving tacit 
assent 
in a welldocumented case in uruguay a prison psychologist 
advised torturers on how to break victims 
studies by the clinic indicate up to 25000 people in the medical 
profession are involved 
torture could not take place to the extent it does today if 
doctors were not implicated the doctor said these doctors 
should be thrown out of medical organizations and not only in their 
own country 
dr genefke is director of the international rehabilitation and 
research center for torture victims it treats victims publishes 
educational material trains doctors and psychologists in the care 
of victims and conducts courses for police and others who deal with 
refugees 
it is private and independent financed by the government and 
private donations 
her study of torture started 15 years ago when dr genefke was 
in a group of physicians asked by the amnesty international human 
rights group to examine victims for evidence of torture 
she opened the center in 1982 in a wing of university hospital in 
copenhagen and has helped establish similar facilities in the united 
states the philippines norway and elsewhere the copenhagen clinic 
has a staff of 30 doctors psychologists and others who treat 70100 
victims and families every year 
the 1988 right livelihood award was given to dr genefke baron 
jakob von uexkull established the prize in 1980 for humanitarian 
work 
estimates by the center indicate 30 percent of the approximately 
24000 people given asylum in denmark have been exposed to torture 
we used to believe that medical personnel participating in 
torture was a rare phenomenon but now we know that almost all 
torture victims have been in contact with them in the actual torture 
process said peter vesti a staff psychiatrist 
today we know the purpose of torture is not to get information 
but to destroy the personality and spread terror to control the 
population 
in 1986 the center broadened its scope to include research and 
documentation on torture in cooperation with doctors in latin 
america and europe 
an international committee has been formed to expose illegal 
practices and revoke licenses of doctors involved with torture 
amnesty international has estimated torture is practiced in at least 
90 countries 
in uruguay and in chile the medical associations have been 
extremely brave and courageous dr genefke said 
several hundred military doctors are believed involved in torture 
in each of those countries the center has reported dr francisco 
rivas former director of chiles medical association told the 
associated press in santiago four doctors had been expelled and two 
suspended from membership 
they are a really astounding example of how national medical 
associations can deal with this issue eric stover of the american 
association for the advancement of science said in a telephone 
interview 
not only have they disciplined physicians while the pinochet 
government is in power they have adopted a set of guidelines for 
physicians 
stover said chiles was a unique case of a medical association 
acting against doctors involved in torture while a military 
government remained in power 
in uruguay where democracy was restored in 1985 the ethics 
board of the physicians union imposed sanctions on four doctors 
including eduardo saiz found to have issued a death certificate in 
1984 that concealed evidence of torture 
all four continue practicing medicine in uruguay however about 
200 doctors have given depositions about their activities under the 
military dictatorship that began in 1973 but action has been taken 
only against saiz and the other three 
in brazil last march the regional council of medicine revoked 
the license of amilcar lobo an army doctor who attended torture 
sessions in 19701974 brazilian press reports say lobo has 
implicated other doctors but no formal charges have resulted 
emilie trautmann of amnesty international said the turkish 
medical association was investigating charges in that country 
dr genefke said the involvement of medical people in torture can 
take many forms for example a doctor can examine a prisoner and 
conclude that he or she has a weak heart and should not have 
electrical torture because they are not supposed to die 
she also said psychological torture often involving threats can 
be worse than physical punishment 
her center has done extensive research on torture methods in 
order to develop the most effective medical and psychological care 
for victims most are treated as outpatients 
treatment at the center combines physiotherapy psychotheraphy 
and social counseling it usually lasts 10 to 12 months 
the clinic decor is cheerful and the atmosphere friendly beige 
and yellow furniture and flowered textiles are used to reduce the 
resemblance to a medical institution 
patients report such tortures as hanging by hands or elbows 
sometimes for days electric shocks beatings amd holding the head 
under filthy water 
long afterward patients often have such symptoms as sexual 
disturbance hallucinations fear confusion nightmares and loss of 
selfconfidence and selfrespect vesti said 
as dr genefke explained it there is so much fear anger 
aggressions shame and guilt that has to be expressed and it is 
very very difficult we dont call our patients torture victims we 
call them torture survivors

almost from the minute he takes the presidential oath jan 20 
george bush will face a raft of fastdeveloping foreign policy 
issues in a world that has changed radically from the one ronald 
reagan found eight years before 
most immediately pressing perhaps is the middle east where the 
united states could be on the verge of its first major involvement 
in a peace effort since henry a kissingers shuttle diplomacy of 
the 1970s 
mikhail s gorbachevs changing soviet union and more ussoviet 
arms agreements also are likely items on the agenda for the early 
days of the bush presidency 
then there is china and its new contacts with moscow europe 
where the east is at a crossroads and the west looks with less 
trepidation toward the soviet bloc latin america with its debt and 
economic stagnation africa where south african apartheid remains a 
troublesome and delicate issue for the white house and asia where 
burgeoning economies still pour goods into main street usa 
even the south pacific the place people dream of for tranquil 
escape has become a piece in the world chess game 
each year at this time the associated press asks its 
correspondents in strategic areas of the world to look ahead to what 
americans can expect abroad in the new year 
for 1989 they were asked to look ahead to what president bush 
can expect in his first year in office 
these are their reports

george bush inherits a rapidly changing 
climate in the middle east where a us dialogue with the plo holds 
the seeds of a possible breakthrough in settling the arabisraeli 
conflict 
the reagan administrations decision dec 14 to talk to the 
palestine liberation organization after its chairman yasser arafat 
said the plo recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism will give bush the opportunity to make a significant 
impact on the longstalled peace process 
whatever the outcome of the usplo dialogue it will put 
pressure on israel appalled at the us decision to negotiate with 
the plo on the creation of a palestinian state declared in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip by the plos parliamentinexile 
with israel increasingly isolated bush could be in a position to 
encourage prime minister yitzhak shamir to be more flexible but 
there will likely be hard bargaining amid arab soviet and european 
pressure for an international peace conference attended by the plo 
bush will also find new possibilities for resuming relations with 
iran under the islamic republics developing opendoor policy of 
improving its ties with the rest of the world ending nine years of 
political isolation 
that could improve the prospects of freeing western hostages in 
lebanon most of the 16 foreigners including nine americans are 
held by proiranian shiite moslem extremists

in less than four years mikhail s gorbachev has 
painted over the image of the soviet union as a boastful 
missilewielding totalitarian state with a portrait of a hopeful 
giant struggling to pull itself up by the bootstraps and join the 
community of peaceful nations 
but the soviet union still has those missiles and if president 
bush is to continue a period of easing world tensions he must find 
some way to break the deadlock that prevented his predecessor from 
signing an agreement with gorbachev to slash strategic arsenals in 
half 
the initial roadblock remains president reagans star wars 
program to develop a spacebased defense against missile attack 
gorbachev insists such a program only opens a new dangerous arena 
for the arms race and makes reductions in offensive weapons 
impossible beyond that lie unresolved questions about how the two 
sides can fairly balance reductions in their inherently different 
land sea and air weapons systems 
gorbachev is busy not only trying to restructure the economy and 
way of thinking in his own country but he also is trying to break 
down eastwest barriers and develop new trade relationships 
throughout the world the united states has moved more slowly than 
some nations in asia and western europe to encourage an end to 
soviet isolation and support development of a potentially powerful 
new soviet market 
some westerners have suggested the kremlins efforts to improve 
relations particularly with west germany could weaken us ties to 
its nato partners as gorbachev works to build what he calls a 
common european home

in eastern europe george bush 
faces a delicate balancing act between communist authorities opening 
up to reform and the increasingly vocal and active independent 
groups who want the west to insist on more human rights 
as in the soviet union communist governments in hungary poland 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria are realizing they must open up to 
economic and perhaps political reform in order to modernize outmoded 
industry and keep consumer demands satisfied 
east germany and romania for the time being have rejected any 
need for the change their allies have embraced with varying degrees 
of enthusiasm 
but new laws allowing more private and foreign investment in east 
bloc economies will not boost output unless the west agrees to make 
large loans and import or sell its advanced technology 
some west european leaders have talked of a kind of marshall 
plan to help out eastern europe where massive investment would be 
needed to provide modern housing and industry and clean up the 
heavily polluted environment 
but independent groups encouraged by president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms in the soviet union are also placing increasing 
demands for genuine democracy 
us trade with eastern europe traditionally has been small but 
bush will have a voice in determining the stand of allies like west 
germany with significant business activities in the east as they 
try to juggle the demands of communists for more money and activists 
for a firm stand on human rights

a fresh push will likely be made to wrap up negotiations with the 
soviet union on reducing longrange nuclear weapons in december 
1987 president reagan and gorbachev signed the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty which provides for eliminating all us and 
soviet landbased missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3400 miles 
the bush administration also will closely monitor the moves of 
the 12nation european economic community or common market to form 
a single market by the end of 1992 thats when the nations are to 
remove many of the trade barriers separating them

china and the soviet union are expected to hold 
their first summit in 30 years by mid1989 ending a rift that 
drastically reshaped the strategic thinking of the world powers 
the reagan administration stressed it welcomed the easing of 
tensions between the two giants and expressed faith in chinese 
assertions they will never return to the relationship of the 1950s 
when beijing was a subservient ally of moscow 
but george bush a former us ambassador to china will need to 
take a new look at how china figures in american strategic interests 
when mikhail s gorbachevs meeting with deng xiaoping formally 
makes americas china card obsolete 
uschinese relations based on shared antipathy to soviet 
policies have long been overshadowed by more substantially binding 
ties total trade for 1988 is expected to reach 12 billion and 
continues to grow us businesses have invested 3 billion in 
chinas modernization drive scientific military and cultural 
exchanges are everyday occurrences and thousands of chinese study 
at american universities and research centers 
the bush administration must decide how far to push china to play 
a larger role in ending the war in cambodia china provides arms and 
political support to the khmer rouge the strongest faction in the 
antivietnamese coalition in cambodia vietnam insists the 
withdrawal of its troops hinges on assurances the khmer rouge 
blamed for the deaths of 1 million cambodians when they ruled in the 
1970s not return to power 
the end of the iraniraq war in the middle east eased 
uschinese tensions over chinese arms sales to iran however

south americas crushing foreign debt and

debtor countries including brazil argentina and peru spent 1988 
struggling with stagnant economies soaring inflation and spreading 
social turmoil 
shackled by huge debt obligations their governments are looking 
north for reduced interest rates and other forms of financial 
relief it would be proof they contend that the united states and 
other wealthy countries are sincere in their pledge to back the 
continents young and increasingly troubled democracies 
few south americans expect any radical change in us policy when 
george bush takes office however his secretary of state former 
treasury chief james baker proposed three years ago a program of 
new credits that debtor countries said did not go far enough 
the billiondollar cocaine business also is seen as endangering 
the stability of some south american countries including colombia 
peru ecuador and bolivia despite the arrest of some kingpins and 
seizures of tons of drugs traffickers have remained largely immune 
to law enforcement efforts by bribing intimidating and even killing

with economies booming from south korea to 
singapore the far east will present george bush with trade 
frictions as well as uncertainties over domestic instability in key 
allied countries and strains over us military bases 
japans juggernaut economy has accommodated to us pressure to 
increase domestic demand for imported goods but as 1988 ended 
exports also were on an upswing threatening more trouble for the 
enduring us trade deficit 
the little dragons south korea hong kong taiwan and 
singapore had economic growth rates of 6 to 115 percent in 1988 
with much of their production aimed at the lucrative us market 
political strife in newly democratized countries like the 
philippines and south korea will cause uneasiness and both 
countries have growing domestic opposition to strategically 
important us bases 
another problem with the philippines for bush is how to 
coordinate with japan and western europe on an aid package to help 
reduce the countrys 28billion debt and not break the us 
treasury 
in indochina washington will have to figure out how the emerging 
chinesesoviet rapprochement will affect the drive to get 
sovietallied vietnam to withdraw from cambodia without permitting 
the chinabacked khmer rouge guerrillas to return to rule 
washington supports the mercurial prince norodom sihanouk as

intervention in afghanistan by feb 15 recently bypassed president

with washington but seeks to improve ties with moscow heavy 
military aid to pakistan still will be needed to counter soviet

india the subcontinents biggest military and political force 
has improved ties with washington while remaining friendly with

south africas white leaders 
were relieved by george bushs election and they are apt to use 
tactics in 1989 that would help him stifle any new sanctions 
campaign by democrats in congress 
these could include additional releases of political prisoners 
softening of some remaining apartheid laws and further diplomatic 
overtures toward black africa the new year could see final 
agreement on independence for southwest africa also known as 
namibia another development that would improve south africas 
standing in washington and elsewhere 
in response to such gestures antiapartheid leaders in south 
africa and their allies abroad are likely to tell bush that 
continued pressure on the government is essential to force it to 
lift harsh stateofemergency regulations and grant full political 
rights to the black majority 
the probable settlement in namibia is to be coupled to withdrawal 
of cuban troops from neighboring angola where they have been aiding 
the marxist government in a civil war against the unita rebel 
movement bush will have to decide if and when to halt us aid to 
the rebels 
elsewhere in africa the new administration will have to wrestle 
with a budgetary dilemma can it meet its deficitcutting 
priorities at home and still make an acceptable aid contribution to 
a continent with staggering development needs 
the soviet bloc seems to have abandoned expansionist policies on 
the continent and leftleaning governments in countries such as 
mozambique angola and ethiopia seem more willing than ever to turn

us concerns about soviet intentions in 
the south pacific will be a major issue facing george bushs 
presidency 
in a landmark speech in vladivostok in july 1985 mikhail s

the pacific 
a soviet military threat seems remote but as one us admiral 
said they have the capability soviet intentions added a 
senior diplomat are the issue 
moscow after winning a string of fishing agreements with small 
island nations and then losing them is now courting australia 
the collapse of anzus the australianew zealandus military 
treaty is no longer an issue but what is is the whole range of 
alliances in a part of the world where a nuclearcapable us navy 
is not as welcome as it once was 
other issues likely to cross bushs desk are those of immediate

canada will be looking for reassurance from 
president bush that it is trusted as an ally and valued as the 
united states no 1 trading partner 
a bruising campaign that gave prime minister brian mulroney his 
second consecutive majority government put the spotlight on canadian 
concerns that the country is taken for granted ignored or 
overshadowed in the united states 
the victory for mulroneys progressive conservative party cleared 
the way for the free trade agreement with the united states to 
proceed but it is a longterm pact that will be phased in over 10 
years 
canadians will be looking for some signs that their willingness 
to cooperate with washington can produce some tangible results in an 
easing of the trade squabbles still likely to occur in aspects 
uncovered by the agreement 
and with economic growth expected to slow down in both 
countries great attention will be paid here to any plant closings 
attributed to the new trade pact 
in other issues canada will be looking to bush to take promised 
steps to cut down sulphur dioxide emissions blamed in large part for 
producing the acid rain that devastates canadian aquatic life in 
sensitive lakes and streams 
the private canadian coalition on acid rain found bushs stand on 
acid rain an improvement over the reagan administrations record but 
weaker and vaguer than michael dukakis

mexico and the united states face as many 
problems as ever but under the presidencies of george bush in 
washington and carlos salinas de gortari in mexico city their 
historically prickly relationship will probably improve 
prime among problems in the coming months will be mexicos 
foreign debt now 102 billion salinas says the 13 billion annual 
payments should be reduced because they arent leaving enough money 
for economic growth 
salinas inaugurated dec 1 is expected to tell bankers in 1989 
that stifling growth is counterproductive in the long run 
renewing growth is vital for salinas because the average 
mexicans standard of living has suffered badly during years of 
austerity salinas won a disputed election and better conditions 
would strengthen his mandate 
bush has given salinas a sympathetic ear and the two appeared to 
hit it off when they met in november a recent 35 billion us 
loan offer was seen as a vote of confidence salinas is a hardnosed 
negotiator but he is unlikely to let pride get in the way of 
practical solutions 
other issues 
trade mexico fears protectionist sentiment will cut access to 
us markets restricting growth opportunities a us recession 
would also hurt mexico if exports went down 
migration mexico resents the way migrants looking for jobs in 
the united states are treated since they fill an apparent need 
salinas argues that growth is a key here too because more jobs in 
mexico would reduce migration 
drugs salinas has promised a harder fight against drug 
trafficking but expects the united states to crack down on demand 
central america mexicans are hopeful the new administration 
will focus less on an anticommunist crusade in central america 
which was very unpopular here

cocacola co has been stuck with 20 million 
pairs of 3d glasses ever since the last episode of moonlighting 
was nixed last spring by the writers strike it says it just found 
a super way to use them 
the soft drink giant the national football league and nbc 
announced monday they would cooperate in a threedimensional 
broadcast of the 12minute super bowl xxiii halftime show and a 
45second diet coke ad next month 
the atlantabased company said its bottlers would distribute the 
special glasses which will enable fans to see the 3d approach 
with purchases of diet coke in the two weeks before the jan 22 
contest for the nfl championship 
cocacola ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing 
with the moonlighting producers that a commercial and a portion 
of the final show of the 198788 season would be shot with the new 
3d technology 
but the episode was canceled after the writers went on strike and 
the cocacola commercial never was made production of the glasses 
was halted at 20 million and they were stored while cocacola looked 
for other tv showcases 
network executives said the halftime program would be the first 
live 3d broadcast on network television and would continue nbcs 
tradition of innovation in football coverage nbc broadcast a 
silent minute to give viewers a break from the super bowl 
pregame show in 1986 and aired an entire regular season game with 
no announcers a few years ago 
viewers will need the glasses to get the 3d effect but a new 
technology called nuoptix 3d developed by terry beard founder and 
head of the losangelesbased nuoptix associates inc leaves the 
picture normal for others 
the patented process avoids the distortion or doubleimaging of 
the picture that the 3d processes of the 1950s caused for those 
without special glasses 
not content to let a volley sound in the cola wars without 
responding pepsicola co announced separately monday that its diet 
pepsi brand has agreed to be the official sponsor of nbcs nfl 
player talent show to be broadcast before the big game the talent 
show will match nfl players in competition as singers dancers and 
comedians 
calling the announcement a surprise move pepsis executive 
vice president of marketing and sales michael lorelli said diet 
pepsis endrun on diet coke just signaled the start of an intense 
offthefield battle 
asked about pepsis announcement at the news conference where he 
announced the deal with cocacola nbc sports executive producer 
michael weisman said the network had not settled sponsorship of the 
pregame talent show 
but a pepsi spokesman tod mackenize insisted that pepsicola 
had returned a signed contract to nbc last week and that the deal 
was done 
cocacola based in atlanta and pepsicola based in somers 
ny dominate the 432 billion us soft drink business 
diet coke is the bestselling diet soft drink and the third 
biggest seller overall with about 82 percent of the overall soft 
drink market diet pepsi ranks second in the category and fourth 
overall at 52 percent 
the two soft drink giants are always on the lookout for splashy 
new ways to boost anticipation of their commercials and get big 
audiences for them 
michael beindorff vice president for advertising at cocacola 
said he had been aproached with dozens of opportunities to showcase 
a 3d commercial but rejected them until the super bowl opportunity 
came along 
this is not just a few minutes or a couple of special 
effects beindorff said its not just pregame fluff or a 
postgame throwaway

joseph made his remarks over a publicaddress system and they

the sources paraphrased joseph as saying not at this point 
does a settlement make sense 
the nations fifthlargest securities firm has been the subject 
of an intense investigation for more than two years stemming from 
its involvement with ivan f boesky the onetime speculator now 
serving a 3year prison term for the biggest insider trading fraud 
in us history 
drexel repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing but has been 
negotiating with the manhattan us attorneys office over the past 
two months in an effort to avoid an indictment for racketeering and 
securities fraud 
the government reportedly has demanded that drexel plead guilty 
to multiple felony counts and pay a fine as high as 750 million in 
addition the government has requested drexels assistance in 
implicating other possible wrongdoers both within and outside the 
firm 
steven anreder drexels chief spokesman declined comment on 
josephs reported remarks to employees deborah corley spokeswoman 
for manhattan us attorney rudolph w giuliani also declined 
comment 
there has been heightened speculation in the past few weeks that 
drexel would reach a pleabargain settlement with the government 
before christmas federal prosecutors have intensified the pressure 
by exacting cooperation from at least three traders in drexels west 
coast highyield bond department 
drexels problems began after boesky paid a 100 million fine to 
the securities and exchange commission in november 1986 and agreed 
to plead guilty to a felony charge as part of his pleabargain 
three months ago the sec filed a wideranging civil lawsuit against 
drexel its highyield bond financier michael milken and three other 
key employees accusing them of conspiring with boesky to violate a 
range of securities laws 
drexel was a pioneer in the 175 billion highyield bond market 
it is one of the most profitable wall street firms and has around

a federal judge has thrown out controversial 
firstinthenation state regulations inspired by the 1987 stock 
market crash that allowed stock traders to sue brokers more easily 
in financial disputes 
in a 36page ruling issued monday us district court judge 
douglas p woodlock threw out regulations promulgated in september 
by massachusetts secretary of state michael connolly 
the regulations set to take effect jan prevented stockbrokers 
from requiring customers to agree to arbitration in stock disputes 
instead of lawsuits a top aide to connolly said the state likely 
would appeal the ruling 
a coalition of brokers sued the state in september and woodlock 
heard the case two weeks ago in his ruling he said the us supreme 
court in 1987 upheld the use of predispute arbitration clauses to 
govern resolution of controversies between brokers and their 
customers 
typically the agreements state that in the event of a dispute 
the customer and the broker would go into arbitration before a 
mutually acceptable party the new york stock exchange for example 
rather than take the case to court 
woodlock ruled in favor of the brokers who argued that 
arbitration is a quicker cheaper way of settling disputes and that 
massachusetts had improperly usurped federal authority in regulating 
securities trading 
on the evidence before me it appears that court litigation 
affords customers the opportunity to pay more in legal costs to get 
less in recovery woodlock wrote to the degree that arbitration 
constitutes a more economical form of dispute resolution it may be 
anticipated that regulations which discourage arbitration will have 
the effect of raising commission rates 
the regulations woodlock said single out arbitration 
agreements for more demanding standards than are imposed by the 
general law of contract in massachusetts woodlock said the state 
regulations would increase the federal caseload at a time when the 
court system is already overburdened 
my clients are delighted that the court agreed with our 
position that these regulations were invalid said attorney gerald 
rath of the boston law firm bingham dana amp gould rath represents 
the securities industry association and 10 brokerage firms 
including dean witter reynolds inc fidelity brokerage services 
inc and shearson lehman hutton inc 
deputy secretary of state marty meehan said officials in 
connollys securities division still were reviewing the ruling 
monday evening but he said in all likelihood we will request the 
attorney general to appeal the decision 
meehan said the regulations stemmed from a flood of complaints 
following the stockmarket crash of october 1987 when thousands of 
customers alleged that their urgent stock transactions were 
misplaced or mishandled in the disputes that followed meehan said 
stock customers found to their surprise that they had signed away 
their right to sue 
the state regulations would have required brokers to fully 
disclose the terms of their arbitration agreements and give 
customers the option of maintaining their right to sue in court 
our beef isnt necessarily with the arbitration process 
meehan said our concern is with investors signing away their 
rights unknowingly 
woodlock said full disclosure is desirable but is not adequately 
defined in the state regulations

the economy held back by the summer drought 
expanded at a moderate annual rate of 25 percent last summer the 
slowest pace in nearly two years the government said today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health slowed in the third quarter 
after growing at a robust 34 percent pace in the first quarter and 
30 percent in the second 
that would be good news for analysts worried that the economy is 
overheating and becoming inflationary except that the underlying 
strength is being masked by the temporary effects of the drought 
which seared pastures and shriveled crops that knocked 123 
billion off the gnp which was at an inflation and seasonally 
adjusted annual level of 401 trillion in the julyseptember period 
excluding the drought the gnp grew 39 percent in the second 
quarter and 30 percent in the third 
the gnp figure for the third quarter was a slight downward 
revision from a preliminary estimate of 26 percent issued a month 
ago most economists had been looking for a slight upward 
adjustment it was the slowest pace of expansion since the fourth 
quarter of 1986 
most of the downward revision was accounted for by a 
largerthanpreviouslythought decline in government spending 
the department also increased its estimate of inflation a price 
index tied to gnp and adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in 
buying patterns increased at an annual rate of 53 percent in the 
third quarter up from 50 percent in the second and the fastest 
pace in six years 
in an accompanying report the commerce department said corporate 
profits after taxes advanced 39 percent in the third quarter after 
soaring 89 percent in the second quarter an earlier estimate had 
said third quarter profits rose only a slight 02 percent 
although gnp growth at least for the third quarter has slowed 
to the 20 to 25 percent range that the federal reserve board 
considers sustainable without inflation most analysts believe the 
economy is rebounding in the current quarter but again the drought 
is likely to artificially lower the gnp number 
fed members fear that a gnp growth rate higher than the target 
range will strain factory capacity leading to shortages and 
resulting price increases also by boosting employment the growth 
encourages employers to bid up the prices of attracting qualified 
workers by raising wages the cure is higher interest rates 
designed to make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to 
spend 
the feds tightening since march has had only a marginal impact 
on the economy with growth so strong and jobs so strong it looks 
like the economy has continued to march on said paul w boltz an 
economist with t rowe price associates a financial services firm 
in baltimore 
the fed capped a series of tightening moves in midaugust by 
boosting the discount rate the rate it charges for loans to member 
banks by a half percentage point to 65 percent 
when the numbers came in for august and september it seemed as 
if the dose of tighter money was working the unemployment rate 
after hitting a 14year low of 53 percent in june jumped to 56 
percent in august the feds closely watched measure of factory 
operating rates was holding steady and retail sales posted a rare 
decline in september 
but a series of government reports over the last seven weeks 
shows that the economy came roaring back in october and november 
unemployment dipped down again to the levels of late spring retail 
sales surged and the factory operating rate climbed to the highest 
level in nine years 
the fed responded last week by bumping up the federal funds rate 
the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans by a quarter 
of a percentage point to 8 percent 
michael k evans an economic consultant in washington said it 
is a question of when not if the fed will tighten further 
every economic statistic that has appeared this month has 
been as strong or stronger than the consensus i dont know what the 
fed is waiting for if this had been former fed chairman paul 
volcker the discount would have been raised fed chairman 
alan greenspan is more cautious but there comes a time when it is 
better to get it over with he said 
evans is expecting a discount rate hike early in 1989 boltz 
however says the fed may be satisfied with further increases in the 
federal funds rate and may be saving a discount rate hike the most 
dramatic move it can take for a crisis like a precipitous fall in 
the value of the dollar 
both look for strong gnp growth higher than a 4 percent annual 
rate until higher interest rates take their toll sometime in 
mid1989

inflation slowed last month to an annual rate 
of just 3 percent the government said today as clothing prices 
fell for the first time since august and food prices stabilized for 
the first time since last february 
the labor department said its consumer price index after 
seasonal adjustments rose just 03 percent in november compared 
with a 04 percent gain a month earlier before the seasonal 
adjustments prices rose just 01 percent the department said 
the monthly inflation figure rounded off in the announcement to 
03 was actually 025 adding up to 3 percent annually 
the new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 46 per 
cent for the first 10 months of the year to 44 percent for the 
first 11 months 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commented consumer 
price inflation appears to be moderating he noted that inflation 
has been lower in the second half of the year than the first half 
with only december left another month similar to november could 
enable the reagan administration to finish its last year in office 
meeting its inflation target of 43 percent for 1988 
the commerce department said today that the gross national 
product the broadest measure of economic health expanded at a 
moderate annual rate of 25 percent in the third quarter held back 
by the summer drought for the same period the department reported 
that aftertax corporate profits rose 39 percent down from a 
robust 89 percent increase the previous quarter 
food prices which had risen at an annual rate of 109 percent 
from april through september because of the summer drought were 
unchanged in november after rising only 02 percent in october the 
labor department reported 
clothing prices that had jumped a total of 4 percent in september 
and october with the introduction of new backtoschool and fall 
fashions fell 03 percent last month 
widespread promotional sales for footwear and womens and girls 
clothing were largely responsible for the november decrease the 
labor department said 
housing and shelter costs including residential rents rose 
another 03 percent the same pace they have maintained over the 
past nine months 
natural gas and electric rates were up 18 percent and 01 
percent respectively from october more than offsetting a 2 
percent drop in prices for more heavily purchased home heating oil 
the government said 
the november decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil its 
price is now 108 percent below what it was last spring 
seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from october 
but remain 02 percent less than they were at the end of last year 
and 281 percent below their peak level of march 1981 
excluding food energy and shelter consumer prices for other 
items rose an average 02 percent in november compared with a jump 
of 07 percent the previous month 
the november increase raised the cpi to 1203 from 1202 in 
october meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing 100 in a 
198284 base period would have cost 12030 last month in november 
1987 that same marketbasket would have cost 11540 
new car prices declined by 02 percent reflecting the

for months nearly two dozen 
30000ayear jobs in brownsville with the worlds largest 
windshieldwiper maker have gone begging trico technologies corp 
has failed to find the skilled labor needed for the positions 
the company with twin plants on both sides of the mexican 
border also has to import millions of dollars in supplies from 
other states though it would prefer to do more business in this 
area beset by poverty and unemployment 
companies manufacturing in mexicos maquiladora program would 
like to leave hundreds of millions of dollars in this and other us 
cities along the border if only they had some place to spend it 
researchers say a fortune is bypassing these communities while 
they struggle to catch up with and understand the industrial 
revolution taking place in their backyards 
since the mid1960s mexicos maquiladora program allowing 
foreign operation of manufacturing facilities has brought 1200 
mostly usoperated plants to its northern frontier 
the companies use inexpensive mexican labor and then export the 
components back to the united states paying tax only on the value 
added by the labor of the maquiladora workers who numbered 330000 
in 1987 
us companies including automobile and electronics 
manufacturers have moved operations to the border from the 
industrialized midwest and northeast but most of the parts and 
supplies come from outside of the border area 
a study of the 104 maquiladora plants on mexicos side of the 
border between brownsville and laredo found they annually spend 13 
billion to 16 billion for parts and supplies more than 90 percent 
is spent outside texas said dr j michael patrick director of pan 
american universitys center for entrepreneurship and economic 
development which conducted the study 
the center however learned from companies operating on the 
border that those firms would like to buy 25 percent to 30 percent 
of their component parts and materials locally that would bring 
hundreds of millions of dollars to the region if only those 
materials were available on the border 
the advantages of having a supplier here along the border are 
significant in terms of cost reductions in terms of just 
communicating and being able to get quick turn around on style 
changes on modifications and specifications and so forth patrick 
said now it makes a lot of sense to have your supplier as nearby 
as possible 
but the metal and moldedplastic parts they need just are not 
available in most border areas so they buy from more established 
locales most of the final product assembly also takes place 
elsewhere 
trico is one of the few companies operating a true twin 
plant the ideal maquiladora with a significant work force on both 
sides of the usmexican boundary the 450 employees in brownsville 
finish the windshield wiper products begun by the 1400 workers in 
its matamoros plant 
the buffalo nybased company produces more than 70 percent of 
the original automobile windshield wiper equipment worldwide as 
well as a majority of wiper blades found in auto supply stores 
eighty percent of tricos production has moved to 
brownsvillematamoros in the past two years but it still buys most 
supplies and parts in highly industrialized areas up north 
the game plan is to get those manufacturing operations set up 
down here to eliminate the need to transport parts down here said 
kenneth wertz manager of tricos brownsville operation 
but the area has no history of the type of technically complex 
manufacturing processes needed to produce those parts and no 
experienced work force 
there are certain skills like tool makers that we cant get 
down here wertz said 
a nationwide shortage of toolanddie workers to produce 
precision machine parts is even worse in an area where there has 
been little need for that type of skill he said so the company 
with 22 openings for the highpaying toolanddie positions has 
started inhouse training but it takes several years to turn out an 
experienced tool maker 
meanwhile trico contracts the work out usually to toolanddie 
operations far away 
we dont have any choice wertz said 
none of the locals really relate to that type of 
manufacturing said jerry simpton vice president of del rio 
national bank and head of the industrial development committee for 
the citys chamber of commerce 
the locals may think about putting up a building to lease to 
the industries but not putting up a building to actually do the 
manufacturing simpton said 
bernardo sauceda who has one of the few toolanddie operations 
in the lower rio grande valley said his saucedas precision 
grinding inc in san benito constantly stays busy on one recent 
afternoon his shop was producing quality control gauges for the 
199091 models of an automobile manufacturer he chose not to 
identify with skills he brought back from his years in chicago 
they are skills he realizes his native region lacks 
this is not an industrial area sauceda said its 
agricultural the areas just starting to be industrial 
john heath who operates tentex tool and supply co in laredo 
said he could double his business if he had the skilled toolanddie 
workers 
companies supplying the maquiladoras also hesitate to relocate to 
the border without the security of having several customers in the 
area patrick said that presents opportunities for new local 
companies he said but skilledlabor shortages and banks 
inexperienced in financing industrial plants hinder new growth 
there are some local supply operations gradually developing bob 
despain has seen the growth since three years ago when he founded 
unit source inc producing molded plastic parts in the valley city 
of la feria 
there werent any suppliers in the area and now there are 
30 said despain who has formed a maquiladora consulting firm 
intelecsis inc since leaving unit source after a takeover 
cities however should not overlook the importance of 
warehousing and transportation jobs the maquiladoras create on the 
american side of the border said gary jacobs president of laredo 
national bank 
i would personally rather have the largest maquila and 
manufacturing operations in mexico using laredo texas as their 
warehousing and distribution centers their packaging centers and 
their sales centers than i would to have the same division give us 
a laborintensive minimumwage kind of factory that theyre better 
able to do somewhere else jacobs said

when louise hackett was a teen bride 
whose young marine husband was off fighting the korean war she 
thought it a stroke of luck that she landed a job fresh out of high 
school as a legal secretary 
she had no way of knowing the onthejob training in her northern 
california hometown of yreka would support her and her young son 
after she divorced five years later moreover it would give birth 
to a multimilliondollar business thats about to go nationwide 
after more than 30 years of providing office help to attorneys 
as factotum job trainer and job counselor hackett wants to become 
to paralegal employment services what ray kroc was to mcdonalds 
restaurants 
hacketts corporation legalstaff may be the first in the nation 
to franchise employee placement agencies that cater exclusively to 
the legal profession 
legalstaff is the outgrowth of legal personnel services 
hacketts 15yearold placement service with offices in sacramento 
mountain view and san francisco that grossed 14 million in the 
first 10 months of this year the business provides law firms with 
permanent and temporary legal secretaries paralegals and attorneys 
hackett said franchising will allow her to tap an unmined market 
without the problem of finding the right managers and job counselors 
for new branch offices shell also earn about 25000 for every 
franchise sold her maps would crosssection cities by every 1500 
law firms making los angeles and washington worth more than 
100000 each in licensing fees 
i want to eventually run around and play colonel sandershave 
my pictures taken with the franchise owners on their 10th 
anniversary or whatever she said in an interview in her downtown 
sacramento office 
hackett 55 was a founder of the former pacific college of legal 
careers a twoyear sacramento business school which she sold in 
1984 to barclay colleges 
although legalstaff corp is barely a year old hackett said she 
expects to sell 100 franchises within three years a growth estimate 
she called very controlled already she said shes received 50 
responses to ads in the wall street journal and expects 
negotiations for the los angeles franchises to conclude by the end 
of the year 
hitching onto national trends toward a litigious society and 
service economy hackett said her specialized matchmaking service 
also meets the unique needs of the traditionsteeped legal 
profession 
the nations lawyer population is expected to burgeon to 1 
million by 1990 aggravating a chronic shortage of qualified legal 
secretaries and paralegals 
hackett said her service saves attorneys expensive time in 
finding loyal office help who are crucial to a trade that produce 
volumes of paper in often arcane language under court deadlines 
for workers looking to change law firms she said the service 
offers discretion its very difficult to change jobs as a legal 
secretary because there are no secrets you see she said you 
put the word out that youre looking for a job and the boss gets 
unhappy 
you have to be discreet about it because attorneys are very 
territorial 
because her business competes with other placement agencies for 
job applicants hackett said the service is free to job seekers she 
charges law firms the equivalent of one months salary for every 
worker placed 
hackett ventured into the personnel business in 1973 after 
working for law firms in yreka eugene ore and sacramento and the 
capitol office of gordon cologne a state assemblyman and senator 
who later became a federal judge 
she said the idea of a legal placement service dawned on her six 
years earlier when she helped a lobbyist open a law office and 
couldnt find a temporary secretary to fill in while she studied for 
midterm examinations at california state university sacramento she 
eventually earned her bachelors in english and masters in business 
administration at sacramento state 
when she opened her doors she was immediately swamped with calls 
from 52 law offices but received only five applications from job 
seekers that prompted her soon after to open her school to train 
legal secretaries and paralegals 
her second husband lewis hackett eventually followed her into 
the law field the government analystturnedattorney has his office 
next to hers 
louise hackett said franchising was a natural step for her 
business i wanted to grow i didnt want to put a lid on it its 
not exciting for your staff if your business isnt growing i 
havent noticed anyone around here getting bored

pillsbury co shareholders are the big winners 
in pillsburys decision to accept a sweetened 568 billion takeover 
bid from britains grand metropolitan plc securities analysts say 
the shareholders are the first people to profit from what i 
can tell june page an analyst at bear stearns amp co in new york 
said monday the employees of pillsbury should profit tremendously 
and ultimately the consumer 
they had no other direction to go we knew that from day one 
said craig carver an analyst at dain bosworth inc in minneapolis 
i dont know if i can answer the question why they prolonged the 
pain for so long 
pillsbury chairman philip l smith on monday defended 
managements 2month battle against the buyout bid which ended 
sunday when the minneapolisbased food and restaurant company 
accepted grand mets latest 66 a share offer 
i think the practical fact of the matter is that we got them to 
move off a very firm position smith told karetv of the twin 
cities so i dont apologize for our strategy one bit 
in a letter monday to pillsbury employees smith said the company 
was pleased with the outcome because it represented a 10 percent 
increase from grand mets original 60ashare tender offer and 
because the new ownership will allow burger king franchises a chance 
to grow 
its time to take off the gloves and get on with the next 
chapter said smith were convinced that pillsburys 
outstanding brand franchises and products will prosper with the 
enthusiastic backing and support of grand metropolitan plc 
meanwhile today pillsbury reported its profit fell 38 percent in 
the second quarter ended nov 30 and 10 percent for the first six 
months of fiscal 1989 due to a substantial onetime investment in 
the burger king advertising fund and the cost of responding to 
grand mets takeover offer 
secondquarter net income totaled 448 million or 52 cents per 
share compared with 725 million or 84 cents per share in the 
same period a year ago sales rose to 175 billion from 169 
billion 
for the six months net earnings were 1162 million or 135 
per share vs 1293 million or 150 per share during the 
comparable period of fiscal 1988 sales were 323 billion compared 
with 314 billion last year 
pillsburys board of directors approved the takeover sunday after 
a delaware judge on friday invalidated its key takeover defenses a 
poison pill plan and the proposed spinoff of its miamibased 
burger king fastfood chain 
pillsbury common stock was trading at about 39 a share the day 
before grand met launched its takeover bid oct 4 
the stock closed up 312 monday at 6537 a share 
in addition to benefiting pillsbury shareholders shares the 
grand met takeover should secure the jobs of most company employees 
but analysts said top pillsbury executives probably should start 
looking elsewhere for work analysts said 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg said he could not comment on 
whether top executives or employees would be laid off 
top management has been under fire in recent years because of 
pillsburys lackluster financial performance smith former chairman 
of general foods corp earlier this year succeeded william h 
spoor who came out of retirement to head pillsbury on an interim 
basis in february after former chairman john stafford resigned under 
pressure 
pillsburys results were depressed again this year aftertax 
profit plummeted 62 percent to 693 million on sales of 62 
billion largely because of a restructuring charge associated with 
the sale of its godfathers pizza chain and a number of other 
restaurant operations and consolidations 
pillsbury which started as pillsbury flour mills with a single 
flour mill in minneapolis in 1869 makes pillsbury flour green 
giant vegetables haagen dazs ice cream and a variety of other 
products 
in addition to burger king pillsbury owns the bennigans and 
steak amp ale restaurant chains which grand met has said it would 
sell pillsbury employs 100000 people 
grand met is a british real estate liquor and gambling 
conglomerate its us holdings include alpo dog food and pearle 
vision centers

economic growth 
the government reported the consumer price index rose 03 percent 
in november a smaller rise than some analysts expected 
in another report the government lowered its estimate of 
economic growth in the julythroughseptember period to 25 percent 
from 26 percent 
the numbers were pleasantly in line with street expectations

the reports contributed to a rally in the credit markets where 
prices of some longterm bonds were up by as much as 9 for every

but while some analysts say the conditions are right for a 
yearend stock rally others said the recent gains may be

a federal judge blocked a federal plan to 
require random drug testing of 3 million interstate drivers 
nationwide but did allow preemployment and postaccident testing 
us district judge marilyn hall patel issued a temporary 
restraining order monday against random drug testing of truckers and 
interstate bus drivers she told government lawyers she wanted to 
review how widespread substance abuse is in the trucking industry 
before a future hearing 
the material published in the federal register in support of 
testing amounted to nothing more than a welltaken diatribe 
against drug abuse in american society patel 
the program was to start wednesday but the transportation 
department did not require companies to conduct any actual testing 
until next december according to department spokesman bob marks 
more than 1 million other private employees in the rail airline 
and maritime industries are scheduled to begin random testing 
the order expires dec 30 when patel is scheduled to hear 
arguments on a longerlasting injunction against all testing 
programs affecting truckers and interstate bus drivers 
marks declined to comment on patels ruling saying the 
government would present its side on dec 30 
jeffrey king lawyer for the owneroperator independent drivers 
association of america which challenged the testing program said 
drug abuse among truck drivers is probably below the national 
average 
theres no basis to think theres a severe problem king told 
reporters he said random drug testing would sacrifice the rights 
of millions of truck drivers in hopes of catching a few 
king said his organization which has 9000 members sued on 
behalf of all 300000 independent owners of heavyduty trucks and 
small truck fleets he said patels order applies to all interstate 
truck and bus drivers but not to intercity bus drivers who have 
separate drug testing regulations 
king said he hoped to reach agreement with government lawyers on 
an extension of the ban on random drug testing before the temporary 
restraining order expires 
the transportation department testing program was announced nov 
14 transportation secretary james burnley said at the time that 
transportation employees were no more immune from drug abuse than 
the rest of society listing a series of accidents and other 
evidence

the european economic community on tuesday called 
for a gatt council ruling in the dispute over the eec ban on 
hormonetreated meat which is to take effect jan1 and threatens to 
trigger a trade war with the united states 
the united states immediately opposed the request saying the eec 
sought an instantanous legal finding that had no basis under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the eec representative john beck told the gatt council that the 
threatened us retaliatory measures a 100 percent punitive duty on 
a range of products were a further affront against the 
multilateral trade system set up by the gatt 
he said the case had wide ramifications and urged the council to 
rule on the legal issues involved and decide on remedies 
a top us trade negotiator michael samuels said the eec ban 
amounted to a unilateral decision to simply prohibit 120 million 
in us exports per year he said it was a wholesale disruption 
of traditional trade flows on alleged grounds of health but that 
the measure was not backed up by scientific evidence 
samuels said the eec had repeatedly rejected proposals to have 
the case examined by an impartial scientific body he said the 
united states remained willing to pursue the matter under any 
appropriate gatt process as long as the eec deferred the ban 
beck said the eec was aware that there were different views on 
the use of growth hormones in meat but that it had to listen to 
its consumers who did not want such meat 
canada supported the united states saying that it considered the 
eec approach excessive robert wright the canadian representative 
said in the brief debate that growth hormones were proven to be safe 
if used properly 
there was no decision on the eec request and the matter was 
expected to come up again at the next gatt council session in 
february 
in other business brazil formally demanded that a gatt panel be 
set up to rule in its dispute with the united states over punitive 
us duties imposed in response to an alleged lack of brazilian 
patent protection for us pharmaceutical products 
brazilian ambassador rubens ricupero said the us retaliation 
was in clear violation of gatt rules and in breach of commitments 
not to impose new unilateral trade restrictions during the current 
uruguay round of world trade liberalization talks 
samuels said there had been no alternative left to defending 
legitimate us interests but that the measures would be lifted as 
soon as brazil acts upon the us request to ensure full patent 
proection 
the measures cover 39 million worth of brazils trade with the 
united states an amount which samuels said reflects the damage 
suffered by the us pharmaceutical industry 
twentyeight countries backed brazils position including the 
eec and switzerland which said also that the case argued for action 
on patents in the uruguay round talks 
as the united states opposed the brazilian request up a panel 
the council did not take a decision but was expected to discuss the 
case again at its february session

curt carlson 74 recently stepped up the pace 
rather than growing his business at just 15 percent a year which 
would double volume in five years he publicly announced a goal of 
175 percent a year 
at that rate carlson cos a personally owned 75company 
conglomerate based in minnetonka minn would double its annual 
volume to 9 billion in 1992 already it is as large as some 
fortune 100 companies 
unlike such companies however carlson remains entrepreneurial 
constantly setting sales goals publicly stating them so that there 
is no retreat then setting new goals it has never missed a 
fiveyear sales goal 
curtis leroy carlson was selling soap to grocery stores in 1938 
when he founded gold bond stamp co constantly diversifying into 
other businesses restlessly setting goals he pushed company sales 
to 1 billion in 1978 
averaged out over the 40 years that growth came to 33 percent a 
year compounded the company was huge now and growth of that sort 
doesnt come as easily as in the smaller days for one thing you 
have to seek public funds 
so said carlson in 1978 he thought it best to settle for 15 
percent a year for the next five years in 1982 sales reached 2 
billion another 15 percent fiveyear plan began in 1987 the 
company reached 4 billion 
ever the entrepreneur carlson then looked at his cash flow and 
decided there was enough money coming in to step up the pace to 175 
percent thats the goal each year through 1992 theres no resting 
at carlson cos 
the conglomerate now has four major divisions hospitality 
incentives travel and promotion among the companies are the highly 
rated radisson hotel chain tgi fridays restaurants ask mr foster 
travel service the oldest and largest in america ef macdonalds 
incentive travel carlson learning co 
it is forever in transition continually evolving in its 
evolution the company follows no rigid plan says carlson i hire 
top people and they grow the company he says were pulled 
ahead by big horses 
enthusiasm imagination innovation and motivation are important 
elements in carlsons type of management and goalsetting is basic 
to all of them it began with little selfreminders in curts 
wallet now its institutionalized 
to succeed you must eat sleep and dream your goals and 
quotas he says its a fact an absolute fact you will never 
make as much progress without targets as you will with goal 
setting 
nevertheless he calls himself cautious he seeks to grow in 
bite sizes i dont shoot the wad that way if things dont 
turn out as expected you get a little blip in the earnings that 
can be corrected 
incentives spur achievement and carlson officers who achieve are 
given such things as firstclass 17day tours of hawaii new 
zealand and australia throughout the year spouses are kept informed 
of how well their mates are doing not wanting to be left out they 
spur their mates to higher achievement 
the company remains the very same as it was 50 years ago in at 
least one respect it is sales driven you build as fast as you 
can said carlson the other day as soon as a salesman is making 
his pay you put on another 
every month carlson examines the income statement and balance 
sheet for each of the 75 companies he watches the bottom line the 
pursuit of goals should he suspect problems he asks for backup 
information and explanations 
so successful are the carlson management techniques that some of 
his people would set and probably reach even higher goals but 
says carlson you can only grow as fast as the money comes in 
to open a new fridays for example might take 2 million i 
cannot open 40 of them without taking money away from others in a 
sense therefore the big growth goals are probably compromises 
perhaps its just as well because the goals are always publicly 
stated as a consequence they are avidly watched by the media fail 
to achieve a goal and everyone in town will know about it 
you burn your bridges behind you said carlson the magic 
motivator we give a figure and we had better make it because 
everyone is watching

employees are packing lastminute 
christmas orders at the huge warehouse belonging to 
bookofthemonth club inc in the final chapter of a bestselling 
year for the company 
lawrence m crutcher president of the nations largest book 
club said orders for 2 million books in december will help produce 
annual sales of about 200 million up 12 percent from last year 
we had a long slow start but it has been a good fall 
crutcher said monday in an interview at the mammoth facility just 
south of harrisburg 
as a subsidiary of time inc bookofthemonth club does not 
reveal exact sales figures for its books videotapes or casettes 
but crutcher said the club received about 3 million book orders 
in november at the height of the christmas rush prompting the 
company to increase its workforce from 600 to 800 
he attributed the surge partly to the release of many of the 
years best books late in the fall and partly to the holiday crunch 
fifteen percent to 20 percent of bookofthemonth club sales are 
gifts crutcher said 
weve pretty well dug out from the orders we caught up last 
week he said 
bookofthemonth club founded in 1926 with 4000 charter 
members now has 27 million members 
in addition to the main book club the company offers seven 
speciality clubs for readers with interests in business cooking 
history sailing mystery novels childrens books and paperbacks 
bookofthemonth club also has been moving into the videotape 
market in recent years often marketing videos as companions to 
books the club offers crutcher said 
in february for instance bookofthemonth club plans to offer 
two videos about martin luther king along with the months main 
selection of parting the waters a new book on the civil rights 
movement 
videos and audio cassettes now account for about 5 percent of the 
book clubs business crutcher said 
they are not a substitution sale a lot of us have been nervous 
about this but it hasnt hurt book sales he said 
bookofthemonth clubs sales have more than tripled in the last 
20 years showing that reading is alive and well crutcher said 
crutcher who will become chief executive officer in january 
said the threefold increase of college graduates since world war ii 
to about 23 percent of the population has helped the companys 
growth 
its not as explosive as cable tv but its a good growth 
business he said 
during a reporters visit recently to bookofthemonth clubs 
labryinth of offices employees were answering telephones 
processing checks and sorting the 150000 to 200000 pieces of mail 
the club has been receiving daily 
workers also stacked books in a threestories high warehouse 
holding from 8 million to 10 million volumes on metal scaffolds 
stretching hundreds of yards 
if you cant find something in here you enjoy reading you 
cant find it anywhere said marty mehring human resources 
manager at the plant 
orders received monday will probably reach the buyer by 
christmas according to crutcher who said 99 percent of the orders 
received are processed within 24 hours

in an interview that he supported a womans right to choose to have 
an abortion 
that appeared to be at odds with a statement released by bushs 
transition office last week after the two men met in washington the 
statement said sullivan had assured the vice president he shared 
bushs antiabortion views 
even though sullivan a friend of bush and his wife was reported 
to have said that he like bush opposes the use of federal funds 
for abortions the weekend interview threw an obstacle in his path 
to the cabinet transition and congressional sources said 
the atlanta constitution reported today that sullivan had said 
monday night he was having trouble getting calls to the white house 
returned 
i have simply concluded that as a result of my not receiving a 
call back the things have been put off and hopefully its not 
anything worse than that 
sullivan told the newspaper his stand on abortion is private and 
he does not intend to disagree publicly with bushs antiabortion 
views 
he said he believes there should be that right to abortions 
at the same time i am aware of the fact that the 
presidentelect feels that that should not be the case and i would 
have to as secretary should i be appointed carry out his 
policies 
a bush transition official said that bush had not formally 
offered the post to sullivan despite widespread speculation and 
despite sullivans own comments 
the appointment of jack kemp to head the housing and urban 
development department was announced monday cheering conservatives 
who have long viewed the new york congressman as a champion of their 
causes but kemp said he does not plan to be conservative in 
approach when it comes to fighting for housing programs that work 
i want to wage war on poverty i dont want to wage war on 
congress the nineterm congressman said i want it known that 
you cannot balance the budget off the backs of the poor 
bush called kemp a former rival for the republican presidential 
nomination a man of ideas who will lead his administrations 
war on poverty 
asked if he had assurances that the former professional football 
quarterback would shed his critics role bush said i hope he 
hasnt shed it i want the objectivity of his judgment and 
knowing jack ill get it 
kemp long has been an advocate of urban enterprise zones to spur 
investment in inner cities and has called for selling public housing 
units to tenants at low cost he said he would be an activist hud 
secretary 
as of monday the vice president had filled eight cabinet posts 
and had six to go 
his prospective choice for transportation secretary skinner is 
chairman of the regional transportation authority of northeastern 
illinois the nations second largest mass transportation system 
a former us attorney in chicago and a pilot skinner 50 was 
bushs campaign director for illinois 
meanwhile sources said bush was also ready to name becton as 
secretary of the department of veterans affairs an agency recently 
raised to cabinet level becton currently heads the federal 
emergency management agency 
bush who has said he hopes to finish his cabinet by christmas 
also has yet to name his secretaries of labor interior and energy 
sources said the two leading candidates for the labor slot are 
patricia diaz dennis a democrat and member of the federal 
communications commission who once served on the national labor 
relations board and william kilberg a washington labor lawyer and 
solicitor in the labor department under president nixon 
bush on monday did give some hints on his choice of energy 
secretary suggesting he is leaning more towards someone with 
experience in nuclear energy rather than one with expertise in the 
oil and gas industry 
he did not elaborate but the disclosure seemed to knock some 
contenders out of consideration including former louisiana rep 
henson moore

presidentelect bush emphasizing his 
opposition to tax increases appointed republican paul laxalt and 
democrat thomas ashley on tuesday to a national commission 
struggling to find a formula for reducing the federal budget deficit 
i intend to hold the line on taxes bush said there are a 
lot of people around saying i cant do that 
laxalt onetime governor of nevada served two terms in the us 
senate before joining a washington law firm ashley a longtime 
personal friend of bushs spent 26 years in the house of 
representatives and was a topranking member of the banking 
committee he now is president of the association of bank holding 
companies a lobbying group which represents the countrys largest 
banks 
the appointments put the national economic commission at its full 
strength of 14 people the panel was created last year after the 
stock markets 508point plunge 
some business leaders said laxalts appointment diminished the 
possibility that the commission would recommend tax increases to cut 
the deficit 
laxalt is the type of guy who has read george bushs lips and 
from everything i know about him he would be against taxes and would 
want to look on the spending side for deficit reductions said 
richard rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce he 
has been a good fiscal conservative 
tempering skepticism that he voiced earlier bush said some 
have suggested i am something less than enthralled with the national 
economic commission thats not right 
bush who takes office on jan 20 made that comment in a meeting 
with about 30 business leaders who pledged their support for a 
program of reducing the deficit by cutting spending rather than 
raising taxes he issued a written statement later announcing the 
appointment of laxalt and ashley 
he noted that his announcement came only one day after the 
electoral college ratified the nov 8 vote electing him president 
the swiftness with which i am making these appointments 
underscores the importance i place on the need to reduce the federal 
budget deficit he said 
i believe that the experience these two public servants will 
bring to the panel will add to the quality of its deliberations 
he said 
at the beginning of the meeting with the business leaders bush 
called the deficit a tough problem 
ill just do my level best to send signals to the international 
markets that were serious that were projecting it downward 
firmly and i really believe that once that happens the adverse 
psychology that is forcing interest rates up beyond where in my view 
they ought to be will turn around he said 
i think once world markets think that were definitively on a 
track without exception to have the deficit obliterated in whatever 
number of years it is that in itself a bipartisan answer that 
in itself will be enormously beneficial to world markets he said 
in the past bush has appeared suspicious of the national 
economic commission warning that it might try to promote a 
taxincrease plan to cut the deficit 
but bush said tuesday he was looking forward to hearing from the 
group and listening to its suggestions there are some very good 
people on there democrats and republicans theyre serious serious 
people so im not looking for a battle with the them and there 
wont be one because theyve been most cooperative since the 
election in terms of wanting to at least have from our key economic 
appointees their views

a late selling wave left stock prices broadly 
lower today as the market ran into resistance in its bid to extend 
its recent rally 
the market appeared to take some early encouragement from a pair 
of economic reports that seemed to signal low inflation and moderate 
economic growth 
the government reported the consumer price index rose 03 percent 
in november and lowered its estimate of economic growth in the 
julythroughseptember period to 25 percent from 26 percent 
the reports contributed to a rally in the credit markets where 
prices of some longterm bonds were up by as much as 9 for every 
1000 in face value while interest rates pulled back 
but analysts said profittaking eroded some of the stock markets 
early gains and some observers warned the recent rally had not been 
broadbased enough to be sustained 
the skeptics note that shortterm interest rates near 9 percent 
are making treasury issues such as oneyear bills attractive 
compared with the uncertain yields on stocks

there is just too much good economic news around 
to suit the economic pessimists and it has got to stop soon or 
theyll have to reevaluate their scenarios 
the good news is coming from every direction from the commerce 
department and consumers and retailers and purchasing agents and 
even from the federal reserve board which deferred an expected 
increase in the discount rate 
the latest retail sales showed a 11 percent improvement in 
november car sales were good housing construction was at the 
highest rate in seven months the purchasing agents foresee strong 
noninflationary growth in 1989 
the november report on producer prices shows they rose only 
threetenths of 1 percent for the third month in a row even though 
they probed deeply into the guts of the report inflationfearers 
found little grist for their mill 
the latest and broadest measurement of the us trade deficit 
showed a sharp improvement in the third quarter of the year 
reducing the gap to its narrowest in three years 
it might seem hard to argue with items such as these but that is 
not so there is a peculiar attitude toward good news today the 
commonest one being that good news is bad because it will bring on 
inflation and recession 
never mind that neither is in sight just remember if you will 
that in the view of some economists inflation and recession are 
everpresent threats even in the best of times like sin they 
attack the weak and unprepared 
that being so you must forever flagellate the economy during 
good times in order to ward off the threat the economy should not 
be indulged because it is inherently weak and subject to excesses 
that can destroy it beware 
in this environment improved retail sales are viewed as an 
indication of an economy overheating and heading toward inflation 
news of the improved trade deficit had been broadcast only 
minutes when the oil analysts warned that higher prices for that 
product would slow and even reverse the improvement 
the continued lowering of the jobless rate and the continued 
expansion of the work force the pessimists said was very very 
dangerous when you reach jobless levels of 5 percent to 55 
percent they say wages soon will rise 
sharply rising wages would mean inflation of course and so 
would a continued high level for plant usage when you use up your 
most efficient plant space you cant make more goods except at a 
higher price beware 
the latest report by the national association of purchasing 
management in which members overwhelmingly say the economy will 
improve next year was said to be naive 
higher car sales just cant continue without rebates said some 
of the auto analysts the news of heightened activity in housing was 
immediately followed by economists warning that high interest rates 
would put that to an end 
there are enormous problems facing the us economy budget 
deficits trade deficits low savings rates excessive and probably 
very poor credit banking problems tax and revenue issues the 
dollar competitiveness 
so why is the news about people working companies producing 
deficits shrinking prices remaining constant and houses abuilding 
accompanied by warnings 
sooner or later the inflation and recession watchers will have 
their way because economies are cyclical expansions follow and 
precede contractions the lines on the graph waver seldom are they 
straight as in straight up 
the inflationrecession watchers know this and they know too 
that you do not worry enough about it they feel they must atone for 
your inattention to worry their motto is if you only knew youd 
worry more 
seven years of uninterrupted economic expansion has left them 
dismayed disturbed and disgruntled and habitually inclined to 
growl bah humbug 
and so at christmas say the good people of america the same 
to you

an encouraging report on inflation tuesday added 
a spark of life to some financial markets and eased concerns about 
higher interest rates but most analysts remained wary about the 
economys direction 
the dollar rallied against most major currencies in foreign 
exchange trading here and abroad while bond prices headed sharply 
higher 
the treasurys bellwether 30year issue rose nearly 10 per 
1000 face amount while its yield which moves inversely to price 
fell below 9 percent for the first time in a week 
on wall street however stocks declined the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials which shot up around 14 points at the opening 
closed down 661 to 216607 
economists said the markets were encouraged by a labor department 
report that showed inflation on the consumer level slowed in 
november to an annual rate of just 3 percent a drop in clothing 
prices and stabilized prices for food contributed to the decline 
the department said 
with only december left another month similar to november could 
enable the reagan administration to finish its last year in office 
meeting its inflation target of 43 percent for 1988 down slightly 
from 1987s 44 percent level 
also easing inflation worries was a commerce department report 
that the gross national product the broadest measure of economic 
health expanded at a moderate annual rate of 25 percent in the 
third quarter due to the summer drought 
for the same period the department reported that aftertax 
corporate profits rose 39 percent down from a robust 89 percent 
increase the previous quarter 
low inflation is good for all the markets it means the 
economic recovery was sustainable and longlived said maury 
harris chief economist for painewebber inc 
it eases the pressure on interest rates which have risen sharply 
in recent weeks partly on inflationary fears 
inflation is considered the nemesis of the financial markets 
particularly the credit markets because it erodes the value of 
fixedincome securities sending yields higher to compensate for the 
loss 
that depresses the stock market which competes for investor 
money and it often hurts the dollar because as prices of stocks and 
bonds slip foreigners become less willing to exchange their 
currencies for dollars to buy those us securities 
talk around wall street lately had centered around whether the 
federal reserve will raise its discount rate a key shortterm rate 
to prevent the economy from overheating and inflation from heading 
up 
the discount rate is the interest the fed charges on loans to 
member banks and savings institutions and its considered the most 
direct vehicle for the central bank to make its credit policies 
known most economists had predicted the rate would be raised 05 
percentage point to 7 percent 
however tuesdays inflation and gnp reports put some of those 
discussions to rest at least temporarily 
some people who jumped on the interestratesgoingup 
fedtightening bandwagon found out they were going on it 
prematurely said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international thats what the markets are 
telling you 
carol a stone a senior economist for nomura securities 
international inc admits she was part of that majority group 
we had expected that given the strength in some of the other 
economic numbers lately that wed see the fed raising the discount 
rate pretty soon she said well this economic data suggests 
that they may not have to do that right away although theres still 
a good possibility after the first of the year that wed see that 
happen 
there are some people that are expecting a rise in the 
discount rate and the banks prime rate before years end added 
kevin flanagan a money market economist for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
brusca said that while the latest reports point to less inflation 
and slightly slower economic growth a laundry list of other 
factors point in another direction 
the dollar remains weak overall business capacity use rates 
are high and rising and we have a very low unemployment rate he 
said oil prices are also rising

most tolls on the st lawrence seaway will 
increase by 45 percent in each of the next two years officials of 
the binational waterway said tuesday 
the higher tolls being levied in 1989 and 1990 are needed to help 
the system keep pace with inflation said us seaway administrator 
james l emery and william a oneil president of the seaway 
authority of canada 
however tolls for humanitarianaid shipments will be eliminated 
and lumber shipments will be reclassified as bulk cargo and 
therefore have a lower toll officials said these moves are 
intended to spur increased movement of those two cargos 
the combined toll for general cargo on the seaway in 1989 is 
286 per metric ton while the rate for bulk cargo is 133 per ton 
to be qualify for the lower rate the lumber must be timber or 
logs sawed or split and rough or dressed into various sizes for use 
as beams joists rafters studs boards of planks 
there is an abundance of forest land and wood product 
industries in the western great lakes region oneil said the 
seaway is a natural transportation route for this virtually untapped 
market 
however he said the seaway handled only 9400 metric tons of 
lumber shipments in 1987 and the us and canadian agencies are 
hoping for a significant increase in the amount of lumber shipped 
through the system

gold prices fell marginally in new york after mostly rising 
abroad republic national bank of new york quoted bullion at 41390 
a troy ounce as of 4 pm est down from 414 late monday 
currency strategists attributed the dollars rise largely to

repatriate 1988 earnings 
there is always good corporate demand for dollars in the last 
couple of weeks of the year said stuart yannalfo senior foreign 
exchange trader at refco inc a new york commodities futures firm 
others said persistent speculation that the federal reserve would 
tighten interest rates in the united states raised demand for 
dollars higher interest rates make dollardenominated holdings 
worth more 
in addition an oil price hike in the energy markets supported 
the us currency since most oil contracts are priced in dollars a 
rise in oil prices theoretically raises demand for dollars to pay

high interest rates and slumping financial markets 
are casting scrooges shadow over christmas for many british 
businesses and workers 
retailers say high interest rates the governments strategy for 
fighting inflation are depressing sales and prompting preholiday 
price markdowns 
industrial companies say their profits are feeling a pinch too 
and investment firms have made major layoffs in the face of low 
trading volumes and fierce competition 
the good news is that recent economic reports show the higher 
interest rates are beginning to slow the overheating economy that 
means rates might not go higher 
the bad news is that retailers are weathering a slowdown at what 
traditionally is one of the busiest times of the year 
trade is not what it usually is before christmas people are 
being more cautious with their money because of higher interest 
rates said a spokeswoman for the oxford street association whose 
120 members operate stores on londons main shopping street 
angela mostaani a 36yearold secretary buying christmas 
wrapping paper said higher interest rates were affecting her 
shopping 
we bought our first house in april when the interest rate was 
8 percent im trying to buy less mrs mostaani said 
to slow spending chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson pushed 
interest rates to 13 percent from junes decadelow 75 percent 
mortgage rates have risen to 1275 percent from 115 percent and are 
expected to reach 135 percent in january 
the annual inflation rate has picked up to 64 percent from 33 
percent in january 
paul bayliss a 30yearold accountant shopping in the same store 
as mrs mostaani also said he was worried about higher interest 
rates but added well not let it spoil christmas anyway 
some stores are taking prechristmas markdowns to move 
merchandise liberty and co a clothing and fabrics retailer said 
it has reduced some womens designer clothes up to onethird 
its been a very difficult season for ladies fashions said 
kathryn dighton a liberty spokeswoman 
but she added were experiencing a particularly good christmas 
season we expect sales to be up between 12 percent and 14 percent 
throughout the store 
meanwhile investment firms in the city londons financial 
district are laying off people because of competition and low 
trading volumes the governments tight grip on spending also has 
hurt the market in gilts or british government bonds 
morgan grenfell group plc announced dec 6 it was shutting its 
gilt and equity marketmaking operations cutting 450 jobs just 
before the holidays 
it was the biggest single cutback announced since the october 
1987 stock market crash and big bang the 1986 deregulation of 
britains financial markets 
separately the british textile group coats viyella plc warned 
wednesday its pretax profit could fall as much as 40 percent in 
1988 mostly because of high interest rates and the strong british 
pound 
but some britons have been encouraged by three economic reports 
released this past week which show the governments tactics appear 
to be working 
the government reported last friday that the annual inflation 
rate held steady at 64 percent in november 
last thursday it reported the underlying annual growth of 
average earnings fell to 9 percent in october from 925 percent in 
september earlier it said retail sales fell 05 percent in 
november 
the retail sales figures we saw at the beginning of the week 
were certainly helpful to show that demand is coming off a bit 
said economist derek scott of the investment firm barclays de zoete 
wedd ltd 
economists now are expecting inflation to peak at between 725 
percent and 75 percent next year rather than at 8 percent or 
higher scott said 
but he added we wont really see evidence of a slowdown 
until the new year

some late afternoon selling left stock prices 
broadly lower tuesday frustrating the markets bid to extend its 
latest rally 
prices opened higher appearing to take some encouragement from 
new government reports that indicated continuing low inflation and 
moderate economic growth but profittaking eroded the gains as the 
day progressed 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had risen nearly 
40 points over the past two sessions wound up falling 661 to close 
at 216607 
the widelywatched indicator of bluechip stocks had been up 
nearly 10 points at midday but gave ground steadily in the final 
hour of the session 
declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
652 up 845 down and 515 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 16109 million 
shares down from 16225 million monday 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 19692 million shares 
as the market opened the dow jones industrials moved up about 14 
points during the first few minutes of trading but the bluechip 
market gauge was unable to sustain the advance and soon dropped 
below its postcrash closing high of 218350 reached oct 21 
the early rally was a carryover from yesterdays strength 
said rao chalasani chief investment strategist for prescott ball amp 
turben inc in cleveland but the breadth of the market was poor 
before trading began the government reported the consumer price 
index rose 03 percent in november and lowered its estimate of 
economic growth in the julythroughseptember period to 25 percent 
from 26 percent 
the reports tended to soothe worries that the federal reserve 
would move quickly to encourage even higher interest rates 
the bond market rallied as prices of some longterm issues rose 
as much as 9 for every 1000 in face value and interest rates fell 
but analysts said profittaking eroded some of the stock markets 
early gains driving prices lower 
the skeptics noted that shortterm interest rates are hovering 
near 9 percent and are making yields on treasury issues such as 
oneyear bills attractive compared with the uncertain yields on 
stocks 
chalasani noted that the dow jones industrials have risen about 
150 points since midnovember and said he suspects the yearend 
rally may pretty much be over 
but lawrence r helfand executive vice president at rodman amp 
renshaw inc in chicago said the some further gains could be in 
store if stocks other than the bluechip issues attract some buying 
interest 
inco ltd the canadian metals mining company which began trading 
exdividend recently was the most active issue on the nyse rising 
1 to 26 a company spokesman kurt barnes declined to speculate 
about reasons for the price rise or activity 
among other active issues jp morgan lost to 35 tiger

first fidelity bancorp fell 1 to 26 the company announced last 
week it expected to lose 145 million to 190 million in the current 
quarter and some analysts suspect the companys financial problems 
may not be over

western industrialized nations are likely to 
experience moderately low inflation rates over the next two years 
but the threat of accelerated inflation and higher interest rates is 
just over the horizon the oecd said tuesday 
in the latest issue of its semiannual economic outlook the 
secretariat of the organization for economic cooperation and 
development suggested that some tightening of fiscal policy as well 
as monetary policy may be necessary in most countries to combat 
inflationary pressures 
the secretariat also predicted that the currentaccount trade 
deficits of the three biggest oecd countries the united states 
japan and west germany will remain unacceptably high 
the parisbased oecd cautioned that although there appears to be 
no imminent problem it would be unwise to conclude that external 
trade imbalances no longer represent an important threat to

a house panel voiced tentative support tuesday 
for a proposal to allow the securities and exchange commission to 
become selffinancing by tapping millions of dollars in annual fees 
the money would help boost the secs limited resources for such 
battles as its securities fraud case against the giant investment 
firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
sec chairman david s ruder told a subcommittee hearing chaired 
by rep john dingell dmich that the drexel case dramatized the 
paltry resources of his agency where there is a 20 percent annual 
turnover of staff lawyers who are lured to private firms by fatter 
salaries and better working conditions 
the sec in september filed a civil suit charging drexel and some 
of its employees including junk bond chief michael milken with 
insider trading stock manipulation and other violations stemming 
from the ongoing wall street insider trading scandal 
the case has yet to go to court and drexel has spent 75 million 
in legal fees and nearly 70 million in public relations and 
advertising costs more than the secs current budget of 1426 
million the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations was told 
pitting little more than a dozen of the regulatory agencys 
poorly paid lawyers against more than 100 highpriced wall street 
attorneys representing drexel is like trying to fight godzilla 
with a slingshot said rep ron wyden dore 
ruder endorsed proposals in a new sec staff study to allow the 
agency to become selffinanced by using the fees it collects for 
securities registrations transactions and various filings these 
fees which totaled 248 million in fiscal 1988 are deposited in 
the treasurys general fund and are not available to the agency 
dingell said that in the past few years fee revenues have been 
more than double or nearly double the secs annual appropriation 
it is my firm view that something must be done to address the 
growing deficiencies in the resources available to the sec to carry 
out its statutory responsibilities dingell said it is also my 
view that something will be done 
ruder and several subcommittee members agreed that the most 
controversial proposal would be to create a permanent sec trust and 
revolving fund financed by fee collections which the agency could 
spend under special authority of a congressional oversight committee 
the selffinancing concept drew praise from democrats and 
republicans on the panel 
wyden cited the secs decision in september not to seek 
prosecution of suspected securities violations in the 225 billion 
default on municipal bonds issued by the washington public power 
supply system because of a lack of enforcement staff 
the lesson is if youre going to mess up mess up big wyden 
said the fact is the sec just doesnt have the resources to go 
after these big cases 
ruder said a selffinancing mechanism would give the sec 
flexibility to cope with the growing automation of securities 
markets increasingly complex financial packages and trading 
techniques sophiscated schemes for market manipulation and insider 
trading escalating corporate takeover attempts and the rapid growth 
in us and foreign securities markets 
enforcement of securities laws has suffered because of sec staff 
problems such as starting salaries of 27716 for young lawyers who 
can command as much as 71000 in new york law firms ruder said 
we have evidence of cases we could bring but dont because we 
dont have the resources to do it ruder said he refused to cite 
specifics but said some of these cases involve penny stock 
fraud perpetrated against small investors by boiler room 
operations that move from city to city 
in another matter ruder refused to comment on reports quoting 
drexel chief executive fred joseph that negotiations with federal 
prosecutors had broken down and that his firm might be hit with a 
criminal racketeering indictment soon

coffee futures prices made their most dramatic surge in five 
consecutive sessions of advances overrunning the daily trading 
limit tuesday amid growing concerns over a lengthening strike by 
dockworkers in brazil 
the longer the strike remains in place said arthur stevenson 
of prudentialbache securities inc the more explosive this will 
get 
on other markets cocoa moved in sympathy with coffee and 
registered sharp gains platinum came off the floor and posted 
moderate gains after three straight days of reverses and the 
january contract for crude oil futures skyrocketed 142 when the 
brokerage arm of a large commodity trading house got caught selling 
the market short on the day the contract expired 
coffee prices rocketed 1035 cents and 1058 cents for the spot 
march and may contracts respectively and settled up the 6cent 
daily trading limit for the remaining deferred contracts at the new 
york coffee sugar and cocoa exchange march closed at 15543 a 
pound a high for the contract 
stevenson said the singlebiggest development tuesday was a 
report that a regional court near the key brazilian port of santos 
affirmed the legality of the strike that began dec 13 
but several other factors were underpinning coffees dramatic 
rise in recent days 
there is concern about the production outlook insufficient 
rain in some parts of brazil the worlds largest producer and too 
much in colombia he said 
and when you put those together and then consider that the 
court decision leaves the workers under less pressure to settle 
quickly he added youve got the kind of explosive market we 
saw today 
cocoa meanwhile was up 58 to 82 a ton with march at 1524 
it was the biggest day for cocoa in ages said stevenson 
there was psychological spillover from the coffee pit and the port 
strike has some impact there too 
and he added there is some indication the ivory coast 
the worlds leading cocoa producer is going to tighten supply by 
removing some from the market 
platinum climbed as high as 15 an ounce before settling 5 to 
650 an ounce higher on the new york mercantile exchange the 
december contract closed at 53580 a steep decline from the 600 
level the precious metal topped last week before ford motor corp 
announced it had developed an automotive catalytic converter that 
did not require the use of platinum 
people are coming back to platinum but there are no bets how 
this will go until we get a complete story said steve chronowitz 
vice president and director of futures research for smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york 
how much will this actually cut demand will general motors and 
chrysler and europe and japan follow suit those are questions we 
wont know answers to for a while he added but the worst may 
be over 
the rest of the precious metals were quiet gold settled 40 cents 
to 50 cents lower at the comex with december at 414 a troy ounce 
silver 17 cents to 21 cents lower with december at 6093 a troy 
ounce copper was 90 cent lower to 315 cents higher with december 
at 15890 a pound 
crude oil futures at the new york mercantile exchange rose only 
by 10 cents to 38 cents except for the spot contract in january 
which jumped 142 to 1773 a barrel jump 
the spotmonth aberration resulted because a brokerage firm 
rumored to be part of grain giant cargill inc had sold the market 
short expecting a drop in prices and was forced to buy contracts 
to fulfill obligations on delivery day 
somebody got caught between tornadoes said energy analyst 
who declined to be identified and had to buy like crazy it seems 
to happen every time delivery day comes along 
heating oil settled 047 cent to 072 cent higher with january 
at 5147 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was up 013 cent to 
035 cent with january at 4555 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices posted acrosstheboard losses 
on the chicago board of trade 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents lower with december at 434 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 267 
a bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents lower with december at 
221 a bushel and soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents lower with 
january at 786 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures prices were mixed at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle settled 25 cent lower to 08 cent higher with 
december at 7365 cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent lower 
to 10 cent higher with january at 8382 cents a pound live hogs 
were 30 cent lower to 110 cents higher with december at 4574

the food and restaurant company agreed sunday to accept a 
sweetened 568 billion takeover bid from the british conglomerate 
which had made its first offer on oct 4

onetime investment in the burger king advertising fund and the cost 
of responding to grand mets takeover bid

or 17 cents per share in the quarter while aftertax costs related 
to the tender offer totaled 132 million or 15 cents per share

opportunities in pillsbury and my regret is that i wont be able to 
bring those about 
after months of resistance pillsburys board of directors 
approved the buyout on sunday after a judge in delaware on friday 
blocked its two key takeover defenses a poison pill stock issue 
plan and the proposed spinoff of miamibased burger king

a federal investigation of fraud at the zzzz 
best rug shampooing company continues despite the conviction of 
owner barry minkow and his accountant the us attorney said 
tuesday 
investors in the company and other victims of its scams are 
unlikely to get back any of the 65 million to 70 million that 
disappeared into the firm us attorney robert bonner told a news 
conference 
its a sad fact that in many of these fraud cases there isnt 
much left when it is all over bonner said certainly much of it 
was dissipated on the lifestyle that mr minkow led 
minkow 22 became familiar to millions of people through 
appearances in television ads and talk shows portraying himself to 
the public and the investment community as a teenage supersalesman 
whose thriving company began in his parents garage in the san 
fernando valley 
he was convicted last week of 57 counts of conspiracy securities 
fraud mail fraud and credit card fraud 
jurors rejected his defense that mafia figures had forced him to 
swindle investors by falsely claiming his company was making a 
fortune restoring fire and waterdamaged buildings 
minkows accountant norman rothberg 52 was convicted monday of 
taking a bribe from minkow to cover up the fraud ten others 
connected with zzzz best have pleaded guilty to various charges 
since the firm collapsed in july 1987 
bonner said his office the fbi and the internal revenue service 
were following leads that surfaced at the trial including minkows 
claims that he was forced into crime by mobsters who had interests 
in his company 
the full range of individuals who may have participated is 
going to be looked into bonner said were not ruling out i 
cant say that none of these figures have ties to organized crime 
bonner and other officials at the news conference refused to say 
who was under investigation when charges might be forthcoming or 
even if they were sure they would amass enough evidence for further 
charges 
possible crimes connected with zzzz best include tax fraud bank 
fraud and securities fraud through manipulation of the companys 
stock price bonner said 
the officials refused to comment on whether minkow had discussed 
helping in the investigation in return for a reduction in his 
sentence which could be a maximum of 403 years 
asked to comment on accusations by los angeles police chief daryl 
gates that zzzz best may have laundered money for east coast 
mobsters the us attorney said that aspect of the case was in the 
hands of local authorities 
theres certainly some smoke there he said 
the police departments top spokesman cmdr william booth said 
this week that investigation continues 
one of the prosecutors assistant us attorney james asperger 
said that of the 65 million to 70 million believed invested in or 
paid to zzzz best most seems to have been spent by the highliving 
minkow and other defendants virtually none appears to be available 
for restitution to investors bankers brokers and other victims 
whom minkow numbered in the thousands asperger said

a texaco inc subsidiary has agreed to 
pay 895 million to settle a state complaint that it improperly 
stored hazardous wastes at its bakersfield facility state officials 
said tuesday 
attorney general john van de kamp and state health director 
kenneth kizer called the settlement the largest ever reached under 
californias hazardous waste law and possibly the biggest of its 
kind in the country 
the severity of the penalties imposed in this case are matched 
by the seriousness of the violations and by the potential threat to 
public health and safety van de kamp said at a capitol news 
conference 
he said state investigators found about 5000 steel drums 
containing hazardous waste at the texaco refining and marketing inc 
facility in northwest bakersfield about 2000 of the drums were 
leaking corroded or open and more than 3000 of them were not 
labeled he said 
van de kamp and kizer said they had no indication that the waste 
had leaked into groundwater but van de kamp said the situation at 
the refinery could have been disasterous if there was a fire 
texaco spokesmen said the waste posed no significant risk to 
either our employees the environment or the community they said 
the company agreed to the settlement to avoid the costs of fighting 
the case in court 
while technically hazardous waste the vast majority of the 
materials were relatively inert and would not be considered to be 
hazardous outside california said robert hammond a spokesman for 
texaco usa 
furthermore procedures exist in the california regulations 
under which texaco could have sought and we are confident obtained 
approvals from the department of health services to treat most of 
the material involved as nonhazardous 
hammond and bill bresnick an attorney for texaco said most of 
the material stored in the drums already was there when texaco 
purchased property next to its facility from tosco corp in 1986 
most of the drums have been removed texaco officials said the 
company is required to remove the remaining drums within 90 days 
state officials said 
under the settlement texaco refining and marketing will pay 45 
million in civil penalties 500000 to cover administrative and 
investigative costs and at least 395 million to reduce waste 
production and improve waste handling procedures at its facilities 
kizer said the violations found by state inspectors included 
storing waste for longer than allowed without a permit storing 
incompatible wastes next to each other storing waste in unlabeled 
containers and storing waste in open and unsafe conditions 
according to the complaint the department first found improper 
storage of waste at the site during a partial inspection in 
september 1986 the complaint was filed last week

inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3 percent 
last month and economic growth did the same in the third quarter 
the government said tuesday in reports that eased fears an 
overheating economy is about to trigger a wageprice spiral 
seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose just 025 percent in 
november compared with a 04 percent increase in october the labor 
department said before the seasonal adjustments prices rose only 
01 percent 
the monthly inflation figure was rounded off in the departments 
announcement to 03 percent although the actual figure was 025 
percent 
clothing prices that had jumped 4 percent in september and 
october with the introduction of fall and winter fashions dipped 03 
percent last month and food prices showed no increase in november 
for the first time since february 
analysts who had been seeing harbingers of inflation everywhere 
in recent economic data described as amazing and remarkable 
the continued lack of it in the governments monthly report on the 
consumer price index 
the new figures slowed the annual inflation rate from 46 percent 
for the first 10 months of the year to 44 percent for the first 11 
months the same as it was for all of 1987 
with only december left another month similar to november could 
enable the reagan administration to finish its last year in office 
meeting its inflation target of 43 percent for 1988 
its amazing said david wyss chief economist for data 
resources inc a lexington mass consulting firm weve gone 
six years into an expansion and have the lowest unemployment in 14 
years and theres no sign of inflation at least at the consumer 
level 
robert g dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said inflation grew by about onehalf percentage point in 
late 1987 but has hung there ever since 
its rather remarkable when you consider that capacity 
utilization in factories is up and the labor market has gotten 
tighter he said but there it is inflation is stalled out 
meanwhile tuesday the commerce department reported that the 
nonfarm economy grew at an annual rate of only 3 percent in the 
third quarter compared with what was generally acknowledged as an 
overheated rate of 39 percent last spring 
the effects of the drought however limited overall gnp growth 
to 25 percent in line with the federal reserve boards 
noninflationary growth target of 2 percent to 25 percent 
preliminary reports had put the annual nonfarm growth rate at 
32 percent and total gnp growth at 26 percent in the third 
quarter economists said the downward revisions were due primarily 
to larger declines in government spending and the drought having 
less overall impact than previously believed 
corporate profits before taxes rose 26 percent in the 
julyseptember quarter to 3139 billion following 69 percent jump 
in the second quarter after taxes corporations reported their 
profits rising 39 percent in the third quarter compared with 89 
percent last spring 
with productivity growth slowing the big profit increases in 
the economy are over said larry chimerine president of the wefa 
group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm higher unit labor 
costs are squeezing profit margins 
but those higher labor costs are not finding their way into 
workers wallets average weekly earnings of 32792 last month 
after adjusting for novembers inflation dropped 08 percent the 
labor department said tuesday 
in terms of buying power workers are making 1 percent less than 
they did a year ago the department said 
the november increases raised the consumer price index to 1203 
meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing 100 in a 198284 base 
period would have cost 12030 last month a dime more than in 
october and 440 more than in november 1987 
housing and shelter costs including residential rents rose 03 
percent in november the same pace they have maintained over the 
past nine months 
natural gas and electric rates were up 18 percent and 01 
percent respectively from october more than offsetting a 2 
percent drop in prices for home heating oil the government said 
the november decrease was the sixth in a row for heating oil now 
priced 108 percent below where it was last spring 
seasonally adjusted gasoline prices were unchanged from october 
remaining 02 percent less than they were at the end of last year 
and 281 percent below their peak level of march 1981 
consumer prices for items other than food shelter and energy 
rose an average 02 percent in november after jumping 07 percent in 
october 
newcar prices which has risen more than one percentage point in 
spetember and october declined by 02 percent last month in reflect 
the introduction of rebates on some of the new 1989 models 
however auto financing and insurance costs continued to advance 
dramatically with the former up 15 percent and the latter 09 
percent above october airline fares also jumped by 11 percent 
medical costs meanwhile rose 04 percent last month and are up 
at an annual rate of 7 percent so far this year
