life imprisonment without possibility of parole for ramirez 29 of 
el paso tex 
the jurors who have spent over a year on the night stalker

punishment for his crimes 
but a defense attorney asked for life saying that even if 
ramirez was possessed by the devil as some claim he deserves 
mercy 
richard ramirez has no claim to your kindness attorney 
ray clark clark said in his closing argument wednesday but if 
you give him kindness then thats what mercy is 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney p philip halpin urged 
that jurors recommend death in the gas chamber for ramirez a man 
he described as a miserable human being who killed for self 
gratification 
the jurys decision is a recommendation superior court judge 
michael tynan has the final say on sentencing he has the option of 
reducing a death penalty recommendation to life but cannot 
increase a life without parole verdict to death 
the serial murderer still faces trial in san francisco for a 
night stalker murder and in santa ana for the attempted murder 
of a mission viejo couple

ernest hemingway imitators for years have parodied 
the master in writing contests but 60 years after the publication 
of a farewell to arms its clear hemingway was his own best 
imitator 
hemingway went through 44 different often sappy or verbose 
endings of his second novel before he settled on a last line 
the discarded endings are included in an exhibit that opened 
wednesday at the john f kennedy library which has the worlds 
largest collection of hemingway manuscripts the exhibit focuses on 
the book in celebration of its 60th anniversary wednesday 
the endings written over six months read like a series of 
entries in the annual international imitation hemingway contest 
a farewell to arms is the story of a wounded soldier who 
falls in love with a nurse named catherine hemingway served in 
the italian army on the austrian front in the novel the two 
become lovers but do not marry catherine dies in childbirth at the 
end of the story 
the last paragraph of the novel comes just after catherines 
death in the hospital the nurses are shut out of the room and the 
soldier is left with his dead lover 
but after i had gotten them out and shut the door and turned 
off the light it wasnt any good the paragraph reads it was 
like saying goodbye to a statue after a while i went out and left 
the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain 
as bleak as that was many of the other endings hemingway 
scrawled on different pages paint an even darker picture 
that is all there is to the story read one discarded 
ending catherine died and you will die and i will die and that 
is all i can promise you 
another ending tried by hemingway was you can stop your life 
the way you stop a story but you do not do it and afterwards you 
are not sorry it stops for awhile by itself and then it goes 
again 
at times hemingway wallowed in bitterness 
see naples and die is a fine idea you will live to hate its 
guts if you live there perhaps there is no luck in a peninsula 
sometimes he was bitter and sappy 
that is all there is to this story there is supposed to be 
something which controls all these things and not one sparrow is 
forgotten before god it was probably 
some of the endings veer toward the verbose like this one 
after people die you have to bury them but you do not have to 
write about it you do not have to write about an undertaker nor 
the business of burial in a foreign country nor do you have to 
write about that day and the next night nor the day after nor the 
night after nor all the days after and all the nights after while 
numbness turns to snow and snow blunts with use in writing you 
have a certain choice that you do not have in life

the towheaded fourthgrader hugged a 
stuffed animal and earnestly assured the officer hed see to it his 
friend got up in time for his appointment at the parole office 
then he frowned 
i have to go see the police in the morning he said i got 
in trouble at school 
trouble was a loaded 25caliber gun the 10yearold took to 
school that day he first told police he needed the gun to fend off 
pressure from drug dealers trying to sign him up on wednesday the 
boy told officers another story saying he took the gun to show off 
to friends 
his friend was a 19 or 20yearold man maybe his brother 
being sought on a burglary charge said gary sherzan a parole 
officer 
but in the walkup flat on sixth avenue amid scattered wine 
bottles and beer cans the war on drugs was slowly surrendering 
another prisoner in the nations heartland crack cocaine won 
another round 
the cocaine gets ahold of them we can get a percentage of 
them back but its a powerful drug said kent elithorpe 
a block away on a chilly tuesday evening the night sky is 
illuminated by the steady flashing of red and blue as police round 
up that nights batch of drug dealers and users prostitutes stroll 
by pausing to watch people draped across police cars 
at the polk county jail an officer grimaces at the question but 
says theyve got 199 guests for the night capacity is 180 
its only eight oclock elithorpe said 
while cities such as new york los angeles boston and new 
orleans wage war on drugs elithorpe keeps tabs on people on the 
edge in a place where it isnt supposed to happen 
but the number of arrests of adults for allegedly selling 
cocaine has increased 80 percent over last decade and in the first 
nine months of this year the number of people in treatment for 
cocaine addiction increased four times over the same period last 
year 
a parole officer elithorpes nights are spent poking and 
probing providing a lifeline for those already afoul of the 
system increasingly crack is a part of his life and the lives of 
people like frank 
with a wife and a 5weekold baby frank lives on a treelined 
street on the citys south side in sight of des moines sparkling 
skyline hes got a record of nickelanddime crimes but on this 
night hes also got an arrest warrant with his name on it 
if hed stay off the cocaine that would probably help said 
elithorpe hes done more time on a dime than anybody ive ever 
met hes done eight years and you have to work at that 
a dime is a 10year term tuesday night frank had been 
alerted and is nowhere to be found his thirdfloor apartment is 
dark 
well be patient says elithorpe tomorrow next week next 
month frank will turn up 
dressed in jeans and sweatshirts elithorpe and his partner for 
the night sherzan try to keep on an increasingly hectic schedule 
that schedule means gangs as well as drugs 
it looks like were entering vice lord land south of here is 
the crips said elithorpe they stake it out and let it be 
known it isnt healthy to compete 
theyre looking for jim whos done time for selling drugs and 
runs many of the prostitutes up and down the street pulling up 
next to a patrol car they hail a uniformed officer 
have you seen jim asks elithorpe 
jim i just sent him up the officer replies 
hes back 
did i waste my time or what groans the officer 
iowas image is usually idyllic like that portrayed in the 
movie field of dreams 
with a rebounding state economy and jobs to be found there are 
few of the pressures that plague other cities there is however 
crack 
its a field of dreams for a few said sherzan yes its 
getting worse why its crack cocaine youre looking at a county 
with a 3 percent unemployment rate its not jobs 
on the streets some residents fight back others hunker down 
people are getting sick of it said sherzan on a good 
summer night youll see 50 or 100 people up and down this street 
taking part in a neighborhood patrol 
but a few blocks away outside a tavern crowds gather and crack 
is traded openly its a freefire zone elithorpe said 
on the citys near north side sits homes of oakridge a public 
housing project that drug czar william bennett will tour next 
month the brightly colored brick buildings dont have the 
bombedout look of projects in other cities but they house many of 
the same problems 
cesar lives there or he did his drug of choice is alcohol and 
theres a warrant with his name also he had the bad luck to be 
home when elithorpe knocked and he wont be around for bennetts 
visit 
his mother watches quietly her head hung the scene isnt new 
in this tiny apartment 
as the shift ends elithorpe brightens

a powerful bomb blew up in a car after 
it pulled into a suburban bogota gas station wednesday night 
killing two people in the cr who police theorized were terrorists 
and injuring two bystanders 
the explosion of what police said was a 110pound dynamite bomb 
leveled the filling station and damaged at least 12 vehicles it 
was the 42nd bomb blast in bogota since drug traffickers declared 
war on the government last month 
the force of the blast blew out windows in homes within 1600 
feet of the gas station in the northwestern suburb of suba 
the government began its crackdown on the cocaine cartels aug 
19 after traffickers assassinated leading presidential candidate 
sen luis galan an outspoken foe of the drug lords 
the traffickers have responded with nearly daily bombings there 
have been 113 attacks since then with dynamite or incendiary 
devices causing 10 deaths 139 injuries and damage estimated at 5 
million 
president virgilio barco headed for washington wednesday to talk 
with president bush about colombias war on drugs after announcing 
his government had reached a peace accord with a leading rebel 
group 
barco swore there would be no peace for the nations cocaine 
cartels however he is to address the united nations on friday and 
said he would ask more countries to help colombia in its drug 
battle 
as barco began his trip britain announced it will give 
substantial antiterrorist aid training communications and 
other help to colombia in its drug war british foreign secretary 
john major made the announcement to the un general assembly in 
new york he did not mention a dollar amount 
before leaving for washington barco told colombians that 
democracy was at stake in the fight 
this criminal organization wants to destroy the most precious 
thing colombians have their democracy he said in a surprise 
nationwide speech on radio and television late tuesday 
the peace treaty with the april 19 movement known as m19 is a 
major achievement for barco congressional approval still is needed 
for major aspects of the accord however 
he said the accord was signed tuesday afternoon at a guerrilla 
base camp in santo domingo a village in the andes mountains 
the treaty calls for m19s estimated 2000 guerrillas to turn 
in their weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form a 
political party 
the treaty also calls for a national referendum on 53 proposals 
including agrarian reform to give land to peasants and programs to 
provide more housing for the poor 
congress must approve a change in the constitution to allow such 
a referendum and any pardons barco said he will present the 
proposed treaty to the lawmakers next week 
tuesdays agreement is to be followed by another signing when 
there is an amnesty and weapons have been surrendered 
no deadline was set for the guerrillas to turn in their weapons 
but it appeared the date would coincide with any congressional 
action on pardons 
the peace treaty would end nearly eight years of negotiations 
started by former president belisario betancur 
the barco government is trying to start peace talks with five 
other guerrilla groups altogether about 10000 rebels are 
fighting the government 
colombias politicians and lawmakers are divided over whether 
the government should pursue peace with the drug traffickers 
barco has steadfastly refused to consider negotiating with the 
drug lords 
the drug terrorists do not respect the sacred right to life 
they have threatened the press and they have trampled laws he 
said tuesday night 
since the crackdown began authorities have seized 1056 pieces 
of property believed to belong to the drug lords including 
mansions ranches and businesses and 525 vehicles 74 boats and 
375 airplanes barco said 
he said 10800 people have been arrested and 535 charged with 
crimes linking them to drug traffickers 
barco said however that colombia cannot win the war without 
major help from other countries 
bush has approved 65 million in military equipment for 
colombias war on drugs 
in washington on wednesday the senate approved a 94 billion 
plan to pay for the united states own war on drugs through 
education prevention and treatment law enforcement and a host of 
other programs the house must similarly approve the measure

police arrested 25 disabled protesters outside a 
bus station late wednesday after about 200 demonstrators blocked 
entrances forcing buses to unload passengers on a busy downtown 
streets 
police loaded the protesters in wheelchairs into buses equipped 
with wheelchair lifts devices the demonstrators were demanding be 
provided on greyhoundtrailways buses those arrested were charged 
with disorderly conduct or criminal trespassing and released 
wednesdays demonstration marked the third day of protests in 
atlanta by american disabled for accessible public transportation 
members of the group occupied a federal building monday and tuesday 
in an unsuccessful bid to force the federal government to order 
wheelchair lifts installed on public buses 
that protest ended tuesday when bush administration officials 
promised to urge transportation secretary samuel skinner to meet 
with the protesters 
on wednesday police began arresting demonstrators after more 
than 18 buses were forced to park on side streets to unload 
passengers because protesters were blocking the bus terminal 
first taken into custody were protesters sitting on buses 
parked in front of them or sitting inside luggage compartments 
barricades were placed on either side of the station to block 
off passersby as protesters locked their wheelchairs together and 
chanted access is a civil right 
protest leader michael auberger said the group was demonstrating 
against a greyhoundtrailways policy requiring passengers in 
wheelchairs to bring someone with them to carry them on and off 
greyhound buses 
tom street regional manager of greyhoundtrailways had asked 
police to arrest the protesters one of whom chained himself by 
the neck to the steering wheel of the nashville tennbound bus 
this is to symbolize how the private industry tries to 
discriminate against us said clayton jones 41 of houston 
they feel if they give you a place to live you should live inside 
the four walls and not have any other life 
auberger said the group targeted the bus line for wednesdays 
demonstration because greyhoundtrailways has refused to add 
wheelchair lifts to its buses because of the costs 
were making improvements to handle the handicapped we cant 
handle it in tis manner said street refusing further comment 
greyhounds helping hands policy requires a passenger in a 
wheelchair to be carried on and off the buses but allows a 
companion to travel with the disabled passenger free of charge the 
policy also prohibits batterypowered wheelchairs inside the bus

the house edging toward a decision on cutting 
capitalgains taxes on wednesday stripped from a big 
deficitreduction bill a provision requiring that workers share in 
the power over companyfinanced pension plans 
the provision said rep marge roukema rnj would 
jeopardize the pension levels of millions of employees and 
retirees and encourage companies to drop pension protection for 
workers 
this is where america should be going in cooperation between 
employers and employees said rep george miller dcalif this 
is about fairness its about equity and control of your own 
destiny as an american worker 
the provision which would have required that half the trustees 
controlling singleemployer pension plans be workers was removed 
from the budget bill on a 250173 vote republicans voted almost 
solidly against it 
by a 39036 margin the house voved to repeal a 1986 provision 
fought vigorously by business that prohibits employers from 
claiming tax deductions for health plans that discriminate against 
lowerpaid workers 
rep byron dorgan dnd chief sponsor of repealing the 
provision known as section 89 said the tests required to prove 
nondiscrimination are an expensive maze of complexity a good 
idea that simply cannot be put into practice 
the only question america has is why did it take so long 
to repeal said rep silvio conte rmass where is the 
documentation that a problem existed requiring the rules there 
is none 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the ways and means 
committee proposed wiping out most of the nondiscrimination 
complexity but still requiring employers to prove that 
taxsubsidized health plans are not provided solely for executives 
full repeal will do nothing but result in discrimination pure 
and simple rostenkowski said 
meanwhile a vote was scheduled for next week on a new proposal 
from two key subcommittee chairmen to repeal much of the 
catastrophic care provisions added to medicare last year and to 
repeal the unpopular income surtax for the elderly that finances 
the program 
reps fortney h stark dcalif chairman of the ways and means 
subcommittee dealing with health care and henry waxman dcalif 
chairman of a health subcommittee of the energy and commerce 
committee would leave intact provisions paying for prescription 
drugs 
next weeks vote would be on whether to advance the starkwaxman 
proposals instead of the section of the overall bill reported by 
the ways and means committee that would cut the surtax in half 
wednesdays votes came as president bush continued seeking 
support for his proposal to cut taxes on capital gains and 
democratic leaders sought to defeat it with a substitute plan to 
liberalize taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
members on both sides of the capitalgains question guessed that 
backers of the reduction held a slight advantage on the eve of 
thursdays scheduled vote 
speaker thomas s foley dwash who has led opposition to the 
reduction refused to concede nobody has the votes he said 
it will be close we will keep working and we are very 
encouraged by the response 
at the white house bush restated his support for the cut and 
accused democrats of distorting the issue by calling it a tax 
reduction for the rich they are wrong he told reporters 
bush emphasized that the democratic alternative for expanded 
iras would be financed by a tax increase which would affect the 
nations 600000 wealthiest people a vote for iras he said will 
be a vote for higher taxes 
in the senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen 
dtexas introduced with support of 34 other democrats his plan for 
expanding iras but without the tax increase 
the capitalgains cut is part of a 2000page bill designed 
principally to reduce the deficit by 166 billion in the budget 
year that begins oct 1 
the defeated plan to give employees a vote in how their pension 
funds are invested was one of scores of provisions in the bill that 
are unrelated to deficit reduction 
another laborbacked provision remains in the bill it would 
prohibit employers from recovering pension assets when a plan is 
terminated the labor committee said that would discourage 
employers from killing a plan in order to use the money for other 
purposes 
rep peter visclosky dind wrote the provision giving workers 
equal representation on boards of trustees that administer 
employerfinanced pension plans it would have applied to an 
estimated 15 million singleemployer plans including those known 
as section 401k plans plans covering more than one company have 
had worker trustees for 40 years 
viscosky said he was motivated by a government report estimating 
that 40 percent of corporate takeovers result in the termination of 
one or more worker pension funds 
it is unworkable untenable and unbelievable mrs roukema 
contended she noted the labor department opposes the provision and 
said there is no need for such a change because federal law already 
requires that pension trustees act solely in the interest of 
beneficiaries

finlandization used to be a dirty 
word in finland attitudes are changing but finns still squirm 
over their history of deference to the soviet union 
the term used to describe a nations subservience to a greater 
power but as the soviets open to the west eastern europeans now 
look to finland as a model for free cooperation with the superpower 
finlandization is losing its slavish connotations 
a reminder of how deeply the soviets were involved in finnish 
affairs is being published in the memoirs of ahti karjalainen a 
former prime minister alleging soviet interference in the 1982 
presidential election 
the book the minister of the president hit the stands this 
month setting off an unusual furor in this nation of consensus 
politics 
karjalainen disclosed the existence of a letter from 
thenforeign minister paavo vayrynen his colleague in the center 
party about a 1981 meeting with soviet embassy official viktor 
vladimirov to discuss moscows help for karjalainens presidential 
bid 
vladimirov reportedly told vayrynen that the kremlin could 
influence finnish communists and other prosoviet factions to 
support karjalainen against the social democratic candidate mauno 
koivisto moscow also could manipulate its trade with finland to 
make karjalainen a senior trade official look good 
vayrynen now the opposition leader claimed the letter was 
misinterpreted and threatened legal action but he admitted that 
such talks with the soviets were routine 
those discussions were similar to the discussions that most 
finnish politicians at that time had with soviet representatives 
he said on finnish television fortunately habits have changed 
from eight years ago 
the actual extent of soviet involvement was not disclosed and 
koivisto won the election it was not clear why karjalainen who is 
now retired published a story so damaging to his own party 
the episode recalled days when no major policy was adopted 
without consulting the soviets or at least considering how they 
would respond 
in domestic affairs finnish politicians often would play the 
moscow card getting a soviet nod for a particular position to 
gain leverage over their opponents 
ten years ago almost every member of the finnish parliament 
had what we jokingly call a home russian in the soviet embassy 
said jorn donner an author filmmaker and rightwing member of 
parliament 
the russians have been used in one way or another by different 
parties its not visible any more as it was then 
erkki kauppila who retired last year as editor of the communist 
party newspaper kansan uutiset said the soviets used to say 
openly what they would accept or not accept later they discovered 
that was not the best policy after that things were done in 
political corridors 
finland shares a 793mile border with the soviet union during 
world war ii a subdued finland ceded the karelia isthmus and 
relocated 400000 finns under soviet duress the two countries 
signed a friendship and cooperation treaty in 1948 that is still 
valid 
urho kekkonen finlands dominant postwar president who retired 
in 1981 fashioned a neutral foreign policy designed to reassure 
the soviets that finland would never become a military threat thus 
buying continued finnish sovereignty 
the term finlandization first appeared in the 1960s in west 
germany to refer to a country intimidated by the soviet union to 
adopt acquiescent policies 
eastern europeans today use the term to mean a promise of 
political sovereignty and economic freedom alongside respectful 
neighborliness with the soviet union 
finlandization isnt a problem any more not like it used to 
be donner said adding however that finnish politicians remain 
very cautious 
prime minister harri holkeri on a visit to washington in may 
1988 lost his temper when asked by reporters about the aspirations 
in eastern europe for finlandization 
i hate that word finlandization from the depths of my heart i 
would like that word to be abolished he said 
but a senior foreign ministry official said recently the word 
doesnt bother us any more though the comparisons with eastern 
europe or the baltic states miss the point 
unlike eastern europe he said finland is a capitalist nation 
free of military alliances 
finland is not a model for anyone else said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
finland continues to be neutral but wealth drawn from a 
fastgrowing industrial economy and new attitudes in moscow under 
president mikhail s gorbachev have given the finns selfconfidence 
they never had before 
one indication came two years ago with the formation of a 
government led by holkeris conservative party which had been kept 
out of any meaningful cabinet position since the war because of of 
their antisoviet image 
a new generation has taken over in finland and the 
atmosphere among the russians also has relaxed donner said 
there are still some traces of influence like a shadow

mikhail s gorbachev will visit japan in 1991 
becoming the first soviet leader ever to visit this country a 
foreign ministry official said today 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze informed his japanese 
counterpart taro nakayama of gorbachevs intention in a meeting at 
the soviet mission to the united nations in new york on wednesday 
shevardnadze also told nakayama that he hopes to visit tokyo in 
midmarch and invited nakayama to visit moscow afterwards the 
official said 
to date four japanese prime ministers have visited moscow but 
no soviet leaders has ever visited tokyo 
japan has repeatedly requested the soviet union to send its top 
leader to japan to improve relations 
the tokyo government hopes a visit by a soviet leader would help 
resolve the territorial dispute over the northern territories 
a group of small islands off northern japan claimed by japan but 
occupied by the soviet union 
the two countries began longstalled talks on a peace treaty 
earlier this year but the territorial issue remains the largest 
stumbling block

a ceasefire in lebanon has sent 
thousands of refugees streaming back home but tony raphael and 
many others are turning their backs on their ravaged homeland and 
planning new lives elsewhere 
i dont believe in it the 26year old maronite catholic 
said as he waited for a canadian visa in cyprus its always like 
this one ceasefire after another its been going on for 14 
years i dont want another 14 years 
tens of thousands of lebanese most of them christians have 
made the hazardous 100mile trip to cyprus since fighting broke out 
in march between syrian and christian forces in lebanon some came 
seeking visas to other countries others to sit out the fighting 
about 1 million refugees have returned to beirut since a 
ceasefire sept 22 raphaels parents are among those who plan to 
go back home 
i told them you want to go back youre crazy said 
raphael who lived in beirut i swore last time i got off the 
boat im not going back 
cyprus government spokesman akis fantis said wednesday there 
were 11000 lebanese in cyprus which often has been a sanctuary 
during periods of intense fighting in lebanon 
but relief officials said the number just before the ceasefire 
was at least 30000 
in the latest exodus most of the christian refugees made the 
risky threehour journey on a 330seat hydrofoil the santa maria 
from jounieh north of beirut to larnaca on the southern cyprus 
coast 
for much of the last six months the hydrofoil often shelled by 
the syrians was the christians only link to the outside world 
from their enclave north of beirut 
ghada nasser 26 was one who fled on the santa maria the last 
straw for her was the fear that an artillery barrage would mar her 
wedding reception as happened during a friends wedding 
shells started falling when they were having the reception 
boom boom she said that was it and the bride was crying 
mrs nasser came to cyprus was married in nicosia in a civil 
ceremony and prepared to start a new life with her jordanian 
husband in kuwait 
bassel abou jaoudeh 19 ran an electronics repair shop part 
time while studying at a college in christian east beirut the

my house was destroyed my shop was destroyed the college 
closed and there was no way to continue my studies said jaoudeh 
a maronite who has just received a canadian visa after a fourmonth 
wait 
on the eve of his departure for canada and a new life he spoke 
in the dining room of a 15thcentury monastery nestled in the heart 
of the bustling southeastern tourist resort of ayia napa 
the monastery run by the middle east council of churches as a 
conference center has become a haven for lebanese who arrive in 
cyprus penniless or have difficulty finding shelter 
the rev riad jarjour who runs the center helps dozens of 
lebanese who turn up on his doorstep seeking assistance with money 
lodging or food 
the exodus from lebanon to cyprus over the last six months was 
unlike any time before said jarjour hotels and furnished 
apartments were crammed with refugees 
jarjour stressed that his center does not encourage people to 
emigrate we want them to stay to live in unity in their own 
country 
but many lebanese are not convinced 
every weekday dozens line up at the us embassy in nicosia 
staying up all night for visa interviews the next morning 
an embassy spokesman said consular officers interview 30 to 40 
applicants a day only a few dozen are allowed to wait in line 
security guards turn away as many as 100 others asking them to 
come back the next day 
canada had to open an immigration office in nicosia to cope with 
the flood of applicants the emigration process for the united 
states canada and other countries takes months but for the 
warweary lebanese its worth the wait 
anythings better than sitting in lebanon even if its just 
sitting here and not doing anything here there are no shells 
falling on you said 24yearold zena touma

the range said jon long a base spokesman

meters beyond the target area he said the base which has 21000

a prosecutor urged a jury wednesday to 
recommend death in the gas chamber for convicted night stalker 
richard ramirez saying he killed for simple gratification 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin delivering his final 
argument after the defense decided not to present witnesses 
described in detail the gruesome murders committed by ramirez in 
1985 
the same jury decided sept 20 that the 29yearold drifter was 
the devil worshiping night stalker who committed 13 gruesome 
murders and 30 felonies including numerous sex crimes in which he 
forced his victims to swear to satan 
the jurors were to begin their deliberations on the penalty 
thursday morning 
it is very difficult for us as human beings to face this 
type of evil without trying to deny it without trying to 
rationalize it without trying to explain it away halpin said 
if anyone has ever earned the death penalty richard ramirez 
has he said 
halpin acknowledged that the motive for ramirezs killing spree 
has never been explained and he can only surmise the shootings 
throat slashings eye gougings and other atrocities were for the 
simple gratification of this miserable human being 
ramirez showed no reaction to the prosecutors remarks and 
continued chatting with his defense team as halpin spoke 
defense lawyer ray clark the last to address the jury stressed 
that life in prison without possibility of parole the only 
alternative to a death sentence under california law is hell 
and sufficient punishment for ramirez 
mr ramirez will die in prison theres no question about 
it said clark the only question youre going to answer is 
whether he dies according to the schedule of the state of 
california or according to gods schedule 
referring to evidence that ramirez was a devil worshiper clark 
suggested that even the devil deserves mercy 
i think its inescapable that something was wrong with 
ramirez and we dont know what it was said clark lets say 
we believe he was possessed if there is such a thing then the 
extension of mercy goes to the devil because he is considerably 
more in need of mercy than anybody else 
ramirez decision not to present witnesses during the 
lifeordeath penalty phase of his trial startled superior court 
judge michael tynan who quizzed him on it 
mr ramirez is it true you do not wish to take the stand 
the judge asked 
yes the shaggyhaired ramirez replied in a husky voice 
and you agree with the tactical decision that you not put on 
evidence at this stage of the proceedings tynan asked 
yes ramirez said 
lawyer daniel hernandez said he had 100 witnesses lined up to 
testify about ramirez value as a human being and his early 
life in el paso texas but decided at the last minute to abide by 
his clients wishes 
we felt and he felt he didnt particularly want to lay his 
life out for the public and the court to scrutinize said 
hernandez i wanted to give him the last grain of dignity human 
dignity and spare him that 
asked whether he could explain what drove ramirez to commit the 
grisly string of crimes hernandez said thats confidential i 
cant discuss it

the threat of toxic fumes from a fire raging 
out of control at a chemical plant wednesday night forced the 
evacuation of more than 600 homes and shut down amtraks northeast 
corridor 
a fire dispatcher said the first alarm in north philadelphia was 
reported at 823 pm by midnight the fire was under control no 
injuries were reported 
were very worried about it because of the volatility of the 
chemicals fire commissioner roger ulshafer said 
he said the chemicals included benzene styrene hydrochloric 
acid benzylperoxide sulfuric acid caustic soda bromine 
propylene dichloride and divinyl benzine 
they are very flammable explosive and also several of those 
are very toxic the commissioner said 
witnesses said the 500foot building was almost completely 
engulfed in flames minutes after the fire broke out and it 
appeared to be destroyed as the fire raged some of the 200 
firefighters on the scene said they were worried about the walls 
collapsing 
the evacuees were taken to three nearby churches 
were fortunate that most of the products of combustion went 
straight up into the air however every once in a while theres a 
wind change and they blow to the south thats the reason for the 
evacuation ulshafer said 
four amtrak tracks on the northeast corridor near the factory 
were shut down from 845 pm until 1005 pm when two tracks 
were reopened according to railroad spokesman john jacobsen 
we had six northbound trains and three southbound trains 
holding in different parts of philadelphia jacobsen said soon 
after partial service was restored two tracks is all we need 
and we should be back to normal 
local trains that also use the amtrak line were stopped the 
southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority arranged for 
shuttle bus service for two inbound trains and delayed several 
outbound ones 
the burning building was owned by the purolite chemical co a 
waterpurification business but employees said the second floor 
was rented to sterling hobbies a company that makes balsa model 
airplanes 
the purolite employees said they smelled an odor like gasoline 
and looked up to see flames

this matter to deflect from the importance of the campaign said 
charles perkins a giuliani spokesman 
mason told reporters he meant nothing by the remark published 
wednesday in the village voice 
i care more for the black people than any other person in the 
country mason said i hate bigots 
dinkins said he was not particularly offended by the remark 
i can say that that kind of comment is not helpful to our city 
he said 
giuliani was troubled by masons comment perkins said 
the voice a weekly newspaper in new york also quoted mason as 
saying there is a sick jewish problem of voting for a black man 
no matter how unfit he is for the job jews are sick with 
complexes 
mason later called that comment stupid but not before mayor 
edward i koch and several jewish groups denounced the remark as 
offensive dinkins defeated koch in the democratic primary

against the voice on thursday for a vicious attack on the

jonathan larsen editorinchief of the voice said the paper 
would reserve comment until we actually see the suit but we 
stand behind the story he denied masons comments were taken out 
of context and made off the record

the inventor of an abortion pill widely used in 
france but not allowed in this country has won americas most 
prestigious medical research award outraging antiabortion 
activists 
dr etienneemile baulieu of france provoked an international 
ethical debate with his discovery of ru 486 which prevents a 
fertilized egg from developing into a pregnancy 
in addition to baulieu five other scientists won albert lasker 
medical research awards on wednesday 
the awards are a kind of american nobel prize for medical 
research dr james o mason assistant secretary of the health and 
human services department described them as the most prestigious 
and coveted in american science 
they often foreshadow the choices of the nobel judges fortysix 
lasker winners went on to win nobel prizes often within a few 
years of receiving the us award 
the other winners wednesday were lewis thomas the writer and 
doctor and four scientists who study the chemicals that allow 
cells to respond to hormones growth factors and neurotransmitters 
the four are michael j berridge of the university of 
cambridge england alfred g gilman of the university of texas 
southwestern medical center in dallas edwin g krebs of the howard 
hughes medical institute and the university of washington school of 
medicine in seattle and yasutomi nishizuka of the kobe university 
school of medicine in japan 
thomas scholarinresidence at cornell university medical 
college in new york and president emeritus of memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york received the albert 
lasker public service award for his writings on medicine 
thomas writings have heightened and transformed the publics 
perception of biomedical science the committee said 
antiabortion activists condemned the award to baulieu while 
womens rights advocates praised the action 
his achievement is to kill people said dr john willke 
president of the national right to life committee in washington 
its outrageous that they would give this to a man whose 
achievement is to develop chemical warfare against the unborn 
patricia ireland executive vice president of the national 
organization for women said its an encouraging sign that the 
knownothings are not going to stop the medical research community 
from honoring baulieus contribution 
dr michael e debakey chairman of the awards jury said the 
controversy surrounding ru 486 did not influence the jury 
they look at the scientific content of the work and thats 
all he said society makes the decision about what it does 
with the knowledge 
in his acceptance speech baulieu said that 200000 women around 
the world die each year of poorly done abortions and there are 
many hundreds of thousands of women wounded physically and 
psychologically 
the discovery of ru 486 gives women a choice he said choice 
is freedom science cannot and must not dictate our beliefs but 
science can provide choices he said 
the drug reportedly being used for about 15 percent of elective 
abortions in france has not been approved in the united states 
but it has provoked a storm of controversy here nonetheless 
opponents have threatened boycotts of any company that should 
choose to sell it in the united states and abortionrights 
advocates have promised to lobby for the pills sale in the united 
states 
the drugs manufacturer roussel uclaf of france withdrew it 
from the french market on oct 26 1988 because of an outcry of 
public opinion at home and abroad and a threatened boycott of its 
products sales were resumed two days later at the insistence of 
the french government 
the drug blocks pregnancy after conception by interfering with 
the hormone progesterone which is essential to the maintenance of 
pregnancy when progesterones action is blocked the uterus sheds 
its lining any egg that might have been fertilized and implanted 
in the lining is shed along with it

parliament early today indicted former 
premier andreas papandreou on bribery charges in a 210 million 
bank embezzlement scandal that helped topple his nearly decadeold 
socialist administration 
the 300member unicameral legislature voted 166 to 121 that 
papandreou and four of his senior cabinet ministers should stand 
trial before a special court in connection with the bank of crete 
scandal 
it was the first time in greeces history that a civilian 
political leader was ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing 
in office 
the governing coalition of conservatives and communists formed 
after june elections that removed papandreou from power controls 
173 seats in parliament so papandreous indictment had seemed a 
certainty when debate began 
in a rare appearance before a packed chamber before the vote 
papandreou said he is innocent of the criminal charges bribery 
accepting stolen money and breach of faith 
he said he accepts political responsibility for the scandal that 
broke in october but called the indictment politically motivated 
i have not come to respond to the transparent charges nor to 
my slanderers but to restore the truth he declared 
papandreou 70 whose panhellenic socialist movement pasok 
rose to power in 1981 on a platform of pulling greece out of nato 
and closing us military bases remains a popular hero to many 
greeks 
in fact papandreou still heads his party and is expected to run 
for office in elections to be held by nov 5 
the governing coalition that took power after the june elections 
left a hung parliament and promised to prosecute politicians 
involved in scandals before holding new elections 
todays vote by secret ballot ended a twoday debate on 
evidence presented by a parliamentary commission that recommended 
prosecution 
the indicted former ministers are agamemnon koutsogiorgas who 
was deputy premier and justice minister giorgos petsos of 
transport and communications dimitris tsovolas of finance and 
panayiotis roumeliotis of the ministry of national economy 
papandreou and the four allegedly skimmed interest from money 
deposited by statecontrolled organizations in the bank of crete 
and accepted payoffs from the banks chairman george koskotas 
koskotas is currently jailed in salem mass fighting an 
extradition request from greece he has implicated the former 
premier in the scandal 
speaking to parliament papandreou said the accusations he 
accepted bribes from koskotas and that he authorized the 
embezzlement scheme were based solely on koskotas testimony 
papandreou accused local and foreign interests of being 
behind what he called his defamation a charge that he has made 
repeatedly since october 
it was the second indictment of papandreou who last week was 
ordered to stand trial for allegedly instigating widespread illegal 
wiretapping of friends and political opponents while in office 
the special court is not expected to hear the two cases until 
midnovember meaning papandreou may run for office while under 
indictment 
four of the accused appeared in parliament to defend themselves 
during the debate while roumeliotis a deputy of the european 
parliament sent a memorandum 
all face a minimum of five years imprisonment if convicted of 
the charges 
the debate began early tuesday just hours after terrorist 
gunmen killed lawmaker pavlos bakoyannis a member of the 
conservative new democracy party led by his fatherinlaw 
constantine mitsotakis 
bakoyannis alleged killers the leftist november 17 
organization accused him in a statement of involvement in the same 
scandal under which papandreou stands accused 
tsovolas told parliament tuesday that charges against him were 
concocted because he refused to bow to pressure exerted by foreign 
and greek special interest groups 
koutsogiorgas told lawmakers that he committed no wrongdoing and 
denied taking a 2 million bribe from koskotas that allegedly was 
deposited in a swiss bank account 
koskotas fled to the united states in november after a central 
bank audit at the bank of crete uncovered the embezzlement scheme 
the 35yearold fugitive in interviews from his prison cell 
claimed papandreou blackmailed him into embezzling funds for the 
benefit of his party 
according to a constitutional amendment passed by the 196774 
military dictatorship government officials can only be tried by a 
13member special tribunal made up of supreme court judges and 
appeals court presidents 
the indictments must be made by parliament acting on the 
recommendation of deputies in the session immediately following 
the one in which the crimes were allegedly committed

an appeals court ordered 
billionaire developer donald trump to fork over an additional 
81000 a year in property taxes on his 100room palm beach mansion 
the fourth district court of appeal on wednesday overturned a 
lower court ruling that had reduced the appraised value of the 
estate from 115 million to 7 million 
trump bought the maralago estate in 1986 from the merriweather 
post foundation for 10 million he later said he sealed the deal 
with only 2812 of his own money 
but several days after the purchase when a county appraiser 
valued the home at 115 million trump claimed it was worth just 
7 million the rest of the purchase price was for untaxable 
furnishings he said 
trump said the 54000squarefoot estate which stretches from 
the intracoastal waterway to the atlantic ocean and includes a 
ninehole golf course a citrus grove and a sixcar garage was so 
huge that few could afford to buy it lowering its value 
the appeals panel upheld the palm beach county appraisal and 
said the methodology employed by trump was dubious 
its wonderful said willa fearrington an attorney for the 
county which put the annual tax bill at 208341 when the dispute 
began trump had said the annual bill should be only 126816 
this year the county reappraised the mansions value at 139 
million

and the stateowned oil company petroecuador together the 
companies produce 90 percent of the countrys daily oil output of 
300000 barrels

prevent sabotage and to protect national interests 
besides being involved in oil exploration and drilling 
operations texaco runs the 300 milelong transecuador pipeline 
which transports oil from ecuadors jungle fields to the coast 
texaco spokesman guillermo cevallos said the strike shut down 
the oil fields the pipeline shiploading facilities and company 
offices oil exports 60 percent of ecuadors export earnings 
were paralyzed he said

ecuadors need of 120000 barrels daily for the time being 
the 170 striking texaco workers want severance pay from the 
company which has agreed to turn over its operations to the state 
on oct 1 it was not immediately clear how much compensation the

1986 and the government decided in september last year to take 
over the companys operations

for university of virginia senior 
mike cloud president bushs education summit means he must be up 
and out of his room by 6 am 
but others are getting a chance to see some of their classroom 
studies acted out in real life and theyre taking the opportunity 
to talk with the nations chief government executives and leaders 
of the media 
kimberly zenarolla a freshman who hopes to get into 
broadcasting says the summit is a chance to meet people such as 
arkansas gov bill clinton and cnn reporter bernard shaw 
ive been totally into it said miss zenarolla a virginia 
beach native whose picture with shaw appeared wednesday on the 
front page of the cavalier daily the studentrun newspaper the 
whole thing has been so exciting 
after watching a television crew interview virginia gov gerald 
l baliles host governor for the summit miss zenarolla told 
baliles i want to be governor of virginia someday 
i would pursue it baliles told her id vote for you 
but cloud a philosophy and history major from wilmington del 
was not bubbling over about having to leave his room on the 
universitys west lawn before dawn 
i suppose its worth it for the security of the president but 
im not sure its worth it for all of the rhetoric he said of 
the summit 
clouds room is near the center of the university founded by 
thomas jefferson the area has been disrupted for various periods 
when bush was around 
some classes were moved to make room for visitors at the twoday 
summit prompting lisa roberge a junior from richmond to wonder 
why the event wasnt scheduled for two weeks later during fall 
break 
still she said most students here feel its a prestigious 
event to have at the university 
the student newspaper in an editorial on the summits opening 
day took note of the prevailing mixture of confusion and 
hassles with unprecedented excitement 
the universitys investment in this publicity plum should 
provide abundant returns and an enhanced reputation for many years 
to come the editorial said 
many students are taking a keen interest in the discussions 
president bush is having with the nations governors about a topic 
they are expert on education 
certainly not all problems will be solved here said brett 
marston a senior from appomattox va but at least itll bring 
education into the national spotlight 
marston a government major said the federal government should 
take a more active role in education not so much for funding but 
to improve the efficiency of public school systems 
kimberly harrison a junior majoring in economics said the idea 
of developing national standards to measure educational performance 
is a good one 
but miss harrison from near petersburg va said the money 
question is more crucial to schools 
i dont want to pay for it you dont want to pay for it 
she said but i think that increasing taxes is the only way we 
can pay for it all

nearly 60 house members are asking the bush 
administration to move towards establishing diplomatic relations 
with sovietbacked angola 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa introduced the resolution 
wednesday saying it is in the interest of the united states to 
take immediate and significant measures to normalize relations with 
the government of angola 
the resolution signed by 42 democrats and 15 republicans calls 
for the united states to establish a liaison office in luanda the 
capital for support of angolas full participation in the world 
bank and international monetary fund and for us assistance to 
help angola rebuild its warravaged economy 
meanwhile lawmakers from both chambers have invited jose 
eduardo dos santos the president of angola to visit the united 
states as soon as possible to explore with you the perspective of 
the angolan government on a range of issues 
among the 34 people signing that letter which was dated sept 
21 were sens paul simon dill chairman of the senate foreign 
relations africa subcommittee and edward m kennedy dmass 
the congressional actions come as members of congress are 
debating the future of us policy on angola an oilrich country 
in southeastern africa where civil war has raged for nearly 14 
years 
some democrats led by wolpe have charged the bush 
administration is too biased in favor of jonas savimbi the rebel 
leader who has fought the central marxist government for over a 
decade 
the united states provides as much as 50 million to savimbi in 
what experts believe is one of the largest military covert aid 
programs in the world savimbi is scheduled to come to the united 
states to lobby for more money next week 
republicans and administration officials contend however that 
dos santos sovietbacked government is to blame for the failure 
of peace efforts to end the conflict 
there is absolutely no question that the major obstacle to 
peace is the intransigence and duplicity of the communist 
dictatorship in luanda said rep dan burton rill 
he said it is unlikely the government would ever agree to 
voluntarily share governing power with savimbis forces 
if we do not keep up the pressure on them at this critical 
juncture there will be no hope for reconciliation he said 
wolpe said at a hearing wednesday that administration officials 
are hampering peace prospects by failing to deal fairly with the 
angolan government 
us policy towards angola is simply not working he said 
now is an appropriate moment to advance the public debate of us 
policy to question whether policy should be determined by rigid 
ideological commitments or whether there is a possibility for 
greater rationality and balance in us foreign policy 
another democrat rep george crockett of michigan charged that 
the state department policy plays into the hands of south 
africa south africa provides aid to savimbi 
but warren clark the assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs said washington will continue to support savimbi until a 
reconciliation between the two sides in angola is achieved 
the administration believes that lasting peace and national 
reconciliation can take place only in a scenario in which there are 
no losers only winners he said 
clark dismissed the idea of diplomatic links with angola until 
national reconciliation is achieved

a philadelphia brokerage has been fined 
50000 and suspended from the national association of securities 
dealers following accusations of manipulating the price of a 
publicly traded stock 
the nasd said wednesday the action was part of a crackdown on 
fraud and abusive sales practices in the pennystock market 
bailey martin amp appel inc was accused of violating the nasds 
antifraud provisions by artificially increasing the price of stock 
for northgate industries inc a shell corporation with no assets 
the firm neither admitted nor denied the allegations it settled 
the case by paying the fine and agreeing to the suspension 
two of the firms owners who also were suspended from the 
association denied any wrongdoing they said they had agreed to 
settle the case to prevent a long costly legal fight 
we feel theyve made an enormous mountain out of a molehill 
said donald bailey chairman of bma group ltd the holding company 
that owns bailey martin 
howard m appel a coowner of the firm said the sales involved 
only 30 clients and none had complained to the association which 
regulates overthecounter stocks 
the associations marketsurveillance committee filed a 
complaint in july stating that bailey martin had acquired 70 
percent of northgates stock at 20 cents per share shortly before 
it merged with starcom entertainment international inc a company 
with no operating history or revenues 
after the merger the brokerage increased the price of the stock 
to 3 per share an increase of 1400 percent by purchasing and 
selling shares at higher prices despite limited wholesale and 
retail demand for the stock the complaint said

the chairman of the house agriculture 
committee says he expects to see a 1990 farm bill on president 
bushs desk next spring with or without an administration 
blueprint 
rep kika de la garza dtexas said wednesday the 1990 farm 
bill will not be held up so trade negotiations can proceed in 
geneva or any other place 
de la garza reacted to recent comments by agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter who has indicated that only minor work might be 
necessary on current farm law until substantive progress is made in 
the uruguay round of talks under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade 
the current food security act of 1985 will expire at the end of 
next year and congress is just getting started on a 1990 bill 
much of the nuts and bolts of the legislation will bear directly 
or indirectly on gatt trade policies and whether the united states 
will be successful in its bid to scale back and eventually 
eliminate trade barriers and subsidies that distort agricultural 
trade 
yeutter said earlier this week in minneapolis minn that he 
expected only minor changes in the commodity portions of the 1985 
farm law and that major modification could come in 1991 after gatt 
negotiations are completed 
de la garza said it is up to congress to legislate and decide 
how long a farm law will be in effect 
the congress will decide whether or not to accept or reject 
any agreement made by the administration in geneva or any other 
place he said in a statement 
we will cooperate to the extent possible with the 
administration but it is my firm intention to continue with our 
stated goal of concluding the most extensive set of farm bill 
hearings in history by the end of this calendar year de la garza 
added 
further he said it is my intention to begin the markup of a 
farm bill early in 1990 with or without a proposal by the bush 
administration 
yeutter has said he expects the administration to send its 1990 
farm bill to congress by the end of this year 
de la garza said he wants to have a fiveyear farm bill 
completed and on the presidents desk by the end of may

a national farmers union official says 
president bushs proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate 
would attract many nonfarmers into agricultural investment 
mike dunn nfu legislative director said wednesday that his 
organizations policy is opposed to rescinding capital gains 
although there are some inequities in the current law 
dunn said the current law puts an unfair load on some farmers 
primarily those who have had to restructure loans as provided by 
the 1987 farm credit act in some cases he said high capital 
gains taxes offset any writeoff benefit that might be extended by 
lenders 
when that happens the borrower can be pushed into bankruptcy or 
liquidation to settle the debt 
the bush proposal however includes some worrisome provisions 
that could be attractive to outside investors a common practice 
before congress overhauled the tax structure three years ago dunn 
said 
we would see the capital gains proposal as an excuse for 
absentee landlords to get back into agriculture he said 
the american farm bureau federation on the other hand has 
applauded the recent house ways and means committee approval of 
reduced capital gains taxes it would help momandpop type 
farmers not just rich people said federation president dean 
kleckner 
but analyst chuck hassebrook of the center for rural affairs 
walthill neb noted the usdas own economists had reported the 
1986 tax reform act tightened up the investment loopholes and that 
tax breaks became more progressive in agriculture 
in other words he said in a telephone interview the 
higherincome farmers paid a larger proportion of the tax load as a 
result of the 1986 reform 
with a reduction in capital gains he said the impact would be 
to shift tax burdens off the highestincome farmers 
if we raise the capital gains exemption well again turn 
farmland and breeding stock into tax shelter investments 
hassebrook said 
by doing that livestock herds could increase thus boosting the 
supply of meat and milk and depressing prices that farmers are 
paid he said

those southern boll weevils who gave the 
house democratic leadership fits early in the reagan 
administration are on the rise again 
this time conservative southern legislators are swing votes in 
the confrontation between president bush and house leaders over 
conflicting tax plans 
to win approval of his plan to cut the tax rate for capital 
gains bush will need strong support from southern democrats he 
got it on the house ways and means committee when six democrats 
five of them southerners joined republicans to support bush over 
their committee chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill 
the democratic leadership offered an alternative plan that would 
revive the deduction for individual retirement accounts and pay for 
it by raising taxes on the richest 600000 couples and individuals 
few of the 1981 boll weevils remain in the house but their 
ideological heirs are prime targets of lobbying on the competing 
tax bills 
the bush proposal gives a tax break for the rich paid for by 
the middle class our proposal gives individual retirement accounts 
to the middle class paid for by the superwealthy is the way 
house majority leader richard gephardt defines the issue 
the white house portrays the leadership alternative as another 
democratic proposal to raise taxes 
many southerners are siding with the president particularly 
those whose districts include hundreds of small farmers and 
businessmen timber owners and real estate investors they reject 
the idea that a capital gains tax cut benefits only the wealthy 
timber is the number one industry in georgia and i have no 
qualms in speaking out for it said democratic rep lindsay 
thomas 
weve made our case and there are many people in congress 
who have listened and thats what the party leadership is not 
listening to he said weve got to start talking about 
assisting the middleincome people whove been defecting from our 
party 
but the new boll weevils are far from united on the issue 
rep charles stenholm dtexas a leader of the 1981 defection 
to reagan is backing the leadership bill saying that a capital 
gains cut now would increase the federal deficit 
in georgia and alabama only one of 14 house democrats indicated 
support for the leadership alternative three others were 
undecided but the rest said they were solidly behind the capital 
gains reduction 
rep ben erdreich dala said he has been a longtime 
supporter of a lower tax rate for capital gains and does not intend 
to abandon that position for a plan that includes a tax increase of 
nearly 40 billion 
theres no question that what they the leadership have 
fashioned is appealing but i just have a problem starting out with 
a tax increase at the front end of budget deliberations erdreich 
said 
the democratic leaderships plan would raise the tax rate for 
family income above 155000 and individual income above 93000 
from 28 percent to 33 percent the 33 percent rate now applies only 
to family income between 74850 and 155000 and individual income 
between 44900 and 93000 
the plan also would provide a scaleddown capital gains tax 
break by eliminating the 33 percent bracket for capital gains so 
that the tax on profits from asset sales would never climb above 28 
percent 
rep buddy darden dga said he voted against the 1986 tax 
reform law because it eliminated ira deductions but he said he 
wont support the leadership alternative because i frankly doubt 
the sincerity of this plan since it was created for the sole 
purpose of derailing the capital gains reduction 
rep roy rowland dga is particularly sensitive to charges of 
party disloyalty since he won his seat in 1982 by criticizing his 
boll weevil democratic opponent for supporting the reagan economic 
program 
i dont like to call myself a boll weevil he said i look 
at myself as a moderatetoconservative democrat who has some 
allegiance to the leadership in the house 
but my primary responsibility is to the people in my district 
and my district is the largest timberproducing district that is 
privately owned in the us he said there are a lot of people 
who are small landowners and small timber owners who are going to 
be helped by this capital gains reduction

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee expressing reservations about president bushs choice 
for a top agriculture department post says he doesnt want a 
james watt clone in the job 
sen patrick leahy dvt opened confirmation hearings 
wednesday for james cason whose tenure as an interior department 
official was strongly criticized by environmentalists by saying he 
had serious reservations about cason 
cason was nominated by bush to be assistant secretary of 
agriculture for natural resources and the environment the 
departments job overseeing national forest land and agricultural 
conservation programs 
mr cason has no professional training in forest landuse 
stewardship and neither training nor experience in soil and water 
conservation said leahy 
leahy and other committee members pressed cason for four hours 
about decisions he made during his seven years at the interior 
department 
environmentalists have charged that cason in 1986 tried to 
prevent a report from becoming public that said the spotted owls 
existence could be endangered by the harvesting of old growth 
forest in the pacific northwest 
cason told leahy he did not try to hide the report saying 
changes needed to be made and he was holding it until it was 
cleaned up 
cason 35 also said that contrary to accusations he did 
nothing to hold up a petition to prevent listing the spotted owl as 
an endangered species 
he also defended the sale of land under his jurisdiction at well 
below market costs to private interests who made large profits by 
reselling the properties sen kent conrad said that in one 
instance an 1872 law was used to sell land for 42000 to private 
interests who sold it a few weeks later for 37 million 
the sale was one of several actions cason took in the final 
three weeks of the reagan administration some of which were either 
stopped or reversed by president bushs interior secretary manuel 
lujan 
cason said he had been working on the sale for two years and 
wanted to get it finished before the next administration came in 
and that he had been following a mandate from thensecretary donald 
hodel to continue with business despite the impending change in 
administrations 
decisions by cason that were changed by lujan included an audit 
agreement with 12 major oil companies that would have caused states 
and indian tribes to lose royalty payments and a policy that would 
have allowed surface mining in national parks 
what appears here is not just doing the job said leahy 
but an overabundance of zeal 
in his opening statement leahy said we are at a time when a 
strong and heightened awareness of the environment is needed in the 
department of agriculture a spirit of cooperation among all 
interests has to prevail 
we do not need a james watt clone in this position 
the agriculture committee has scheduled an oct 3 hearing for 
environmental groups to give their views on cason

two researchers say the financial setup of the 
olympic games is a travesty that demands enormous sums from the 
american networks while giving sports coverage to other nations at 
cut rates 
those other countries can turn their savings into big subsidies 
for their athletes the authors contend in their study fools 
gold how america pays to lose in the olympics 
nbc paid 300 million for the rights to the 1988 summer olympics 
in seoul and needed 5000 commercials in 179 hours of air time to 
recover its costs robert z lawrence and jeffrey d pellegrom note 
in the study for the brookings institution 
even then the network later returned 70 million to advertisers 
because of low ratings they say in the fall issue of the brookings 
review 
abc paid 309 million bid for the us rights to the 1988 winter 
olympics in calgary and lost some 65 million when expenses 
exceeded advertising revenue 
eastern europe and the soviet union meanwhile paid only 3 
million combined to get rights to the seoul games western europe 
negotiating through a single body paid just 57 million total for 
the calgary rights 
the study says that after each competing nation receives a share 
of the tv monies from olympics organizers the soviet union and 
east germany may be getting more back than they spend on tv rights 
the east bloc nations may then lavish funds on their athletes 
the funding setup for the olympics is a travesty the 
authors say 
we pay more than our fair share for the games we have to put 
up with an excessive number of commercials to see them and our 
athletes receive little of the money we do pay they say 
the ioc divides the money between the host city judges and 
officials media centers the national olympic committees and the 
ioc itself 
the us olympic committee got 25 percent of the 609 million 
abc and nbc paid for the summer and winter games in 1988 the study 
says usocs share for the 1992 games for which cbs and nbc are 
paying 644 million will be 10 percent 
lawrence and pellegrom suggest the us government and the us 
olympic committee form a joint entity that would auction the us 
television rights that group then would negotiate for us tv 
rights with the ioc as other nations do 
presuming the auction amount is higher than what is finally paid 
to the ioc the excess money could be used to support athletes the 
authors say 
congress might have to grant the networks an antitrust exemption 
for them to bid together 
cbs on wednesday refused comment on the article and nbc 
officials did not return a call seeking reaction 
dennis swanson president of abc sports said we have no 
response on any proposals at this time 
one network official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he did not see how a governmentusoc body could make substantial 
changes also the official said we dont think it is the burden 
of the networks to finance the training of the athletes 
he denied the networks were overbidding 
when a network bids on a rights package they take a look 
at what its value is obviously networks arent going to be 
spending money that they cant justify 
lawrence and pellegrom acknowledge most foreign tv networks are 
noncommercial and public owned and cant afford huge fees but say 
there are an increasing number of commercial networks and the 
american networks no longer should have to foot the olympics bill

additional safety tests ordered on the three 
savannah river reactors that produce a gas needed for nuclear 
warheads could lead to further delays in restarting the idled 
reactors 
the order announced wednesday by energy secretary james d 
watkins marked a switch from his earlier position that the tests 
need not be completed before restarting the reactors which have 
been plagued by various mechanical problems 
in a related development watkins confirmed the department was 
considering a possible twoyear delay in underground testing at 
yucca mountain a nevada desert site being studied for use as the 
first permanent dump for nuclear waste 
the savannah river complex near aiken sc is the nations 
only source of tritium a radioactive gas used to boost the 
explosive power of nuclear warheads all three reactors have been 
shut down for more than a year for repairs 
watkins made no mention of a possible restart delay his 
spokeswoman christina sankey said later it was too early to 
tell whether a delay was likely 
watkins announced sept 7 that the first of the three savannah 
river reactors would begin lowpower testing late next summer and 
would start production by the end of 1990 he ordered ultrasonic 
testing of the reactor vessels to begin immediately but he did not 
require completion of the tests before restart 
ms sankey said watkins changed his mind about the testing after 
some of his own advisers said it should be completed in all three 
reactors before any one is restarted 
the timing of a savannah river restart is viewed by the bush 
administration as critical because of dwindling supplies of the 
gas tritium decays relatively rapidly and therefore must be 
replenished to keep nuclear weapons fully operational 
the savannah river reactors have had a history of cracks and 
leaks in the primary cooling system pipes as well as flaws in the 
backup cooling systems a leak from a crack in the vessel of 
another savannah river reactor known as c reactor was discovered 
in 1984 that led to its permanent shutdown a year later 
watkins also announced that ultrasonic testing that began 
recently on the p reactor vessel at savannah river had discovered 
a potential indication of a crack in excess of nine inches 
in the area of a welded seam he said the finding is still being 
studied and that further tests are being performed on the p reactor 
he said the significance of the problem had not yet been 
determined although ms sankey said later were quite confident 
there is no crack in the vessel 
ms sankey said there was no technical reason to condition a 
k reactor restart on completion of the ultrasonic testing but that 
watkins chose to impose the condition in order to instill greater 
public confidence in the restart program 
in ultrasonic testing sound waves are bounced off the reactor 
vessel and any abnormalities show up as breaks in the waves 
restarting the savannah river reactors and completing a 
suitability study of the yucca mountain nev waste dump site are 
two of watkins highest priorities 
in a letter to sen richard h bryan dnev on tuesday 
watkins said a senior department official had suggested a delay in 
underground testing at yucca mountain in order to more intensely 
study surfacelevel features that could disqualify the site 
watkins stressed no decisions have been made on the matter 
the underground work had been scheduled to start earlier this 
year but has been held up by nevadas refusal to grant the needed 
environmental permits

congressional liberals and conservatives are 
seeking middle ground on a measure barring federal grants for art 
considered obscene but the bans author says he wont let them 
gut his proposal without a fight 
housesenate negotiators planned today to discuss senatepassed 
legislation by sen jesse helms rnc barring federal assistance 
for obscene or indecent art it also forbids government backing 
of materials that offend people because of their race ethnic 
background religion age or handicap 
were trying to work it out now rep sidney yates dill 
a liberal opposed to the helms amendment said after the two sides 
debated the issue briefly wednesday i recognize this is a matter 
that has provided controversy for decades and for centuries 
helms said the art he opposes is the promotion of 
homosexuality and as long as i have breath in me the american 
taxpayer isnt going to be forced to subsidize this kind of 
garbage 
the provision is part of a senate measure providing 109 
billion for federal land and cultural programs for the 1990 fiscal 
year which begins sunday the houses 115 billion version 
includes no such language 
negotiators faced other issues too the senate measure contains 
new reporting requirements for lobbyists that the house bill lacks 
the senate not the house also allows large tracts of federally 
owned forest in the northwest to be felled by timber companies and 
bars environmentalists from using legal action to block some of the 
cutting 
the most intense public reaction has been to the helms 
amendment which pits worries about government censorship against 
concerns that tax dollars should not spent on offensive work 
helms not among the bargainers told a reporter the negotiators 
are going to gut his proposal he said he might force the 
senate to vote three or four times before were through on 
whether to reject a compromise and restore his original proposal 
sen james mcclure ridaho a conservative who defended helms 
provision said he has unsuccessfully sought an alternative he 
told reporters the helms measure leaves unclear what should be 
considered obscene or offensive 
but he said i still havent found language which is an 
adequate substitute 
mcclure said a study is needed of the grantmaking process used 
by the national endowment for the arts the endowment has come 
under fire for spending 45000 on two controversial exhibitions 
one including a photograph by andres serrano of a christ figure in 
a jar of urine and the other including robert mapplethorpe 
photographs depicting homosexual acts and erotic poses by children 
yates said he was considering offering guidelines similar to 
supreme court rulings permitting federal aid to art that attains 
certain artistic scholarly or other standards 
he also discussed the possibility of giving more responsibility 
to top officials of the endowment he said the endowment granted 
money for the serrano show before the artist produced his work and 
for the mapplethorpe exhibition without seeing all of the 
photographs in advance 
the senate adopted the helms amendment with almost no debate on 
a july 26 voice vote on sept 13 the house rejected 264153 an 
attempt by conservatives to accept the helms amendment 
the house voted july 12 to cut a symbolic 45000 from the 
endowments 1714 million budget to protest the controversial 
grants but lawmakers rejected conservative efforts to eliminate or 
severely slash the endowments budget

a proposal to test millions of transportation 
workers for drug and alcohol use is gaining in congress along with 
the senateapproved 94 billion compromise to finance the war 
against drugs 
the war within our borders is a more terrifying and insidious 
threat than any war on foreign shores so we must not be timid 
sen robert c byrd dwva said wednesday as the senate approved 
the drug plan 972 
were not going to whip this problem in one year three years 
or four years lets find out what works added senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan were going to save a generation if we 
can it may take a generation to do it 
the senate added the drug plan to an 119 billion bill for 
transportation programs in the fiscal year starting oct 1 and 
included some other drugrelated provisions including testing for 
transport workers 
the measure also bans smoking on all domestic airline flights 
current law bans smoking on flights of two hours or less and the 
total ban was added last week over the objections of tobaccostate 
senators 
the senate approved the transportation bill 990 and sent it to 
a housesenate conference committee to resolve differences with a 
housepassed version 
the antidrug compromise was worked out by the white house and 
senators of both parties began after democrats sought to add 22 
billion to the 79 billion plan outlined by president bush in a 
nationally televised sept 5 speech 
democrats said bushs funding for prevention and treatment was 
inadequate 
the final compromise includes the original 79 billion plus 
400 million for crimefighting programs not directly related to 
drugs 200 million for juvenile justice 800 million for 
prevention and treatment and 100 million for law enforcement the 
additional money would come from a 043 cut in federal spending 
the senate approved the transportation drug and alcohol testing 
plan sponsored by sen john c danforth dmo on a voice vote 
with no opposition 
it would cover an estimated 125000 airline and federal aviation 
administration workers 172000 railroad employees and 3 million 
motor carrier workers such as bus and truck drivers 
private industries would be required to pay for random 
preemployment tests as well as tests ordered for cause or 
following accidents the transportation department could also order 
periodic testing 
the need for this legislation is obvious danforth said 
since an amtrakconrail collision at chase md three years ago 
that killed 16 there has been an average of one train wreck 
every 10 days in which testing has subsequently disclosed drug or 
alcohol abuse he said 
a measure passed by the house in july covers only the rail 
industry and would bar the firing of employees merely because they 
tested positive the senate version would leave that decision to 
the employer 
the transportation bill includes 119 billion in new spending 
plus 159 billion from previously collected taxes it calls for 
122 billion for highway projects 73 billion for aviation 
programs and 3 billion for mass transit assistance 
another measure attached to the transportation bill on a voice 
vote would earmark 50 million of the money in the drug package for 
drug treatment and aid for pregnant women new mothers and their 
babies who have drug problems 
voting against the drug funding plan were republicans jake garn 
of utah and steve symms of idaho sen james sasser dtenn did 
not vote 
garn issued a statement saying the problem with the drug bill 
is that it essentially was the product of a bidding war between the 
administration and congress over who is going to spend the most on 
drugs 
he said the cuts it envisions would hurt key programs adding 
we are not going to solve the drug problem by just throwing money 
at it

however history judges the education 
summit one thing is certain george bush came better prepared than 
franklin roosevelt did the last time a president convened the 
nations governors 
that was in march 1933 when fdr summoned the governors to the 
white house two days after his inauguration to discuss unemployment 
benefits taxes and other issues in the midst of the depression 
roosevelt the former governor of new york tendered the 
invitation to fellow governors a month before his march 4 swearing 
in 
but the tasks of getting his grips on the reins of government 
while preparing emergency decrees to deal with a run on the 
nations banks left roosevelt with little time for the governors 
as fdr aide rexford g tugwell later wrote he was caught in 
such a tangle of events that when he was wheeled into the east room 
and faced the assembly of state executives he had no prepared 
address and was not ready to discuss the several matters mentioned 
in his invitation 
the gathering took place the same morning the new democratic 
administration had promulgated a 1 am decree closing the nations 
banks roosevelts famous bank holiday 
by roosevelts own account in his public papers there simply 
was not enough time in which to do all the things which had to be 
done 
speaking extemporaneously to the 25 governors and 
representatives of a dozen others who had answered his call 
roosevelt told of his plans to restore stability to the banking 
system and prevent the withdrawal of any further gold and 
currency 
the governors gave the distracted president a unanimous 
bipartisan show of support they adopted a resolution expressing 
their confidence in roosevelt and urging both congress and the 
american people to back his efforts to restore banking and 
economic stability 
tugwell said the summit gave roosevelt a chance to reassure 
them concerning federal aid and to show them that a firm hand was 
on the wheel they responded

chinese students are using the 
education summit to prod president bush to take a tougher line with 
the government in beijing 
organizers said chinese students from more than 70 american 
universities have endorsed a ninepage memorandum expressing 
disappointment with bushs stance since the june 4 massacre in 
tiananmen square 
the appeal spearheaded by the chinese student and scholars 
society at the university of virginia said the chinese 
democratic movement is now in a very difficult situation 
it urged bush to take a firm stand on the side of the chinese 
people and to take appropriate measures to push the chinese 
government toward democratization 
since the massive persecution in china is still going on we 
advise the united states not to eagerly seek improved elations with 
the communist regime at this time the memo says 
the students support investments in chinas private sector but 
urged the us government to do nothing that would provide 
financial and economic support for chinas repressive ruling 
clique 
bush cut off military sales withdrew us support for loans to 
china by international lending institutions and barred highlevel 
contacts after the chinese government crushed the prodemocracy 
demonstrations with tanks and troops 
quingsong zhang a spokesman for the university of virginia 
group said the memo will be sent to congress and the state 
department and will be given to the white house staff at the 
education summit 
the memo says the united states faces a crucial time of 
decision will it repeat policies of the past by adhering to the 
unpopular communist government and alienating the chinese people 
or will it sacrifice shortterm interests by standing with the 
chinese democratic movement and gaining a longterm friendship with 
the people of china 
we firmly believe that the current regime will not last long 
we hope that by the end of the 20th century a new open and 
democratic government will be established in china it said

governors meeting with president 
bush to find cures for the nations education ills are pressing the 
case for less federal red tape more accountability and a greater 
commitment to help youngsters at the earliest age 
if you want a slogan its exchange red tape for results 
arkansas gov bill clinton told reporters wednesday evening 
citing an example of federal rules that slow reform clinton 
said current regulations forbid students in evening adult classes 
from using computers bought for disabled children with federal 
dollars 
in urging bush to give the states more flexibility new mexico 
gov garrey carruthers said let us do it our own way we will 
demonstrate that were doing it better 
bush for his part responded to the call for deregulation with 
a challenge for more specifics on how states will prove they are 
getting results with less regulation 
governors met in three closeddoor sessions wednesday with bush 
and his cabinet discussing how to revitalize the teaching 
profession how to improve the learning environment and who should 
be in charge of governing schools 
clinton and other governors indicated that they hoped the summit 
sessions will produce the raw material to develop concrete national 
reform goals possibly as early as the february meeting of the 
national governors association 
clinton said the federal funding question is not the major 
issue for this summit although some governors have said they 
want the federal government to boost its share of school spending 
federal drug czar william bennett who headed the education 
department during the reagan administration said the exchanges 
between governors and administration officials were sometimes 
feisty especially when several questioned the lag in federal 
education spending compared with defense 
the discussion bennett said was marked by standard 
democratic pap republican pap with occasional outbursts of 
candor 
on early childhood programs the governors repeated their call 
for full funding of federal programs such as head start but 
neither bush nor anyone in his administration gave a clear signal 
that they were ready to adopt full funding as a goal 
it is a good program it works but it is not available except 
to about 27 percent of the eligible students complained 
colorado gov roy romer a democrat 
pennsylvania gov robert p casey a democrat said one of his 
concerns is accountability in education saying efforts to improve 
schools need objective criteria to measure their success 
another session on how to revitalize the teaching profession 
centered on among other issues how to recruit more minority 
youngsters but with a recognition that for a long time to come 
minority students will be taught mainly by white teachers said 
washington gov booth gardner cochair of that group 
a twopage memo summarizing objectives for the summit by the nga 
outlined seven possible national performance goals including 
all preschoolage children be ready for first grade by the year 
2000 
student achievement levels will rise to internationally 
competitive levelsespecially in math and science 
disparities in achievement levels of students of different 
races and economic backgrounds will be dramatically reduced 
the number of students going on to college or other higher 
education will be dramatically increased 
adult illiteracy be virtually eliminated 
schools will have welltrained teachers and the technology to 
be competitive 
the memo proposed that once goals are set and ways are found to 
achieve them we should move to a report card issued every year 
on the efforts of students schools the states and the federal 
government 
the memo suggested that governors urge bush to get each member 
of his cabinet to target federal resources to ten of the largest 
and most troubled districts and 50 to 100 poor rural districts 
to reduce racial and economic disparities in educational 
opportunities 
states for their part should agree to restructure the 
education system in each state work with the federal government 
to reduce losses in the student loan program and work toward 
drugfree schools the memo said

diuretics a class of drugs routinely recommended 
for millions of people battling high blood pressure may increase 
the risk of heart attacks according to a study published today 
researchers have found the relatively inexpensive and widely 
used weapon against hypertension can cause biochemical changes that 
make patients vulnerable to adverse side effects 
an estimated 15 million to 25 million of the nations 60 million 
high blood pressure patients use diuretics which reduce blood 
pressure by depleting the body of sodium but increasingly 
researchers are recommending doctors consider alternative 
treatments 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
indicates diuretics can act directly on body tissue to chemically 
induce diabetic conditions and can increase cholesterol levels 
this is a major study dr randall zussman director of the 
division of hypertension and vascular medicine of the massachusetts 
general hospital told the new york times it should make a 
difference 
the researchers drs thomas polare hans lithell and christian 
berne of the university of uppsala in sweden gave 50 hypertension 
patients either the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide or the 
nondiuretic captopril without revealing to patients or their 
doctors who got which drug after four months the patients 
medications were switched 
the study found that the tissue in patients who took 
hydrochlorothiazide was less responsive to the hormone insulin a 
resistance that could increase the risk of heart disease 
the patients using diuretics also showed cholesterol levels 15 
percent higher than those recorded in the subjects using captopril 
which reduces blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels 
the nondiuretic users showed signs of increased sensitivity to 
insulin and reduced cholesterol levels the study found 
diuretics are among four classes of drugs recommended by the 
national heart lung and blood institute as initial medications 
for reducing hypertension the three other classes are ace 
inhibitors like captopril beta blockers and calcium channel 
blockers

tenyearold joshua dennis paced prayed and 
never gave up hope during the five days he spent trapped by 
darkness inside an abandoned mine 
after days of frantic search efforts and growing despair that he 
would be found alive joshua was found wednesday afternoon by a 
mine search team that had passed within 150 feet of him during 
previous sweeps 
the youngster suffering from dehydration and frostbitten feet 
was flown to a hospital in salt lake city where his tearful 
mother janeen pronounced him gorgeous 
joshua a cub scout became separated friday night from a group 
of boy scouts that his father was helping to supervise during the 
expedition into the hidden treasure mine in western utahs oquirrh 
mountains 
dennis said her son had faith he would be found 
he never heard rescuers until today she said wednesday 
and he heard their voices and he yelled for help and they heard 
him 
dr tony woodward said the boy probably would lose some skin on 
his feet but would go home in three to four days with all of his 
toes 
sheriffs deputies utah power amp light co mine rescue crews 
search dogs and dozens of volunteers had scoured the mines tunnels 
and surrounding canyon areas but found no sign of the boy 
tooele county sheriff donald proctor said hopes were dwindling 
when power company rescuers ray guymon and gary christensen went 
back in the mine wednesday afternoon to recheck an ore pocket with 
local historian john skinner 
the three probed the area for about 30 minutes and then heard a 
cry for help guymon said 
christensen scrambled up a 150foot incline and found joshua in 
a cavity in the ore pocket about 500 feet from where he was last 
seen and more than 2000 feet from the mine entrance 
the boy seemed well and was shocked to learn hed been lost five 
days christensen said 
he was one brave little boy he wasnt crying he wasnt 
scared christensen said 
word of the rescue was met with tears cheers and embraces by 
family members and their neighbors in kearns who planned a block 
party to celebrate 
its amazing guymon said we did not expect to find the 
boy in the condition that hes in this was the ultimate of what we 
were hoping for 
christensen said searchers had been through the passageway just 
below the ore cavity about 10 times but the cavern muffled sound 
and joshua would not have been detected had he not cried out at 
that moment 
he was just isolated in a little hole that you couldnt see 
until you were on top of it he said 
proctor had said other scouts apparently teased joshua into 
entering the mine and then tried to scare him once he was inside 
the boy told hospital personnel he had become separated from his 
father terry and the older scouts and tried to find his way out 
by feeling the walls 
hart bullock chief executive of the great salt lake boy scout 
council said the incident would be discussed by the boy scouts of 
americas national health and safety committee in november 
hidden treasure mine a gold silver and zinc mine last worked 
in 1953 will be sealed proctor said

the names bush or bush i were found on 
several packages of cocaine seized in a raid four colombian men 
were arrested 
officials said it was unclear whether the labels found on 19 of 
the 93 packages of cocaine worth about 17 million were a derisive 
reference to president bush who is aiding the crackdown on 
colombian drug lords 
but they speculated on the possibility 
the president has brought the issue to an issue of national 
priority unlike the issue has ever been brought to that point 
before said robert stutman special agent in charge of the drug 
enforcement administration office in new york 
so if youre a businessman down there selling dope youve 
clearly got to say this guy is a pain in the neck to us 
stutman said the word bush had been found on cocaine 
packages several other times in the city this year and that 
authorities are checking to see if it had been found in drug raids 
elsewhere 
police trailed a car to the home in great neck long island 
after watching a drug pickup in the new york city borough of queens 
police seized 210 pounds of cocaine the four men were charged 
with conspiracy to distribute cocaine authorities said

senior gen vo nguyen giap 
today embraced the leaders of military units returning from 
cambodia where the prohanoi government was said to be losing 
territory to guerrillas 
before the outdoor ceremony to welcome back thousands of troops 
vietnamese generals said that their last units had left cambodia 
tuesday ending a nearly 11year struggle against resistance forces 
in the neighboring country 
vietnam says it has now withdrawn the last 26000 of its troops 
from cambodia but the cambodian guerrilla resistance claims 
thousands of vietnamese soldiers have stayed disguising themselves 
as cambodians 
rebel radio broadcasts monitored in bangkok thailand on 
wednesday said 3000 vietnamese troops were defending the gemrich 
cambodian town of pailin near the thai border from a threepronged 
attack by khmer rouge guerrillas 
gen nguyen van thai chief spokesman for the ministry of 
defense denied the claim but said guerrilla forces had taken some 
territory 
the announced vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears that 
cambodia will slide into a protracted civil war 
wars and bloody revolution have kept cambodia torn by conflict 
for the last 20 years the khmer rouge the strongest of three 
resistance groups sent hundreds of thousands of cambodians to 
their deaths in trying to turn the country into an agrarian commune 
from a nearly fouryear rule that ended with vietnams 1978 
invasion 
giap 78 told reporters after the welcoming ceremony that peace 
can be achieved in cambodia if countries supporting the resistance 
respond to vietnams pullout by ending their aid 
now that vietnamese troops have been withdrawn the ball is on 
the other side he said if they dont respond the cambodian 
people must continue their fighting 
giap a key strategist during vietnams war with the united 
statescurrently is vice chairman of the vietnamese military 
council 
he said vietnam would patiently try to achieve a political 
solution to the guerrilla war in cambodia 
we have created a favorable condition for a political 
settlement by withdrawing from cambodia now other countries must 
stop their military support for the guerrillas 
china supplies arms to the insurgents while thailand has 
allowed them to set up bases on its territory 
in the back of the troop formations during the outdoor welcoming 
ceremony soldiers chatted with giggling girls from le qui don an 
elite girls school 
its nice to talk to vietnamese girls again said a 
22yearold soldier grasping a bouquet of flowers given by the high 
school girls 
few other residents of ho chi minh city took part in the 
ceremony in front of the city hall formerly south vietnams 
presidential palace 
im happy the soldiers have come back so mothers and fathers 
wont have to worry any more and families will stop losing their 
sons a shopkeeper said 
asked if vietnamese troops might return to cambodia giap said 
it now is the duty of the international community to prevent a 
return of the khmer rouge to power 
nguyen vinh nghiep chairman of the peoples committee of ho chi 
minh city called the withdrawal of troops from cambodia a big 
event for vietnam and said people all around the world are 
paying attention 
behind him a large banner read solidarity forever between 
the peoples of vietnam and cambodia 
many western countries have withheld diplomatic recognition of 
vietnam and the phnom penh government because of vietnams invasion 
and continued military presence 
officials from both countries say they hope the withdrawal will 
encourage the establishment of political and business ties with 
other nations 
asked if vietnamese troops should have withdrawn earlier from 
the stalemated guerrilla war giap said he disagreed 
american troops after eliminating japanese fascism remained 
in japan and in germany and in south korea have they been there 
too long 
giap said he believed the troop withdrawal would lead to peace 
in cambodia 
im optimistic i think the international community loves 
peace and justice and in the end we will find a peaceful 
solution

foreign secretary john major of britain 
says london will make it easier for some hong kong residents to 
resettle in britain if their freedom is threatened by china as it 
takes control of the colony in 1997 
major also promised a more representative government for hong 
kong and an early bill of rights for the colony that sets forth 
basic liberties such as freedom of expression and travel 
these fall under a package of concrete measures to reassure 
people in the territory about their future major said wednesday 
in a speech to the un general assembly 
many hong kong residents anxious about their future under 
communist china after its repression of the prodemocracy movement 
have appealed to britain to let them emigrate 
london has ruled out largescale immigration from hong kong 
but major said it would give people considered essential to 
hong kongs future stability and prosperity guarantees of 
resettlement in britain if they wish when the colony reverts to 
chinese rule 
this was believed to cover citizens such as senior public 
servants but it was not immediately clear how the essential 
citizens would be chosen and how many would be allowed to emigrate 
major said britain would hasten the introduction of a 
democratically elected government in hong kong where the 
legislature currently is appointed the aim is for half the seats 
to be chosen in popular balloting by 1995 
he said the measures to be implemented and the resettlement 
offer were to encourage citizens to stay in hong kong and push 
china to uphold its promises under a 50year agreement to maintain 
the colonys freedoms and way of life 
practical reassurances are required from china to the people 
of hong kong so that they may feel secure in their future both up 
to 1997 and beyond major said 
hong kong is resilient and its economy is thriving but it 
will take time steady nerves and above all an explicitly 
supportive attitude on the part of china to restore hong kongs 
confidence in its future major said 
millions of us around the world were shocked to see chinese 
troops kill and wound their fellow citizens on the orders of their 
own government he said no government can survive indefinitely 
by the suppression of peaceful dissent 
major said londons response to the june military crackdown in 
china is not intended to isolate beijing 
we hope to see china return to genuine reform and repair the 
damage done to her international relations he said 
in london on wednesday chinese and british officials began 
three days of talks on the issue british officials pressed beijing 
authorities for pledges that china will respect human rights and 
preserve hong kongs position as the major asian financial center

a teenager charged with murdering his 
parents sister and brother with an ax had talked to his friends 
about killing his family as a kind of game a prosecutor said 
jurors were presented with grisly evidence at the start of the 
trial wednesday including photos of the carnage and a 
bloodspattered ax the prosecution claims was used in the killings 
olmsted county district judge ancy morse told jurors not to 
discuss any trauma the trial may cause them and said the county 
would provide counseling to anyone seeking it after the trial ends 
seventeenyearold david brom is charged with first and 
seconddegree murder in the feb 18 1988 ax slayings of his 
parents bernard and paulette brom both 41 his sister diane 13 
and brother ricky 11 
if he is found guilty a second phase of the trial will be held 
to determine if he was mentally ill at the time of the slayings and 
therefore not responsible 
brom was dressed neatly and sat with his back to a halffilled 
courtroom gallery showing no emotion 
county attorney ray schmitz told jurors that brom repeatedly 
talked to friends about killing his family as part of a kind of 
game 
the game as the teenagers referred to it also called for 
brom and his friends to flee to the west or south after the 
killings schmitz said adding that some scenarios included talk of 
the friends killing themselves 
the prosecutor said a friend of brom would testify that brom 
proposed different alternatives for killing his family and talked 
on one occasion about practicing doing something against his mother 
schmitz said brom admitted the killings in a conversation with a 
friend and he said brom told a friend he had an altercation with 
his father the night of the killings 
suddenly schmitz said it moved from the game to 
something far more serious 
broms palm print was found on a bloodstained ax found in the 
familys home the prosecutor said 
a defense attorney said he does not plan to challenge evidence 
linking the defendant with the slayings conceding that the jury 
likely will reach a guilty verdict of some type lawyer 
terrence walters said he would argue that the slayings were not 
planned and brom should be convicted of the lesser charge of 
seconddegree murder

two men who became the eighth and 
ninth persons to survive a ride over niagara falls in a barrel said 
they did it to show kids there are better things to do than drugs 
it felt like a roller coaster ride falling straight down 
jeffrey petkovich said afterward but with a roller coaster ride 
you come to a minor stop you feel it but not as much as we did 
petkovich 25 of ottawa and peter debernardi 42 of niagara 
falls ontario rode a 10foot metal container over the 
176foothigh horseshoe falls on wednesday to become the first pair 
ever to go over together in the same barrel 
three people did not survive the plunge 
we wanted to show these kids theres a lot better things for 
kids to do than be on the brink of dope debernardi said 
the two suffered very very minor cuts and scrapes during 
their ride said constable david jahns of niagara parks police 
jahns said debernardi and petkovich entered the niagara river 
about 100 yards from the brink of horseshoe falls on the canadian 
side of the border at about 530 pm they were rescued at the 
bottom by park police but the barrel was still in the water and 
was to be recovered today he said 
both men were charged with unlawfully performing a stunt in the 
park debernardi who had been saying for 18 months he would 
perform the stunt also was charged with engaging in a prohibitive 
activity in the park jahns said 
the men were released pending an oct 26 appearance in 
provincial offenses court in niagara falls jahns said 
the metal barrel lined with foam on the inside was about 10 
feet long and 4 to 5 feet high jahns said 
your chances are quite low on the 1to10 scale type of 
things no matter how hightech your equipment is he said 
the last person to make the rough journey was john david munday 
of caistor center ontario who went over on oct 5 1985 and 
survived 
a month before munday went over steven t trotter of 
barrington ri successfully took the plunge the previous year 
karel soucek of hamilton ontario also made a successful trip but 
he was killed six months later when he tried a similar barrel drop 
at the astrodome in houston 
the first daredevil to attempt the stunt was annie edson taylor 
a michigan school teacher she survived the trip in 1901 although 
she was badly injured 
those who have died going over the falls were george stathakis 
in 1930 charles g stephens in 1930 and william red hill jr 
in 1951 
only one person has ever survived the plunge outside a barrel 
nineyearold roger woodward was accidentally swept over the falls 
in 1960 although he was wearing only a life jacket he was plucked 
from the water unscratched

a royal navy warship was en route to colombia 
today as part of a british aid package requested by colombias 
government to help it battle the countrys powerful cocaine cartels 
the ship will patrol colombias coast looking for drug 
traffickers but will not have the jurisdiction to arrest or detain 
suspected drug traffickers the defense ministry said 
a ministry spokesman would not identify the ship involved but 
british news reports said the frigate hms alacrity was en route 
from the caribbean island of montserrat where it had been helping 
to clean up from hurricane hugo 
britain will also provide a secure communications network to 
help protect government officials judges and other senior 
colombian figures under death threats from the drug traffickers 
and protective clothing such as bulletproof vests for people at 
risk 
british military advisers will be sent to help train local 
officials in bomb disposal and protection skills and allterrain 
motorbikes will be sent to provide greater mobility for drug 
enforcement teams working in remote areas 
the package was outlined by foreign secretary john major at the 
united nations and by prime minister margaret thatcher speaking at 
a wednesday night reception in london 
what we have offered is certain help after requests from the 
colombians mrs thatcher said of course we in any event try 
to intercept drugs before they come on the seas 
mrs thatcher said there were three steps to tackling the global 
drugs problem 
the first was to stop the countries from growing it because 
thats where the trouble starts she said the second was to 
track down the people who were laundering drugs money and the third 
was to try to stop the demand by warning people she said 
the royal navy is experienced in maritime surveillance having 
for many years patrolled the seas around hong kong searching for 
vessels carrying illegal immigrants drugs and other illicit 
merchandise to the british colony 
capt richard sharpe editor of janes fighting ships said 
the royal navy has developed great expertise both in hong kong 
and in the fisheries protection role in detecting and intercepting 
vessels often these people are armed so you really need people who 
are highly skilled 
finding a drug runner is no different to finding a fast attack 
craft coming in to fire a missile at you sharpe said 
to sort out what you are interested in from a mass of radar 
contacts is where military expertise is invaluable and it is 
something the royal navy trains vigorously for

cambodian guerrillas have after fierce 
fighting seized many areas of western cambodia from which 
vietnamese troops have recently withdrawn a thai army spokesman 
claimed today 
lt gen naruedol dejpradiyuth said fighting between rival 
cambodian factions had intensified over the past month in parts of 
the country close to the thai frontier 
he said it appeared that the three guerrilla factions opposing 
the hanoibacked phnom penh government were taking the opportunity 
of the vietnamese troop pullout to capture key positions 
vietnam said that it had completed the withdrawal of its last 
26000 troops from cambodia on tuesday 
naruedol said a civil war was inevitable in cambodia now that 
the vietnamese have gone hanois withdrawal has given the 
guerrillas their best opportunity yet to oust the phnom penh 
government he said 
he said heavy fighting has been reported in the ratanamondol 
district near the important gemtrading town of pailin 
there were also battles at sisophon in battambang province and 
in the northwestern province of oddar meanchey he said 
the guerrillas have taken many important areas formerly held by 
government troops the thai general said including positions 
opposite the thai border town of aranyaprathet and another further 
north opposite the town of ta phraya 
he said the guerrillas killed many government troops and 
captured 15 
the phnom penh army was forced to bring in 3000 extra troops to 
help defend areas in battambang and oddar meanchey he said the 
new troops came from phnom penh and included draftees from kompong 
cham located northeast of the capital he said 
the general said morale among the government forces seemed low 
and that since sept 20 146 cambodian government soldiers had 
deserted their units and fled to thailand the latest group of 27 
arrived on tuesday he said 
thailand is a major supporter of the resistance details of 
naruedols battlefield reports could not immediately be confirmed 
by other sources 
naruedol said that many heavy shells had fallen into thailand 
from the fighting over the past month three thai villagers had 
been killed in the southern part of the border between the towns of 
chantaburi and trat he said 
on wednesday thousands of refugees at a united nations refugee 
camp on the thai border were forced to flee as hundreds of shells 
landed nearby they were believed fired by cambodian government 
troops reacting to khmer rouge guerrilla operations in the area 
the strongest of the guerrilla factions the khmer rouge has 
claimed several victories recently both near sisophon and around 
the gem trading center of pailin 
phnom penh officials recently have admitted some setbacks at 
pailin 
one official said the khmer rouge was firing up to 2000 mortar 
rounds a day at the town 
the fanatical communist khmer rouge was responsible for the 
deaths of hundreds of thousands of cambodians when it ruled the 
nation between 1975 and 1978 when vietnam invaded 
many cambodians have said they fear a return to power by the 
khmer rouge but phnom penh officials insist their army is capable 
of fighting the guerrillas without vietnamese military support

a soviet cosmonaut and an american astronaut 
have landed in mars on a special educational mission and martian 
school children and just about everybody else in town are on cloud 
nine 
i dont think ill ever forget this because ill probably 
never see a cosmonaut again or an astronaut for that matter 
10yearold mandy rooker said after the spacemen visited her 
classroom at adams intermediate elementary school 
theres a certain pride today said thirdgrade teacher suzi 
wingfield 
cosmonaut sergei krikalev and astronaut mario runco jr spent 
wednesday talking about space travel with students and discussing 
the need for cooperation between the two countries they planned to 
visit other schools in the district today and friday 
children must study for a working future and maybe we will 
work together said krikalev 31 a flight engineer who lives 
near moscow 
its important that they learn that the world is becoming a 
better place to live agreed runco 37 a navy lieutenant 
commander awaiting assignment to his first space shuttle mission 
during a visit with 367 students at the mars primary center 
krikalev received gifts of crayon drawings and homemade soviet and 
american flags letters freshcut flowers and russian tea cakes 
dozens of other drawings and greetings adorned the hallways walls 
welckim to mars one firstgrader wrote on a note 
accompanying a rocket ship made of purple construction paper 
the cosmonaut handed out autographed photographs showing himself 
and his two partners during a fivemonth frenchsoviet soyuz 
mission that ended in april 
its not so much the gifts its the friendliness that went 
behind the gifts its coming from the insides of the people who 
gave the gifts he said through an interpreter 
krikalev later was joined by runco at the intermediate school 
where they addressed 275 second through fifthgraders runco 
presented a slide show and gave the school 485 nasa photographs 
pupils asked them what its like to eat and sleep in a spaceship 
and whether they are nervous about space travel they also wanted 
to know about life in the soviet union and how each man had trained 
i have a question runco said at one point whats it like 
living in mars 
out of this world several in the crowd replied 
krikalev and runco were invited to this small community 25 north 
of pittsburgh by the mars area foundation for educational 
excellence 
the goal was to bring unusual cultural programs to the school 
district and it has blossomed beyond anything i had imagined 
said ralph terrell foundation chairman 
the two visitors were thrilled at the prospect of being the 
first spacemen to set foot in mars 
during a brief jaunt into the center of town each man put on a 
rubber boot and stepped into a tray of brown clay and signed his 
name in the clay the footprints and signatures were sealed in 
glass and marked with a plaque noting that both men stepped on 
mars sept 27 1989 
they also posed for pictures near a spaceship 10 feet in 
diameter made from the lids of steel barrels 
i didnt think id get there this soon runco joked as he 
accepted a blue tshirt emblazoned with the words ive already 
been to mars pennsylvania 
krikalev said he consulted numerous maps and even an american 
acquaintance to find out where mars was before leaving on his first 
trip to the united states he could not locate it and was forced to 
bring clothes for all kinds of weather 
krikalev knows how he will describe mars when he returns home 
early next week 
ill say its a small town he said and the town is very 
friendly

a month after telephone peace was declared 
throughout most of the land negotiators are still trying to bridge 
the long distance between 60000 striking workers and northeastern 
phone companies 
the strike against nynex in new york and new england has gone 
eight weeks it has produced consumer complaints allegations of 
widespread vandalism and little movement on the main issue the 
cost of health care 
talks have been intermittent the first informal bargaining in 
two weeks was scheduled for today in rye brook and in boston 
in august workers staged walkouts against four of the baby bell 
companies formed in the breakup of atampt nynex pacific telesis 
ameritech and bell atlantic all except nynex were back at work by 
the end of the month though pacific telesis workers have since 
rejected a tentative pact 
nynex has insisted that its workers assume as much as 1500 a 
year in health costs 
on that issue nynex is really out there alone away from atampt 
and the other six baby bells said gaye williams mack a 
spokeswoman for the communications workers of america in washington 
the cwa represents 40000 nynex strikers at new york telephone 
a nynex subsidiary they are joined by 20000 members of the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers who work for new 
england telephone another subsidiary 
to the union nynexs stand really looks like a very classic 
and depressing case of corporate greed mack said 
but paul aran an industry analyst with bear stearns noted 
nynex suffered losses in the last quarter 
its not their fault that doctor costs are skyrocketing in the 
double digits its not anybodys fault aran said management 
would like the labor force to pay for part of that increase 
nynexs 105 million customers are paying the price for the 
dispute the new york state public service commission has recorded 
more than 4600 complaints against new york telephone since the 
start of the strike aug 6 there were 11000 complaints filed in 
all of 1988 
management workers have taken the place of union members but it 
is often impossible to get through to directory assistance and 
requests for phone installations often are delayed days or weeks 
in boston the city council has sought to question new england 
telephone officials about service disruptions due to the strike 
the executives have refused and are fighting subpoenas 
today the council was expected to consider a proposal to 
withhold payment of the citys telephone bill until the strike is 
settled 
service problems have been compounded by damage done by vandals 
new york telephone said it has experienced more than 325 acts of 
vandalism affecting 75000 customers since the strike began 
on tuesday the company said service was cut to 12000 
customers using voice and data circuits made of fiberoptics and 
copper on long island in what officials called the worst act of 
sabotage yet 
in response the company quadrupled its reward to 100000 for 
information that would flush out the vandals this sabotage is 
despicable and must be stopped said new york telephones 
president frederic v salerno 
strikers walk picket lines at all nynex installations one 
picket died early in the strike when he was hit by the car of a 
woman who was crossing the line to get to work 
a westchester county grand jury began hearing evidence tuesday 
in the death of 34yearold edward horgan at a nynex office in 
valhalla in suburban westchester county who was fatally injured on 
aug 15 
police said horgan jumped on the hood of the womans car 
pounded her windshield then fell off and struck his head the 
union charges the car struck horgan as the driver sped into work 
the electrical workers union said it intended to reduce its wage 
demands at todays negotiations cwa spokesman bob master would not 
confirm that the cwa planned a similar proposal though the two 
unions have acted in concert 
still the two sides are dug in on the health costs issue 
we are still firm that we are not going to accept payroll 
deductions to maintain health benefits we have not moved on that 
principle said master 
this theory of asking for employees to pay for part of their 
health care costs is our principle and will continue to be said

china charged today that at least 30000 
disguised vietnamese soldiers remain in cambodia and indicated it 
will continue to arm guerrillas fighting that countrys prohanoi 
government until a political settlement is reached 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing devoting much of a 
weekly briefing to criticism of vietnam also renewed charges of 
vietnams brazen violation of chinas territorial sovereignty 
in occupying islands in a disputed south china sea chain 
li refuted vietnams claims of a troop withdrawal and said at 
least 30000 vietnamese troops have changed to the uniforms of 
cambodian government troops 
he contended that large amounts of weapons and military 
equipment have been left behind and that vietnamese officials 
continue to control administrative organs in the puppet regime 
he said hidden among the over 1 million illegal vietnamese 
settlers in cambodia are many vietnamese militiamen and special 
agents clearly there has been no change in vietnams basic scheme 
for keeping cambodia under its control and creating an indochina 
federation 
lis statement came a day after vietnam proclaimed it had 
completed the withdrawal of its last 26000 troops in cambodia 
ending an 11year military presence in that country 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ending nearly four 
years of rule by a khmer rouge regime that sent hundreds of 
thousands of people to their deaths in trying to turn the country 
into a primitive agrarian commune 
asked whether china will continue to arm the khmer rouge and 
other resistance forces li said all countries should stop military 
assistance to cambodia but only after the warring factions in the 
country reach a political settlement and vietnam genuinely 
withdraws all its troops 
vietnam has urged those countries supporting the cambodian 
resistance china and thailand chief among them to stop arming 
the guerrillas saying that only then can a political settelement 
be achieved 
on another matter li said that since june vietnam has sent 
troops to invade and occupy a reef and two shoals in the spratly 
islands an archipelago in the south china sea claimed by both 
china and vietnam 
this is a brazen violation against chinas territorial 
sovereignty he said adding that those islands and others in the 
area have been part of chinas sacred territory since ancient 
times and china has irrefutable sovereignty over all these islands 
and their adjacent waters 
in march chinese naval forces sank three vietnamese ships in an 
exchange of fire off the islands that left more than 70 vietnamese 
sailors dead or missing 
the philippines taiwan and malaysia also claim the islands and 
the surrounding seas which are thought to contain large oil 
deposits

the rudder of a usair jetliner was set wrongly 
before last weeks fatal skid into the east river and that could 
explain the drift the captain said led him to abort takeoff 
according to investigators 
an airline spokesman and the national transportation safety 
board meanwhile dismissed a report wednesday that the crew of 
flight 5050 had been drinking for five hours before getting into 
the cockpit 
the ntsb said the rudder trim in the 737400s cockpit which 
holds the rudder steady had been found in the fullleft position 
that would tend to want to move the plane to the left if he 
didnt do other things to compensate for it ted lopatkiewicz a 
ntsb spokesman in washington said of the pilot 
he said it would be the responsibility of either the captain or 
copilot to set the trim before takeoff 
it clearly could have been one of the factors that led to the 
crash said peter baron who heads the national center for air 
traffic safety in new york a nonprofit consumer advocacy group 
the trim is on the pretakeoff checklist that the captain and 
crew are supposed to go through baron said but he added its 
not the type of thing where youre going to get a warning horn if 
it was misset 
the effect of setting the rudder to the left would not become 
apparent until the plane built up speed during takeoff he added 
capt michael w martin told investigators he aborted the 
takeoff because the aircraft was moving left and he heard and felt 
a strange vibration 
two passengers died in the sept 20 crash and 59 people 
survived the plane was scheduled to fly to charlotte nc 
published reports have said cocaine had been found aboard the 
plane the cable news network citing the ntsb reported wednesday 
that more than a pound of cocaine was found in a piece of carryon 
luggage but not among the holdings of the flight crew 
but the ntsbs chief spokeswoman rachel halterman said we 
dont confirm that thats absolutely ridiculous thats nothing to 
do with us if its true its not a confirmation that would come 
from us 
also wednesday lopatkiewicz and a usair spokesman said the two 
pilots had only about two hours between the time they landed at 
laguardia from baltimore and the time flight 5050 left the gate 
thats documented said david shipley an airline spokesman 
in arlington va 
in addition lopatkiewicz said the copilot was on the plane for 
most if not all of that time while the captain went to usair 
offices at laguardia 
the new york post reported wednesday that a detective close to 
the investigation said the crew may have spent as many as five 
hours before the flight in bars near the airport 
the newspaper said a passenger eric trendel the husband of a 
usair employee told authorities immediately after the crash he had 
been out bouncing with the captain and the copilot 
investigators said they believed he meant drinking or bar 
hopping 
but lopatkiewicz said the ntsb had not turned up any suggestion 
that the pilots went drinking 
trendel may be subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury 
investigating the crash the post said the daily news quoted 
unidentified sources as saying usair also was subpoenaed because it 
had been reluctant to cooperate with the investigation 
drug and alcohol tests on martin and kleissas came out negative 
but the urine samples were taken 48 hours after the accident 
making them useless for alcohol testing

an emigration boom permitted by soviet political 
reforms likely will force washington to turn away more than 200000 
soviets next year after decades of pressing moscow to free 
emigration us officials say 
under new regulations that take effect on oct 1 wouldbe 
emigrants must fill out a questionnaire that will be sent directly 
to washington for consideration 
officials in washington will then send notices to those who 
qualify for interviews at the moscow embassy the system depends 
however on the notoriously slow and unreliable soviet mail and 
us officials acknowledged that people who deserve to emigrate may 
fall between the cracks 
us embassy officials said wednesday they expect 300000 
applications in 1990 but will accept just 50000 refugees an 
additional 20000 to 30000 soviets may enter the country on a 
conditional basis 
besides setting ceilings to contain growing numbers of potential 
us immigrants the new procedure is intended to cut down on the 
long lines outside the us embassy in moscow 
the line to receive an application was said at one point to 
include thousands of people and a spot at the front reportedly 
cost hundreds of dollars in bribes to soviet police 
jews who long have been an american priority worry they will 
now be forgotten refuseniks believe the new procedures will limit 
jewish emigration to the united states at a time when they say 
antisemitism is on the rise in the soviet union 
the situation here is getting worse elena rappoport a 
leader of the jewish refusenik group poor relatives said in an 
interview 
the us has said the 1990 soviet immigration ceiling is higher 
than the roughly 50000 soviets the united states will admit this 
year 
there is a limit to the number of soviet emigrants and to the 
number of emigrants the united states can take a us embassy 
official said on condition of anonymity 
under the new regulations threequarters of the spaces are 
likely to go to applicants with relatives in the united states 
members of groups considered to be persecuted in the soviet union 
such as jews and pentacostalists are also considered a priority 
jews will no longer be able to leave the country on an israeli 
visa and then apply for admission to the united states in vienna or 
rome where thousands are now waiting 
jews and armenians together still make up the vast majority of 
the applicants but us officials are seeing large increases in 
applications from others since president mikhail s gorbachev 
liberalized emigration procedures 
they said 10 percent or more than 1000 of the applicants in 
august were ethnic russians few with relatives in the united 
states 
one wouldbe applicant 18yearold vladimir azarov of moscow 
said he had some brushes with the law because of his political 
views and wanted to receive political refugee status 
its not that i have a big reason to leave the soviet union 
its just that i want to live in the united states he said 
the united states is appealing to other western countries to 
help the us embassy official said 
nowhere is it written that the united states should be the 
only destination of soviets who want to emigrate

with the purchase of columbia pictures sony 
corp is acquiring some of the most treasured american films ever 
made from the classic drama lawrence of arabia to the classic 
slapstick of the three stooges 
the giant japanese electronics manufacturer announced the 34 
billion deal wednesday giving it another foothold in the us 
entertainment industry 
sony bought cbs records for 2 billion last year while looking 
for properties to provide records and movies it hoped consumers 
would use with its stereos and videocassette recorders 
the columbia deal will give it control of a major production 
studio a film library of 2700 movies and 23000 episodes of 
television programming in 260 series 
columbia was attractive because of its successful stable of 
television productions and its two film studios columbia pictures 
and tristar 
among sonys new holdings will be 11 films that have won academy 
awards as best picture including two with themes that were 
antijapanese from here to eternity in 1953 climaxed with the 
japanese bombing of pearl harbor that drew the united states into 
world war ii the bridge on the river kwai in 1957 portrayed 
inhumane conditions in a japaneserun prison camp 
columbias other best picture winners were it happened one 
night 1934 you cant take it with you 1938 all the 
kings men 1949 on the waterfront 1954 lawrence of 
arabia 1962 a man for all seasons 1966 oliver 1968 
kramer vs kramer 1979 and gandhi 1982 
columbia began in 1920 as the cbc film sales co using the 
initials of its founders brothers harry and jack cohn and harry 
brandt the founders changed the name to columbia pictures in 1924 
harry cohn led columbias rise in a tiny studio on hollywoods 
poverty row and the companys growth accelerated with the 1928 
arrival of frank capra who promptly directed seven films 
capras movies of the 1930s including it happened one 
night lost horizon and you cant take it with you 
helped establish columbia as a major studio 
cohn and columbia produced some of the most popular and 
sophisticated films of the 1930s and 40s one night of love 
the awful truth here comes mr jordan the jolson 
story cover girl all the kings men among columbias 
stars were rita hayworth glenn ford william holden kim novak 
broderick crawford and judy holliday 
in 1952 cohn formed a subsidiary screen gems to produce tv 
series the film division continued to thrive with such hits as 
born yesterday the caine mutiny and the bridge on the 
river kwai 
columbias television arm remains hugely profitable making 155 
million on revenue of 620 million in the companys last fiscal 
year ended feb 28 
the television division has been boosted by newer shows such as 
whos the boss 227 and designing women while 
continuing to receive revenue from such older productions as its 
more than 200 three stooges shorts the films made between 
1934 and 1958 are frequently shown on television 
with harry cohns death in 1958 columbia became host to 
independent producers such as sam spiegel lawrence ray stark 
funny girl the way we were carl foreman the guns of 
navarone otto preminger anatomy of a murder and stanley 
kramer guess whos coming to dinner 
columbia sold its sunset and gower studios in the heart of 
hollywood in the late 1960s and moved production to the burbank 
studios which it shares with warner bros inc 
the cocacola co purchased columbia in 1982 
despite the softdrink empires attempts to inject its 
production and marketing techniques into the movie business its 
film divisions declined tristar could not produce a solid hit and 
columbia sponsored the disastrous ishtar 
in 1987 cocacola combined columbia and tristar into a new 
company columbia pictures entertainment and retained a 49 percent 
interest while distributing part interest to cocacola shareholders 
during cocacolas ownership columbias loews theatre 
management corp took off loews acquired in 1986 is among the 
nations five biggest theater chains with more than 800 screens in 
220 locations 
still columbias motionpicture arm has drifted in recent 
years with projects like ghostbusters ii the karate kid 
iii and casualties of war failing to become runaway hits

a youth broke into tears as he described 
why he beat his mother to death with a baseball bat on the evening 
before he was to graduate as valedictorian of his high school class 
but the show of emotion didnt sway niagara county court judge 
charles j hannigan who on wednesday rejected william shrubsalls 
petition that he be granted youthful offender status and sentenced 
him to 5 to 15 years in prison 
hannigan rejected defense attorney paul clearys contention that 
shrubsall had been physically and emotionally abused for years and 
that the abuse led to the beating death of marianne marge 
shrubsall in the familys niagara falls home on june 25 1988 
in this case from my way of seeing it i dont think we have 
any real physical abuse hanningan said and i dont believe 
there was any emotional abuse to any significant degree 
shrubsall 19 was originally charged with seconddegree murder 
in the death of his 56yearold mother but the charge was reduced 
to manslaughter june 6 following a plea bargain 
cleary argued for about an hour that shrubsall was entitled to 
youthful offender status which would have reduced his sentence 
significantly and made it possible for the conviction to be 
expunged from his record 
under state law shrubsall must serve at least 5 years of his 
sentence before becoming eligible for parole 
at the sentencing hearing shrubsall said the level of violence 
in his house was getting worse since his father died two years 
before after my father died there was no one there to defend 
me he said crying 
that was not the cleavers said cleary referring to the 
idyllic family portrayed on the television series leave it to 
beaver this was not a happy household this was a relationship 
with problems 
but in refusing the youthful offender petition hannigan said he 
thought shrubsall came from basically a normal household 
hannigan ordered the sentence be stayed until it could be 
reviewed by an appeals court he allowed shrubsall to remain free 
until the appeal is decided

comic jackie mason says he was just joking but 
he agreed to stop mayoral campaigning after saying democratic 
candidate david dinkins looks like a black model without a job 
and claiming jews will vote for him out of guilt 
the remarks published wednesday in the village voice ended 
masons affiliation with the campaign of republican mayoral 
candidate rudolph giuliani 
mason is withdrawing from the campaign because he didnt want 
this matter to deflect from the importance of the campaign said 
charles perkins a giuliani spokesman perkins said giuliani was 
troubled by masons remarks 
at a news conference mason tried to show he is not racist by 
producing a 100 canceled check he sent to the naacp in 1988 and 
having a black agent jim willis attest that mason had hired a 
number of black singers for his shows 
as for his remark that dinkins looks like a model mason said 
i dont think a joke like that means anything i said much worse 
jokes about jews 
he said he supports giuliani because hes a great crimefighter 
and blacks are suffering from crime more than anyone else i wanted 
him to help the minorities and the poor of this city so now all of 
a sudden they call me a racist 
dinkins said he was not particularly offended by the remarks 
but added i can say that that kind of comment is not helpful to 
our city 
mayor edward i koch who lost the primary to dinkins and a 
number of leading jewish organizations issued statements denouncing 
masons remarks 
mason also was quoted by the voice as having said there is a 
sick jewish problem of voting for a black man no matter how unfit 
he is for the job jews are sick with complexes he later 
called that remark stupid 
the comedian said he was exaggerating to prove a point when 
asked to comment on his remark that the jews are constantly 
giving millions of dollars to the black people have you ever heard 
of a black person giving a quarter to a jew

the university of mississippi has banned a 
fraternity for leaving two members naked and painted with racial 
slurs at a mostly black college 
the universitys chancellor wednesday said the incident had 
opened an old wound at ole miss which erupted in violence in 1962 
when its first black student james meredith enrolled 
nothing can totally undo the effects of the deplorable events 
of september 18 gerald turner said in announcing he accepted a 
hearing panels recommendation to shut the beta theta pi chapter 
for three years 
he gave the fraternity a week to close its house 
unquestionably this action of the few has reflected very 
negatively on the university community in such a way as to deny the 
significant advancements in human relations that have occurred on 
campus in the past few years turner said 
the two fraternity members were carried by car to rust college 
a small private school 25 miles to the north and their hands and 
feet bound with duct tape before they were released the two were 
picked up by rust security officers 
members of the fraternity which had been active at the 
university for 110 years refused to comment wednesday turner said 
the 90member chapter suspended earlier by its national 
organization wouldnt appeal the ban 
the chancellor said about 15 students may have had leadership 
roles in the incident and some may be expelled 
students faculty and the state chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people had called for 
harsh penalties an naacp official also asked for a federal 
investigation into racial discrimination by fraternities at the 
10370student university 
its sad the entire fraternity has to suffer because of the 
actions of a few but the punishment is acceptable to us said

despite difficult living conditions that were aggravated by heavy 
rain 
botho prinz zu saynwittgenstein president of the west german 
red cross and foreign ministry officials left for prague to review

not enough room in the tents some adults slept on stairwells and 
three people shared one cot

said democracy was at stake in the fight against the drug cartels 
this criminal organization wants to destroy the most precious 
thing colombians have their democracy he said 
the peace treaty with the m19 guerrilla movement is a major 
achievement for barco congressional approval is however needed 
for major aspects of the accord which was signed at a guerrilla 
base camp in the andes mountains 
the treaty calls for m19s estimated 2000 rebels to turn in 
their weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form a 
political party it also calls for a national referendum on 53 
proposals including land reform and programs to provide more 
housing for the poor 
congress would have to approve a change in the constitution to 
allow a referendum and any pardons barco said he will put the 
proposed treaty before lawmakers next week 
the peace treaty would end almost eight years of negotiations 
colombias politicians and lawmakers are divided over whether 
the government should pursue peace with the drug traffickers barco 
has refused to consider negotiating with drug lords 
the drug terrorists do not respect the sacred right to life 
they have threatened the press and they have trampled laws he 
said 
since the crackdown began authorities have seized 1056 
properties believed owned by the drug lords including mansions 
ranches and businesses as well as 525 vehicles 74 boats and 375 
airplanes barco said 
he said 10800 people have been arrested and 535 charged with 
crimes linking them to drug traffickers

for three days estelle ray searched 
frantically for a generator to power her daughters kidney dialysis 
machine after hurricane hugo knocked out electricity to her home 
civil defense had none each time she heard about one for sale 
from north carolina to virginia it was sold by the time she called 
i was real scared she said 
a generator was finally located monday with the help of a 
supervisor at a bank where another daughter wendy worked the 
generator was working in her home tuesday 
it was a blessing i mean a great blessing from god mrs 
ray said 
until the generator was hooked up mrs ray had to do the work 
of a dialysis machine manually to save the life of her 19yearold 
daughter nicole without dialysis poisonous wastes created by her 
body could kill her 
using the manual method fluid had to be drained from a tube in 
nicoles stomach and fresh fluid replaced at least four times a day 
each time mrs ray or wendy changed the fluid there was the 
chance for infection 
i almost died one time before and i dont think you could be 
that lucky twice nicole said i just thought maybe id be one 
of the deaths that hurricane hugo caused 
matters were compounded when the citys water system shut down 
i said we cant scrub were going to have to do the best 
that we can mrs ray said 
her luck changed when wendy talked about her sisters problem 
with her boss kenneth richey a senior vice president at a bank 
he rounded up a generator 
i think that was good for someone to care that much about 
someone they do not even know and someone who is not their 
responsibility because he never heard of me or met me nicole 
said 
richey said he bought 30 generators to operate the banks 
automatic teller machines in charleston and several other cities 
and he gave one to the rays 
somebodys got to help her you just do it richey said

yugoslavias parliament today asked 
the supreme court to urgently rule on whether the northern republic 
of slovenia has the right to secede from the federation 
amendments to slovenias constitution adopted wednesday give its 
legislature the right to secede and provide for strict controls by 
slovenia over the use of the yugoslav armed forces in the region in 
peacetime 
they also pave the way for introduction of a westernstyle 
multiparty democracy in the republic bordering on italy and 
austria several independent opposition parties have already been 
formed in the republic 
antislovenian protest rallies and staterun media in some 
southern parts of yugoslavia demanded tough action against the most 
liberal of its six member republics 
slovenian authorities have repeatedly stressed they do not plan 
to secede and that the changes only provide an added sense of 
security for the 2 million slovenes who make up about 8 percent 
of yugoslavias population 
but slovenias actions have met with strong opposition in 
serbia whose leadership advocates limiting regional autonomy and 
introducing greater central controls 
enactment of the changes came in the wake of warnings by the 
federal leadership that they conflicted with the national 
constitution there was even speculation that martial law might be 
imposed in the region 
authorities dissuaded several thousand belgrade students from 
staging a demonstration today in front of the downtown federal 
parliament building university sources told the associated press 
the students were demanding that the federal authorities take 
all necessary measures to ensure the integrity of yugoslavia the 
sources said 
belgrade radio reported a spate of smaller protest gatherings in 
several towns in the countrys largest republic of serbia up to 
50000 people demonstrated in montenegro on wednesday demanding 
the toppling of the slovenian leadership 
zarija martinovic a serbian deputy in the federal parliament 
demanded that yugoslavias constitutional court immediately review 
the constitutionality of the slovenian action 
but marjan rozic a slovenian asked that the court also 
consider all other constitutional amendments including serbias 
which caused demonstrations by ethnic albanians in the southern 
province of kosovo in march that left at least 24 people dead the 
changes gave serbia more control over the province 
both proposals were accepted by the parliament the state tanjug 
news agency said 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure the 
decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in 1974 to prevent one republic from 
gaining sway over the others but it has resulted in an ineffective 
government by compromise

defense minister yitzhak rabin picked up a key 
endorsement today amid growing signs he might be able to unseat 
finance minister shimon peres as leader of the leftleaning labor 
party 
rabin 67 a career army officer who served as prime minister 
from 1974 to 1977 won the backing of labor party dove ezer 
weizman a former air force chief who is now science minister 
if today the question would be him or my good friend shimon 
peres to lead the party to peace and elections i think rabin is 
the man to do it weizman said on israel radio 
another labor dove ely benmenachem also indicated he favored 
rabin over peres who has led labor since 1977 should early 
elections be called and the party convened to choose a leader 
but labor legislator avraham burg said in an interview that he 
believed peres would win any showdown in the party even though 
rabin had more public support at the moment 
peres has a firmer grip on the party machinery he said 
the leadership issue is not likely to come to a decision unless 
the coalition between labor and the rightwing likud bloc of prime 
minister yitzhak shamir breaks apart and new elections are called 
a laborlikud split is likely only if there is a serious move 
toward israelipalestinian negotiations on the future of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip labor favors returning land in 
exchange for peace while likud opposes any yielding of territory 
labor party insiders said rabin who has been defense minister 
since 1984 improved his standing with labor doves as a result of 
his meeting earlier this month with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak 
outside the party rabin has garnered the respect of 
rightwingers by taking a tough line against the palestinian 
uprising in which more than 570 palestinians and 40 israelis have 
died 
rabin has the best of both worlds hanoch smith an 
independent pollster said in an interview by dealing toughly 
with the intefadeh uprising he has won support from likud and 
religious parties while getting support from laborites because he 
favors a landforpeace settlement 
smith said a survey now being completed is expected to show a 
continuing upward trend in support for rabin who has been 
outpolling both peres and shamir since the coalition government was 
created last year 
rabin who served as armed forces chief of staff during the 1967 
middle east war became prime minister in 1974 after golda meir 
stepped down 
he was forced to call new elections after losing the support of 
a key religious party he then lost the party leadership and 
resigned as premier after his wife leah was revealed to have an 
illegal bank account abroad

a hurricane hit charleston again but this time 
it struck only on the stage of the metropolitan opera as the met 
presented porgy and bess on the third night of its season 
director arvin brown artistic director of the long wharf 
theater in new haven conn intensified some of the stage action 
and changed the location of one scene the hurricane on wednesday 
night instead of everybody going to a rickety leanto near the 
ocean they take shelter in serenas room it isnt as 
fearinducing for the audience but its better dramatically because 
its more sensible 
michael smartt and priscilla baskerville sang porgy and bess 
making their love story more real than many singers make it 
they both made their met debuts in 1985 in small parts in the 
opera smartts voice has intrinsic dignity it isnt loud but his 
words can be understood 
miss baskerville isnt a flamboyant bess though crown turns her 
head with sex appeal and sportin life turns it by giving her dope 
to sniff this bess seems to be her real self when shes with porgy 
ben holt tall and slim was sportin life he was directed 
oddly being intimidated by the matrons of catfish row in act 1 and 
acting rather adolescent singing it aint necessary so in act 
2 he was an entertainer at the picnic moving like a dancer only 
in act 2 singing theres a boat thats leavin soon for new 
york did he seem the suave pied piper of happy dust 
his voice was focused with an interesting attractive timbre 
oddly in an opera in which events are large and not genteel 
smartt miss baskerville and holt made this listener desire to hear 
all of them in recital 
gregg baker was crown almost the only cast member recreating 
his role from the 1985 met opera premiere of gershwins 1935 opera 
surely the met has nobody else as suitable as crown baker is built 
like an athlete tall and broad his chest is bare a couple of 
times so the effect isnt missed and he picks up bess like shes 
a feather his voice is strong and compelling too 
marvis martin sang clara singing summertime with sweet 
clarity 
camellia johnson sang serena and marjorie wharton of 
philadelphia a notable maria was one of 10 singers making met 
debuts 
mezzo linda thompson of brooklyn and tenor lynn randolph of new 
york were able to make an impression in the tiny but noticeable 
roles of early morning sellers of strawberries and crabs 
james levine conducted without flagging hes conducting the

polands new noncommunistled government is 
getting warm words of encouragement from president bush and other 
western leaders but few promises of fresh aid in the countrys 
historic economic transformation from state control to free 
enterprise 
polish finance minister leszek balcerowicz warning of 
potentially explosive social conditions appealed to western 
democracies wednesday for 15 billion to maintain essential 
imports and stabilize its currency 
we must do more agreed president bush speaking at the 
annual meetings of the world bank and the 152nation international 
monetary fund 
however bush mentioned no specific figure for us help beyond 
the 219 million in food and economic aid already pledged he told 
reporters later the amount of aid hinged on the details of polands 
reform package 
we want to work with them in every way we can but i think 
its important to see what their plan is for economic reform the 
president said 
the imf and world bank international lending agencies 
established 44 years ago to foster economic stability and 
development are wrapping up their annual meetings today 
delegates have been discussing a wide variety of topics in 
addition to eastern europe ranging from the third worlds crushing 
13 trillion debt burden environmental problems such as the 
global warming trend and efforts to reduce the us trade deficit 
by stabilizing currency exchange rates among the major industrial 
nations 
world bank president barber b conable today said his 
organization before deciding on when to resume lending to china 
will look closely at the outcome of a conference next month at 
which chinese leaders will decide on the countrys economic program 
for the next three years 
coming out of that will be interesting signals about their 
intention of moving ahead with economic reform he said at a news 
conference 
the world bank in june held up 780 million in loans to china 
following the massacre of student demonstrators in tiananmen square 
and the imposition of martial law 
in a development on the latin debt problem argentine president 
carlos menem who met with bush at the white house on wednesday 
announced that his country had reached agreement clearing the way 
for an imf loan argentina is the third largest debtor in the 
developing world with 60 billion owed imf officials said 14 
billion would be disbursed through 1990 
balcerowicz has been busy drumming up support for his government 
with an address to the imf and world bank on wednesday and with a 
round of oneonone meetings this week with world finance officials 
the most senior polish leader to visit washington since a 
government led by the trade union solidarity came to power on aug 
24 balcerowicz met with treasury secretary nicholas f brady and 
the finance ministers of japan west germany great britain france 
and italy 
balcerowicz said i would hope that results would be 
forthcoming quite quickly 
he has been outlining polands plan to curb runaway inflation 
prop up the faltering currency turn over staterun enterprises to 
private ownership encourage entrepreneurship and create a new 
marketbased financial system 
to aid the effort poland is seeking two major packages from the 
west one of 490 million to 500 million is needed by december 
to maintain imports of essentials such as medicine and fertilizer 
another 1 billion is needed for reserves to stabilize the 
faltering zloty polands currency 
both requests are separate from polands effort to secure loans 
from the world bank and imf balcerowicz did not mention an amount 
but juergen warnke west german minister for economic cooperation 
told reporters the imf was considering 700 million a year 
balcerowicz stressing that his governments measures likely 
will cause unemployment and other distress focused on the urgent 
need for foreign aid saying the polish reform movements chances 
of success would be considerably enhanced by fast efficient 
substantial and sustained economic and financial support 
he drew immediate backing from democrats in congress who are 
rallying support for food and economic assistance packages for 
eastern europe that total at least 37 billion most of it 
earmarked for poland 
sen alan cranston dcalif called bushs aid proposal 
pathetically timid and majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said the administrations timidity in the face of these 
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying 
finance leaders of other nations joined bushs call for aid to 
the poles but they shared his concern that aid be linked to 
changes in poland japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto 
west german finance minister theo waigel and great britains 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said poland must agree 
to a program of economic reforms with the imf as a first step

a former top housing official was the key 
figure to see for developers seeking federal grants even after he 
left the department of housing and urban development former 
regional housing officials say 
the official lance h wilson became the fourth former top hud 
official to refuse to testify when he appeared wednesday before a 
house subcommittee probing alleged influencepeddling and 
mismanagement at the agency 
as former hud secretary samuel pierce did a day earlier wilson 
asserted his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
wilson said he had been labeled a prime candidate for a criminal 
investigation and said he was convinced the subcommittee had 
already prejudged me 
also on wednesday a former hud staffer told of investigating a 
project on behalf of a contributor to president bushs 1980 
campaign for the vice presidency 
the senate banking committee meanwhile resumed today its 
parallel investigation of hud during the eight years it was headed 
by pierce 
paul adams huds inspector general described how hud officials 
disagreed with suggestions for tightening the departments troubled 
coinsurance program which used private lenders to handle 
hudbacked loans and which has led to mortgage losses estimated so 
far at 960 million 
he said his recommendations in audits conducted in 1984 and 1988 
were rejected by hud officials as unfair and likely to discourage 
lender participation adams credited new hud secretary jack kemp 
with moving to tighten the program 
but sen bob graham dfla called for a more urgent response 
and denounced former hud management for indolence in the 
management of this program 
alexander naclerio a former director of housing in huds new 
york area office who became a consultant after retiring in 1986 
told the house panel wednesday he paid wilson 15000 for help in 
getting hud grants for two projects after both men had left the 
agency 
naclerio said he asked wilson for help because he felt politics 
were harming his ability to get hud approval for the projects in 
puerto rico and new york city 
i felt i was getting the political zing naclerio said i 
called lance wilson and i related to him the story 
naclerio also said wilson called him in 1982 and asked him to 
look into a project in puerto rico wilson indicated this was on 
behalf of a major contributor to george bushs vice presidential 
campaign delio rojo naclerio testified 
the washington post reported today that hud officials whom it 
did not identify had said that an unidentified aide to bush asked 
wilson to meet with rojo about the project 
the newspaper said aides to vice president bush said they made 
referrals to government agencies without endorsements 
rojo consultant carlos figueroa said he arranged the 
rojowilson meeting on his own and probably discussed the matter 
with rafael v capo an aide to the vice president 
wilsons refusal to testify made him the fourth topranking 
former hud official to refuse to answer questions before the house 
panel 
deborah gore dean who replaced wilson as pierces executive 
assistant and r hunter cushing a former deputy assistant 
secretary at hud refused to testify on constitutional grounds in 
earlier appearances 
another former hud regional administrator dick eudaley of fort 
worth texas said wednesday there were a few people who could 
make things happen at headquarters one of these was mr wilson 
and another was ms dean she depended on him for a lot of her 
instructions 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the house government 
operations employment and housing subcommittee said he wanted to 
question wilson about a series of hud projects he worked on after 
leaving the department 
one lantos said involved a gift to wilson from developer 
leonard briscoe of a 15 percent interest in a 24 million riviera 
beach project in florida while at hud two years earlier lantos 
said wilson had backed a 7 million grant application for a fort 
worth texas project that was pushed by briscoe 
i knew the deal was happening but i knew there was nothing i 
could do about it eudaley said the feeling within the agency 
was that this project had the personal interest of the secretarys 
office and mr wilson 
although he did not testify wilson issued a written statement 
saying the fort worth project met hud criteria and that he urged it 
receive a fair hearing because he felt there was a lack of 
receptivity to minority applicants in some hud regional offices 
wilson is on paid leave from his job as first vice president of 
paine webber group inc

vice president dan quayle today 
called for allout support for noncommunist resistance factions in 
cambodia to help prevent a comeback by the khmer rouge 
quayle declined however to say whether his comments meantthe 
united states had been sending military assistance to those 
factions 
i dont comment on matters like that but i want to reaffirm 
our strong support for the noncommunist resistance we need to 
make sure that they have credibility that they have resources 
that they can participate efficiently in a resolution in 
cambodia quayle told a news conference before leaving for 
washington at the end of his fournation asian tour 
quayle arrived in malaysia from the philippines where president 
corazon aquino said today she has accepted an offer to begin talks 
on extending the lease on us military bases but she said there 
can be no certainty the talks will produce agreement 
quayle said earlier he was confident the two sides would reach 
agreement during the december talks that would guarantee the 
longtime involvement of the united states in the philippines 
the lease expires in september 1991 
quayle said that in malaysia he had conferred with the us 
heads of mission from thailand indonesia malaysia and singapore 
on how to cope with the situation in cambodia following a 
vietnamese troop pullout that hanoi said was completed this week 
the talks reaffirmed our view the khmer rouge must not return 
to power and assistance must be given to the noncommunist 
factions he said 
the fanatical communist khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 
until it was toppled by a vietnamese invasion in late 1978 it now 
is the strongest faction in a resistance coalition that also 
includes two noncommunist groups 
with the vietnamese troop pullout the resistance is fighting 
troops of the phnom penh government installed by vietnam 
the issue of american assistance to noncommunist resistance is 
sensitive vietnam has called on foreign countries to cut off aid 
to the resistance 
quayle said the association of southeast asian nations and us 
positions on the khmer rouge did not differ and both did not want 
to see the khmer rouge in power 
asean a major backer of the resistance coalition includes 
malaysia singapore thailand indonesia the philippines and 
brunei 
in the philippines on wednesday police hurled tear gas to 
disperse 2000 leftists demonstrating against quayle and the bases 
at least 157 people were arrested 
quayle handed mrs aquino a letter from president bush 
suggesting new talks on extending the bases lease despite growing 
opposition among filipinos to their presence 
in announcing her agreement to the december talks mrs aquino 
said in a statement 
this only means that a panel the composition of which is 
still under study will meet with an american panel the 
discussions may or may not lead to a new bases agreement the 
philippine panel will be guided by what we believe to be in our 
national interest and no other 
in a departure statement quayle said he would personally convey 
mrs aquinos acceptance to bush when he returns to washington from 
his asia tour 
i am confident that we will find a mutually acceptable 
agreement on the future of the facilities in the philippines he 
added 
any agreement on extending the bases lease must be ratified by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to the bases 
is strong at least 12 senators have called publicly for them to be 
closed in 1991 
before departing quayle toured the battlefield on corregidor 
island where us and filipino forces were defeated by the 
japanese during world war ii 
quayles visit was also marked by the killing of two american 
civilians slain near a us base hours before he arrived tuesday 
police suspect communist rebels were responsible 
about 40000 american troops civilian employees and military 
dependents are stationed at the six us installations including 
clark air base and the subic bay naval base

top nasa officials have questioned whether the 
space agency is depending too much on private contractors and 
risking loss of control over operations costs and safety 
according to a report published today 
i am deeply concerned over the continuing erosion of our civil 
service capability wrote james r thompson jr nasas deputy 
administrator in a letter to federal budget director richard g 
darman 
the letter written after darman asked each federal agency to 
assess itself was obtained by the new york times under the freedom 
of information act 
in the letter thompson wrote that the budget offices effort to 
convert more and more critical functions to contractors is 
taxing nasas management and supervisory abilities the times 
reported 
weve been stretched to the point where its troubling to me 
given the oversight thats required he wrote 
crucial parts of nasas work are dependent on vendors he noted 
thompson said bolts have been falsely certified by contractors 
and that substandard or counterfeit electronic parts could have 
created safety problems if they had not been detected

the chairman of the democratic party 
describing president bush as offering the nation timid leadership 
called on the republican president today to begin matching his 
actions to his charming words 
it would be wonderful to have an american president seize this 
time of change and begin leading the world again ronald h brown 
told a meeting of the democratic national committee 
the party chairmans speech reflected his earlier statements 
that it was time to start taking on george bush and it 
received an enthusiastic response from his partisan audience 
are we going to go forward with a public spirit a commitment 
to doing what it takes at every level of american society using 
every american political institution asked brown or are we 
going to continue the ethic of greed humming the lemminglike 
melody dont worry be happy 
brown attacked the bush antidrug program as big words 
followed by limited action they declared war and decided 
somebody else is going to have to find the bullets 
the democratic chairman said the first thing the president was 
willing to fight for was a cut in the capital gains tax a 
massive needless tax break to the wealthiest one percent a 
giveaway that will cost working americans billions 
when it comes down to risking his polling numbers when it 
comes to leading america rather than timidly following the 
prevailing winds george bush hasnt come through said brown 
lets be clear for our country which we love for our people 
and as a party we hope president bush changes his course and 
begins matching his actions to his charming words 
the nearly 400 members of the dnc also were ready to roll back 
part of a party rules compromise reached at atlanta in 1988 the 
dnc members also were set to require that they have a voice when 
any such deals are cut in the future 
as part of its attempt to become more aggressive the dnc began 
airing a 30second advertisement on cable news network that 
attacked bushs proposal to cut taxes on capital gains 
the ad featured house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
saying george bush wants to raid the treasury by reducing 
capital gains taxes for the superrich and he wants you to pay for 
it 
the house is debating the tax plan and some democrats are 
supporting the president 
the dnc members were poised to restore their status as automatic 
unpledged delegates to national conventions a role they lost in 
the compromise reached between michael dukakis and jesse jackson at 
the atlanta convention in 1988 
brown was the principal negotiator for jackson at that 
convention but supported negating that part of the compromise 
remaining intact was the decision to drop the requirement that 
candidates in presidential primaries and caucuses must receive at 
least 15 percent of the vote to be awarded delegates 
the socalled 15 percent threshold was dropped at the insistence 
of jackson but party officials at the dnc meeting were freely 
predicting it will be restored for the 1992 convention 
it can be done any time said james ruvolo the ohio 
democratic party chairman who is president of the association of 
state democratic chairs 
i think youll find support for restoring the threshold from 
a lot of quarters said ruvolo 
in another look ahead to 1992 the democrats were getting an 
early start on choosing the site for their next nominating 
convention the list already has been narrowed to eight cities 
new york houston detroit clevelandbrook park seattle new 
orleans miami beach and atlanta 
the democrats met in atlanta in 1988 while the republican 
convention was in new orleans 
several major cities including los angeles san francisco 
dallas and chicago told the democrats they wouldnt bid for the 
1992 convention most cited the requirement that the party have 
unlimited access to the convention hall for three months prior to 
the convention the city of dallas told the democrats that 
requirement would force the city to cancel nine major trade shows

the ukrainian communist party today ended the 
17year reign of one of the nations last oldguard conservatives 
and replaced him with a protege of president mikhail s gorbachev 
in a competitive secret ballot 
in a meeting attended by gorbachev the ukrainian party accepted 
the resignation of vladimir v shcherbitsky and appointed vladimir 
a ivashko the tass news agency said 
shcherbitsky 71 was retired from the ruling communist party 
politburo on sept 20 in a move that cemented gorbachevs hold on 
the party and shcherbitskys removal as ukrainian party chief had 
been widely expected 
other than gorbachev himself he was the last politburo member 
from the days of nowdiscredited former president leonid i 
brezhnev and was widely regarded as one of the most conservative 
forces on the politburo 
ivashko the no 2 ukrainian party leader was pitted in a 
secret ballot against another party official stanislav gurenko 
tass said it did not say what the vote total was but it said 
ivashko received solid support from ukrainian regional party chiefs 
who participated in the balloting 
analysts say gorbachev probably has been a patron of ivashkos 
for some time and that his writings indicate he is a firm backer of 
the soviet leaders reforms 
gorbachevs decision to participate personally in the meeting 
showed the significance he attached to making the change the 
partys general secretary would not ordinarily be present for the 
changing of a republic party chief 
two years ago gorbachev went to a moscow city party committee 
meeting to fire maverick boris yeltsin and he traveled to 
leningrad in july to retire that citys party chief yuri f 
solovyev who had been defeated when he ran unopposed for a seat in 
the new national parliament 
ukrainian reformers blame shcherbitsky for squelching dissent 
and holding back gorbachevs economic reforms in the nations 
breadbasket the ukraine with 50 million people is second only to 
russia among the soviet unions 15 constituent republics 
gorbachev waited until this year to challenge shcherbitsky 
perhaps because of shcherbitskys personal power base or because he 
feared an outbreak of ukrainian nationalism or other political 
unrest 
in february as the country prepared for its first nationwide 
competitive elections in 70 years gorbachev made a fiveday 
campaignstyle trip through the ukraine promoting his reform 
program known as perestroika and upstaging shcherbitsky at each 
stop he met with leaders of a fledgling local reform movement that 
has since mushroomed and spoke to workers in the streets 
encouraging them to oust their oldstyle bosses 
immediately after gorbachevs departure shcherbitsky cracked 
down again on protesters and political opponents but opposition to 
him grew he was rejected three times when he sought nomination for 
a seat in the national congress of peoples deputies and finally 
ran successfully in donetsk where he remained politically secure 
the surface calm that shcherbitsky struggled to maintain with 
police power was rocked again in july when coal miners in the 
donetsk region the countrys largest coalproducing area joined a 
strike that began in siberia to protest living conditions and the 
administration of their mines

braniff inc filed for bankruptcy protection today for the 
second time in seven years and laid off 2700 employees but 
company officials said they were confident they could rebuild as a 
smaller carrier 
the actions came a day after the cancellation of flights through 
the carriers home base of orlando fla and its major kansas 
city mo hub as rumors of the bankruptcy filing drove its stock 
price down 
all but four flights between kansas city and two major braniff 
destinations were scrubbed hundreds of passengers were stranded at 
many airports and many employees complained about being left in the 
dark about the companys plans 
the company has suffered a liquidity problem as a result of a 
delay in completing recently announced financing and a softening of 
airline traffic and yields in recent months said william g 
mcgee chairman president and chief executive officer 
braniff sought protection from creditors to allow it to 
reorganize under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code at about 2 
am in orlando where lawyers took the petition to a judges home 
said don mcguire an airline spokesman 
we expect to operate four flight segments thats nonstop 
services between two cities today and we want to raise that to 
more than 40 by monday mcguire said well gradually expand 
the service 
todays flights will be between kansas city and orlando and 
kansas city and dallas the company said 
the airline said it is reducing the number of cities it serves 
from 36 to 11 the 11 are san diego los angeles san francisco 
phoenix dallas chicago kansas city orlando new york la 
guardia newark nj and washington dc national 
braniff lost 318 million on revenue of 293 million in the 
first six months of the year 
our goals are to operate a smaller and efficient airline 
said mcguire 
the layoffs were beginning today reducing the payroll to about 
2000 employees the companys work force includes an estimated 
2000 employees in kansas city 1165 in orlando and 450 in dallas 
braniff also extended the expiration date of issued tickets 
until sept 27 1990 
mcgee said the company was confident there will be a place in 
the us travel market for the type of small carrier braniff will 
be when it emerges from chapter 11 
in the current airline environment major airlines enjoy a 
distinct competitive advantage over smaller carriers in the use of 
their computer reservations systems frequent flier programs 
pricing and control of facilities and slots at capacitycontrolled 
airports he said 
on wednesday rumors that braniff planned to file for protection 
pushed the stock down 175 in overthecounter trading to 3125 a 
share 
the airline issued a terse statement late wednesday saying it 
began canceling selected flights at 245 pm edt and some 
additional flights would be scrubbed later 
braniff had given no explanation for the action or the state of 
the airline in general 
the passengers were stranded at kansas city international 
airport after braniff canceled about 30 departing flights airport 
administrator del karmeier said the airline put some passengers on 
other flights he said 
its mad just mad said andrew meyer of houston who was 
among those stranded 
braniff filed for chapter 11 protection in 1982 with nearly 1 
billion in debts the first major casualty of deregulation of the 
domestic airline industry begun four years earlier it emerged from 
bankruptcy protection and started flying again in 1984 as a 
lowcost nofrills carrier last may it moved its headquarters 
from dallas to orlando 
last may mcgee announced an aggressive program that included 
expanding the work force by 35 percent ordering more than 2 
billion worth of new aircraft and constructing new maintenance 
depots in orlando and kansas city 
the following month an investor group led by painewebber group 
inc acquired the airline shifted most of its flight operations to 
kansas city and began trying to attract more business travelers by 
increasing its daily schedules

president corazon aquino said today 
the body of ferdinand marcos cannot be returned from exile for 
burial because his funeral could inflame passions and create civil 
unrest 
but opposition leaders including the vice president called on 
her to reconsider her longheld position in the interest of 
national unity 
in marcos home province where he is still widely revered 
people wept when they learned of his death 
senior military commanders met after the death was announced 
but there was no sign of extraordinary security or of any 
promarcos demonstrations 
one marcos supporter oliver lozano said loyalists will stage a 
symbolic funeral march to protest but he did not say when 
we consider the banning of president marcos return as an act 
of unforgiveness and oppression because there is not a 
constitutional and factual basis to the reason of president 
aquino he said 
mrs aquino said in a statement in the interest of the safety 
of those who will take the death of mr marcos in widely and 
passionately conflicting ways and for the tranquility of the state 
and the order of society the remains of ferdinand e marcos will 
not be allowed to be brought to our country until such time as the 
government be it under this administration or the succeeding one 
shall otherwise decide 
mrs aquino who came to power on feb 25 1986 after a 
militarycivilian uprising ended marcos 20year rule issued the 
statement within an hour of the announcement that he had died in 
hawaii where he lived in exile 
marcos death was announced after the close of the business day 
in the philippines and there was little overt reaction to the 
passing of the man who ruled longer than any other filipino leader 
manila radio stations interrupted their programming to announce 
the death and news organizations were flooded with calls asking if 
the report were true 
of three people approached on the street one had not heard of 
the death and the other two said they did not care 
in the united states white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said president bush was saddened to hear of marcos death he 
said marcos permitted the peaceful transition to popular 
democratic rule by agreeing to go into exile 
several us lawmakers said that despite marcos 
accomplishments he left power in disgrace 
although she offered condolences to marcos family mrs aquino 
also urged filipinos to pray that we preserve the gains won in 
the uprising that ended marcos rule 
she had refused to let him return for the funeral of his mother 
josefa edralinmarcos who died may 4 1988 her body which has 
been embalmed several times remains at the family home in batac 
230 miles north of manila 
there people mourned marcos death with tears 
we are all sick at heart said gigi nalupta 29 by 
telephone from the town in ilocos norte province we loved him 
very very much 
the rev ruben abaya the roman catholic priest in batac said 
special masses would be celebrated friday 
in the hearts and minds of the people here marcos is the 
greatest son of batac he said i can foresee great mourning in 
the entire ilocos norte 
shortly before the aquino statement today vice president 
salvador laurel asked her to consider her longheld position and 
let marcos be buried at home 
laurel a leading opposition figure during the marcos era said 
his death closed a bitter period in the nations history and that 
the former dictators body should be returned from exile for burial 
my family and i wish to express our deep sympathy to the 
bereaved wife and children of the late president ferdinand e 
marcos said laurel who broke with mrs aquino last year and 
organized his own opposition party the passing of former 
president marcos should now close a painful chapter in our history 
and put to rest all bitterness and rancor that have divided our 
people 
i know therefore ask president corazon aquino to allow the 
remains of the former president to be brought home and buried in 
his hometown with all the honors due a former head of state of this 
country 
let us now strive to bring about national reconciliation 
which we failed to achieve during his lifetime 
sen juan ponce enrile also urged mrs aquino to allow the 
return of marcos body enrile served as marcos longtime defense 
minister but then led the february 1986 military mutiny that 
triggered the uprising that swept mrs aquino to power enrile was 
fired as defense minister on nov 23 1986 after a failed coup 
against mrs aquino by his followers 
i agree with the position that the marcoses should return 
here enrile said in a radio interview i am calling on the 
president to allow him to return this would give people who 
believed in the former president to give his due 
but senate president jovito salonga a longtime marcos opponent 
said he will support mrs aquinos decision salonga also said he 
would pray for the repose of the soul and condole with all the 
members of his family 
in her statement mrs aquino said marcos touched the life of 
every filipino who was his contemprary as no other filipino leader 
did before him 
his rule changed our country she said in what ways he 
changed it i leave for now to others and ultimately to history to 
describe for at this moment of passage we must allow such a loss 
to transcend for his family politics and history and the 
opinions of men and women no one should trench on the dignity of 
this painful moment in the life of a family 
i personally condole deeply with the family he leaves behind 
with all sincerity for i and my children know the pain of such a 
loss 
mrs aquinos husband former sen benigno aquino was 
assassinated in august 1983 moments after he arrived at manilas 
airport to challenge marcos for leadership of the country he had 
been in selfimposed exile in the united states forty people 
mostly soldiers are on trial for his murder 
mrs aquino has foiled six armed attempts to overthrow her 
government and marcos supporters are believed responsible for some 
of them 
sen agapito aquino the presidents brotherinlaw said he did 
not expect major disturbances following marcos death however he 
also said lets not be complacent because anything that could 
lead to a destabilization should be curtailed at the onset 
jesus valdez a former commissioner of the security and exchange 
commission said marcos death may encourage stability because it 
deprived promarcos groups of their symbolic leader 
in his statement white house spokesman fitzwater said for 
over 20 years mr marcos was the leader of the philippines a 
nation that has been and remains a staunch friend and ally of the 
united states 
mr marcos agreed to leave the philippines at a critical 
juncture in his nations history his departure permitted the 
peaceful transition to popular democratic rule under president 
aquino 
us rep gus yatron dpa chairman of the house foreign 
affairs human rights subcommittee said any contributions marcos 
made were overshadowed by many years of dictatorial rule and 
repression which has left the philippines in an economic shambles 
and threatened by powerful communist insurgency 
gerald solomon rny a longtime former member of the house 
foreign affairs committee said marcos was a true friend and ally 
of the united states but should have relinquished power before he 
was ousted

mississippis 5th district congressional 
seat is being fought over by a protege of the republican who held 
the seat for 16 years the state attorney general and a 
hardcampaigning state senator 
the seat became vacant last month when freshman rep larkin 
smith a republican was killed in the crash of a small plane 
the candidates in tuesdays open primary where all candidates 
run in one race are tom anderson longtime aide to us sen 
trett lott rmiss state attorney general mike moore and state 
sen gene taylor who lost to smith a year ago anderson is 
republican moore and taylor are both democrats 
lott held the 5th district post for 16 years before winning 
election to the senate in 1988 smith viewed as a rising gop star 
was sworn into office in january 
if no candidate wins a majority tuesday the top two 
votegetters will meet in a runoff oct 17 
although democrats control most statehouse offices the 5th 
district which skirts the gulf coast has been held by 
conservatives since the 1932 election of the late bill colmer a 
democrat colmer held the post until 1972 when he was succeeded by 
his thenaide lott 
lott threw his support to anderson 45 his chief congressional 
aide for 16 years anderson has roots in the populous mississippi 
gulf coast but has spent his adult life in washington where he 
owns pizza parlors and rental property it is his first political 
race 
moore 37 took office in january 1988 and also has strong ties 
to the gulf coast while taylor is a twoterm legislator who is the 
only one of the trio who has ever run for congression 
taylor 36 got 46 percent of the vote against the betterknown 
smith in the november 1988 general election taylor has counted on 
his name recognition to continue his doortodoor campaign style 
some people note that moore and taylor are both natives who have 
stayed in mississippi while anderson worked for lott in washington 
and served a brief tenure as ambassador to barbados 
moore has been criticized for wanting to leave the attorney 
generals office after only 21 months he is considered as 
political ambitious as mississippis youthful governor ray mabus 
taylor has had to contend with an 8000 deficit from his 1988 
congressional race and deep inroads into his conservative 
democratic support by moore 
the war on drugs has been a recurring theme in the campaign with 
anderson contending that during his two years as ambassador to 
barbados he was the reagan administrations point man against the 
drug lords in the caribbean 
moore has countered that he was prosecuting drug dealers while 
anderson was in washington serving as nothing more than lotts 
righthand man 
the only thing he pointed at was the planes as they flew over 
loaded with dope moore has said of andersons service in the 
caribbean 
taylor has stayed out of the political ambushing

of louisianas chemical belt is no greater than in any other part 
of the country tulane university scientists said

from his hiding place author salman rushdie has 
teamed up with his french publisher to sue a magazine for printing 
an unofficial translation of the satanic verses illustrated by 
sexually explicit drawings 
emil malet director of the trendy intellectual magazine 
passages was quoted today in the daily liberation as saying 
rushdie is suing the magazine despite the fact that it admitted it 
made a mistake and withdrew most of the issues in question 
passages in july became the first magazine in france to publish 
selections from rushdies controversial novel it published them 
along with drawings that rushdies publisher christian bourgois 
called frankly scatological 
fortyeight hours after meeting with bourgois malet withdrew 
the issue from newsstands he said and also removed 3000 posters 
advertising the issue only 5000 of 75000 copies were sold he 
said 
nonetheless rushdie and bourgeois filed suit in july asking 
48000 for counterfeiting the translation without rushdies 
authorization a hearing is set for oct 4 
the publisher and rushdie found offensive the magazines 
headline explosive the prophets satanic women rushdies 
erotics as well as the drawings by illustrator willem 
malet said that by filing suit rushdie and bourgois were trying 
to kill the magazine 
does rushdie want our death malet was quoted as telling the 
leftist french daily liberation we have no money if were

by christian bourgois has sold very well whats more we defended 
rushdie whom we compared to voltaire he was quoted as saying 
bourgois was not available for comment

the government today announced a plan for 
expanded distribution of a drug that appears to be effective in 
stopping replication of the aids virus 
the plan for wider distribution of dideoxyinosine or ddi marks 
the first time the food and drug administration has agreed to make 
such an experimental drug so widely available so early in testing 
the fda said 
under the plan ddi would be available to about 2600 people 
with aids or aids related complex in controlled clinical trials to 
test the effectiveness of the drug against zidovudine known as azt 
the plan also would make ddi available to people with aids or 
advanced aids related complex who cannot take azt the only 
fdaapproved drug that directly combats the aids virus and those 
for whom the disease is progressing despite azt and who have no 
other treatment options 
bristolmyers which holds the license to manufacture ddi has 
said it will distribute the drug at no cost under the plan 
the plan is an interim measure to make a promising 
investigational therapy available for people with aids who do not 
have satisfactory treatment options the department of health and 
human services said in its announcement 
hhs secretary louis sullivan said the plan reaffirms our 
commitment to speeding both the development and the availability of 
promising new drugs for patients with aids whenever possible 
aids activists also applauded the departments action mark 
harrington of the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash power 
or actup said this is the start of something weve been 
working for for a long time lets use this as a good precedent 
and build on it 
the plan is the first demonstration of a concept that has been 
under consideration by officials at the public health service an 
hhs division that includes the fda and the national institutes of 
health to make promising aids drugs available to more people 
earlier during testing 
they have called the concept parallel track meaning that a 
drug would be made available to people with aids in clinical trials 
as well as to those who cannot participate in the trials 
the first phase of clinical trials during which dosage is 
examined have been completed on ddi by the national cancer 
institute and the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases 
these studies showed that while ddi appears promising it has 
toxicities related to the dose taken thus its use requires 
careful monitoring the department said in its announcement 
the drug has sparked great expectations among people with aids 
partly because earlier studies on the drug showed it could be 
tolerated by most aids patients with less servere side effects as 
those associated with azt 
however more recent data indicates that some patients taking 
higher doses of ddi have experienced painful nerve damage to the 
feet and damage to the pancreas these side effects appear to be 
reversible if they are detected early and the drug is stopped the 
department said 
the department also cautioned despite the promising early 
results with ddi it is important to emphasize that zidovudine 
azt is the only drug with proven efficacy for the treatment of 
patients with aids and advanced arc aids related complex 
the second phase of clinical trials are scheduled to begin soon 
under the plan these studies are intended to provide more data on 
whether the drug is safe and effective 
the department also said that while bristolmyers is not 
charging for the cost of the drugs people receiving it are likely 
to incur charges for costs of physician and laboratory costs

a new round of arms talks in which negotiators will be under 
pressure to get a treaty slashing longrange nuclear arsenals ready 
for signing at next years summit 
prospects for progress in the 4yearold negotiations were 
improved by soviet concessions at weekend talks between foreign

baker iii in wyoming but officials on both sides also warned

catalyst for moving forward on the draft strategic arms reduction 
treaty or start shevardnadze told the un general assembly of 
realistic prospects for halving superpower nuclear arsenals by 
the summit 
however defense secretary dick cheney said the soviets are 
modernizing their armed forces and still threaten the very 
survival of the united states despite gorbachevs promised 
cutbacks and pledges of reform

round of talks the first full meeting of both delegations is 
scheduled monday it is not known how long the session will last 
start is intended to cut by up to 50 percent the land air and 
seabased nuclear missiles with which each superpower can strike 
the other both sides have already agreed to lowered ceilings of 
missiles bombers and nuclear warheads 
yuri nazarkin chief soviet negotiator in geneva said he could 
predict the chances of early agreement only after washington 
formally responds at the bargaining table to the recent soviet 
moves 
shevardnadze removed a longstanding obstacle by announcing 
moscow would no longer let its objections to us plans for 
spacebased missile defenses block signing of a start pact moscow 
also agreed to a us demand for dealing with seabased cruise 
missiles outside start 
the bush administration earlier dropped its demand for a ban on 
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles provided congress 
approves funding for such missiles the soviets have such missiles 
but the united states does not

clerics led an estimated 7500 
blacks on an antiapartheid march through this conservative mining 
town thursday and police stood aside as part of a new policy to 
allow peaceful protests 
the demonstration began in the black township of galeshewe and 
moved into kimberley where protesters handed a list of demands to 
police that included lifting the state of emergency and freeing 
activists detained without trial 
marchers sang and danced and some carried the banners of the 
outlawed communist party and the african national congress 
guerrilla movement 
volunteer marshalls guided the marchers police were present but 
did not intervene and no incidents were reported 
several dozen whites joined the march 
there have been a series of mass demonstrations across the 
country since president fw de klerk announced sept 13 that 
authorities would not break up peaceful protests given prior 
approval by the government 
most approved rallies in the past two weeks have been peaceful 
except for some minor looting at a march last week in the 
southeastern city of pietermaritzburg 
in pretoria police used clubs and dogs saturday to disperse 
some women trying to proceed with a march that was not authorized 
the demonstrations have spread from the major cities of 
johannesburg cape town and durban to smaller more conservative 
towns such as kimberley oudtshoorn and east london 
they are part of a nationwide protest campaign launched in early 
august by antiapartheid groups opposed to the system of legal 
racial segregation that denies the black majority a voice in 
national affairs 
under the system the white minority controls the economy and 
government and maintains separate schools districts and health 
facilities 
on tuesday city officials in johannesburg voted to open public 
amenities such as buses and swimming pools to blacks 
the african national congress the main guerrilla movement 
fighting the government on thursday dismissed the move as 
insignificant 
anc spokesman tom sebina speaking from anc headquarters in 
lusaka zambia said the move would only be relevant if apartheid 
were abolished throughout the nation

colombian president virgilio barco assured the 
united states today it had properly shaped its emergency military 
aid to help his government battle drug traffickers but he sought 
more help on the economic and trade fronts according to drug 
control policy director william j bennett 
the administration is weighing options for assisting colombia 
economically while it battles the traffickers us officials have 
said trade concessions are being considered for some colombian 
exports such as cut flowers and textiles among other products 
another possibility is providing inducements for us private 
investment in colombia 
president barco talked about an array of things including 
trade issues such as coffee and flowers bennett said adding that 
he referred the matters to us trade representative carla hills 
with whom barco was to meet later today 
a number of these things well take up again later at a 
meeting at the white house with president bush bennett said 
after the hourlong meeting with barco and colombian gen guillermo 
munoz sanabria that was held under tight security at the colombian 
ambassadors residence 
during the meeting the officials discussed the current 
situation in colombia where barco ordered emergency measures to 
crack down on drug traffickers following the aug 18 assassination 
of leading presidential candidate luis carlos gala 
those measures including the resumption of extradition to the 
united states of suspected drug traffickers prompted the 
traffickers to declare total war on the government they have 
set off bombs around the country killed several people at the 
bogota airport and have vowed to kill 10 judges for every 
trafficker extradited 
some colombian officials have said the 65 million in emergency 
us assistance does not suit their needs they have said they need 
better police equipment to help track down the traffickers while 
the us aid is primarily military equipment such as helicopters 
and other troop transport vehicles as well as training by military 
advisors 
i was reassured by all present that the assistance we were 
providing was the right assistance it helped bennett said 
barco who is to address the united nations general assembly on 
friday has become a white house favorite since his government 
began cracking down in earnest on cocaine cartels last month 
a report surfaced wednesday that colombian drug barons had 
threatened to kidnap one of bushs children if the two governments 
dont back off their antinarcotics campaigns 
bush said he wont be deterred by rumors adding he has 
confidence in the ability of the secret service to do its job 
bushs meeting with barco was taking place against a background 
of a uscolombian disagreement over trade in coffee colombias 
main legal export 
last week bush rejected a plea by barco for a oneyear 
reinstatement of a coffeeexport quota system that had been 
beneficial to colombian farmers 
colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74nation 
international coffee agreement collapsed in july after united 
states pulled out in a dispute with coffeeproducing nations over 
prices 
colombian officials have suggested they will have an even more 
difficult time persuading hardpressed colombian farmers to grow 
coffee instead of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip 
the administration announced several weeks ago it is sending 65 
million worth of equipment to colombias police and military forces 
to combat cocaine smugglers 
britain announced wednesday it will give substantial 
antiterrorist aid training communications and other help to 
colombia in its drug war british foreign secretary john major made 
the announcement to the un general assembly in new york but he 
did not mention a dollar amount 
before leaving for washington barco told colombians that 
democracy was at stake in the fight against cocaine traffickers 
this criminal organization wants to destroy the most precious 
thing colombians have their democracy he said in a speech 
tuesday 
administration officials said there has been a significant 
disruption in the cocaine industry as a result of the colombian 
governments crackdown the price of semirefined coca paste is 
down to 600 a kilogram from 1200 before the crackdown the 
officials said 
barcos visit comes on the heels of a peace accord his 
government signed on tuesday with the leftist m19 guerrilla group 
the treaty calls for m19s estimated 2000 guerrillas to turn 
in their weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form a 
political party 
the treaty also calls for a national referendum on 53 proposals 
including agrarian reform to give land to peasants and programs to 
provide more housing for the poor

out of view of sunburned tourists 
sipping rum punch in yacht clubs the inhabitants of the caribbean 
islands struggle daily with poverty and the vestiges of colonialism 
in americas back yard 
for many hurricane hugo swept that struggle into view and 
brought to the surface the bitter divisions of a predominantly 
black society in which whites control the land the jobs and the 
food 
from the slave revolts of the 1700s and early 1800s to 
modernday coups revolutions gang warfare and food riots the 
history of the caribbean is punctuated by civil strife 
this century the united states occupied haiti for 15 years 
until 1934 twice occupied the dominican republic in 1916 to put 
down a civil war and in 1965 after the assassination of gen rafael 
trujillo and led an invasion of grenada in 1983 to oust a marxist 
junta 
now the bush administration has sent more than 1000 military 
police to st croix in the us virgin islands in response to 
widespread looting and virtual anarchy in the aftermath of hugo 
tourists and other witnesses gave varying versions but it 
appears hundreds of people of all ages went on a fourday looting 
spree after the storm battered st croix on sept 17 the national 
guard acknowledged that some of its members took part and several 
witnesses said police were involved some tourists said they had 
heard gunshots and begged to be taken off the island 
by the time federal troops arrived sept 21 supermarket shelves 
were bare and merchandise ranging from toys to jewelry had been 
cleaned out of the other stores so that there was hardly anything 
left to loot 
the disturbance shattered a veneer of tranquility that had 
enveloped st croix in the years since tourists were scared away by 
the killing of eight whites including four american tourists by 
five black men at the fountain valley golf club on sept 6 1972 
in the virgin islands which calls itself the american 
paradise tourism is the no 1 industry with 15 million 
visitors a year spending more than 500 million 
former territorial sen alicia torres james said reports of 
white residents and shopkeepers arming themselves against 
machetewielding gangs of blacks were wildly exaggerated 
i came out of my roofless house at 6 am and yes i saw some 
looting she said but people were taking food and things they 
needed for their houses 
others said the looting developed into a nonviolent 
freeforall adults accompanied by children were seen casually 
picking through merchandise and many gave their names to reporters 
and allowed themselves to be photographed 
some feel it was the lack of police or military authority on st 
croix after the hurricane that provoked looting on a scale that did 
not occur in its sister island of st thomas or anywhere else in 
the stormstruck region 
i can understand people getting food and getting supplies 
said alex pelovitz 31 who owns a computer business and has lived 
in st croix for eight years but i cant understand people 
getting lawn mowers and refrigerators and vcrs it was more of a 
party than anything else 
the disturbance was probably as much rooted in economics as in 
racial tension said pedro rivera an economist at the institute of 
caribbean studies in san juan 
in a situation of survival more or less if youre from the 
poor group that is one way of trying to survive he said of the 
looting it was not an uprising of blacks against whites he 
said 
twothirds of the virgin islands 106000 population is of 
african descent a quarter are from puerto rico and other caribbean 
islands and migrants from the states make up most of the rest 
black resentment of wealthy white property owners and tourists 
is pervasive in the caribbean rivera said particularly in 
englishspeaking former british colonies such as jamaica where 
black nationalism played an important part in independence 
movements 
it doesnt manifest itself in terms of any overt act but in 
terms of the way the tourist is seen and the way he is treated 
he said its sort of like a person serving the master but 
resenting it inside 
penny feuerzeig executive editor of the virgin islands daily 
news on st thomas said race relations have improved in recent 
years but there is still resentment among native virgin islanders 
against the betteroff whites who freely move in from the united 
states and buy up prime property and businesses 
in particular she said unemployed blacks are offended by young 
collegeeducated whites who come to the virgin islands on a lark 
and get a job three days after they arrive at the airport 
it creates social strains with racial overtones she said

injured or killed by artillery rounds out of the impact area this 
is it he said the round landed at a time when the soldiers 
were in a formation and were in close proximity 
the cause of the accident was under investigation dobbs said 
two possible explanations were that the howitzer was aimed 
incorrectly or the wrong amount of gunpowder was used 
remnants of uniforms and helmets littered the ground on the 
rifle range in the shadow of the wichita mountains the site was 
roped off and reporters were kept from talking with soldiers a 
crater a yard across and a foot deep was visible

a jury today began deciding whether the 
night stalker killer should live or die after a plea from a 
prosecutor to face this type of evil without flinching and give 
richard ramirez the death penalty 
the panel on sept 20 found the 29yearold devilworshiping 
drifter guilty of 13 murders and 30 felonies in the crime spree 
that terrorized california during the summer of 1985 
the jury also found special circumstances that made him eligible 
for the death penalty but the panel could also recommend life in 
prison without parole 
defense lawyer ray clark acknowledging the horror of ramirezs 
satanic killings argued that even if ramirez was possessed by the 
devil he deserves mercy 
i think its inescapable that something was wrong with 
ramirez and we dont know what it was said clark lets say 
we believe he was possessed if there is such a thing then the 
extension of mercy goes to the devil because he is considerably 
more in need of mercy than anybody else 
richard ramirez has no claim to your kindness clark 
told the jury but if you give him kindness then thats what 
mercy is 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin urged death in the gas 
chamber for ramirez whom he described as a miserable human 
being who killed for gratification 
halpin argued that jurors must not be afraid to confront the 
evil of ramirez acts and vote for his execution 
it is very difficult for us as human beings to face this 
type of evil without trying to deny it without trying to 
rationalize it without trying to explain it away the prosecutor 
said in a hushed courtroom 
you have to look this case right in the face he told 
jurors if anyone has ever earned the death penalty richard 
ramirez has i urge you to vote for the death penalty 
the shaggyhaired ramirez wearing his blue jail uniform at his 
own request paid no attention to either lawyer choosing instead 
to chat quietly with members of the defense team at the counsel 
table 
earlier in the day ramirezs attorneys announced they would 
call no witnesses in the penalty phase of his trial because ramirez 
didnt see any need to put his life on display 
attorney daniel hernandez who said he had 100 witnesses lined 
up to testify about ramirezs value as a human being and his 
early life in el paso texas told reporters he abandoned the plan 
at ramirezs request 
i felt and he felt he didnt particularly want to lay his life 
out for the public and the court to scrutinize said hernandez 
i wanted to give him the last grain of dignity human dignity 
and spare him that

at least 40000 people linked arms and sang 
we shall overcome in this remote village thursday to protest a 
planned dam project that would wipe out farm land and forests and 
leave about 1 million people homeless 
protest organizers said the participants who traveled by bus 
trucks tractors and even on horseback live along narmada river 
one of indias longest and holiest waterways 
the protesters joined hands and formed a 4milelong chain to 
symbolize their determination to save harsud and 572 other villages 
that will go under water if the dams are constructed 
environmentalists social workers film stars and politicians 
called for the project to be permanently shelved 
we shall not move the dam is our doom the protesters 
chanted 
the rally was organized by the save marmada committee which has 
spearheaded a yearold campaign against the narmada valley project 
the plan calls for construction of four major dams and about 
3000 smaller dams on the 805milelong narmada river and its 41 
tributaries 
environmentalists say the project would destroy an estimated 
865500 acres of forests 495000 acres of farming land and force 
an estimated 1 million people to leave their homes 
they also contend that some of the countrys richest 
archeological sites and oldest fossils would be under water 
we chose harsud to symbolize the protest because it is the 
largest village that will be submerged by the projhect said 
vinod raina spokesman for the save narmada committee 
harsud a town of 15000 people in central india is 15 miles 
from the river which originates at amarkantak in madhya pradesh 
state and flows through the states of maharastra and gujarat it 
empties into the arabian sea 
the government said it plans to proceed with the project which 
is expected to generate electricity irrigate fields and solve 
drinking water problems in gujarat which is often plagued by 
drought 
the government said it would provide land elsewhere for 
displaced villagers but most dont want to leave their homes 
i dont want to drown in narmada water and i dont want to 
leave the village where i was born and grew up said bhure singh 
a 55yearold farmer singhs village mallan goan would be 
submerged if the plan drafted in 1948 is carried out 
during the speeches youngsters went through the crowd seeking 
autographs from film stars and other celebrities in the crowd 
if my village is drowned this autograph book will remind me 
of this day said 15yearold mavin jain

soviet socialism should get out of the housing 
business and turn it over to a system condemned for decades as the 
root of evil private ownership a lawyer was quoted as saying 
thursday 
the lawyer a movye of moscow said in the communist party 
daily pravda that giving away millions of stateowned apartments to 
their occupants would save the cost of maintaining them make 
people more mobile and save the hassle of selling individual 
apartments only to those who can afford full price 
besides he argued people have already paid for the basically 
shabby array of stateowned apartments through a variety of 
indirect taxes people also pay a nominal rent 
pravda ran movyes lengthy article on its second page under the 
headline more profitable to give than to sell and with the 
subheading for the agenda of the supreme soviet it appeared 
the newspaper was endorsing the idea but it might merely have been 
endorsing discussion of the issue 
movyes proposal came at a time when some members of the supreme 
soviet legislature are urging that a measure of private property be 
reintroduced into a system that has crushed most forms of private 
ownership 
a law on property is going before the legislature during the 
fall session that opened monday and a group of reformminded 
deputies on sunday endorsed a call for legalization of private 
property 
the groups leader boris yeltsin told supporters last week he 
believes 10 percent of the property in the soviet union should be 
turned over to private owners 
movye said economic reforms that include cutting unneeded 
workers in a drive for greater efficiency are going to redistribute 
the soviet work force and the only way to ensure housing in new 
areas is to take it out from under central control 
currently about one in five soviet families must share 
apartments the vast majority of apartments are owned by the state 
are cramped and rented for very low prices 
a minority own their own apartments in cooperative buildings 
and in rural areas people are allowed to own or build their own 
houses or summer cottages 
a kremlin directive calls for every soviet family to have its 
own apartment by the year 2000 
but where should they be built in what cities movye asked 
no planning or other kind of agency is in a position to make such 
an accounting in a huge country 
people will be more willing to move for work purposes if they 
think they can obtain an apartment on their own rather than wait in 
line for a stateowned apartment he said 
movye in criticizing current law limiting the rights of 
cooperative owners to sell their apartments appeared to support 
the idea that people should be allowed to buy and sell the homes 
the government would give them 
the government now spends large sums of money as a landlord on 
upkeep and staff for its buildings and could trim those sums from 
its deficit budgets if apartments simply were given away to their 
occupants 
i think it is necessary not to sell but to freely 
transfer to personal property all apartments in buildings of the 
state and social funds he said 
in other words reestablish social justice and transfer to 
workers that which by right belongs to them he said although 
people pay the nominal rent they have basically paid the 
government for construction costs with a variety of hidden taxes 
he said 
the piecemeal sale of some apartments is no solution because 
private and state ownership in government buildings is 
incompatible movye said 
he said the legislature should form a committee to deal with 
soviets who because of special privilege live in especially large 
apartments 
movye also attacked the system of residence permits by which it 
is illegal for soviets to live anywhere without first receiving 
permission from local authorities 
while workers in virtually any country are free to move to find 
new work if they lose their jobs soviets are tied down by their 
residence permits he said 
some radical lawmakers also have called for elimination of the 
residence permits

marcos had never given up hope of returning to his homeland at 
his 71st birthday party marcos told thousands of supporters i 
am no scoundrel i will go back i intend to go back at any 
price without violence 
a federal grand jury in new york indicted marcos his wife and 
eight others on racketeering charges in october in april a judge 
separated marcos from the other defendants saying he was too ill 
to stand trial 
in an interview in november marcos denied he and imelda had 
drained the philippines of billions of dollars and said he did not 
expect to live through a trial 
ill take my destiny whatever that may be but im going to 
fight for my dignity and honor he said 
a staunch us ally during his presidency marcos said he felt 
betrayed by the american justice system but held no hard feelings 
for reagan or bush associates said he had hoped for a presidential 
pardon 
marcos was elected president of his asian homeland in 1966 and 
ruled longer than any other philippine president but in his second 
fouryear term he declared martial law under which thousands of 
opposition politicians students and other critics were jailed 
finally in 1986 he was toppled by a popular uprising and fled 
in disgrace he left behind a nation of 62 million people deep in 
debt and facing dual uprisings of communist and moslemsecessionist 
guerrillas 
once in hawaii marcos claimed he had been tricked by us 
authorities into leaving his homeland but mrs aquino forbade his 
return 
besides the racketeering indictment which charged him with 
stealing 103 million and using it to buy real estate and artwork 
in the united states marcos faced lawsuits and investigations in 
honolulu los angeles seattle washington dc virginia and his 
native country 
the philippine government claimed marcos and his associates 
embezzled up to 10 billion and stashed the funds abroad but it 
never brought charges 
saudi financier adnan khashoggi who once was believed to be the 
worlds richest man was arrested in switzerland in april and later 
extradited to the united states on charges of helping the marcoses 
hide their riches 
marcos was regarded even by his enemies as a clever politician 
and strategist who understood his people better than any other 
philippine president 
the eldest son of a lawyer and a schoolteacher ferdinand 
edralin marcos was born sept 11 1917 in sarrat about 250 miles 
north of manila 
as a young man marcos received the highest scores on the 
national bar exam during world war ii he claimed to have led a 
guerrilla band against the japanese occupiers of the philippines 
but these claims were later largely discredited his supposed 
warhero status helped him at age 31 become the youngest 
representative elected to the philippine congress 
in 1954 after an 11day courtship marcos married imelda 
romualdez a 26yearold beauty queen she bore him three children 
imelda in 1955 ferdinand jr called bong bong in 1958 and 
irene in 1960 the marcoses claimed another child aimee as their 
own but she is actually mrs marcos grandniece 
during her husbands tenure imelda marcos wielded nearly as 
much power as her husband she was known for lavish shopping sprees 
and was subjected to worldwide ridicule after the couples ouster 
when it was discovered she owned 3000 pairs of shoes while 
filipinos suffered in poverty 
as president marcos reduced widespread street violence built 
more than 60000 miles of roads and 3354 schools and brought 
electricity to thousands of rural villages 
but he also abolished the congress rewrote the constitution 
imposed martial law jailed tens of thousands of opponents and was 
accused of widespread human rights abuses including murder 
the pivotal event in marcos downfall was the assassination of 
political rival sen benigno aquino jr who was gunned down in 
1983 as he returned from selfimposed exile in the united states 
the slaying which filipinos blamed on marcos and his supporters 
galvanized the opposition to the longtime president 
stunned by a mass revolt betrayal by several key military aides 
and pressure from the united states marcos and his family fled 
manila feb 25 1986 leaving the presidency to mrs aquino the 
slain politicians widow 
after an aborted attempt to overthrow mrs aquino in 1987 a 
coup bid many attributed to marcos the expresident was barred 
from leaving the island of oahu without us permission

the government announced thursday it 
is seeking a 25 percent cut in lowlevel flying exercises that have 
been the target of national protests since a crash at an air show 
last year killed 70 people 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg introduced the proposed 
reductions aimed at cutting noise and protecting populated areas 
from accident hazards during a session of the parliaments defense 
committee 
stoltenberg told reporters later that the changes were worked 
out in conjunction with the united states and other nato countries 
that have aircraft and pilots stationed in west germany 
one tactical training center involved in lowlevel flying 
exercises is being relocated to neighboring belgium and 
negotiations are continuing with other allies to export more of the 
missions stoltenberg said 
of the 68000 hours of lowlevel training exercises flown over 
west german territory this year only about 23000 involve west 
german air force aircraft and personnel 
west germans have staged noisy demonstrations over the past year 
against lowflying and other military exercises 
the protesters have accused the government of failing to assert 
its sovereignty in getting nato to reduce the number of disruptive 
maneuvers turning the issue into a major political battle between 
the governing conservativeled coalition and opposition leftists 
opposition has intensified since aug 28 1988 when three 
italian planes crashed during an air show at the us air base at 
ramstein seventy people died when the flaming wreckage flew into 
the crowd of spectators 
another crash on dec 8 in the city of remscheid killed six 
west germans and the american pilot 
neither of the disasters involved lowflying exercises but they 
stirred up broad opposition to the foreign military presence in 
west germany 
the leftist social democrats have been campaigning for a ban on 
lowlevel training flights 
a full halt to lowlevel flying would put our commitment to 
the nato alliance in question stoltenberg told reporters 
instead he said the ministry has worked out a number of 
measures to address public concerns including 
a 25 percent reduction in lowlevel training flights over west 
german territory 
a 50 percent reduction of west german air force training 
flights already put into force 
an increase in the number of areas offlimits to exercises 
from 25 to 61 densely populated municipal regions 
a midday break in the exercises in summer months and no 
flights on weekends and holidays 
reduction of maximum allowable speeds from 1336 mph to 1244 
mph to cut noise from the exercises 
as the measures already reportedly have allied backing they are 
expected to be approved by the parliament

a disproportionate number of black children 
wind up in foster care homes because of poverty abuse and neglect 
according to a study released thursday 
such children are also unlikely to be reunited with their 
parents in a reasonable period of time according to the 
report who will care when parents cant the study was 
conducted by the national black child development institute an 
educational and advocacy group 
in our study we found that the black child in foster care has 
lived and is still living an uncertain and fragmented existence 
said clarice walker a howard university professor and chief 
investigator in the study 
in 1986 when the study was conducted there were 275000 to 
350000 children of all races in foster care systems around the 
country she said black children accounted for 25 percent to 40 
percent of the total the numbers are approximate because of poor 
record keeping she said 
the study looked at 1003 children in foster care programs in 
five cities new york miami houston detroit and seattle 
almost half the children or 49 percent were age 5 or younger 
at placement fortysix percent came from singleparent households 
the median age of mothers when a child was placed in foster care 
was 29 of fathers 34 the study found 
seventyfive percent of all children who entered the foster care 
system were there because of abuse or neglect the study found 
in detroit miami and new york neglect was the no 1 family 
factor contributing to foster care placement in houston child 
abuse was first and in seattle voluntary placement topped the 
list 
drug abuse by parents was the second most prevalent family 
factor in new york miami and seattle the study found half the 
cases in new york and miami reported drug abuse by parents 
in new york city alone 43 percent of the cases studied found 
the children were unattended or unsupervised upon entering the 
foster care system 41 percent of the cases reported return of the 
parent was uncertain 
sometimes the children themselves have physical or emotional 
problems that contribute to their winding up in foster care the 
study noted 
however it found that overall the proportion of 
childrelated factors contributing to placement was not very 
great

federal investigators trying to determine 
the cause of a crash that killed 10 people aboard a sightseeing 
plane went today to the hill where the aircraft went down on 
approach to grand canyon airport 
the pilot and copilot were among those killed wednesday when 
the de havilland dhc6 twin otter veered from the runway into the 
wooded hill 300 yards away authorities said eleven people were 
injured eight critically 
tall ponderosa pines sheared off the wings of the grand canyon 
airlines plane but the fuselage remained intact 
we were very fortunate that this didnt burst into flames or 
wed have lost a lot more victims said sheriffs detective lt 
jack judd 
national park service ranger paul crawford said some of the 
passengers were walking around when he arrived 
they were shellshocked they had that empty dazed look 
crawford said 
a team of investigators from the national transportation safety 
board went to the crash site this morning 
a sheriffs deputy removed a video camera from the wreckage but 
it was not known what the tape had captured or even if it had been 
in use while the plane was landing at the airport situated about 
five miles south of the grand canyon 
federal aviation administration records said the plane on feb 
27 lost directional control on landing struck wingtip on runway 
possible nosewheel centering problem the records indicated only 
two crew members were aboard and neither was injured the faa 
records listed wind as a contributing cause and ronald l warren 
grand canyon airlines vice president and general manager said this 
morning he didnt know the final determination of the cause 
he said the plane veered to the right on feb 27 and that it 
went off to the left wednesday on feb 27 the plane was piloted 
by a thennew employee who was being checked out by the pilot 
killed in wednesdays crash warren said 
warren said the plane in wednesdays crash was on its second 
flight of the day and making its final approach to the airport he 
said the plane with 19 passengers and two crew members had a 
onehour 100mile flight over the canyon 
the plane hit the runway bounced back up in the air about 100 
feet then veered to the left and struck a power line and into a 
ridge judd said 
all the passengers were americans warren said the dead 
included john sutton a modesto calif city councilman and his 
wife donna said modesto mayor carol whiteside 
the injured were taken by ambulance airplane and helicopter to 
the flagstaff medical center about 75 miles away eight were 
listed in critical condition the 11th survivor was released from 
the hospital 
warren said when the 14yearold plane reached the airport 
skies were clear winds were light and temperatures normal 
the pilot was in his mid40s and had worked for the airline for 
4 years warren said the copilot was in his mid20s and in his 
first year with the airline 
no cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder was aboard 
because the devices are not manufactured for that type of aircraft 
warren said 
in 1986 a grand canyon airlines plane collided with a 
sightseeing helicopter inside the canyon killing 25 people in 
1983 10 people died when a sightseeing charter plane from las 
vegas smashed into a cliff near the canyons south rim a 
crashinvestigation report said the pilot encountered rough weather 
and could not climb out of the canyon 
in washington ntsb spokesman mike benson said the de havilland 
twin otter has been involved in 77 accidents since 1962 including 
25 that killed a total of 135 people during that period the board 
lists 89 accidents at the grand canyon including 28 that resulted 
in 105 fatalities

the democraticcontrolled senate in a major 
reversal today restored 600 million to president bushs star wars 
program as part of the 288 billion military spending bill 
the senate responded to the pleas of several legislators 
including leading defense figures who said they were worried that 
continuing cuts in the spacebased defense initiative would cause 
irreversible damage to the program 
by a vote of 5347 the senate adopted an amendment requiring 
that 43 billion of the money appropriated for the defense 
department in the fiscal year beginning sunday be spent on star 
wars 
on tuesday the senate had voted overwhelmingly 6634 to spend 
37 billion on star wars formally known as the strategic defense 
initiative and lawmakers indicated that the vote reflected an 
erosion in the support for the program 
but the ranking members of the senate armed services committee 
democrat sam nunn of georgia and john warner of virginia argued 
today that the star wars total approved tuesday had undermined 
their bargaining position in negotiations with the house on the 
defense authorization bill 
the senate in adopting its authorization legislation last 
month approved 45 billion for star wars the houses defense 
blueprint earmarked 31 billion for the program 
we are being confronted by house conferees unwilling to look 
at our number they are instead taking the appropriations number 
nunn a sponsor of the amendment told his colleagues 
he urged his colleagues to send a signal to the house 
conferees that the senate wants a final budget number for star 
wars that is close to the fiscal 1989 total of 41 billion 
failure to restore the funds nunn said would cut out any 
negotiating position we have 
warner another amendment sponsor said the vote would have a 
profound impact on the outcome of the house and senate conference 
on the authorization bill 
but sen bennett johnston dla questioned whether senators 
really believe the house is weakwilled and weakminded and 
wouldnt know whats going on here 
johnston said the proponents of the amendment have asked the 
senate to engage in an exercise in selfdelusion why should 
we have such loyalty to unattainable goals the goals of star 
wars are elusive and vague 
the senate was expected to complete work on the appropriations 
bill today with a handful of amendments on antisatellite weapons 
us troop levels in europe and star wars 
the chamber today approved 955 an amendment allowing the use of 
defense department funds for a multinational antinarcotics strike 
force if such a group is formed a total amount was not specified 
the other aspect of the measure sponsored by sen arlen 
specter rpa was a nonbinding resolution calling on the 
president to allow us involvement in such a strike force the 
antidrug abuse act of 1988 had urged the president to enter into 
negotiations to create a force 
the other amendments pending 
bar funds for antisatellite weapons tests unless the 
administration could certify that the soviets had engaged in tests 
of their own had refused to bargain in good faith in limitations 
and had blocked international verification efforts 
call for either a reduction of 30000 american troops stationed 
in europe or a requirement that us allies foot the bill for those 
personnel if nato and the warsaw pact nations fail to reach a 
conventional arms agreement by oct 1 1990 
require that 820 million of the money for star wars be used 
for research on lasers and particle beams proponents of the 
amendment expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice 
longterm research on directed energy weapons such as lasers and 
particle beams in favor of a quick fix or a phase 1 deployment 
that would favor the socalled brilliant pebbles scheme favored 
by many in the administration 
lawmakers who on wednesday assessed the damage of the senate 
star wars vote provided several explanations for the action 
including the shrinking defense budget the decrease in support and 
recent comments by vice president dan quayle on the program 
it was a straight referendum on this rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed services committee 
said as she pulled an article on quayles comments from her file 
folder 
the vice president who was a strong support of star wars when 
he served in congress a few weeks ago said thenpresident ronald 
reagans sdi astrodome approach to protect the united states 
was political jargon 
members remember his passion for star wars schroeder said 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee discounted the effect of quayles comments as well as 
the recent announcement by the soviet union that it would separate 
star wars from a treaty reducing strategic arms 
some lawmakers had suggested the soviet announcement had 
undercut support for star wars 
its too soon to factor that in the impact of delinking 
aspin said 
aspin said the senate vote doesnt represent a watershed but 
rather support for the program has been eroding watch the vote 
over the years 
kasich said for six years congress had kept sending this money 
somewhere without knowing the results and the enthusiasm has 
diminished the vote kasich hopes will prod the bush 
administration into indicating the future of the program and what 
level of funding it will accept 
the administration has to put a line in the sand on what is 
not acceptable to them i hope this shakes the administration out 
of its unwillingness to confront this issue in a sharp way he 
said 
every year theyre losing more support they dont have any 
program or any plan he said

the death of former philippine president 
ferdinand e marcos today leaves his wife alone to battle charges 
they stole between 168 million and 10 billion from their 
homelands treasury 
a federal indictment charges that 60yearold imelda marcos and 
her husband took 168 million 
but the philippine government accuses the couple in a lawsuit of 
making off with between 35 billion and 10 billion in cash and 
property while his country amassed a large foreign debt 
the money allegedly was spent directly or indirectly on such 
luxuries as prime new york city real estate a 4 million home in 
beverly hills and paintings by artists including picasso van gogh 
and jan bruegel 
as the marcoses fled to the united states on feb 26 1986 the 
customs service impounded more than 7 million in cash valuables 
and jewelry from their plane 
his 20year rule came to a swift end in a public uprising after 
he was accused of stealing an election from corazon aquino now the 
philippine president 
marcos entered a honolulu hospital jan 16 with bronchial 
asthma pneumonia and congestive heart failure he died there this 
morning 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the federal charges her 
husbands ill health kept him from making the trip from hawaii to 
new york for arraignment on racketeering and other charges 
the federal grand jury that indicted the marcoses last october 
also indicted adnan khashoggi 54 the flamboyant saudi financier 
once reputed to be the worlds wealthiest man he was arrested in 
switzerland and extradited to new york 
khashoggi is accused of helping hide riches stolen by the 
marcoses and taking away 25 paintings from new york properties 
owned by the couple and later selling them for 32 million 
although marcos never appeared in court to counter the charges 
directly he commented when reports surfaced in late 1987 that a 
federal investigation was under way into his real estate dealings 
and jewelry acquisitions 
he called the investigation a clear case of pure harassment 
he said he and his wife committed no wrongdoings no violation 
of any law in our conduct in relation to any properties now alleged 
to be illegally obtained by us from anyone 
us prosecutors this year conceded marcos was too ill to stand 
trial and his case was severed from the others but the charges were 
not dropped 
the aquino government sought 50 billion in punitive damages in 
a lawsuit filed in federal court in california against the marcoses 
and an aide ramon azurin 
the marcoses were accused in the lawsuit of bribery extortion 
theft and other charges in a scheme to steal billions of dollars in 
public money to be used for their personal benefit 
the aquino government says it has statements from swiss bank 
authorities that marcos and his family have accounts there worth 
more than 15 billion 
a federal judges order bars the marcoses from using any of 
their assets except to pay their lawyers and for daily living 
expenses mrs marcos has complained that this restriction has left 
her in poverty

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on thursday proposed to act as an intermediary between 
israel and the plo and offered to hold a meeting between them on 
soviet soil 
shevardnadze made the comment to reporters after meeting with 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens both men praised the 
improvement in sovietisraeli relations but said there were no 
immediate plans to resume full diplomatic ties severed by the 
soviets 22 years ago during the 1967 middle east war

occupied territories and a wide range of bilateral issues 
including consular relations and direct air links between moscow 
and tel aviv

urged the soviet union to endorse the israeli peace initiative 
the soviet union does not reject that initiative he said 
and it sees some positive aspects in the initiative i hope we 
will eventually get endorsement from the soviet union 
shevardnadze said i urged foreign minister arens to engage in 
dialogue and direct contact with the plo he added that in the 
soviet view no middle east settlement could succeed without the 
participation of the palestine liberation organization 
i even proposed my good offices to organize such a meeting 
between israel and the plo on the territory of the soviet union 
he said that could be a very good meeting and a sensation for 
reporters he said 
arens had departed and there was no immediate comment from the 
israeli side on the soviet offer however israel refuses to 
negotiate with the plo which it views as a terrorist group 
shevardnadze said the soviet union still hoped for an 
international conference on the middle east and said the five 
permanent members of the us security council the soviet union 
united states china britain and france should be involved in a 
settlement 
israel rejects any conference that would impose a settlement on 
it and calls instead for bilateral talks with its neighbors

with secretary of state james a baker iii and egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdul meguid 
israeli finance minister shimon peres head of the centerleft

mark harmon says an actors goal should be to 
reach a level where you can work with the great people and say 
the great words 
he got the chance to do that he said working opposite 
elizabeth taylor in a television version of tennessee williams 
sweet bird of youth directed by nicolas roeg 
harmon says he made no secret of his admiration for miss taylor 
during filming of the twohour movie which will be broadcast 
sunday on nbc 
im a tremendous fan of hers and i told her that right from 
the beginning he said i think she was having fun too i 
think shes always wanted to play alexandra del lago 
del lago is a fading movie queen who hooks up with harmons 
chance wayne a gigolo run out of his hometown after a sex scandal 
involving a politicians daughter a 1962 film version of the play 
starred paul newman and geraldine page 
harmon 38 says he thinks the play has as much power and 
relevance now as it did 30 years ago 
its a story about time and thats universal and its a 
story about two people who need each other but have to destroy each 
other in order to survive that kind of relationship transcends 
generations 
harmon deliberately seeks parts that play against his cleancut 
good looks to avoid being typecast exclusively in lighter roles 
people in this business love to find a niche for you but i

the pen international writers association met 
thursday with an empty chair for vaclav havel the czech playwright 
whose government barred him from attending 
instead havel sent a message asking for support for all writers 
who face persecution 
havel had been invited to appear on a panel at the session 
titled the writer and the exercise of freedom havels passport 
was confiscated 20 years ago however and his recent application 
for a new one was denied 
jeanguy pilon the quebec writer who led thursdays panel 
referred to the empty chair and said this is a silent testimony 
yet an eloquent testimony to the exercise of freedom by a writer 
he noted that havels work has appeared on the worlds stages 
everywhere but in his native country 
in his message read to the conference havel said if a 
single writer in our country is in chains then there are some 
links of that chain that bind us all 
he referred not to his own legal troubles but to those of three 
other czech writers ivan jirous frantisek starek and petr 
cibulka whom havel said were imprisoned for their writings or for 
publishing others work 
every voice raised in their defense is immensely important 
both to them personally and to us all havel wrote and so 
your public support for these three friends of mine will not just 
be an act of general humanity it will be in the interest of us 
all in the interest of a free and truly authentic literature 
unbound by the agenda of any power 
havel was released from prison may 17 midway through an 
eightmonth jail sentence on charges of incitement and obstructing 
a police officer 
he was charged in january after attending a memorial for jan 
palach a student who set himself on fire and burned to death in 
january 1969 to protest the sovietled invasion a year earlier that 
crushed the a reform movement 
the increasing links between eastern and western writers as a 
result of social and political reforms in the soviet bloc have been 
emphasized at the pen congress 
czechoslovakias leadership however has resisted the reforms 
two delegates from a new soviet chapter based in moscow attended 
the world congress this year for the first time the chapter was 
admitted last may ending a 65year quarrel between moscow and pen 
the international association of poets playwrights editors 
essayists and novelists 
the czech chapter was declared dormant after the 1968 invasion 
but is seeking to be reactivated 
canada is the host of the pen world congress for the first time 
since the association was formed in 1921 the englishspeaking 
canadian chapter organized a twoday session in toronto before the 
conference moved wednesday to montreal for a session sponsored by 
the frenchspeaking chapter 
betty friedan the american author and feminist also was on the 
thursday panel and said threats to freedom of expression can be 
more subtle but still exist in countries such as the united states 
and canada 
i can tell you this from my personal experience as a writer 
and a woman said the author of the feminine mystique a 
classic on womens liberation 
she said writing about women as anything other than the 
acceptable postworld war ii images such as housewife and sex 
object was virtually impossible when her book was published more 
than 25 years ago

black political leaders are blasting 
the city council president and the sheriffs office for using 
arrest warrants and restraints to force three black members to 
return to a meeting for a vote 
arrest warrants handcuffs and bolted doors were used to detain 
warren jones dietra micks and denise lee after they left the 
meeting president tillie fowler ordered them returned so the 
council would have a quorum 
the three council members walked out tuesday after failing to 
get more money for sewage and drainage projects in their districts 
leaving the council without a quorum to adopt the city budget 
state sen arnett girardeau said the council presidents 
decision to issue arrest warrants for the three set jacksonville 
back years in terms of racial relations 
we have witnessed last night a preview of apartheid 
girardeau said at a news conference wednesday 
other black leaders protesting the action were state reps betty 
holzendorf and corrine brown civil service board chairman terry 
fields and the three council members they were joined by several 
black ministers naacp president willye dennis and businessmen 
this act was an embarrassment to the entire jacksonville 
community and showed a void in the leadership of the city 
council ms holzendorf said 
undersheriff raymond miley said the sheriffs office will 
investigate the conduct of the officers who forced the council 
members back to the meeting 
mrs fowler said she thought the three council members acted 
irresponsibly by walking out and almost delaying passage of the 
budget that takes effect oct 1 
she said her actions were not racially motivated and said the 
procedure had been used in the past

the federal aviation administration on 
thursday prohibited any aircraft from flying the remains of 
ferdinand e marcos out of the united states for the philippines 
the emergency regulation was issued after a request from the 
state department which said a plane carrying the former philippine 
presidents remains would create a danger to the safety of the 
aircraft and persons involved 
marcos died early thursday in a honolulu hospital where he had 
been treated for 10 months for a series of ailments marcos who 
died at 72 had come to the united states in february 1986 after an 
election and popular revolt ended his 20year rule and installed 
corazon aquino as president 
mrs aquino in reacting to marcos death reiterated a 
government decision to bar the return of his body in the interest 
of safety of those who will take the death of mr marcos in widely 
and passionately conflicting ways and for the tranquility of the 
state and the order of society 
prior to his death marcos wife imelda vowed to take the 
remains back to his homeland 
faa spokesman john leyden said the agency has a range of fines 
and other actions that can be taken against a pilot or air operator 
who violates regulations the maximum fine is 10000 for airplane 
owners and 1000 for individuals for each instance but a pilot or 
plane operator could also lose their flight certificates depending 
on the circumstances leyden said 
the emergency regulation prohibits flight with marcos remains 
from anywhere in the united states to any point in the philippines 
or to any intermediate destination on a flight whose ultimate 
destination is the philippines 
the regulation remains in effect until oct 1 1990 and could 
be extended the faa said

prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis 
16dayold government has outlined its economic battle plan 
focusing on outofcontrol state finances that have unleashed an 
inflation rate of 50 percent a month 
the governments plan however envisions quickly raising prices 
even higher in order to cut state subsidies on food and thereby 
reduce the government budget deficit 
an adviser to mazowiecki waldemar kuczynski went on television 
wednesday night to appeal for public patience likening the premier 
to a driver who has taken over the steering wheel in the middle of 
a skid 
every driver knows that leading a vehicle out of a skid 
requires a very delicate and difficult maneuver he said 
the governments top economic officials outlined the plan 
wednesday in washington to the international monetary fund they 
plan to submit a final economic program by nov 1 that would let 
poland get a standby credit agreement from the imf by early 1990 
an imf standby agreement in which poland would agree to a 
strict reform program in exchange for new credits is considered a 
prerequisite to any significant new loans from other lenders or 
rescheduling of its crushing 39 billion foreign debt 
i hope that soon we will receive a standby credit said 
wladyslaw baka head of the national bank of poland in an 
interview with the state pap news agency within two or three 
weeks an imf mission will arrive in poland to conclude the talks 
deputy prime minister leszek balcerowicz met with experts from 
the group of seven most industrialized nations and requested a 1 
billion loan to support the zloty while poland introduces a 
realistic exchange rate between the dollar and the zloty 
he also sought an emergency loan of 500 million for imports of 
food medicine and fuel 
according to the outline of the stabilization plan announced 
by balcerowicz and reported in the polish press thursday the 
government plans in the coming months include 
cutting the state budget deficit now estimated at 34 
billion 
limiting borrowing by creating marketbased interest rates 
stopping or lowering most subsidies for production and lifting 
most state price controls 
raising domestic prices for raw materials such as coal and 
lumber to bring them into line with world prices 
limiting the growth of wages in excess of what the economy can 
afford 
in addition under the heading of structural adjustments 
the government plans 
eliminating administrative and fiscal barriers to privatizing 
stateenterprises which account for 93 percent of the 
nonagricultural economy 
privatizing a great number of stateowned institutions 
tightening fiscal discipline of stateowned enterprises 
through reduced credit lower state subsidies and other means 
inflation has climbed alarmingly since the outgoing communist 
government of prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski released 
controls of food prices aug 1 
meat prices alone were up 680 percent in august according to 
one western economic specialist and the respected economic 
newspaper zycie gospardarcze estimated inflation at 50 percent in 
august 
inflation at 50 percent a month is considered the threshhold of 
hyperinflation and would translate into an annual inflation 
rate of more than 600 percent

an air france supersonic concorde jetliner on a 
flight from new york to paris lost a piece of the door covering the 
landing gear as it was approaching charles de gaulle airport in 
paris the company said thursday 
air france said the piece was not a part of the landing gear 
itself but a part of the outer layer of the left landing gear door 
and did not affect landing 
the incident occurred wednesday as the plane was flying at 250 
mph about 3600 feet over the french countryside 
the piece of metal about 40 inches by 30 inches and weighing 11 
to 13 pounds fell into an empty lot in sannois northwest of paris 
a man living in a trailer nearby heard the piece of metal fall 
to the ground he turned it over to police 
air france said the accident was caused by the breaking of a 
connecting rod in the door the company said all such rods were 
being checked by technicians 
earlier this year a concorde which flies at more than twice 
the speed of sound aborted its flight to new york and returned to 
paris after cracks appeared in a porthole the crack was in the 
outermost of four panes of glass in the porthole

a promising new antiaids drug still in the 
early stages of testing will be made widely available while safety 
and effectiveness trials continue the government announced 
thursday 
the plan for expanded distribution of dideoxyinosine or ddi 
marks the first time an unapproved experimental aids drug will 
become so widely available so early in testing 
the epidemic of aids is extraordinary and must be met with 
extraordinary measures said food and drug administration 
commissioner frank young 
health secretary louis sullivan said the plan reaffirms our 
commitment to speeding both the development and the availability of 
promising new drugs for patients with aids whenever possible 
dideoxyinosine has stirred much anticipation and expectation in 
the aids community because early study results have shown it may be 
effective in stopping replication of the aids virus with fewer side 
effects than zidovudine known as azt the only fdaapproved drug 
to combat the aids virus 
under the plan ddi would be available to about 2600 people 
with aids or aids related complex in controlled clinical trials to 
test it headtohead against azt 
the plan will also make ddi available to people with aids or 
advanced aids related complex who cannot take azt and those for 
whom the disease is progressing despite azt and who have no other 
treatment options 
bristolmyers which holds the license to manufacture ddi has 
said it will distribute the drug at no cost under the plan 
neither the company nor the fda would estimate how many people 
with aids might benefit under the plan 
clinical trials will be conducted at 50 sites around the 
country the company said aids patients will have to have been 
rejected for one of the clinical trials before they will be able to 
receive ddi under the other distribution options 
aids activists applauded the action mark harrington of the new 
yorkbased aids coalition to unleash power or actup said this 
is the start of something weve been working for for a long time 
lets use this as a good precedent and build on it 
the plan is the first demonstration of a concept that has been 
under consideration by officials at the public health service an 
hhs division that includes the fda and the national institutes of 
health to make promising aids drugs available to more people 
earlier in the testing process 
they have called the concept parallel track meaning that a 
drug would be made available to people with aids in clinical trials 
as well as to those who cannot participate in the trials 
the first phase of clinical trials during which dosage is 
examined have been completed on ddi by the national cancer 
institute and the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases 
these studies showed that while ddi appears promising it has 
toxicities related to the dose taken thus its use requires 
careful monitoring said an announcement of the plan by the 
department of health and human services 
recent data indicate that some patients taking higher doses of 
ddi have experienced painful nerve damage to the feet and damage to 
the pancreas these side effects appear to be reversible if they 
are detected early and the drug is stopped the department said 
the department also cautioned 
despite the promising early results with ddi it is important 
to emphasize that zidovudine azt is the only drug with proven 
efficacy for the treatment of patients with aids and advanced arc 
aids related complex 
the second phase of clinical trials on ddi is scheduled to begin 
soon under the plan these studies are intended to provide more 
data on whether the drug is safe and effective 
the department also said that while bristolmyers is not 
charging for the cost of the drugs people receiving it are likely 
to incur charges from their doctors and for laboratory costs 
bristolmyers said registration for the clinical trials will 
begin immediately physicians patients and others who want 
information about the trials and other protocols should call a 
tollfree government number 1800trialsa monday through friday 
9 am to 7 pm eastern time 
physicians who want to find out how to enroll patients can call 
bristolmyers tollfree number 18006627999 daily 8 am to 8 
pm eastern time

despite public misgivings by the bush 
administration officials of the international monetary fund on 
thursday predicted ultimate victory in their campaign to 
dramatically increase their lending resources 
delegates from 152 nations concluded the annual meetings of the 
imf and its sister lending organization the world bank without a 
formal agreement on either a doubling of imf resources or a 
substantial increase for world bank lending for the poorest nations 
of the world 
a final agreement on imf resources possibly by the end of the 
year is expected to represent a big boost for japans 
international standing 
resolution of both issues was blocked by objections by the us 
delegation led by treasury secretary nicholas brady who 
maintained that a persuasive case has not yet been made for the 
increases 
despite those objections officials said they had received 
encouragement in private discussions with us officials including 
talks with bush who spoke to the delegates on wednesday 
dutch finance minister h onno ruding who heads the imfs 
policysetting interim committee said he came away from talks with 
bush very pleased that he showed himself to be very aware of the 
issue 
imf managing director michel camdessus has appealed for a 
doubling of imf resources from the current 120 billion to 240 
billion saying the increase is needed for the imf to meet added 
responsibilities in the 1990s 
those challenges include support for the economic reforms under 
way in communist eastern europe and trimming the 13 trillion debt 
burden being carried by the third world 
officials said it was unlikely that camdessus would get a 100 
percent increase in imf resources known as quotas although they 
predicted that a significant boost of between 50 percent and 67 
percent would occur 
camdessus told reporters he had been heartened by the growing 
momentum of support for the quota increase as the week 
progressed he said the three countries still raising objections 
the united states britain and saudi arabia would likely drop 
their opposition so the matter could be resolved by the end of the 
year 
the whole question of boosting imf resources had to be settled 
in conjunction with the ticklish diplomatic issue of how to 
reorder the ranking of the major nations who contribute to the 
fund 
a countrys voting power in the fund is based on its 
contributions to the funds programs japan flush with capital 
because of its huge trade surpluses has been willing to recycle 
some of those funds to help poor nations but only if its power in 
the imf was increased 
under what many delegates believe is a likely outcome japan 
will move from fifth place to second place right behind the united 
states which would maintain the no 1 position with 20 percent of 
the voting shares japan would share second place with west 
germany currently ranked third according to the scenario 
britain which is currently no 2 would drop into a tie for 
fourth with france this shuffling of power would provide west 
germany and in particular japan with stronger voices in the affairs 
of the imf the agency created 44 years ago to prevent the kind of 
economic dislocations which had resulted in two world wars 
world bank president barber conable was optimistic the issue of 
boosting resources for the world bank would soon be settled the 
united states is the lone holdout over the question of providing 
145 billion for three years worth of loans by the indernational 
development association the world bank affiliate which provides 
loans at low interest rates to the worlds poorest nations

president bush and the nations 
governors agreed today on goals for traditionshattering reform 
of troubled american schools including an antidrug campaign 
reducing dropouts and slashing government red tape 
weve reached agreement on the need for national performance 
goals on the need for more flexibility and accountability the 
need for restructuring and choice and the need for more federal 
support for the prekindergarten education process bush said in 
a sunsplashed ceremony ending a twoday education summit at the 
university of virginia 
speaking on the lawn outside the university rotunda the 
president pledged my determination to follow up in every way 
possible on the accord he reached with the governors 
we just cannot let it sit here and end here and i promise you 
that i wont my cabinet wont and my entire administration will 
not he said 
gov booth gardner dwash reflecting a widespread concern 
among the governors said any additional federal aid that becomes 
available will be applied to the issue of early childhood education 
and head start 
the agreement was announced by bush gardner and gov terry 
branstad of iowa chairman of the national governors association 
after the president had outlined his views on the school crisis 
from this day forward let us be an america of tougher 
standards an america of higher goals and a land of bigger 
dreams bush said at a midday convocation with governors 
educators and students at the university of virginia 
the president pledged to loosen federal restrictions on the 
states and urged the governors in turn to relax their regulatory 
hold on local schools 
calling for national goals by which to judge the performance of 
schools and students bush said there must be a new spirit of 
competition between students between teachers and between schools 
a report card for all 
and to get results he said we will need discipline 
structure and goals 
bush added the american people are ready for radical reforms 
we must not disappoint them 
the president called for traditionshattering reform in 
several areas 
he said every student should be literate enough to know not only 
their three rs but why americans died at bunker hill at 
gettysburg and at monte cassino 
bush also urged allowing parents to choose which schools their 
children attend and said there must be new more accurate ways of 
evaluating schools and making educators more accountable for 
classroom performance 
the president said the education system must never settle for 
the minimum in academics or in behavior decades of research bear 
out what the best teachers already know when standards and 
expectations are high everyone does better 
on the sensitive issue of financing reforms bush said 
to those who say that money alone is the answer i say that 
there is no one answer if anything hard experience teaches that 
we are simply not getting our moneys worth in education our focus 
must no longer be on resources it must be on results 
the statement of summit goals drafted at an early morning 
meeting of white house aides and a delegation of leading governors 
included these proposals 
helping all children prepare for school through nutrition 
programs head start care for needy preschoolers and other programs 
aimed at overcoming the effects of poverty 
restructuring the school system to make educators more 
accountable for their pupils classroom performance 
keeping drugs out of schools

democratic governors meanwhile played down the issue of

the government on thursday stripped disgraced 
former president leonid i brezhnev of the nations highest 
military honor saying he did not deserve it 
brezhnev had a fondness for awards and medals and during the 
later years of his life had himself presented with many of the 
countrys highest honors 
one of those was the order of victory only a few have been 
awarded it including the leaders of the soviet and allied forces 
in world war ii 
the decision to take away brezhnevs order of victory from 1978 
was made by the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys 
highest executive body the tass news agency said 
brezhnev was a red army political officer in southern russia and 
the ukraine during the war and made much of his service in a 1978 
book called the small land about the battle for a small group 
of islands in the black sea 
since he died in 1982 brezhnev has been subjected to scathing 
criticism for fostering economic stagnation and an atmosphere of 
cronyism in the soviet communist party and government 
his name has been removed from cities streets and factories 
and a plaque honoring him has been removed from an apartment 
building in moscow where he lived as communist party leader

parliament on thursday condemned 
hungarys participation in the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia and called it illegal 
hungary joined poland as the only soviet bloc governments to 
condemn the invasion in which all pact countries except romania 
took part hungarys communist party previously had condemned the 
aug 2021 1968 invasion 
janos seboek a member of parliament who presented the motion 
said that did not represent the hungarian people to the extent that 
parliament does 
on the basis of the principle of sovereignty and equality of 
nations and heeding the lessons of recent hungarian history 
parliament condemns the decision which illegally sent hungarian 
troops into czechoslovakia and intervened in the affairs of a 
neighboring country the government statement said 
parliament adopted the position with 250 votes in favor and 11 
against 
earlier in the day defense minister ferenc karpati called the 
brezhnev doctrine outdated for good 
the doctrine which allows moscow to intervene militarily if the 
kremlin considers communism in danger in other warsaw pact 
countries was invoked by the late soviet leader leonid brezhnev to 
justify the crushing of the prague spring reforms of alexander 
dubcek 
hungarian leaders eager to assure their citizens there is no 
threat from moscow to the broad political reforms under way in 
hungary have said they have assurances from the kremlin that the 
doctrine was no longer in force 
seboek said that because the doctrine was an ideology and not a 
law it could be invoked against hungary at any time 
it could be used in two ways he said either directly which 
is a genuine danger as long as there are stalinist regimes in the 
neighboring countries or indirectly when the same powers help 
domestic conservatives regain power 
hungarys bilateral agreements with allied countries should be 
reviewed seboek said noting that parliament members do not know 
if our fraternal assistance agreements contain military clauses

the conservative chief of the ukrainian communist 
party lost his position as boss of the soviet unions strongest 
political machine thursday to a progressive protege of president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev sharply criticized the dictatorial style of the ousted 
official vladimir v shcherbitsky who ran the ukraine and its 50 
million people with an iron hand for 17 years 
he was retired in a meeting of ukrainian communists which 
gorbachev attended 
the new ukrainian party boss is vladimir a ivashko who was 
shcherbitskys secondincommand and who three weeks ago used the 
pages of the daily newspaper izvestia to sharply criticize absolute 
commanders unresponsive to the public 
ivashko an economist and engineer was chosen in a competitive 
secret ballot the tass news agency said 
shcherbitsky was expected to lose the ukrainian job after he was 
retired from the soviet unions ruling politburo last week in a 
shakeup that cemented gorbachevs hold on power 
the meeting thursday of the ukrainian communist party central 
committee was highlighted by gorbachevs warning to ukrainian 
communists to stop fighting reform groups and start listening to 
their ideas and complaints 
either we recognize the right of others to independence of 
thought and actions either we lead active work to gain public 
opinion and public sympathies to our side and multiply leading 
forces of perestroika or we turn into a limited organization 
merely claiming a leading role gorbachev said in a speech 
broadcast on national television 
with the exception of gorbachev himself shcherbitsky was last 
member of the politburo picked by the late president leonid 
brezhnev whose rule is now officially termed the period of 
stagnation 
activists in the ukraine blamed the 71yearold shcherbitsky and 
his men for slowing economic and political reform in the nations 
breadbasket and industrial heartland 
activists said he remained in power as long as he did because 
gorbachev did not have the political strength to oust him or 
because gorbachev needed his strongarm tactics to keep ukrainian 
nationalists in line 
in the izvestia article ivashko described himself as a 
stubborn supporter of choosing leaders from below 
this is critically important for after all it is impossible 
to change the system if one absolute commander is simply replaced 
by another he said the system remains the same commanding 
the 56yearold ivashko who was promoted to the no 2 job in 
the ukrainian communist party in december last year is considered 
a supporter and protege of gorbachev 
ivashko became a candidate member of the soviet communists 
central committee in 1986 shortly after gorbachev came to power 
he was promoted to a full voting member in april when 110 mostly 
elderly conservatives were retired 
last winter top communists nominated ivashko as one of the 100 
candidates for 100 uncontested seats reserved for the party in the 
new soviet congress of peoples deputies said a western analyst 
shcherbitsky in contrast was one of the few politburo members 
who had to run in a contested election he chose a safe candidacy 
in his home base in the dnepropetrovsk region after workers in his 
capital of kiev turned him down three times 
ivashko had been demoted out of the secretariat of the ukrainian 
party in 1987 and some western analysts say this occurred shortly 
after a clash between gorbachev and shcherbitsky 
tass said ivashko ran for the first secretary job thursday 
against another ukrainian communist party secretary stanislav 
gurenko the news agency did not report the vote totals but said 
that ivashko received solid support 
in february as the country prepared for its first nationwide 
competitive elections in 70 years gorbachev made a campaignstyle 
trip through the ukraine promoting his reform program known as 
perestroika and upstaging a dourfaced shcherbitsky at each 
stop 
he met with leaders of a fledgling local reform movement that 
has since mushroomed and spoke to workers in the streets 
encouraging them to oust their oldstyle bosses 
ivashko like gorbachev has had some kind words for the 
alternative organizations that have sprung up under perestroika 
but both men criticize demagogues in some of the groups for 
seeking political power 
during gorbachevs february visit ukrainian police permitted 
nightly protest meetings where activists openly called for 
shcherbitskys defeat at the polls 
immediately after gorbachevs departure shcherbitsky cracked 
down again on protesters 
the conservative party boss struggled to maintain surface calm 
with police power but the picture cracked in july when coal miners 
in the donetsk region of the ukraine joined a strike that spread 
nationwide

head start the federal preschool 
program was singled out for praise by governor after governor at 
the education summit but there was no indication they had 
persuaded president bush to provide enough money for all poor 
toddlers to attend 
still supporters of the program could claim at least a bit of 
progress thursdays concluding joint statement by bush and the 
governors said in regard to federal education money we urge that 
priority for any further funding increases be given to prepare 
young children to succeed in school 
bush himself in his speech to the governors made a point of 
noting that his education proposals to congress last spring 
included an increase in funding for head start 
however bushs proposed increase about 250 million for a 
12 billion program falls far short of what many governors and 
educators say is needed 
it is a good program it works but it is not available except 
to about 27 percent of the eligible students complained 
colorado gov roy romer a democrat 
other governors said bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
also indicated to the president during summit working sessions that 
early child programs including head start can be critical in 
terms of ultimate educational success for children who would 
otherwise start school at a disadvantage to kids from welloff 
families 
and a list of goals drafted by white house aides and a 
delegation of leading governors at the summit included helping all 
children prepare for school through nutrition programs head start 
care for needy preschoolers and other programs aimed at overcoming 
the effects of poverty 
but again no talk of full funding 
arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat recalled that during the 
presidential campaign bush said he favored the idea that all 
disadvantaged 4yearolds be covered 
however clinton indicated that governors spending much time 
fighting for funding for head start at the summit would have been 
a very foolish expenditure of our time when we have so much 
more to fight over argue about or work through 
theres a difference of opinions among democrats and a 
difference of opinions among republicans said clinton gov 
carroll campbell a south carolina republican and i would like 
to see our children covered with head start funds but its a 
mistake to think thats the sole subject of the summit 
head start begun as part of president lyndon johnsons war on 
poverty in 1965 serves about 452000 youngsters including 13 
percent handicapped estimates are that there are 24 million 
eligible children 
about 12 billion was spent on the program this year the 
national education association estimates about 63 billion is 
needed to serve all eligible children aged 3 through 5 
certainly head start has been a fine program said education 
secretary lauro cavazos in an interview the problem that were 
getting into is the funding issue again 
all youve got to do is look at the federal budget and its 
clear that theres no room for a lot of new programs and a lot of 
expansion activity he said thats not to say that as a 
department were not going to push early childhood education we 
certainly believe thats a part of it 
head start is administered by the administration on children 
youth and families within the department of health and human 
services not the education department it started as an eightweek 
summer program to help disadvantaged youngsters catch up with 
wealthier children so that they could enter first grade on an equal 
footing 
rules say 80 percent of enrolled children must be from families 
at or below the poverty level 
frequently touted by liberals and conservatives alike the 
program has a proven track record of improving childrens 
performance on school achievement tests helping them learn social 
skills and improving parents attitudes toward their children 
the program also provides medical and nutritional services 
the council on competitiveness said a review of head start 
evaluation studies shows that the program also helps to reduce 
school absenteeism and health problems and lowers the likelihood 
that a student will drop out of the education system 
bushs proposed increase of 250 million would allow an 
additional 90000 children to receive services officials say 
both houses of congress have approved authorization for the 
extra money but in different pieces of legislation

cardinal jozef glemp of poland was 
quoted in an interview published thursday as saying jews 
especially those in the united states dont understand the polish 
people 
the respected sueddeutsche zeitung of munich also quoted the 
controversial polish primate as saying he wants to hold a symposium 
to clear up misunderstandings between jews and poles 
polands roman catholic leaders and jewish organizations have 
been at odds in recent weeks over a carmelite convent outside the 
walls of the former auschwitz nazi concentration camp in poland 
jewish and catholic representatives including polish cardinal 
franciszek macharski agreed in geneva in february 1987 to move the 
17 carmelite nuns from the convent the convent comes under 
macharskis krakow diocese 
jewish groups claim the convent and a 23foot cross at the 
auschwitzbirkenau location are offensive and insensitive an 
estimated 25 million jews were killed at auschwitz during the nazi 
holocaust 
on july 14 an american rabbi and six other jews staged a 
protest at the site because the convent had not been closed as 
agreed the protesters tried to scramble over a convent wall and 
were forcibly ejected by polish laborers 
cardinal macharski announced aug 10 that the agreement to move 
the nuns would be abrogated due to the aggressive atmosphere of 
the controversy 
in a sermon on aug 26 glemp said it was only luck that none 
of the nuns were murdered further angering jewish groups 
he insisted the agreement to move the convent should be 
renegotiated and that the polish church lacked funds to build a 
new facility for the nuns 
but on sept 19 the vatican announced the convent should be 
moved and said it would help finance the relocation 
elan steinberg executive director of the new yorkbased world 
jewish congress hailed the announcement as a breakthrough 
glemp denied in the newspaper interview that his sermon had 
antijewish undertones 
referring to many press comments alleging my antisemitism 
glemp said i counter by saying that this antisemitism does not 
exist in me 
glemp said the jewish protests against the convent offended 
our dignity and that of the nuns 
that is why i had to also protest loudly this protest was 
misunderstood for me it concerned a more open and deeper 
dialogue the newspaper quoted glemp as saying 
glemp who suggested in his sermon that jews stirred up 
antipolish sentiments in the international press said the 
coverage was at times hurtful and showed ignorance of polish 
problems 
i think that after this storm after these very sharp and 
vehement discussions the weaknesses on both sides are clearer 
glemp was quoted as saying when asked how christianjewish 
differences could be resolved 
he said an interfaith symposium should be convened to discuss 
problems 
we want the jews to understand us especially the jews in 
america who talk a lot but do not understand the situation we 
want them to develop a correct respect for the poles the 
newspaper quoted glemp as saying

president bushs 9 million plan to help the 
nicaraguan political opposition in next years election ran into 
trouble thursday at a senate hearing when some lawmakers said it 
was too vague and sen jesse helms accused the administration of 
trying to railroad it through congress 
but bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs urged a senate foreign relations panel to 
approve the transfer of money to help opposition candidate violeta 
chamorro saying this is fundamentally not a fair fight 
in a related development senate intelligence committee chairman 
david boren dokla said he had been assured by bush 
administration officials that there would be no attempt to use the 
cia or other means to influence the elections clandestinely 
ive been given absolute assurance boren said theres 
not a glimmer not a crack not a loophole of any kind 
the overt aid plan calls for giving an additional 5 million to 
the national endowment for democracy a quasigovernmental 
foundation to use for election monitoring voter registration and 
other activities deemed nonpartisan 
another 4 million could go outside ned channels to monitoring 
groups registration and getoutthevote activities 
aronson asked senators to see that the aid is approved quickly 
since voters may register for the feb 25 voting only during 
october 
but sen christopher dodd dconn said it was unlikely money 
could be approved before next week at the earliest and he 
challenged aronson on how the money would be spent 
when aronson began to compare the modest us proposal with 
the billions received by nicaragua from the soviets dodd halted 
him and called it a silly point 
aronson protested that the united states is seeking to build 
from scratch an electoral mechanism in a country which never has 
had free elections educate people about the process and give 
them some sense that they can vote safely 
the question is whether its well thought out dodd said 
there is no question we ought to be involved the question is 
whether were doing it intelligently 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan echoed those concerns there is 
a lot of money going out in our fervent desire to see a strong 
election and hopefully the success of mrs chamorro we have to be 
cautious about how that money is being spent she said 
ned director carl gershman conceded that this dwarfs what the 
endowment itself has been able to spend in any other situation 
including larger countries like the philippines panama and chile 
the hearing was cut short because of a republican procedural 
objection and helms rnc entered the room only long enough to 
complain that the session had been scheduled without any advance 
notice to senate republicans 
the minority was not consulted and i resent it he said 
when chairman claiborne pell dri said the session had been 
arranged with the republican administration helms replied 
you thought you were going to snooker us 
i fundamentally object to this thing being railroaded as it 
is helms said outside the hearing if they want to play games 
like that i know how to play them as well 
helms stated objections to the package include a philosophical 
opposition to us involvement in overseas elections disapproval 
of the opposition coalition which includes communists and 
socialists and the necessity of paying some of the money in the 
form of a tax to the sandinistacontrolled supreme electoral 
council

rare wine from a danish castle cellar that was 
hidden from the invading germans in world war ii sold for 162000 
on thursday the auctioneers christies said 
all of the nearly 3000 bottles of wine most of them french 
were sold by the owner of the 1100yearold aalholm castle near 
nysted in southern denmark the chief buyers were two collectors a 
belgian and a norwegian the londonbased auction house said 
michael broadbent head of christies wine department said the 
germans who invaded denmark in 1940 visited the castle but never 
found the wine cellar 
the family were afraid that the germans would drink all their 
wine so the entrance door was bricked up and there appeared to be 
nothing behind the wall he said 
a secret entrance was made by digging a hole through the 
kitchen floor next to the stove and constructing a shaft covered 
with a trapdoor concealed under a basket of logs 
many of the wines had been undisturbed for decades after being 
shipped to the castle in casks and bottled in the cellar by the 
butler 
the owner baron johanotto rabenlevetzau does not entertain 
on the scale of his forebears and as the stock of older wines is 
too large to be consumed by his family and he needs more space he 
decided to thin out the older vintages dating from the late 19th 
century broadbent said

the bush administration expects to reach its 
deadline of having a new steel import restraint program with 29 
nations in place by sunday a top trade official said thursday 
there will be a steel program as of oct 1 deputy us 
trade representative linn williams told a conference of steel 
manufacturers as the bush administration was completing hurried 
negotiations on the program 
we may have some cleanup to do after sept 30 but we will 
have a new program oct 1 williams said 
the program will replace a series of fiveyear reagan 
administration steel trade pacts that expire saturday 
negotiators in the office of us trade representative carla 
hills have been meeting this week to finalize pacts with the 
european community and other leading steelexporting nations 
including japan south korea and mexico 
now it is up to congress to pass legislation implementing the 
program a bill containing president bushs proposal to extend the 
pacts passed the house ways and means committee wednesday but has 
yet to be considered by the full house or the senate 
congress needs to get a new program enacted as soon as 
possible to prevent steelexporting countries from taking advantage 
of the situation said rep nancy johnson rconn a sponsor of 
the bill we dont want to send the world a signal that it is 
alright to begin dumping steel in the us again 
she said the sponsors have adopted an informal noamendment 
rule because if we start to tinker with it again the whole thing 
could unravel 
the reagan program lasted five years but the scaleddown bush 
version only lasts 2 years 
us trade negotiators had a difficult time in 1984 getting some 
steelexporting nations to agree to annual productbyproduct 
ceilings on the volume of steel to be shipped to the united states 
those negotiations took six months but williams said pact 
renewals could be signed by sunday even though trade 
representatives were given only 45 days this time around 
there is no country with which we are dealing that i am not 
convinced will enter into a voluntary restraint agreement and a 
consensus agreement on time williams said 
in the consensus agreements nations are being asked by the bush 
administration to commit to steps designed to remove government 
subsidies or other barriers to free steel trade 
steel labor is backing the bush program but has doubts about 
whether a meaningful consensus on free trade can be achieved 
we have many reservations about whether thats possible 
united steelworkers president lynn williams said in an interview 
thursday he is not related to his bush administration namesake 
the steelworkers had pushed for an extension of five years not 
2 of the productbyproduct pacts but the union leader said 
we dont want to undercut the presidents program well wait and 
see how it plays out

two people were sentenced to life in prison and 
three others to jail terms of five years to 12 years for 
hooliganism during rioting in the chinese city of xian this 
spring an official report said 
also thursday china said a french reporters story of the 
arrest and abuse of a student which he told at a news conference 
by chinas top leaders was an appalling lie and violated 
journalistic ethics 
the life sentences were given to liu gang and sun guanghu for 
allegedly leading others to attack stores and the railroad station 
during april riots said the report in wednesdays edition of the 
legal daily 
three other people were given jail terms of five years to 12 
years the newspaper did not say when the sentencing took place or 
give any details about the defendants 
liu gang also is the name of a student on chinas list of 
mostwanted leaders of the spring prodemocracy movement the liu 
gang mentioned in the legal daily report is not believed to be the 
same person 
the provincial foreign affairs office contacted by telephone 
said it did not know whether the court sentenced the student leader 
or another man with the same name the court refused comment 
the xian violence erupted shortly after a memorial ceremony for 
ousted communist party chief hu yaobang whose april 15 death 
triggered massive student demonstrations 
the newspaper said the five who were sentenced hurled stones and 
bricks at buses and other vehicles during rioting 
sun blowing on a whistle led a group that attacked the train 
station while liu incited others to destroy the liberation road 
department store and 13 other private shops the report said 
in beijing thousands of people including many students were 
arrested after troops crushed the sevenweek democracy movement on 
june 34 chinese sources say some have been beaten in prison 
international rights groups such as amnesty international have 
appealed to china to release them as prisoners of conscience and 
say some may have been tortured and executed secretly 
the official peoples daily party newspaper thursday quoted 
beijing and sichuan authorities as denying the story of french 
reporter eric meyer of les dernieres nouvelles dalsace 
at a tuesday news conference meyer said he knew of a chinese 
woman student wounded june 3 in the army attack arrested and sent 
to work in a brick factory in southwestern chinas sichuan 
province where she was raped three times by peasants 
we feel strongly indignant at this french reporter for he 
dared to brazenly tell such a fabricated story before some 300 
chinese and foreign reporters in violation of the basic principle 
of journalism that news reporting must be factual the paper 
quoted beijings deputy police director wang dingfeng as saying 
it quoted zheng wenju sichuan justice department director as 
expressing his deep regret over the french reporter spreading 
such an appalling lie 
meyer said thursday he stands by the story but refused to say 
how he learned of it

sir shridath ramphal secretarygeneral of the 
48nation british commonwealth said thursday that a delegation 
from australia canada and india is lobbying international banks to 
cut off loans to south africa 
in another development former australian prime minister malcolm 
fraser said commonwealth leaders have indicated he is the leading 
candidate to succeed ramphal in june ahead of nigerian chief emeka 
anyaoku 
this conflicted with reports by commonwealth secretariat sources 
that anyaoku is virtually certain to get the job 
on south africa ramphal said the commonwealth will continue to 
press for tough embargoes but he indicated it will not try at its 
biennial summit meeting in malaysia next month to impose new 
measures thus avoiding a dispute with britain 
the commonwealth britain apart will continue to use the 
pressure of sanctions to persuade south africa to end apartheid 
and to mobilize wider international support to this end said 
ramphal 
british prime minister margaret thatcher is the sole leader in 
the mainly african asian and caribbean association of britain and 
its former colonies who publicly opposes tough measures against 
south africa a major trading partner of britain 
she says sanctions would hurt blacks most invite cheating and 
harden white south african resistance to change 
addressing a luncheon given by commonwealth journalists ramphal 
added i dont think the time is ripe for the introduction of a 
new package of sanctions but for sending a clear message that they 
can be expected if there is no evidence of clear progress 
instead ramphal said the commonwealth is concentrating on 
getting banks to refuse to reschedule south africas foreign debt 
south africas repayment agreement on 8 billion of foreign debt 
expires next june and government and banking officials are battling 
for new agreements 
at a news conference at the australian high commission fraser 
said a hardheaded and unsentimental count by australian 
missions and another major supporter put him ahead in the contest 
for ramphals job 
answering a question he said canada backed him but declined to 
identify other supporters 
he added he had significant support in africa a number of 
african countries have told me they want to make a decision on the 
man not on a regional basis said fraser 
commonwealth leaders are to decide on the new secretarygeneral 
during their meeting in malaysia 
anyaoku is a deputy to ramphal a guyanese who has held the job 
for 15 years 
commonwealth secretariat sources who requested anonymity 
maintain anyaoku who would be the first african commonwealth 
secretarygeneral has a strong lead including backing from almost 
all african and caribbean members

tens of thousands of angry serbs 
rallied on thursday to denounce the slovenian republics adoption 
of major changes in its regional constitution including the right 
to secede 
the yugoslav parliament asked the supreme court thursday to rule 
urgently on whether the amendments were allowed under the federal 
constitution 
the changes adopted by the slovenian parliament on wednesday 
give that small northern state the right to secede from the 
sixrepublic federation and to control use of the yugoslav military 
in slovenia in peacetime 
in the southern republic of serbia at least 10000 people 
rallied in novi sad 50 miles north of belgrade to hear speakers 
describe slovenias action as a lunatic act of hatred and 
high treason 
the integrity of this country will be defended by armed force 
if necessary one speaker told a cheering crowd 
the gathering was broadcast live by state television 
an additional 15000 serbs protested in the town of leskovac 
and hundreds of other rallies were held elsewhere throughout 
serbia the official tanjug news agency said 
the meetings were organized by supporters of the serbian 
communist leadership which advocates more central control in the 
country 
the amendments in slovenia pave the way for introduction of a 
westernstyle multiparty democracy in the state where independent 
opposition parties have already been formed slovenia borders on 
italy and austria 
the federal constitutions preamble also stipulates the right to 
selfdetermination and the right of individual republics to secede 
without specifying how this could be achieved 
slovenian authorities have stressed they do not intend to secede 
and that the changes only provide an added sense of security 
for the 2 million slovenes who make up about 8 percent of 
yugoslavias population 
joze smole head of the communistled socialist alliance of 
slovenia told the belgrade daily borba not a single slovene 
wishes the republic to secede from yugoslavia 
up to 50000 people demonstrated on wednesday in the southern 
republic of montenegro demanding the slovenian leadership be 
toppled 
the protests appeared similar to those preceding imposition of a 
state of emergency last february in serbias kosovo province where 
ethnic albanians make up 85 percent of the population 
that measure was immediately followed by a constitutional change 
limiting kosovos autonomy and giving serbia a greater say in its 
affairs subsequent ethnic albanian riots left 24 people dead 
the slovenian delo daily said thursday that to opponents we 
can only say we are yugoslavs but we are slovenes first and 
the constitutional changes reflect our national interests 
yugoslavia has a decentralized system of government and 
collective federal presidency fashioned in 1974 to keep one 
republic from gaining sway over the others but resulting in an 
ineffective government by compromise

bush administration officials 
apologized for federal drug policy coordinator william bennetts 
dismissive assessment of governors remarks at the education 
summit gov terry branstad said thursday 
a number of administration people expressed regret that the 
secretary was somewhat flip in his remarks said branstad 
republican governor of iowa 
i think mr bennett went overboard with some of his statements 
and that was the general consensus among both the administration 
people and the governors he said he didnt name any officials 
bennett who headed the education department during the reagan 
administration was moderator wednesday of a closed session on 
the learning environment with a number of governors later he 
joined several governors in publicly summing up what had been 
discussed 
there was pap standard democratic pap there was standard 
republican pap and there was stuff that rhymes with pap on both 
sides too he said 
bennett added much of the discussion took place in total 
absence of any knowledge of what works or whats effective in the 
actual experience of school some people were saying things 
that other people had written for them and they were reading them 
out of books and reading them off cards

police mediated a truce between armed 
residents of a drugridden neighborhood and alleged crack cocaine 
dealers after simmering tensions erupted into a crossstreet 
gunbattle officers said thursday 
the truce in which neighbors agreed to put firearms away and 
drug dealers agreed to keep dealing off the street has brought a 
measure of calm to the nervous hilltop neighborhood 
police said the two sides exchanged 300 shots saturday during an 
antidrug block party at the home of army ranger staff sgt bill 
foulk who summoned 11 offduty rangers as reinforcements 
no one was injured however until the next day when fistfights 
broke out and some neighbors suffered scrapes and bruises from 
thrown bricks only two arrests were made saturday both of alleged 
gang members although the rangers weapons were confiscated 
patrol officer lee giles who helped arrange the meeting 
wednesday that led to the truce said the alleged drug dealers 
agreed that selling of drugs on the street or in the area was 
unacceptable and would stop 
for their part foulk and his neighbors agreed not to use 
weapons 
i dont want to say were friends yet but its a start 
foulk said 
we wont be in the open selling drugs said robert brown 
who negotiated with foulk and his neighbors on behalf of the youths 
and alleged drug dealers on the block 
telephone numbers were exchanged and both parties said they 
would try to talk out any disagreements giles said 
all the people involved felt it was better to talk than 
shoot said police sgt steve smith another mediator 
foulks and neighbor john harper said their key concession was to 
realize that neighbors cannot stop drug dealing entirely 
all we can hope to do is get the drug dealing off the street 
the violence associated with it so we can start to feel safe 
foulk said 
police participation does not mean they are sanctioning drug 
sales on or off the street giles said 
were not so naive as to say were going to stop all drug 
sales he said lets be real but at least were giving them 
the message we will not condone that 
were still going to go after them as aggressively as we 
can added police spokesman mark mann if they think were 
going to back off because theyve moved inside theyre wrong 
foulk 32 and his fellow negotiators said a key to the 
agreement will be browns ability to convince his side to abide by 
the terms 
brown 28 said the residents made it plain and clear they 
were going to keep on fighting if the dealers did not leave the 
street 
mayor doug sutherland said the terms of the agreement are 
certainly different but praised the unusual pact 
fort lewis officials where the rangers are stationed said they 
would not take action against their personnel involved and leave 
the matter to local authorities

israel outlawed the radical islamic 
fundamentalist movement hamas on thursday and announced it will 
bar the 700000 palestinians in the gaza strip from entering israel 
during the jewish new year holiday 
troops shot and killed a palestinian in the west bank town of 
nablus during a stonethrowing confrontation and wounded 17 others 
in clashes in the gaza strip arab reports said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
the death of bilal einab 20 brought to 575 the number of arabs 
killed by israeli troops or civilians since the start of the 
palestinian uprising in december 1987 an additional 121 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel forty israelis have died 
also thursday defense minister yitzhak rabin picked up a key 
endorsement amid growing signs he may be able to unseat finance 
minister shimon peres as leader of the leftleaning labor party 
rabin 67 who was prime minister from 197477 won backing from 
labor party doves ely benmenachem and ezer weizman the science 
minister 
the leadership issue is unlikely to come to a head unless 
labors coalition with the rightwing likud bloc breaks apart 
likely only with serious movement toward israelipalestinian 
negotiations 
hamas emerged soon after the start of the revolt spreading its 
influence from gaza to parts of the west bank the movement 
advocates an islamic state including the occupied lands and israel 
this movement has a religious character is very radical and 
is using very cruel means it pledged violent struggle not only 
against israel but also against judaism and zionism said shmuel 
goren israels coordinator for the occupied territories 
the army announced a threeday closure of the gaza strip from 
friday through monday during rosh hashana the new year holiday 
security throughout the country will be reinforced over the weekend 
also thursday palestinian activist faisal husseini warned the 
uprising will intensify if peace efforts fail but he rejected the 
idea of armed struggle 
husseini and three other prominent palestinians speaking on a 
panel also said the 10point egyptian peace plan aimed at ending 
the impasse over israels peace initiative does not go far enough 
in pressing for palestinian independence 
we are ready to deal with any proposal we are ready to start 
any negotiations if we will be addressed as a people not as a 
minority or as refugees or as inhabitants of a certain place he 
said 
husseini a proplo activist told the forum sponsored by the 
foreign press association that if peace efforts fail we will 
escalate our struggle we will cover more areas cover more 
people 
but we will not be provoked the israelis will not push us to

here are excerpts from president 
bushs speech to the nations governors thursday the final day of 
their education summit at the university of virginia 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its easy to keep your perspective and be humble at a school so 
rich in history and in educational endeavor and ive also been 
deeply impressed by the commitment the creativity and the 
knowledge that my fellow chief executives bring here to this 
education reform agenda 
in our meetings yesterday i learned exactly how much you care 
about the children of your states and the future and in short i 
came to charlottesville with high expectations and ive got to say 
you have exceeded them 
so the spirit of our summit is not who will get the credit the 
spirit of this summit is how can we get results were here to put 
progress before partisanship the future before the moment and our 
children before ourselves 
ive heard eloquent advice from many of you and from so many 
others in the last few weeks and ive listened and i am deeply 
appreciative of all that i have learned but ive also learned that 
we should listen to our children and they have much to tell us 
in many ways they are the luckiest generation in history just 
last month our children observed in the clarity of voyagers 
sight the horizons of new worlds the majesty of space and think 
what these images would have meant to the ever curious founder of 
this university who could only look through a primitive telescope 
at faint patches of light and wonder 
but our children are growing up in an age where wonder is 
commonplace peace and prosperity often taken for granted and our 
children are also the beneficiaries of a nation that lavishes 
unsurpassed resources on their schooling so in many ways were 
close to fulfilling the enlightenment dream of universal education 
a dream that became a reality in the shadows of the shenandoahs 
here at mr jeffersons school 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
so let us make this an education society weve already come 
close to this jeffersonian ideal our educational system is in 
many ways unrivaled in its scale and its diversity and its 
commitment to meeting special needs and individual differences and 
were inspired by our best teachers who give more than we can 
rightly expect and from our best students who surpass our highest 
expectations 
and yet after two centuries of progress we are stagnant while 
millions of americans read for pleasure millions of others dont 
read at all and while millions go to college millions may never 
graduate from high school the national assessment of educational 
progress estimates that fewer than one in four of our high school 
juniors can write an adequate persuasive letter and only half can 
manage decimals fractions and percentages and barely one in 
three can locate the civil war in the correct half century 
no modern nation can long afford to allow so many of its sons 
and daughters to emerge into adulthood ignorant and unskilled the 
status quo is a guarantee of mediocrity social decay and national 
decline education is our most enduring legacy vital to everything 
that we are and can become and come the next century just ten 
years away what will we be will we be the children of 
enlightenment or its orphans 
six years ago the committee on excellence in education issued 
its powerful report and yet today our nation is still at risk 
the educational reform movement has done well in articulating its 
criticisms and now it is time to define goals this is the time 
for action 
i sent my proposals for federal action in education to congress 
last spring including an increase in funding for head start the 
educational excellence act of 1989 includes ways to reshape and 
expand federal efforts to recognize excellence lift the needy 
foster flexibility and choice and measure and reward progress 
i remain solidly committed to these principles and i value your 
advice and ideas as we continue to refine the federal role some 
offer a completely different answer spend more money alone and 
at the federal level we have asked congress to provide nearly half 
a billion dollars in new funding for ten worthy programs 
your states may also choose to spend more but to those who say 
that money alone is the answer i say that there is no one answer 
if anything hard experience teaches that we are simply not getting 
our moneys worth in education our focus must no longer be on 
resources it must be on results 
and this is only the third time in our 200 years as a nation 
that a president has called a summit with the governors and ive 
called you together because you bear the constitutional 
responsibility for education and i didnt ask you to such an 
historic occasion merely to bemoan what is wrong we are here to 
work and work together to once again make an american education 
the best in the world 
and let me say to the governors before this majestic audience 
these sessions have been informative and thoughtful and very 
useful to me and i appreciate the obvious extensive preparations 
that the governors have undertaken in the days and weeks leading up 
to this summit 
the governors have emphasized to me the need for national 
performance goals and the importance of greater flexibility in the 
use of federal funds while accepting enhanced accountability for 
the results and theyve also stressed the high priority that 
helping prepare preschool children should have in federal spending 
even in time of fiscal constraint 
and finally the governors have articulated eloquently the need 
to restructure our education system you already are consulting 
with state legislators to better our schools our teachers already 
are giving their heart and soul to their jobs but weve never 
before worked together president and principal governor and 
teacher to achieve results in education 
a social compact begins today in charlottesville va a compact 
between parents teachers principals superintendents state 
legislators governors and the administration our compact is 
founded not on promises but on challenges each one a radical 
departure from tradition i hope that you will join me to define 
national goals in education for the first time from this day 
forward let us be an america of tougher standards of higher 
goals and a land of bigger dreams

us jewish organizations on thursday 
protested the granting of visas to three palestine liberation 
organization leaders to attend the un general assembly this year 
the three plo representatives who have received visas are 
among the most radical members of the plo leadership said a 
statement from the conference of presidents of major american 
jewish organizations 
their record of terrorist activity and rejectionist statements 
makes clear that they come not in the cause of peace but of 
propaganda the statement said 
the visas granted by the state department were announced 
wednesday and diplomats said they expected plo chairman yasser 
arafat also to apply for a visa the approval of visas for arafats 
lieutenants they said increases the likelihood that arafat will 
be allowed to visit 
after he was denied a visa last year the 159nation general 
assembly in protest moved to geneva for a special session to hear 
arafat from that podium he announced the renunciation of terrorism 
and recognition of israels right to exist demands made by the 
united states 
on thursday however the jewish organizations said his 
representatives farouk kaddoumi yasser abed rabbu and sulim 
najib have been involved in terrorist acts and called for the 
destruction of israel 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference said these are 
not the words or deeds of peacemakers but rather of violent men 
that they should have been chosen to represent the plo confirms 
once more that the plo remains committed to its stated goal of 
purging israel from the region 
the conference is an umbrella group representing such 
organizations as hadassah bnai brith the american jewish 
congress 
the statement of protest was sent to the state department

southern democrats provided the margin of 
victory thursday as the house rejected an effort by its democratic 
leaders to derail a capital gains tax cut 
southerners accounted for 42 of the 64 democrats who joined with 
a nearly solid bloc of republicans in a 239190 vote to defeat the 
leadership plan to replace the capital gains tax cut with expanded 
deductions for individual retirement accounts financed by higher 
taxes on the wealthy 
the winning coalition was similar to the one that enacted many 
of former president reagans economic programs but southerners who 
supported president bush in the capital gains fight were quick to 
reject the boll weevil label that was applied to southern democrats 
who backed reagan eight years ago 
im not even a member of the boll weevils said rep ed 
jenkins dga one of the authors of the capital gains tax cut in 
the house ways and means committee youd have to call me a 
liberal boll weevil 
jenkins said the capital gains reduction had broad support among 
both conservative and moderate democrats and the leadership 
alternative failed because it didnt address that issue 
there are a large number of democrats who simply are not going 
to vote for a tax increase he said and the alternative had 
nothing to do with capital gains that was the real weakness of 
their proposal 
rep ronnie flippo dala another sponsor of the capital gains 
proposal said moderate and conservative democrats supported it as 
a progrowth projobs issue even though it put them at odds 
with party leaders and aligned them with bush who had promised 
such a tax cut during his campaign 
we did it because we thought it was the right policy and 
because we thought the leadership was going in the wrong 
direction flippo said were going to continue to do 
everything we can to see that the democratic party at least 
considers a more conservative viewpoint 
rep ben jones dga said the leadership made a mistake in 
trying to portray the capital gains issue as a tax break for the 
wealthy 
this was a main street issue he said the people ive 
been hearing from on this are not the country club people theyre 
the barber shop people the leadership misjudged it 
voting for the capital gains reduction were eight of the nine 
democrats from georgia four of five from alabama three of four 
from louisiana three of four from mississippi all four from 
kentucky three of four from south carolina both from arkansas 
and half of the 18 from texas 
southern support for the leadership position was concentrated in 
north carolina and florida where seven of eight democrats in each 
state opposed the tax cut in virginia where three of five opposed 
it and in tennessee where four of six opposed it 
jones said many of the southern democrats who voted for the 
capital gains reduction represent districts dominated by small 
farmers timber interests and people with a little bit of real 
estate 
these are the very people weve been losing in presidential 
elections he said were an inclusive party why not include 
some successful people

three citizens groups claiming a potential 
disaster in the making over florida filed suit thursday to 
prevent the launch of a nuclearpowered probe on the space shuttle 
next month 
the suit filed in us district court contends an accident 
during the launch of the nuclearpowered galileo space probe could 
spread poisonous plutonium over a heavily populated area of florida 
theres a potential disaster in the making over florida 
jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends said 
at a news conference we are determined that that will not take 
place 
bruce gagnon of the florida coalition for peace and justice said 
that if the lawsuit is not successful his organization plans to 
put people into the launch area to sit on top of the launch pad in 
an effort to stop the launch 
the other group filing the suit was the christic institute 
nasa plans to send galileo into space aboard the space shuttle 
atlantis on oct 12 once in orbit galileo is to rocket itself on 
a roundabout voyage to jupiter the probe is to circle venus once 
and the earth twice before streaking away from the sun toward 
jupiter 
powering the craft are two radioisotope thermoelectric 
generators each of the rtgs are energized by 247 pounds of 
plutonium238 the radioactive decay of the nuclear material 
produces heat which is converted to electricity 
the lawsuit calls plutonium a deadly carcinogen it said the 
galileo project will condemn thousands of eastern florida residents 
to a wholly unnecessary and virtual certainty of contracting 
cancer if a shuttle launch accident similar to the one that 
destroyed challenger in 1986 caused the plutonium to be vaporized 
and spread over the area 
a press release from rifkins group claimed that nasa has said 
there was a 1in430 chance of radioactive contamination from a 
shuttle accident and that a release of plutonium could cause 
thousands of fatal cancers 
in a statement nasa spokesman dave garrett said the groups 
news release contains several glaring inaccuracies 
the fact is that the highest probability of launch area 
release of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 
1in2500 the nasa statement said it also said such a release 
would have no appreciable adverse health effects on the population 
the suit claims that nasa did not comply with all provisions of 
the national evironmental policy act in compiling an environmental 
impact statement on the galileo launch it asks the court to block 
the launch until the agency has prepared a final environmental 
impact statement for the project that fully complies with the law 
garrett said nasa has not seen copies of the lawsuit but the 
space agencys statement notes the approval to launch the 
galileo spacecraft followed lengthly evaluations of the risk the 
results of which are on the public record the processes were 
followed to the letter we are confident that the mission will be 
carried out without incident 
the suit asks for temporary preliminary and permanent 
injunctive relief in stopping the launch and rifkin said expects 
quick action from us district court judge oliver gasch 
rifkin said the groups hope to delay the launch by at least 18 
months this he said would give nasa time to investigate 
alternate means of launching galileo such as with an unmanned 
rocket from a remote site or to find other ways of powering the 
craft 
lanny sinkin of the christic institute said that putting 
plutonium on galileo was part of a process by the government and by 
industry to put nuclear fuel into space he said the lawsuit will 
force nasa to find means to power deepspace probes other than the 
use of nuclear material 
garrett said that the nuclear rtgs were the only things that 
made any sense in powering galileo

democratic and republican governors 
alike hailed plans mapped out thursday at the education summit to 
cut federal red tape and rejuvenate americas schools but a few 
grumbled that the gathering largely ducked the issue of federal 
money 
several including california gov george deukmejian and new 
jersey gov thomas kean both republicans said the education 
establishment might fight to keep the status quo and resist many 
of the changes discussed at the twoday summit between president 
bush and the nations governors 
bushs address thursday in which he promised to ask congress to 
loosen the grip of federal restrictions was praised as one 
of the best speeches ive ever heard him deliver by new york 
democratic gov mario m cuomo 
florida gov bob martinez said the summit marked a radical 
change in how educational problems are viewed 
its a change from measuring education by how much we spend to 
what were getting for how much weve invested said martinez a 
republican 
everyone felt that the presidents message was wellcrafted 
and welldelivered and it set the right tone said deukmejian 
he predicted there would be no difficulty in drafting concrete 
national education goals by the february meeting of the national 
governors association 
the difficulty he said is that many people in the 
education community resist change they like the status quo the 
difficulty is going to be that there is going to have to be some 
restructuring some accountability some redirecting of funds to 
meet the primary objectives 
it cannot be business as usual he said 
even with cooperation from educators he predicted it would take 
10 years to achieve the reform aims outlined at the summit 
they were saying look mr president if this is so 
important if education is such a national policy at least dont 
reduce what the federal government is doing in funding 
deukmejian said 
tennessee gov ned ray mcwherter a democrat said governors 
were generally pleased at the prospect that the summit might lead 
to eliminating needless federal rules that made certain educational 
programs inflexible 
i believe you can trust local people to run the education 
system he said 
ohio gov richard celeste also a democrat said the jury was 
still out on whether bush had earned the title education 
president and said the administration had painted itself in a 
corner by foreclosing the possibility of steppedup federal 
funding for schools 
the president would have been better served if somebody had 
said look mr president we can do without these three stealth 
bombers and we put them in your pocket and you come in and at an 
appropriate moment you identify where you think in 1990 a new 
federal investment can galvanize this reform agenda 
democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas said i want to thank 
president bush for giving us the chance for the governors after 
seven hard years of work on education reform to have a real 
national partnership in education 
gov william oneill of connecticut also a democrat said it 
was a first it was important the problem has been recognized 
kean of new jersey said im reinvigorated this is really 
exciting this idea that the president of the united states is 
going to lead the way toward a restructuring of the schools which 
is vital and very difficult to do 
but he warned that fundamental change would be resisted by some 
educators 
if the people involved in education oppose and stand in the 
way it will be difficult and time consuming to get any of these 
things accomplished weve got to now bring along the people in the 
system there is still a great body within the education profession 
who say its certainly fine in my school its certainly fine in 
my classroom 
for those of us who believe that everything is not fine 
thats an attitude thats got to be changed he said

congress on thursday approved 11 billion in 
emergency aid for the victims of hurricane hugo capitol hills 
largest disasterrelief package ever the white house said 
president bush will sign the legislation perhaps when he visits 
south carolina on friday 
there never was this much money said bill mcada a 
spokesman for the federal emergency management agency but this 
also may well be the most damaging one hurricane in history 
the aid was attached to a stopgap spending resolution intended 
to keep government agencies operating when the new fiscal year 
begins sunday the spending measure passed the senate on a 100 to 0 
and cleared the house by voice vote 
i have never seen so much damage in my life sen strom 
thurmond rsc told his colleagues before the vote it looked 
there had been a war there we need all the help we can get 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush would fly to south carolina friday to get a firsthand look at 
the devastation left in the wake of hugos passing a week ago and 
may sign the legislation while he is there 
fitzwater said the president wanted to make sure that all that 
can be done is being done and to assure the people of south 
carolina that gov carroll campbell will provide whatever help we 
can 
sen ernest hollings dsc had said wednesday that damage in 
his state was closer to 3 billion to 4 billion but that getting 
that amount would be impossible without forcing acrosstheboard 
federal budget cuts 
mcada said the aid cannot go for home or business repairs to 
people who have insurance but he did say that the assistance 
provides for loans of up to 10000 for people who have needs and 
cannot qualify for private loans for some reason or other 
fitzwater defended the emergency relief agency against 
accusations by hollings that help was being help up in red tape 
the presidential spokesman said that hollings job is to keep 
the pressure on and said government agents were fighting 
remarkable odds in the relief effort 
we think things are going pretty well he said asked if 
bush might help cut red tape that is hindering the cleanup 
fitzwater said if there is any yes well take a look at 
that 
in south carolina campbell said people planning bushs trip 
friday were trying to arrange for the president to see devastated 
areas on the coast as well as inland possible stops include myrtle 
beach charleston and sumter

democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
insisting his party still must get tough with the president said 
thursday he was disappointed with the number of house democrats 
who sided with president bush on his proposal to cut capital gains 
taxes 
but brown who had called the bush proposal a tax giveaway to 
the ultra rich said the house defectors from their party 
leadership are certainly good democrats they are certainly 
democrats we are proud to have as members of our party 
forty six democrats sided with the president on the capital 
gains vote which occurred while the democratic national committee 
was meeting across town and hearing brown excoriate bush for a lack 
of leadership and a continuation of the ethic of greed 
after the house vote brown said i think its very important 
that we draw the line that we make the distinctions that we make 
choices 
in his speech to the dnc brown called on bush to begin 
matching his actions to his charming words 
brown attacked the bush antidrug program as big words 
followed by limited action they declared war and decided 
somebody else is going to have to find the bullets 
some of his harshest rhetoric was directed at the plan to cut 
tax rates on capital gains which he called a massive needless 
tax break to the wealthiest 1 percent a giveaway that will cost 
working americans billions 
but the chairman sidestepped any confrontation with the 
democrats who supported bush 
he called capital gains a tough vote and said many of the 
members who didnt vote with the democratic leadership position 
thought they were doing what was in the best interests of their 
constituents 
i am not here to criticize democrats he said 
during their meeting the democrats undid key elements of the 
agreement reached between michael dukakis and jesse jackson at the 
partys 1988 convention 
the dnc voted to restore its members to their status as 
unpledged delegates to nominating conventions the body also voted 
to require that any future convention deals be ratified by the dnc 
brown who was jacksons chief negotiator at the 1988 
convention supported the changes and said he also would back a 
requirement that presidential candidates receive a minimum of 15 
percent of the vote in primaries and caucuses to qualify for 
receiving delegates part of the jacksondukakis deal was a rules 
change that eliminated thresholds 
the dnc also elected former louisiana democratic party chair 
kathy vick to succeed dorothy bush as party secretary 
mrs bush retired after 46 years in the office which placed her 
in the spotlight every four years when she called the roll of the 
states on the ballot for the presidential nomination 
the democrats also announced that seven cities are the finalists 
to host the 1992 democratic national convention they are new york 
houston detroit clevelandbrook park new orleans miami beach 
and seattle 
party officials also had expected atlanta site of the 1988 
convention to bid but city officials notified the democrats they 
would not enter the competition

a leaky pipe spilled 44000 gallons of diesel 
fuel into the snow at an american station at the south pole but is 
not expected to cause any environmental damage the national 
science foundation said thursday 
jeffrey norris an nsf spokesman confirmed in response to an 
inquiry that the fuel leak was discovered on aug 21 by personnel 
spending the antarctic winter at the united states amundsenscott 
south pole station 
he said the fuel drained down through the snow and is expected 
to be trapped against an ice layer 150 feet below the surface 
environmental impact said the spokesman is expected to be 
minimal 
there are no plants or wildlife in the area to be affected 
norris said 
norris said the spill represented no health hazard to personnel 
at the station and noted there is no immediate plan to clean it 
up 
antarctica now is in the midst of deep winter cold with 
temperatures continuously staying far below zero 
norris said the 20 scientists and technicians wintering at the 
station started searching for a leak in july when measurements 
showed that nine fuel tanks at the station were being drained 
faster than could be explained by ordinary usage the diesel is 
used to operate generators 
the leak was found in a pipe that carries the fuel from the 
storage tanks to the power generators norris said 
nsf officials made no public announcement of the spill but 
norris said the incident was reported to the us department of 
state the antarctic is controlled by an international treaty and 
the national science foundation is operates the us outposts at 
the bottom of the world 
the amundsenscott station sits on 9200 feet of snow and is 
the only outpost at the south pole 
norris said the incident is the second major spill of diesel 
fuel at the south pole station in 1975 22000 gallons of diesel 
fuel escaped into the snow when a storage tank collapsed

man scheduled to be hanged friday for murder 
according to us ambassador thomas r pickering mangena

to commute his death sentence and use their influence with pretoria 
on his behalf 
the united states and britain abstained the first time in the 
current assembly that they have been out of step with the rest of 
the international community 
pickering said washington distinquishes between political 
prisoners and those convicted of nonpolitical crimes 
there can be no circumstances in which a violent murder such 
as the one in this case what has come to be called necklacing 
could be considered a rightful political act said pickering 
necklacing involves placing a gasolinesoaked tire around the 
neck of the victim and lighting it 
boesman is a member of the guerrillabacked african national 
congress the movement banned in south africa for its fight to end

two bills requiring seafood inspection were 
introduced in congress thursday as lawmakers search for a way to 
protect humans from contaminants eaten by sea life 
agriculture chairman kika de la garza dtexas offered 
legislation he calls federal inspection for seafood healthfulness 
or the fish act of 1989 it puts the agriculture department in 
charge of inspecting seafood much the way it does meat and poultry 
rep dan glickman dkan came out with the consumer seafood 
safety act which splits the responsibility between usda and the 
food and drug administration 
the fda and national academy of standards have the most 
experience in establishing scientific standards to protect against 
adulteration by which food should be inspected glickman said 
the usda has inspection expertise that can be relied upon to 
effectively carry out the guidelines established at fda 
de la garza said the inspection should be in usda where 
historically the food inspection process has been from the 
beginning 
another seafood inspection measure is being worked on by the 
house energy and commerce committee and similar proposals also 
have been introduced in the senate 
all are attempts to reassure consumers who cut back their 
consumption of seafood last year after 10 years of steady increases 
seafood is the only flesh food in the united states not subject 
to comprehensive and rigorous mandatory safety inspection by the 
federal government 
both consumer and industry groups favor strengthening the 
regulations 
public voice a nonprofit organization that has been seeking 
mandatory seafood inspection since 1983 praised both glickman and 
de la garza for their efforts but favors glickmans bill 
glickmans measure would establish a strong federal program 
driven by public health considerations said ellen haas 
executive director of public voice 
the national fisheries institute a trade association of 1000 
seafood companies supports de la garzas bill it contains the 
authority and direction needed to provide comprehensive regulation 
and inspection of seafood products and plants said lee weddig 
the institutes executive vice president

reduce the chance of fire when a plane crashes 
the new regulation will cost airlines 197 million and require 
changes in nearly 27000 fuel tank access doors the federal 
aviation administration estimated the order which will take 
effect 30 days after official publication gives airlines two years 
to comply 
the agency said there have been several incidents where fuel 
tank access panels on airliners wings have failed including an 
august 1985 accident involving a british air tours boeing 737 in 
manchester england that killed 55 of the 137 people on board 
that incident led to an order to strengthen fuel tanks in all 
us 737s the new action extends the order to all large jets that 
have fuel doors that might be exposed to damage from flying engine 
parts pieces of tire tread or other debris in an accident 
the faa said boeingbuilt airliners would be most heavily 
affected because they have fuel access covers on the bottom 
surfaces of the wings where they are most likely to be damaged 
most other aircraft have them on the top the faa said

imelda marcos unwavering in her assertions of 
innocence now stands alone to face charges that she and her late 
husband stole millions from their philippine homeland 
mrs marcos 60 is scheduled for trial in new york in march 
along with the eight others who were indicted with her and her 
husband former philippine president ferdinand marcos the 
72yearold marcos died thursday in hawaii 
i look forward to defending myself she said recently if 
i have to face the court alone so be it i will walk into the 
courtroom with my head held high 
she said she expects to be acquitted return to private life and 
participate in philippine politics from a distance if she is 
never allowed to return from hawaii where she and marcos lived in 
exile 
until her legal problems are resolved mrs marcos is barred by 
court order from transferring most of the couples alleged vast 
wealth on june 9 federal prosecutors in manhattan filed a civil 
racketeering lawsuit to guarantee claims against the deposed 
philippines president after his death 
on oct 31 1988 mrs marcos pleaded innocent in us district 
court in manhattan to racketeering charges her husbands ill 
health kept him from making the trip from hawaii to new york for 
arraignment and he was severed from the case last april 
tobacco heiress doris duke put up 5 million to secure mrs 
marcoss bail 
i was born ostentatious said mrs marcos who wore a 
fulllength chiffon aquamarine gown to her arraignment they will 
list my name in the dictionary someday they will use imeldific 
to mean ostentatious extravagance 
it wasnt until after the marcoses february 1986 exile that the 
world glimpsed the full meaning of imeldific symbolized by the 
former first ladys 3000 pairs of shoes 
the marcoses philippines palace opened to the public in march 
1986 revealed bulletproof powder rooms a bedside grand piano and 
a videotape of a birthday party the guests in baby clothes and a

the federal indictment issued in new york last october accuses 
mrs marcos and her husband of stealing 168 million

debt 
either directly or indirectly the money allegedly was spent on 
prime manhattan real estate a 4 million home in beverly hills

the chairman of a nasa advisory panel said 
thursday that he questioned the space agencys decision to develop 
a new generation of shuttle booster rocket 
joe sutter chairman of the aerospace safety advisory panel 
told a house subcommittee on space science and applications that 
nasa could continue to rely on the redesigned solid rocket motor 
that has been in use since the 1986 challenger explosion 
the national aeronautics and space administration sutter said 
should instead focus its attention and limited financial resources 
on safety programs within the current shuttle program 
that need is critical while nasa accelerates the shuttle 
program building up to 14 annual launches by 1994 he said 
we still consider the space shuttle an inherently highrisk 
endeavor he said the present nasa management organization 
with its greater emphasis on safety and quality assurance which is 
excellent should be maintained and strengthened 
the hearing of the science space and technology subcommittee 
was called to review the annual report of sutters panel the 
report in march had contained a recommendation to postpone 
development of a socalled advanced solid rocket motor and focus on 
the redesigned version 
however nasa decided to procure the new rocket saying it can 
deliver heavier loads and more important addresses a number of 
safety problems brought out by the challenger disaster 
the new design emphasizes welds over bolts allows for 
mechanical closing of joints and has different seals that permit 
more visual inspection nasa said the joints were blamed in the 
challenger disaster 
nasa in april awarded a 11 billion contract to lockheed to 
develop 44 advanced motors with the first to be delivered in 1994 
it is still the no 1 priority with me said jr thompson 
nasa deputy administrator it is the last system that failed 
when it fails it always fails catastrophically 
thompson also said the manufacture of the new rocket motor would 
be less labor intensive and thus less prone to human error 
the panel said that many of the improvements could be 
incorporated into the current design 
sutter told the panel that nasa needs to have a triedandtrue 
shuttle rocket ready for the space station program in 1995 since 
it will rely on the shuttle for construction supply and operation

the environmental protection agency on 
thursday added 93 toxic waste sites including five at two nuclear 
weapons plants to its priority list for cleanup under the federal 
superfund law 
the additional sites and the removal of 31 others from the list 
brings to 1194 the number of waste sites where chemicals or other 
material have been judged so much of a threat that they are 
eligible for federal funds for cleanup 
the federal superfund law since 1980 has allocated more than 8 
billion raised through taxes on chemicals and crude oil for 
removal of toxic materials from the top priority sites but so far 
cleanup has been concluded at only a handful of sites 
the addtional target locations for cleanup announced thursday 
were spread over 32 states and puerto rico seventeen of the 
additional sites were in pennsuylvania nine in california and 
seven in washington state 
among the new sites were 11 federal facilities including the 
rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado and four in the 
governments nuclear complex near hanford wash 
these facilities joined 52 other military installations nuclear 
fuel processing plants and other plants already on the epa priority 
cleanup list 
as the epa added to the number of sites eligible for federal 
superfund cleanup funds it also announced that 27 sites previously 
on the priority list had been shifted to a different cleanup 
program although cleanup activities would continue on those sites 
the federal money would come from another program 
these 27 sites are active hazardous waste treatment storage or 
disposal installations that will be handled under the federal waste 
disposal law 
four sites were deleted altogether from the cleanup list the 
agency said it had downgraded the threats posed by the four 
the priority list of 1194 cleanup sites represents the worst of 
an estimated 30000 hazardous waste dumps in need of treatment or 
cleanup in the country 
the epa has been under sharp criticism from congress and 
elsewhere for its failure to make more progress earlier this 
month a study by the rand corp concluded that the superfund 
program has been superslow 
during the programs first eight years cleanup was finished at 
only 34 of the 1175 sites on the priority list at the time the 
rand corp analysis said the report also criticized the agency for 
not spending more of the money provided by congress for cleanup and 
for not recovering more of the costs from polluters 
epa officials have acknowledged problems in the superfund 
program and recently announced plans to pursue polluters more 
vigorously to get them to pay more for cleanups

laws designed to protect victims of 
hurricane hugo from price gouging may actually delay the flow of 
supplies to rebuild this stormravaged city an economist says 
there are strong needs for certain items when the word gets 
out you are willing to pay 200 for a sheet of plywood 20 
million selfemployed contractors will start shipping in plywood 
said david laband an associate professor in economics at clemson 
university in western south carolina 
if there is no potential for a sizeable profit there is no 
financial incentive to send additional supplies into the area 
laband said wednesday in a telephone interview 
charleston has imposed a pricegouging ordinance that calls for 
fines of 250 and jail terms upon conviction 
mayor joseph riley jr defined price gouging as selling items at 
prices substantially higher than prices before the storm its 
hard to define but i know it when i see it he said 
earlier this week an outoftown contractor was arrested for 
allegedly charging 20000 to remove downed trees from a yard 
gov carroll campbell has said the state also will prosecute 
suspected price gougers under antitrust laws 
but laband said any price increases as a result of price gouging 
tend to be temporary prices fall almost as immediately as they 
rise he said 
there are similar supply issues in other areas that people do 
not get as excited about laband said for instance he said math 
and science teachers are in short supply and can demand higher 
salaries 
the people who have the goods are in a position to gouge 
their employers he said 
the same theory applies to ice 
prices come down for an item when there is plenty of it he 
said when prices are artificially low and there is no supply 
side pressure you end up having no ice for two weeks and people 
are worse off

a homosexual man said thursday he is seeking 
20 million in damages against members of a skinhead gang for 
alleged antihomosexual violence 
the dc superior court suit alleges the group of shavenhead 
men and women planned and executed a vicious gaybashing 
campaign in which rodney johnson was beaten and robbed 
johnson said he was walking home from work at a restaurant in 
the georgetown section of washington during the early morning hours 
of sept 17 1988 when he was attacked by a group of men with 
baseball bats 
while i was being beaten they were shouting die faggot 
die the 37yearold admitted homosexual said in a telephone 
interview 
johnson suffered a concussion fractured skull collapsed lungs 
and broken bones in the attack 
six men and two women all believed to be minors from the 
washinton area are named in the suit three of them were charged 
with assault in connection with the incident 
i felt that there should be some other form of justice or some 
way to get at these guys and all the other people responsible for 
this type of thing said johnson of his suit which was filed 
earlier this month 
i feel we all have the right to walk down the street without 
being attacked either physically or verbally johnson said 
gays are not protected in lot of ways under some of these laws 
i think this case is an unprecedented case it is the first 
time the skinheads have been sued for their violent hateful 
behavior said paula ettelbrick johnsons attorney with the 
lambda legal defense and education fund 
its also the first time that a gay victim has sued the 
skinheads under the federal civil rights laws she added 
explaining damages were being sought under a 100yearold law 
known as the ku klux klan act 
we want to set a precedent that the skinheads are the present 
day embodiment of a hate group she said 
other lawyers civil rights and homosexual support groups 
joining the suit include attorney linda delaney of lyons mack 
delaney young the dc gay and lesbian activists alliance the

a public interest group filed suit thursday 
against the food and drug administration trying to force the 
agency to ban red dye no 3 as a cancercausing food additive 
the additive which among other things gives marachino cherries 
their bright glow represents a completely unnecessary risk of 
cancer to american consumers said william b schultz an 
attorney for public citizen 
the lawsuit filed in us district court cites repeated 
extensions of the fdas deadline for ruling on the safety of the 
additive as evidence that fda commissioner frank young has acted in 
bad faith 
fda spokesman jeff nesbitt said the agency had no comment on the 
suit 
the fda on aug 30 extended for two months its deadline for 
deciding whether to ban red dye no 3 that pushed the dealine to 
oct 30 
the house in july passed legislation calling for further study 
of the food coloring the senate has not acted on the legislation 
since 1960 when congress called for a ban on foods that cause 
cancer in laboratory animals red dye no 3 and other additives 
have been on a provisional list that allowed them to remain on the 
market for an additional two years pending further study 
public citizen said that since then the fda has granted 40 
extensions to the provisional listing of red dye no 3

heeding president bushs warning 
that the nation is imperiled when children emerge into adulthood 
ignorant and unskilled the nations governors joined him 
thursday in framing national goals for improving americas public 
schools 
the objectives product of a twoday education summit range 
from reversing a dropout rate that sends nearly one youth in three 
into the job market without a diploma to making educators more 
accountable for their pupils classroom performance 
at a convocation with the governors a beaming bush sported a 
blue and orange striped necktie in the colors of the university of 
virginia site of the summit and declared himself pleased by the 
commitment the creativity and the knowledge that my fellow chief 
executives bring here to this education reform agenda 
a joint statement agreed upon by bush and the governors put 
special emphasis on expanding prekindergarten programs that 
prepare poor youngsters for schooling 
bush and the governors also said they wanted to cut through 
federal regulations and swap red tape for results 
gov terry branstad a republican from iowa said the summit 
marked the first time governors and a president had agreed upon 
specific resultsoriented goals for education historically a 
matter under local control 
but democratic gov richard celeste of ohio said the jury was 
still out on whether bush had earned the title education 
president he said the administration painted itself in a 
corner by foreclosing the possibility of spending more on schools 
the president would have been better served if somebody had 
said look mr president we can do without these three stealth 
bombers celeste said 
republican govs george deukmejian of california and thomas kean 
of new jersey cautioned that the proposed reforms may be resisted 
by professional educators 
they like the status quo duekmejian said the difficulty 
is going to be that there is going to have to be some 
restructuring some accountability some redirecting of funds to 
meet the primary objectives 
said kean if the people involved in education oppose and 
stand in the way it will be difficult and timeconsuming to get 
any of these things accomplished 
winding up the proceedings under sunny skies bush said he was 
determined to make the summit make a difference 
we just cannot let it sit here and end here and i promise you 
that i wont he told the governors 
weve reached agreement on the need for national performance 
goals on the need for more flexibility and accountability the 
need for restructuring and choice and the need for more federal 
support for the prekindergarten education process bush said 
democratic gov booth gardner of washington said that while 
federal money was limited the governors and bush had agreed that 
whatever additional education dollars might become available will 
be applied to the issue of early childhood education and head 
start the program intended to prepare 3and 4yearolds for 
school 
were going to empower teachers by letting them take over the 
classroom again said gov garrey carruthers of new mexico a 
republican 
arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat said the governors 
expect to be held personally accountable for the progress we make 
in moving this country to a brighter future 
the summit didnt reach conclusions on how to pay for the 
reforms that all agreed were essential to the nations future 
we just dont think that at this time its worth letting the 
summit break apart over a fight over how much money theyll have to 
put up next year said clinton 
in his speech the president called for greater competition in 
education between students between teachers and between 
schools and a report card for all in which parents 
educators and students could all see how their schools rank 
the american people are ready for radical reforms bush 
said we must not disappoint them 
he ticked off what national tests have shown the problem to be 
he said fewer than one high school junior in four can write an 
adequate persuasive letter and only half can manage decimals 
fractions and percentages and barely one in three can locate the 
civil war in the correct half century 
he concluded no modern nation can long afford to allow so 
many of its sons and daughters to emerge into adulthood ignorant 
and unskilled 
though far from radical the agenda framed by the governors and 
the white house looked toward greater local responsibility for 
making schools work better 
the goals called for helping all children prepare for school 
through nutrition programs head start and the like making 
educators more accountable for students progress keeping drugs 
out of schools bolstering onthejob education to make workers 
more competitive improving literacy throughout the population 
giving educators more flexibility by reducing state and federal 
regulations combatting a dropout rate that has been approaching 30 
percent 
governors generally seemed pleased with their sessions with bush 
and his cabinet feeling that national attention had been focused 
on the ailments of a public education system which in bushs word 
had turned stagnant 
while millions of americans read for pleasure the president 
said returning to his particulars millions of others dont read 
at all and while millions go to college millions may never 
graduate from high school

the soviet government has slashed its projected 
budget deficit for 1989 from an estimated 187 billion to 143 
billion largely through cuts in government spending on 
construction factory equipment and defense tass said thursday 
since nearly all businesses in the soviet union are 
governmentowned the budget includes most of the capital 
investment projects in the country 
the official tass news agency report did not say if vladimir 
panskov a deputy finance minister detailed the defense cuts in 
his testimony to a committee of the supreme soviet legislature 
soviet officials said earlier this week they planned to trim the 
defense budget from 119 billion this year to 109 billion in 1990 
as part of a planned 14 percent cut in military spending by 1991 
separately gen anatoly shabanov told tass that projected 
military spending cuts would save the soviet union 46 billion but 
the report did not say when that budget reduction would occur nor 
did it say if he was counting from the current budget or from 
onceprojected increases 
shabanov also said the military will shift to the civilian 
economy 45000 pieces of major equipment in 1989 and 1990 
including trucks earthmovers and telephone facilities he said the 
amount to be transferred by the army this year is valued at 774 
million 
legislators continued debating the budget in supreme soviet 
committees thursday alexander orlov from the ural mountains 
criticized the 155 billion food subsidies tass said orlov 
suggested such funds would be better spent improving agricultural 
efficiency 
the committee on law added a clause to a strike bill that says 
only the supreme soviet or its parent body the congress of 
peoples deputies would have the power to ban strikes that panel 
also debated a blanket prohibition on strikes in certain areas of 
the economy but came to no decision tass said

ecuador said on thursday it is ready to 
ask for international help to restart oil production here one day 
after a strike by texaco workers paralyzed the nations petroleum 
shipments 
the strike shut down the transecuador pipeline which connects 
oil fields in the eastern jungle with esmeraldas on the pacific 
coast 310 miles away 
luis roman manager for the state oil corporation petroecuador 
told a news conference if company technicians cannot reopen 
production in 48 hours petroecuador will seek help from state oil 
companies in venezuela colombia and brazil 
he reported that before the strike ecuador was producing 290000 
barrels of crude daily more than twice its domestic daily needs 
the government put the entire country under a state of emergency 
wednesday night and ordered the military to take charge of the 
affected installations 
strikers are demanding severance pay from texaco which is due 
to turn over operation of the pipeline to petroecuador on oct 1 
texaco officials refused to comment on the demand 
the labor ministry says severance should be paid by texaco 
petroecuador which now has a minority share in the consortium made 
up of the two companies says it is not liable for severance pay 
the 170 workers who operate the pipeline pumping stations and 
shiploading facilities for texaco are demanding about 43 million 
from the company before the turnover oct 1 hundreds of texaco 
office workers in quito walked out in support of the strikers 
roman said petroecuador sent technical personnel thursday to the 
main oil region of lago agrio 120 miles east of quito to restart 
production after the military expelled strikers who had taken over 
facilities 
he said the company was considering an emergency measure using a 
pipeline that runs from lago agrio into neighboring colombia it 
connects with a colombian pipeline at the jungle city of oritos to 
carry oil to tumaco colombia on the pacific coast 
roman said the government has reacted swiftly and forcefully 
since losses from the strike are surpassing 4 million a day 
he said the country has 15 days of refined oil products and 
crude oil reserves for another 15 days ecuador uses 120000 
barrels of oil daily 
the state of emergency restricts civil rights and freedom of 
movement in signing the decree president rodrigo borja a social 
democrat said internal commotion threatened the nations most 
important source of income 
ecuador a member of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries relies on oil for 60 percent of its export earnings it 
earned more than 1 billion in oil sales last year

residents who suffered damage to their 
homes and property from hurricane hugos fury can expect to feel 
shock anger depression anxiety and a whole range of emotional 
pain experts say 
theres so many emotions going on right now almost 
everybodys had some major disruptions theyre going to have to 
deal with their losses sharon foley a social worker at southern 
pines psychiatric hospital in charleston said wednesday 
the emotional upheaval may result in nightmares sleep disorders 
and jumpiness some feelings may last for weeks months or even a 
year doctors said 
hugo was an experience of being immersed in chaos of people 
losing everything they possessed of not knowing if they would be 
alive said dr linda austin associate professor of psychiatry 
at medical university of south carolina 
it really rattled us to our roots said austin coordinator 
of the schools crisis response effort to the killer storm which 
was blamed for 29 deaths in the united states 
one of the most common emotions is that of anger 
what were angry at is that hurricane hugo came and demolished 
our homes and our beautiful city but how do you get mad at a 
hurricane austin said 
the university is setting up a speakers bureau to talk about 
psychological trauma to schools churches and businesses 
the charleston county mental health center has offered a 24hour 
mobile crisis unit since sunday that allows doctors to send a nurse 
and a social worker into the field to prescribe medication for 
stress 
southern pines has set up a crisis line and referral service for 
people having problems the crisis line in operation since monday 
is taking hundreds of calls a day on five lines officials said 
residents should not isolate themselves and should talk about 
their feelings with family or friends 
the main thing is to be aware that these feelings can occur 
people should be open to sharing their experience said dr 
stephen mcleodbryant medical director for the countys mental 
health center 
anxiety can also lead to flashbacks if the wind gusts and 
rattles the windows people might wake up in a cold sweat and feel 
like theyre back in a hurricane mcleodbryant said 
if you hold in these emotions you could develop emotional and 
physical problems its going to come out in some way ms foley 
said 
thousands of people are without homes or still lack basic 
necessities such as electrical service and water others have been 
unable to return to their jobs 
but experts advise residents to try to get back to normal as 
quickly as possible even if its something as simple as going to 
bed and getting up at the same time 
doctors also advise residents not to vent their anger at 
spouses loved ones or public officials energy should be targeted 
to rebuilding 
dealing with these emotions makes you look at whats really 
important in your life it helps you put things in perspective

guerrilla leader jonas savimbi on thursday 
accused african leaders of undermining peace prospects in angola 
and urged the united states which backs his forces to do more to 
end the 14year civil war 
savimbi who is to visit washington next week said neither his 
national union for the total independence of angola called unita 
nor troops of the sovietbacked marxist government are making any 
effort to observe a ceasefire declared in june 
he spoke to reporters at the end of a fourday emergency 
congress of guerrilla officials at his bush headquarters 
in a secret ballot delegates voted 2985to1 in favor of 
calling for a new ceasefire and 15month transition with a 
coalition government followed by free elections savimbi said 
he also said president kenneth kaunda of zambia and several 
other african leaders have aggravated the situation by asserting at 
a summit in zimbabwe that savimbi had agreed to temporary exile and 
to his guerrillas being integrated into the angolan army 
these proposals never have been accepted by his movement and 
were introduced by the angolan government said savimbi he 
withdrew a previous offer to stay out of a possible temporary 
coalition government saying his movement reserves the right to 
pick its own members of such a government 
unita calls for elections and nothing else savimbi said 
if democracy and elections are good for namibia and good for 
poland why not for angola 
the guerrillas never have had a chance to test their popularity 
at the polls they have been at war since portuguese colonizers 
hastily withdrew granting independence in 1975 and leaving rival 
black factions to fight it out for power the victory went to the 
popular movement for the liberation of angola led by president 
jose eduardo dos santos 
zaires president mobutu sese seko mediated talks leading to a 
june 24 truce savimbi said thursday this attempt was unrealistic 
because neither side had time to notify their combatants 
heavy fighting broke out shortly afterward and both sides 
accused the other of mounting attacks guerrilla officers said two 
angolan government offensives have been repulsed but a third 
continues 
savimbi said his movement seeks new talks and he proposed a new 
truce monitored by a multinational african force possibly 
including nigeria togo and morocco 
the ceasefire would lead the way to a coalition government and 
then elections supervised by the united nations and organization of 
african unity he said but savimbi noted this cannot happen unless 
the government agrees to rewrite its constitution which 
establishes a oneparty political system 
we cannot join a marxistleninist party savimbi said 
they have to make room for us 
the guerrillas are prepared to make real concessions in 
negotiations he said but also are willing to risk a cutoff of 
foreign aid rather than agree to unacceptable terms 
savimbi voiced confidence that us aid will continue but said 
many americans are not wellinformed about angola 
we want the us to be more active he said suggesting 
american officials convince the soviet union to join a push for a 
negotiated settlement 
moscow still backs the luanda government south africa provided 
military aid to the rebels during much of the war but agreed to 
halt it as part of a regional accord in exchange for a phased 
withdrawal of the 50000 cuban troops fighting on the government 
side in angola 
savimbi said he believes cuba is honoring its withdrawal 
timetable

a civil righs group thursday accused the fbi 
of trying to intimidate a music company for distributing a 
controversial record that the fbi contends encourages violence 
against police 
its extraordinarily frightening to get a letter from the fbi 
saying the fbi has officially decided they dont like your music 
and to intimate that the music is going to cause violence 
said barry lynn legislative counsel for the american civil 
liberties union 
the letter was written by milt ahlerich fbi assistant director 
for public affairs to priority records about the song tha 
police by the rap group nwa the songs title contains an 
obscenity 
it the letter intimidates the recipient because the source 
is the federal government and is likely to have a very 
chilling effect on that record company and that artist lynn said 
lynn said he and representatives of music in action a group 
concerned with censorship of rock music met with a justice 
department official monday to demand a retraction of the letter 
thomas boyd director of the departments office of policy 
development didnt take a position on the letter but said he would 
look into it lynn said 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said thursday that the 
department will review all of their concerns and points of view 
and try to be helpful where we can 
eramian said ahlerich was expressing his point of view and 
thats his right under free speech he is not advocating taking 
action hes just saying i dont believe you should be doing 
anything that advocates violence against police 
ahlerich in an interview thursday said the letter was 
absolutely not a threat against the los angeles record company 
and that its their decision to distribute it 
the song includes lines such as beat a police outta shape 
and takin out a police will make my day the song says police 
believe every nigger is selling narcotics 
gunfire is heard in the background of the record 
ahlerich said we wanted to take the opportunity to supply 
priority with information about violence associated with police 
officers and concern about violence in this country it was not 
anything past that 
ahlerich said he had received a couple of letters from 
anticensorship groups but no response from priority 
the associated press obtained a copy of the aug 1 letter from 
the trade publication radio amp records the letter written on 
official fbi stationery was addressed to gui manganiello 
prioritys national promotions director 
advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law 
enforcement community take exception to such action ahlerich 
wrote adding that he felt the song advocated such violence 
seventyeight law enforcement officers were feloniously slain 
in the line of duty in 1988 four more than in 1987 law 
enforcement officers dedicate their lives to the protection of our 
citizens and recordings such as the one from nwa are both 
discouraging and degrading to these brave dedicated officers 
i wanted you to be aware of the fbis position relative to this 
song and its message 
manganiello did not immediately return a call seeking comment

top executives at recognition equipment inc 
of dallas were victimized by a michigan consultant and the former 
vice chairman of the postal board of governors a defense attorney 
said thursday 
the postal governor peter voss and detroitarea consultant 
john gnau played us like a violin atorney robert bennett said 
in federal court at the criminal trial of rei and two of its 
officers 
rei hired gnau at vosss urging and the company agreed to pay 
gnau 325000 in a little more than a year in an attempt to get 
400 million in postal service contracts 
they were pumping us up into believing rei would get the 
postal business bennett said 
the company along with chief operating officer william moore 
and marketing vice president robert reedy are accused of 
conspiring with voss gnau and others to fraudulently obtain the 
postal contracts to build mailsorting equipment 
us postal inspectors uncovered an arrangement in which gnau 
allegedly agreed to share some of the money he got from rei with 
voss 
bennett who represents reedy said rei executives were unaware 
of voss and gnaus hidden agenda 
voss and gnau were looking for pigeons bennett said if a 
company was trying to get business with the postal service and 
not doing very well they would be targeted by voss and gnau 
said bennett 
voss and gnau agreed that rei would never be told about the 
arrangement the lawyer added 
bennett said that in order for the government to prove rei was 
part of a conspiracy it would have to show that voss and gnau told 
rei executives we can make music together here is how much it 
will cost 
that didnt happen bennett said 
the attorney said reedy failed to tell postal inspectors the 
truth just once an incident for which reedy later apologized to 
the government and for which he hasnt been charged with a crime 
a us postal inspector asked reedy on april 8 1986 how reedy 
had met gnau reedy told the inspector it was through a public 
relations executive according to bennett 
in fact it was voss who urged reedy in the fall of 1984 to hire 
gnaus firm 
the first witness in the trial postal contract officer john 
simmons testified that voss at one meeting in 1985 criticized 
postal official currie boswell who favored the type of 
mailsorting equipment that was manufactured by reis competitors 
voss kind of blamed mr boswells group for going down the 
wrong path simmons testified adding that voss had leveled a 
parting shot at boswell as people filed out of the meeting 
maybe well send you some flowers voss told boswell 
according to simmons signifying that boswells career was in 
peril boswell currently is director of the postal services office 
of operational requirements 
voss who headed ronald reagans 1980 ohio presidential 
campaign received a fouryear prison term in 1986 after pleading 
guilty to expense account fraud and taking an illegal gratuity from 
gnau in connection with efforts to steer postal contracts to rei 
gnau who headed reagans 1980 michigan campaign was sentenced 
to three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal 2500 gratuity 
to voss in connection with work on behalf of rei 
voss and gnau are to be government witnesses in the nonjury 
trial before us district court judge george revercomb

percent denmark 33 greece 59 and holland 38 it said 
among women in that age bracket the figure for portugal is 26 
percent denmark 44 holland 41 and greece 35 the survey found 
the eec said the findings were an average of four surveys 
conducted since 1987 covering about 4000 people aged 16 and older 
in each of 10 eec countries plus 1200 in luxembourg and 2500 in 
britain 
the highest number of doctors smoking was in spain with 45 
percent followed by italy with 41 percent greece and portugal 39 
percent and denmark 38 percent the survey said britain came 
lowest at 10 percent 
turning to teachers it found the highest smoking levels in

year in the 320millionstrong community it congratulated portugal 
for its very advanced legislation to curb smoking which 
includes a complete ban on advertising and a prohibition of the 
sale of hightar cigarettes 
it warned however that portugal and other southern european 
countries register the highest smoking levels among young men and 
attributed it to the low price of cigarettes there 
the eec noted what it called a paradox the highest levels of 
female smoking were in countries where cigarettes were most 
expensive and suggested that the cigarette as a symbol of female 
equality outweighs economic constraints

when 10yearold joshua dennis was rescued 
from an abandoned mine after five days he had long since exhausted 
his tiny supply of licorice but thought hed been missing only a 
couple of days 
mostly i just slept a lot of the time i got tired of looking 
around and just sat there the boy said thursday i wasnt 
feeling very lonely or scared but i cried once 
his feet mottled purple with mild frostbite and propped on a 
pillow joshua spoke from his hospital bed just 24 hours after 
rescuers found him on a ledge some 2000 feet inside the mine where 
he got lost during a scouting expedition 
i was just following the wall after being separated from 
his father inside the mine last friday night he said there was 
a whole bunch of exits and i went down the wrong one 
joshua is in good condition and expected to go home to suburban 
kearns over the weekend his doctor at primary childrens medical 
center said 
hes squared away hell do just fine dr ted jenkins 
said 
the boys father terry dennis said joshua went into the hidden 
treasure mine with 10 bitesize pieces of licorice in his pocket 
he exhausted the meager cache only after slowly sucking one piece 
at a time he had no water and was dehydrated when found wednesday 
afternoon 
joshua cub scout strayed from the boy scout group his father 
was helping supervise on an expedition into the former silver lead 
and zinc mine in the oquirrh mountains 45 miles southwest of salt 
lake city 
after five days hope had all but vanished that the boy would be 
found alive then a search team that had passed within 150 feet of 
him in half a dozen sweeps heard his faint cry and discovered him 
on the ledge 
joshua said that during his vigil he had heard searchers voices 
a few times but his cries for help werent heard 
i wondered how long it was going to take me to find my way 
out he said i couldnt really hear what they were saying i 
called for help but not one of the times they couldnt hear me 
at the head of his bed was a white hard hat inscribed with the 
names of the two utah power amp light co mine rescue team members 
who found him 
i was thinking if it was day or night or what day it was i 
thought it was night and when they told me it was wednesday i 
thought it was sunday joshua said 
sheriffs deputies utility crews search dogs and dozens of 
volunteers had scoured the mines tunnels and surrounding canyon 
areas in their search finally concluding that joshua probably had 
left the mine only to fall into one of hundreds of other abandoned 
mines nearby 
but ray guymon and gary christensen returned to doublecheck an 
ore pocket with a local historian john skinner whose grandfather 
once was superintendent of the same mine 
christensen found joshua in a 6by20foot cavity in the ore 
pocket about 500 feet from where he was last seen

out hope thursday of israel and palestinian arabs holding 
negotiations on the future of the west bank and gaza 
but baker was cautious at a news conference after meeting 
jointly with foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmet 
abdelmeguid of egypt 
there may be some potential for progress he said but 
baker added we really will not know until key members of the 
israeli cabinet meet in jerusalem next wednesday

shamir for negotiations with palestinian arabs to be elected on the 
west bank and in gaza 
he said a 10point formula for negotiations advanced by egyptian 
president hosni mubarak was not in any sense a competing 
proposal 
some of mubaraks points upset shamir particularly having one 
or two of the palestinians deported during the rebellion 
participate in the negotiations 
mubarak also demanded that israel commit itself to relinquishing 
territory in exchange for peace 
baker stressed the us goal was to look for ways to move the 
process forward 
he added were in this thing to try to find a way to move 
toward peace 
baker has been in new york all week meeting with foreign 
ministers who are attending the special session of the united 
natiions general assembly he will hold a news conference friday 
before returning to washington

friday met separately with israeli deputy prime minister shimon 
peres 
he told peres no palestinian objedtionable to israel would be in 
the negotiating delegation

tne negotiations 
in a sudden flurry of mideast diplomacy soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze met with arens and offered to act as an 
intermediary between the palestinians and israel 
baker was not impressed noting the complications in getting 
mideast talks started he said i dont react positively to this

the food and drug administration on thursday 
formally downgraded its rating of a generic drug made by bolar 
pharmaceutical co for treating high blood pressure saying it is 
not equivalent to dyazide the brandname product 
by changing the code it assigns bolars product the fda is 
telling physicians that it does not consider the generic drug to 
have the same therapeutic value as the brandname drug 
the fda had announced plans for the change on aug 28 when it 
also began moving to withdraw the generic from the market because 
of questions about whether the drug has the same effect as dyzaide 
the removal process is still under way 
in a letter to copiague nybased bolar carl c peck 
director of the fdas center for drug evaluation and research said 
significant questions remain as to the reliability of the data 
the company submitted to the fda as part of safety and 
effectiveness tests conducted last year 
there appear to be significant misrepresentations in your 
documentation of this raw ingredient testing which you have not 
adequately explained he said these facts alone warrant a 
change in the therapeutic equivalence rating 
he also cited unorthodox practices and inconsistent 
representations of information in the reporting to fda of 
bioequivalence testing results this testing required for fda 
approval to make and sell copies of brandname drugs is designed 
to show that a generic drug dissolves in the body at roughly the 
same rate and produces approximately the same effect as the 
brandname product 
bolar officials could not be reached for comment their offices 
said they had left for the day 
bolar is one of 11 generic drug companies the fda is 
investigating after disclosures of fraud and corruption involving 
some companies and employees in fdas generic drug division and 
admissions by some companies that they had provided false data to 
the agency 
the agency is also sampling 30 of the most prescribed generic 
drugs and their brandname counterparts to test the safety of these 
products

ferdinand e marcos succumbed to cardiac arrest 
thursday but even in death he remained an unwanted exile his 
remains barred from us air lanes his political legacy still 
stirring passions in his philippine homeland 
marcos who ruled the philippines for more than 20 years before 
being ousted in february 1986 died at 1240 am thursday at st 
francis medical center he was 72 
doctors said kidney and lung failure and a widespread infection 
contributed to the cardiac arrest listed as the cause of death 
the canny combative politician who governed at times as a 
democrat at times as a dictator died without facing trial on us 
criminal charges he plundered the philippine treasury 
while marcos spent nearly 10 months in the hospital his family 
begged philippine president corazon aquino to let him come home to 
die but she refused 
mrs aquino took office as a result of the popular revolt that 
drove marcos into exile and her government has survived six armed 
attempts to overthrow it she said she refused again after his 
death to allow his burial in the philippines for the sake of the 
tranquillity of the state and the order of society 
philippine opposition leaders urged her to reconsider 
it is just so wrong it is his birthright he is a filipino 
the greatest filipino said joe lazo president of the honolulu 
group friends of marcos 
later thursday the federal aviation administration in 
washington prohibited any aircraft from flying marcos remains out 
of the united states for the philippines saying it would create 
a danger to the safety of the aircraft and persons involved 
lazo said family and friends would pay respects at marcos 
hilltop home overlooking downtown honolulu and the pacific ocean 
marcos remains in a polished wooden casket were taken by hearse 
to the mansion thursday morning 
the house will be open to mourners 24 hours a day until sunday 
then his body will be taken to a local mortuary for viewing through 
thursday lazo said 
mrs marcos did not want reporters and photographers to view the 
body in a group thursday but said journalists could come in later 
without their cameras and notebooks lazo said 
a funeral mass is planned for next friday but there are no 
definite plans for burial lazo said he said mrs marcos would 
keep trying to bring her husband back to his homeland she knows 
thats what he wanted 
marcos mother who died in may 1988 has been embalmed several 
times and lies unburied because marcos was not allowed into the 
philippines for the funeral 
tomas buddy gomez philippine consul general in honolulu and 
an outspoken marcos critic said he would not attend the memorial 
service and urged mrs marcos not to exploit her husbands 
death 
marcos death was confirmed at about 115 am when his son 
ferdinand jr emerged from the intensive care unit and said his 
father had been taken to a higher place 
hopefully friends and detractors alike will look beyond the 
man to see what he stood for his vision his compassion and his 
total love of country said the composed younger marcos 
fathers not here anymore hes gone marcos widow imelda 
told about two dozen supporters outside the hospital room said 
family spokesman roger peyuan somber but dryeyed as she left the 
hospital dressed in black mrs marcos did not talk to reporters 
marcos family had told doctors to do everything they could to 
save his life and lifesupport equipment was not turned off until 
after marcos died peyuan said 
a staunch us ally during his presidency marcos claimed he was 
tricked by us authorities into leaving his homeland but he said 
he had no hard feelings toward former president reagan or president 
bush who as vice president traveled to manila in 1981 and praised 
marcos and his government for your adherence to democratic 
principles 
bush said thursday he was saddened by marcos death and offered 
his condolences to the family 
reagan said that nancy and i are deeply saddened and extend 
our sympathy and prayers to his family 
in manila senior military commanders met but there was no sign 
of extraordinary security or any promarcos demonstrations 
in his home province of ilocos norte where marcos remained 
popular many people wept at the news 
a federal grand jury in new york indicted marcos his wife and 
eight others on criminal racketeering charges last october in 
april marcos was separated from the case because of his health 
in an interview with the associated press in november marcos 
denied allegations that he and imelda had drained the philippines 
of billions of dollars and said he did not expect to live through 
a trial 
ill take my destiny whatever that may be but im going to 
fight for my dignity and honor he said 
marcos was elected president of his asian homeland in 1966 and 
ruled longer than any other philippine president 
in his second fouryear term he declared martial law under 
which thousands of opposition politicians students and other 
critics were jailed 
the pivotal event in marcos downfall was the assassination of 
political rival sen benigno aquino jr in 1983 as aquino returned 
to the philippines from selfimposed exile in the united states 
the slaying which filipinos blamed on marcos and his supporters 
galvanized the opposition and led to the election of aquinos widow 
marcos left a nation of 62 million people deep in debt and 
facing communist and moslemsecessionist uprisings 
besides the racketeering indictment which charged him with 
stealing nearly 200 million and stashing it in the united states 
marcos faced lawsuits and investigations in honolulu los angeles 
seattle washington dc virginia and his native country a us 
government civil suit ensures that claims against marcos estate 
did not die with him 
the philippine government claimed marcos and his associates 
embezzled up to 10 billion and stashed the funds abroad but 
marcos was regarded even by his enemies as a clever politician and 
strategist who understood his people better than any other 
philippine president 
he reduced widespread street violence built more than 60000 
miles of roads and 3354 schools and brought electricity to 
thousands of rural villages 
the eldest son of a lawyer and a schoolteacher ferdinand 
edralin marcos was born sept 11 1917 in sarrat about 250 miles 
north of manila 
during world war ii he claimed to have led a guerrilla band 
against the japanese occupiers of the philippines the claims 
later largely discredited helped him as a 31yearold lawyer to 
become the youngest representative elected to the philippine 
congress 
in 1954 after an 11day courtship marcos married imelda 
romualdez a 26yearold beauty queen the oldest of their three 
children imelda learned of her fathers death from her exile in 
morocco ferdinand jr called bong bong and irene born in 
1960 were with their mother thursday

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter refused 
to take action against canada for its us exports of durum wheat 
saying there is no proof of a lack of cooperative spirit on 
canadas part 
in a letter to rep byron dorgan dnd yeutter blamed a sharp 
rise in canadian durum exports on periodic shortfalls in us 
production and tight supplies caused by use of agriculture 
department loan and export subsidy programs 
the administration is committed to take action against 
canadas wheat export policies in the event that trade problems in 
this sector cannot be resolved cooperatively between our two 
countries yeutter wrote 
however a look at the facts surrounding recent increases in 
us imports of durum from canada does not indicate a lack of 
cooperative spirit on canadas part 
canada which did not ship any durum to the us before 1985 
now has 13 percent of the us market 
canada exported 23 million bushels to the us in the 198687 
marketing year 74 million bushels in 198788 and 684 million 
bushels for the 198889 marketing year that ended july 31 
durum which is grown primarily in north dakota is used to make 
pasta 
dorgan has been urging yeutter to pressure canada to reduce its 
durum exports and charged thursday that he reneged on a promise to 
ensure canada didnt dump grain on us markets after the two 
countries freetrade agreement took effect this year 
american producers are prohibited from selling wheat in canada 
until the levels of government subsidies in the two countries are 
determined to be equal

flagstaff 
im sure they got there as fast as they could but it seemed 
an eternity said the 66yearold woman from nashville tenn

the same plane also lost control while landing in february and 
cited a possible nosewheel centering problem 
ten of 21 people on board the de havilland dhc6 twin otter were 
killed wednesday when the grand canyon airlines plane veered from 
the runway into a wooded hill 300 yards away authorities said 
john lauber a member of the national transportation safety

stable condition thursday at flagstaff medical center about 75 
miles away 
federal investigators were at the crash site thursday ntsb team

said 
ms mayes who had a severely bruised right shoulder and a

tennessee by van when she is released from the hospital

about 2000 hours of flight time lauber said crosson was in his 
first year with the airline said ronald l warren vice president

sen alfonse damato said thursday he is 
blocking confirmation of president bushs nominee to head the urban 
mass transit administration to force a promise that the agency will 
study new york citys transit troubles 
damato rny put a hold on the nomination of brian w 
clymer of media pa preventing a confirmation vote by the full 
senate 
clymer a certified public accountant is a former director of 
the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority 
damato apparently is not the only senator objecting to clymers 
nomination according to reports published last month clymers 
nomination was blocked by other senators because of a questionable 
link to the scandalplagued department of housing and urban 
development 
clymers accounting firm reportedly received nobid contracts to 
audit the books of a pennsylvania developer that received a grant 
from the department of housing and urban development 
clymer was not available for comment late thursday according to 
richard centner an umta spokesman clymer has been filling the 
administrators job since alfred dellibovi left the job to became 
deputy hud secretary 
last april dellibovi announced umta would investigate safety at 
the mta which has been plagued by fires doors opening on moving 
trains crashes and other hazards 
but on thursday the senator said virtually no progress has 
been made on this probe and it appears to be going nowhere

china said thursday that reports it had begun 
unofficial talks with the vietnambacked government in cambodia are 
entirely groundless 
china has never had any relations with the illegal phnom penh 
regime the foreign ministry said in a statement 
the chief editor of a governmentsponsored magazine in phnom 
penh recently told the associated press that three chinese 
officials had discussed resumption of trade ties during a visit to 
cambodia early this year as part of a thai business group 
a foreign ministry official said another group of 15 chinese 
officials was expected in january and an east european diplomat 
said he believed cambodian military officials had conducted talks 
with chinese officials in the laotian capital of vientiane 
china is the main backer of the khmer rouge and other resistance 
factions fighting vietnamese troops and the forces of the phnom 
penh government 
earlier thursday a foreign ministry spokesman said vietnams 
claimed withdrawal of the last of its troops from cambodia was a 
sham and indicated china will continue to arm the resistance 
forces until a political settlement is reached among the warring 
factions 
the ministry said before a comprehensive just and reasonable 
political settlement of the kampuchea cambodia issue is realized 
china will never establish economic relations or any other 
relations with the phnom penh government 
it is despicable and futile for the phnom penh side to 
fabricate lies with ulterior motives split up and sow discord and 
confuse public opinion

troops and police went on full alert 
friday and security was reinforced at vital installations after 
president corazon aquino banned the burial of ferdinand marcos in 
the philippines 
the 72yearold marcos who ruled longer than any philippine 
president died thursday in exile in hawaii and opposition leaders 
urged mrs aquino to reconsider and close a painful chapter in 
our history 
early friday brig gen rodolfo biazon chief of the national 
capital region defense command ordered the alert in the manila 
area biazon reinforced security at all radio and television 
stations electric power plants telephone exchanges and other 
essential installations 
marcos supporters announced plans for a roman catholic mass and 
rally friday but there was no sign of trouble early friday marcos 
loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed attempts to 
topple mrs aquino since she took power feb 25 1986 after a 
popular uprising ended marcos 20year rule 
manila radio stations interrupted their programming to announce 
his death and the former presidents fellow northerners wept at 
the news manila newspapers bannered news of marcos death in 
fridays editions 
the national mood hinges on the question of forgiveness from 
both sides said the philippine daily inquirer in a frontpage 
editorial nothing less than the fate of the nation hinges on the 
storys resolution 
in a statement thursday mrs aquino expressed her condolences 
to marcos family but ruled out any burial in the philippines 
in the interest of the safety of those who will take the death 
of mr marcos in widely and passionately conflicting ways and for 
the tranquility of the state and the order of society the remains 
of ferdinand e marcos will not be allowed to be brought to our 
country until such time as the government be it under this 
administration or the succeeding one shall otherwise decide 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the federal aviation administration would seek to prevent any 
flight from carrying marcos body from the united states to the 
philippines 
one marcos supporter oliver lozano said loyalists would stage 
a symbolic funeral march to protest mrs aquinos decision but he 
did not say when 
marcos only son ferdinand marcos jr told manila television 
station gma that the family would try to persuade mrs aquino to 
change her mind nicanor yniguez former speaker of the national 
assembly called mrs aquinos refusal the height of sacrilege 
marcos death was announced after the close of the business day 
in the philippines and there was little public reaction to the 
passing of the man who ruled 21 years longer than any other 
filipino leader 
im not surprised said jazmine so 42 a manila merchant 
it was expected i dont know what will happen but the situation 
will not affect me 
in marcos home province of ilocos norte many wept at the news 
of his death 
it is painful but what can i do said ernie suarez a 
former soldier in batac 230 miles north of manila we wanted him 
back alive and we still want him to return now that hes dead 
our family cried when we heard about the news said gigi 
nalupta 29 in a telephone interview from batac we are sick at 
heart because we loved him very very much 
rolando abadilla vice governor of ilocos norte and marcos 
former police intelligence chief in manila said the former 
presidents supporters would exhaust all legal means to arrange 
his burial here but if that failed we will decide when the time 
comes on alternatives 
mrs aquino had refused to let marcos attend the funeral of his 
mother josefa edralinmarcos who died may 4 1988 or the burial 
of his sister elizabeth keon who died in december 1986 
mrs edralinmarcos body which has been embalmed several 
times remains in batac 
in manila vice president salvador laurel leader of the 
opposition nacionalista party and a leading marcos opponent urged 
mrs aquino to let marcos be buried at home 
the passing of former president marcos should now close a 
painful chapter in our history and put to rest all bitterness and 
rancor that have divided our people laurel said 
let us now strive to bring about national reconciliation 
which we failed to achieve during his lifetime 
sen juan ponce enrile also urged mrs aquino to change her 
mind enrile was marcos defense minister but then led the february 
1986 military mutiny that triggered the uprising that swept mrs 
aquino to power he was fired as defense minister nov 23 1986 
after a failed coup against mrs aquino by his followers 
i am calling on the president to allow him to return this 
would allow people who believed in the former president to give his 
due enrile said in a radio interview 
but senate president jovito salonga a longtime marcos opponent 
said he will support mrs aquinos decision 
in her statement mrs aquino said marcos rule changed our 
country 
in what ways he changed it i leave for now to others and 
ultimately to history to describe she said for at this moment 
of passage we must allow such a loss to transcend for his family 
politics and history and the opinions of men and women 
i personally condole deeply with the family he leaves behind 
with all sincerity for i and my children know the pain of such a 
loss 
mrs aquinos husband former sen benigno aquino was 
assassinated in august 1983 moments after he arrived at manilas 
airport to challenge marcos for leadership of the country he had 
been in selfimposed exile in the united states forty people 
mostly soldiers are on trial for his murder

despite a reputation as a tyrant and 
an embezzler friends recall ferdinand marcos as a brilliant 
charming man jealous of things that were his but with a soft spot 
for the welfare of his friends 
the 72yearold former president died thursday in a honolulu 
hospital of cardiac arrest 
i know he was a strongman recalled primitivo lovina an 
associate of marcos when the two served in the house of 
representatives but his greatest weakness was he had a soft 
heart for friends i think that caused his downfall 
conversations with former associates of marcos reveal a complex 
figure magnanimous and petty heroic and shallow 
apo was very very cordial and warm to us regardless of who 
you are recalled former marcos bodyguard romeo amansec 
referring to the former president by a filipino honorific for 
distinguished man 
amansec said marcos always told his employees that if they had 
any problems they were to go to his military chief of staff gen 
fabian ver 
if he cannot help you i will amansec quoted marcos as 
saying 
marcos was a study in contrast 
he was a brilliant student who topped the national bar 
examinations in 1939 but as president he flouted and manipulated 
the law to amass power and wealth 
marcos drafted grandiose plans for a new society to propel 
his impoverished nation into social justice and prosperity but 
under his new society his family and friends prospered at the 
expense of millions of his countrymen whose living standards 
plummeted 
the man who would in 1972 impose martial law and imprison 
thousands was also remembered as a passionate youth who courted 
women with roses and poems 
when it comes to women hes a gentleman he is like a sir 
walter raleigh he uses poetic language said lovina 
marcos charm was tempered with a passionate jealousy after he 
wooed and wed imelda romualdez in an 11day courtship in 1954 
lovina a former imelda suitor ran into the newlyweds in a manila 
theater 
i was with my girlfriend then and we said congratulations and 
best wishes lovina said i told meldy you didnt even tell 
me were getting married i just read it in the papers she said 
i also didnt expect it then you know what happened marcos 
pulled imeldas hand and dragged her away from us we were really 
surprised lovina said 
lovina who knew imelda before she met marcos never got in 
touch with her again for fear of offending her husband at a golf 
course several weeks later lovina and imelda stood beside each 
other like strangers in front of marcos but after marcos left for 
the clubhouse imelda turned to lovina and apologized 
more than 30 years later lovina visited the marcos family in 
their hawaiian exile he joked about the chilly reception he 
received during their meeting at the theater 
according to lovina marcos told him you had a reputation of 
being a playboy i was very young then 
friends recall marcos as a master political tactician who used 
imelda as one of his aces when all else failed during 
political campaigns imelda was always there to charm the crowds 
marcos always worked using three oplans operations plans 
said jesus quevenco a marcos lookalike who served as a 
standin for marcos during the runup to his 1965 election as 
president 
imelda was always the last resort quevenco said and that 
never fails 
in the final years of his presidency marcos faced several 
assassination attempts always according to former aides with 
aplomb 
amansec a former navy explosives expert recalls disarming 
several bombs including one at the manila folk arts center in 
1985 which he says could have leveled the building 
amansec now a hotel security guard said that when the 
president was told of the attempt marcos replied calmly is that 
so 
he got the brains the personality the leadership but i 
believe that he did not use them really properly lovina said 
had he done it we would have been the greatest nation in the 
world

brooklyn rivera leader of nicaraguas 
indian rebels returned home from exile thursday but said he does 
not know if his 3000 fighters will lay down their arms under a 
central american peace accord 
im coming to contribute in a positive way to advance an 
internal peace process in the country said rivera 37 who left 
nicaragua for costa rica in 1981 to lead an indian armed struggle 
the miskito leader head of the most populous tribe of 
nicaraguan indians now heads the yatama organization that groups 
miskito sumo and rama indians and three groups of blacks of west 
indian descent living on the caribbean coast 
at the airport rivera signed papers required of all returning 
exiles saying he wants to join the civic process by accepting 
amnesty 
yatama maintains it is not covered by a peace agreement signed 
by five central american presidents on aug 7 that calls for 
nicaraguas other rebels the usbacked contras to disband and 
relocate from honduran camps 
rivera said 2000 indian combatants remain in the coast region 
and another 1000 in honduras the yatama coalition fought 
alongside the contras and like them used to received us 
military aid and still receives nonlethal aid 
what will be done with those selfdefense forces is still not 
decided said rivera 
he said he belongs to no political party because the 
government in bad faith stopped me from returning to the country 
last june imposing what he called a series of absurd 
conditions that included agreement not to form indian political 
parties in the coastal region 
that condition he said was meant to delay or prevent creation 
of a political organization to represent interests of atlantic 
coast ethnic groups miskitos account for 130000 of the 275000 
members of six ethnic groups in the region 
rivera said they could take part in the electoral process either 
by voting in their own regional authorities or through political 
parties that would represent their land and autonomy interests 
he is too late to register as the deadline for political parties 
was sept 8 and candidates have to register by friday 
residents of the thinly settled caribbean coast have resisted 
efforts to bring their communities under control of the central 
government both by the sandinistas and the somoza family rulers 
the sandinistas ousted in 1979 
an autonomy plan approved by the government in 1988 does not 
satisfy the communitys needs he said

president bush welcomed colombian president 
virgilio barco to the white house on thursday evening with praise 
for barcos crackdown on drug traffickers and assurances of help to 
improve trade to support colombias economy 
however there was no movement to help raise the price of coffee 
colombias major legal export and the subject of dispute between 
the two countries rising from us attacks on international price 
supports 
at the meeting which stretched from the originally scheduled 
halfhour to about 1 hours bush indicated his intention to work 
closely with president barco to expand bilateral trade and 
investment opportunities in order to spur colombias economic 
growth white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement 
bush said he had asked us trade representative carla hills 
to lead an interagency effort to examine urgently what can be 
done to improve trade benefits according to fitzwater 
us officials have said trade concessions are being considered 
for some colombian exports such as flowers and textiles another 
possibility is providing inducements for us private investment in 
colombia 
but on coffee bush only reiterated that the united states is 
prepared to resume talks with colombia and others on renewal of the 
international coffee agreement fitzwater said 
last week bush rejected a plea by barco for a oneyear 
reinstatement of a coffeeexport quota system that had helped 
colombian farmers 
world coffee prices have fallen by about a third sharply since 
the 74nation cartel suspended export quotas after the united 
states backed by some central american countries who wanted larger 
quotas blocked a new agreement in july 
colombian officials have suggested it will be difficult to keep 
farmers from switching from coffee to coca most cocaine entering 
the united states is grown in peru and bolivia and processed in 
colombia where the major cocaine gangs are based 
another issue raised at the meeting was us drug consumption 
which barco has long criticized as the fuel supporting the violent 
drug traffickers who plague his country 
the two presidents talked about the domestic drug problem in 
the united states and the administrations efforts to reduce 
consumption fitzwater said 
the colombian president making his first visit to washington 
since launching the crackdown on drug traffickers last month told 
reporters before the meeting that he was seeking no additional 
financial help in his countrys battle against traffickers 
we have received help with our problem barco said 
referring to 65 million in emergency assistance from the united 
states during a photo session with bush in the white house rose 
garden 
bush expressed appreciation on the part of the american 
people for barcos efforts to combat drug traffickers but he 
declined to say during the photo session what help the united 
states might provide on trade matters 
participants in the white house meeting included national drug 
policy director william j bennett attorney general dick 
thornburgh national security advisor brent scowcroft white house 
chief of staff john h sununu and deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger 
barco met earlier thursday with bennett under tight security at 
the colombian ambassadors home 
at that meeting bennett said later barco raised various 
issues including trade matters such as coffee and cut flowers but 
bennett declined to provide details of the help barco wants 
saying we were mainly there to listen 
during a meeting with members of the house barco raised the 
issue of us assaultstyle weapons being smuggled into his country 
for use by drug traffickers said rep charles rangel dny 
chairman of the house select committee on narcotics abuse 
barco stressed not only the need for americans to reduce their 
consumption of cocaine but also the manufacture of automatic 
weapons that are being distributed in international markets that 
are killing his people rangel said 
bennett said he and barco had discussed this problem at an 
earlier meeting but the colombian president did not raise it again 
today 
its a matter im concerned about bennett said adding that 
he had spoken with stephen higgins the director of the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms who assured me there will be more 
attention paid to this more resources more of his people are 
going to be one this 
the bush administration has banned the import of assault rifles 
but has not acted against domestic manufacture of such weapons 
among other subjects raised by barco with the house members were 
his concerns over the manufacture of chemicals used to process 
cocaine foreign mercenaries and laundering of drug money 
he emphasized that while he didnt need troops he needed a 
lot of help in these other areas rangel said 
barco ordered emergency measures to crack down on the drug 
traffickers after the aug 18 assassination of leading presidential 
candidate luis carlos galan an outspoken foe of the drug trade 
those measures including the resumption of extradition to the 
united states of suspected drug traffickers prompted the 
traffickers to declare total war on the government they have 
set off bombs killed several people at the bogota airport and 
vowed to kill 10 judges for every trafficker extradited 
since 1981 about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been 
killed and judges this year have repeatedly walked off the job or 
threatened to strike over a lack of security colombias former 
justice minister monica de greiff resigned last week after 
receiving numerous death threats 
bennett said he stressed to barco that american public opinion 
was strongly behind what he is doing americans salute his courage 
his resolution his bravery and the bravery and resoluteness of the 
colombian people

rolling stones guitarist keith richards said he 
kicked his heroin addiction because his children were exposed to 
repeated police raids 
i was on the run all the time richards said about his 
drugtaking in the 1970s when he lived with german actress anita 
pallenberg and their two children 
my kids were growing up getting used to letting in hordes of 
policemen there was a knock at the door is it room service or is 
it the cops he told british broadcasting corp radio in a new 
york interview to be broadcast here next month 
the group is on a north american concert tour 
richards 45 known as the wildest rolling stone also 
admitted he feared being sent to prison 
the funny thing with that stuff is that you dont particularly 
notice it until it comes to a huge head richards said in 
canada i guess i realized this could not go on any more this had 
to stop 
richards was charged with heroin trafficking in toronto in 1977 
and escaped a heavy jail sentence by agreeing to a free concert for 
the blind and treatment for his addiction 
i cant even imagine it now some of the things i used to go 
through with that stuff he said

an important opposition leader broke 
away from a 14party coalition thursday further weakening a 
fractious bloc that seeks to unseat the ruling sandinistas in next 
years elections 
mauricio diaz president of the peoples social christian party 
said he was leaving the national opposition union uno because 
leftist parties in the coalition had too much power 
however an official of uno told the associated press that 
highranking members of diazs party had denied there was a split 
in ranks 
unos political council is in session right now and the 
executive commission of the peoples social christian party is in 
the meeting uno spokesman luis sanchez said thursday evening 
after diaz announced his decision at a news conference 
they insist that the party as such will maintain itself within 
uno and that if diaz is breaking away hes doing so on his own 
sanchez added 
violeta barrios de chamorro publisher of the opposition 
newspaper la prensa and virgilio godoy are the uno presidential 
and vice presidential candidates for the feb 25 elections 
mrs chamorro and godoy are running against president daniel 
ortega and vice president sergio ramirez of the leftist sandinista 
national liberation front which has been in power for a decade 
diaz told reporters his party would support erick ramirez the 
presidential candidate of the splinter social christian party 
diazs party has six deputies in the national assembly the 
thirdlargest opposition party in the countrys single chamber 
legislature 
apparently the split came when uno was discussing how to 
apportion candidacies among its 14 parties for the 90 seats in the 
national assembly 
according to the nicaraguan constitution the assembly has 90 
seats based on the last census estimate but defeated presidential 
candidates are guaranteed one seat each apart from uno and the 
sandinista front at least six parties are running presidential 
candidates 
the current national assembly has 96 deputies as six parties 
apart from the sandinista front ran presidential candidates in the 
1984 elections 
the deadline for registering candidates at all levels is friday 
diaz said uno offered his party two deputies candidacies while 
the communist and socialist parties were offered six seats each he 
said this was incongruent because his party was the fourth largest 
votegetter in the 1984 elections while the communists were fifth 
and the socialists sixth 
leftist parties within uno have too much influence and great 
power diaz said at the news conference sitting next to ramirez 
the choice of godoy as the vice presidential candidate four 
weeks ago created a crisis in uno because some parties favored a 
rightist businessman the crisis was finally resolved and godoy was 
accepted but not before some parties had threatened to break away 
the leadership of godoys party the independent liberal also 
has been having internal power struggles 
uno members 12 legally registered parties and two splinter 
groups bickered for weeks over the procedure for apportioning the 
deputies slots and were still discussing the matter less than 24 
hours before the deadline for registering them

when frustrated stuntman karel 
soucek became the first person in 23 years to take the plunge over 
niagara falls in a barrel in 1984 he proclaimed himself the last 
of the niagara daredevils 
but the czechborn canadian soucek was no prophet on wednesday 
canadians peter debernardi and jeffrey petkovich became the third 
and fourth men to accomplish the stunt since souceks ride and the 
first duo to ever go over the falls together 
perhaps karel souceks success motivates them niagara parks 
police chief wilfred j derbyshire said thursday of the increase of 
attempts during this decade 
overall 12 adventurers have gone over the falls in a barrel 
nine have survived the 176foot plunge five men have gone over the 
falls in the 1980s a record for one decade 
derbyshire said the increase of successful attempts can be 
partly attributed to the proximity of recent launches to the shore 
with a short stretch of river before the infamous drop the 
barrels often stay clear of most rocks hidden under the cascading 
water 
the hightech construction of the barrels derbyshire admitted 
is probably most responsible for the successful attempts 
debernardi solicited 50000 from local businesses to construct 
the barrel and had planned the stunt and the construction of the 
barrel since the spring of 1988 
the two survived the voyage with minor cuts and no serious 
injuries 
were we scared petkovich 25 said what for theres no 
doubt that id do it again no sweat 
debernardi 42 was more reserved its something i always 
wanted to do its a challenge its the greatest stunt in the 
world and im glad to be alive 
the romanticized stunt has been performed for different reasons 
since annie edson taylor became the first to survive the plunge on 
oct 24 1901 
some did it for profit like red hill jr who died performing 
the stunt in 1951 to raise money for a memorial to his father a 
famous riverman along the niagara 
others like soucek and steven trotter who went over in 1985 
did it in an attempt to bolster their careers as stuntmen 
petkovich and debernardi however said their motivation was to 
show kids there is an alternative to drugs 
if you can make that connection youve got a better 
imagination than me retorted dennis schafer general manager of 
the niagara parks commission 
petkovich and debernardi were charged with unlawfully performing 
a stunt in the park which carries a fine of 500 debernardi also 
faces an additional 1000 fine for trespassing after he was warned 
18 months ago not to perform the stunt 
derbyshire and schafer said the parks commission will be on the 
lookout for attempts in the near future 
it is not whether you fail or triumph reads the inscription 
on the grave of soucek who died six months after his falls stunt 
during a barrel drop in the houston astrodome its that you keep 
your word and at least try

memory is playing tricks on southern 
californians who think the current smog siege is any worse than 
usual experts said thursday 
the dirty browntinted air that has prompted firststage smog 
alerts in some areas this week is a seasonal tradition said 
claudia keith of the south coast air quality management district 
i think people kind of forgot what its like here now ms 
keith said we had strange weather last week foggy and rainy 
and they thought fall had started we sort of got a resurgence of 
summer this week 
a mild august with relatively cool lowsmog days also may have 
lulled southern californians into a false sense of security she 
said the smog season traditionally runs from may to october 
forecaster bob grebe of the national weather service concurred 
september is hot and smoggy in southern california grebe 
said thursday atmospheric conditions create an inversion layer 
that works to trap pollutants he said 
contributing to the burning eyes and breathing problems that 
smog inflicts is a buildup of nitrogen dioxide that is common in 
the fall ms keith said 
the pollutant stems primarily from vehicle emissions and without 
summers strong sun to burn it off it just sticks in the air 
she said nitrogen dioxide is responsible for the browntinged look 
of southern california skies 
it was very smoggy this week theres no doubt about it ms 
keith conceded on top of that there was the nitrogen dioxide so 
it was a double whammy 
in 1989 overall there were somewhat fewer smog alerts than in 
years past ms keith said 
mostly that was because we had such a good august with 
nature lending a hand by providing favorable weather conditions 
she said 
id love to say it was because no one was driving but i 
cant she added 
fiftytwo firststage smog alerts were declared this year after 
the pollution index rose above 200 parts per million there were no 
secondstage alerts which ms keith said are rare in any year 
the district advises children and the elderly to curtail 
activities and remain indoors during a firststage smog alert

the fund that has helped millions of americans 
buy homes with fha mortgages is in the red for the first time in 
history and will need up to 5 billion from congress over the next

most of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically

payments the head of the general accounting office told a senate 
panel wednesday 
gao chief charles a bowsher said the muchpublicized problems 
of waste and mismanagement at the department of housing and urban

the nations biggest geothermal 
complex is literally running out of steam casting doubts on a 
clean technology that had been the very symbol of alternative 
energy 
during the past year the geysers a 30squaremile region in 
the isolated mountains 90 miles north of san francisco has seen 
steam pressure drop at a rate much faster than expected 
the decline is so dramatic it eventually could halve electricity 
production at the 28plant site which is owned by several 
utilities according to state energy commission chairman charles 
imbrecht 
that could cost the companies hundreds of millions of dollars 
imbrecht said california taxpayers also stand to lose millions 
because the state collects royalties that are tied to electricity 
or steam production 
worldwide there are 67 geothermal fields producing electricity 
or under development to make power the rest of the industry is 
keeping a close eye on how companies cope with the problems at the 
geysers because of the fields size and nearly 30year operating 
history said john mock of the us energy department

the basement room is sparsely furnished just a 
battered dresser two chairs a couch that converts to a bed and a 
faded yellow carpet covering a concrete floor 
but the humble trappings of leszeks room belie his status as a 
future member of the economic elite in his native poland 
i want to build a house in poland so here i have to work to 
make the money said leszek who like other poles interviewed 
spoke on condition that his surname not be used 
leszek pronounced leshek is one of thousands of poles who 
have fled the deteriorating economic situation in their homeland 
where even staples such as bread and milk are often missing from 
shops 
in 1988 of the 63500 poles who entered the united states as 
tourists about 14000 stayed longer than their visas permitted 
us immigration and naturalization service figures show tourist 
visas usually are valid from three to nine months 
a higher percentage of poles illegally overstay their visas than 
residents of any other major country said ins researcher robert 
warren 
that number has fallen from 22000 since 1986 the year a new 
immigration law mandating penalties for employers who hire illegal 
aliens went into effect 
but the number of poles illegally working here is still 
considerable said ins spokesman carl henderson in chicago where 
the majority of such poles end up polish restaurants and shops 
abound in this city and poles can get by with learning a minimum 
of english 
at polands consulate in chicago viceconsul robert michniewicz 
acknowledged with the economic situation in poland people are 
all wanting to get out and earn easy money 
but he added most of them want to come here just to make some 
dollars and then go back 
wages at even menial jobs here far outstrip earnings in poland 
where monthly salaries average about 15 at the legal black market 
exchange rate 
what i make here in a week it would take me a year to earn in 
poland said jadwiga who earns 275 weekly for taking care of an 
ailing woman here 
even so the 48yearold research chemist noted it would 
never come into my head to leave poland forever life in poland is 
very hard but i dont want to be a foreigner all my life 
and with dollars or west german marks in hand a pole can afford 
what many of his or her countrymen can only dream about luxuries 
such as a telephone a car even an apartment 
for other poles working abroad is simply a matter of survival 
i had to come here said marta a high school teacher in 
poland who has taken care of an elderly man in a chicago suburb 
since the fall of 1987 
marta 40 entered the united states on a tourist visa leaving 
her 14yearold daughter at home with the girls grandparents 
she said she plans to return with some 15000 which she says 
she will put in an interestbearing dollar account in a polish bank 
to supplement her salary so she can put food on the table 
ive paid a certain psychological price but theres a 
positive side to it too marta said my daughter says she 
misses me but she understands we need the money 
for many immigrants the price of american wages can be high 
they do the hardest and dirtiest jobs said michniewicz the 
vice consul 
people are living six to a basement and working two or three 
jobs 
although leszek as a miner in poland could earn three times 
the average salary that sum is still paltry when compared with the 
5 an hour he can earn doing odd jobs at construction sites in 
chicago 
in his quest for a better life leszek who is 37 but looks 
older left behind his wife and two daughters 
he plans on staying in the united states for about 18 months 
working a year in germany previously allowed him to pay the 2300 
cost of his trip here and to buy a car 
in his basement room leszek looks out the window at the tires 
of passing cars then shows off pictures of his wife and children 
in their polish home 
here its such a wild life everybodys running after 
money he said at home we have time to go to the sea or to the 
mountains here theyre working from morning to night

on east berlins busy leipziger strasse is a 
poster showing an attractive young woman in a communist youth 
uniform waving joyously in celebration of east germanys 40th 
anniversary 
but the cheery poster plastered up at key points throughout the 
city comes nowhere near reflecting the mood of the country as it 
observes its founding on oct 7 1949 
east germany today is beset by widespread discontent and people 
have been fleeing by the tens of thousands even though its economy 
is the envy of the rest of the east bloc 
we need a pluralistic socialist democracy and we need it 
now said the rev friedrich schorlemmer a lutheran church 
pastor in wittenberg who calls often for democratic reforms his 
comment is more in line with the mood of a growing number of 
todays east germans 
challenged by a determined democracy movement reeling from the 
exodus to the west and facing apparent disunity within its own 
ranks the governing communist party will be hard put to give the 
world a show of success on its 40th anniversary 
east germanys problems have drawn attention to the governments 
vulnerability as an opponent of a democracy mood that has swept 
across other parts of eastern europe 
hardline communists have firmly rejected the kind of democratic 
reforms under way in the soviet union hungary and poland 
east germany does not need reform just for the sake of reform 
we solve our own problems through the achievements of our 
workers said otto reinhold head of the staterun academy for 
social sciences in east germany 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union plans to be 
in east berlin for the anniversary celebrations but even this 
gesture of camaraderie could serve to remind the east german 
leadership of its troubles 
gorbachev is wellliked by many east germans who see his reforms 
at home as a good example to follow and his presence could nudge 
east germanys leader the 77yearold erich honecker into seeing 
the necessity for democratic reforms 
honecker himself has become a source of speculation 
particularly since he underwent a gall bladder operation and took 
six weeks to recover the illness raised the questions of how much 
longer he would remain in power and who his successor would be 
east german activists say they fear violent demonstrations could 
erupt across east germany if the countrys aging hardline 
leadership does not give some hope for change to a people growing 
increasingly restless 
the most dramatic manifestation of discontent so far has been 
the exodus of more than 20000 east german refugees to the west 
since sept 11 when hungary opened its borders for them bringing 
the total for the year so far to at least 100000 
the vast majority said they left in search of democratic 
freedoms and better living conditions 
that too is a sentiment among many of the east germans who 
have stayed behind and signed up with new democracymovement groups 
the most prominent of these groups the recently banned neues 
forum new forum says it signed up more than 4000 supporters in 
about two weeks 
on sept 25 about 8000 people marched through leipzig 
demanding more democracy and singing we shall overcome police 
arrested about a dozen of them 
the wave of democracy sentiment has produced apparent fissures 
within the communist party itself 
hans modrow communist party chief for dresden indicated he 
sees a need for change when he said during a recent visit to 
stuttgart in west germany that the government in east berlin should 
think about the causes of the east german exodus 
but the countrys leaders have given no sign of abandoning their 
antireforms stance 
as the 40th anniversary approached staterun publications ran 
articles emphasizing east germanys ideological links with 
communist allies from moscow to beijing as well as its business 
ties with the west 
as for the exodus the east german leadership has charged that 
west germany lured people away 
the staterun publications also have been portraying east 
germany as a land of hard workers devoted to communism 
the communist party ostseezeitung newspaper recently quoted the 
supervisor of a collective farm manfred steller as saying when 
i look around then i start to think how much things have changed 
in the past 20 years back then we were hauling sacks out of wagons 
by hand but now we have a huge fleet of transport vehicles there 
have been some problems along the way but weve mastered them 
all 
indeed east germany has achieved a standard of living that is 
the envy of many of its east bloc neighbors but it remains far 
below west germany which sends financial aid and it still has 
enormous problems with air and water pollution struggles with 
frequent shortages of fresh fruits and vegetables and faces a 
serious lack of building materials and construction labor 
east germany was officially founded 40 years ago with soviet 
backing like west germany it was created from the wartime rubble 
of adolf hitlers nazi germany 
it quickly became a focal point of the cold war and in 1961 its 
leaders built the berlin wall creating one of the worlds starkest 
and deadliest symbols of the divisions between east and west 
the wall still stands starkly 40 years after the birth of east 
germany but maybe less deadly 
honecker said earlier this year border guards had been told not 
to shoot at escapees anymore except in selfdefense or to stop 
desertions

thousands of ethnic turks line up daily 
at the turkish embassy in sofia besieging officials for visas to 
enter turkey but about 20000 who got visas in past months have 
come back unable to find good jobs or housing in turkey 
the turks have been fleeing a sometimesviolent campaign by 
bulgarian authorities going back to 1984 to force them to use 
bulgarian names curtail their moslem religious rites and stop 
speaking turkish in public 
diplomats in sofia say many of the turks who have returned face 
prosecution although they have no details of such cases they also 
say the turks often are forbidden to return to their previous jobs 
and homes partly due to an acute labor shortage in some areas that 
has prompted authorities to shift manual labor to crucial 
construction projects and industries 
the official bulgarian news agency bta has reported the return 
rate at 500 to 1000 a day 
a turkish diplomat in sofia said however that ethnic turks 
still want to leave bulgaria as vigorously as before 
you can see for yourself there are some 2000 people waiting 
around our consulate every day he said 
about 320000 of bulgarias 15 million ethnic turks began in 
midyear to leave for turkey bulgaria deported some of them 
others emigrated under new liberalized passport regulations many 
had their possessions seized before leaving and their arrival 
strained turkish abilities to absorb them 
on aug 22 premier turgut ozal of turkey closed the border to 
the ethnic turks requiring them to obtain regular visas his move 
part of an attempt to persuade bulgaria to safeguard the property 
of those seeking to settle in turkey was widely seen as a 
diplomatic victory for bulgarias communist government over turkey 
which had asserted at one point that it would welcome any bulgarian 
turk facing persecution 
now that turkey is no longer absorbing large new groups of 
ethnic turks the situation of people wanting to emigrate has 
become even more precarious about 25000 wouldbe emigrants are 
stranded in bulgaria most have sold their houses and other 
belongings 
a turkish diplomat said his mission now is to issue visas only 
for family reunification and other urgent cases 
in all we are interviewing about 800 people a day he said 
only a handful perhaps a dozen or so receive visas each day 
with the numbers we have given out for visa applicants we are 
already in the mid1990s he said of a waiting list for 
interviews 
long lines reportedly also have formed outside the turkish 
consulates in varna on the black sea and the southern industrial 
town of plovdiv 
several diplomats in sofia asserted that 500000 more ethnic 
turks may want to emigrate to turkey 
but bulgaria continues to balk at a new emigration accord with 
turkey that would set out in detail such things as property rights 
and social security claims 
such a new immigration agreement would limit the free movement 
of our people under the helsinki accords on human rights said 
chavdar mladenov of the foreign ministry bulgaria has come under 
heavy western criticism over the issue 
officially bulgaria has stopped referring to a turkish minority 
in the country officials and newspapers now invariably speak of

he negotiates on behalf of exiled miskito 
indians in nicaragua he storms out of a tabulation center to 
denounce election fraud in panama 
he sits down with warring ethiopian factions in atlanta to 
arrange peace talks he meets with president bush in the oval 
office to report his hopes for a fair nicaraguan election 
eight years after he left the white house in humiliating defeat 
jimmy carter who brought arab and jew together in the historic 
negotiations at camp david is back in business as a mediator 
not since herbert hoovers globegirdling activities in famine 
relief and his recommendations on streamlining the government has 
an expresident taken so active and visible a role in public 
affairs 
carter and his wife rosalynn also take tools in hand to work 
on projects for habitat for humanity a georgiabased organization 
in which volunteers build homes for the needy from new yorks lower 
east side to uganda 
all of this activity comes at a time of renewed interest in 
former presidents with four of them on the scene at once for the 
first time since early in the lincoln administration and a 
conference on the subject scheduled for oct 1819 at the hoover 
library in west branch iowa 
i do think that our expresidents are supposed to do more than 
play golf hoover biographer vaughn davis bornet said in an 
interview they are supposed to have been so interested in public 
affairs at one time that they are not supposed to give up that 
interest 
carter has certainly not given it up 
he has traveled frequently and been host to current and former 
world leaders at the carter presidential center his atlanta public 
policy facility and think tank 
after nine days of preliminary talks at the center he announced 
last month that the ethiopian government and eritrean rebels had 
agreed to begin formal negotiations in nairobi on a settlement of 
their 28yearlong conflict carter will serve as cochairman 
playing much the same role he did in the talks between israels 
menachem begin and egypts anwar sadat in 1978 at camp david the 
presidential retreat in the catoctins 
also last month on a trip to nicaragua as head of a delegation 
that will monitor elections there in february he successfully 
negotiated with the leftist sandinista government for the return of 
rebel miskito indian leader brooklyn rivera after years of exile in 
costa rica 
carter went to panama in may as an election observer from the 
unofficial council of freely elected heads of government at a 
tabulation center he said he found officials tabulating 
counterfeit tally sheets so he stalked out and denounced the 
countrys election as rigged for the handpicked candidate of gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
why all this activity 
carter i think is making every effort to erase an impression 
that he thinks people have of him said bornet a professor 
emeritus of history at southern oregon college and in that he is 
absolutely at one with herbert hoover hoover really worked at 
that 
robert strauss the former democratic national chairman who 
managed carters unsucessful reelection campaign disagreed about 
the former presidents motives 
i suspect that jimmy carter is oblivious to what people like 
me are very sensitive to and that is the fact that the public is 
beginning to reexamine him a bit strauss said i have a 
feeling of great confidence that jimmy carter as a person is going 
to be viewed better and better i dont think its a reexamination 
of his presidency i think its taking another look at jimmy 
carter 
john milton cooper a professor of history at the university of 
wisconsin who described himself as a good democrat said 
however we remember all those old hoover commission reports and 
things but in terms of its translating much to the public it 
didnt do that with hoover and i dont think its doing that much 
with carter either 
whatever the motives scholars generally gave carter 64 better 
marks than the other three former presidents richard nixon and 
gerald ford both 76 and and ronald reagan 78 
i am inclined by what i know not to say that mr ford has done 
the best he can with what hes got i dont think hes been a major 
figure said bornet 
the hoover scholars also said that reagan who has spent much of 
his time since jan 20 on highly paid speaking tours has made a 
few missteps gould said its a little hard to see what 
reagans postpresidency is going to be 
bornet said he thought nixon with his articles and books on 
foreign policy has done more than could possibly be expected 
after being driven from office by the watergate scandal 
however donald mccoy a university of kansas historian said 
that while people now pay attention to nixon i just dont 
think people are going to forget and forgive the circumstances of 
his departure 
carter and hoover are the only presidents in this century to be 
defeated for reelection both were engineers more noted for their 
grasp of detail than their power to sway audiences both were 
vanquished by slick political operators hoover by franklin d 
roosevelt and carter by ronald reagan 
when hoover left office in 1933 the country was in the grips of 
deepening economic depression carter relinquished the white house 
in 1981 bedeviled by the hostage crisis in iran a sagging economy 
and peoples memories of waiting in long lines for gasoline 
roosevelt ignored hoover but president harry truman named him 
chairman of the famine emergency commission after world war ii and 
he headed commissions on government reorganization under both 
truman and president dwight d eisenhower 
neither reagan nor president bush is known to have called on 
carter for any substantive governmental missions but carter has 
acted on his own 
he said in may i think if i had an official role to play it 
might hamper my freedom and limit greatly what influence or access 
i do have 
he has outlived his high negatives louis gould a professor 
of history at the university of texas and student of the 
presidency said in an interview 
it took herbert hoover a long time carter has been doing it 
more quickly said mccoy who will join gould and cooper at the 
west branch conference cosponsored by the hoover and ford 
presidential libraries 
what makes carter unique is the sense that he has really 
improved his national standing with the conduct of his 
postpresidency and that is to some degree i think making 
historical perceptions of his presidency a little more favorable 
said gould

laurie anderson became americas bestknown 
performance artist in the early 1980s and unlike some avantgarde 
artists with whom the mainstream catches up shes still 
avantgarde 
she opens the brooklyn academy of musics next wave festival on 
tuesday with a piece called empty places which she premiered 
this year at the spoleto festival in charleston sc 
empty places has anderson on stage singing without a band 
screens on two 20foot towers show computercontrolled slides and 
film images range from grim homelessness to bluebirds of happiness 
i love the way pictures and music can be made to work 
together anderson said 
its never one of my goals to be a cuttingedge artist i 
think of myself working in the worlds oldest art form 
storytelling theres nothing new about that the trick is how do 
you tell a good story 
i suppose my goal in empty places is to describe how much 
the world seems to me to have changed in the last few years it 
tries to describe suffering and peoples ideas of utopia she 
said 
this is going to look very different than things ive done 
before i have absolutely no interest in whether theyre 
avantgarde or not of course artists dont want to bore people and 
its important to invent things i love things that are surprising 
and shocking i actually consider it a kind of responsibility to do 
things not in a usual way 
a new laurie anderson record strange angels which she 
worked on for two years will be released by warner bros on oct 
24 seven of its songs are in empty places anderson will tour 
the show starting in december in canada returning to the united 
states in february 
she has changed the show since spoleto 
there were a few headscratchers in there she said i 
love things that are puzzling in good ways i had to take out a 
couple that were just plain puzzling i kind of ripped the whole 
show apart 
then she got sick and spent time visiting doctors i went to 
rio to do a concert there were eight people in my group from 
eating fish quite a few of us got one of these strange new poison 
ocean diseases that nobody knows very much about and cant fix very 
easily i got the version of being completely dizzy were all a 
lot better than we were 
im putting the show back together it is becoming a lot more 
political than it was before the more i look around and also try 
to understand what this particular piece is about the angrier i 
get mostly with things that not too many people seem to be really 
talking about 
everybody in new york knows what its like to walk out and see 
six people lying in their little sidewalk dormitory it was just so 
odd that nobody talked about that in a coherent way in the last 
elections you look around at the eight years that reagan created 
and it is so horrifying to see the results of this rampant gimme 
gimme economy she said 
im really trying to look at that from a few different angles 
im in the midst of redefining the introduction it is places that 
ive shot pictures of mostly in downtown new york theyre not 
exactly ruins but they look like it 
that has been one of the nicest things about working on this 
piece anderson said i go out at night a lot real late and 
shoot a lot of places ive shot thousands of things for this 
piece slides moving images and films that were sent through a 
visual digital computer and look very grainy its a beautiful look 
stories work so much better at night and these arent exactly 
bedtime stories i find some of them kind of horrifying people 
have drifted into the shots its a whole different world from 
midnight on out there its making me feel at home in new york in a 
way i never have before 
the show also has some cheery animation i was trying to make 
a real cartoon with all these screens i thought i need some 
disneytype bluebirds bluebirds make me happy i drew them on the 
computer with picket fences and roses there are songs about 
utopia 
are they ironic 
some of them are some arent she replied irony is a 
really tricky thing i try to use irony sparingly im doing a lot 
more singing in this show i find i can say ironic things but i 
cant sing ironic things 
the other big difference in this show is that ive been taking 
singing lessons three years this is the first performance where 
im trying to use that to my shock i discovered i was a soprano i 
thought id be a low alto when you sing high its a very 
vulnerable feeling and you really have to believe what youre 
singing thats not to say some of these songs arent silly and 
preposterous 
there are fewer computerized filters changing my voice im 
trying very hard to be truthful sometimes thats not very clever 
and i dont mind that its not these things dont have triple and 
quadruple meanings they have one meaning 
anderson performed her sixhour united states parts i iv 
at the 1983 next wave festival her last big performing tour was in 
1986

some good theater songs just disappear they 
vanish because they are in flop musicals or are overshadowed in hit 
shows by more persistent melodies 
now theres an attempt to resurrect a dozen or so mostly 
forgotten treasures in a new polygram release by sarah brightman 
called the songs that got away produced by her husband andrew 
lloyd webber 
it was one of lloyd webbers own unknown efforts half a 
moment that led to the recording says brightman the song 
which has lyrics by british playwright alan ayckbourn is from 
jeeves a rare lloyd webber failure that ran for only 48 
performances in londons west end in 1975 
brightman who starred in the london and new york productions of 
the phantom of the opera sang the song as an encore during a 
concert she gave in england in 1987 
the audience went mad about it and then it happened twice 
again during two more concerts she recalled during an interview 
i thought there must be a lot of lost songs like this one 
so did lloyd webber and thomas z shepard a veteran new york 
record producer who has made many of the best original cast albums 
from company to la cage aux folles to find the songs the 
two men culled their extensive record collections of theater music 
and started sorting out songs with brightman 
we kept writing down different lists and from there narrowed 
it down to about 100 songs and finally to 14 she said 
the recording was made after brightman completed her run on 
broadway in phantom an engagement she got through with grace 
and good humor after actors equity made noises about not letting 
her appear in her husbands show because they thought the role 
should go to an american 
i didnt feel part of it in a funny sort of way she said 
i just got on with my role as well as i could after all im a 
working artist and the public came and paid their money to see me 
do my thing 
the final selections for the recording include littleknown 
works of such wellknown composers as richard rodgers leonard 
bernstein stephen sondheim and marvin hamlisch 
bernsteins calysotinged luds wedding from 1600 
pennsylvania avenue a sevenperformance flop about the occupants 
of the white house suggests the shows failure was due to its 
lugubrious book rather than bersteins eclectic music that had 
lyrics by alan jay lerner 
rodgers is represented by two works i am going to like it 
here an affecting lesson in confidencebuilding from flower 
drum song and away from you a soaring love song with lyrics 
by sheldon harnick from their 1976 collaboration about henry viii 
called rex 
when brightman recorded mister monotony it was a cult 
irving berlin song cut first from his miss liberty and then 
from call me madam since then it has found a home and a 
wide audience in jerome robbins broadway 
the most unusual selection is frank loessers three cornered 
tune which was an early version of his famous fugue for 
tinhorns from guys and dolls 
now instead of extolling the joys of betting on the horses 
brightman in threevoice harmony trills a sweet number about a 
tender sound this little tune i found 
most of the recording was done in london and vienna with several 
different orchestrators although dreamers a song from marvin 
hamlischs shortlived musical jean seberg was done in new 
york 
marvin wanted to use his own musicians and to conduct it 
himself he did it beautifully giving the song sort of a baroque 
quality brightman said 
much of her fall will be occupied with the music of andrew 
lloyd webber a concert tour featuring her husbands music done 
by soloists and a symphony orchestra brightman wont appear in all 
the cities on the tour but will sing in some of the major stops 
like los angeles 
she also is working on a television project tentative title 
shooting star about the life of jessie matthews the british 
musical comedy star known in the united states primarily for her 
recording of a rodgers and hart classic dancing on the ceiling 
she was a wonderful performer brightman said she nearly 
got the first ginger rogers role with fred astaire but lost it 
because she was contracted to do a musical on broadway and they 
wouldnt let her out of it 
her whole life was like that for america there always was 
something that nearly came up and was taken away from her so she 
was only a very big star in britain and australia now i have a 
chance to make her better known

at last count a woman had 187 belts crammed into 
closets and stuffed into drawers most of them never worn and 
hardly even looked at 
a man thinks only the most expensive exercise bicycle will help 
enhance his physique never mind that he already owns a battery of 
bodybuilding equipment that he doesnt use 
such people are compulsive spending addicts and therapists at a 
new york psychiatric treatment center take the affliction as 
seriously as the problems of alcoholics and drug abusers 
they think that owning things makes them feel better says 
dr francesca kress director of psychological assessment at the 
hapworth centers located an easy browsing distance from the citys 
fifth avenue shopping mecca 
as their lives become more and more of a disaster they will 
treat themselves to something they cant afford says kress 
adding that maybe at the back of a buying fanatics mind is the 
thought mommy and daddy gave me presents and it made me feel 
better 
not everyone who occasionally splurges suffers from the 
addiction but people who use shopping to salve troubled minds 
might need help 
when material objects are used as a way to assuage feelings of 
discomfort theres a problem according to kress who treats 
addicts at hapworths compulsive spending addiction program 
from bargain hunters who scour discount outlets to wellheeled 
patrons of chic boutiques who think it is beneath them to buy 
anything on sale compulsive spending addiction takes many forms 
a person might develop the syndrome for any number of reasons 
there is the case of a patient who as a child was given gifts 
when being told of divorce plans the parents planted the mistaken 
notion that presents make difficulties go away or at least make 
distress easier to bear which might have caused abnormal spending 
desires when the child grew up kress suggests 
rather than deal with a problem they think that they can go 
out and buy something to make themselves feel better she says 
the phenomenon of people living beyond their means or being 
obsessed with possessions probably has been around as long as 
people have cultures that revere wealth have turned the 
acquisition habit into an accepted measure of selfworth and 
personal success 
in modern times explosive growth in credit card ownership has 
made it easier for people to indulge their spending passions 
the powerful pull of plastic has cast creditcardcarrying 
consumers adrift in a sea of debt groups like new yorkbased 
budget amp credit counseling services inc have sprung up to help 
consumers get their heads back above water and keep them there 
the new york budgetcounseling office is one of more than 400 
offices nationwide affiliated with the nonprofit marylandbased 
national foundation for consumer credit 
the need for such services probably has intensified in recent 
years due to the legacy of the selfindulgent 1970s me decade in 
the 1980s a period of prolonged economic growth has put money into 
peoples pockets while the youcanhaveitall yuppie attitude has 
meant money did not burn many holes there 
in our societies wre terribly materialistic especially in 
america kress says we believe theres a godgiven right to 
acquire to be capitalistic its almost a holy thing 
hapworths compulsive spending treatment program is one of 
several that the medical and psychiatric facility provides it also 
runs specialized programs for people addicted to alcohol drugs and 
tobacco and people with eating disorders in addition to addicts 
it treats patients seeking help with sexual dysfunctions stress 
depression and other problems 
a 90minute behavior evaluation costs 150 and hapworth charges 
90 for a private behavior therapy session and 50 for group 
therapy the center says most insurance companies cover its 
compulsive spending addiction program 
besides helping patients stick to a budget and break the 
creditcard habit hapworth seeks to get to the root of their 
problems sometimes the sense of loss associated with giving up 
another habit such as smoking drinking or drug use leads 
troubled people to seek solace in shopping 
in simple terms a woman fixated on belts might be 
subconsciously seeking to restrain herself a man who cannot do 
without the latest hightech sports gadgetry might be trying to buy 
youth or a good body in compensation for some perceived failing 
typically compulsive spending addicts plan sprees with great 
longing and go into almost hypnotic trances or feel out of control 
while shopping kress says 
to control spending while being treated for the addiction 
hapworth has numerous dos and donts for patients such as 
never shop alone 
never use credit cards 
always use cash if possible 
stick to shopping lists 
dont keep purchases a secret 
return or give to charity any duplicate items you own 
the addiction affects rich and poor but wealthy people do not 
wind up in financial difficulty unless they really go overboard 
both women and men suffer from uncontrollable spending urges 
contrary to the tv sitcom stereotype of the dizzy female going 
gaga over sales 
were trying to point out that this is not something 
frivolous its a serious problem that no one takes seriously 
kress says 
but not everyone should automatically feel guilty about shopping 
im not antimaterialism its fine to like beautiful 
things kress says when you use it to avoid your feelings 
thats when it becomes a problem

school reform the subject of president bushs 
just competed summit with the governors is following a unique 
pattern in americas third largest school system as one chicago 
educator put it the nation has never had a plan like this 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
parents will wield unprecedented power to shape 
public education in chicago following elections this month that 
culminate sweeping reforms in the school system often labeled the 
nations worst 
on oct 1112 voters will elect members to 540 local councils 
which will oversee the citys 603 schools 
the councils each composed of six parents and five other 
members including teachers principals and local residents without 
schoolchildren will have authority to hire and fire principals 
develop school improvement plans and spend money 
its the worst system in the country parents cant do any 
worse than the current system said norman hodgson a father of 
two and candidate for a council that will serve his kindergarten 
daughters northwest side elementary school 
the councils are a key element of a new reform package aimed at 
decentralizing the board of educations powers and eliminating 
deepseated problems that have given chicagos public schools a 
reputation as the nations worst 
and nearly everyone who has a stake in the city from hispanic 
lawmakers and black community activists to white corporate 
executives is participating in a mobilization effort to get 
parents and others involved 
critics say the decentralization goes too far putting too much 
power in the hands of those unequipped to deal with it they say 
schools cant be expected to cure ills that stem from broken 
families 
but reformers argue that by getting parents involved the plan 
will help break a vicious cycle of problems that may begin in 
povertystricken homes but has spilled over into schools and 
created generations of apathetic educators too willing to accept 
the status quo 
one of the changes we hope will happen is teachers and 
principals will stop blaming the families and start thinking about 
what they can do to make a difference said donald moore 
executive director of designs for change an education research and 
advisory council that helped shape the reform package 
who knows more about educating their children than parents 
along with educators weve got to work together hodgson said 
that is the battle cry of the numerous corporations community 
and civic organizations all trying to make sure the reform plan 
passed last year by the state legislature gets off on the right 
foot 
grassroots organizing efforts by groups like designs for change 
have sent volunteers into the citys housing projects going 
doortodoor to recruit candidates for the twoyear council 
positions school officials sought 10000 candidates but passed 
the mark by thursday with nearly 14650 although some 
neighborhoods still lack full slates 
corporations have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars and 
clergymen have devoted sermons to urging their congregations to get 
involved and vote for the sake of the schools 410000 children 
everyones talking about it said lucy moore a 58yearold 
grandmother running in an poor black neighborhood on the south side 
so far everyone that i talk to in the neighborhood says they 
are interested she said they say they will vote they say our 
children are at stake they are our future 
each council will include six parents two teachers and two 
community residents without schoolchildren school staffs will 
elect the teacher members the 11th member of each council will be 
the principal of the school the council oversees in some cases 
councils will oversee more than one school 
council powers will include signing principals to fouryear 
performance contracts and deciding whether to renew what 
essentially were lifetime jobs before reform 
principals will have authority to hire teachers and dismiss them 
after 45 days probation regardless of seniority before teachers 
deemed unsatisfactory had a year to improve politics and seniority 
often made principals hire teachers they didnt want 
before the central board had to approve every little thing 
that the school did now their role is much more to be a monitor to 
enforce minimum standards said donald moore of designs for 
change 
the chicago teachers union which represents 28000 district 
employees including nearly 21800 teachers did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
reform also means shifting more money to schools that serve the 
most lowincome students and eliminating supefluous administrative 
jobs 500 already have been cut for example the school system 
trimmed some positions when it stopped testing teacher applicants 
to prove their state certification 
chicagos school budget this year is 226 billion up about 
200 million over last year while reform does not call for more 
state money it involves shifting budget money to give a larger 
share to educating low income students moore said 
and 40 million that resulted from eliminating board jobs is 
being pumped into the reform effort he added 
what this law does it to put a mechanism in place so that 
principals and teachers will be held accountable for their schools 
by the people who have the most at stake that is primarily by 
parents moore said 
chicagos woes gained nationwide scrutiny in 1987 when william 
bennett then president reagans education secretary labeled the 
citys schools the worst in the nation the reform effort has put 
the system in the national spotlight again 
chicagos school reform is the most fundamental reorganization 
of a big city school system since the early part of the 20th 
century said david cohen professor of education and social 
policy at michigan state university 
i think a lot of people thought the chicago system was about 
as poor as any system in the country said norm fruchter senior 
consultant for the academy of educational development a new 
yorkbased group that analyzes urban school systems 
fruchter cited such problems as a doubledigit dropout rate a 
lowincome student population approaching 70 percent 
no other system with local school councils puts the kind of 
control in parents hands that the chicago reforms do fruchter 
said 
most observers agree that despite the snags the reform plan is 
a unique effort to restore quality values and promise to the 
citys schools 
chicago has never had a plan like this the nation has never 
had a plan like this said sylvia peters principal of a south 
side elementary school 
if we begin to visualize success she said and go about 
actually putting success in place well succeed

sometime in the next decade nurses preparing 
patients for routine surgery may draw out a few pints of blood and 
replace it with something the laws of nature would seem to forbid 
cows blood 
cows blood actually just the oxygencarrying part of it is 
one of several substances under development by biotechnology firms 
seeking a safe clean and maybe even superior substitute for what 
flows through human veins 
doctors at massachusetts general hospital hope to begin 
experiments this fall on healthy human volunteers to see if bovine 
blood transfusions are safe extensive human testing will be 
necessary to overcome skepticism about mixing blood between the 
species 
everybody says you cant give cows blood to a human just 
like you cant give some peoples blood to other people said 
carl rausch head of biopure a bostonbased company working on 
this approach but we are talking about just the oxygen transport 
medium which is hemoglobin 
ordinarily blood organs and hormones cannot be swapped between 
cats and mice or people and elephants because they are rejected as 
foreign substances but there are exceptions for instance 
diabetics take cow insulin and pig valves are used as replacements 
in human hearts 
biopure has more than people in mind for its product tufts 
universitys veterinary school plans to test the same cow blood 
intended for humans to treat sick dogs besides opening up a big 
market among veterinarians it envisions a 60 million a year 
business in transfusions for dogs and cats alone biopure hopes 
that by showing bossies blood works fine for tabby and rover 
people will begin to accept the idea that its good for aunt 
gertrude as well 
people are nervous about this because its bovinederived 
said rausch if you can get a substitute to work in a wide range 
of species then the naysayers will have to say it might work 
 
it should work he and others believe because many creatures 
people included produce similar hemoglobin in three years of 
tests animals showed no adverse reaction to cow hemoglobin even 
when it replaced 95 percent of their own blood 
blood fulfills many vital jobs transporting nourishment 
hormones and diseasefighting armaments the substitutes envisioned 
by biopure and others would take the place of just one of these 
components the red cells 
red cells are packed with hemoglobin a molecule that picks up 
oxygen in the lungs and delivers it throughout the body putting 
back hemoglobin usually in the form of red cell transfusions is 
often essential for offsetting the blood loss of accident victims 
and surgical patients 
there have been attempts to make red cell substitutes for a 
quarter of a century said dr harvey g klein chief of 
transfusion medicine at the national institutes of health in 
bethesda md 
northfield labs in northfield ill and baxter travenol in 
fairfield nj among others are developing red cell substitutes 
from expired human blood green cross in japan has made a 
fluorocarbonbased synthetic molecule that can carry oxygen while 
somatagen in broomfield colo is attempting to make human 
hemoglobin through gene splicing 
the great enthusiasm recently is because of the perceived 
increased risk of infection being transmitted by transfusions 
primarily aids klein said red cell substitutes could be 
purified to such an extent that viral contamination wouldnt be an 
issue red cells cant be right now 
despite screening a tiny risk remains of getting aids from a 
transfusion other viruses can also be passed along including 
hepatitis and herpes as well as a variety of foreign proteins 
every time you take blood its like putting a quarter in the 
slot machine said dr charles huggins head of massachusetts 
generals blood bank if you are unlucky and come up with three 
lemons you can get hepatitis or something else 
rausch said bovine hemoglobin is purified to be 99999999999 
percent free of viruses even if a microbe slips through it will 
be a cow germ unlikely to cause a human disease 
among other advantages the substitutes could be given to anyone 
without matching the blood type and unlike real blood which must 
be thrown away after about three weeks the fake varieties would 
last six months and perhaps longer 
huggins who will be participating in the human testing of cow 
blood said i am making every effort to put myself out of 
business 
however dr leon hoyer vice president of research and 
development at the american red cross doubts this will happen 
blood is becoming safer as tests are developed for more viruses he 
said and doubts will linger about the safety of routinely using 
bovine blood and other substitutes 
its going to take a significant number of clinical trials to 
show that they have no toxicity at all its one thing to use them 
when you have no alternative its another to use them electively 
im not sure that they will have an advantage over standard blood 
that is subject to better testing and viral inactivation procedures 
that will get rid of those issues 
even if the substitutes dont replace real red cells experts 
say there are several situations where they might be routinely used 
before such operations as hip replacements which involve the 
loss of large quantities of blood patients might put several pints 
of their own blood in storage and replace it with a hemoglobin 
substitute after the operation their own blood would be put back 
ambulances might carry blood substitutes so transfusions could 
begin immediately for accident victims rather than after they 
arrive at the hospital where their blood type can be matched 
the military would like to develop a freezedried blood 
substitute that could be mixed with sterile water on the 
battlefield so combat victims could be stabilized until they are 
evacuated to hospitals 
they could be used to treat victims of heart attacks and 
strokes because the substitutes are thinner than blood they might 
ooze around clots and carry oxygen to starving tissue preventing 
permanent damage until clots dissolve 
they could be used to keep organs alive until they are 
transplanted 
by boosting oxygen levels they might improve the killing power 
of radiation therapy in treating cancer 
since hemoglobin is a rich source of iron it might increase 
the bodys natural production of new red cells especially when 
combined with a growthstimulating hormone 
one clear advantage of cow blood is the supply of raw material 
rausch estimates 70 million cows are slaughtered in the united 
states each year and each contains five to seven gallons of blood 
most of it goes to waste 
while plasma is salvaged for fish food the red cells are a 
goopy mass that must be dried and taken to a landfill rausch said 
he can buy it for 50 cents a gallon by 1994 when if all goes 
well his product is approved for routine human use rausch 
expects to be able to sell the highly purified substitute for 150 
to 200 a pint the price he believes real blood will cost then

a mysterious seemingly peaceful force 
drove people from villages like this throughout the region nearly 
8000 years ago foiling one of mankinds first drives toward 
civilization 
in chips of charcoal slivers of plaster and trash heaps of 
bones archaelogists say they have found a major suspect the 
domesticated goat 
goats are referred to as the black plague of the desert 
said gary rollefson of san diego state university archaeologists 
suggest that voracious newly domesticated animals destroyed the 
soil and ate the fuel around some of humanitys earliest 
settlements helping to push people into becoming nomads 
the villages here rose about the same time as those in ancient 
mesopotamia what is now iraq which later evolved into 
civilization 
mesopotamia never had this abandoned period rollefson said 
one of the reasons was they didnt have goats 
he has spent six digging seasons at ein ghazal on the edge of 
amman together with codirectors zaidan kafafi from the university 
of jordan and alan simmons of the university of nevadas desert 
research institute in reno 
their work completed this summer uncovered one of the middle 
easts more important archaeological sites a village roughly three 
to four times the size of ancient jericho that traded with other 
peoples hundreds of miles away 
it was one of the largest population centers of its time 
rollefson said estimating that at its peak as many as 3000 
people might have been crowded into its 35 acres 
jericho about 30 miles to the west and other early settlements 
in the region were abandoned about 6500 bc rollefson said but 
ein ghazal hung on for another 1500 years near the edge of the 
great arabian deserts 
ein ghazals survival despite a drier location argues against 
the more common theory that villagers abandoned the early 
settlements when the climate warmed making farming and food 
gathering too difficult he said 
but goats were first domesticated about 7000 bc and rapidly 
became a major source of food in the region 
villages like ein ghazal depended on a good source of water and 
on nearby trees for fuel to produce plaster or cook food and for 
pillars in their homes as well as to protect against soil erosion 
trees are a renewable resource but goats eat anything that grows 
and trees dont move very fast so you dont get any regrowth of 
the forest rollefson said 
the soil was completely eroded washed away when the 
village was abandoned about 5000 bc he added 
the excavations showed progressive evidence of environmental 
deterioration as the village matured chunks of charcoal became 
smaller roof beams thinner animal bones less varied thats an 
indication theyd been destroying the habitat for all these wild 
animals rollefson said 
ein ghazal was discovered in the early 1980s when road builders 
bulldozed through the site the most spectacular discovery came 
during the first digging season in 1983 when archaeologists 
unearthed 25 clay human figures dated to the 68th century bc 
which may have been used in a cult of ancestor worship 
when the first was found rollefson said the hair on the back 
of my neck literally stood up i was looking at a face looking back 
up at me undisturbed for about 9000 years

a quartermile oval track nestled among 
the towering oaks will let researchers study the stresses of racing 
and the peak performance of a breed of highly trained athletes 
racing greyhounds 
the 300000 yearold track is the only one of its kind at an 
academic institution built purely for research said dr mark 
bloomberg director of the university of floridas center for 
veterinary sports medicine 
the track financed by the florida division of the american 
greyhound track operators also lets veterinarians treat dogs that 
are injured or have problems racing he said the idea is to get 
them back winning some of these dogs are very valuable it will be 
an environment for diagnosis and prognosis 
projects by students and 20 faculty members include research 
into the incidence and characteristics of injuries hypothyroidism 
changes in fluid in the joints and exerciseinduced bleeding the 
injury study involves a survey of racing greyhound injuries that 
occur in training and on commercial tracks 
with the dogs hitting 40 mph in sprints leg injuries are 
common bloomberg said and the track will be used to evaluate 
dogs with orthopedic injuries we want to really get into is the 
biomechanics of the race track itself 
composition of the track surface banking and other factors will 
be examined he said we want to provide a safe running surface 
that decreases the rate of injuries and prolong racing careers 
he said 
most tracks use a mixture of sand and clay though others have 
been tried 
researchers also are examining greyhound reproduction racing 
females are are given male hormones to disturb their fertility 
cycle when their careers end it can take 18 months or more before 
they return to full fertility 
another study examines whether racing dogs have the same 
problems as race horses that bleed into their lungs and whether 
this affects performance 
the spread of infectious disease through a kennel is another 
concern of the industry bloomberg said 
greyhound pups begin training when they are 16 months to 2 years 
old and most run until they are about 5 some kennels with 
excellent breeding stock may race 90 percent of their dogs while 
others have only 25 percent to 50 percent of their dogs heading for 
the track 
greyhounds run instinctively he said and the training is 
designed to teach them to chase the lure the training also gets 
the dog into shape and good training even helps the average dog 
racing dogs are in many ways like human athletes he said and 
some will perform when injured while others wont the ones with 
the most heart may beat the best athletes 
bloomberg hopes the track will draw more researchers as more 
states legalize racing texas and kansas are each building three 
tracks and wisconsin is building five greyhound racing also is 
popular in england ireland france spain mexico australia and 
the scandinavian countries 
in addition to the track operators money comes from the 
greyhound industry private companies financing research and the 
universitys division of sponsored research since its founding in 
the 1940s the greyhound industry in florida has blossomed into the 
largest in the country 
in fiscal 1987 racing at floridas 18 tracks raised 80 
million in tax revenues for the state compared to about 29 
million for jaialai 12 million for thoroughbred horse racing and 
15 million for harness racing said george johnson executive 
director of the florida group

women and whites are at greater risk of 
thyroid disease than other groups according to a study that found 
nearly 9 percent of people over 55 suffer from some thyroid gland 
dysfunction 
in the wayne state university study of 488 whites and 480 
blacks 89 percent suffered some thyroid dysfunction said dr 
nanda bagchi a professor of medicine at the school two percent of 
the total suffered hyperthoidism or excessive thyroid function 
and 69 percent had hypothyroidism too little 
the thyroid located in front and to each side of the trachea 
secretes thyroxine to regulate growth and metabolism 
hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss nervousness rapid pulse and 
muscle weakness hypothyroidism can cause sluggishness puffiness 
constipation depression weight gain and hair loss 
about half the cases of hypothyroidism were caused by underlying 
autoimmune thyroid disease a condition that causes the body to 
react to the thyroid and diminishes its function bagchi said 
twothirds of the hyperthyroidism cases were attributable to too 
much thyroid hormone prescribed by doctors he said 
treatment of hyperthyroidism is particularly important among 
older people because it can aggravate heart disease he said 
thyroid disease strikeds about 15 percent of people aged 75 and 
over about twice as often as those 5564 
the study reported last month at a meeting of the american 
thyroid association also found that 127 percent of whites had 
dysfunction compared with 69 percent of blacks and 112 percent 
of women vs 62 percent of men

toddlers exposed to cocaine in the womb are 
shorter have smaller heads and are more likely to have learning 
handicaps than children who have not been exposed according to a 
study on drugs and pregancy 
we foresee that many of these children will end up in special 
education or classes for the learning disabled said dr ira 
chasnoff the director of the chicagobased study of 277 children 
including 228 exposed to drugs twothirds of the mothers used 
other drugs in addition to cocaine he said 
the problems include a lack of concentration and inability to 
accomplish tasks easily performed by other children concluded the 
study released to the national association for perinatal addiction 
research and education 
the association estimates that 375000 babies are born each year 
in the united states to mothers who used drugs during their 
pregnancy 
a boston university study earlier this year found similar 
results on stature and head size chasnoff said this has a lot of 
implications for longterm development since head circumference 
is an indication of brain growth 
these children on the whole are not mentally retarded 
overall these babies cognitively and functioning normally he 
said the tendency to become distracted and troubled by 
unstructured tasks holds back the exposed children 
on tests calling for blocks to be put in appropriateshaped 
holes drugexposed children were more likely to become confused 
and overwhelmed 
what i hear teachers telling me are the same things im 
telling you right here chasnoff said at an association 
conference last month the teachers are calling this to the 
attention of the school systems but the school systems are not 
ready to deal with it

argentina has reached agreement with the 
international monetary fund for a 14 billion loan to help the 
government cope with the countrys financial troubles president 
carlos menem and the imf said 
argentina owes nearly 45 billion in unpaid interest on 60 
billion worth of foreign debt it has been paying little for the 
last year and a half the country is the third worlds third 
largest debtor after brazil and mexico 
menem speaking wednesday at the national press club did not 
divulge details of the agreement reached during the annual meeting 
of the imf and its sister group the world bank 
he said argentina wants to honor its debt commitments but added 
that the countrys creditors should take into account argentinas 
needs including its struggle to achieve economic growth 
argentina he said is facing the most dangerous economic 
crisis in our history because of recession hyperinflation 
disinvestment and debt 
menems predecessor raul alfonsin was unable to make the 
promises that the fund requires in return for help cuts in 
government spending and other austerity measures that could have 
led to serious disturbances 
last february in venezuela an estimated 300 people were killed 
in rioting when a new government took measures in agreement with 
the fund that raised prices for gasoline bus fares and other vital 
products 
it takes several weeks or months before money from an imf loan 
is actually disbursed it was widely expected that soon after an 
agreement was reached between the fund and argentina a bridge loan 
from the united states and other countries would be granted to help 
tide argentina over 
argentine negotiators met wednesday with richard erb the funds 
deputy managing director and representatives of leading countries 
among the 152 in the fund the united states is the largest 
contributor 
last october argentina got 125 billion in loans from the 
world bank the bank suspended much of its disbursement when 
argentina failed to meet its conditions 
officials estimated that argentina only received about 300 
million of the money

pepsico incs foreign beverage operations are 
being realigned into six new units carved out along geographic 
lines in an attempt to expand pepsis international soft drink 
business the company said 
roger enrico president and chief executive of the companys 
pepsico worldwide beverages division on wednesday named presidents 
of each of the six units which he said would be selfsufficient 
with broad local authority in areas such as marketing sales and 
technical operations 
christopher a sinclair a veteran pepsico executive who most 
recently had headed the central division of pepsicola usa with 
responsibility for 11 midwest states was named president of 
pepsicola international 
previously the foreign operations were divided into 15 regions 
that reported to four middlemanagers based in somers ny under 
the new foreign alignment the regional presidents report directly 
to sinclair in somers 
enrico had headed pepsicola international as well as handling 
his worldwide posts since february when robert beeby left to head 
pepsicos fritolay inc snack food subsidiary 
beverage industry analysts said the realignment reflects the 
importance pepsi is placing on the international beverage 
marketplace where it long has trailed cocacola co by a wide 
margin 
many industry observers say soft drink makers view the 
international market as offering the most promising opportunity for 
growth 
industry analysts said pepsi derives slightly less than 50 
percent of its softdrink volume from international sales or about 
2 billion of its 42 billion cases sold worldwide annually but 
international sales account for only about 20 percent of the 
companys 5 billion in worldwide revenue 
jesse meyers publisher of the industry journal beverage digest 
said foreign markets are appealing to soft drink makers because 
average per capita consumption of soft drinks is only a fraction of 
what it is in the united states affording greater growth 
opportunities 
pepsicola international said the realignment will place some of 
its most seasoned international executives on the front lines of 
the international soft drink market 
the six foreign regions the presidents and base of operations 
are western europe frederick meils london latin america luis

sony corps agreement to pay 34 billion for 
columbia pictures entertainment inc will give columbias biggest 
shareholder cocacola co a chance to get 145 billion in gross 
revenue for its stock 
analysts said wednesday cocacola was likely to use it for soft 
drink operations and to buy back its own stock 
cocacola owns 538 million shares or 49 percent of columbias 
stock the softdrink maker signed an option agreement to sell its 
stake to sony for 27 a share subject to ratification by the 
cocacola board which is to meet monday 
cocacola spokesman randy donaldson declined to say what coke 
will do with the cash 
but some analysts suggested the money would be used to 
accelerate cokes stock buyback program or invest the cash in its 
overseas bottling operations 
i dont think theyre going to get into any other business in 
a material way said george e thompson a softdrink industry 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
john maxwell jr who follows cocacola for wheat first 
securities in richmond va said he expects coke will complete the 
final portion of an ongoing 40 million share buyback program and 
possibly start another one 
he said cocacola will probably also invest in its soft drink 
business overseas 
cocacola got into the movie business in 1982 when it bought a 
predecessor of columbia pictures cocacola subsequently launched a 
new studio called tristar pictures in a joint venture with cbs 
inc and home box office inc 
in late 1987 cocacola merged its entertainment business with 
tristar and wound up with 80 percent of the company that was 
called columbia pictures entertainmment it then distributed part 
of its interest in columbia to cocacola shareholders and retained 
49 percent in columbia 
but thompson said cocacola was disappointed by its return on 
motion pictures even though the television business was promising 
in the current movie season 28 movies from columbia and its 
sister company tristar have accounted for only 14 percent of all 
admissions sold 
before the ink was even dry on the 1982 columbia 
acquisition they realized they were in a business much more 
volatile than they were used to thompson said

betting lines on the effects of sony corps 
34 billion buyout of columbia pictures entertainment inc emerged 
quickly with the deal evaluated as 
bearish for present columbia management with chief executive 
victor kaufman probably to be replaced by producer peter guber 
batman rain man flashdance and studio chief dawn 
steels future uncertain 
bullish for struggling columbia with sony likely to bring 
stability to a studio beset by shifting management strategies and 
persistent rumors that controlling shareholder cocacola co was 
shopping for a buyer 
bearish for the us economy as profits from yet another 
allamerican business go abroad 
but bullish for producers of movies tv shows and recordings 
who sell to the entertainment giants that feed the worlds 
insatiable appetite for us entertainment 
many in hollywood were uneasy about sonys purchase the latest 
and largest in a string of foreign investments in show business 
the japanese are buying up a vital american institution 
something that no one else in the world can do as well as we can 
said an independent movie producer who insisted on anonymity 
because he hopes to do business with the columbia and tristar 
studios both owned by columbia pictures 
there just arent that many people that know the music 
business and the movie business and you have to count on them to 
run things 
theyre characters theyre flakes and theyre essential to 
the business im sure there must be a kind of culture shock to 
the japanese the producer said 
however alex ben block editor in chief of show biz news said 
foreign investment or at least ownership by internationally 
oriented businesses is inevitable only global megastudios 
with multiple businesses can take full advantage of the booming 
worldwide demand for us entertainment he said 
added dale pollock vice president in charge of production at 
aampm films were entering a new era of communications 
its global and its not just studios said pollock noting 
that his companys parent aampm records is being bought by 
dutchowned polygram for 500 million 
another key example of the internationalizing of hollywood 
media baron rupert murdoch whose australiabased news corp owns 
20th century fox film corp 
murdochs fox tv network here and fledgling fourchannel british 
satellite tv network needs programming he was outbid this month 
for mgmua which like columbia has a huge library of movies and 
tv shows by another australian outfit qintex group 
in researching a book on fox block talked to murdoch who 
made it clear that strong americanmade programming opens doors 
all over the world block said 
it leads to advertising joint ventures a multitude of ways 
to do business and it all comes back to the american creative 
force 
the big hollywood outfits need legions of small companies to 
feed them movies television shows and recordings a boon for 
hollywoods creative forces 
the deals bode well for moviegoers block said 
its going to stabilize these big companies theyre going to 
make more movies and there will be that much more to choose from 
block said 
but he added its distressing to see this industry one of 
the last of the big purely american industries be so bought up 
block said he expected sony to follow japanese business practice 
by asking trusted executives at cbs records which sony bought two 
years ago and perhaps at svs films a small movie company sony 
recently started to help manage columbia 
the columbia studio has swung from one end of the moviemaking 
spectrum to the other in recent years 
hightoned british producer david puttnam chariots of fire 
the killing fields ran it for 18 months but alienated such 
hollywood stalwarts as producer ray stark puttnam was replaced two 
years ago by dawn steel regarded as much more in the hollywood 
mainstream but the studios recent movies have had a mixed 
showing although its production of tv shows for the networks has 
been very strong 
regardless of the makeup of sonys management team for columbia 
most observers believed that once set it will remain in place for 
a long time 
sony bought prestigious cbs records in late 1987 for about 2 
billion and since has taken a handsoff approach letting walter 
yetnikoff run the nations secondlargest record company his way 
cbs artists who include michael jackson and bruce springsteen 
dont seem to have minded sonys ownership 
i havent really seen any major changes since the whole sony 
thing said record producer narada walden speaking in a 
telephone interview from kalamazoo mich walden has produced 
records for whitney houston barbra streisand and comedian eddie 
murphy theyre very trusting

unlike any company before sony corp will 
control every aspect of the motionpicture business with its 
purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc 
sony will own or produce the movie the movie theater the snack 
bar the soundtrack album the television series adaptation and 
the vcr and stereo system on which the videocassette and album can 
be played 
in addition to yielding this fully integrated entertainment 
power wednesdays sonycolumbia deal will give the japanese 
electronics giant a repository of films and television programs to 
show the world over 
while not in the same league as the 14 billion timewarner 
merger earlier this year the 34 billion sonycolumbia pact does 
share the same motivation survival in the booming international 
entertainment emporium 
were entering a new era of communications said dale 
pollock vice president in charge of production at aampm films 
its global and its not just studios said pollock noting 
that his companys parent firm aampm records is being bought by 
dutchowned polygram for 500 million 
sonys new multinational enterprise follows a yearlong effort to 
establish a hollywood foothold 
it will wed sonys dominance in stereo television set and tape 
player manufacturing with columbias proficiency in movie and tv 
production and motionpicture distribution and exhibition 
more important sony will have the supply to meet international 
demand entertainment is the united states secondleading export 
accounting for a net trade surplus of about 5 billion in the past 
four years overseas revenues from us films have risen to 113 
billion from 800 million 
fatal attraction for instance recovered all of its 
production costs in japanese theaters alone french channel tf1 
recently paid 11 million for 200 episodes of knots landing 
with the coming deregulation of most of european television and 
increasing sales of prerecorded videocassettes overseas the 
equation should continue to shift in favor of us products 
columbia has a library of 2770 feature films and 23000 
episodes of 260 television series 
movies in columbias collection include the last emperor 
gandhi kramer vs kramer and the natural sony also 
will take over loews theater management corp with more than 820 
screens in 220 locations and a national theater snack bar operation 
the marriage between sony and columbia resembles sonys 
acquisition of cbs records sony purchased cbs records home label 
to michael jackson and bruce springsteen for about 2 billion in 
late 1987 and let label head walter yetnikoff continue to run the 
company the way he wanted the label continues to be dominant 
early speculation though holds that columbia studio chief dawn 
steel will not remain at the helm 
for cocacola co columbias controlling stockholder for the 
last seven years the studio never proved to be the revenue center 
the softdrink giant hoped it would be in the current movie 
season 28 movies from columbia and its sister company tristar 
have accounted for only 14 percent of all admissions sold 
paramount pictures on the other hand claimed 146 percent of 
the boxoffice gate with just 10 titles 
tristars lock up sylvester stallones new prison movie 
was a dud grossing only 207 million in its first 52 days of 
release columbias the karate kid part iii made only 388 
million far less than its two predecessors 
casualties of war columbias vietnam film featuring michael 
j fox and sean penn probably wont cover its 25 million cost at 
the nations theaters the romantic comedy when harry met sally 
was perhaps columbias most profitable title this year 
grossing more than 78 million through tuesday 
but as weakly as columbia performed under steels leadership 
its fortunes have improved sharply from david puttnams reign of 
error 
puttnam the producer of such acclaimed films as chariots of 
fire and the killing fields was appointed president of 
columbia pictures in the fall of 1986 his film slate was marked by 
ambitious yet ultimately unpopular fare such as the adventures of 
baron munchausen housekeeping and punchline 
in acquiring columbia sony is following a path taken by other 
overseas companies in recent months 
mgmua maker of last years oscarwinning rain man is 
being sold to a subsidiary of australian entertainment company 
qintex group for 15 billion australianbased news corp already 
owns 20th century fox

the commodity exchange says it will test 
handheld tamperproof computer terminals for traders by early 
next year getting a jump on the chicago futures exchanges 
floor traders in the pits will enter orders on the terminals 
instead of on paper cards making it all but impossible to change a 
recorded transaction to conceal fraud comex said wednesday 
federal investigations of allegations of fraud have resulted in 
indictments on the chicago exchanges a separate probe is on 
commodity exchange trading floors in both chicago and new york the 
fraud supposedly involved brokers changing the size or time of a 
trade on their cards to disguise wrongdoing

chicago mercantile exchange are still in the talking stage on 
their handheld terminals cbot spokesman mark prout said 
well be very interested to see what the comex comes up with 
and how it works prout said 
the commodity exchange said it began planning the computer 
system four years ago well before the recent fraud allegations 
spokesman robert mcgrath said he could not say when the system 
would go into operation because it would depend on how the testing 
goes 
hopefully the results of this project will be an important 
step toward helping comex to fully meet the proposed new 
regulatory mandates of the cftc commodity futures trading 
commission and the us congress commodity exchange chairman

aluminum futures contracts is one of five futures exchanges that 
share space in the world trade center in new york

the system but added there is some excitement about cooperating 
and looking into the technology 
the other exchanges are the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange 
the new york cotton exchange the new york futures exchange and the 
new york mercantile exchange 
the computer terminals costing 2000 to 3000 each will 
weigh less than a pound and will be supplied by ags information

collected periodically by runners eventually the terminals

the us dollar remained lower against the japanese 
yen thursday morning while share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange bounced back from the previous days losses 
the 225issue nikkei stock average regained 19272 points or 
054 percent ending morning trading at 3556329 the highest 
morning closing ever it had lost 7425 points wednesday 
the dollar ended the morning session at 14083 yen it opened at 
14070 yen down 065 yen from wednesdays 14135yen close and 
moved in the range of 14065 to 14100 yen 
the dollars lower opening followed its overnight decline on 
overseas markets triggered by central bank intervention for the 
third consecutive day to push the us currency down traders said 
toru kanai foreign currency analyst with new japan securities 
co ltd said the dollaryen rate was moving closely around 14070 
yen in tokyo as market players were discouraged by the bank of 
japans dollarselling intervention 
following the group of seven industrial nations agreement on 
coordinated intervention last weekend in washington to halt the 
dollars rise the japanese central bank has intermittently 
conducted dollarselling operations since monday he said 
the bank of japan sold the dollar thursday immediately after the 
dollar exceeded 14080 yen and again sold more dollars when it 
almost touched 14100 yen kanai said 
the amount of selling was unknown the central bank does not 
comment on its monetary actions 
the only thing that keeps the dollar lower now is the closely 
coordinated central bank intervention after the g7 meeting he 
said 
when the central banks loosen their intervention the dollar 
might rise back but not as high as the level before the g7 
agreement he said 
on the stock exchange dealers said the index rebounded as 
market players were reassured by the stability in the dollaryen 
rate 
investment trust companies which had been reluctant to make 
major moves while the dollars fluctuations were uncertain started 
buying encouraging other market players to increase their own 
purchasing they said

former corporate raider paul a bilzerian 
received the stiffest sentence yet in the governments threeyear 
corruption probe but a federal judge said it wont necessarily 
deter other financial crimes 
i have been around the criminal justice system for 40 years 
us district judge robert j ward said wednesday before sentencing 
bilzerian to four years in jail and a 15 million fine 
when i began my experience there were wheelerdealers he 
said as i sit here today i am fairly certain there is 
wheelerdealering going on within five miles of this building 
bilzerian a highschool dropout and vietnam veteran who capped 
a meteoric business career with the 106 billion takeover of 
singer co was convicted june 9 on nine counts of securities 
fraud conspiracy to commit tax fraud and making false statements 
to the government 
he also was sentenced to two years probation and 250 hours of 
community service for a pattern of lawbreaking in three failed 
takeovers and another stock deal in 1985 and 1986 that netted him 
more than 12 million 
bilzerian had faced a maximum 45 years in prison and 225 
million in fines still his sentence was the longest to date in 
cases derived from the confessions of jailed stock speculator ivan 
boesky who is serving a threeyear term 
the lure of money has caused him an intelligent young man 
to lose what i perceive to be proper perspective ward said in 
short he lies 
the charges involved raids on apparel maker cluett peabody amp 
co building supplies maker hh robertson amp co and hammermill 
paper co and another transaction of armco inc stock 
bilzerian plans to appeal said his attorney arthur f mathews 
my trial and conviction has publicly humiliated me and i am 
sorry for any sorrow and shame i have caused my family and 
friends bilzerian stated in a presentencing letter to ward i 
wish i could turn back the clock of time and correct whatever 
mistakes i may have made 
bilzerian was freed on bail pending appeal but ward ordered 
bilzerian who in july reported a net worth of 814 million to 
pay the fines within 30 days 
none of the charges against bilzerian involved his 1988 takeover 
of singer the sewingmachine maker turned defense contractor 
the bilzerian conviction was the first jury verdict in the 
governments continuing whitecollar corruption probe which began 
with the may 1986 arrest of former trader dennis levine who led 
investigators to boesky 
bilzerian was convicted of submitting false documents to the 
securities and exchange commission filing false tax returns and 
rigging transactions to skirt federal tax and disclosure laws in 
tandem with los angeles stockbroker boyd l jefferies who 
testified against bilzerian 
jefferies who testified against bilzerian recently received a 
suspended sentence sentencing is pending for others including six 
former princetonnewport partners lp defendants found guilty of 
fraud and racketeering and former drexel burnham lambert inc 
managing director martin a siegel 
bilzerian who resigned as singer chairman in june still faces 
civil securities charges filed by the sec seeking 313 million in 
alleged illegal profits 
assistant us attorney david brodsky cited bilzerians alleged 
arrogance and utter disregard for the law said bilzerian 
committed perjury during the trial and said a lengthy prison term 
would deter similar behavior on wall street 
the case was the first criminal trial of illegal stock 
parking in which securities ownership is disguised to dodge 
federal tax or disclosure laws 
over an 18month period bilzerian committed serious securities 
crimes over and over again brodsky said 
mathews sought a suspended sentence on the grounds that 
bilzerian was a firsttime offender that his prosecution was a 
novelty that his crimes had no identifiable victims and that 
deterrence had been achieved

the grand hyatt hotel in washington dc 
its an attempt to stay in touch with the customers and the 
line employees said hartleyleonard who intends to make the job 
switch a yearly event 
wednesday was chosen because it was the 32nd anniversary of the 
companys founding he said 
i started working for hyatt 26 years ago as a desk clerk in 
one of the california hotels and i worked on the line until 11 
years ago when i had a chance to take a management job said 
hartleyleonard 45 i only realized recently that of the 426 
executives and employees in our corporate headquarters 340 had 
never actually worked in a hotel 
by doing service jobs for a day maybe theyll understand a 
bit more what service means he said 
the experiment meant sending computer experts out as 
chambermaids and business analysts as busboys 
at the hyatt regency chicago general manager rod young was busy 
just keeping track of where each of his new employees was 
one of them jim evans senior vice president for sales was 
assisting roosevelt moncure a convention services floor manager 
who was teaching him how to turn a banquet room 
this is one of more than 60 banquet rooms in this hotel and 
theyre all booked full this week moncure said we just had it 
set theaterstyle for 150 people and now were cleaning it out 
and setting it conference style for 20 people weve got to have 
it ready by 630 pm and if the guests tell us theyre bringing 
in 10 more people weve got to be ready for them 
im learning how to set up tables said evans i havent 
done this sort of work for 19 years and then it was for another 
chain normally id be selling this space to convention groups and 
just conferring with moncure and his people once a week to discuss 
the schedule 
despite any slowdowns the managersintraining may have caused 
in the line jobs the hyatt intouch day appeared to be good 
for customer relations outside the hotel hartleyleonard grinned 
as he told of one earlymorning encounter with a guest 
she looked at my name tag and said no youre not but i 
told her oh yes i am he said another lady who knew what 
was going on told her friend see what a good company does my

said he intends to resign when sony completes its 34 billion 
buyout of the company 
guber who was in new york where columbia is headquartered was 
unavailable for comment andrea jaffe a spokeswoman representing 
the guberpeters entertainment co declined comment on the rumor 
in a development early today guberpeters announced that it had 
accepted a proposal from sony usa inc to acquire the movie company 
for 1750 a share or about 200 million 
the deal is expected to be completed before the end of 1989 the 
company said in a statement under terms of the agreement sony 
will begin a tender offer next week for all guberpeters shares 
which will be followed by a cash merger 
guber and his partner former hairdresser jon peters produced 
the summer blockbuster batman and were executive producers of 
the academy awardwinning rain man 
guber has received high marks within the industry he was very 
smart about how to handle the movie said mark johnson the 
producer of rain man 
independent producer john davis noted that the expertise to 
run a studio is so specialized that they sony pretty much have to 
pick an insider and let go of the reins 
guber 47 attended new york university law school and spent 
seven years working for columbia including a twoyear stint as 
vice president of worldwide production 
he left the company in 1976 joining record producer neal bogart 
to form casablanca records and filmworks in 1980 guber teamed up

won four oscars in all 
guber and peters also produced gorillas in the mist 
flashdance the color purple missing midnight 
express the witches of eastwick innerspace and 
caddyshack ii 
the producers rumored move to columbia could be complicated 
severely by the teams recent renewal of a fiveyear deal with 
warner bros 
the pair had a number of films in development with warner bros 
including a batman sequel due in 1991 the film adaptation of 
the books bonfire of the vanities and a bright shining lie

us ambassador michael armacost called today for 
further reform of japans import and distribution systems and 
chided the press for using phrases denoting confrontation to 
describe usjapan trade relations 
you need to take bolder steps to ensure that where there are 
barriers to imported products they be removed armacost said in 
a speech to the japan national press club 
impatience with those barriers grows with your economic 
success he said the answer is not regulated trade but for 
you to deregulate areas of the economy in which if youll allow me 
as a foreigner to say your citizens enjoy the fruits of your labor 
in your own market 
he singled out japans complex distribution system as a barrier 
to international trade that should be addressed 
armacost 52 took up his duties as us envoy in tokyo in may 
he was previously undersecretary of state for political affairs and 
before that ambassador to the philippines 
he said that press reports to some extent american but 
primarily japanese perpetuate trade problems with provocative 
language 
one rarely sees usjapan trade described without the 
emphasis being placed almost exclusively upon masatsu 
friction he said were always hearing about the cherry 
war the beef and oranges war the landing of foreign 
capital 
one gets the impression from the press that japan is an armed 
fort trade is not like war not a zerosum game trade benefits 
both sides he said 
he also said japanese media promulgate the myth of japanese 
uniqueness that japan is so different from other countries it 
should be treated differently 
japanese uniqueness is overstated and used selectively he 
said acknowledgment of differences is fair but not a defense 
against making any adjustments to the new realities 
he urged the japanese press not to portray the us economy as 
in decline 
dont worry about us dont patronize us he said calling 
the american economy robust he said us workers are 
increasing product quality productivity and export consciousness 
a spate of recent talks between tokyo and washington from 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu and president bush down to 
workinglevel officials show that japan and the united states 
are necessary partners and natural competitors armacost said

ventres characterized bordens plans as a continuation of the 
fiveyear growth strategy the company has been pursuing since 1986 
in the first phase borden boosted its sales by about 60 percent 
and doubled its snacks business and tripled its pasta business 
through 77 acquisitions around the world mostly in food and 
consumer products the acquisitions added 31 billion to annual 
sales 
the plan outlined today was twofold 
first borden plans cost reductions aimed at increasing profit 
margins in the areas of business in which the company has been 
growing rapidly since the mid1980s 
borden which has six main lines of business says it is the 
worlds leading producer in pasta dairy wallcoverings and forest 
products adhesives it claims to be no2 in salty snacks 
some of bordens bestknown brands include wise snacks such as 
cheez doodles eagle brand dairy products and classico tomato 
sauce it also makes elmers glue and various paints and varnishes 
the second part of bordens plan involves the restructuring of 
the dairy operations the business will shrink by about onethird 
or by 700 million to 750 million so borden can shift its 
concentration to its strongest markets 
the exit from as yet unspecified dairy markets primarily will 
involve fluid milk and cultured products 
the 404 million aftertax reserve which will be taken against 
thirdquarter earnings is expected to improve pretax earnings by 
more than 340 million through 1993 borden said 
the company projected global sales will increase to about 76 
billion in 1989 up from 1988 sales of 72 billion

merck amp co the nations leading drug 
company and ei du pont de nemours and co are joining forces to 
develop a new class of heart disease medicine under a research and 
marketing pact the companies said today 
as part of the collaboration merck will turn over to 
wilmington delbased du pont the rights to sell two of its drugs 
in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds 
in an unusual arrangement merck said it was allowing du pont to 
market sinemet a major treatment for parkinsons disease and 
vaseretic a hypertension drug so it could focus on marketing 
other products 
sinemet accounted for 100 million of mercks 594 billion in 
sales last year spokesman john doorley said vaseretics revenues 
were less but he didnt know the precise figure 
the other half of the collaboration gives du pont a chemical 
energy and specialty products giant access to mercks highly 
proficient research staff and expertise at bringing products to 
market in developing a new class of heart disease medicine 
the class angiotensin ii receptor antagonists was developed by 
du pont a leader in the area angiotensin ii or aii is a major 
hormone and factor in high blood pressure 
the companies said the treatment is particularly safe because it 
acts on a very specific part of a persons body chemistry 
mercks researchers will work on the aii compounds which are 
now in human trials the companies hope to bring it to market in 
the mid1990s doorley said 
medical products accounted for 13 billion of du ponts 329

corn and soybean futures were slightly higher 
reflecting signs of stronger foreign demand while wheat futures 
slipped a bit early in todays session on the chicago board of 
trade 
support for the markets stemmed from talk of possible new export 
business with pakistan mexico and the soviet union after several 
weeks of slow export activity 
especially supportive were rumors that the soviet union was 
looking to buy up to 3 million metric tons of us corn or sorghum 
and signs that the soviets recently purchased grain from canada and 
soybean meal from south america 
the soviets had indicated earlier this month they would import 
no more grain this year 
what this is telling the market is that all the rhetoric about 
them not buying is just purely rhetoric that they are in to buy 
and its just a matter of terms said william biedermann 
director of research with allendale inc a futures brokerage in 
crystal lake ill 
early losses in the wheat market may have reflected 
positionevening by traders ahead of this afternoons quarterly

until this week whos the boss simply 
identified one of the more popular television shows from columbia 
pictures entertainment inc 
but in the wake of columbias agreement to a 34 billion cash 
buyout by sony corp it is a valid question for one of hollywoods 
biggest film and television production companies 
columbia said wednesday that its president and chief executive 
victor a kaufman and its chief operating officer lew korman 
intend to resign on completion of the buyout which the company 
expects will be in november 
sony executives privately confirmed they were courting movie 
producer peter guber for a major role at the company 
early today gubers production company guberpeters 
entertainment co announced it agreed to be acquired by sony usa 
for 1750 a share or about 200 million 
published reports said guber was being recruited to replace 
kaufman guber who coproduced batman rain man and 
flashdance is considered one of hollywoods top producers 
but spokesmen for sony and columbia each declined comment on 
whether sonys agreement to buy the company meant guber would take 
kaufmans place 
sony issued a statement saying we will not comment on the 
terms of the merger agreement which will be made a matter of public 
record in due course 
once the management issues are resolved sony said it intends 
to place daytoday operation of columbia pictures in the hands of 
us management just as it has done with its previous big us 
entertainment acquisition cbs records 
the deal for columbia comes nearly two years after the huge 
japanese video and audio equipment maker bought cbs records for 2 
billion 
it marks the biggest step of sonys push into the software 
side of the entertainment business that will provide products such 
as movies and records to complement its stereos televisions and 
videocassette recorders 
christopher dixon entertainment industry analyst for the 
investment firm kidder peabody amp co called it an opportunistic 
purchase for sony that will likely look even better a few years 
from now 
he said sony learned from its experience with cbs records that 
owning a company that produces software can help insure the 
popularity of new technological gadgets such as compact disk 
players 
owning a film and television production company could come in 
handy as sony introduces new types of playback devices dixon said 
it also could give sony its own sounding board in the professional 
community that could help in its development of equipment needed to 
produce shows for highdefinition tv sets 
dixon said the companys experience with cbs records also may 
have taught sony about the potential of the video market outside 
the united states 
and finally he said sony recognizes that the number of 
companies with film and tv libraries the size columbias are 
shrinking 
companies with hollywood studios including warner 
communications inc mgmua entertainment co and 20th century fox 
have been acquired recently 
columbia owns more than 2700 movies including classics such as 
lawrence of arabia and the bridge on the river kwai as 
well as the more recent ghostbusters and the karate kid 
its 23000 tv episodes include the primetime shows designing 
women and married with children the syndicated barney 
miller and the classic father knows best 
sony plans to launch a tender offer of 27 a share for all of 
columbias stock tuesday but already has option agreements for 
more than half of columbias shares at that price including the 49 
percent held by cocacola co and about 3 percent held by the 
investment firm allen amp co inc 
cocacola stands to collect 145 billion in gross proceeds from 
selling its nearly 54 million columbia shares to sony subject to 
approval by cocacolas board the board meets monday 
the atlantabased company declined to comment on what it intends 
to do with the cash but analysts speculated that it would invest 
in its softdrink operations overseas and possibly repurchase some 
of its stock 
in trading wednesday on the new york stock exchange columbia 
rose 25 cents a share to closet at 2650 while cocacola rose 50 
cents a share to 6462 
stephen a schwarzman president and chief executive of the 
blackstone group which advised sony said sony had been looking at 
various hollywood companies for more than a year 
michael schulhof vice chairman of sony corp of america said 
talks with columbia became serious only in the past week he said 
sony decided to make a proposal over last weekend and presented it 
to columbias board monday 
columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major 
hollywood force placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic 
boxoffice revenues through sept 4 according to the trade journal 
variety 
its owns two film studios columbia pictures and tristar 
pictures the television production companies columbia pictures 
television and merv griffin enterprises and operates 820 motion 
picture screens in 220 locations

the european community must drop possible 
restrictions against nonmember financial institutions as it plans 
for economic and monetary union by 1992 or risk provoking 
retaliation from the united states a us official said today 
we still see dangers in the ec concept of reciprocity 
despite european assurances and improvements in the proposed 
reciprocity provisions treasury undersecretary david c mulford 
said in testimony prepared for a house banking financial 
institutions subcommittee 
the 12nation european economic community hopes by 1992 to 
remove internal trade barriers and interlock economic policies and 
goals the united states and other noneuropean nations are 
concerned that the program could create a protectionist fortress 
europe against nonmember goods and services 
ec proposals for reciprocity in financial services continue to 
concern us mulford said because access to the ec market 
will still be conditional on the treatment of ec firms in 
thirdcountry markets 
despite the softening of reciprocity the implied threat 
remains a potentially powerful instrument which makes us uneasy 
he said 
moreover once this club in the closet is on the books 
there will be a temptation to use it especially given the ecs 
desire to promote changes in the us financial system mulford 
testified 
if actually used or rather misused this would run the 
risk of provoking a retaliation action from us authorities if 
us firms are discriminated against in the ec there would likely 
be consequences for ec national institutions 
mulford expressed confidence that useuropean differences can 
be worked out 
but he said officials come and go and there are always 
risks of misunderstandings i ask the europeans wouldnt it be 
better to lay these reciprocity weapons aside

curt carlson was a salesman in 1938 in 1988 he 
sat atop an almost fully owned personally assembled empire with 
sales of more than 53 billion a year one of the biggest 
companies in america 
today in minnetonka minn he steps away from daytoday 
operations of carlson companies inc employer of 55000 people 
worldwide and operator of more than 200 hotels and 400 restaurants 
in just one of its smaller divisions 
it was built from within by shrewd and intensive management 
and from without by equally shrewd purchases and considerable 
franchising and by setting what appeared to be impossible goals 
that were always achieved 
in the early years carlson sometimes doubled his companys size 
in a year between 1938 and 1978 the first billiondollar year 
growth averaged about 33 percent a year since then the goal has 
been to double every five years 
in the first year of the latest fiveyear plan the goal growth 
of about 15 percent a year was exceeded this year the company is 
right on target no reason says carlson not to expect sales of 
92 billion in 1992 
he admits to pinching himself we he and wife arleen 
appreciate how lucky we are time and again some little thing 
happened that was lucky for us sometimes i think it was divine 
intervention i wonder 
but he also thinks that entrepreneurial opportunities are even 
greater today because banks are easier to deal with there are tax 
advantages and franchising greatly reduces the risk of starting a 
business 
carlsons saga began in the great depression when he founded 
gold bond trading stamps sold the idea to a grocery store put up 
his pennants and promotional paraphernalia and invited arleen his 
fiance to view the scene 
we went down there the night before in the darkness with a 
flashlight he said and i told her that if it worked i could 
sell them all meaning every grocery store gold bond became one 
of americas largest stamp companies 
as stamps saturated the retail market carlson spotted other 
growth areas structured the company into marketing hospitality 
and travel groups and using internally generated profits and 
borrowings penetrated those areas 
the marketing operation is now the largest provider of corporate 
incentive training programs the hospitality group runs 223 
radisson hotels and resorts 260 country kitchens and 152 tgi 
fridays outlets the travel group is north americas largest 
travel agent with 1000 offices under names such ask mr foster 
p lawson travel and neiman marcus travel 
the three are mutually supportive synergistic groups 
after today all this becomes the domain of chief executive 
officer edwin skip gage a 20year veteran of the marketing 
group which now provides twothirds of volume and profit he is 
carlsons soninlaw 
i know that some people because he is my soninlaw have 
said things carlson said this week but gage he says has 
earned the job been tested under fire and performed well 
carlson 75 isnt likely to err at this point 
confident in his choice he dismisses notions that his decision 
isnt good business i think of president kennedys remark when 
he named brother robert attorney general that nepotism isnt bad 
if you keep it in the family 
is it possible to turn over the reins of so personal a package 
the answer of course lies in the action taken and while that 
action does indeed remove carlson from management it still leaves 
him as the money man money is power 
carlson will remain chairman of a newly created holding company 
carlson holdings inc but ive made it crystal clear that my 
job is governance not management 
governance as he describes it does indeed take him out of many 
decisions but it elevates rather than removes the holding company 
is above all the various carlson elements he will distance himself 
but remain aware 
he is determined to avoid interfering because i know that if 
im bold enough to stick my nose into something then i have to stay 
with it at this stage of life he says that isnt what he seeks 
i want to be free to do what i want to vacation and read 
something other than the business magazines and the wall street 
journal 
ive had a boat since 1962 and only two times have i been on 
it for two weeks and ive never taken the boat with arleen alone 
theres always been business people aboard 
he sounded determined but could he keep his distance if the 
company shows signs of deserting its culture and experimenting 
im not going to interfere if we break from tradition a bit 
he said but we cannot deviate and fail to hit the figures ill 
go along for two or three years and then well compromise 
he said he was removing himself ive got good intentions 
and lots of other things to do he said

more than 4 billion in fha mortgage insurance 
losses last year half to fraud and mismanagement have trippled 
the cost of the still unfolding scandals at the department of 
housing and urban development officials said today 
the chairman of a special house panel examining all of the 
governments insurance programs and huds inspector general agreed 
that the cost to taxpayers of wrongdoing and mismanagement at hud 
has swelled to 69 billion from the 22 billion previously 
believed 
in a longawaited audit the general accounting office estimated 
wednesday that the federal housing administration lost 42 billion 
in fiscal 1988 in defaults on home mortgages that it insured 
but comptroller general charles bowsher head of the 
congressional watchdog agency said that estimate could be as much 
as 1 billion too low because of the poor books kept by fha and hud 
and budgetary accounting practices in use throughout the government 
including expected losses this year and interest on covering the 
past losses rep charles schumer dny chairman of a house 
budget committee tax force examining urgent fiscal issues for the 
government said the price of fraud and mismanagement at hud has 
jumped to 69 billion 
that sounds like a reasonable estimate to me said paul 
adams huds inspector general whose report last spring on 
mismanagment in the departments housing rehabilitation program 
touched off a series of investigations by congress and the justice 
department into other hud programs 
it seems like theres a new volcano erupting every month over 
at hud said rep marcy kaptor dohio i fully put the blame 
at the feet of ronald reagan and the people who were supposed to be 
running the government the past decade 
government auditors said the fha fund that has helped millions 
of americans buy homes is in the red for the first time in history 
and will need up to 5 billion from congress over the next few 
years 
some of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically 
strapped areas of the country being unable to make their house 
payments bowsher said 
but he said at least half of it is due to mismanagment at hud 
and fraud by private mortgage insurers who were allowed to write 
fha mortgages under changes made by the reagan administration in 
1983 to privatize part of the program 
you have to monitor whats happening in the private sector 
when you delegate to the private sector bowsher said today 
likening the fha abuses to those that occurred in the savings and 
loan industry under the 1980s climate of deregulation 
bowsher on wednesday told the senate banking housing and urban 
affairs housing subcommittee there were a record 203000 fhabacked 
mortgage foreclosures last year concentrated in what he called 
the oil patch states of alaska texas oklahoma and louisiana 
and a few other areas suffering severe economic downturns 
that rash of personal financial failures combined with the 
bankruptcy of three big private companies that help insure the 
federal housing administrations multifamily and hospital 
construction programs account for most of a 42 billion oneyear 
loss in the consolidated fha insurance fund the report said 
subtracted from a surplus entering the year the loss resulted 
in the 29 billion deficit at the end of the year 
moreover the gao chief said a record number of new fha loans 
issued in 198586 will mean more red ink ahead no matter what new 
housing secretary jack kemp does as those new mortgages work 
through the traditionally rocky third and fourth years when 
strapped homeowners tend to sink or swim 
bowsher predicted congress will need to appropriate as much as 
5 billion over the next several years to keep the insurance fund 
solvent 
an estimated 9 million american families have purchased homes 
with fhabacked loans since the program was set up in 1934 and 
about 900000 do so each year 
the home loan program was selfsupporting until 1988 with 
insurance fees paid by all borrowers more than offsetting losses 
resulting from defaulted loans 
the gao said the 1988 losses are directly attributable to 
rising defaults in economically stressed regions losses from sales 
of foreclosed properties and the failure of several large private 
coinsurers 
the extent of losses attributable to program fraud and abuse 
is not yet known the report continued there are however a 
number of serious problems in the financial management of fha which 
contribute to its losses 
the report noted that the accounting and financial management 
problems have been longstanding and well documented in prior 
reports to congress going back to the early 1980s bowsher said 
congress must bear some of the blame for inadequate oversight 
at the same time he agreed with committee members and hud 
officials who emphasized that the fha financial problems are 
nowhere near the scope of those involved in the savings and loan 
insurance fund 
he noted that he has met with kemp and other new hud officials 
and received their full cooperation in assessing the fha problems 
and placing last years losses at 42 billion rather than the 858 
million reported earlier by the reagan administration bowsher said 
he found the kemp team anxious to do the right thing 
hud assistant secretary c austin fitts brought in by kemp to 
oversee the fha appeared with bowsher at the subcommittee hearing 
we acknowledge that fha has incurred substantial losses she 
said the bad news is out on the table we believe the problems 
are manageable and fixable 
she said most of the past problems could have been avoided by 
being more careful who you let in to various fha programs

the house today voted to support president 
bushs capital gains tax cut rejecting democratic cries that it 
was a giveaway to the rich 
culminating weeks of political struggle the house defeated by a 
vote of 239 to 190 a democratic attempt to replace bushs tax cut 
with a plan to raise tax rates for the wealthy and restore 
deductions for individual retirement accounts 
the vote left intact a proposal supported by the president which 
would cut by 40 percent the maximum tax rate for earnings from 
stocks bonds real estate timber and other assets a final vote 
on the overall bill which contains many other unrelated budget 
provisions and issues isnt expected until next week 
the capital gains reduction was supported by 175 republicans and 
64 democrats and opposed by 189 democrats and one republican doug 
bereuter of nebraska 
republicans and conservative democrats who sided with the 
president said the tax cut would be a tonic for the economy and 
they called the democratic alternative a sign of a taxandspend 
philosophy 
i am very pleased by the bipartisan house vote which 
represents a step forward for economic growth new jobs and 
american competitiveness bush said in a statement after the vote 
a lower capital gains rate will reduce the cost of capital and 
create incentives for investment in the longterm productive 
capacity of american industry the president said 
rep newt gingrich rga the minority whip said the vote 
showed the waning influence of the liberals in the democratic 
party and predicted bush would continue winning with the help of 
democratic conservatives 
but house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he was proud 
we took this position and said the democratic schism on capital 
gains was not something that extended to other issues 
the democratic leadership believes in redistributing the 
wealth the bipartisan coalition believes in creating wealth 
said house minority leader robert h michel rill he decried the 
rancid rhetoric of class warfare being used against a proposal 
which he said would mean more growth more jobs and help us all 
be more competitive in an increasingly competitive world 
house majority leader richard gephardt argued that supporting 
the bush plan meant youll be voting to give 25000 a year on 
the average to the wealthiest families in america at a time 
when the federal deficit was eroding the us position in 
international markets 
the vote wasnt as close as both sides were predicting up until 
the end although republicans were confident they took steps to 
make sure rep james courter rnj was called by the white 
house 810 times late wednesday to make sure he took a break from 
his gubernatorial campaign to vote 
in advance of the vote each side was accusing the other of 
unseemly armtwisting 
we know theres just been unmerciful kind of pressure brought 
to bear on the democratic side against their members who were 
inclined to side with bush michel said 
i suspect it michels comment is a suggestion made to 
cover republican tactics of that sort countered foley 
obviously the president is using every means at his disposal 
including inducements to members of various unstated kinds 
with the presidents blessing the house ways and means 
committee put into the huge 2000page budget bill a provision 
cutting the maximum capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 196 
percent for the next 27 months after that the rate would go to 28 
percent but profits attributed to inflation would not be taxed 
foley and the house democratic leadership took a stand against 
the tax break citing statistics which show the overwhelming 
majority of the benefits would go to people earning over 100000 a 
year 
their proposal included a tax increase for the wealthy 
increasing their marginal tax rates from 28 percent to 33 percent 
so it would be the same as for uppermiddleclass taxpayers the 
revenue would be used to cut the deficit and restore universal tax 
deductions for individual retirement accounts 
the democrats also included a small cut in the top capital gains 
rate from 33 percent to 28 percent 
although the tax increase would apply only to the 600000 
wealthiest taxpayers in the nation mostly people earning more 
than 150000 a year bush threatened a veto and republicans 
gleefully attacked the democratic plan 
tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax tax 
tax tax tax tax said rep paul henry rmich repeated 
for a minute in a speech before the house on wednesday 
foley said a democratic loss in the house would not put bush on 
a sure track toward victory 
the senate leadership feels as strongly as our leadership 
does that this capital gains proposal is a detriment to the budget 
process unfair and an inequitable proposal bad tax policy 
foley said 
if we had more time theres no question in my mind wed be 
winning big said rep vic fazio dcalif who helped foley 
lobby for the package 
the capital gains provision is just one of many controversies on 
the budget bill and the house is expected to vote next week on 
federally subsidized child care and the catastrophic illness 
insurance plan 
on the catastrophic illness issue the house will choose between 
restructuring the tax program which has drawn ire from the elderly 
sharply scaling back the program in order to repeal the income 
surtax or to kill the program entirely 
on wednesday the house voted probusiness on a pair of issues 
generating controversy in that community 
by a vote of 250173 it killed a provision in the bill which 
would have given workers representation on the boards of 
companyfinanced pension plans 
then by a 39036 margin it voted to repeal a 1986 provision 
that prohibits employers from claiming tax deductions for health 
plans that discriminate against lowerpaid workers

the makers of liquid paper agreed 
today to remove a cancercausing ingredient and pay 300000 in 
penalties and costs to settle a legal action brought by 
environmentalists 
the settlement filed in superior court was prompted by 
complaints that gillette co was exposing users to a cancercausing 
chemical in the typewriter correction fluid without the warning 
required by proposition 65 
that measure passed by voters in 1986 requires products 
containing chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive harm to 
carry warnings 
under the settlement liquid paper products will contain no 
trichloroethylene or tce within four months 
the company agreed to pay a 275000 penalty and 25000 in fees 
and costs the penalty will rise to 1 million if the deadline is 
not met 
the company will run advertisements about the chemicals and 
nontoxic alternatives such as liquid paper mistake out and liquid 
paper just for copies the ads will also tell consumers they can 
exchange their liquid paper for the nontoxic alternatives 
tce makes liquid paper dry faster 
david roe of the environmental defense fund one of the authors 
of proposition 65 praised gillette for acting very quickly and 
responsibly in finding a new way to make these products that avoids 
proposition 65 chemicals

grain and soybean futures prices gained thursday 
on the chicago board of trade led by a late surge in the corn 
market amid rumors the soviet union was seeking to buy as much as 3 
million metric tons of us corn or sorghum 
analysts also cited talk that the soviets recently purchased 
grain from canada and soybean meal from south america after 
indicating earlier this month that they would import no more grain 
this year 
the markets found further support in other grainexport news 
including a sale of 400000 metric tons of us corn to mexico and 
a chinese bid for 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
the sudden wave of foreign demand is a sharp contrast to the 
slow export activity of recent weeks 
compared to last week this is a megaincrease said william 
biedermann director of research with allendale inc a futures 
brokerage in crystal lake ill 
at the close wheat futures were cent to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 399 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 5 cents higher with december at 234 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 145 a bushel 
soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with november at 570 a

opec ministers failed to end a nasty fight over 
how to divide up oilmarket shares but made some headway in laying 
the groundwork for the cartels scheduled meeting in november 
analysts said thursday 
it was a very important meeting said joseph stanislaw 
managing director of cambridge energy research associates in paris 
questions they didnt want to face at least got put on the table 
for consideration 
one eleventhhour proposal by iran to revamp existing quotas 
for example was viewed by many as having sufficient merit to 
warrant further discussion at the upcoming meeting scheduled for 
nov 25 in vienna 
it opened a possible avenue for solving the quota problem 
said opec president rilwanu lukman nigerias oil minister 
bahman karbassioun an oil consultant based in vienna called 
the plan a first step 
they have a much better chance of getting somewhere in 
november he said 
the ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries ended five days of sometimes acrimonious 
discussions wednesday by agreeing to increase their supply ceiling 
a modest amount in the fourth quarter 
in the absence of a consensus on how to carve up opecs 
production share to please all the countries a plan was announced 
to simply bump up the supply ceiling from 195 million barrels a 
day to 205 million barrels in the octoberdecember period 
analysts said the decision aimed at lifting prices of opec 
crude about a dollar to their target of 18 a barrel simply 
legitimized part of the 225 million barrels a day the cartel is 
believed to be producing already it also more accurately reflects 
the rising world demand for opec oil 
however the meeting was sufficiently divisive that a final 
statement normally given at the close of opec meetings was not 
issued 
they didnt release a communique because not all of the 
ministers would sign one said rick donovan head of global 
energy for shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
more importantly the ministers held serious discussions about 
ways to divvy up their oil production shares to everyones 
satisfaction according to some analysts 
it was a surprise the ministers actually got into a lot of 
issues they did said stanislaw 
iran unveiled its proposal on tuesday four days after the 
meeting began and ministers extended their stay in geneva to 
examine it the plan would raise opecs output cap to 215 million 
barrels a day to meet the demands primarily of kuwait and the 
united arab emirates for bigger production shares 
the two countries have been openly ignoring their assigned 
quotas in an effort to press their demands for a redistribution of 
their individual supply quotas kuwaits quota is 109 million 
barrels and the uaes is 104 million but both are believed to 
be producing about twice their allotment 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh speaking to reporters 
through a translator said his plan would be a basis to solve the 
problems of opec hopefully for good 
everyone was taken with it said john lichtblau of the 
petroleum industry research foundation in new york theres a lot 
of momentum behind it 
aqazadeh said his plan was designed to meet the dual requests of 
big producers in the persian gulf to produce more and those of 
smaller ones for higher prices 
the large producing countries could guarantee some sort of 
price for the others he said 
in exchange the smaller producers who complain that 
overproduction hurts prices would give up some of their output 
shares to the bigger ones 
specifically the plan called for a marked increase in the 
production slices of kuwait the united arab emirates gabon and 
ecuador the shares of saudi arabia qatar and libya would stay the 
same 
iran and iraq would lose a bit and algeria nigeria indonesia 
and venezuela would lose more 
libya opposed the plan because it wants the same share as kuwait 
analysts predict oil prices will hold relatively steady or 
weaken slightly in the next few months gasoline prices at the pump 
could slip depending on the cartels production pattern but the 
new ceiling is not likely to affect actual output they said 
the november meeting is designed to plot production strategy for 
1990 
our hope is that in the meantime nobody does anything silly to 
upset the good atmosphere which we have now said lukman 
if tempers dont flare he said well be in a good mood to 
finalize it

shocked braniff passengers scrambled 
thursday for alternate flights while airline employees worried 
about their future following the companys second filing for 
bankruptcy protection in seven years 
only one flight was scheduled thursday evening between braniff 
incs major kansas city mo hub and dallas after the company 
sought protection from creditors to allow it to reorganize under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
i have flown them so often before and my daughter sent me 
these tickets said marcia mack of new york city i was so 
shocked i have always enjoyed flying braniff 
she was among dozens of worried passengers who waited at 
braniffs ticket counters when its concourse at dallasfort worth 
international airport opened at 6 am cdt 
in kansas city city convention planners were struggling to 
arrange transportation for delegates from two conventions in town 
and for about 1200 delegates expected next week for a convention 
of the society of broadcast engineers 
the city may have trouble attracting future conventions if 
convenient air travel is not available officials of other airlines 
said it was too early to tell if they would increase their flights 
from kansas city international airport 
meanwhile some employees were confident that braniff which 
laid off 2700 workers could rebuild as a smaller carrier 
braniff filed for bankruptcy protection at 2 am edt in 
orlando its home base only hours after it canceled flights 
through orlando and the kansas city hub rumors of a bankruptcy 
filing drove the airlines stock price down earlier on wednesday 
we knew there was some financial trouble but we didnt 
realize the severity of it said chuck skinner a braniff agent 
who went through the airlines first chapter 11 proceeding in 1982 
the latest filing really surprised us 
however he predicted braniff would return probably as a much 
smaller carrier 
i am sure we will end up flying out of this one said 
skinner 
braniff will schedule three daily flights out of dallas 
beginning monday presumably to kansas city said al van klies 
one of five braniff agents processing tickets at dallasfort worth 
airport 
employees hadnt yet been told about staffing at the airport 
i think the older people here will still have a job van 
klies said 
the agent who worked at braniff during its first 
reorganization expected that the second would be similar 
today were just booking people on different flights he 
said as he scheduled a passenger on dallasbased american airlines 
cliff baker of plainfield nj whose ticket was honored by 
american said he and his wife ann were returning from a threeweek 
vacation when braniff unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy protection 
we heard about it last night on the news one guy at our hotel 
was trying all night to get braniff and finally did about 3 am 
they told us to come out and get rescheduled and we did he said 
baker said he has been a loyal braniff customer since 1958 when 
he rode the carrier out of san antonio texas during tours at 
lackland and brooks air force bases 
they are a great airline baker 49 said i hope they 
come back 
lou antabades of grand prairie texas another passenger said 
he had a premonition as he bought a special braniff ticket to watch 
the fall leaves turn colors in the rocky mountains 
when they offered the 149 roundtrip fair to denver my first 
images were the tv screens at the airport showing all flights had 
been canceled like they had during the first bankruptcy 
reorganization said antabades but i said no that wont 
happen again

the former head of braniff inc who piloted 
the airline through bankruptcy court seven years ago on thursday 
blamed changes by subsequent management for landing the company 
back in chapter 11 
you could see it coming howard d putnam braniffs former 
chief executive said in an interview 
they took on a lot of debt he said they began a gigantic 
expansion in kansas city and they began to lose money they had 
been known as a lowfare airline and became a highfare airline 
they got out of their niche 
putnam said he tried to remake braniff in the style of southwest 
airlines co a dallas airline he led as president southwest 
stressed high employee productivity high utilization of planes 
low fares and high quality service 
chicago businessman and hotelier jay pritzker bought braniff in 
1983 as it was emerging from bankruptcy court and altered that 
strategy putnam said pritzker sold the orlando flabased 
airline in 1988 to investors led by jeffrey chodorow of 
philadelphia 
they in turn brought in new senior management putnam said 
some of the management were from piedmont airlines which is in 
a different part of the country with little competition and higher 
rates 
they had first class and it seems logical im assuming to 
management that since it worked back there it should work for 
braniff he said 
but braniff early thursday filed for protection from creditors 
under federal brankruptcy laws off 2700 employees and sharply 
reduced its flying schedule 
the airline said that while it believes assets have 
substantial value it was suffering a liquidity problem because 
of delays in completing recently announced financing and a dropoff 
in airline traffic in recent months 
putnam who was in town to address university of pittsburgh 
graduate business students on ethics said braniff now must 
restructure their way out of it 
the saddest part about braniff is the employees putnam 
said when we reorganized the employees took wage cuts of 40 to 
50 percent for five years in order for the company to come back 
theyve done their part 
upon filing under chapter 11 in may 1982 braniff suspended 
operations laying off about 10000 employees and leaving only 225 
on the job he said within two weeks the company also laid off 22 
vice presidents and eliminated two levels of management 
a bankruptcy judge gave the company permission to dissolve its 
labor contracts and seek concessions from workers putnam said the 
pay cuts were easier to achieve because the employees were laid off 
i had no problems with that ethically because we were 
already in chapter 11 and the only way we could come out is if we 
had some more productive labor rates he said 
i got them to understand that i was their last hope putnam 
added i didnt tell them i was going to cut their salaries any 
more i just said we needed more productivity

drugmaker merck amp co will let du pont co 
market two of its drugs in exchange for a chance to help du pont 
develop and sell a new class of potential high blood pressure 
medicines 
the unusual arrangement announced by both companies on thursday 
grants merck access to du ponts new development while giving du 
pont the expertise merck has in research and shepherding drugs to 
market the pact also fills a void in ei du pont de nemours and 
cos drug pipeline 
its trading current products for future products said 
david bartash an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
the pairing off comes during a time of increasing global 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical world as drug makers merge or 
join forces to sell products 
du pont is seeking to expand in pharmaceuticals and bartash 
said it may have entered into the pact to speed up the process 
theyve been spending money for a long time on drug 
development and they havent got a whole lot to show for it he 
said 
pharmaceutical revenue last year accounted for about 1 percent 
of the revenue of wilmington delbased du pont or 350 million 
out of its 329 billion in sales 
the agreement calls for merck to take the lead in developing one 
of du ponts most promising drug discoveries blockers that 
interfere with a hormone that induces high blood pressure 
the companies will share revenues from such a drug which merck 
spokesman john doorley said could be introduced in the mid1990s 
in the deals other aspect merck said it would turn over 
exclusive north american marketing rights to du pont for sinemet a 
major treatment for parkinsons disease sales of the drug 
introduced last year exceeded 100 million 
rahwaybased mercks total revenues for the year were 594 
billion leading to earnings of 12 billion 
du pont will also assume marketing of vaseretic called 
corenitec in some european countries a highblood pressure 
medicine that merck introduced in 1987 vaseretic is a combination 
of mercks popular vasotec and its diuretic hydrodiuril 
merck said the arrangement will allow it to focus marketing 
energies on other products 
marketing collaborations between drug makers are frequent but 
more usually involve one company helping sell anothers drug 
rather than turning over the entire marketing task said du pont 
spokesman roger morris 
youre trying to leverage new projects with as many sales 
people as you can said louis c webb an analyst with advest 
inc of hartford conn 
the exchange of existing drugs for access to research is also 
unusual analysts said 
merck will receive an undisclosed percentage of the proceeds 
from vaseretic and sinemet 
morris said du pont wanted sinemet because it already had 
experience selling a parkinsons drug and liked vaseretic because 
the company was interested in expanding its cardiology line both 
are generating rising sales falling between a number of mature 
du pont drugs with expired patents and others far from hitting the 
market said morris 
together the companies will work on a new class of high blood 
pressure drugs called angiotensin ii receptor antagonists 
angiotensin ii or aii is a blood pressure hormone that binds 
to receptor sites on blood cells and tissue the antagonists 
reach the sites first blocking the hormone and keeping blood 
pressure down 
the companies said the treatment is particularly safe because it 
acts on a very specific part of body chemistry the compounds are 
in human test trials said the companies 
morris said that with mercks participation a drug could be on 
the market about two years sooner 
merck known for its strong research department also gains 
theyre smart enough to know they cant discover everything 
said bartash but he said a previous similar arrangement with the 
british imperial chemical industries has yet to produce fruit 
merck in 1986 allowed ici to share marketing of a high blood 
pressure drug in exchange for codevelopment of a compound to treat 
diabetes side effects merck spokesman don burkat said the drug was 
still in development

speculation that the soviet union was shopping for up to 3 million 
metric tons of us corn

soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with november at 570 a

the rumors of buying interest conflicted with recent soviet 
statements that the soviets would not import any more grain in 
1989 but market analysts said those statements probably were a 
ruse to drive prices lower 
they know how to play the game said walter spilka a grain 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
ask the soviets if theyre going to buy corn theyll say no 
the price goes down 2 cents and then theyll buy it 
supporting the rumors were indications the soviets recently 
purchased grain from canada and soybean meal from south america 
the markets also were boosted by other grainexport news 
including confirmed sales of 106000 metric tons of us corn to 
mexico and 215000 metric tons of us corn to japan plus a 
chinese bid for 400000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
the sudden wave of foreign demand is a sharp contrast to the 
slow export activity of recent weeks 
compared to last week this is a megaincrease said william 
biedermann director of research with allendale inc a futures 
brokerage in crystal lake ill 
after the close the agriculture department released its 
quarterly grainstocks report which indicated corn and soybean 
supplies were larger and wheat supplies smaller than the market had 
expected

yearago stocks of 302 million 
corn stocks as of sept 1 were estimated at 193 billion bushels 
compared to trade estimates averaging 189 billion and yearago

billion bushels essentially unchanged from a year ago compared to 
trade estimates averaging 199 billion

paced by sharp gains in the october gasoline contract linked to

million barrels from 195 million 
it seems to me that those writing opec off yesterday 
recognized today they made a fair amount of progress in recognizing 
what their objectives ought to be said robert baker energy

energy futures prices rose in moderate trading 
thursday reflecting general optimism that opecs latest accord 
would not mean higher oil production or weaker prices 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries concluded a 
fiveday meeting on wednesday by increasing its stated production 
ceiling to 205 million barrels a day from 195 million 
analysts said the higher quota more accurately reflects the 
demand for opec oil and should help maintain relatively stable 
prices through the fourth quarter without raising actual production 
although there is disappointment in the outcome people 
realize that demand is still running at a high level said tom 
bentz director of futures trading at united energy inc 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil rose 27 
cents to finish at 1986 a 42gallon barrel the contract gained 6 
cents in wednesdays session 
among refined products unleaded gasoline for october delivery 
jumped 219 cents to close at 6093 cents a gallon analysts said 
lastminute buying the day before trading on the contract expires 
helped boost prices the november contract rose 105 cents to 5796 
cents a gallon and other contracts posted much smaller gains 
heating oil for october delivery rose 040 cent to settle at 
5886 cents a gallon and the contract for november delivery gained 
030 cent to 5920 cents 
the feeling in the market right now is that opec made strides 
in trying to hammer out something it sets a good groundwork for 
the nov 21 meeting said linda simard energy broker at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
crude prices should hold fairly steady between now and the 
meeting she said 
opec is scheduled to meet in vienna in november to map out 
strategy for 1990 observers say the oil group may be in a better 
position after the current session to deal with the quota issue 
although opec raised its official ceiling it remains under the 
cartels actual production estimated by various industry sources 
at about 225 million barrels a day analysts said they expect the 
cartel to raise the figure to a more realistic level at the 
november conference

dunkin donuts officials say they are 
looking more closely at a merger offer from a canadian partnership 
after rejecting a bid by the same group earlier this month 
the international doughnut chain is also considering other 
alternatives including a leveraged buyout or selling the company 
to a third party 
in a letter sent monday to the chains 1108 franchisees robert 
m rosenberg chairman and chief executive officer wrote that 
dunkin donuts management met sept 19 with representatives of dd 
acquisition corp which had made a bid for the company in august 
dd acquisition corp is a partnership between cara operations 
ltd a restaurant franchise company and kingsbridge capital 
group the merchant banking arm of toronto investor george manns 
unicorp canada corp 
the letter said dds increased cash offer of 45 a share or 
308 million along with its willingness to drop most conditions 
previously imposed in the deal had prompted the meeting 
dd acquisition raised its offer late last month from 43 but 
dunkin donuts announced two weeks ago that it would reject the 
higher offer 
dd had filed suit in delaware chancery court challenging a 
serious of tough antitakeover defenses dunkin donuts had 
implemented rosenbergs letter said that dd had agreed to drop its 
suit and its challenge of all measures except a poisonpill 
plan dunkin donuts had implemented 
the poison pill increases the number of shares in the event of a 
takeover making a merger prohibitively expensive 
the letter said dd acquisition had extended its tender offer to 
nov 1 
rosenberg also wrote that dunkin donuts was meeting with other 
possible buyers and also might consider a leveraged buyout plan 
in a leveraged buyout the asset value of a company is used to 
finance most or all of the debt 
whether or not an lbo might be pursued and might be in the 
best interests of the stockholders has not yet been determined 
the letter read but the possibility of financial support from 
franchise owners is likely to play an important role in our 
evaluation of the lbo alternative 
company officials would not comment on the letter 
dunkin donuts reported a 34 percent drop in thirdquarter 
earnings much of which it attributed to costs associated with 
battling the hostile takeover

kaiser permanente of southern 
california a health maintenance organization with 2 million 
members said thursday it will raise rates by about 17 percent 
next year 
the monthly cost of the average individual premium will rise 
from 8990 a month to 10499 a month spokeswoman janice seib 
said family plans with two members are twice that amount or 
20998 for three or more 29733 per month 
ms seib said tyhe increase was the largest in the last five 
years she blamed rising medical costs the need to add doctors and 
staff big increases in membership that have strained the company 
and the fact that our membership is aging 
hmos offer members medical care for a prepaid fixed price 
rather than on a paypervisit basis 
on tuesday kaiser permanente of northern california said it 
would hike rates 196 percent next year 
kaiser a nonprofit medical institute is the nations largest 
hmo it operates nine medical centers and a mental health center in 
southern california 
james doherty president of the group health association of 
america a washington dcbased trade group for hmos said many of 
the groups have lost money in recent years as premium increases 
have failed to keep pace with the rising costs of providing service 
a recent national survey of 650 hmos by group health showed 
individual premiums rose 118 percent and family premiums rose 116 
percent from 1987 to 1988

the maker of liquid paper correction 
fluid agreed thursday to remove a cancercausing ingredient and pay 
300000 to settle a legal action brought by environmentalists 
under the agreement filed in san francisco superior court 
gillette co can continue to sell liquid paper containing the 
carcinogen until march 1 1990 but must allow customers to 
exchange bottles for nontoxic alternatives 
the settlement was prompted by complaints that gillette was 
exposing users to a cancercausing chemical in the typewriter 
correction fluid without the warning required by state law 
proposition 65 
this is the way proposition 65 was intended to work not 
through endless legal battles but by providing manufacturers with 
a strong incentive to stop using toxic chemicals in their 
products california attorney general john van de kamp said 
proposition 65 passed by voters in november 1986 requires 
warnings on products that contain chemicals known to cause cancer 
or reproductive harm 
van de kamp said the case is the first in which a manufacturer 
had changed its product to avoid being subject to a proposition 65 
enforcement action 
under the agreement bostonbased gillette does not admit any 
violation and is reformulating some of its products to avoid 
prolonged litigation and to eliminate further confusion and 
controversy said a statement issued by a public relations firm 
representing the firm 
the manufacturers of liquid paper are confident its products 
pose no health risks to consumers and meet all federal government 
safety standards the statement said 
environmental groups earlier this month contended that liquid 
paper a whiteout fluid used for correcting typing mistakes 
was not warning customers that some products contain 
trichloroethylene or tce and lead tce is on the states 
proposition 65 list as a carcinogen and lead as a reproductive 
toxin 
the groups noted that not only dont liquid paper bottles 
contain a warning but they also say nonhazardous when used as 
directed 
the firm was relying on a tollfree 800number posted in stores 
that consumers could call to get information on the product 
van de kamp said only two persons received the liquid paper 
warning message by making calls in the first year of the 800 
number a sacramento county superior court judge last month ruled 
the 800 number was an inadequate warning system but an industry 
group is appealing the decision 
the agreement pertains to the following liquid paper correction 
fluids bond white stock colors thinner pen and ink special 
match and paper mate office products 
gillette said it would place newspaper advertisements around 
california informing consumers the products contain the chemical 
and they can exchange bottles for some nontoxic alternative 
products the waterbased substitutes are liquid paper just for 
copies opaquing fluid and liquid paper mistake out 
gillette also will pay the state 275000 in civil penalties and 
25000 in attorneys fees and costs which go to the 
environmentalist groups that brought the complaint 
if the company manufactures the carcinogencontaining product 
after next feb 1 or sells it after march 1 it will have to pay an 
additional 50000 a month in penalties to a maximum of 1 million 
david roe of environmental defense fund praised gillette for 
acting very quickly and responsibly in finding a new way to make 
these products that avoids proposition 65 chemicals 
this sets a precedent for getting casual carcinogens out of 
our daily lives roe said

assurances thursday it could implement plans to save 100 million 
in annual interest costs by refinancing old longterm debts 
without jeopardizing access to shortterm federal loans 
the us treasury agreed to give the giant utility a twoyear 
2 billion line of credit from the federal financing bank while it 
attempts to refinance 67 billion in highinterest ffb loans 
through the public markets 
the deal permits tva to go after the very large savings that 
weve been trying to achieve the past four months through our 
refinancing said william malec tvas chief financial officer 
us rep don sundquist rtenn said the agreement was reached 
thursday after discussions between federal regulators in washington 
and tva chairman marvin runyon 
malec said tva planned to go to market with its first debt 
refinancing issue at least 1 billion of the 67 billion in 
the second week of october and expected to have the remainder 
refinanced over the next six months 
tvas objective is to cut its annual operating expenses by 
reducing the interest costs on its longterm debt the average 
interest rate on the 67 billion tva wants to refinance is 1225 
percent tva believes it can secure rates of around 9 percent from 
public credit markets 
debt interest represents tvas single largest annual expense 
currently 18 billion a year or 34 cents for every dollar needed 
to operate the power system 
by refinancing the 67 billion in old debt at lower interest 
rates the tva expects to save 100 million a year 
treasury officials suggested in may that tva go to wall street 
to refinance its old ffb loans but last month said if the utility 
proceeded with the plan it would prohibit tva from seeking 
longterm loans from the ffb in the future 
the tva did not want to lose this access having borrowed 173 
billion from the ffb since 1974 
malec said thursdays agreement does not address new longterm 
ffb borrowing but does allow tva to go to the ffb for up to 2 
billion in shortterm borrowing to meet operating obligations over 
the next two years 
tva will lump any longterm financing needs into other public 
bond issues through 1991 he said at the end of the twoyear 
period treasury will review the agreement and decide whether it 
again will offer longterm financing

borden inc thursday announced a doublepronged 
program that will cut its work force by about 15 percent and 
substantially shrink its dairy business symbolized for decades by 
elsie the cow 
the program which will mean the cutting of 7000 jobs comes 
after several years of acquisitions which added 31 billion to 
bordens annual sales 
under the plan announced at a new york news conference borden 
will take a 571 million pretax charge against its thirdquarter 
income resulting in a quarterly loss of 300 million to 305 
million and a loss of 47 million to 58 million for the full year 
the onetime charge amounting to about 404 million after 
taxes will be used to consolidate bordens six business lines the 
goal is to cut costs and boost pretax profit by some 340 million 
through 1993 
borden which also is a leader in the pasta wall coverings and 
glue businesses also intends to pull out of overcrowded dairy 
markets and concentrate on those where it has been doing well 
borden says it will retain its ranking as the worlds biggest dairy 
business even after it reduces its operations by a third or by 
700 million to 750 in annual sales 
romeo j ventres bordens chairman and chief executive officer 
said 65 of the companys 265 plants worldwide will be closed or 
sold over the next two to three years 
ventres said the plants to be closed and the dairy markets to be 
exited will be identified later bordens weaker markets generally 
are in the east and southeast and the stronger ones are in the 
south and west ventres said 
he said borden would make every effort to sell the plants as 
going concerns and local management will be given the first crack 
at buying them 
bordens program will reduce its worldwide employment by about 
7000 from the present 46000 employees will be notified in 
advance of closings and job retraining will be offered to anyone 
wanting it the company said 
twenty of the closings will involve dairy plants and branches to 
be sold or closed in nongrowth areas 
ventres said borden will remain committed to dairy markets where 
it enjoys strong growth 
were very committed to elsie he said you may say 
elsies gone on a little diet here but shell be with us 
ventres said referring to the cow that has been a symbol for borden 
since she was introduced at the 1939 worlds fair in new york 
bordens exhibit depicted a dairy of the future featuring elsie 
in a barnyard boudoir her mate elmer the bull made his debut at 
the following years fair and filled the job of spokesman for 
bordens adhesives 
outside of dairy many of the planned closings will involve 
smaller or older plants where production will be shifted to larger 
more modern ones 
securities analysts were unsurprised by bordens restructuring 
plans given that the company had been on an ambitious acquisition 
campaign borden has acquired 77 businesses since 1986 mostly in 
the food and consumer products area that added 31 billion to 
annual sales 
borden stock rose 225 to 3675 a share on the new york stock 
exchange 
some analysts regard borden as a hodgepodge of businesses that 
might do better disengaged in retrospect a few analysts said 
borden should have set aside money for consolidations while it was 
on its buying spree 
a typical wall street comment came from william leach of 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities inc he said its 
definitely a good thing but he added im not jumping up and 
down 
ventres said the goal of the consolidation in dairy and its 
other planned moves is to make borden a lowcost producer in each 
of its six main businesses by 1992 
borden says it is the worlds leading producer in pasta dairy 
wallcoverings and forest products adhesives it claims to be no2 
in salty snacks 
some of bordens bestknown brands include wise chips and 
snacks such as cheez doodles eagle brand dairy products catelli 
pasta and classico tomato sauce it also makes elmers glue and 
various paints and varnishes

japans government is trying to keep japanese 
companies from participating in a global futures trading network 
being developed by the chicago mercantile exchange according to 
published reports 
the ministry of finance fears that when the mercs system 
called globex begins operating later this year japanese firms 
will forsake tokyos fledgling futures markets to trade financial 
futures on globex the chicago tribune reported thursday 
the japanese news service nikkei telecom reported last week that 
the ministry had persuaded mitsui trust amp banking co to withdraw 
its application to install globex terminals 
an employee at mitsuis new york branch said no one was 
available thursday to comment on the reports 
chicago merc spokeswoman julie jacobs said the exchanges 
position had not changed since friday when spokesman andrew yemma 
had denied any knowledge of the finance ministrys discouraging 
globex participation 
indeed all our information is quite to the contrary yemma 
said it sounds like pure speculation 
nick ronalds deputy managing director of the mercs tokyo 
office said the merc had heard nothing official from the finance 
ministry which has been studying globex for more than a year 
weve provided them with all the information and we are still 
waiting for their response he said 
globex designed to facilitate global 24hour futures trading 
would be weakened without the participation of the japanese who 
opened their own futures markets in june 
one of those markets the tokyo international financial futures 
exchange offers eurodollar futures which are widely used by 
institutional investors for hedging international investments 
eurodollar futures are the mercs most popular product and they 
will likely be offered for trading on globex 
the tribune quoted an unidentified tokyobased us trade 
official as saying the finance ministrys intervention represented 
another example of the mighty hammer of japanese bureaucracy 
crashing down on the concept of free trade

friendly

the airline his term as chairman was marked by long contract 
battles with the airlines three principal unions but all three 
groups now are under longterm pacts

anheuserbusch cos inc announced thursday it 
had agreed to pay 11 billion for the four sea world parks around 
the country plus two other theme parks from harcourt brace 
jovanovich inc 
the deal will make anheuserbusch the second largest theme park 
operator in america behind walt disney co and will help harcourt 
pay off the massive debt it accumulated in thwarting a hostile 
takeover two years ago 
we think this acquisition is a very logical move for 
anheuserbusch said august a busch iii chairman and president 
of the company we have been involved in the family entertainment 
industry for the last 30 years and it is a business we know well 
the purchase was expected to be completed in november 
anheuserbusch the worlds leading brewery operates busch 
gardens in tampa fla one of the biggest four zoos in the 
country a 17th century europeanstyle park in williamsburg va a 
water park in tampa and a futuristic childrens park near 
philadelphia 
the company also is planning a major theme park and resort along 
the spanish mediterranean coast just south of barcelona according 
to vicki pearlman a spokeswoman for anheuserbusch the park is 
scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993 
family entertainment is one of anheuserbuschs four core 
businesses along with beer food and container manufacturing 
the popular sea world parks which feature performing killer 
whales such as the famous shamu trained dolphins and other sea 
creatures are located in san diego orlando fla san antonio 
texas and aurora ohio 
the other parks involved in the deal are boardwalk and baseball 
in orlando and cypress gardens in winter haven fla the purchase 
also includes land surrounding the three florida parks and sea 
world of texas 
in new york stock exchange trading thursday anheuserbusch 
stock closed up 62 cents at 4225 while harcourt brace rose 62 
cents to close at 1625 
analysts say orlandobased harcourt brace jovanovich a leading 
book publisher is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a 
nearly 29 billion debt it accumulated in fending off a 1987 
hostile takeover attempt by british communications mogul robert 
maxwell 
they harcourt brace didnt have a whole lot of choice 
said robert dunlap jr analyst for brown brothers harriman in new 
york 
but in giving up the theme park business harcourt brace also is 
relieving itself of the chronic management problems and falling 
attendance at the six parks 
attendance at the six parks dropped nearly 5 percent last year 
due in part to bad weather but the decline has continued this 
year a company spokesman said 
in 1988 sales at the parks were 388 million and pretax 
earnings were 62 million anheuserbusch said this year pretax 
earnings were projected to rise to 90 million analysts said 
although published reports earlier this month identified 
anheuserbusch as the likely buyer of the parks only two bidders 
for the park actually went public with their plans one was a group 
of former harcourt brace and sea world executives led by sea world 
founder george millay the other was from florida leisure 
acquisition corp which owns the silver springs attraction in 
ocala 
harcourt brace has been in the theme park business for 13 years 
the purchase price of 11 billion includes 975 million for the 
theme parks and the rest for the harcourt braces land holdings 
the agreement also calls for harcourt brace to receive half of the

of datapoint corps board of directors claimed thursday that 
chairman asher b edelman illegally bought stock in the computer 
company to thwart the takeover attempt 
the lawsuit filed in delaware chancery court claims 
datapoints edelmancontrolled board illegally changed the record 
date of a solicitation order in order to give edelman and 
associates time to buy enough stock to block martin s ackermans 
effort to oust the board 
edelman a takeover specialist increased his holdings in 
datapoint to more than 40 percent through stock purchases during a 
twoday period shortly after ackerman announced his plan to replace 
the board

breach of their corporate duties as directors and restricted 
stockholders from taking action by written consent for the primary 
purpose of entrenching edelman and other directors in the 
management of datapoint 
the suit is a response to a lawsuit filed earlier this month by 
edelman 
ackerman began the takeover attempt earlier this month saying 
edelman was responsible for more than 126 million in stock 
declines and losses at san antoniobased datapoint which has about 
330 million in annual sales and employs about 2600 people

struggled with recent operating losses announced thursday it has a 
negative net worth and is anticipating a huge thirdquarter loss 
the savings bank said it will continue to operate normally and 
that the projected losses will have no effect on the banks 
customers employees or vendors 
president and chief executive officer kent dixon while 
conceding that the elimination of shareholders equity through a 
negative net worth was of great concern said the bank would 
continue to provide the high quality of service which our 
customers have come to expect 
in july when the bank announced a secondquarter loss of 542 
million dixon predicted that continuing losses would eat up its 
common shareholders equity by the end of this year but in a news

billion in auto loans it wrote though car dealers 
in november 1986 when the bank first sold stock publicly its 
shares fetched 562 the stock closed thursday at 36 cents a share 
the basic definition of stockholders equity would be the 
assets of the corporation minus its liabilities said analyst 
bill ripple if the liabilities exceed the assets there is 
really no stockholders equity theres no more net worth in the 
corporation therefore the value of the stock is zero 
the bank is operating under an agreement with federal regulators 
to get out of several risky lending businesses and to emphasize its 
traditional home mortgage lending 
an analyst for the first albany corp donald kauth estimated 
this summer in a research report that empire needed to raise 890 
million by 1994 to meet federal capital requirements
