in a solemn centuriesold rite at the imperial 
palace emperor akihito acceded to the chrysanthemum throne on 
monday becoming the first japanese monarch enthroned as a symbol 
and not a living god 
leftist radicals launched 25 separate attacks aimed at 
disrupting the ceremony police said they fired missiles at five 
military bases including a us naval base and set fires at 
religious shrines and train stations none of the attacks caused 
injuries 
a massive national security operation involving thousands of 
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of 
visiting dignitaries 
akihito wearing a redbrown silk kimono of ancient design sat 
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an imperial palace 
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords 
he vowed to uphold japans modern constitution which 
fundamentally restructures the worlds oldest hereditary monarchy 
on this occasion i pledge anew that i shall observe the 
constitution of japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the 
state and of the unity of the people akihito speaking in 
colloquial japanese told about 2500 guests in the heavily guarded 
palace 
seated on her own throne at akihitos side was empress michiko 
also dressed in full imperial regalia 
under the cloudless skies gong and drum attendants played 
haunting court music for royal family officials and guests 
dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included vice 
president dan quayle and britains prince charles and princess 
diana 
the ceremony ended with prime minister toshiki kaifu dressed in 
swallowtail coat leading the japanese guests in three cries of 
banzai a wish for long life he led the cheers from a spot 
level with the throne to underscore the constitutions emphasis on 
popular sovereignty 
following the enthronement akihito and empress michiko were to 
change into western clothes and travel in an open car from the 
imperial palace to the akasaka palace three miles away officials 
said nearly 10000 police would line the route which passes in 
front of japans parliament 
akihito had begun his morning rituals by offering private 
prayers at three wooden shrines inside the imperial palace to 
announce his enthronement to the sun goddess and ancestors 
critics say the 30minute ceremony and a series of 
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks are based too 
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for akihitos 
father and grandfather who were enthroned as divinities 
japans postwar constitution stipulates that the emperor is 
simply a national symbol 
in one controversial element of the rite akihitos raised dais 
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess from 
whom tradition says the japanese imperial line is descended 
critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity 
the government is reportedly spending 95 million on the rites 
much of it for security opponents say state funding of the 
ceremonies linked to japans indigenous shinto religion violates 
the constitutional separation of religion and state 
the radical left has been particularly incensed because of the 
legacy of imperial militarism in japan 
the projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the 
military and at a base in western tokyo police said no damage was 
reported 
another missile was fired outside the us naval base at atsugi 
24 miles southwest of tokyo 
three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines and in 
separate incidents two major subway lines were shut down because 
of smoke 
among the other attacks police listed were fires that broke out 
at four shinto shrines in tokyo including one less than a mile 
from akihitos residence two shrines were destroyed 
the attacks including 19 in tokyo caused little other damage 
police said 
on sunday two bombs exploded at the house of us consul 
general gregory l johnson in nishinomiya in western japan police 
said they caused little damage and no injuries it was not 
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the 
enthronement 
a record 37000 police including reinforcements from a majority 
of japans 47 prefectures have been mobilized for security 
surrounding the rite security was particularly heavy around the 
downtown palace 
the government has not released the names of japanese 
dignitaries invited to the ceremony because of fear of radical 
attacks on their homes or businesses 
traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in 
areas around the palace but few tieups were reported in part 
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many 
tokyoites took advantage of the threeday weekend to leave town 
airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity 
akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father 
emperor hirohito in january 1989 but a period of mourning was 
observed before his formal enthronement 
akihito 56 was tutored after world war ii by an american 
pacifist and is the first emperor in modern japanese history to 
marry a commoner he and the empress also raised their three 
children themselves rather than have them raised separately by 
aides as was the imperial custom 
as with hirohitos funeral which was attended by 
representatives of 164 nations the enthronement provided 
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings kaifu was 
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials 
on monday evening the first of seven banquets scheduled over 
five days is to be held at the imperial palace with senior 
japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending

david lynch and mark frost pulled off a neat 
trick on twin peaks they revealed laura palmers murderer to 
viewers but neither fbi agent dale cooper nor sheriff harry s 
truman was in on the solution 
if we can trust our eyes a gamble in the weird and wild world 
of twin peaks then lauras father killed her and is about to 
kill her lookalike cousin 
unless of course cooper kyle maclachlan figures out a vision 
he sees at a bar and saves the day 
faithful viewers have come to expect virtually nothing to be 
what it seems in twin peaks a picturesque but dark little logging 
town in the pacific northwest 
and nothing was even as it seemed at abc the network had 
already promised twice to reveal the killer first in last 
seasons finale and then during the twohour season premiere in 
september before coming through on saturday during television 
sweeps 
a shadowy longhaired man named bob whom viewers have seen 
only through characters visions has been placed at the murder 
scene apparently bludgeoning laura 
ok so then whats going on it had been hinted that bob may be 
a demonic force requiring a human host does leland think hes bob 
does he have two personalities why can some people see bob and 
some only see leland 
theres still suspense left twin peaks fans and plenty of 
plots not to worry 
what of cooper and truman michael ontkean after all this 
work they arrested somebody else 
in saturdays episode benjamin horne just minutes after 
telling his own daughter he had been in love with homecoming queen 
laura was hauled off for questioning in the murder 
the debonaire but dastardly dad was always a good candidate for 
killer what with his ownership of a brothel his sexual wanderings 
and dealings with drug dealers 
leland too was an early favorite suspect among peaks 
freaks one theory had it that he had molested his daughter 
driving her to drugs and kinky sex and unable to stand what hed 
done he killed her 
elements of that theory may prove true based on hints in 
lauras diary and leland has already been charged as leland not 
bob with killing another character 
lynch directed saturday nights episode and wearing a trench 
coat to match coopers appeared as gordon cole coopers 
hardofhearing boss 
his show could use some help in the ratings according to the 
latest ac nielsen co numbers the series was third in its time 
period last week with a 79 rating and a 16 share 
a rating point equals 931000 television households a share is 
the percentage of television sets in use in the time period that 
are turned to the show 
the sweeps which come up four times a year are when viewership 
is closely measured so local network affiliates can set advertising 
rates

the vatican has barred a swiss university from 
giving an honorary degree to a roman catholic archbishop because of 
his views on abortion 
archbishop rembert g weakland said friday he was disappointed 
the vaticans congregation of education ordered his removal from a 
list of award recipients without discussing its objections with 
him 
the vatican told the theology department of the university of 
fribourg that granting weakland a doctorate honoraris causa by 
a prestigious faculty of theology would only add to the 
confusion 
this prelate has recently taken certain positions relative to 
the question of abortion which are not without doctrinal importance 
and which are causing confusion among the faithful in the united 
states it said 
it was the vaticans first public reprimand against weakland on 
the abortion isue 
although he has said he respects the churchs opposition to 
abortion he suggests antiabortion demonstrators sometimes lack 
compassion and that prochoice doesnt necessarily mean 
proabortion 
weakland wrote oct 23 to the rev damian byrne head of the 
dominican order in rome saying he was withdrawing from 
consideration for the degree 
faculty members at the university of fribourg protested the 
vaticans decision and voted on oct 24 not to grant any of the 
five honorary doctorates that were to have been presented next 
thursday 
to make a decision like this without consulting archbishop 
weakland indicates that rome still has not learned the importance 
of due process in dealing with individuals whether bishops or 
theologians the rev thomas reese of washington dc said in a 
telephone interview 
i think the results will be counterproductive and will simply 
put rome in a bad light in the united states reese said i 
have no doubt archbishop weakland will now get many more offers of 
honorary degrees

the fiesta bowl will move to san diegos jack 
murphy stadium if the participating teams object to playing in 
arizona the chairman of the selection committee said saturday 
night 
don meyers told the associated press that if the game has to be 
moved because of the reaction over arizona voters rejecting martin 
luther kings birthday as a state holiday it will be played jan 1 
in san diego three days after the holiday bowl in the same 
stadium 
weve struck a deal with jack murphy stadium meyers said 
we feel weve got a shot at topranked notre dame and we 
should know by noon eastern time on sunday meyers said on 
nov 24 the day the ncaa permits official bowl bids we plan to 
extend an invitation to the university of virginia and were not 
aware of any reason for them to turn it down we will also invite 
either notre dame or the highestranked southeastern conference 
team that doesnt go to the sugar bowl 
arizona has been stung by national criticism since tuesday when 
voters rejected by a 5149 margin a referendum which would have 
created a paid state holiday honoring the late martin luther king 
jr 
on wednesday nfl commissioner paul tagliabue said he would 
recommend the 1993 super bowl be moved from the phoenix area 
because of the defeat of the king holiday gov rose mofford 
estimated that losing the super bowl would cost arizona 200 
million in lost revenue 
meyers said 11thranked virginia was extended an invitation to 
the jan 1 fiesta bowl after the team known as the cavaliers beat 
north carolina 2410 saturday an opponent has not been chosen he 
said 
jim copeland virginias athletic director said it was 
uncertain whether the cavaliers would accept the bid 
the fiesta bowl has been an option weve considered all along 
but its been a real difficulty working through that the king 
vote and im not sure weve resolved it yet copeland said

saudi arabia is not allowing 
escaped kuwaiti air force pilots to fly armed training missions 
because of fears they would attack iraqi positions according to 
americans working with the kuwaitis 
more than three months after escaping to the kingdom with most 
of their air force several kuwaiti military men refused to say why 
they were not carrying out armed patrols along with us british 
and saudi pilots 
a saudi ministry of defense spokesman said the kuwaitis were 
here for training and for safety reasons and training flights must 
be unarmed 
the kuwaiti pilots very soon are going to fly on armed 
missions the spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
but american civilian advisers working with the kuwaitis said 
the saudis feared the kuwaitis would head north and bomb the 
iraqis 
the saudis wont allow them to its very obvious if they 
had theyd probably go home said scott corliss 30 of corpus 
christi texas who helps supervise launches of kuwaiti aircraft at 
a base in eastern saudi arabia 
the us air force doesnt use missiles on training flights but 
does arm f15 training flights with canon rounds an air force 
spokesman said 
at the moment the kuwaitis are flying only a4 sky hawk 
groundattack fighters all recently emblazoned with the logo 
free kuwait 
the kuwaiti pilots who arrived here aug 3 a day after iraqi 
troops invaded their emirate said they were anxious to return home 
and ready to die for their country but they also said they would 
never launch a solo attack 
we wont do it because that decision will commit a lot of 
countries said lt col abdulla sultan 40 deputy operations 
officer of the kuwaiti detachment at the base 
we dont want to ignite the war unless its firm everybodys 
ready if we ignite it and everybodys relaxed they might turn 
against us he said 
first lt khaled malallah 27 an a4 pilot said i will not 
do it but we are ready we are ready to go to fight and die for 
our country 
kuwaiti pilots flew 15 mirage f1 fighters 20 a4 sky hawks 6 
hawk trainers and 15 frenchmade gazelle helicopters to saudi 
arabia sultan said 
one helicopter crashed in saudi arabia en route and its twoman 
crew was killed kuwaiti defense minister sheik nawaf alahmed al 
sabah said in early september that the air force lost 8 mirages 3 
a4s and 2 helicopters to iraq 
sultan said about 80 percent of the kuwait air forces planes 
are in saudi arabia and about 95 percent of its pilots 
but after three months he said the mirages are still not 
flying because of serious problems with spare parts he said he 
hoped to get the first mirage up in the air next week 
wade zahnd 35 of stockbridge ga part of the a4 ground 
support crew said about half the 35 to 40 americans working under 
contract for the kuwaiti air force on aug 2 are either in hiding 
or held hostage by iraq 
zahnd said he escaped on aug 13 by driving from kuwait through 
the desert

trains were delayed for several hours before dawn 
sunday as a bomb squad disposed of a suspiciouslooking paper 
bag that turned out to be filled with womens underwear 
the bomb scare came as police were on top alert against 
terrorist activity before emperor akihitos coronation which 
begins monday 
a police spokesman in urawa a tokyo suburb said a railway 
employee spotted the bag beneath a bridge on the takasaki line just 
before 2 am 
the bomb squad soon arrived at the scene froze the bag with 
liquid nitrogen and transported it to a nearby river bank for 
further investigation police found a few dozen pieces of womens 
underwear

have been able to tell that it was harmless but you never know 
the official said speaking on condition of anonymity these are 
tense times 
the investigation led to delays or cancellations of nearly 30 
passenger and freight trains the official said

the onetime reluctance of democrats to 
consider taking on president bush in 1992 has vanished wiped out 
by a faltering economy and sinking presidential approval ratings 
the question asked six months ago was is george bush 
possibly vulnerable said bob beckel a political analyst who 
managed walter mondales 1984 presidential campaign thats now 
switched to theres no question george bush is vulnerable do 
we have a horse to take him on 
my guess is along about december some of the more apparent 
guys are going to start calling folks said john white a former 
democratic party chairman his first choice would be fellow texan 
lloyd bentsen who managed to shine in a losing cause as 1988 vice 
presidential nominee if bentsen doesnt get in white no doubt 
would tilt toward sen sam nunn of georgia 
six months ago it was hard to find a democrat willing to 
acknowledge any interest in a 1992 presidential race but then bush 
saw his public approval ratings plummet as the persian gulf crisis 
dragged on and as concern about the economy heightened amid his 
negotiations with congress over tax increases even republicans 
conceded that bush had damaged himself with his decision to embrace 
higher taxes 
now it looks like the horses are ready to beat down the barn 
door in their eagerness to get onto the track

associates of gov l douglas wilder of virginia have formed 
the committee for fiscal responsibility in 1992 this committee 
is not tied to any candidate said paul goldman the virginia 
democratic party chairman but he went on to acknowledge that it 
could be transformed into a presidential campaign committee 
another item 
aides to gov mario cuomo of new york have called people tied 
to rep richard gephardt of missouri and asked if they thought the 
house majority leader intended to run in 1992 
pregnant quote 
im not going as far as to say im not a candidate sen 
bob kerrey of nebraska 
another pregnant quote 
i intend to be active over the next couple of years in our 
presidential process im not running for anything sen tom 
harkin of iowa 
then there are the more traditional quotes like sen albert 
gore jrs statement that he will sit down and think about it 
the chances for a democrat winning the white house in 1992 
look a lot better gore said during a news conference after last 
weeks elections 
gore nunn gephardt cuomo and sen bill bradley of new jersey 
were on the ballot in 1990 gore nunn and gephardt won easily but 
the voters played nasty tricks with cuomo and bradley 
the new york governor was reelected with just 53 percent of the 
vote against an underfinanced maverick republican who barely 
finished ahead of the conservative party candidate 
housing secretary jack kemp said cuomo was scared witless by 
his narrowerthanexpected margin of victory 
even cuomo conceded we didnt get the margins we wanted we 
didnt get that exultant shout that we wanted from the people 
but cuomo and his aides were quick to point out that he did 
better than republican thomas e dewey who held the previous 
record for the highest winning percentage by a governor seeking a 
third term 
dewey also was a twotime presidential nominee who lost both 
times 
bradley had an even more uncomfortable election night 
an overwhelming favorite to win a third term by a landslide 
against gop political novice christine todd whitman bradley 
squeaked through with 51 percent of the vote 
bradley was nearly tossed out by an electorate enraged by 
democratic gov james florios plans to raise their taxes that 
might tell the whole story but those who want to diminish the 
senators presidential prospects dont want to let it rest there 
bradley was a principal author of the 1986 tax reform bill that 
eliminated most income tax deductions while lowering rates 
a lot of us think his tax plan was really a tax rise said 
white 
pollster peter hart saw little permanent damage to either 
candidate 
i think it probably makes it a little more difficult to go 
fund raising he said but raising money does not seem that much 
of a problem for either cuomo or bradley 
gephardt bradley and gov bill clinton of arkansas took 
themselves out of 1992 to one degree or another but such demurrers 
are hardly binding 
gephardt who carried iowa in 1988 but faltered in subsequent 
primaries wrote a letter to his house colleagues when he ran for 
majority leader and said he would run not for president in 1992 
already the rumors on capitol hill are that his fellow democrats 
who believe he has done an excellent job as majority leader are 
telling him not to feel bound by his letter 
as a general proposition i think nobody ought to throw their 
hat in the ring right now because thats the last thing the voters 
want to see happen said mike mccurry former communications 
director for the democratic national committee voters attention 
is going to right to the persian gulf after the news of the 
buildup 
yet you have start doing the dance you dont have to start 
doing pirouettes just yet but you at least have to start shuffling 
your feet

backers of legal abortions gained strength in 
congress and among governors last week but abortion opponents won 
races too proving they can still defend incumbents and elect new 
allies 
in the end 1990 provided something for everyone in the debate 
over abortion 
abortion rights did not prove to be the political silver bullet 
that some had hoped it would be after the supreme court revived the 
issue last year but few really thought it would 
instead abortion turned out to be an issue that can effectively 
decide some votes not everyones vote but enough to matter in 
close races 
where you have anywhere from 5 to 10 percent of the voters who 
are deciding how they vote on one issue thats dramatic said 
republican political consultant doug bailey it clearly was a 
decisive factor not necessarily the decisive factor in a whole 
lot of races in a whole lot of different ways 
while both sides had victories the issue seemed to have the 
most potency for abortionrights supporters where there were clear 
differences between candidates the candidates made it an issue 
and the races were otherwise competitive 
there is still a political advantage for the prochoice 
side said democratic pollster geoff garin but the results 
were slightly less clear cut this time because the antichoice 
side has learned how to play defense a little bit better 
the election also showed that taxes and the economy can crowd 
out abortion as a political issue 
and it showed that voters are capable of ticket splitting on the 
issue in iowa voters reelected both an antiabortion governor 
and an abortionrights senator in oregon voters rejected 
antiabortion ballot measures while reelecting an antiabortion 
senator 
where abortion was a fundamental issue it cut for the 
prochoice candidate said university of virginia political 
scientist larry sabato but where other issues took precedence 
then prolife candidates were able to win 
on the abortionrights side the premier victories were in 
florida where democrat lawton chiles was elected governor and 
texas where democrat ann richards will be the new governor 
in florida ousted republican gov bob martinez had led an 
unsuccessful effort to enact restrictions on abortions after the 
supreme court gave states new authority in its webster decision 
last year 
richards strongly supported abortion rights but the biggest 
factor was her opponent himself clayton williams who made a 
series of embarrassing remarks including some considered degrading 
to women richards won more than 60 percent of the womens vote 
and 25 percent of republican women crossed over to vote for her 
according to exit polling 
abortionrights supporters also had put a top priority on 
reelecting iowa democrat tom harkin their point man in the us 
senate he won easily 
abortionrights forces also won in minnesota where 
antiabortion incumbents were defeated by republican arne carlson 
for governor and democrat paul wellstone for the senate they won 
the california governors race before the first vote was cast 
both candidates supported abortion rights 
victories for the antiabortion side included the election in 
kansas of democrat joan finney over gop gov mike hayden an 
abortionrights supporter republican george voinovichs election 
as governor in ohio and the reelection of gop sens mark hatfield 
in oregon and jesse helms in north carolina 
also abortion foe wally hickel was elected governor of alaska 
as an independent and pennsylvanias antiabortion democratic gov 
bob casey was easily reelected 
perhaps the biggest victory for abortion opponents was their 
unexpected defeat of michigans democratic gov james blanchard by 
state sen john engler an abortion foe 
abortionrights groups pointed to nevadas approval of a 
proposal to write abortion guarantees into state law as well as 
oregons defeat of two antiabortion ballot measures 
abortion opponents also suffered a defeat in idaho where gov 
cecil andrus vetoed a tough antiabortion bill passed by the 
legislature andrus easily won reelection and the chief architect 
of the bill republican roger madsen was defeated for reelection 
to the state senate as abortion opponents lost control of that 
chamber 
all told the national abortion rights action league counts a 
net gain of four governors for their side they gained two votes in 
the senate wellstone and republican hank brown in colorado who 
replaces retiring gop sen bill armstrong a fierce abortion foe 
in the house abortionrights advocates scored a net gain of 
eight seats according to groups on both sides of the issue 
obviously this means that the house will be more closely 
divided on abortionrelated issues acknowledged douglas johnson 
legislative director of the national right to life committee 
he contended abortion opponents will still be able to sustain 
abortionrelated vetoes in the house 
but in the senate the abortionrights side may now approach the 
60 votes needed to avoid antiabortion filibusters 
abortionrights activists also estimate they gained new 
majorities in at least one legislative chamber in four states 
arizona idaho montana and florida 
in almost all of the key races abortion was one of the top

crowds gathered for remembrance day which commemorates the 
veterans of the two world wars

standing 
i got the impression that he was running towards the 
cenotaph said halewood referring to the national memorial in 
the center of whitehall dedicated to the glorious dead of both 
world wars and other conflicts

desertweary us marines now 
have a place to unwind and relax complete with an olympicsized 
pool a jogging track and a camel named sue whos willing to pose 
for souvenir snapshots 
its an oasis within an oasis said marine lt col gary 
ivan wilson a reserve liaison officer from camp pendleton calif 
who runs the recreation center dubbed club saudi 
the center located in a rear area away from the front lines 
was built for saudi soldiers but has been made available to us 
troops by the saudi government 
it may well be the only place in saudi arabia where you wont 
find a marine carrying his m16 rifle weapons can be checked in 
metal lockers 
but security is tight a reminder that any time marines are 
together they can be targets for terrorists seven years ago in 
lebanon 241 marines died in their sleeping quarters bombed by a 
suicide truck driver 
we remember beirut and will not let that happen here wilson 
said this can be a vulnerable area 
club saudi is a far cry from the desert where troops who need 
exercise can do pushups in the sand or use weights fashioned from 
sandbags 
at the center soldiers can swim and play water polo pump iron 
in a outdoor area for free weights jog on a track play video 
games or have a barbecue they can ride sue the 
camelinresidence or just pose for pictures with her 
it is the first time the marines have really been able to 
relax since coming to saudi arabia they come in tired and worn 
out and by the end of the day you see them beginning to relax 
many of them will fall asleep in the lounge chairs wilson said 
the center will open a second pool in about a month in the 
meantime troops can enjoy daily movies a snack bar and table 
tennis theres a place to tape messages to send back home and red 
cross representatives if anyone needs help with a problem back 
home 
the club with a staff of 60 is open to marines navy and some 
british hospital personnel 
the marines say its a muchneeded break from their desert 
routine 
before it opened confessed one marine who did not want his

kgb renegade oleg kalugin on sunday accused prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov of showing disrepect for the soviet 
judicial system by boycotting the trial of a lawsuit against him 
kalugin is suing ryzhkov for stripping his military rank and kgb 
chairman vladimir kryuchkov for taking away his pension he 
contends the officials took the action as punishment for his 
criticism of the soviet unions powerful intelligence agency and 
secret police 
ryzhkov has not sent a lawyer or other representative to any of 
three hearings on kalugins lawsuit including one held sunday 
i understand when he doesnt respect our countrys public 
the 55yearold former kgb general told the moscow city court 
referring to ryzhkov history will pass judgment on him for that 
but when he doesnt respect the countrys legal organs in which he 
works and which he supposedly rules thats a disgrace which the 
court should evaluate as disrepect to the country 
supporters who packed the courtroom applauded 
kalugin is among the many soviet public figures who have 
demanded ryzhkov resign for failing to reverse the countrys 
economic decline 
kalugins fight with the kgb has made him a popular hero and 
helped him win a seat in the 2250member soviet congress he has 
accused the kgb of resisting reform and continuing to spy on 
citizens opposed to the communist party 
after a halfhour session on sunday focusing largely on 
procedure judge nikolai romanenkov postponed further action on 
kalugins lawsuit against ryzhkov until the supreme court of the 
russian federation considers a protest filed by the soviet 
prosecutors office 
the prosecutor objected to several complaints in kalugins 
lawsuit the judge did not outline the prosecutors objections 
the official soviet news agency tass said the prosecutor 
contended the order to strip kalugin of his rank was taken by a 
collegial body even though it was signed only by ryzhkov the court 
had earlier allowed kalugin to file his lawsuit against ryzhkov 
personally 
the prosecutor also said such an order can be appealed only to 
the supreme court of the country not to the moscow city court to 
where the case was being heard 
kalugins lawyer boris kuzentsov said the protest by the 
prosecutors office showed authorities were panicking when they 
realized the court could consider the actions of the prime 
minister illegal 
kalugin vowed to continue the fight 
lets do it again well do it at every level ill do it with 
pleasure kalugin told reporters in english a language he 
learned while a kgb agent in the united states from 1958 to 1970 
if he wins reinstatement kalugins civil lawsuit against the 
kgb could become a landmark for soviet citizens seeking protection 
for free speech and challenging the secrecy of government 
decisions

president bush decided to nearly double us 
forces in the persian gulf as a signal to iraq and the rest of 
the world that the united states has more than enough firepower 
to force saddam hussein out of kuwait if necessary us officials 
said 
we had to show the international community we were serious 
said one official 
the decision also was prompted by bushs determination to match 
saddams own military buildup the officials said 
the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
bushs decision to send in more troops and equipment was not made 
overnight but evolved over a period of weeks 
the situation has been evaluated and reevaluated as time went 
on said one official 
the administration on thursday announced massive ground sea and 
air reinforcements to the combat power already in the gulf region 
that could mean as many as 200000 new forces will be added to the 
some 230000 us military personnel already there 
in announcing the additions bush on thursday said they were 
needed for an adequate offensive military option words chosen 
carefully as a signal to hussein 
us forces now in place in saudi arabia and on ships in the 
gulf already had a limited offensive capability officials said 
but they said the president wanted to send a forceful new message 
to saddam by emphasizing the word offensive 
bushs decision to bolster us forces was motivated in part 
by saddams own buildup in sending nearly half of his 
millionstrong army to face the united states across the saudi 
border 
saddams dogged refusal to yield to world condemnation or to 
four months of international economic sanctions was also a factor 
in bushs decision to up the stakes 
it wasnt that bush decided at some point that the economic 
sanctions werent having an impact aides said 
weve always placed an emphasis on the sanctions one 
official said but he added we want to maintain our 
credibility 
the sanctions are not changing his saddams mind even 
though they are having an effect on his society the official 
said the degree of seriousness with which saddam takes 
international efforts is questionable 
even though bush still intends to give economic sanctions a 
chance to work there is no evidence that the sanctions are having 
their desired effect on saddam officials said 
the united states also is caught between conflicting pressures 
being urged by britain saudi arabia and turkey to put more 
emphasis on military action and by the soviet union to exercise 
restraint 
the soviets are the lynch pin of the coalition one official 
said 
soviet leaders have acknowledged that force could not be ruled 
out but said they prefer to give diplomacy more time before 
pulling the trigger 
however secretary of state james a baker iii noted that the 
international consensus against iraq was solid and unified as 
he ended a sevennation diplomatic mission to shore up support for 
potential military action in the gulf last week 
sending new reinforcements into the region but announcing that 
they would take up to two months to get there was bushs way of 
trying to accommodate both sides 
it gives the sanctions more time to work but also increases the 
pressure sharply on iraq 
a week before he announced the troop increases bush was sabre 
rattling as he stumped for republican midtermelection candidates 
reminding saddam that he was not ruling out a military action and 
even comparing the iraqi leader to adolf hitler 
but bush waited until after the elections to announce the 
decision to send in more troops he would really have been 
accused of taking political advantage if he had announced this a 
week ago said one white house aide 
bush was to meet with congressional leaders involved with 
foreign policy on wednesday to review the latest developments

the chief of police has bad news for anyone 
thinking the acquittal in the mapplethorpe obscenity trial means 
the city will soften its stand against sexually explicit magazines 
movies music and art 
what do you want me to tell you that there wont be another 
mapplethorpe case theres no way i can say that chief lawrence 
whalen said last week in his annual meeting with the 
homosexualrights group stonewall cincinnati 
free speech advocates were elated oct 5 when a jury cleared the 
contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie of 
obscenity charges for showing robert mapplethorpes sexually 
graphic photographs but 350000 in legal bills nearly crippled 
the art gallery 
a week after the trial hamilton county sheriff simon leis 
threatened to file charges against a theater showing the film 
henry and june the steamy account of the love triangle 
involving writers anais nin and henry miller and millers wife 
june is rated nc17 no one under 17 may attend 
county investigators did not watch the film said frank weikel 
a spokesman for leis no charges were filed 
on oct 24 two men were taken to court for holding hands in a 
parked car a judge dismissed the charge disorderly conduct for 
creating a physically offensive condition saying it was too 
vague 
a cincinnati promoter who staged an indianapolis concert by 2 
live crew after a florida jury cleared the rap group of obscenity 
charges says he wont risk a show in his home city 
whalen and spokesmen for leis and county prosecutor arthur ney 
say the outcome of the mapplethorpe case which cost the city 
14550 hasnt changed their outlook on cases involving sexually 
explicit material the late photographers work includes photos 
with homosexual themes and nude studies of children 
the sheriff has said repeatedly as long as obscenity statutes 
are on the books he will enforce them said spokesman frank 
weikel you dont change your attitude in enforcing murder 
statutes if one murderer gets off 
richard buchanan a lawyer and a member of stonewall cincinnati 
isnt surprised 
they dont care that they never win because if they make it 
costly enough for you to defend your rights that in itself has a 
chilling effect buchanan said 
at his meeting with about 75 members of stonewall cincinnati 
whalen bristled at suggestions that the mapplethorpe case was a 
waste of tax money he also denied that it was part of a pattern of 
harassing homosexuals 
whalen declined to discuss the case against the two men who were 
holding hands citing the possibility of a lawsuit against the 
city but he stressed that the contemporary arts center was 
indicted by a county grand jury drawn from the community at large 
how do you know that the grand jury did not include members of 
the gay community whalen said 
the case against the contemporary arts center produced public 
displays of opposition from residents who chafed at efforts to 
maintain the cleancut image of this city that closed all adult 
bookstores and movie theaters in the 1970s 
when henry and june opened oct 12 a week after the 
contemporary arts centers trial ended about 300 people attended a 
weekday afternoon showing many said they knew nothing about henry 
miller but were there just to anger leis 
steve liberatore who arranged 2 live crews concert oct 24 in 
indianapolis laughed at the prospect of a cincinnati performance 
im not sure we would have been interested in bringing it into 
cincinnati in view of the problems the city has had with rap 
groups he said 
a judge fined two members of the rap group nwa and another 
performer 100 each for disorderly conduct last year after they 
invited a concert audience to join them in a sex act 
record stores stopped selling 2 live crews album as nasty as 
they wanna be in april after leis said he might file obscenity 
charges a florida record store owner was convicted oct 3 of 
obscenity charges for selling the record 
tom thompson manager of globe records downtown said the 
verdict in the mapplethorpe case was encouraging but he still has 
no plans to sell more copies of as nasty as they wanna be 
it just isnt worth the headache why should i sell it and 
jeopardize us thompson said

law enforcement authorities estimate that soviets 
have 36 million illegal guns in their hands leaving the 
increasingly restive population armed to the teeth a newspaper 
reported sunday 
the article in komsomolskaya pravda was the latest in a series 
of reports about rising lawlessness in the country and appeared 
less than a week after a gunman opened fire in red square while 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other leaders were reviewing 
revolution day festivities 
four months ago gorbachev ordered illegal firearms to be turned 
in but the newspaper reported widespread disobedience of the 
decree with the interior ministry saying that individuals 
surrendered only 20100 guns 700000 rounds of ammunition and 3 
tons of explosives 
of the 36 million illegal firearms in circulation 25000 are 
rifles the interior ministry said 
the article was a followup to a report in komsomolskaya pravda 
last week in which the newspaper offered to buy firearms from black 
marketeers while keeping their names confidential 
since the communist youth league newspaper began its offer in 
late october it reported it has been offered whole arsenals of 
various types of modern weapons including heavy machine guns 
hand grenades grenade launchers portable antitank launchers and 
a railway car full of weapons 
our impression is the country is armed to the teeth 
correspondent d muratov wrote 
the newspaper said it had turned its investigation over to 
gorbachev who has deemed it very important and forwarded it 
to defense minister dmitri yazov interior minister vadim bakatin 
and other officials 
weapons are stolen not only from arsenals but also from 
armament factories assembled or in pieces the newspaper reported 
in addition weapons that are deemed obsolete or irreparable are 
intercepted by black marketeers before they can be destroyed it 
said 
in a separate report sunday the communist party newspaper 
pravda said police captured three servicemen who had deserted from 
an interior ministry unit in omsk with three submachine guns five 
revolvers and a large amount of ammunition that may have been 
headed for the black market 
gorbachevs order on surrendering illegal weapons appeared to be 
aimed at armed volunteers in such ethnic trouble spots as armenia 
and azerbaijan where nearly 500 people have been killed and 
weapons such as automatic rifles and rocketpropelled grenades are 
common 
during last months election campaign in georgia politician gia 
chanturia was wounded by gunmen who fired four shots from a 
speeding car 
in the most visible sign of the increasing gun culture two 
shots were fired on red square about 80 yards from gorbachev during 
wednesdays holiday celebrating the 73rd anniversary of the 
bolshevik revolution soviet newspapers and tv showed plainclothes 
officers subduing a man identified as alexander a shmonov 38 of 
leningrad who was charged with attempting a terrorist act and 
reportedly undergoing psychiatric treatment 
guns also are increasingly being used in ordinary crimes as the 
soviet economy deteriorates 
nationwide there were more than 5000 crimes committed with the 
use of firearms this year a 4 percent increase over 1989 the 
newspaper said that includes a 20 percent increase in the number 
of murders although the newspaper did not report how many people 
had been killed 
a situation is quite possible in which people in our endless 
lines start shooting at each other komsomolskaya pravda said 
last week 
the newspaper urged the government to encourage people to 
surrender their guns by offering them cash rewards in the 
meantime it recommended tighter security at arsenals 
vasil bykov a member of the soviet parliament wrote in an 
accompanying article in komsomolskaya pravda that the militarys 
continued production of arms which exceeds manufacturing levels in 
the united states is leading to national selfdestruction 
he described the glut of firearms as an uncontrollable 
elemental force that will destroy us at the hands of our starving 
compatriots

two burmese students who hijacked a thai 
jetliner will not be extradited as officials consider their request 
for political asylum news reports and officials said sunday 
prosecutors meanwhile filed charges against the two men and an 
official said they would be given special treatment while in 
custody 
the students commandeered the thai airways airbus 300 on 
saturday with a phony bomb made from soap and wires they said they 
wanted to draw attention to the militarys refusal to relinquish 
power in burma to an elected civilian government 
united news of india quoted unidentified sources as saying the 
government has decided not to hand over the students to burmese 
authorities 
a foreign ministry official said the government was considering 
their request for political asylum even though it has not been made 
formally he did not say what constituted a formal request 
we do not have any extradition treaty with burma so we are not 
under any obligation to send these boys back said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the plane was hijacked shortly before it was due to land in 
rangoon burma on a flight from bangkok thailand and was 
diverted to calcutta about 650 miles northwest of the burmese 
capital 
all 203 passengers left calcutta aboard a special thai airways 
plane sunday the foreign ministry official said the government 
impounded the plane 
sixteen crewmen stayed behind for questioning and are not 
expected to leave before monday airport police inspector sunil 
mandal said 
chief secretary manish gupta the top civil administrator of the 
state that includes calcutta said the two students were charged 
before a local magistrate with criminal conspiracy 
he said the hijackers who identified themselves as ye marn 24 
and ye htink yaw 22 will be given what is commonly known as vip 
treatment usually reserved for political figures 
jailed politicians in india often get better jail conditions 
such as cushioned beds and good food 
the two hijackers spent the night in a government guest house 
where they were interrogated most of sunday mandal said 
a third burmese student was supposed to participate in the 
hijacking but the trio ran low on money in bangkok and could only 
afford two plane tickets the hijackers said they spoke at a news 
conference after surrendering shortly after midnight saturday 
the two students said they were unarmed and never had any 
intention of hurting anyone the fake bomb was made out of bars of 
soap with protruding wires 
we wanted to draw international attention and international 
support for our human rights and democracy campaign marn said 
our mission has been fulfilled 
he said they hijacked the plane to india because of its 
democratic tradition and any country which loves democracy 
should support our cause 
marn and htink yaw said they were students at rangoon 
university they wore red headbands emblazoned with a fighting 
peacock which they said was the symbol of prodemocracy student 
groups in burma 
burmas military government crushed a studentled prodemocracy 
movement two years ago and continues to detain large numbers of 
people for political reasons 
the national league for democracy won a landslide victory in an 
election last may but the military regime refused to step aside 
and intensified the suppression of dissidents 
freed passengers said the bluejeanclad youths were not 
menacing 
these young men did not misbehave with us said hiromu 
tsuchiguchi 42 a travel agent from osaka japan 
there was a bloke walking up and down the aisle with something 
in his hand and that was the only bitof tension said david 
irwin 30 of london 
but after hours of sitting on the tarmac it became boring 
tedious once we landed it was a nonevent really irwin said 
there was a little tension at the beginning said john 
cogan 46 a lawyer from houston the hijackers moved women and 
children to the front and the men to the back of the plane when 
people moved the hijacker would threaten to push the button on 
the fake bomb 
but he repeated several times that he meant no harm cogan 
said

lita belga had not heard from her 
husband for months when she learned he died in a car accident in 
saudi arabia she wept millions of other filipinos wept too 
mrs belga received news of her husband benjamins death during 
a telephone call to his saudi employers paid for and broadcast by 
private radio station dzrh 
the program called around the world with love features 
telephone conversations between filipinos and their relatives 
working abroad the calls are free on condition that they can be 
used on the show 
the highly popular broadcast has become a reallife soap opera 
a daily litany of money troubles loneliness death and other 
family crises 
the beauty of the program is the spontaneity of it said 
program host rey langit it is truetolife drama unfolding right 
before you it is both entertaining and educational 
there is no shortage of people wanting to use the program to 
contact relatives overseas even though the price is having 
personal conversations broadcast nationwide 
you have not been sending money gloria abalos said in a 
recent call to her husband ernesto in saudi arabia i will kill 
myself thats what ill do i dont care how long you stay 
there as long as you send us money 
the conversations are often painful with millions listening 
relatives tried to muster the courage to tell boy santos that his 
4yearold daughter had died while he was in saudi arabia 
no one would admit outright the child was dead but santos 
figured out what they were trying to say 
what have you done to my baby he cried you killed her 
most callers are too poor to afford overseas telephone calls 
every morning they come to dzrhs studios to sign up all but 
emergency cases wind up on a waiting list with a backlog that now 
runs about two months 
langit says the station makes little profit from the program 
because calls are expensive he places an average of six calls 
daily during the sixdayaweek twohour program 
the program is both a commitment and moral obligation to give 
good advice and help the poor with their problems he said in an 
interview they come to us pleading and telling us that we are 
their only hope 
mrs belga turned to the station after a filipino who had 
returned from saudi arabia told her that her husband was dead 
neither his employers nor the government had notified her 
may i talk to my husband please she asked the person who 
answered the telephone in riyadh the reply was in arabic 
eventually another filipino came to the telephone and confirmed 
the death 
langit said he reminds callers beforehand that they will be on 
the air still many conversations are wrenchingly candid 
in one call a jealous husband in saudi arabia argued with his 
wife until langit passed the telephone to their young daughter 
why are you angry at mother the girl asked mother now 
has to wash clothes for other people just to feed us she weeps day 
and night 
langit then scolded the husband about his family 
responsibilities 
the success of that call was that i was able to instruct the 
guy to say i love you to his wife before he hung up langit 
boasted 
not all conversations end painfully 
once a 14yearold girl asked the station to help find her 
father who had abandoned her and moved to the united states 
we really wanted to help her but how can we when the only 
clue she had of his whereabouts was that he worked at a restaurant 
in new york with huge glass panes in front langit said 
using a manhattan hotel directory the station began calling 
restaurants at random amazingly they found the father working as 
a bartender 
you dont know me but im the child you abandoned said the 
girl with a nationwide audience listening in you never sent us 
money and that is the reason why i have to sell flowers in the 
street and miss school 
in a quavering voice the father replied it is my fault my 
daughter but you must understand that if i did not remarry here i 
would not have survived 
the girl now lives in the united states with her father langit 
said 
cecilia abogado called her sister anita in saudi arabia who 
complained that her employers beat her 
im here at dzrh she said do you remember we used to 
listen to other peoples problems on the air now they are 
listening to ours

president elias hrawi is moving to 
bankrupt militia factions as part of a strategy to end the nations 
15yearold civil war 
the main objective of the syrianbacked government is to regain 
control of 12 mediterranean ports used for years by christian and 
moslem forces to siphon off customs duties import weapons and ship 
goods and possibly drugs 
without money to pay their fighters theyll gradually 
disintegrate moving into their areas shouldnt be a major military 
challenge under those circumstances a government source said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
but the 41000 fighters in the estimated dozen militias are not 
likely to quietly relinquish the ports along lebanons 137mile 
coastline 
some main militias have begun withdrawing from the beirut area 
to create a demilitarized zone under a plan by hrawi and the arab 
league 
so far only nabih berris prosyrian shiite moslem amal has 
said it will disband other forces have made no such commitment or 
operate beyond the control of hrawis government or the syrians 
which have about 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab league 
mandate 
among the groups likely to complicate the peace efforts are more 
than 5000 guerrillas in south lebanon backed by the palestine 
liberation organization the 2000 iranian revolutionary guards in 
east lebanon and the fundamentalist proiranian shiites of 
hezbollah or party of god 
hrawi would face a tough challenge if an allince emerged 
between the lebanese militias and the nonlebanese factions a 
government official said 
with money and weapons the warlords wont give in easily 
he explained arafat wont simply order his fighters to leave 
lebanon and iran wont be that happy to lose its influence here 
either 
there are frequent reminders of lebanons volatility the oct 
21 assassination of christian leader dany chamoun and most of his 
family a car bombing wednesday in christian east beirut that 
killed six people and israeli raids in south lebanon on friday 
the government hopes that once beirut has been demilitarized 
the army and syrian troops can concentrate on gaining control of 
other areas including the ports 
sources estimate the militias take 100 million a year in port 
customs duties and other taxes money badly needed by the 
financially strapped government 
the militias also use the ports to bring in weapons and other 
goods they sell on the market they also ship produce from the 
areas they control sources said the militias have reportedly used 
the ports to traffic drugs 
once theyve abandoned their strongholds in beirut and lost 
their ports militia leaders would be caught between a hammer and 
a hard rock a government source said 
theyd have no influence in decisionmaking and theyd be 
without money he explained 
but berri and druse moslem leader walid jumblatt have built up 
financial empires amid the chaos of the civil war which has killed 
an estimated 150000 people 
among their commercial enterprises are jumblatts cogeco co 
based in the drusecontrolled port of jiye south of beirut and 
berris taka energy co that imports fuel 
the government plans to compete on the open market for fuel and 
seek to undercut the militiacontrolled companies 
berri faces a particular problem because his company may lose 
the stateowned zahrani oil refinery near the southern port of 
sidon which it has used to store imported fuel 
the marada or giants militia fielded by the prosyrian 
christian franjieh clan in north lebanon also would lose a major 
source of revenue if hrawi takes control of the port of chekka 
where the militia has been collecting illegal taxes on cement 
imports since 1976 
hrawis forces also will cut the taxes militias levy on goods 
entering or leaving their areas 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
hrawis army led by gen emile lahoud has only about 9000 combat 
troops to police greater beirut and the three main highways from 
the capital

boot camp for the first kuwaiti 
volunteers would astound an american drill sergeant cheating at 
pushups weekends off and no weapons in sight 
this isnt going to make us great soldiers but at least we 
can go fight said ahmad aldhafeeri 21 who dropped out of 
marshall university in huntington wva to volunteer for the 
kuwaiti army whose remnants are now in saudi arabia 
about 600 kuwaitis in the onemonth training program say they 
want to be in the first wave to liberate their homeland even if it 
means death 
we are not soldiers believe me we are not fighters we are 
not politicians i think we are lovers looking and trying to find 
a place to live aldhafeeri said 
while some of the 230000 american gis deployed in the persian 
gulf region are still sleeping under the desert stars most kuwaiti 
tents have rugs on the floor and ice chests 
about a dozen bangladeshi cooks were preparing roast chicken for 
the kuwaitis sunday lunch while the americans were partaking of 
cold prepackaged rations 
reveille is at 6 am long after most us marines are out 
doing morning exercises every day the kuwaitis have a postlunch 
siesta until 330 pm 
more than 100 cars were in the parking lot many luxurious 
models with cellular phones for weekend and possible evening 
escapes 
still its tough getting into the military routine for some 
one volunteer who gave his last name as alodwany said all the 
volunteers are losing weight 
with daytime temperatures down to the mid90s the volunteers 
are training more he said but psychologically we are tired 
col sedy faleh alshammey the kuwaiti commander said the main 
aim of the intensive training which was compressed from six 
months was to teach the volunteers to use machine guns 
only 10 day from graduation however the men had still not seen 
a gun 
we want it now said alodwani 30 who had been studying for 
a masters degree in economics at california state university in 
fresno he was in kuwait visiting his family when the iraqis 
invaded on aug 2 
we are all anxious to get some machine guns and get inside 
kuwait he said 
alshammey assured reporters that no volunteer would graduate 
without knowing how to fire a machine gun and invited them back to 
watch target practice 
the volunteers training started with physical fitness and 
companysized units were doubletiming through camp out of step 
chanting god our country the emir 
maj qubil alrawshidi 42 a burly kuwaiti army veteran led 
one company through handtohand combat showing them how to 
karatechop the necks and pluck out the eyes of an enemy there was 
more enthusiasm than finesse among the volunteers 
when it came to pushups however many volunteers grunted and 
only managed to get their shoulders off the ground at one point 
the major held his leg under a volunteers body so he couldnt 
cheat 
alshammey said 7000 kuwaitis had volunteered for military 
service in saudi arabia and at kuwaiti embassies abroad 
the kuwaiti army set up a training center here which opened with 
the current class of 600 another center in the united arab 
emirates graduated its first class on saturday he said 
the uae armed forces headquarters announced in abu dhabi on 
sunday that it will continue training more kuwaitis 
no decision has been made yet on whether the volunteers here 
will be held as a reserve or go on active duty with the 5000 
kuwaiti troops who escaped and are now massed near the 
saudikuwaiti border alshammey said 
the volunteers aged 21 to 35 want to join their countrymen on 
the front line 
the iraqis have great missiles and they are well trained 
aldhafeeri said but we are going to win because we are fighting 
for a goal and they are fighting like animals we are fighting to 
free our mothers and fathers our families and our country

indias new prime minister faces some 
awesome challenges ahead ranging from religious and class strife 
to a looming economic crunch in his vast and divided country 
chandra shekhar has never held executive office his inner 
circle lacks governing experience and he is heading the weakest 
government in indias 43year history as an independent nation 
he was installed saturday three days after his breakaway 
faction of the governing janata dal party helped bring down the 
11month reign of vp singh 
the changeover comes as india tries to recover from hindumoslem 
rioting separatist movements are tugging at its border states and 
inflation is driving millions beyond poverty into hunger with each 
climbing percentage point 
chandra shekhars government is inherently unstable his newly 
formed janata dal socialist party controls just 61 seats in the 
decisionmaking lower house of parliament 
it is propped up by the 195 seats of the congress party led by 
former prime minister rajiv gandhi who was chandra shekhars sworn 
enemy until they joined forces to unseat singh 
cynics say gandhi will dump the new prime minister as soon as he 
believes he can win an election this government will last as 
long as congress wants it to singh said 
chandra shekhars immediate task is to grapple with the 
religious and social conflicts that have claimed more than 500 
lives in two months and which ultimately undid the singh 
government 
hindu fundamentalism has swept across india promoted by 
mantrachanting politicians preaching that hinduism equals 
nationalism and urging hindus to stand up for majority rights 
hindus make up 82 percent of indias 880 million people 
riots erupted at the end of last month over a plan by hindus to 
overrun a moslem mosque in the pilgrimage town of ayodhya and 
replace it with a temple in two weeks more than 370 people were 
reported stabbed shot or bludgeoned to death and hundreds more 
deaths may have gone unreported 
the hindumoslem turbulence diverted attention from protests by 
uppercaste hindus over singhs policy to reserve nearly half of 
government jobs for lowcaste hindus about 150 people mostly 
teenagers died in clashes with police or in dramatic suicide 
protests 
the fires of caste and religion were stoked by politicians 
bidding for votes among the enormous voting pool of indias 
downtrodden masses where chandra shekhar also has traditionally 
found his support 
separatist insurrections in border areas have escalated in the 
last year lives are lost with such numbing regularity that daily 
newspapers pay scant attention 
in punjab militants are seeking an independent state for sikhs 
who claim that the hindus dominating the federal government are 
stealing their water and wealth from their northern farming state 
the separatist movement among one of indias traditionally most 
loyal minorities has divided families and villages at least 2700 
people have been killed by sikh extremists this year making 1990 
their deadliest year since the insurrection began in 1983 
moslems in jammu and kashmir the only state where they are in a 
majority also want to break away the casualty toll there has 
surpassed 1500 since indian forces cracked down this year 
india says both insurrections are being fed by arms and training 
from across the border in pakistan the nation which constitutes 
chandra shekhars biggest foreign policy challenge pakistan denies 
aiding the separatists 
in the far eastern state of assam the united liberation front 
of asom has set up a virtual parallel state dominating the 
countryside and extorting vast sums from managers of the rich tea 
plantations 
in the northwest part of assam bodo tribesmen are fighting 
another terrorist campaign for autonomy 
in the far south 100000 tamil refugees have swamped indias 
shores in flight from the guerrilla war in sri lanka across a 
narrow strait 
in the long run chandra shekhars government will stand or fall 
on the economy the one issue which unites this diverse nation 
which is home to one of every six humans on earth 
inflation officially is running at a projected rate of 10 
percent but recent surveys show that in rural areas the daily 
food basket has shot up by 25 percent since july 
about half the population more than 400 million people fall 
below the poverty line or hover just above it many families 
compensate for higher prices by cutting down on meals

the government unveiled plans sunday for 
an innovatively designed museum that some hope could pave the way 
for the return of a great greek treasure the elgin marbles long 
in british hands 
an international jury picked a design by italian architects 
lucio passarelli and manfredi nicoletti for a new museum to house 
the sculptures from the temples of the acropolis 
the design which beat out 438 other entries calls for a 
lowslung hall that would be big enough to house the parthenon 
the ruins of which will be visible from inside 
sculptures will be displayed suspended in space in the 
positions they occupied in the actual temple which was built in 
the 5th century bc visitors will be able to walk up several 
levels moving up to and around the suspended sculpture as if 
passing through the walls of the temple 
the sculpture depicts a procession in honor of the godess 
athena a battle between men and centaurs the birth of athena and 
her contest with the god poseidon over who would give his name to 
the city 
the building site is at the foot of the acropolis hill in 
central athens and the parthenon will be visible through a 
semicircular eye set in the sloping ceiling of the 
40000squareyard building 
culture minister tzannis tzannetakis who announced the result 
of the competition said he did not know when construction will 
begin 
we will press ahead to complete it as soon as possible and try 
to have it done by 1996 he told a news conference 
he said it was still too soon to know what the cost would be 
but that he would put it very vaguely between 80 million and 
100 million 
tzannetakis said the government will try to raise the money from 
the european community of which greece is a member and private 
donors 
our country faces serious economic problems he said but 
the protection of our cultural heritage is our obligation not only 
to history and our ancestors but toward europe of which we are an 
inseparable part 
the idea of a new museum was first raised in 1976 and the 
international competition was announced in may 1989 
plans for the museum revived hopes that some of the finest 
marble sculpture from the acropolis could eventually be returned to 
greece the treasures were removed in the early 19th century by 
lord elgin a british diplomat 
the works known as the elgin marbles are housed in the british 
museum the british government has always rejected greek appeals to 
return them 
but two british members of the 14member international committee 
that chose the winning museum design said the new structure could 
justify the return of the priceless sculpture 
my work on this jury was to see that a welldesigned museum 
was chosen in which one could say that the marbles will be well 
cared for said sir bernard feilden an architect i think we 
achieved something so i hope the marbles will be returned 
the point is it seems to be a very good museum to house the 
marbles said jules lubbock an architecture professor and art 
historian 
apart from those in the british museum sculptures from the 
temples on the acropolis have been housed in a small museum on the 
hill and in the athens archaeological museum 
many statues and reliefs that survived earthquakes fire 
plunder and bombardment have been replaced by copies to protect 
them from the air pollution of modern athens 
the temples themselves are currently undergoing extensive 
restoration work to protect them from the atmosphere and to repair 
damage caused by earlier restoration work iron rods used in the 
19th century to connect blocks of marble have corroded the columns 
they were intended to support 
the restoration work is to be completed in 1995 
the architects will receive an 80000 award for their design

pope john paul ii on sunday visited an 
infamous prison known as he living hell where he prayed with 
aids victims and urged drug traffickers to go straight 
john paul told 300 inmates in the prison chapel that faith could 
help them escape an underworld of drugtrafficking violence and 
the mafia the theme has marked the popes fiveday visit to the 
naples region his longest pastoral journey in italy 
my dear friends i have come to invite you to have patience 
to seek goodness and mutual understanding the pontiff told the 
inmates most of them in their 20s clad in jeans 
think about your families sorely tried by your condition 
think about those who love you and count on you carry a little 
serenity within you even in this place and among yourselves 
the 71yearold poggioreale prison is the most notorious in 
crimeridden naples because of overcrowding and poor conditions 
built for 1000 prisoners it housed 2700 until recently when 
several hundred were transferred to a new prison 
many prisoners are detained on drug charges and 600 are drug 
addicts according to the prison among poggioreales most famous 
inmates was raffaele cutolo a convicted murderer and boss of the 
camorra the neapolitan mafia that controls an international 
network of cocaine trafficking 
on sunday the pope saw little of the drudgery that has earned 
the prison the nickname the living hell among neapolitans a 
fresh coat of creamcolored paint covered the prison walls and the 
bright white chapel was spotless 
but a young prisoner in a short speech told the pope the 
inmates lived in sad conditions 
above all when we return to our families we want to find a 
society ready to receive us and to make us feel once again that we 
are men and useful citizens of the community just like everyone 
else the prisoner cried to the cheers of inmates 
several waved small yellowandwhite vatican flags or olive 
branches symbolizing peace as the pope left the streethardened 
toughs bent to kiss his ring they beamed as he warmly greeted 
them 
i feel so full of emotion one young inmate told a reporter 
before a security guard reimposed himself in front of the 
prisoners 
after the ceremony the pope walked to the ward reserved for 
about 50 aids victims he shook the mens hands and tenderly 
stroked their hair then prayed briefly with them 
crime drugs and unemployment have been important themes of the 
popes trip to naples which began friday the city has remained a 
symbol of urban blight and mafia power in a nation emerging as a 
european economic powerhouse 
on saturday john paul visited the citys worst slum urging 
residents to not give in to evil he also criticized local 
politicians for cronyism and appealed for a recuperation of 
legality 
the popes trip to poggioreale occurred the day after the 
national government enacted measures to limit early releases from 
prison 
an embarrassed justice minister giuliano vassalli said during 
the papal ceremony that the measures do not in the least affect 
the laws and acts aimed at making prison life more humane and 
dignified

his eyes teared his nose ran and his 
lungs burned but spec 4 eric hackman could do little but endure 
te discomfort caused by tear gas wafting through an army gas 
chamber 
hackman 24 of latrobe pa and other fort eustis soldiers got 
a good whiff of the gas as part of their training in the use of 
masks and clothing designed to protect them from chemical weapons 
the soldiers had been through the training before they knew how 
to suit up and clear their masks by breathing out hard but events 
in the persian gulf were making the refresher course particularly 
timely 
in the event he goes to saudi arabia and if he doesnt do the 
procedure properly does not clean the mask properly he could be 
exposed to the chemical get sick die said maj frank connor 
chief of the training division at fort eustis 
about 230000 us troops have been sent to the persian gulf 
since iraqi president saddam hussein sent his army into neighboring 
kuwait on aug 2 saddam has stockpiles of chemical weapons and has 
used them against the kurds in eastern iraq 
us soldiers train regularly in putting on their protective 
gear and performing their jobs if you are a truck driver you 
have to be able to do your truck driving in an nbc environment 
said sgt 1st class larry price head of the posts nbc 
nuclear biological chemical branch 
hackman and others volunteered to remove their masks inside the 
chamber a tent set up in a forest clearing some commanders 
require it as part of the training others do not 
the exercise is intended so you will be confident in the 
mask when you go into the battlefield said staff sgt marvin 
ward 
the smell of the gas seeped from the tent and the wind blew it 
on those waiting their turn 
lets get it over with one soldier said 
about 10 masked soldiers filed into the chamber when they left 
10 minutes later with their masks off they were bent over 
coughing and waving their hands 
dont touch your face cautioned sgt donna niemuth in 
charge of the chamber look into the wind 
hackmans eyes were redder than most 
you want to rub your eyes said hackman of the 155th 
transportation company based at fort eustis right before i got 
out the door i got a good breath 
spec 4 richard hill also of the 155th wasnt as bothered by a 
runny nose 
i blew it good before i went in there hill said it 
burns i want to scratch my eyes theres a real nasty taste in my 
mouth 
the tear gas wore off in about 15 minutes 
the soldiers also spend time in the classroom learning about 
chemical agents much stronger than tear gas 
price taught a recent class to members of the army reserves 
359th transportation battalion based in nearby hampton 
price told them there are four nbc tenets avoidance protection 
and decontamination and pulling all three together to perform in a 
contaminated environment 
chemical warfare agents include nerve gas blister agents like 
mustard agent and blood agents that strip oxygen from the blood 
they can be fatal or incapacitating price said the effects of 
some agents wear off quickly others can last many years 
nerve agents cause loss of muscle control and affect nerve 
endings price said 
how many of you took black flag and sprayed it on a bug he 
asked thats what nerve agent does to you

donna lambert an unemployed factory worker made 
out well in the massachusetts throwthebumsout election 
running a 600 campaign she beat the incumbent for a 
56000ayear job as the middlesex county register of probate 
i am a very nice person who loves people and i am not a 
politician said lambert 56 a republican im a grandmother 
thats been elected to an office 
lamberts democratic opponent tom larkin was appointed to the 
post by gov michael s dukakis in 1989 after his predecessor was 
made a judge he was surprised by the election results which gave 
lambert a lead of more than 40000 votes 
she won fair and square the numbers are clear larkin said 
lambert has been collecting 144 a week in unemployment since 
she was laid off from her job with a baby clothes manufacturing 
company last june that job paid 19000 a year her husband works 
as an electrical engineer for polaroid corp 
the register of probates term is six years in middlesex county 
which includes diverse urban and ruralsuburban areas around 
boston lambert said she may use the extra money from her new job 
to install a swimming pool at home 
lambert graduated from high school in newton and then did what 
she called handson training raising four children she had a 
real estate brokers license at one point but it has expired 
i think shes in a state of shock she didnt expect to win 
said larkin 
the register of probate oversees 100 employees and processes 
more than 12000 new cases a year including divorces child 
support cases and wills there are eight judges who work fulltime 
for the court larkin said 
larkin has two masters degrees one in psychology and another 
in public administration from harvard university he also has 10 
years of experience as a county commissioner as well as experience 
as the director of special education for the boston school system 
larkin blamed his loss in part on the fact that lamberts name 
came first on the ballot he also said the antiincumbent 
sentiment which propelled a republican governor into the 
statehouse to replace democrat dukakis fueled a vote for the 
republican challenger 
its one way to get off unemployment but shes going to have 
a lot to learn he said 
lambert said she has long been involved with the republican 
party as a member of the republican town committee and said she 
has done work at election polls while working at the polls she 
noticed republicans never fielded candidates for county jobs 
so i said thats it ill look and see and im going to 
run she said 
larkin spent about 25000 on the primary campaign and 5000 
to run against lambert his strategy included some television ads 
bumper stickers and a series of lawyers breakfasts 
lamberts campaign cost 600 and consisted largely of a 
letterwriting effort she had green and beige business cards made 
up and mailed them to about 200 people picked at random from voter 
registration lists and the telephone book

colonialstyle buildings still line the 
business district in this town on albemarle sound that once was 
north carolinas colonial capital the picturesque small town 
retains a quaint charm 
but edenton also is the site of the states biggest and most 
complicated childabuse case 
prosecutors allege that over the course of a year at the little 
rascals day care center 29 children were sexually assaulted by the 
owners employees and a friend of the owner all seven deny the 
charges 
with more than 400 counts the case exceeds that of the mcmartin 
preschool trial in california in which the defendants were 
acquitted earlier this year one of those defendants raymond 
buckey was tried a second time but the prosecution ended with a 
deadlocked jury in july and the charges were dropped 
the mcmartin case consumed seven years of court time ad cost 
los angeles county more than 135 million making it the longest 
most expensive criminal court case in us history 
many of edentons 5800 residents are uneasy discussing the case 
here many have close friends on both sides and district attorney 
hp williams has asked residents not to spread unfounded 
statements about the case 
im getting tired of hearing about it said steve an 
attendant at a service station who wouldnt give his last name i 
wish theyd just get going and get it over with a lot of people 
feel that way 
the case broke when someone lodged a complaint in january 1989 
alleging abuse of children at the center the state child day care 
section in raleigh revoked the centers license in march 1989 and 
one of the centers owners bob kelly was arrested shortly after 
prosecutors allege that children between the ages of 2 and 7 
were raped sodomized and assaulted the indictments allege that 
most of the assaults occurred between september 1988 and january 
1989 
the defendants are little rascals coowners kelly 41 and his 
wife elizabeth twiddy kelly 34 willard scott privott 40 
darlene mcdonald harris 25 and three former employees of the 
center shelley alyce stone 34 kathryn dawn wilson 24 and 
robin boles byrum 19 all but two remain in jail in lieu of bond 
all seven could face multiple life sentences if convicted 
the case hit a snag in october when the judge handling the case 
cited its complexities and withdrew after the state supreme 
court overturned his ruling that the defendants should be tried 
separately 
a new judge was selected 
i would say we may not be at square one but were certainly 
at square two said joe cheshire a lawyer representing mrs 
kelly referring to the new judge 
the new judge is still looking over the case cheshire said 
sunday he is reviewing the file and i assume we are waiting for 
a court date at which we will discuss where we stand he said no 
decision had been made on whether the defendants would stand trial 
together or in small groups 
bill hart a lawyer from the state attorney generals office 
assigned to help prosecute the case said that the earliest it 
could go to trial would be january 
were hoping the trial will only take six to eight weeks 
hart said of course you never can guarantee about the length of 
a trial 
cheshire said that in his opinion a january trial ishighly 
unlikely seeking as how its almost thanksgiving 
a civil suit filed against mrs kelly provides a glimpse into 
what kind of case the prosecution could present 
we anticipate that some of the children will testify some of 
parents will testify and counselors will testify said c everett 
thompson ii a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the negligence 
suit the suit has been put on hold at the request of prosecutors 
some of the children are still troubled thompson said 
theyre going through therapy theyre getting treatment he 
said we think it will be a long time before we really know the 
extent of the damage and the scarring that occurred to these 
children

vietnam has offered to allow the united 
states to use a former us naval base if washington lifts a 
26yearold trade embargo the official vietnam news agency 
reported sunday 
the offer by communist party chief nguyen van linh also applies 
to japan which follows the boycott said the agency monitored in 
bangkok 
the agency report was based on an interview given by linh to 
japans nhk television company 
the former us base at cam ranh bay about 175 miles northeast 
of ho chi hinh city formerly saigon has been a soviet military 
site since the vietnam war ended in 1975 
the soviet union has said it maintains no more than a token 
presence at cam ranh bay and intends to withdraw completely 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach has said the 
withdrawal would be completed by 1992 
the trade embargo was imposed on communist north vietnam in 1964 
and was extended to the entire country following the fall of the 
usbacked saigon government in 1975 
washington has had no diplomatic relations with vietnam since 
the war ended secretary of state james a baker iii and thach met 
in october 
linh said he hope relations with japan would improve if ties 
with washington were normalized 
i know that japan wants to cooperate and do business with 
vietnam but it is tied to the us policy of embargo i believe 
japan will be more resolved to do business with vietnam he said 
linh also told the japanese network that vietnam would permit 
us and japanese investment around the country the agency 
reported 
if you want to do business you may invest not only in cam 
ranh but in other ports as well linh was quoted as saying 
in the news agency report linh appeared to confirm reports that 
he took part in a threemember delegation that visited beijing in 
september 
the reported meeting with chinese premier li peng would have

a simple blood test conducted before pregnancy 
might be a new way of identifying women at high risk of 
miscarrying according to research published in a british medical 
journal 
writing in the nov 10 edition of the lancet the researchers 
said it was the first time that measuring hormone levels before a 
woman conceives has been found to predict whether a pregnancy will 
be successfully carried to term 
the doctors tested for the luteinising hormone lh which 
controls ovulation 
dr lesley regan dr elisabeth owen and professor howard jacobs 
tested 193 women planning to become pregnant the women ranged in 
age from 21 to 43 with a median age of 307 
the obstetricians from the rosie maternity hospital cambridge 
and university college medical school wrote that 88 percent of the 
women with normal lh levels conceived within 18 months only 67 
percent of the women with abnormally high lh levels conceived 
within that period 
in the normal lh group 12 percent of the women suffered 
miscarriages in the high group 65 percent miscarried 
the doctors concluded that a raised serum lh concentration in 
the early phase of pregnancy confers a substantial risk of 
miscarriage the finding offers the possibility of a simple 
predictive test for women before pregnancy 
an abnormal result could also be used to identify patients that 
could be treated to suppress excessive secretion of lh

two top police officials were replaced in a 
shakeup stemming from last months temple mount killings officials 
said sunday 
the cabinet meanwhile discussed a compromise move to allay 
international criticism of israel over the oct 8 temple mount 
shootings in which 20 arabs were killed by police gunfire 
also sunday authorities announced 2400 more palestinians would 
be banned from entering israel for security reasons and an israeli 
soldier was shot and wounded in the west bank 
in the police shakeup jerusalem police chief aryeh bibi and 
rachamim comfort commander of the southern police district which 
includes jerusalem were reassigned 
both were strongly criticized in a government report on the 
temple mount killings the report compiled by a threemember 
investigating team condoned the use of live fire on stone throwers 
and said palestinians started the riot but criticized police for 
failing to anticipate the violence 
in the wake of the report police minister roni milo decided to 
create a new police district in jerusalem chaim albaldes 
currently head of the central police district will become 
commander of the new district thus removing bibi 
comfort was replaced by rafi peled currently chief of the 
national police intelligence department 
the report had criticized both comfort and bibi for bad judgment 
and mistaken assessment of intelligence data in the temple mount 
incident 
israel radio reported that comfort and peled will work together 
for several months and then comfort would retire early 
bibis name was not included in the list of new appointments 
the radio said he was expected to be moved to another post which 
would not entail a promotion in rank 
jerusalem was swept by a wave of jewisharab street clashes 
following the temple mount shootings in recent weeks police 
strength in jerusalem reached 2000 officers about oneeighth of 
the police force for the entire country 
in the cabinet discussion of international criticism over the 
temple mount shootings ministers suggested sunday they would be 
willing to welcome a un envoy if the visit was not directly 
tied to a security council resolution condemning irael 
foreign minister david levy told army radio that a compromise 
was being discussed both at the united nations and with us 
officials in washington 
he acknowledged the government was trying to head off another 
security council resolution that could call for specific steps 
against israel and was hoping to persuade washington to veto such 
a move 
all our efforts are aimed at preventing a negative decision 
regarding israel and we are acting in every way possible including 
the strengthening of our understanding with the united states 
levy said 
the decision to ban more palestinians from entering israel 
brings to 10800 the number of arabs from the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip who are blocked from visiting or working in israel 
the decision was announced by shmuel goren the coordinator for 
the occupied territories he said on israel radio that the program 
would cover palestinians from security and criminal categories 
those who the police and security elements believe constitute a 
security risk 
military government spokesman shmuel ozenboy said the move would 
take effect this week but he would not be more specific 
about 110000 residents of the territories captured by israel in 
the 1967 middle east war work in israel palestinians have 
complained new limits on workers could hurt the territories 
economy since few jobs are available outside israel 
the soldier who was wounded sunday was shot near bet el a 
jewish settlement in the west bank about 10 miles north of 
jerusalem the army command said it said assailants in a car fired 
at him as he was waiting at a bus stop and the soldier fired back 
the army said 
the soldier suffered arm and leg wounds but they were not 
serious the army added

last weeks contemporary art sales confirmed 
that the steam has gone out of the art market according to art 
experts and more disappointing prices could emerge this week in 
sales of works from the estates of henry ford ii and greta garbo 
the euphoria that once gripped auction rooms is gone amid fears 
of a us recession 
but if the market has fallen its far from dead experts say 
speculators who didnt know pissarro from picasso may have departed 
but serious collectors who know art and buy for the long term are 
bidding 
what we are missing are the headlinegrabbing situations that 
we had in the last couple of years said william e oreilly of 
salanderoreilly galleries inc now i think we have a more 
conservative buying public whereas perhaps there was more of a 
festival mood about it before 
sothebys auction of postwar art tuesday was certainly no 
festival 
fewer than half of the works offered 34 out of 77 were sold 
the rest failing to reach the minimum price the sellers had in 
mind and the total for the sale was 198 million only half of 
the lowest presale estimate by the auction house 
christies sale the following night was a bit more upbeat 
thirty of the 58 lots sold for a total of 367 million against a 
presale estimate by the auction house of 477 million to 654 
million 
willem de koonings july a large abstract canvas of 
fractured shapes and obscured colors painted in 1956 sold for 88 
million well above its highend estimate of 7 million 
the very top market usually sustains itself said bonnie 
barrett stretch editor of the artnewsletter a biweekly report on 
the international art market true masterpieces sustain prices 
through thick and thin 
that may not bode well for this weeks sale of impressionist 
paintings since art experts agree that few outstanding works are up 
for sale if sales are sluggish they say it will have more to do 
with the quality of the art offered than the state of the market 
stretch says the absence of great art works has to do with luck 
of the draw and a reluctance among some owners to sell in the 
current market 
the art collection of the late henry ford ii will be auctioned 
on monday at sothebys the most important work is renoirs cup 
of chocolate an oil on canvas painted about 1878 of a young 
woman seated with a cup and saucer at her side 
the presale estimate for the painting is 15 million to 18 
million 
on thursday the art collection of film legend greta garbo will 
go on the block at sothebys 
sothebys is counting on people buying because of the garbo 
name said harry brooks director of wildenstein co inc a new 
york art gallery 
but there are really only three important renoirs and a 
bonnard he said if that sale doesnt do well that doesnt 
mean anything because the whole sale is sort of overblown 
christies will sell a still life by vincent van gogh on 
wednesday vase with daisies and poppies painted in the french 
town of auvers shortly before his death in 1890 has a presale 
estimate of 12 million to 16 million 
none of these prices approaches the staggering records set 
during the spring auction sales when van goghs portrait of dr 
gachet brought 825 million at christies and renoirs at the 
moulin de la galette fetched 781 million at sothebys 
the total estimate for the art to be auctioned at the two houses 
during the two weeks of major fall sales is 508 million to 665 
million the may series of sales brought 9257 million 
allan stone a new york dealer says the auction rooms had 
become theaters of the absurd in recent years not only did 
great art realize recordbreaking prices but lesser art fetched 
higher prices than good art in galleries 
the new years eve party is over people are doing their 
homework he said the auction houses will have to weed out the 
material that comes in and offer just the best quality stuff

chancellor helmut kohl promised to visit soviet 
troops in eastern germany after soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev expressed concern over reported problems facing the 
soldiers a government spokesman said sunday 
gorbachev on saturday ended a twoday trip to germany during 
which he signed a 20year treaty of nonaggression friendship and 
cooperation 
but he returned to moscow without receiving any commitment for 
economic aid beyond the 195 billion already promised by the 
german government and banks 
most of the aid is to pay for withdrawing the troops and for 
housing and retraining in the soviet union 
on friday gorbachev mentioned in a speech his concern over an 
antisoviet flavor in german public attitudes toward the 
380000 red army soldiers remaining in former east germany 
a government spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed a report in the conservative welt am sonntag newspaper 
that kohl promised he would visit soviet military camps in the 
coming year and speak with the troops the soviet military forces 
are scheduled to withdraw over the next four years and there are 
reports of poor morale extortion desertions and violence among 
the soldiers already 
the two germanys united on oct 3 and the nation became a nato 
member 
the german magazine stern in its most recent edition said 
older soldiers were beating up younger ones to force them to hand 
over their pay it also said the number of suicides among the 
troops was high 
soviet troops lead closely restricted lives in the german bases 
but there are german news reports that some have deserted to live 
in the forests and others are stealing weapons and military 
hardware to sell on the black market

hundreds of volunteers joined 
national guard and army corps of engineer troops sunday in a battle 
to save mount vrnons downtown from the rainswollen skagit river 
we are in a full flood fight said dave brookings skagit 
county assistant flood control engineer 
but elsewhere many of the more than 500 residents displaced by 
nearrecord flood levels on seven northwest washington rivers were 
returning home and most dikes and levees held in lowlying areas 
three houses were lost in an isolated resort town and officials 
said damage to roads bridges and homes and businesses from 
flooding friday and saturday would run to millions of dollars 
high water slides and washouts closed numerous roads and 
highways including the trans canada highway north of hope british 
columbia about 90 miles east of vancouver 
no injuries were reported 
the threeday deluge was produced by the pineapple express 
what national weather service forecasters call a fall storm route 
from hawaii to the pacific northwest 
in mount vernon with a population of about 14500 brookings 
said 400 to 500 people filled sandbags as the skagit river crested 
at 352 feet 72 feet over flood stage 
three to four feet of sandbags were piled atop a 34foot 
revetment protecting the downtown area brookings said 
this is all just flat farmland he said after it gets 
over the levees that water just keeps spreading 
downstream where the skagit divides before emptying into skagit 
bay about 60 people were evacuated late saturday from fir island 
and 50 or so left conway brookings said 
dozens of people filled sandbags to shore up shaky dikes near 
conway to try to prevent the displacement of an additional 500 to 
600 people he said 
it looks like weve got it under control he said 
he said approximately 150 people forced from their homes in 
three areas near concrete about 30 miles east of mount vernon and 
60 miles north of seattle would begin returning home sunday 
the skagit would have risen about 3 feet higher at mount vernon

puget sound power amp light co hydroelectric dams said larry merkle 
of the army corps of engineers reservoir control center in seattle 
in whatcom county the most hardhit by flooding friday and 
saturday damage could approach 10 million said bill quehrn of 
the county department of emergency services 
about 200 people were evacuated from sumas on the canadian 
border and dozens more from everson but most were returning sunday 
as the water subsided quehrn said 
the towns that were flooded yesterday are drying out he 
said its down to puddles in the street 
about 100 people in and around the lummi indian reservation 
north of bellingham were displaced after dikes failed along the 
lower nooksack river 
a plugged storm drain led to the evacuation of 15 to 20 people 
from a dozen homes about 16 miles south of bellingham quehrn said 
the resulting twoacre pond as deep as 25 feet was undermining 
a scenic highway and draining toward the homes which range from 
expensive yearround residences to summer and vacation cottages

at glacier 40 miles east of bellingham three homes in the 
glacier springs subdivision tumbled 40 to 50 feet into canyon 
creek which eroded the bank

ebey island home to about 300 to 400 people in the snohomish river 
east of everett 
a few miles upstream two hours of sandbagging by about 40 
people averted major flooding at snohomish said al amonson staff

a little bit of everything will be for sale 
when the mustang ranch brothel falls under an auctioneers gavel 
tuesday from household items to gaudy relics of americas 
bestknown sporting house 
we highly encourage the neighborhood yard sale enthusiast to 
come out and make a bid on anything they may want said internal 
revenue service manager dierdre pagni 
ms pagni conceded that despite her agencys familiarity with 
such sales its hard to predict what the turnout will be for the 
bankruptcy auction 
weve never done this with the mustang ranch before she 
said 
the event is expected to draw curiosity seekers as well as 
serious bidders irs agents padlocked the 104room bordello on 
sept 21 three days after the property owned by joe and sally 
conforte was forced into bankruptcy liquidation 
the governments intent is to recoup a portion of the 13 
million in back taxes it says is owed by the confortes the auction 
has been advertised in newspapers around the country including the 
wall street journal 
the irs hopes to get at least 18 million largely from the 
sale of the ranchs real estate holdings 
two buildings which make up the ranch compound will be sold 
separately as will a 60unit trailer park in nearby lockwood and 
the 440 acres surrounding the brothel 10 miles east of reno just 
off interstate 80 
so far the brothel has piqued interest as a potential nursing 
home a halfway house and a home for wayward girls even a 
religious group has inquired about the property although the irs 
has remained mum on details 
while tuesdays auction will cover many of the types of items 
found at a typical garage sale there are others that definitely 
are not 
amid the lamps couches and bottles of booze are large paintings 
of nude women a painting of conforte boxes of condoms and framed 
posters pointing out the locations of nevadas legal bordellos 
there even is a picture of heavyweight boxer oscar bonavena who 
was gunned down at the gates of the mustang in 1976 by conforte 
bodyguard willard ross brymer 
the confortes started the mustang ranch illegally at first in 
the 1950s in 1960 local authorities proclaimed it a public 
nuisance and burned it to the ground 
but a decade later conforte won approval from storey county to 
operate the brothel paving the way for legalized prostitution in 
most rural nevada counties 
county commissioners last month revoked the permit allowing 
prostitution at the mustang ranch saying they would never again 
endure the circus atmosphere that has surrounded it the past 35 
years

a shadowy trade in armaments abandoned by 
the united states at the end of the vietnam war will be illuminated 
in a trial scheduled to begin this week in federal court 
cenon rey avelino a canadian citizen of filipino origin is 
accused of trying to smuggle two cessna a37 dragonfly jets from 
vietnam into the united states after selling the jets to undercover 
us customs agents for 306000 
the light attack planes dismantled and crated were seized a 
year ago by customs agents at buffalos international peace bridge 
avelino was later indicted on charges ranging from moneylaundering 
to violating the trading with the enemy act 
his trial begins tuesday before us district judge john t 
elfvin and is expected to last about three weeks avelino who has 
been held without bail since his arrest could face more than 10 
years in prison if convicted on all charges 
avelino 40 of suburban toronto is portrayed in court papers 
as a globetrotting arms dealer who boasted he could obtain a 
variety of military hardware abandoned by the united states in 
vietnam 
the pentagon has estimated that nearly 1000 military planes 
including 113 dragonflys were abandoned in vietnam when the united 
states pulled out in 1975 also abandoned were 940 naval ships and 
boats 42000 trucks 791000 m16 rifles and a large amount of 
other assorted weaponry 
avelino told the agents he represented the government of vietnam 
and could get 18 million worth of arms from that country 
according to statements filed in court by us customs and royal 
canadian mounted police officers 
federal officials have said they are concerned that vietnam may 
be selling abandoned us arms to third world countries unfriendly 
to the united states 
at a pretrial hearing last winter the customs agent in charge 
of the case cw moore said agents had considered trying to get 
avelino to work for them so the us government could acquire more 
of the abandoned arms and keep them from falling into the hands 
of madmen 
that idea was scuttled when the customs service and the defense 
department refused to pay for the scheme moore said 
us attorney dennis c vacco has said the undercover agents who 
dealt with avelino in toronto and jacksonville fla portrayed 
american businessmen he refused to say what reasons the agents 
gave for wanting the jets 
james harrington avelinos lawyer has said his client is a 
legitimate businessman who never concealed his ties to the 
government of vietnam 
the jets had been sitting idle for 15 years and were in no shape 
for combat harrington said he said avelino understood the agents 
wanted them for parts 
the a37 according to air force manuals can carry various 
combinations of rockets and bombs under its wings the planes also 
could be equipped with 762mm machine guns 
a37s which could fly more than 500 mph and higher than 40000 
feet originally cost us taxpayers more than 1 million apiece 
when they were built in the 1950s and 60s 
avelino told customs agents at the border that his cargo 
included dismantled jets but he misrepresented the type of 
aircraft and declared their value to be only 36000 authorities

nasa on sunday prepared for the 
launch of the space shuttle atlantis which is to carry a spy 
satellite into orbit after being grounded for months by fuel leaks 
the countdown was to begin at 1030 pm est 
atlantis is scheduled to lift off thursday sometime between 630 
pm and 1030 pm est the precise time will not be announced 
until nine minutes before launch because of the classified nature 
of the military mission 
atlantis five astronauts will deploy the satellite which 
published reports say will spy on iraq it is believed to be a 
photographic imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft 
the mission originally was planned for july but was put on hold 
when atlantis was found in june to have hydrogen leaks columbia 
also was crippled by hydrogen leaks and nasa temporarily grounded 
the entire threeshuttle fleet 
nasa replaced atlantis external fuel tank hydrogen lines 
between the orbiter and tank and valve seals a fueling test last 
month found the shuttle to be free of dangerous leaks 
during the interim the air force is reported to have modified 
the satellite so it could spy on iraq 
atlantis has not flown since march when it conducted another 
secret pentagon mission its upcoming trip will be the 37th shuttle 
flight and the seventh mission dedicated entirely to the defense 
department 
the flight is expected to last four days a public blackout will 
be imposed throughout the mission and no information will be 
released 
nasa plans to launch columbia about two weeks after atlantis 
mission if all goes well columbia has been waiting for the 
astronomy mission since may when hydrogen leaks halted the first 
of four failed countdowns

local humane society officials are 
pressing for an ordinance to ban all breeding of dogs and cats 
its not that they are against puppies and kittens they just want 
to stop killing 10000 unwanted animals each year 
the debate over the proposed breeding ban is shaping into a 
class battle fought by responsible pet owners and breeders of 
aristocratic pets and shelter workers who must euthanize thousands 
of those pets poorer cousins each year 
what is radical is what weve been doing killing animals 
said kim sturla executive director of the peninsula humane 
society i think its crazy that its become acceptable to kill 
dogs and cats 
under the proposal believed to be the first of its kind in the 
nation pet owners found in violation would face fines ranging from 
100 to 500 penalties would be waived if the animals are spayed 
or neutered 
it doesnt seem right if people allow their animals to roam 
outside then i understand why they should be spayed or neutered 
said carolyn varner of san mateo county who is selling two 
5monthold registered persian kittens for 175 each 
but my cats are indoor cats and they arent allowed to go 
breed every time they go into heat 
the proposed ordinance which would apply to unincorporated 
areas in this affluent county of 600000 south of san francisco is 
designed to reach zero pet population growth 
it calls for a oneyear moratorium on breeding and then 
mandatory spaying and neutering of cats and dogs pet stores would 
still be allowed to import puppies and kittens but the animals 
would have to be neutered 
opponents argue that it is unenforceable breeders they say 
would lose a livelihood and animals spayed and neutered to comply 
with the new law would be barred from many competitions 
san mateo county supervisor tom nolan the ordinances sponsor 
said he expects some details may be modified after public hearings 
that begin tuesday before the county board of supervisors 
but nolan says the tragedy of euthanizing thousands of animals a 
year ultimately outweighs other concerns 
if you put show and prize animals as one value next to an 
ordinance that might potentially save 10000 dogs or cats a year i 
imagine the choice is clear nolan said 
sturla said there are no largescale breeders she is aware of in 
san mateo county 
i would challenge anybody to show me anyone making a living 
off breeding animals except puppy millers sturla said 
were certainly having an impact on somebodys hobby but were 
not having an impact on anyones livelihood 
and nolan said he is less interested in catching every violator 
than encouraging pet owners to be responsible 
my hope is that there will some kind of social sanctions 
attached to the person in the neighborhood who lets their dog or 
cat go around without being spayed or neutered he said 
of the roughly 15000 animals brought to the shelter each year 
1500 are returned to their owners and 3500 are adopted according 
to humane society figures the remaining 10000 animals are killed 
as if the statistics werent attentiongrabbing enough the 
humane society recently euthanized several animals in front of 
reporters 
were trying to illustrate to the public that 10000 is not 
just a statistic sturla said they are living feeling 
animals 
the reporters experienced what we experience every single day 
they got to see fear on the animals face to see the animal 
tremble and see her defecate in the hallway on the way to the 
kennel sturla said 
what were attempting to do is drag the euthanization of dogs 
and cats out of the closet nolan said when you see it you 
understand its a barbaric practice

at the vietnam memorial bob horsch of rahway nj a veteran 
of army service in vietnam said he believed it was just a matter 
of time until the united states was at war again

was justified by the need to protect american interests and those 
of other countries 
stephen reuben of lapwai idaho a member of the nez perce tribe 
who also served in vietnam declined to say whether the buildup was 
a good idea but also said he fears the country was headed for war 
i am afraid so but i pray and hope we dont reuben said

buildup said we have to protect our interests as to whether 
it would mean war she said i certainly hope not mrs swain

cheney paid tribute to the american troops now serving in the gulf 
region 
at arlington national cemetery cheney laid a wreath at the tomb 
of the unknowns and addressed a capacity crowd in the adjoining

those who have been deployed to the persian gulf and saudi 
arabia are probably the best trained soldiers we have ever had 
he said the nation and the world will be better for their 
service 
people who are concerned about peace must stay prepared for 
war cheney said 
the ceremonies held on traditional veterans day in advance of 
mondays official national holiday took place under bright sunny 
skies with a crisp wind whipping through the flagdraped

inscribed on the ebonycolored granite wall they are the names of 
american servicemen killed in vietnam 
col robert f foley an army medal of honor winner from 
vietnam told the crowd the situation in saudi arabia is a grim 
reminder that war is not a thing of the past 
the national park service estimated the crowd at 5000 
jan c scruggs president of the vietnam veterans memorial fund 
his voice breaking spoke of the troops in the middle east saying 
we are very very proud of them and we do hope that in the event 
there is combat they will not get the treatment that the vietnam 
veterans got 
meanwhile the vietnam womens memorial project announced the 
selection of two finalists in its competition for a design of the 
memorial to be built alongside the vietnam veterans memorial the 
target date for its dedication is 1992

east islip long island is a statue of a woman standing by herself 
with a helmet in her hand the other by landscape architect robert 
desmond of arlington mass consists of a white marble block in 
contrast to the black marble of the wall surrounded by 240 jets of 
water 
diane carlson evans director of the project said the two 
finalists would be asked to refine their proposals and the final 
design would be a collaboration of the two 
raquel ramati a new york urban designer who served on the 
nineperson jury of designers and veterans said the panel was 
split the veterans favored a representational sculpture and the 
designers leaned toward an abstract design

john silber the onleave president of boston 
university acknowledges his fiery temper may have cost him the 
governors chair 
silber who was the democratic nominee lost tuesday to 
republican william weld by about 76000 votes out of more than 2 
million cast 
silber in an article for the boston sunday globe said he might 
have been hurt by outbursts which drew attention throughout the 
race 
these faults hardly add up to a temperament unfit to govern 
but perhaps they cost me 50000 votes he wrote if they did 
then perhaps i did blow the election although i am not sure 
silber concluded he was probably the victim of his own testiness 
and an antiincumbent antidemocrat mood that swept massachusetts 
on election day 
it is tempting to excuse ones performance and also wonder 
whether one could have won by doing a little better he said 
or to put it more bluntly to take comfort in thinking that 
you have just been run over by the locomotive of history or to 
experience the disquieting thought that youve blown an election 
that you could have won in my case i can see evidence for both 
diagnoses silber said 
silber acknowledged his vitriolic exchanges with television 
newswomen natalie jacobson and lesley stahl also hurt his campaign 
in an interview with jacobson silber said he believed the high 
number of working mothers led to a generation of abused and 
neglected children 
he also refused to respond when she asked him to name his 
strengths and weaknesses 
silber spread the blame saying he was the victim of 
soundbite journalism and a democratic party out of step with 
voters 
when i began the campaign for the governorship i said that 
although i could do the job i didnt need it i still believe 
that and so do my family he wrote 
silber a texas native said his outspoken style would better 
serve a texas politician but was easily misinterpreted in 
massachusetts 
late in the campaign silber referred to weld as an 
orangeheaded wasp and a backstabbing son of a bitch 
silber apologized for the sob remark 
in the genteel atmosphere of new england these were used to 
divert attention from more important issues silber said

about the crosses a spokesman said 
pilgrims led into the small darkened room off the alphonsos 
bedroom report seeing the images of two crosses one gold one 
white both about 10 inches high on the surface of a small 
translucent window 
visitors point out that there are no lights in the alphonsos 
back yard that might cause the patterns some doubted that a white 
street light and a yellow porch light about a halfblock away could 
be the cause 
sure i could see those street lights ms rodriquez said 
but i dont see how they could have caused the crosses those 
crosses are absolutely gorgeous 
neighbors said mrs alphonso told them that she had just 
finished saying a novena a nineday series of prayers to st jude 
last week when she went to the bathroom to get something from the 
medicine cabinet as she reached for the door she saw the crosses 
reflected in the cabinet mirror

macedonians voted sunday in the first 
free parliamentary elections in more than 50 years in yugoslavias 
poorest republic 
the elections are viewed as a crucial test for yugoslavian 
premier ante markovic a pragmatic economic reformer trying to hold 
this fractious country together markovics new alliance of 
reformist forces is contesting an election for the first time 
opinion polls have shown the alliance about even with the 
reconstituted communist party an albanian nationalist party and 
macedonian nationalists also are vying in the elections for a 
120seat singlechamber legislature 
a good showing in macedonia would boost the alliances chances 
in elections schedled for the coming weeks in the republics of 
bosniahercegovina montenegro and serbia 
the national news agency tanjug reported the overall turnout 
from the approximately 137 million eligible macedonian voters was 
50 percent by 4 pm polls closed at 7 pm 
television said the results were slow coming in from isolated 
villages in the mountainous republic located at yugoslavias 
southernmost tip and bordered by albania greece and bulgaria 
no results were expected until late monday election officials 
said runoff votes will be held nov 25 for seats that produce no 
outright winner 
it was the first multiparty vote here since 1938 
the communists now called the party of democratic change 
support markovics reform programs and have left open the 
possibility of forming a coalition with his alliance 
the alliance of reformist forces was not formed in time to 
contest last springs first multiparty elections in the northern 
republics of slovenia and croatia centerright parties ousted the 
ruling communists in those republics and now are pushing for 
yugoslavia to be reconstituted as a looser confederacy 
the alliance offers the only chance to keep yugoslavia 
together in the long run and to turn it into a modern prosperous 
democracy said rode marinovski a skopje lawyer as he waited to 
vote 
im convinced we will do very well here said stojan andov 
leader of markovics party in macedonia after casting his vote in 
skopje the state capital about 275 miles south of belgrade 
markovics personal popularity grew rapidly after he became 
premier in march and helped control inflation but his freemarket 
economic reforms have pitted him against the hardline communist 
leadership of the countrys largest republic serbia 
croatian and slovenian leaders also are wary of markovics 
efforts to keep the nation more tightly unified as a federation 
from 40000 to 50000 ethnic albanians working as guest workers 
in western europe were reported to have returned to macedonia to 
vote and the albanian party of democratic prosperity was expected 
to do well 
ethnic albanians account for over 20 percent of macedonias 22 
million population 
two other nationalist parties are taking part the macedonian 
action party and the radical internal macedonian revolutionary 
organization which was established 100 years ago to fight turkish 
control of macedonia 
the radical nationalists claim macedonia was unjustly divided in 
1913 among serbia bulgaria and greece they want to form a 
greater macedonia that would include regions of greece and 
bulgaria

military force to free a soviet submarine that ran aground in 
swedish waters nine years ago a soviet officer said in an article 
published sunday 
vasily besedin then the political officer aboard the submarine 
said soviet warships were waiting in international waters off the 
swedish coast 
they were assigned to force their way through and bring home 
the submarine if attempts were made to seize it besedin was 
quoted as saying in the article 
the soviet submarine ran aground near a major swedish naval base 
in the karlskrona archipelago on oct 27 1981 sweden waited seven 
days before returning the vessel 
stuck on a rock for all to see the whiskey class u137 submarine 
became known as whiskey on the rocks the incident soured 
relations between sweden and its powerful neighbor for years

stockholm was an account told to soviet military journalist 
vladimir verbitsky 
swedish navy captain karl andersson told the national news 
agency tt that the soviet forces in the area would not have had 
enough strength to take back the submarine andersson was one of 
the officers who interrogated the soviet crew

have been too high he said

u137 made a navigational error according to besedin navigation 
standards were low aboard and the crew had no idea of where it was 
when the vessel ran aground

iraq said sunday it would attend a proposed 
arab summit if the agenda includes the palestinian question and if 
it is consulted on the time and place 
the iraqi offer came in response to an appeal by moroccos king 
hassan ii who said such a meeting would be a new and last 
chance for a peaceful solution 
iraqs ruling revolutionary command council led by president 
saddam hussein went into emergency session to discuss the matter 
an official statement read on state television said 
it said iraq was willing to attend the summit if it were 
consulted in advance on the timing and location and agenda and if 
the topics included the palestinian question 
in a separate interview broadcast in london on sunday saddam 
repeated his call for an international dialogue on the crisis and 
said he did not think the world was united against him 
he acknowledged that the major powers and a number of 
countries were lined up against iraq but to say that the world 
is unified against iraq is indeed not a correct thing to say 
this is not just our impression he said in the saturday 
interview with britains independent television news in the 
statements of the us and britain they themselves are voicing 
their concern that the unity socalled unity against iraq is 
perhaps suffering from a split 
asked if iraq was ready to leave kuwait saddam saidwe are 
ready to enter into deep dialogue as to the requirements for 
security in our region 
if all parties concerned sat around one table we are 
confident that these parties will reach serious and deep solutions 
to all the issues in the forefront of which will be the 
palestinian issue 
in its statement about the possible arab summit saddams 
government also suggested it would not allow certain topics to be 
discussed at the gathering if it takes place 
the proposed summit should not be part of efforts to prepare 
the political theater as a cover for american aggression against 
iraq and the arab nation the iraqi statement said 
unlike an aug 10 summit in egypt where 12 of 21 arab league 
members voted to send troops to saudi arabia any new summit must 
not be a cover for bringing in us invasion forces the iraqi 
statement said 
the summit should be preceded by serious consultations among 
the principal parties concerned with the subject and with all arabs 
in general it said 
in calling for the summit the moroccan monarch said if there 
were war in the persian gulf region it would penetrate every 
household from the gulf to the atlantic 
let us gather together and see what decisions we can take 
to give to all what they deserve so that kuwait returns to what it 
used to be and that iraq is a satisfied and satisfying member at 
the heart of our arab family the king said 
morocco has been outspoken among arab nations in its criticism 
of iraqs invasion of kuwait it has sent 1200 soldiers to saudi 
arabia and 500 troops to the united arab emirates as part of the 
multinational military buildup against iraq 
hassan suggested meeting in a week in the moroccan capital of 
rabat but the iraqi response appeared to reject this in favor of a

chinas foreign minister arrived in baghdad on sunday carrying 
bad news for saddam hussein china will not block the un security 
council from authorizing the use of force to drive iraq out of 
kuwait a chinese diplomat said 
such a measure has been drafted by the united states diplomats 
and us officials said last week but had not yet been circulated 
among the other permanent members of the security council 
iraq had reportedly pinned its veto hopes on china 
meanwhile iraq said sunday it would attend a proposed arab 
summit meeting if it was consulted on the agenda timing and 
location and if the agenda included the arabisraeli conflict 
the proposed summit should not be part of efforts to prepare 
the political theater as a cover for american aggression against 
iraq and the arab nation said an iraqi statement read on state 
television 
the offer came in response to an appeal by moroccos king hassan 
ii who urged an extraordinary arab summit on the gulf crisis he 
said such a meeting would be a new and last chance for a 
peaceful solution 
in a separate interview broadcast sunday in london saddam said 
he did not think the world was united against him 
the major powers and a number of countries are against iraq 
but to say that the world is unified against iraq is indeed not a 
correct thing to say saddam said on independent television news 
which interviewed him saturday night in baghdad 
this is not just our impression he added in the 
statements of the us and britain they themselves are voicing 
their concern that the unity socalled unity against iraq is 
perhaps suffering from a split 
the us and britain pushed the un security council into 
adopting hastily taken resolutions against iraq and once 
countries began to realize or gauge things in accordance with the 
historical background they began to change their attitudes he 
said 
some recent reports have said the us government differs with 
some allies among them china france and the soviet union on a 
timetable for any military action to oust saddam from kuwait 
the baghdad government also denounced food hoarders and 
announced the price of rice would increase although it did not 
specify how much iraq has weathered three months of economic 
sanctions aimed at breaking its grip on kuwait which it overran 
aug 2 
before the embargo iraq imported about 70 percent of its food 
in september it began rationing essential foodstuffs such as rice 
wheat milk sugar and cooking oil 
the iraqi move to punish hoarders of grain came at a toplevel 
meeting attended by saddam the official iraqi news agency said it 
said the punishment would be strict but gave no details 
the chinese foreign minister qian qichen arrived in baghdad 
for talks with saddam before leaving jordan qian said china 
differed with the united states on the use of force and would 
pursue diplomacy as long as there was a glimmer of hope that 
conflict could be avoided 
but a chinese diplomat in the iraqi capital speaking on 
condition of anonymity said qian would tell saddam that while 
china would not support a resolution authorizing force it would 
not veto it either 
china has veto power along with the other four permanent 
members of the security council the united states britain 
france and the soviet union iraqi officials had said saddams 
hopes for a veto rested with china 
qian was speaking first with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
and was to meet with saddam later sunday 
vice president dan quayle flew to tokyo for the enthronement of 
emperor akihito and was expected to hold talks on the gulf crisis 
with a dozen world leaders while there during the flight from 
washington on sunday quayle conferred with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar who traveled to tokyo with him 
a few more foreign hostages were freed sunday eight italian men 
arrived in amman jordan but hundreds of other italians and other 
foreigners remain captive in iraq 
the italians arrived aboard the same plane that carried david 
lange the former new zealand prime minister who went to baghdad 
to try to win the release of his compatriots he said 16 new 
zealanders were still in iraq but that he hoped for good news 
about them 
some western governments including that of the united states 
have criticized private hostagefreeing efforts by former leaders 
like lange saying the emissaries are manipulated by saddam 
lange asked about that retorted the us has this 
remarkable affinity for misjudging the political climate of the 
moment 
britain meanwhile said it was expelling two iraqis apparently 
for attempting to break the trade sanctions the home office said 
sunday the two must leave the country by tuesday because of their 
involvement in procurement on behalf of the government of iraq 
it provided no details 
in other developments 
the state department said sunday that secretary of state james 
a baker iii would discuss the persian gulf situation with canadas 
foreign minister joseph clark on tuesday in bermuda baker returned 
saturday from an eightday diplomatic mission to europe and the 
middle east where he consulted with officials from nine nations on 
the gulf crisis 
two american hostages released by iraq on friday have been 
discharged from a military hospital in wiesbaden germany a us 
air force spokesman said sunday spokesman capt tom gilroy said he 
did not know whether the two don and brenda swanke of westlake 
village calif would return home immediately 
some congressional democrats on sunday urged president bush to 
consult closely with allies and congress before launching any 
military offensive to oust iraq from kuwait the decision to go 
to war ought to be a shared responsibility it ought not to be made 
by one person even if that person is the president of the united 
states said rep lee hamilton dind senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine said congress must vote before america 
goes to war the two spoke in television interviews

an unknown disease sickened 300 university 
of colorado students over the weekend and state health officials 
said sunday they suspected food poisoning but could find no common 
cause 
the illness which broke out friday night and continued to 
plague students sunday at the oncampus wardenburg health center 
was characterized by vomiting lowgrade fever and diarrhea 
officials said those symptoms suggest food poisoning but the 
outbreak perplexed health officials because they had been unable to 
find a common food linking the cases the students ate in several 
dormitory cafeterias as well as off campus 
the majority of students were treated at wardenburg for 
dehydration and sent home two were hospitalized saturday night 
but health center officials would not comment about them sunday 
it appears to be a foodborne illness outbreak centered 
mostly in dorm residents said dennis lenaway an epidemiologist 
with the boulder county health department 
dr paul simon a state epidemiologist agreed that it was 
probably food poisoning but said health officials didnt know what 
kind 
it looks to me like its some sort of infectious disease 
food poisoning caused by an infection simon said but at this 
point we just dont have enough information 
if it is an infectionbased outbreak the students could have 
eaten the tainted food up to three days before becoming sick simon 
said 
there are so many dorms involved said dr ingrid hagan 
wardenburgs chief of staff i myself saw several patients that 
didnt eat in the dorms they ate off campus we took only a very 
brief history as far as what they ate but there doesnt seem to be 
a common denominator 
an additional 15 to 18 students went to boulder community 
hospital on friday said hospital spokeswoman kathy stephens none 
of those students was hospitalized 
county health officials delivered questionnaires to the 
dormitories on saturday in hope of pinpointing what caused the 
outbreak 
we hope to narrow it down to a meal or even better a food 
item were hoping we can get that detailed said lenaway 
well just have to see how things sort themselves out

a prosecutor said sunday he will seek 
the death penalty for a woman convicted of murdering five 
transients to cover up a cattle theft scheme 
the jury that convicted faye copeland on saturday was to return 
monday to decide between a life sentence or execution 
mrs copelands attorney david miller said he will request a 
new trial calling it a major issue that the judge did not 
allow a psychologist to testify about her husbands domination over 
her life 
mrs copelands husband 75yearold ray copeland is scheduled 
for trial jan 24 on murder charges in the case a court must first 
determine whether he is mentally competent to stand trial his 
lawyers contend he is senile 
a jury in livingston county in rural northwest missouri 
convicted mrs copeland 69 of five counts of firstdegree murder 
the bodies of the five men were found in fall 1989 near farms 
where copeland had done odd jobs after a tip from another drifter 
who had worked for the couple all had been shot in the head 
prosecutors said the couple had the transients open bank 
accounts in their names and buy cattle at various sales the 
copelands then resold the cattle keeping the proceeds and killing 
the transients before the checks could be traced they said 
townspeople had mixed feelings about mrs copelands part in the 
slayings 
there was feeling both ways said resident leroy butts who 
watched portions of the trial a lot of people felt kind of sorry 
for her but all those men were dead and you wonder how she didnt 
know anything about it 
mrs copeland buried her face in her hands and sobbed after the 
verdict was read saying i never done nothing 
miller said he will call a kansas city psychologist to testify 
about batteredwife syndrome during the trials penalty phase the 
testimony was ruled inadmissible during the trial 
miller said he would also call six other witnesses including 
family members to show a pattern of domination in mrs copelands 
life 
the defense had tried to prove she did not participate in the 
killings and was not privy to her husbands business dealings

mikhail s gorbachev and rival boris yeltsin met 
sunday in the kremlin and one report said they discussed emergency 
measures to feed the soviet people and reform their crumbling 
economy 
gorbachev the soviet president and yeltsin the president of 
the russian republic met oneonone for two hours the independent 
interfax news agency reported 
it was their first substantive meeting since an attempt at 
reconciliation over economic reform broke down in late summer 
the earlier failed attempt at reconciliation over economic 
policies put yeltsins russian republic on a collision course with 
the central soviet government 
the popular yeltsin whom gorbachev ousted from the communist 
party politburo in 1986 has criticized the soviet leader for not 
reforming fast enough 
after their private meeting gorbachev and yeltsin were joined 
by soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and two officials from the 
russian republic vice president ruslan khasbulatov and prime 
minister ivan silaev interfax said 
the conversation between gorbachev and yeltsin was conducted in 
a businesslike principled atmosphere interfax said without 
quoting any sources 
among the questions discussed were the russian republics role 
in possible radical economic reforms and urgent measures to 
provide food and consumer goods interfax said 
the official tass news agency also without quoting sources 
said the leaders discussed current problems the transition to 
a market economy and the union treaty gorbachevs plan for 
holding the splintering 15 soviet republics together as a loose 
confederation 
on nov 1 russia began its own 500day plan for converting to a 
free market economy conflicting with a more cautious plan endorsed 
by gorbachev and approved by the national legislature 
the republics legislature also has said that it and not the 
central government has the right to control russias considerable 
natural resources of oil coal and diamonds russia comprises about 
twothirds of the soviet union 
the disagreement which cast doubt on the success of soviet 
economic reforms has become a matter of sharp public debate with 
pleas to the two leaders to reconcile 
in a commentary sunday tass said the tug of war threatens to 
jeopardize all efforts 
in a letter published in sundays conservative sovietskaya 
rossiya newspaper yeltsin was criticized for his differences with 
gorbachev 
the path you are calling for is not russias right path 
said the authors a group of veterans from smolensk region west of 
moscow we condemn the policy of confrontation with the center 
that you yeltsin and many russian parliamentarians are 
pursuing 
radical legislator oleg kalugin a former kgb general and ardent 
gorbachev critic said sunday that gorbachev has to move closer 
to yeltsin or nothing constructive will come out of it 
gorbachev and yeltsin stood together on wednesdays revolution 
day holiday reviewing the traditional parade in red square 
although yeltsin also marched later that day in antigovernment 
demonstrations that urged gorbachev and other soviet leaders 
resign

stormie jones the worlds first heartliver 
transplant recipient died sunday at age 13 after a sixyear 
struggle that inspired wellwishers across the country 
the texas teenager was flown to pittsburghs childrens 
hospital from dallas late saturday after she complained of flulike 
symptoms at the hospital stormie deteriorated throughout the 
morning and died at 952 am said dr jorge reyes a staff 
physician 
she deserved more said teresa millikan a family friend who 
spearheaded efforts to raise funds for stormies hospital expenses 
she was gods walking angel she touched so many peoples 
hearts 
within hours of her arrival at the hospital stormies blood 
pressure dropped reyes said she became lethargic then suffered a 
heart attack he said doctors tried for more than an hour to 
resuscitate her 
she presented acute respiratory distress and had a cardiac 
arrest reyes told reporters 
things happened with incredible speed said hospital 
spokeswoman lynn mcmahon said stormie was alert when she was taken 
to childrens hospital and it had not appeared to be an emergency 
she said 
a preliminary autopsy performed sunday was inconclusive she 
said 
stormie was 6 when she received a heart and liver in a historic 
transplant operation feb 14 1984 the operation was necessary 
because she was born with a condition that put her cholesterol 
levels at 10 times normal 
hepatitis damaged that liver and this year she returned to 
pittsburgh and received a second liver feb 20 in july she was 
again treated for hepatitis which damaged her second transplanted 
liver 
doctors said it was a mystery how she contracted hepatitis 
stormie of the fort worth suburb of white settlement and her 
mother lois purcell left dallasfort worth international airport 
on saturday evening 
millikan said saturday that stormie had not been feeling well 
since midweek 
she doesnt feel good shes tired she said she hasnt 
been able to sleep for the past three nights shes had it pretty 
rough 
her daughter crystal who was stormies best friend said the 
ailing girl never felt comfortable under the medias glare and 
wanted more than anything to feel like a normal teenager 
she wished everybody would treat her normal instead of like 
she had an operation because she didnt like everybody asking her 
how she felt or if she was feeling ok crystal said tears 
welling in her eyes 
nobody in the world was as sweet or kind as her therell be 
nobody like her she said 
stormie who turned 13 in may had hoped to write an 
autobiography titled in the darkness the book was to be 
about my life my family all the pet animals ive had she 
said earlier this year 
the blonde teenager said she liked frightening books movies 
and television programs such as the cable horror series tales 
from the crypt and the movie pet sematary 
i feel better when i write my thoughts down stormie said 
stormie took the experimental antirejection drug fk506 which 
has been approved for testing exclusively at the university of 
pittsburgh a few exceptions have been made for patients elsewhere 
until a year ago stormie had been taking cyclosporine an 
antirejection drug that lowers the bodys ability to fight 
infection researchers say fk506 is more powerful and causes fewer 
side effects 
any transplant patient is susceptible to infection because 
antirejection drugs weaken the immune system reyes said 
i wouldnt particularly focus on the fk506 as a specific 
cause he said 
stormie was at the hospital for several hours before doctors 
could tell her heart was affected he said she got some sleep 
during the night and asked for water when she awoke reyes said 
her mother was at her side 
she was really with us 100 percent before this happened 
reyes said 
the hospital staff liked and admired stormie he said 
she was a happy girl she certainly enjoyed fighting us as 
much as she could reyes said 
stormie once bought a book on chinese to help her communicate 
with a 3yearold chinese fellow patient 
she did that kind of thing all the time said ms mcmahon 
the hospital spokeswoman she was just so highly regarded by 
other children she went to great length to take the time to play 
with them and talk with them 
ms mcmahon said the staff planned a memorial service funeral 
arrangements were pending

vandals knocked the head off the newly dedicated 
statue of a murdered priest who championed democracy in poland and 
scrawled for lenin for stalin along the statue base 
authorities said sunday 
the 9foottall 5footwide granite statue was dedicated oct 
28 in brooklyns greenpoint section to honor the rev jerzy 
popieluszko a prosolidarity roman catholic priest killed by 
polish secret police in 1984 more than 50000 polish immigrants 
live in greenpoint 
many of the 1000 parishioners attending the 11 am mass at our 
lady of consolation on sunday wept when the rev john lazar told 
them of the vandalism which occured overnight no one claimed 
responsibility 
many of the immigrants in the area are from the diocese where 
he served lazar said later many had heard his prosolidarity 
and anticommunist talks firsthand some of them knew him 
the head of the statue erected at the intersection of lorimer 
street and bedford avenue was found in a nearby trash can said 
police officer scott bloch the words za lenina za stalina 
polish for for lenin for stalin were scrawled in black paint 
on the statue base 
lazar said it was a tremendous triumph for many polish 
immigrants to see the statue dedicated at a ceremony attended by 
polish bishop joseph wysocki 
now there is shock and disbelief lazar said although 
the priest has been dead for six years he stays very much alive in 
the hearts and memories of the polish people 
he said some polish residents view the vandalism as an extension 
of the violence that caused popieluszkos death 
until the statue was dedicated private security guards watched 
the location because threats had been made that the statue would be 
defaced or destroyed lazar said 
popieluszko whose sermons bolstered the solidarity labor 
movement when it was outlawed was abducted oct 19 1984 his 
beaten and bound body was pulled from an icy river 11 days later 
shocking poland and galvanizing the anticommunist movement 
four secret policemen were convicted of the slaying

enthronement scheduled between 111130 pm est 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a solemn centuriesold rite at the imperial 
palace emperor akihito formally accedes to the chrysanthemum 
throne on monday becoming the first japanese monarch enthroned as 
a symbol and not a living god 
leftist radicals launched a series of attacks aimed at 
disrupting the ceremony they fired missiles at five military 
bases including a us naval base and were blamed with setting 
fires at religious shrines and train stations none of the attacks 
caused injuries 
a massive national security operation involving thousands of 
police was mounted to protect the ceremony and the scores of 
visiting dignitaries 
clad in ancient court costume seated atop an elaborate 
lacquered platform under a curtained canopy encrusted with gold 
phoenixes and circular mirrors akihito will face a courtyard lined 
with ceremonial banners 
next to him on a smaller platform will be empress michiko prime 
minister toshiki kaifu will lead the 2500 guests in three cheers 
of banzai may you live ten thousand years 
akihito began his morning rituals by offering private prayers at 
three wooden shrines inside the heavily guarded imperial palace to 
announce his enthronement to the sun goddess and ancestors 
critics say the 30minute ceremony and a series of 
accompanying rites to be held in coming weeks are based too 
closely on the traditional religious rituals used for akihitos 
father and grandfather who were enthroned as living gods 
under japans postwar constitution the emperor is simply a 
national symbol 
in one controversial element of the rite akihitos raised dais 
is said to be patterned after one used by the sun goddess from 
whom tradition says the japanese imperial line is descended 
critics say that is an implied symbol of divinity 
the government is reportedly spending 95 million on the rites 
much of it for security opponents say state funding of the 
ceremonies linked to japans indigenous shinto religion violates 
the constitutional separation of religion and state 
the radical left has been particularly incensed because of the 
legacy of imperial militarism in japan 
the projectiles were launched at three suburban bases of the 
military and at a base in western tokyo police said no damage was 
reported 
another missile was fired outside the us naval base at atsugi 
24 miles southwest of tokyo the base was apparently the target of 
that failed attack 
three train fires stopped service on two commuter lines and in 
separate incidents two major subway lines were shut down because 
of smoke 
fires also broke out at four shinto shrines in tokyo including 
one less than a mile from akihitos residence police said all were 
believed started by extremists 
no injuries were immediately reported but tw shrines were 
destroyed 
on sunday two bombs exploded at the house of us consul 
general gregory l johnson in nishinomiya in western japan police 
said they caused little damage and no injuries it was not 
immediately clear whether the explosions were connected with the 
enthronement 
a record 37000 police including reinforcements from a majority 
of japans 47 prefectures have been mobilized for security 
surrounding the rite security was particularly heavy around the 
downtown palace where akihito began his morning rituals by 
offering private prayers to the sun goddess at a wooden shrine 
dignitaries from 158 countries expected to attend the ceremony 
include vice president dan quayle united nations secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar supreme soviet chairman anatoly i 
lukyanov and britains prince charles and princess diana 
the government has not released the names of japanese 
dignitaries invited to the ceremony because of fear of radical 
attacks on their homes or businesses 
traffic was sharply restricted or halted along highways and in 
areas around the palace but few tieups were reported in part 
because enthronement day was declared a national holiday and many 
tokyoites took advantage of the threeday weekend to leave town 
airlines reported many flights were booked close to capacity 
akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father 
emperor hirohito in january 1989 but a period of mourning was 
observed before his formal enthronement 
akihito 56 was tutored after world war ii by an american 
pacifist and is the first emperor in modern japanese history to 
marry a commoner he and the empress also raised their three 
children themselves rather than have them raised separately by 
aides as was the imperial custom 
as with hirohitos funeral which was attended by 
representatives of 164 nations the enthronement provided 
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings kaifu was 
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials 
on monday evening the first of seven banquets scheduled over 
five days is to be held at the imperial palace with senior 
japanese officials and foreign dignitaries attending

relatives of american troops in the persian gulf 
set up a new family support group sunday that opposes a us 
military offensive there 
the military families support network was organized by the 
author of an angry open letter to president bush that was 
publised in the new york times alex molnar the father of a 
marine in saudi arabia says the group has 2500 members and 
chapters in eight states 
this is the first time i know of that military families and 
patriotic mainstream americans are among the first to voice doubts 
over american policy he said in a statement 
molnars letter to the president published aug 23 expressed 
concerns and fears about the military buildup in the persian gulf 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
molnar an education professor at the university of wisconsin in 
milwaukee said he received a flood of telephone calls after the 
letter appeared and decided to form the group 
the organization has chapters in new york california texas 
nebraska illinois south carolina north carolina and tennessee 
molnar said 
the group wants bush to invoke the war powers act and allow 
congress to decide whether the united states goes to war however 
the organization is calling for a diplomatic solution to the 
crisis 
the group also supports united nations resolutions condemning 
iraq and imposing economic sanctions but it opposes the massive 
deployment of american ground forces or a military offensive 
molnar said money raised by the group would be used for an 
advertising campaign 
the vietnam war generation it seems is not about to send its 
children and family members into another war with questionable 
moral grounding without a cry for public debate and the consensus 
of the american people he said

rain put a damper on the first day of 
the world solar challenge race sunday wiping out any chance at the 
record pace organizers had predicted 
darwins first consistently rainy day since may delayed the 
start by an hour a crowd of several thousand cheered as the event 
got under way with the announcement gentlemen start your solar 
panels 
mostly overcast conditions persisted as the cars headed south 
toward adelaide 1875 miles away with the 36 cars from nine 
countries spread out over 90 miles a torrential rain forced many 
drivers to stop and cover their cars 
it was amazing that the satellite maps showed the only real 
cloud over australia this morning was over darwin said race 
organizer hans tholstrup 
the entry from western washington university at bellingham 
wash took the early lead over biel university of switzerland 
the leaders were not expected to cover more than 300 miles the 
first day the winner of the inaugural event in 1987 general 
motors sunraycer traveled almost 450 miles in one day to set a 
record 
western washingtons car has fore and aft driver positions so 
the vehicle can point in either direction to take best advantage of 
the suns position 
speeds were expected to pick up once the cloud cover dissipated 
the cars race nine hours each day usually stopping before 5 pm 
sunraycer the 1987 winner averaged 42 mph and hit a top speed 
of 71 mph it reached adelaide in 44 hours and 54 minutes over 
five days 
for much of the route through desolate central australia there 
are no trees just scrub brush grass rocks and usually plenty of 
sun the temperature in the outback can exceed 120 
entered are 11 cars each from australia and japan eight from 
the united states and one each from canada switzerland germany 
denmark new zealand and england 
the prize is a trophy of a globe topped by the sun 
with oil prices skyrocketing interest in the solar race is 
keener than for the first event three years ago 
retired american real estate developer j ward phillips said 
more than 234 million worth of technology was taking part in what 
he grandly described as the most significant event in the history 
of the universe 
the lineup reads like a whos who of engineering and 
automotive technology 
gm is sponsoring the top three finishers in a july university 
race from florida to detroit japans honda research and 
development co ltd has an entry and the only british car under 
the name of phil farrand is actually from the williams formula one 
grand prix team 
the solar car has come so far that gm has unveiled a prototype 
production model the impact which it claims will outaccelerate a 
mazda mx5 sports car to 60 mph 
japans kyocera corp with an 11member team estimates it 
invested 546000 to enter its blue eagle in this years race 
gm spent about 39 million on sunraycer now housed in the 
smithsonian institution in washington dc 
the difference is due to advancements in silicon cells which 
cost a small fraction of the gallium arsenide cells used for 
sunraycer

prosecution of old rape cases that were 
reopened for investigation is unlikely because alleged victims have 
been difficult to find or are unwilling to cooperate police said 
the 228 cases were reopened in september after it was revealed 
one in four reported rapes and attempted rapes last year were 
classified by police as unfounded meaning police determined 
the rapes did not occur 
police conceded at the time that some of the victims were never 
contacted by investigators after the initial report many of the 
alleged victims were cocaine users prostitutes or acquainted with 
their assailants police and rape crisis workers said 
subsequent investigation found 79 of 112 alleged rapes reviewed 
so far did occur but the prospect for arrests and prosecution is 
slim oakland police capt james hahn said 
in some cases investigators were unable to contact victims 
either because they gave incorrect addresses or moved in other 
instances the victims did not respond to investigators or said 
they did not want to prosecute 
some said they were getting their life together and didnt 
want to pursue the case hahn said one lady cursed 
investigators 
of 19 cases that remain unfounded police determined one was 
reported by a mother who wanted to prevent her daughter from having 
an affair another was reported by a person other than the victim 
who told police she had not been raped hahn said those were 
typical of the reasons the rest of the 19 are still considered 
unfounded 
a review of all 228 cases will be completed by next month and 
presented to the city council hahn said

the computer industry will trot out new 
products and crank up its promotion machine as the worlds largest 
annual computer show opens here monday but the hype may be 
overshadowed by the looming recession 
computer sales have been slowing for several years with the 
economy as a whole entering a slump the industrys outlook could 
darken further 
domestic sales of personal computers fell about 25 percent in 
september compared with the first eight months of the year 
according to prudentialbache securities inc 
however the economic downturn is not among the dozens of 
industry and technical topics scheduled for panel discussions 
during the show called comdex fall in typical tradeshow fashion 
the official patter will be upbeat 
among issues that will be addressed by industry experts are 
multimedia computing or the use of video photographs and 
animation on computers a related technology called image 
processing portable computers and business opportunities in the 
new europe 
the keynote speaker is bill gates the young chairman of 
software powerhouse microsoft corp gates is scheduled to talk 
monday about the evolution of personal computing and its future 
gates company has been in the news this year for its software 
that gives international business machines corp computers and 
compatible models many of the easeofuse features of apple 
computer incs macintosh microsoft says it has sold more than 1 
million copies of the windows 3 software since its june 
introduction 
also scheduled to speak is gilbert hyatt an engineer who in 
july was granted a patent for his work in developing the 
microprocessor the patent award called into question the computer 
industrys official history which says the computeronachip was 
invented by several intel corp scientists 
one of the more important bits of news expected at comdex wont 
be announced at a flashy news conference instead semiconductor 
maker advanced micro devices inc will give private demonstrations 
of its new product a clone of intels extremely popular 386 
microprocessor 
the 386 chip is the brains of an increasing number of ibm 
personal computers and compatible models amd says its chip is even 
better than the original 
however the company doesnt plan a fullscale announcment at 
the show because it has not set the price or availability date for 
the chip said amd spokesman david frink 
apart from the panel discussions one of the major attractions 
of comdex to those in the industry are the acres and acres of 
computer products on display among the more intriguing devices 
will be tiny personal computers called notepads and other portable 
computers that recognize handwriting 
comdex is billed as the nations largest annual trade show it 
virtually takes over las vegas this week with 118000 
conventioneers overflowing hotel rooms and more than 1800 product 
exhibitors from 22 countries cramming onto display floors at the 
las vegas convention center and five hotels 
the 12yearold gathering is a forum for major computer makers 
to attract new distributors for their products it also is used by 
tiny startup companies to gain a foothold in the vast computer 
market 
though the show is aimed primarily at computer sellers it draws 
computer experts and insiders of all sorts from trade letter 
editors to wall street analysts about 1800 members of the press 
are expected organizers say 
however comdex appears to be losing some of its luster as a 
place for computer companies to make major announcements some 
observers say 
you get lost in the noise said esther dyson publisher of 
the computer newsletter release 10 and a comdex veteran plus she 
added with the growth of other computer industry gatherings 
its no longer the big event of the year 
the industry is getting less cohesive there are so many 
different parts and interest groups she said
