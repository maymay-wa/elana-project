president reagan is barring from the united 
states panamanian government and military officials known to 
support gen manuel antonio noriega 
in a proclamation the president friday said noriega and his 
handpicked president manuel solis palma are preventing the 
legitimate government of president eric arturo delvalle from 
restoring order and democracy in that country 
i have determined that it is in the interests of the united 
states to restrict the entrance into the united states as 
immigrants and nonimmigrants of certain persons who formulate or 
implement the policies of noriega and solis palma said reagan 
the proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect until such time as the secretary of state determines that 
democracy has been restored in panama the president said 
the reagan administration has tried unsuccessfully to get 
noriega who is under indictment on drug trafficking charges in 
florida to yield power to delvalle in panama 
a us official said the order might affect several hundred 
panamanians 
the move prompted a quick denunciation and a threat of 
retaliation by the panamanian government 
we could not care less about any lists made up by the reagan 
administration said boris moreno director of the panamanian 
national information service in panama city 
the united states is free to make as many lists as it wants of 
panamanians it does not want to admit there just as we can make 
our lists of us citizens we do not want in panama 
under the presidents proclamation secretary of state george p 
shultz will designate those panamanian nationals who with their 
families will be barred from entering the united states because of 
their role in aiding noriegas regime 
panamanians on the list who attempt to come to the united states 
would be stopped at us ports of entry or they would be denied 
visas at us consular offices the official said 
the president said the order would be enforce so as not conflict 
with international obligations of the united states or prohibit the 
entry of individuals into the united states to submit to us 
government legal proceedings 
the purpose of the declaration is in a very ungentle manner 
to let noriegas supporters know that their continuing support for 
him is not going to be without some personal cost said a state 
department official asking not to be identified 
the last time such a restriction was imposed occurred in 1985 
when most nonimmigrant cubans were prevented from entering the 
united states

feeling among people and between people and thats something that 
should be resurrected

a leader nicaraguan resistance leader says 
contra forces could face annihilation at the hands of the 
sandinistas unless the united states resumes military aid to the 
rebels 
the contra leader adolfo calero said friday at a news 
conference the aid was needed because of sandinista threats to wipe 
out the insurgents if the latest round of peace talks did not 
produce a final settlement to the nicaraguan war 
peace talks between the leftist sandinista government and the 
contras collapsed in managua thursday although both sides said a 
temporary truce would remain in effect 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan was 
disappointed at the sandinista rejection of the nicaraguan 
resistance proposal to achieve democracy and an end to the war in 
nicaragua 
the reagan administration blamed the nicaraguan government for 
the breakdown in talks but said no decision had been made about 
whether to ask congress for more aid for the insurgents 
i think that in view of the sandinistas actions here their 
unwillingness to negotiate in good faith their unwillingness to 
instill democratic reforms you may well see a press for contra aid 
from members of the congress and from people in nicaragua and from 
other sources but at this point we have made no decisions said 
fitzwater 
meanwhile rep jack kemp rny urged the white house to 
propose an aid package for the contras that matches the amount of 
military assistance he said the soviet union provided to the 
sandinista government during the first three months of this year 
he put the amount at 105 million 
calero indicated he felt that was a reasonable amount the 
rebels have received no military aid since feb 29 the house 
rejected president reagans last military aid request for the 
contras on feb 3 
but rep david bonior dmich a leader of the anticontra 
forces in the house said this is no time to be talking of 
military aid he called for additional efforts to achieve a peace 
settlement before a new military aid request is considered 
the goal of the latest negotiating round which began on 
tuesday was to end the war and install democratic reforms in 
accordance with a preliminary peace plan signed on march 23 in 
sapoa nicaragua 
the discussions had been described as the fourth and final round 
of a series which have taken place under an interim truce

jesse jackson back in his home territory for the 
weekend says he hopes to help forge an economic alliance among 
farmers and industrial workers 
we want to bring people beyond racism beyond sexism and 
beyond antisemitism said jackson in brief statements to 
reporters late friday as he arrived in chicago from a campaign 
swing in california 
jackson said he would unveil his new plans today in a speech at 
the headquarters of operation push the civil rights group he 
founded 
the candidate said his latest 40day campaign plan would focus 
on economic proposals 
well focus on ways to protect workers farmers the aged and 
the poor against the ravages of reagonomics he said 
jackson was asked about polls indicating he would hurt 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis as a running mate against the 
republican ticket headed by george bush 
if we are within four points of bush before the race begins 
we have the capacity to win jackson replied 
jackson came in second place to dukakis in delegate and popular 
vote count in the democratic primaries but a survey published in 
the washington post suggested he would hurt the ticket among groups 
whose support the democrats need to win in the fall 
and another poll conducted for usa today and cable news 
network indicated a dukakisled ticket with jesse jackson as the 
running mate would lose to george bush 47 percent to 40 percent 
otherwise dukakis would win 45 percent to 39 percent the survey 
suggested 
dukakis has said only that jackson deserves to be considered 
not that he has any special claim on the job 
confusion over jacksons position on the matter has been 
heightened in recent days by a cable news network report that 
quoted him as saying he wants to be vice president 
lets leave it at consideration jackson said friday in 
california when asked to clarify the matter 
jackson has said he deserves to be offered a spot on the ticket 
but the abc newspost survey found that twothirds of democratic 
voters believe the nominee has the right to choose anyone he 
wants as a running mate only three in 10 said the second spot on 
the ticket should automatically go to the secondplace finisher in 
the primaries the poll said 
the abcpost poll said jackson was the vice presidential choice 
of 36 percent of all registered democrats however nearly 
onequarter of those surveyed said they would be less likely to 
vote for dukakis if jackson were on the ticket only 12 percent 
said they would be more likely to vote democratic with jackson in 
the no 2 spot the poll said 
earlier friday jackson said in california that he has better 
credentials than anyone else in politics to be the democratic vice 
presidential nominee 
while others may be qualified jackson said none has shown 
ability to win 7 million votes as he did in the primary season or 
has his combination of regional and political strengths to balance 
a ticket headed by dukakis 
we meet virtually every stated qualification for serious 
consideration on the ticket he said no one else at this point 
thats active in politics has shown the breadth of support i have 
shown at the voting polls no one else has shown the ability to 
impact on the countrys tone and the partys priorities 
they may have state credentials theyve not shown themselves 
to have national votegetting potential jackson told reporters 
who accompanied him to a twoday working vacation at the posh la 
costa health spa north of san diego 
jackson left la costa friday afternoon to head to return to 
chicago where he planned to meet with civil rights leaders and 
continue plans for the convention 
although visibly tired and talking very softly after his long 
flight jackson brought a touch of california casualness to the 
chilly chicago night 
the often soberly dressed candidate was wearing blue jeans 
leather sandals and a black jacket bearing the emblem of the 
international longshoremens and warehousemens union he also wore 
a silver pin in the form of a stevedores pick a symbol of the 
union

foreign policies youre looking at a guy whos been getting hit 
for six months guilt by association and all kinds of personal

israel and norway have agreed that norwegian 
experts can inspect a shipment of norwegian heavy water a chemical 
used in the production of nuclear weapons 
foreign trade minister kurt mosbakk told parliament on friday 
that an agreement on the inspection was negotiated by israel and 
norway in oslo earlier this week the national news agency ntb 
reported 
the news agency said mosbakk told parliament that about half of 
the 20 tons of heavy water sold to israel in 1959 had vanished 
through waste and evaporation 
norwegian experts would be allowed to inspect the remaining 
half ntb said 
when norway sold israel the water almost 30 years ago the 
contract stipulated that norway had the right to inspect the water 
and that it could be used for peaceful purposes only 
norway did not raise the question of inspection until israeli 
nuclear technician mordechai vanunu told a british newspaper that 
israel had used heavy water to produce plutonium for use in nuclear 
weapons vanunu is serving an 18year prison term in israel for 
treason 
in three previous rounds of negotiations about the inspection 
issue israel rejected a norwegian proposal to transfer its 
inspection right to the viennabased international atom energy 
agency 
since norway started production of heavy water in the late 
1930s about 450 tons have been exported mostly for scientific 
research ten countries including israel received amounts large 
enough for use in nuclear reactors 
two nuclear powers france and britain received heavy water 
from norway on the condition that they did no reexport it seven 
other import countries have signed the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty which allows onsite inspection israel has not signed the 
treaty

panama shrugged off washingtons move 
to ban from the united states panamanian officials supporting gen 
manuel antonio noriega and warned that panama could bar us 
officials also 
the ban announced friday in washington was the latest in a 
series of steps the united states has taken in recent months to 
show displeasure with panamas leader 
president reagans order bars from the united states top 
panamanian government and military officials known to back noriega 
the countrys military commander and the power behind its civilian 
government 
a state department official said the order would probably affect 
several hundred panamanians 
boris moreno director of panamas national information service 
responded to the order friday by saying we could not care less 
about any lists made up by the reagan administration 
the united states is free to make as many lists as it wants of 
panamanians it does not want to admit there just as we can make 
our lists of us citizens we do not want in panama he said 
the reagan administration has imposed sweeping economic 
sanctions against panama in an effort to force the ouster of 
noriega who was indicted in february by a federal grand jury in 
florida on drugtrafficking charges 
romulo escobar bethancourt president of the progovernment 
democratic revolutionary party said friday that the united states 
scuttled an offer by colombia to provide 70 million in aid to help 
panama through the financial crunch caused by the sanctions 
he said the panamanian government first negotiated with japan 
and taiwan and when those discussions broke down it turned to 
colombia which agreed to provide the money if it would be returned 
when uspanamanian relations improved 
then the us insulted colombia and blocked the negotiations 
by saying the colombian money came from drug trafficking escobar 
bethancourt said 
about 50 million in panamanian government assets has been 
frozen in us banks panama uses the us dollar as its currency 
in announcing the ban on panamanian government officials reagan 
said noriega and his handpicked president manuel solis palma 
are preventing the legitimate government of president eric arturo 
delvalle from restoring order and democracy in that country 
delvalle was deposed by the national assembly in february the 
day after he tried to fire noriega 
after he was ousted his family took refuge in the us 
ambassadors residence and delvalle apparently spends much time 
there he often meets there with englishspeaking journalists who 
are asked not to disclose the location 
at other times according to sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity delvalle stays in safe homes provided by the us 
government at its military installations in panama 
if they want him delvalle to reestablish democracy as they 
say let him come out of his little pentagon in the us bases 
here moreno said

a jury will be asked to decide next week 
whether evan mecham and his brother committed a crime when they 
failed to itemize a 350000 campaign loan a case the former 
governor insists is based on smoke and mirrors 
the defense rested friday in the trial of mecham and his 
brother willard without calling either defendant to the stand 
during the seven days of testimony the maricopa county superior 
court jury is to hear final arguments on tuesday before starting 
deliberations 
im confident that the state has not proved its case 
mecham 64 told reporters as he left the courtroom friday 
the former governor stopped short of predicting acquittal but 
said i think the smoke and mirrors that this whole thing has 
been created by has been totally revealed to the world 
however coprosecutor michael cudahy said i think the state 
position is even stronger after the witnesses called by the 
defense 
judge michael ryan denied the mechams requests for a directed 
verdict in which the judge would render a verdict without the case 
going to the jury 
evan and willard mecham who was his brothers 1986 campaign 
treasurer are charged with concealing the 350000 campaign loan 
on financial reports required by the state 
the defense contended the loan was properly reported as part of 
a 465000 lump sum listed as a contribution from mecham the 
defense also said the failure to itemize the loan was an innocent 
mistake 
but the prosecution maintained the mecham campaign badly needed 
the 350000 loan and feared disclosing that it came from developer 
barry wolfson because mechams campaign theme was one of being 
beholden to no one 
the wolfson loan was not itemized on either mechams campaign or 
personal financial disclosure forms 
during fridays testimony cudahy sought to establish that evan 
mecham was personally responsible for the failure to report the 
loan because he reported his finances as a candidate rather than a 
committee 
anyone who looked at mechams financial reports would not know 
mecham borrowed 350000 from wolfson cudahy contended while 
questioning secretary of state jim shumway whose office is 
responsible for accepting such reports 
does the name barry wolfson appear anywhere on the 
postgeneral contribution and expenditure report filed by evan 
mecham at your office cudahy asked shumway a defense witness 
i dont see any contributor by that name shumway answered 
mecham is on trial on six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faces up to 22 years in 
prison if convicted on all counts his brother is charged with 
three similar counts and faces up to 9 years in prison if 
convicted 
mecham a republican took office in january 1987 he was 
removed from office april 4 when the state senate convicted him of 
two unrelated impeachment counts

necessity may be the mother of 
invention but the possiblity of making a million dollars seems to 
help 
an attorney who helped organize the 31st annual minnesota 
inventors congress says some gadget makers come with dollar signs 
in their eyes 
some are quite naive said william braddock a minneapolis 
patent attorney they will come and say ive got this invention 
it works where do i go to get my million dollars its often that 
simplistic we try to put them on the right road 
david ludvigson of sioux falls sd said a harrowing 
experience led to his invention 
i was almost killed off by a kid on a skateboard one night so 
i went home and invented the thrasher flasher said ludvigson 
a camera repairman and participant in the threeday inventors 
congress which began friday 
his thrasher flasher is essentially a headlight for a 
skateboard its a lowintensity strobe light attached to the 
boards wheel axle 
like many of the 88 exhibitors and 108 inventors at the 
congress ludvigson is hoping someone will spot the flasher and 
decide to market it 
people come to the congress which has been held annually in 
redwood falls since 1958 not only to get exposure and to market 
their ideas but also to find direction 
others come to get the publics reaction to their inventions 
said andrew amoroso a business development specialist from the 
us small business administration 
they want to know is there any market for my products i 
have shown it to my family and they all think it is a good idea 
but what about john q public what is he going to think about 
it amoroso said 
some people such as brothers darrell vernon and richard fox of 
langdon nd are compulsive inventors and design products after 
seeing a need for it 
they invented an aluminum can crusher an electrical contraption 
that hangs on the rim of garbage cans and crushes cans 
we saw that whole cans were really causing space problems 
darrell fox said

the reagan administration has asked congress 
to make it a felony to strip mine coal without a permit 
legislation proposed friday by the office of surface mining 
reclamation and enforcement which calls for a maximum prison term 
of five years for people convicted of mining without a permit is 
seen as the administrations attempt to get tough with coal 
wildcatters 
the civil procedures are so ponderous its difficult to keep 
up with the wildcatters said office spokesman alan cole 
strip mining without a permit is now a civil offense with a top 
penalty of 22500 but the bill also would allow a judge to impose 
a fine of up to 250000 against a convicted individual and a fine 
of up to 500000 against a convicted organization

unesco officials have backed away from a proposal 
to create a global communications order that some western nations 
viewed as a threat to the freedom of the press 
the us observer to unesco cautiously praised the 
recommendations released by the groups executive board friday 
the new communications strategy played down establishing a new 
world information and communication order the concept lay at the 
heart of a decadeold debate at the 158nation un educational 
scientific and cultural organization and helped convince the united 
states and britain to withdraw 
the boards recommendations go to unesco director general 
federico mayor who is trying to persuade those two nations to 
rejoin 
the reports communications section admitted that journalists 
had widely interpreted unescos efforts to establish a new world 
order as aimed at undermining freedom of information 
this resulted in a misunderstanding that was used to sully the 
organizations image it said 
the section said unesco should explore the possibilities of a 
new strategy that will dispel the misunderstanding 
it said the strategy should emphasize development of critical 
acumen among media users the ability for individuals and 
communities to react to any kind of manipulation by the media and 
to become familiair with the means available to users to defend 
their right of reply 
the section also said unesco should seek to ensure a free and 
wider and more balanced flow of information 
in the past western governments and media groups have tried to 
replace the words more balanced with unrestricted 
these governments and western media groups expressed concern 
that the proposed new world communications order could lead to 
codes of conduct and licensing of journalists 
us observer richard t miller said the latest recommendations 
approved by consensus without a vote contained scope for 
positive change 
however i am distressed at the tone in the communications 
section which tries to set up an adversary relationship between 
the media and its audience 
the boards recommendations presented at the end of its spring 
meeting are intended to guide mayor in preparation of unescos 
plan of activities for the l990s 
at the boards opening meeting three weeks ago mayor a spanish 
scientist who took office in november proposed that unescos 14 
major programs be reduced to five he suggested that the 
organization should do fewer things but do them better and with 
more followup 
the board has recommended cutting programs to seven it added 
one dealing with peace human rights and elimination of 
discrimination and another that covers development studies 
a group of 77 third world countries and the soviet bloc 
criticized mayor for dropping these programs from his plan for the 
1990s 
along with communications the peace and human rights proposals 
have provoked controversial debates in the past 
mayor will use the document prepared by the board to draft an 
outline of the plan for the 1990s for the fall meeting of the board

yugoslavias increasingly open press 
has reported that federal authorities were worried about a popular 
uprising if they seized control in slovenia the nations most 
liberal republic 
the ruling communist party meanwhile called for radical 
economic changes on friday including freer profitoriented 
markets and more foreign investment to overcome yugoslavias 
deepening economic crisis 
reports have circulated for several weeks that military 
authorities in slovenia were thinking about stepping in to quell 
liberal tendencies in the northernmost of yugoslavias six 
republics 
federal officials and communist leaders in the republic have 
denied any plans for such an action 
but nin magazine on friday published what it said were excerpts 
of a transcript of a discussion of the police role after such a 
takeover a police official whom the magazine did not identify 
was quoted as speaking of police ability to control the situation 
after the arrests since it is believed that the people will come 
out into the streets 
nin also quoted igor bavcar a spokesman for a group formed to 
fight the arrests of two journalists who first wrote of the alleged 
takeover as saying the transcript means nobody believes that the 
stories about the coup have been fabricated 
authorities have denied any link between the journalists report 
on the takeover and their arrests last week by military authorities 
police have said the journalists were arrested along with a 
soldier after an unmarked document on combat readiness was found in 
their possession 
bavcar said his group would decide this weekend whether or not 
to call for a 15minute general strike next tuesday in protest at 
the arrests 
the slovenian daily delo reported from ljubljana that more than 
7000 people have signed a petition calling for the release of the 
trio 
money is pouring into a special account to help the families of 
those held and more than 200 companies communist party cells and 
trade union groups have backed the petition for release delo said 
slovenias official lawyers union issued a statement saying 
public unease over the case should be seen as popular concern over 
preserving gains of democratization 
state organs cannot any longer demand in advance uncritical 
trust from the people the lawyers said calling for strict 
adherence to the law in the handling of the controversial case 
the partys 52page blueprint for economic change largely 
adopted at a party conference last month advocated the 
strengthening of market mechanisms and recomended measures to 
attract the investment of more foreign capital in the yugoslav 
economy 
it said the party supported investment of private funds in 
small businesses as a means of restructuring the economy and 
overcoming high unemployment 
the theses call for sweeping economic reforms to ensure the 
autonomy of enterprises the full affirmation of all elements of 
the market and of economic laws a single home market and an 
opening to the world the document said 
yugoslavia suffers from 150 percent inflation a 21 billion 
debt worker unrest and heavily endebted firms 
the government recently undertook a strict austerity program 
curbing wages and spending as part of sweeping changes to be 
completed before the end of the year 
one of the partys most radical proposals is to base the 
economy for the first time on the profit motive ending the 
practice of subsidizing and when necessary rescuing moneylosing 
enterprises 
the party blueprint also contained a reference to human rights 
widely seen as a victory for a liberal faction in the party

a man whose doctoral dissertation was rejected by 
a faculty committee in 1942 but hailed by historians four decades 
later as a pioneering work has received his phd 
celebrity is a new status and its hard to get used to 
frank bourgin who gained national attention earlier this year when 
his dissertation was finally accepted said friday 
but if all this hoopla wasnt going on i think id be feeling 
quite depressed said the 77yearold retired civil servant who 
lives in chevy chase md my polio is acting up my walking 
ability is reduced and im having difficulty getting out of a chair 
but this attention the commencement he added is such 
great compensation 
bourgin was a graduate student at chicago and a disciple of the 
late professor charles merriam the leading political scientist of 
the day and a member of thenpresident franklin d roosevelts 
circle of advisers known as the brain trust 
under merriams guidance bourgin reexamined the history of 
government planning in the united states he then argued in his 
dissertation that the countrys early leaders alexander hamilton 
and thomas jefferson among them had intended to use the powers of 
the federal government to develop the fledgling nations resources 
through public works and other projects 
the paper challenged the thencommon conviction that roosevelts 
new deal social programs marked a departure from laissezfaire 
principles attributed to the founding fathers 
by the time his paper was rejected as not yet in satisfactory 
shape bourgin was married with a child to support he said he 
couldnt afford to return to campus as a fulltime student to 
revise his manuscript so he locked it away in a box 
in the intervening years he manufactured light fixtures owned 
a chain of mens clothing stores in minnesota and became a federal 
civil servant eventually rising to become regional director for 
the federal office of emergency planning supervising a fivestate 
region in the midwest 
but i never changed my mind on the essential idea id 
developed in my paper he recalled i maintained my interest in 
history i looked everywhere and whenever i read i was constantly 
looking to see if someone else had it 
i was so convinced i was right and so convinced of the 
importance of it that tenacity was the easy part he said 
bourgins reward came last year when he read historian arthur 
schlesinger jrs cycles of american history a chapter of 
which made essentially the same argument bourgins paper had 
offered nearly a halfcentury earlier 
he wrote to schlesinger who looked at the dissertation and 
wrote back congratulations on your pathbreaking work i am 
astonished by the fate of your thesis at chicago 
emboldened bourgin set in process a motion that culminated 
friday with bourgin receiving his doctorate 
im not sure how the paper was rejected the first time but my 
best guess is that after professor merriam retired my dissertation 
became a kind of orphan 
also i was already working at making a living while it was 
being considered and i think the chairman of the department at the 
time may not have wanted the degree cheapened by giving it to 
someone who wouldnt use it bourgin said 
i dont know if all that makes it any sweeter he said 
but it certainly has made the last few months of my life an 
interesting time

a 90minute meeting with two highlevel vatican 
officials gave the underground ukrainian catholic church much 
hope and strength one of its lay leaders said 
also friday the 1000th anniversary of russian christendom was 
marked with a gala at the bolshoi theater attended by raisa 
gorbachev wife of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev american 
evangelist billy graham and rabbi arthur schneier head of the 
appeal of conscience foundation of new york were among the 
speakers 
the meeting and the appearance of the soviet leaders wife at a 
religious event underscored the changing attitude of the communist 
party which is officially atheist 
the meeting of vatican and ukrainian clergymen at a moscow 
hotel the first official one since soviet leader josef stalin 
crushed the church more than 40 years ago was kept quiet by both 
sides 
the meeting was very warm and fruitful it gave us much hope 
and strength said ivan gel a lay leader of the ukrainian 
catholic church who accompanied the church delegation to the hotel 
members of the delegation said two bishops and three priests of 
the ukrainian catholic church met at the hotel with two cardinals 
from the vatican secretary of state agostino casaroli and johannes 
willebrands head of the secretariat for christian unity 
gel said previous contacts were informal at lower levels and 
fridays meeting would not have been possible without the reforms 
gorbachev is making in soviet society 
it lasted 90 minutes three times longer than scheduled gel 
said 
vatican officials would not talk about the meeting members of 
the ukrainian delegation canceled a news conference saying they 
had promised not to discuss it further and were returning to the 
ukraine later friday 
no information was available about whether pope john paul ii 
addressed the issue of ukrainian catholics in a letter to gorbachev 
brought by casaroli the no 2 vatican official 
religious groups must be registered with the government which 
puts strict limits on the practice of religion officials have not 
recognized ukrainian catholic groups making their religious 
services illegal 
officials say the ukrainian catholic church numbers 45 million 
believers primarily in the western ukraine it was forcibly 
assimilated into the russian orthodox church in 1946 when stalin 
consolidated his control over lands captured at the end of world 
war ii 
gel said 11 bishops were imprisoned under stalin and only three 
survived to carry on the consecration of other bishops and priests 
bishops safron kurchaba and pavlo vasilik led the ukrainian 
church delegation to the meeting friday said gel who did not 
attend although he accompanied the group to the sovietskaya hotel 
the russian orthodox church opposes recognition of the ukrainian 
church but has said it will discuss the issue with vatican 
representatives in finland later this month 
others at the bolshoi said mrs gorbachev dressed in a gray 
suit and red blouse sat in the front row of about 80 church and 
government dignitaries 
schneier said mrs gorbachev blushed when he turned from the 
audience faced her and said alluding to the biblical story of 
creation 
you have been a trusted and devoted helpmate to your husband 
your presence here is more than symbolic it shows that as his 
helpmate you are in sympathy with his cause and in support of his 
pronouncements on the rights of believers 
graham said he was encouraged by reports that there is a new 
readiness on the part of both churches and the state to face the 
mistakes of the past and to seek together to find new ways of 
expanding the religious rights and opportunities of believers and 
religious groups within the framework of your socialist society 
according to a text of his remarks 
patriarch pimen head of the russian orthodox church called 
gorbachev a tireless architect of perestroika and a herald of new 
political thinking the official news agency tass reported

union leaders criticized the suffolk 
county executive for his veto of a bill that would have made the 
county the nations first major municipality to regulate video 
display terminals 
im outraged at the county executives submissiveness to the 
business community whose arguments of the cost of the legislation 
are innocuous and untrue state aflcio president edward j 
cleary saud friday 
but executive patrick halpin told reporters that several 
businesses threatened to leave the county or cancel relocation 
plans if he signed the legislation 
in both cases the consequence would be hundreds if not 
thousands of jobs lost and these are losses that i do not think 
suffolk can afford halpin said 
under the bill employers would be required to pay 80 percent of 
the cost of eye examinations glass lenses and frames on a yearly 
basis if needed 
it also required 15minute work breaks every three hours and 
outlined strict work station standards including what type of 
chairs should be used adjustability of the terminals and office 
lighting 
this law would cost local businesses millions of dollars to 
implement at the same time that their competitors in other areas 
faced no restrictions halpin said this would be an economic 
disadvantage to them of no small consequence 
donald rechler chairman of the association for a better long 
island a group of 40 developers said after the veto was announced 
friday the economy of suffolk county has just breathed a sigh of 
relief 
the legislature could override halpins veto with 12 votes the 
measure was originally approved by 13 of the 18 legislators

yasser arafats palestinian guerrillas 
and syrianbacked dissidents battled for control of two beirut 
refugee camps for the fourth day today police reported eight 
people killed and 17 wounded 
that raised the casualty toll since fighting erupted wednesday 
in the bourj elbarajneh and chatilla camps to 18 dead and 77 
wounded by police count 
police said arafats fatah faction the main component of the 
palestine liberation organization and col saeed mousas 
fatahuprising battled with howitzers mortars rocketpropelled 
grenades and machine guns 
the fighting raged despite efforts by a security commitee made 
up of representatives from several palestinian groups to arrange a 
cease fire 
several ceasefire calls overnight were ignored said a 
police spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
a fatah spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said his 
guerrillas repulsed several overnight attacks from outside the 
camps by mousas fighters 
arafat loyalists had dislodged mousas guerrillas from both 
shantytowns in a series of battles over the last two months but 
the dissidents have regrouped on the fringes of the shantytowns 
where syrian troops are in control 
mousa broke away from the plo in a syrianinspired 1983 mutiny 
against arafats leadership and established his headquarters in 
damascus the syrtian capital 
clashes between the rival groups have persisted in the beirut 
camps despite a reconciliation effort between arafat and syrian 
president hafez assad to end their 5yearold feud

southern and central californians were jolted 
by a strong earthquake that sent rocks flying onto a freeway and 
closed an aqueduct that supplies half of los angeles water 
three people in nearby whittier were injured by a falling 
avocado tree in fridays earthquake one woman was treated at the 
scene and two men were taken to a hospital for tests 
the quake forced the closure of the 440milelong california 
aqueduct when power to at least two pumping plants was knocked out 
the temblor measuring 52 on the richter scale struck at 406 
pm and was centered on the garlock fault 11 miles 
northnortheast of gorman or about 70 miles northwest of downtown 
los angeles said robert finn a spokesman for the california 
institute of technology in pasadena 
state department of water resources officials in sacramento said 
crews worked overnight to reopen the aqueduct and that the city 
should not face a water shortage 
for la theres no problem the storage lakes have an ample 
water supply said mike mcgregor a spokesman for the state 
department of water resources he said the aqueduct would remain 
closed at least through today 
but he said the antelope valleyeast kern water district about 
50 miles north of downtown los angeles was asked to conserve 
because it had a smaller supply 
the quake catapulted rocks onto the northbound lanes of 
interstate 5 near the grapevine but traffic continued to flow 
while crews removed the rocks said california highway patrol 
officer jerry berger at the fort tejon station there were no 
immediate reports of accidents from the rockslide he said 
it was a real violent jolt berger said 
a series of aftershocks also were measured by caltech with the 
biggest measuring 40 on the richter scale at 422 pm said riley 
geary a seismic analyst 
the garlock fault where the quake struck is the secondlargest 
fault in california with a length of 200 miles compared with the 
600milelong san andreas fault said us geological survey 
seismologist lucile jones 
the richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

the army ordered a speedup in the judicial 
review process for some of the 5000 palestinian arrested during 
the arab uprising in the occupied territories defense officials 
said the new system would benefit detainees by increasing judicial 
supervision 
but palestinian lawyer jonathan kuttab today called the move a 
charade and said defense minister yitzhak rabin ordered the changes 
after all detainees decided last week to challenge the system by 
filing appeals 
about 2000 arabs are being held for up to six months without 
charges most of them taken into custody since the uprising began 
dec 8 they are called administrative detainees the army also 
holds about 3000 arabs awaiting trial or serving prison terms on 
charges of antiisraeli violence 
underground leaders of the uprising set aside today as a day 
of solidarity with palestinian prisoners and called for renewed 
antiisraeli protests 
on friday soldiers bulldozed the cinderblock house of an arab 
from the west bank refugee camp jelazoun after he was arrested on 
suspicion that he stabbed an israeliappointed arab mayor 
in the west bank village of beita troops expelled about 100 
israelis who were planting olive trees to protest the armys 
uprooting of orchards and demolition of 14 arab houses 
the army measures were in reprisal for an april 6 clash between 
villagers and israeli teenage west bank settlers in which two 
arabs and a 15yearold jewish girl were killed 
also friday the government press office reinstated the press 
credentials of nbc television correspondend martin fletcher after a 
sixweek suspension imposed because he allegedly violated military 
censorship 
kuttab said the changes in the appeals process were ordered 
because under the current system the army would be unable to deal 
with the expected wave of appeals 
within the next two weeks all detainees will have filed 
appeals kuttab told the associated press this is going to 
impose a heavy burden on the system 
under present rules a threemember military committee hears the 
appeals and then refers the case to the area commander for a final 
decision 
rabin on friday ordered a military judge to take the place of 
the review committee and make the final ruling in the case said 
ministry spokesman eitan haber 
haber said the new system would benefit the detainees by 
speeding up the appeals process israel radio quoted military 
officials as saying rabin also ordered the changes to increase 
judicial supervision over administrative detention cases 
several weeks into the uprising the army scrapped a major legal 
safeguard for the detainees which required that they appear before 
a judge within four days after their arrest 
in jelazoun the army demolished the home of 26yearold khamis 
jawdat faraj arrested thursday on charges he knifed mayor hassan 
tawil 74 of the west bank town el bireh as an act of palestinian 
nationalism 
israel radio said faraj confessed to stabbing tawil who was 
recovering at a jerusalem hospital 
it took about 30 minutes for a big yellow bulldozer to level the 
threeroom house where faraj lived with his 60yearold mother an 
almond tree a plum tree and a rose bush were left standing in the 
yard 
the army said faraj was detained several times previously for 
alleged participation in antiisraeli disturbances 
the treeplanting ceremony in beita was organized by the 
committee for beita a group trying to force authorities to 
make reparations to villagers whose homes were destroyed or damaged 
by the army as punishment 
jewish settlers and the army initially blamed the villagers for 
the death of israeli tirza porat in the april clash but an army 
report later determined she was accidentally killed by a bullet 
fired by an israeli guarding the group

the death toll in a soviet train explosion neared 
100 as workers picked through rubble in the city of arzamas a 
newspaper said today blaming the blast on the improper transport 
of industrial explosives 
the force of the explosion made it difficult to determine 
exactly how many died the communist party newspaper pravda 
reported saying the toll was approaching 100 it added that 
200 people were hospitalized and 700 familes left homeless in the 
industrial city 240 miles east of moscow 
shortly after the explosion a week ago today the staterun 
media put the death toll at 73 it rose to 80 on wednesday more 
are missing and unaccounted for pravda said 
the explosion caused millions of dollars in damages pravda 
said without giving a specific figure 
investigators have not yet determined what sparked the blast 
but it apparently stemmed from improper loading and handling of 
explosives 
it was clear the crew did not know what they were carrying 
wrote pravda correspondent v lisin 
the cargo list on the train listed one type of explosive but 
in the wagons themselves was another more dangerous substance 
worse than that two types of explosives were placed together in 
the first wagon which is categorically forbidden it said 
examination of wagons which did not blow up pravda said 
revealed severe violations of the rules for the transportation of 
dangerous cargos 
detailed reports of disasters were unheard of before kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev came to power in march 1985 and began 
the policy of glasnost or greater discussion of some formerly 
taboo subjects

attacked the foreign ministry and the prime ministers office 
today and student leaders vowed to stage another march to north 
korea for unification talks 
police said 26 students forced their way past guards at a back 
gate of the combined central government building in downtown seoul 
and hurled at least 10 firebombs at the complex eight of the 
attackers barricaded themselves in a thirdfloor cafeteria before 
they were seized by police 
nobody was injured in the attack in which windows were smashed 
and a police guard post and a waiting room blackened by flames and 
smoke police said they arrested 18 attackers and that the others 
fled

government departments 
small clashes also were reported today in the provincial cities 
of taeju and kwangju as riot police firing volleys of tear gas 
dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs no injuries or 
arrests were immediately reported 
the attacks were mounted after riot police blocked thousands of 
radical students on friday from mounting a march to the north 
korean border for talks on reuniting the divided korean peninsula 
fighting began on friday when police fired tear gas to drive back 
students who hurled firebombs and battled with rocks and clubs to 
try and break through to the border 
police officials said today that more than 800 students were 
arrested in the clashes the day before more than 100 police and 
students were injured in the street clashes they said 
about 60000 riot police were deployed to halt the march to the

college students have failed to attract popular support with their 
reunification campaign the main opposition parties urged radicals 
to abandon the march saying it lacked public support

determined to conquer the south north korea invaded the south in 
1950 to start the korean war and the two nations remain bitter

a loyal progovernment 
newspaper today joined the outcry against new press restrictions 
and a prominent black moderate pleaded for the release of jailed 
guerrilla leader nelson mandela 
the new restrictions took effect friday when the government 
reimposed the nationwide state of emergency for a third year they 
tighten curbs on reporting about opposition activity and require 
some journalists to register with the government 
the citizen a progovernment johannesburg daily joined a wide 
range of journalists antiapartheid leaders and others in 
criticizing the restrictions 
there is only one word for the new press curbs and that is 
overkill the citizens editorial said 
it said the government appeared to have reached the point where 
it was barring newspapers from reporting matters of vital concern 
to everyone it added that will mean the public will be 
uninformed and subject to rumor 
the foreign correspondents association said in a statement we 
observe with irony that south africa is progressively shutting down 
the free flow of information at a time when the soviet union 
frequently depicted here as an enemy of press freedom is 
noticeably moving towards a more open society 
mangosuthu buthelezi leader of the kwazulu homeland and one of 
the blacks the government would like to draw into a 
whitecontrolled powersharing arrangement said the extension of 
the emergency was a tragedy 
at an outdoor meeting near durban buthelezi also appealed for 
the release of mandela who is serving a life prison sentence for 
his actions as leader of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement 
black south africa will not rest until he is free buthelezi 
said nothing the south african government can do will gain it 
credibility while it treats dr mandela as a dangerous enemy 
buthelezi said mandela might be the only person capable of 
ending a bloody power stuggle in natal province between militants 
who support the anc and more conservative blacks who follow 
buthelezi 
i believe he mandela would come out of jail to thump anybody 
who set black brother against black brother on the eve of a 
final black victory over apartheid buthelezi said 
as he spoke about 70000 fans packed londons wembley stadium 
for a 10hour rock concert honoring mandela 
although the british broadcasting corp pledged to cover the 
extravaganza as a musical not a political event its commentator 
referred to mandela as a political prisoner the south african 
government threatened this week to expel the bbc for its allegedly 
biased coverage of the government 
one of the new restrictions imposed in south africa on friday 
outlaws advocacy of a boycott of nationwide municipal elections 
scheduled for october 
most major antiapartheid groups including 17 which were banned 
in february oppose black participation in elections organized by 
the white authorities until blacks have voting rights on a national 
level 
the new regulations make it illegal to quote antigovernment 
statements from members of the 17 organizations and prohibit 
newspapers from quoting any anc members 
another new rule requires local news agencies except for the 
south african press association to register with the government 
these small domestic news agencies many of them aggressive in 
covering antiapartheid activity could be ordered to submit their 
dispatches to a government censor 
a group of these alternative news agencies the east cape news 
agencies said the new regulation could be the first step on the 
road to compulsory registration of all journalists with the 
threat of deregistration if they misbehave 
the government seeks a nation of ignorant pliant subjects

the citys jail population dropped below the 
courtordered limit allowing the city to hold prisoners unable to 
raise bail officials said 
the jail population this morning was 3813 under the 3850 
maximum permitted by the court on weekends and holidays bail 
commissioner charles murray said for other days the maximum 
prison population is set at 3750 
since wednesday many people including alleged drug dealers had 
avoided jail when unable to raise bail because of the order by us 
district judge norma shapiro that limited the citys prison 
population 
at the time the jails held nearly 4000 men and women 
the city began freeing prisoners on their own recognizance if 
they were awaiting trial and had been unable to raise bail of 
2500 or less 
on friday afternoon prison superintendent edmund lyons said the 
jails held 3690 people and that starting this morning those 
unable to raise bail would be held 
the prison is open and people can be admitted on a regular 
basis murray said early today the moratorium right now is 
lifted 
district attorney ronald castille has termed the jail moratorium 
lunacy charging that city prisons can hold as many as 4300 
inmates 
castille called on mayor w wilson goode to seek to have the cap 
raised or find alternate confinement space 
prisoners who brought the lawsuit charged that philadelphias 
prisons were overcrowded they had demanded that each of the citys 
3200 cells should have only one person 
excluded from the moratorium are those charged with murder 
attempted murder rape attempted rape kidnapping arson robbery 
and aggravated assault in addition to crimes involving use of a gun 
or knife or large amounts of drugs 
meanwhile the city moved closer to increasing its cell space by 
awarding a construction contract for a new 165 million criminal 
justice center the center with jail space for 440 people plus 
courtrooms is expected to be completed in 1991

vitus cathedral today for the consecration of two assistant 
bishops the first such roman catholic appointments allowed by the 
communist government since 1973 
after the ceremony hundreds of people shouted slogans such as 
long live father cardinal long live the pope and we 
want religious freedom outside the palace of cardinal frantisek 
tomasek

officiated at a twohour ceremony to mark the formal appointment of 
jan lebeda the 75yearold vicar general of prague and 
64yearold priest antonin liska as assistant bishops of prague 
their appointment should lighten the workload of the 88yearold 
cardinal 
papal emissary francesco colasuonno and catholic officials from 
neighboring poland west and east germany austria and hungary were 
among those attending the majestic ritual in the cathedral 
colasuonno later shook hands with those who rallied outside 
tomaseks palace

freedom have taken place almost every sunday after mass around the 
cathedral and tomaseks palace

to fill any of the 10 vacant sees in czechoslovakia where the 
authorities have not approved any new bishops since 1973 lebeda 
and liska are the first new assistant bishops since 1973 
tomasek has come under attack from staterun media in recent 
months for supporting a petition for more religious freedom that 
has garnered an estimated 600000 signatures 
in april the cardinal wrote to premier lubomir strougal urging 
that the church and the authorities open a new dialogue the offer

entertainer harry belafonte a veteran 
antiapartheid campaigner today kicked off a 10hour rock concert 
honoring nelson mandela by calling on south africa to release the 
black leader from prison 
belafonte speaking to 70000 fans at londons wembley stadium 
gave a brief but stirring message to mandela on his upcoming 70th 
birthday 
belafonte called mandela a symbol of south africas cruel and 
unjust system of apartheid and said we want to see you and 
your fellow political prisoners freed cheers and a chorus of 
happy birthday rose from the mostly youthful throng 
the british rock star sting then began the peformance which 
organizers said would be seen on television by 750 million people 
in 60 countries 
although the british broadcasting corp pledged to cover the 
extravaganza as a musical not a political event its commentator 
referred to mandela as a political prisoner the south african 
government threatened this week to expel the bbc for its allegedly 
biased coverage of the government 
organizers said the concert modeled on the 1985 live aid 
global jukebox for african famine relief launches a fiveweek 
series of rallies and celebrations in britain leading up to 
mandelas 70th birthday on july 18 
mandela leader of the outlawed african national congress was 
among eight anc leaders sentenced to life imprisonment 24 years ago 
today for sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government he has 
since become south africas most prominent political prisoner 
about 40 pop stars and groups including whitney houston and 
phil collins were to perform on a huge stage at the north london 
stadium 
the antiapartheid movement organizers say half the proceeds 
from the 45 tickets will go to seven childrens charities in 
southern africa and the rest will fund its activities in britain 
six hours of the concert was to be telecast in the united states 
today by fox broadcasting the los angelesbased network 
the concert has been denounced by the south african government 
and by rightwingers in britain who claim that by televising it 
the bbc is violating its duty to be impartial 
a bbc statement said the bbc is not paying for broadcast rights 
and views the concert purely as an outstanding international 
musical event 
published reports said that when a message from mandela smuggled 
out of pollsmoor prison in cape town is read to the crowd cameras 
would cut from the stage to interviews 
in london 25 lawmakers in the governing conservative party 
signed a house of commons motion saying the bbc was violating its 
rules by giving publicity to a movement that encourages the 
african national congress in its terrorist activities 
you can only say it is a political event because he mandela 
is a political prisoner countered archbishop trevor huddleston 
the main organizer of the show 
south africa said its london embassy complained to the bbc at 
the highest level about broadcasting the concert and hinted it 
might expel bbc reporters 
that complaint follows one on thursday by south african law and 
order minister adriaan vlok who said the bbc might be ordered out 
of south africa because of a film it broadcast in britain this week 
about detained black children in south africa 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
anc president oliver tambo is billed as the concerts guest of 
honor the anc is the main guerrilla group fighting south africas 
government 
scheduled performers include george michael miriam makeba hugh 
masekela dire straits eurythmics simple minds roberta flack 
natalie cole the bee gees joe cocker fat boys ashford and 
simpson joan armatrading bryan adams paul young jackson browne 
al green and jerry dammers 
there were to be several bigname surprise singers raising a 
rash of speculation in londons tabloid newspapers the sun chose 
guitaristsinger eric clapton as the secret special guest while 
the star tipped michael jackson to veer from his european tour 
among the hosts were singer meatloaf comedienne whoopi 
goldberg actresses jennifer beals darryl hannah and ali mcgraw 
and film maker sir richard attenborough

in a victory for antiabortion groups 
presbyterian leaders have urged a change in the denominations 
prochoice position while others struggled with a major church 
statement on nuclear weapons 
a subcommittee today continued revising christian obedience in 
a nuclear age a paper that has been criticized by groups within 
the presbyterian church usa who say it improperly glorifies 
civil disobedience and resistance to government policies 
abortion and nuclear weapons were among the controversial issues 
being debated during the nineday meeting of the 3millionmember 
churchs 200th general assembly which ends wednesday 
on friday full committees of the assembly adopted a 
wideranging statement on religious freedom including 
recommendations that pastors give up their tax exemptions for their 
housing allowances and adopted a paper titled is christ 
divided which complains that special interest groups have split 
the denomination and calls for more serious theological discussion 
of issues 
a committee friday called for a change in the churchs position 
on abortion and a new study of the issue but supporters of the 
denominations generally prochoice position say they expect a 
floor fight on the question the assembly is scheduled to consider 
the matter on tuesday 
presbyterians prolife a sanctioned organization within the 
denomination wants the church to condemn abortion in all instances 
except where the mothers life is in danger 
ppl cosponsored an appearance by nobel peace laureate mother 
teresa in a rally before the convention began tuesday ppl hoped 
mother teresas reputation and staunch antiabortion stance would 
persuade commissioners to approve a new study or a change in 
church policy 
currently the presbyterian group opposes abortion as a method 
of birth control but says the decision rests with a woman in 
consultation with her doctor and her conscience 
also friday the 18member christian obedience subcommittee 
retained language in the christian obedience paper that calls 
nuclear war immoral but changed a section labeling the theory of 
nuclear deterrence immoral 
t lafontine fountain odom an elder from charlotte nc 
said the subcommittee revised the paper to say nuclear deterrence 
as an end in itself is immoral 
in addition the subcommittee deleted recommendations calling on 
local church groups to provide financial and moral support to those 
who resist the government through tax protest and civil 
disobedience 
but the subcommittee left in recommendations calling for 
creation of a voluntary fund for obedience to a high authority 
for the assistance of those who suffer financial loss or 
difficulty as a result of acts of conscience 
many conservatives have blamed the christian obedience paper and 
past social policy statements for the denominations membership 
decline 
there were 2976937 church members in 1987 a decline of 
154191 since 1983 when the denomination was formed from two 
presbyterian groups that had split during the civil war the 
denomination is almost 14 times larger than the secondlargest 
group the presbyterian church in america

a teamsters union official says 
mandatory drug testing of interstate truck and bus drivers is 
unreasonable and resembles a politically motivated witch hunt 
by federal highway safety officials 
the international brotherhood of teamsters will fight this all 
the way said rv durham the unions safety and health 
director the teamsters represent 200000 truckers nationwide 
durham responded friday to a highway safety proposal by 
secretary of transportation jim burnley for drug testing of up to 5 
million drivers of interstate trucks passenger buses and vehicles 
hauling hazardous materials 
we must act to identify those commercial drivers who abuse 
drugs and get them off the roads burnley told a news conference 
here when one drugged truck or bus driver goes out on the road 
he not only puts the lives of many people in danger he gives the 
entire work force a bad reputation 
but durham said teamster drivers are the safest and most 
responsible in the trucking industry and called the dot proposal a 
witch hunt and a politically motivated move to beat up on 
truck drivers 
durham said that teamster truckers were already subject to drug 
testing as part of their biannual transportation department 
physical exams and also if there was probable suspicion of 
substance abuse 
random testing is an unreasonable and unjustifiable violation 
of a persons right to privacy we believe governmentmandated 
random testing is unconstitutional durham said 
burnleys proposal was the latest in a series of department 
efforts to make americas transportation network safer 
in march the drug testing program was proposed for the aviation 
industry in may the railroad industry was targeted 
there are no firm statistics to indicate how many of the 
nations truck drivers are drug abusers he said but he cited a 
june 1987 test of 317 tractortrailer drivers in tennessee that 
showed 15 percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana 
cocaine and prescription stimulants 
the proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million people who 
drive commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10000 pounds 
vehicles that transport 16 or more people or vehicles that 
transport hazardous materials 
school bus drivers and intercity bus drivers would not be 
affected by the proposal he said 
in washington the american trucking association endorsed the 
effort but expressed concerns about how the tests would be 
implemented

a group trying to take a convoy of 
truckloads of aid to nicaragua has again been stalled at the border 
in a dispute with the trreasury department over trade restrictions 
on the central american nation 
they have gone back on what they said said david silk a 
spokesman for veterans peace convoy we are back to square one 
the group already is three days behind schedule 
us customs officials met late friday with representatives of 
the group 
last night they told us we would be forced to sign a statement 
of intent stating essentially that we the convoy are wrong we are 
guilty of breaking the embargo law sean guillete a convoy 
participant said early today our lawyers are not at all happy 
with this proposal 
donna de la torre a us customs worker in houton told ktsa 
radio in san antonio the meeting was held to pass out papers to be 
signed and go over guidelines 
about 100 convoy members have been camped here since wednesday 
when treasury department officials informed them that the trip 
would violate trade restrictions imposed on nicaragua in 1985 
violation of the regulations can result in fines of up to 50000 
and prison terms up to 10 years 
some 30 tons of food clothing and medical supplies would be 
allowed for humanitarian purposes the government told the convoy 
members but their 37 vehicles could not be left in nicaragua 
treasurys office of foreign assets control said the group would 
have to apply for an export license post cash bonds equal to the 
value of the trucks cars and buses and give assurance the 
vehicles would be returned to this country within 30 days 
on friday customs officials told the group they would not seize 
their trucks if bonds were not posted 
however a treasury spokesman in washington said friday 
afternoon that foreign assets control had not changed its position 
organizer gerry condon said the group planned to leave vehicles 
in nicaragua but never intended to be out of compliance with the 
law 
the convoy began may 21 from different regions of the united 
states and arrived in laredo on tuesday 
we have baby food going bad in the 115degree temperature down 
here silk said we are angry tired of being toyed with 
gullette said the group will do everything to avoid violence 
but at the same time the convoy believes in civil disobedience when 
appropriate 
convoy members say they are being harassed because of their 
opposition to us aid for the rebels fighting the leftist 
sandinista government treasury officials say they are simply 
following standard procedures

former soldiers loyal to deposed 
president ferdinand marcos ransacked a military armory today but 
failed to free soldiers jailed for involvement in past coup 
attempts the military said 
also today the military said it filed murder and kidnapping 
charges against a swede a west german and a filipino of german 
descent who were accused of taking part in a rebel raid in february 
maj gen ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary 
said the former soldiers fled with 24 stolen m16 rifles when 
guards fired at them as they tried to free some of the 160 people 
mostly soldiers detained at suburban camp crame 
he said his troops were ready for the attempted rescue of the 
prisoners because of intelligence reports earlier that marcos 
loyalists would try to rescue orlando dulay a former assemblyman 
close to the former president and other detainees 
dulay has been jailed for more than a year on charges of 
masterminding the killing of several followers of president corazon 
aquino during the campaign for the february 1986 presidential 
election mrs aquino was swept into power and marcos was deposed 
during the campaign 
the military meanwhile said charges were filed in a quezon 
civil court friday against the rev klaus schmidt 52 a west 
german protestant minister stellan hermansson 30 a swede who 
claims to be a freelance journalist and antonio bosch a filipino 
businessman of german descent 
the three arrested wednesday were accused of taking part in a 
raid by communist new peoples army guerrillas on a town southeast 
of manila in february in which two people were killed and two 
soldiers abducted 
montano linked participants in todays raid on camp crame to 
reynaldo cabauatan a promarcos former major involved in a failed 
coup attempt in january 1987 montano based the conclusion on the 
attire of the raiders who wore black hoods fatigue pants black 
tshirts with black forest commando insignias and red arm bands 
military units were placed on alert throughout the nation today 
but officials said the move was not related to the camp crame 
incident they said it was a routine measure to prevent any 
disruption of celebrations on sunday the 90th anniversary of the 
declaration of philippine independence from spain 
constabulary spokesman lt col cris maralit said the camp crame 
raid began at 4 am with the renegades riding in a white van and a 
car that apparently were parked inside the camp the day before 
it was not clear whether the raiders stayed overnight inside the 
camp the constabularys national headquarters maralit said most 
likely they slipped in one by one during the night 
he said the renegades first ransacked the armory of the 
constabularys brass band and proceeded to the jail compound where 
they were spotted by sentries who fired on them 
the renegades immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brief 
firefight by soldiers near the camps gym maralit said 
he said an undetermined number of renegades were believed hit in 
the exchange there were no casualties on the government side 
maralit said one soldier stationed at the raided armory was 
being questioned for possible links to the raiders 
at least 34 detainees at camp crame are accused of involvement 
in at least five coup attempts against mrs aquinos government 
soldiers linked with cabauatan who remains at large since the 
jan 27 1987 failed coup also attempted to free soldiers jailed 
at suburban fort bonifacio the philippine army headquarters in 
april 1987 
one of the renegades was killed in the incident and the others 
surrendered after an eighthour siege at least 17 inmates also 
facing coup charges escaped but eventually surrendered or were 
recaptured

highway patrol and sheriffs officers 
today searched for dozens of children who fled a baptist boarding 
home after a judge granted the state temporary custody following 
allegations of mental and physical abuse 
about 80 of approximately 140 children living at the bethel home 
for children in lucedale remained at large police said late friday 
state officials said they would work over the weekend trying to 
reach the childrens parents and guardians 
youth court judge robert oswald of pascagoula issued the order 
at 11 am friday saying there was probable cause to suspect 
physical and mental abuse at the home minutes after he issued the 
order welfare department personnel arrived at the home but in the 
meantime the youths apparently were alerted and most had fled 
we were told they were allowed if not encouraged to leave 
the campus and some of the children said they were told to run 
said state welfare commissioner thomas brittain 
some of the children ages 8 through 17 were found in private 
homes restaurants and walking along the streets of lucedale 
brittain said 
about 60 children were taken to dormitories on the campus of the 
mississippi state hospital at whitfield he said they were 
undergoing physical examinations 
after the decision was made to house the children at the 
hospital parents began calling the hospital state hospital 
spokeswoman wynona winfield said welfare department social 
workers she said told parents how to get to the hospital how the 
children were and answered other questions 
many of the youths were angry as they were taken into custody 
you have no right i want to be here with my people said 
eric parker 16 i dont want to be here with all the rest of you 
people who hate the truth you better check yourself and make sure 
you are not burning on the way to hell 
officials were unsure how many children lived at the home 
because its operator the rev herman fountain refused to provide 
a list of residents brittain said 
fountain along with several other ministers from the 
fundamentalist church who flocked from louisiana georgia and texas 
to support him claim such boarding homes are protected from state 
regulation because of the constitutional separation of church and 
state 
oswald issued the order following a weeklong hearing on a 
request by george county authorities the hearing stemmed from an 
investigation into a child who ran away from the home and refused 
to return claiming he was physically abused 
in court papers the youth identified only by his initials 
said he was tired of being locked up slapped and getting licks 
all the time he told social workers he was denied medical and 
dental treatment during his 19month stay at the bethel home 
authorities have not charged anyone at the home with abuse but 
are still investigating the allegations brittain said telephone 
calls to the bethel home were not answered late friday 
the judge ruled that according to mississippis youth act the 
children were being held in a detention home rather than a boarding 
home detention facilities are required to notify the state of 
children placed in their custody 
fountain was jailed for two days for refusing provide a list of 
residents but he was freed friday without turning over the roster 
after agreeing to an orderly transfer of the children to state 
custody 
when welfare department officials arrived fountain was already 
at the home brittain said 
we did not encounter any cooperation from him there in fact 
it was just the opposite brittain said declining to elaborate 
brittain said he was unsure whether any action would be taken 
against fountain 
the court order gives the state 48hour temporary custody of the 
children in addition to custody today and sunday welfare 
officials hope to locate and return the children to their parents 
brittain said 
we have information that some folks are trying to help the 
kids escape out of state he said 
based on his experience with the bethesda home for girls near 
hattiesburg where about 100 children were taken into state custody 
in 1986 brittain said he believed the childrens parents would be 
scattered throughout the country

the early version of a star wars antimissile 
defense cant be deployed until at least 1998 and even then would 
cost more and offer less protection than the administration admits 
a democratic report issued by three senators said saturday 
president reagan has been pushing for development of a phase 
one version of the program but it is not going to get off the 
ground either militarily or fiscally the 110page report said 
the report was written by the majority staff of the senate 
appropriations committee and was released by three members of the 
panel sens bennett johnston of louisiana dale bumpers of 
arkansas and william proxmire of wisconsin 
it was the second major criticism in the past five days from 
capitol hill of reagans strategic defense initiative as star wars 
is formally known 
last tuesday the office of technology assessment an arm of 
congress said the highly sophisticated computer software needed 
for star wars might fail the ota report also said an american star 
wars defense could easily be thwarted by the soviets and would 
likely set off a new ussoviet space arms race 
the senators criticism focused on sdis socalled phase one 
which involves construction of an early version of the system star 
wars researchers are looking at a variety of exotic technologies 
including lasers to use as a missile defense but phase one 
envisions using existing groundbased rockets and orbiting 
garages of spacebased rockets to fire at attacking soviet 
nuclear weapons 
the pentagon told congress last year that deployment of a phase 
one system could begin by the mid1990s and would cost between 75 
billion to 150 billion 
but the senators report disputed those estimates a 
significant phase one deployment cannot occur before 1998 at the 
earliest with a full operational capability after the turn of the 
century it said costs could be as high as 171 billion and 
could approach 750 billion when combined with a later phase two 
program it said 
in addition the senate report said a phase one system would 
intercept less than 16 percent of the expected soviet nuclear 
warheads 
the senators noted that ongoing ussoviet nuclear arms control 
talks are aimed at reducing each superpowers arsenal of longrange 
weapons by 50 percent 
the strategic defense initiative organization said the senate 
report contains more misleading assertions than facts 
it specifically disputed the estimate that only 16 percent of 
expected soviet warheads could be intercepted the sdi office said 
the military estimates while classified are considerably 
greater than 16 percent 
of the 1998 target date the sdi rebuttal said congressional 
cuts to the sdi budget have slowed our progress we are working 
within congressional budget constraints to achieve the means for 
effective strategic defenses at the earliest possible moment 
the senators report agreed with the ota assessment that the 
soviets could easily counter the us shield 
the phase one system likely would be obsolete the day it is 
deployed the report said technical challenges and the 
evolving soviet threat will severely degrade its effectiveness 
the pentagon is underestimating soviet political and military 
resolve to counter the us defense and overestimating the 
difficulty of soviet countermeasures the senate document said 
the report called for overhauling the sdi program to emphasize 
research into promising new technologies rather than development 
of existing systems 
it noted that while the presidents vision of sdi would 
substitute strategic defenses for nuclear deterrence sdio has yet 
to describe any system phase one or otherwise that would effect 
such a substitution phase one would only reinforce nuclear 
deterrence 
it also suggested that unless congress is prepared to 
substantially incrase funding every year for sdi there will not be 
enough resources to carry out a phase one research program while 
simultaneously funding an energetic effort for promising new 
technologies 
the house and senate are now trying to decide how much to spend 
for star wars in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the current star 
wars budget is 39 billion 
reagan sought 48 billion but the senate voted 46 billion 
while the house approved 35 billion a housesenate conference 
committee will decide a compromise figure

democrat michael dukakis is off to a strong 
start in california and other longtime republican strongholds in 
his race against vice president george bush although a closely 
contested presidential election seemed likely according to an 
associated press survey 
the 50state survey indicated widespread optimism among 
democrats that dukakis can end eight years of republican rule in 
the white house gop officials in many states said the contest 
shapes up as a tight one but several said bush could win easily if 
he succeeds in his attempt to depict dukakis as an heir to the 
democratic partys liberal past 
dukakis leads in the polls in california and new jersey which 
last voted democratic in 1964 and is running even with bush in the 
polls in utah which gave president reagan his largest majorities 
in 1980 and 1984 one survey shows him running even in reliably 
republican nebraska and within striking distance in texas and 
florida key southern states 
i think it will be the closest presidential contest weve had 
since 1976 said tom cole the gop state chairman in oklahoma 
oklahoma hasnt voted for a democrat in a presidential campaign 
since 1964 but cole said we dont have a candidate with ronald 
reagans unique popularity thats not to knock george bush nobody 
else has got that kind of popularity either 
said democratic chairwoman karen marchioro of washington state 
this is the best shot weve had in a long long time the last 
time a democrat carried her state in a presidential election was 
1968 
republicans have won four of the last five presidential 
elections with jimmy carters victory in 1976 the only exception 
while dukakis leads in nationwide puiblic opinion polls there 
is agreement that political fortunes in the five months until the 
election will be influenced by factors such as selection of a vice 
presidential running mate campaign debates and the health of the 
economy 
republicans believe that dukakis lead is a temporary result of 
favorable publicity over the past several weeks generated by his 
string of primary victories against jesse jackson 
nobody has laid a glove on dukakis and he hasnt been burdened 
with the traditional baggage a northern liberal carries with him 
says south carolina gop party director tom denny thats going to 
change once the conventions are over we havent been able to start 
hitting on him 
for now dukakis doubledigit lead nationally is reflected in 
poll results around the country and optimism among democratic 
officials in states from washington and oregon to new hampshire 
he leads bush by a doubledigit margin in polls in california 
he is also viewed as the leader in both washington which last went 
democratic in 1968 and oregon which last voted that way in 1964 
polls in utah and nebraska indicate the two men are running 
even neither state has backed a democrat in a presidential race 
since 1964 and gop officials in both states express confidence 
that wont change this time 
bush holds leads in polls in texas and florida but dukakis is 
well within striking distance and officials in both parties say the 
race could be influenced by vice presidential running mates bush 
is perceived as running generally well across the south 
i sense a strong base of support for vice president bush in 
the south says steve french political director of the alabama 
republican party but republicans in alabama realize how close 
this election can be 
officials of both parties agree that the vice president also has 
to contend with weaknesses in the midwest that were exposed during 
the primary season 
if the election were held today i think michael dukakis would 
stand a good chance of winning iowa where a democrat last won in 
1964 said the states gop chairman michael mahaffey 
as is often the case the large industrial states illinois 
michigan ohio among them are viewed as key battleground states 
although dukakis seems to hold the early advantage in each of them 
no matter what the polls show californias 47 electoral college 
votes make it certain to be the biggest battleground of all 
most officials believe dukakis holds an advantage in new york 
the second largest state with 36 electoral votes in pennsylvania 
gop chairman earl baker said dukakis is the strongest democratic 
candidate to run in the state dukakiss base also gives him a 
good shot at connecticut as well as massachusetts and rhode island 
and democratic officials say the three northern new england states 
shape up as closer than usual 
no matter what the polls look like this is going to be a close 
election because the vice president has an advantage in the 
electoral college says lee atwater bushs campaign manager he 
says that in states in the south and west there are 210 or 220 
electoral college votes easily available for the vice president 
the problem is the other 50 are going to be difficult 
leslie dach dukakis communications director says the democrat 
intends to stage raids in normally secure republican territory 
we can win electoral votes in every region of the country he 
says 
it takes 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency 
the race could be heavily influenced by the vice presidential 
selections 
the ap survey which relied on polls and contacts with party 
leaders or independent political analysts in all 50 states turned 
up little enthusiasm for jesse jackson on the democratic ticket in 
keeping with polls that indicate that such a pick would lose 
support 
but dukakis received plenty of advice to look to a southerner 
such as sen sam nunn of georgia a westerner or perhaps ohio sen 
john glenn to fill out his ticket 
if dukakis doesnt pick a southerner it just makes it that 
more difficult for us said texas democratic chairman bob slagle 
on the republican side the name of california gov george 
deukmejian came up frequently as talk turned to holding his state 
in the gop column former tennessee gov lamar alexander also was 
mentioned by several as a good southern choice 
whatever the preferences the polls indicate the importance of a 
vice presidential selection 
a survey in texas gives bush a margin of 48 percent to 41 
percent over dukakis but if texas democratic sen lloyd bentsen 
were to join the ticket the survey shows the race would narrow to 
essentially even 
similarly a recent poll in california gives dukakis a lead of 
53 percent to 40 percent over bush but the vice president would 
fare far better if deukmejian joins the ticket

a federal agency seeking to make highlevel 
government service more attractive is recommending some officials 
be permitted to postpone taxes on profits resulting from property 
sold to avoid a conflict of interest with their public duties 
the administrative conference of the united states meeting 
thursday and friday proposed the deferral of tax liability in 
cases where the incoming official reinvests the proceeds of the 
sale in mutual funds congress would have to change the tax laws to 
permit this 
the conference a permanent independent agency established by 
congress to improve the working of federal agencies proposed that 
the tax postponement be available only in cases specifically 
requested by the president 
under current law officials who are forced to sell off property 
because they might present conflicts of interest must pay any 
capital gains taxes during the year of the sale 
you shouldnt have a tax penalty to become a public servant 
said fred j fielding a former reagan white house counsel who 
chairs the conferences special committee on ethics in government 
the conference also recommended that president reagan sign an 
executive order that later this year would require members of the 
incoming presidents transition team to agree in writing to a code 
of conduct 
during the 19801981 presidential transition over 600 persons 
most serving as volunteers had active assignments on agency 
transition teams the group said 
while it has no knowledge of any abuse the group said so many 
people dealing with federal agencies offers the potential for 
conflicts of interest or abuse of the public trust that accompanies 
their special access to government information and facilities 
the proposed conduct code for transition employees most of whom 
are not paid and do not join the government would prohibit them 
from using disclosing or permitting others to use for private gain 
any information they obtained in their temporary roles

the catastrophiccare bill awaiting president 
reagans signature will mean the biggest expansion of a federal 
health program in a quarter century but carries a lesswelcome 
surprise for millions of elderly americans a big income tax 
increase 
for many medicare recipients the increase would more than wipe 
out the gain won when the tax system was overhauled in 1986 
the tax increase would kick in for 1989 income for anyone who is 
eligible for medicare it would start by adding 15 percent to 
regular tax next year jump to 25 percent in 1990 and then rise by 
as much as one percentage point a year thereafter conceivably 
reaching 35 percent by the end of the century 
this tax increase would pay for about twothirds of the cost of 
protecting medicare recipients against catastrophic hospital 
physician and drug expenses the program would cost an estimated 
33 billion over the next five years alone the remainder of the 
cost would be covered by raising the monthly part b premium paid by 
recipients for doctors services 
thus those who benefit from the expanded program would pay the 
entire cost at least for the near future we have not asked our 
children to pay the medical bills that we incur said rep jj 
pickle dtexas these benefits will be paid for by the men and 
women who will use the coverage 
but even some members of congress who voted for the bill worried 
aloud that as the tax burden on the elderly grows pressure will 
mount to have other taxpayers share the cost 
the compromise bill cleared by congress last week is 
considerably more generous than the version recommended by reagan 
nevertheless there is no indication that the president will veto 
it even with the tax increase 
sponsors of the bill are reluctant to use the term tax 
increase rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house 
ways and means committee repeatedly referred to it as a new 
incomerelated premium 
negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill decided that 
paying for the expansion solely by raising the part b premium would 
have made it prohibitively expensive for lowerincome people 
the final compromise said sen bob dole rkan takes into 
consideration an individuals ability to pay for this protection 
and in doing so allows this coverage to be more affordable for 
lowincome beneficiaries 
congress estimates the average tax increase will be 285 per 
person in 1989 and 506 in 1993 
the bill includes several restrictions on how the tax would be 
applied

it would hit only those people eligible for medicare generally 
age 65 or older or disabled whose incomes are high enough that 
they already pay at least 150 income tax typically and elderly 
couple with adjusted gross income of 11000 or less would not be 
subject to the increase 
congressional staffers estimate that in 1989 about 40 percent 
of americans over the age of 65 would have to pay the tax increase 
a private organization the institute for research on the economics 
of taxation estimates 46 percent next year and 56 percent by 1993 
the maximum tax would be 800 per person in 1989 1600 for a 
couple if both spouses are eligible for medicare rising to 1050 
2100 per couple in 1993 
the tax will be at a rate of 2250 for each 150 of regular 
incometax liability in 1989 by 1993 42 per 150 of liability 
according to the institute for research a couple with 21000 
adjusted gross income and taking the standard deduction would face 
a tax increase of 236 in 1989 and 441 in 1993 at 31500 income 
the increase would be 473 next year and 882 in 1993 
on the average taxpayers with incomes between 20000 and 
30000 were given a 220 tax cut in the 1986 tax overhaul those 
between 30000 and 40000 averaged 273 
the increase in the monthly part b premium required by the bill 
would be the same regardless of income in 1989 the 2710 premium 
would rise to 3110 and by 1993 would be 4260 a month 
backers of the bill acknowledge that no more than 7 percent of 
the elderly and disabled who are eligible for medicare would 
benefit from the bill even though all will have to pay the part b 
increase and many will face the new tax 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
compared the bill to fire insurance 
not everybody is going to have a catastrophic illness and not 
everybody wants to have a fire either bentsen said but what 
you are paying is an insurance premium that takes the law of 
averages and applies it to the individual with the fervent hope 
that the vast majority never have the need to use this benefit

a ship that has been unable to unload its 
10000 tons of ash for 20 months is headed for west africa where 
public anger is rising at industrial nations trying to dump wastes 
the khian sea is en route to the cape verde islands and from 
there it will go to an undisclosed destination in west africa said 
its operator the amalgamated shipping co of freeport the bahamas 
in a june 3 letter to the environmental protection agency 
amalgamated shipping said the khian sea was proceeding under 
reduced speed to the islands west of senegal to await further 
orders 
the company said it had a representative in west africa 
negotiating for the discharge of the ash which came from city 
incinerators 
the organization of african unity has called plans by developed 
countries to dump their wastes a crime against africa and 
africans and the greenpeace environmental group said in a report 
last week that shipping waste to africa was a growing trend 
in particular africa the caribbean and latin america have 
become the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers from 
industrialized countries greenpeace said 
on thursday guinean officials announced that they had jailed a 
norwegian official and several guinean employees of the ministry of 
commerce for bringing 15000 tons of philadelphia ash into the 
country 
if the khian sea is planning to go to west africa if these 
guys are thinking of marketing their material there their timing 
is way off said peter christich an official in the epas 
international affairs office 
the khian sea left philadelphia in october 1986 loaded with 
about 15000 tons of incinerator ash it has been rejected by the 
bahamas the dominican republic honduras haiti and guineabissau 
it unloaded about 4000 tons of ash in haiti before being ordered 
out of the country 
it returned to the delaware bay on march 1 with the intention of 
taking the ash back to philadelphia but negotiations broke down 
with the contractor who was to dispose of the ash joseph paolino amp 
sons and the ship left may 22 
in march as bulkhandling inc a norwegian shipping company 
said it had taken 15000 tons of philadelphia incinerator ash to 
guinea to be used in making construction material the ash was 
dumped on the island of kassa off the guinean coast 
by may the guinean government formally requested that the ash 
be removed bulkhandling officials tried to convince the government 
that the ash was not harmful but it was not convinced and set a 
may 20 deadline to remove the ash 
the ash was not taken away and on thursday the government 
announced that norways consul general had been arrested for 
complicity in the secret dumping of what it called 15000 tons of 
toxic waste from the united states 
ibrahima sory diaby guinean secretary of state for security 
said the waste was shipped from philadelphia city officials have 
said that the ash is not harmful

george bush and michael dukakis both talk of 
eliminating the us budget deficit in four to five years but 
outside economists suggest their intentions may be better than 
their arithmetic 
analysts not aligned with either camp suggest that plans 
forwarded so far by both the republican and the democratic 
nomineestobe fall far short of pointing the way to a balanced 
budget 
its the 1988 edition of voodoo economics said economist 
michael k evans using the term coined by bush in 1980 to 
criticize ronald reagans supplyside contention that budget 
savings could flow from tax cuts 
the plans of both candidates contain as major elements features 
that private economists find dubious dukakis claim that he can 
make a major dent in the deficit by simply beefing up 
taxcollection enforcement for example or bushs contention that 
his election would cheer financial markets and drive down interest 
rates by two percentage points thus saving billions in interest 
payments on the 25 trillion national debt 
both candidates say theyll put a high priority on trimming the 
budget shortfall which was 150 billion last year and a record 
221 billion the year before bush claims he can eliminate it in 
one term dukakis generally speaks of closing the gap over five 
years 
bush who has long since shedded his reservations about reagans 
economic policies also is calling for a flexible freeze to 
keep overall federal spending from growing faster than the rate of 
inflation with an exemption for social security benefits within 
that freeze some programs would rise and others would be cut 
but bush wont say what he would cut and he hasnt been clear 
on what he would increase either beyond suggesting that education 
programs aids research and drug enforcement would get more 
attention under a bush presidency 
bush has also proposed a longrange health plan and a 
collegebond savings program which together could cost the 
government upwards of 500 million a year 
he also proposed reducing the capital gains tax to 15 percent 
from its current rate of 28 percent and disputes arguments by many 
economists that it would cost the treasury revenues 
bush also has repeated reagans long rebuffed calls for a 
constitutional balancedbudget amendment and authority to veto 
individual items in spending bills 
the vice president like reagan before him insists he would not 
raise taxes absolutely not period he says 
dukakis says he wont rule out new taxes as a possibility but 
has been vague on just how hed trim the deficit he says hed like 
to do it without new taxes 
the massachusetts governor says he hopes to reduce federal red 
ink in annual installments of about 30 billion he talks about 
hard choices on spending but like bush he wont say exactly 
which programs hed chop 
dukakis has suggested in general terms that he would cut defense 
spending to help pay for elderly care 
dukakis also hopes to trim the deficit by stricter enforcement 
of tax laws and with a program of amnesty for tax cheats which he 
suggests could save a total of 90 billion over a fiveyear period 
an amount private analysts suggest is wildly optimistic 
both candidates hopes for wiping out the deficit are based on 
rosy assumptions of continued economic growth 
while both say they will not cut automatic social security 
benefit increases both are counting on an anticipated surplus in 
the social security trust fund in the years ahead to help offset 
red ink in other areas at least on paper 
both candidates have been deliberately obscure when it comes to 
additional details particularly on spending reductions 
both of them are doing the right thing right now and that is 
keeping their mouth shut said pat choate an economist with the 
trw corp who says that neither candidate yet has made serious 
proposals to deal with the deficit 
to bring our fiscal and monetary policies into balance 
internally and with each other and with the rest of the world 
were going to have to do some tough things in 1989 and 1990 
spell those tough things taxes adds choate who says 
theres little likelihood that the budget can be brought close to 
balance without new levies 
to the degree that the presidential candidates and their aides 
get out and get into the fight over specifics every time they 
bring up a specific and get into a fight over it thats an option 
they lose its a sad reality but were better off if they dont 
say much choate said 
william dunkelberg dean of the school of business at temple 
university in philadelphia said neither candidate has yet 
presented a realistic deficitreduction plan 
there are only two ways to eliminate the deficit one is to 
cut spending two is to raise taxes those are the only two ways 
said dunkelberg 
but from a political point of view you cant get elected by 
telling people youre going to cut what they get from the 
government by 150 billion or by telling them youre going to raise 
taxes either 
any effective program of cuts must pare deeply into socalled 
entitlement programs direct government payments to individuals 
democrats in the past have championed such programs and bush 
seeking to broaden his appeal to women minority groups and 
bluecollar workers has recently been talking of giving more 
attention to social programs such as child care health care for 
the elderly education and training for dislocated workers 
dunkelberg said that of the two candidates bushs plan for a 
freeze is a somewhat more concrete proposal although not a new 
idea and probably not a concept that congress would buy besides 
he said doubts that a freeze plus inflation alone would enable 
revenues to catch up with spending 
bushs plan has an added element revealed in recent sessions 
with economic advisers this is the assumption that financial 
markets would react favorably to his spendingfreeze proposal and 
send interest rates tumbling by at least two percentage points 
such a drop in interest rates would dramatically lower what the 
government must pay in interest on the national debt payments that 
now are running at just over 200 billion a year 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group an economic 
forecasting service based in bala cynwyd pa calls this idea 
farfetched why would the market respond favorably thats 
ridiculous the market is not stupid the market knows you cant 
get to where you want to get to by taking taxes and social security 
off the table

itll be very tough times for wildlife of all kinds says 
university of california davis wildlife specialist lee fitzhugh 
virtually anything that depends upon herbaceous plants and seeds 
will suffer songbirds amphibians reptiles and some small 
mammals 
territorial disputes may increase as animals concentrate around 
dwindling water supplies in late summer and fall says fitzhugh 
jim vashro of the montana department of fish wildlife and parks 
said fish in streams and rivers are forced to move to deeper holes 
for protection 
the fish are concentrated more so the predation and food 
competition goes up he said theres a larger mortality rate 
and less oxygen as the water temperatures go up the oxygen needs 
of the fish go up and they become stressed their growth rate is 
slowed or they die 
the dry weather could mean fewer ducks for the fall hunting 
season 
gay simpson of the south dakota department of game fish and 
parks said many nesting areas have dried up although the extent of 
the problem wont be fully known until after a breeding pair survey 
and brood count are conducted 
around atlanta coyotes descendants of animals smuggled in by 
hunters have taken to raiding watermelon patches in search of 
water state wildlife officials say rats are reported invading 
yards in the san francisco bay area in search of water 
even handouts for birds could be affected 
feed prices are way up already with the dry weather said 
tom westman owner of several minnesota greenery wild bird stores 
in just the last month weve seen a 25 percent increase in our 
costs on sunflower seeds if some of these areas dont start 
getting rain then in the fall prices will continue to climb

treasury secretary james a baker iii in an 
upbeat assessment of the upcoming sevennation economic summit in 
toronto said that the world economy is in better shape now than it 
has been for any of president reagans previous seven summits 
because us officials dont want to upset financial markets in 
the midst of a presidential election campaign and because us 
allies would prefer to wait and deal with reagans successor few 
new policy initiatives are expected during the session 
in an interview late last week baker also said that he wont 
let widespread reports that hes about to leave his post to join 
george bushs republican presidential campaign distract him from 
giving his full attention to the economy 
the treasury secretary said there was no chance that any 
decision would be made in the coming week before the summit 
republican sources have said they expect baker to resign sometime 
this summer to help run bushs campaign 
the economic summit the 14th in as many years provides a forum 
for the leaders of the united states japan west germany britain 
france italy and canada to map out strategies to promote world 
growth 
but because the world economy is doing surprisingly well at 
present world leaders see no reason to launch any grand new 
initiatives at the threeday meeting which begins june 19 
economic growth has accelerated stubborn trade imbalances have 
finally begun to narrow and the dollar after a dizzying 
threeyear plunge has stabilized 
i think the world economy is in the best shape that it has 
been in going into any of the eight economic summits that i have 
attended with president reagan baker said at the end of last 
week during a relaxed interview in his office 
baker considered one of the presidents savviest political 
strategists served for four years as white house chief of staff 
before taking the treasury job in early 1985 
he said that the drive he began in september 1985 for closer 
international economic coordination among the summit countries 
known as the group of seven had helped the major industrialized 
countries withstand the shock from last octobers stock market 
collapse 
the group of seven countries in the aftermath of that event 
refused to turn inward they continued to cooperate closely to 
spend an extraordinary amount of time conferring by telephone with 
the result that some rather major remedial actions were taken 
baker said 
he said that interest rate reductions in europe trade 
adjustments in japan and the twoyear federal deficit reduction 
pact reached last december in the united states had all helped to 
calm financial market jitters and set the stage for accelerating 
growth 
we have a coordination process which has been tested by the 
adversity of the stock market crash he said i think the 
markets are becoming convinced that the g7 is unified and that we 
are acting in a coordinated and cooperative way 
baker said this renewed confidence had led to an increase in 
foreign private investment in the united states this year in 1987 
the flow of private funds which had been helping to finance the 
federal budget deficit almost dried up 
foreign central banks filled in the gap but baker said there 
was evidence that the amount of central bank purchases of us debt 
had fallen to roughly onefourth of what it was a year ago 
the administration is hoping to use reagans farewell summit to 
spotlight some of the presidents favorite themes including the 
need to cut tax rates and eliminate government regulations to spur 
free market enterprises 
this summit hopefully will recognize the contribution the 
reaganbush administrations policies have made to world growth 
policies which were derided when they were first proposed at the 
initial summit in 1981 baker said most of the major countries 
are now moving wholeheartedly toward freemarket economic policies 
such as deregulation privatization and tax reform 
baker is a close friend and adviser of bush and republican 
sources have said that the administration is already reviewing a 
short list of possible successors nicholas brady a wall street 
investment banker who is also a close confidant of bush has 
emerged as a leading candidate to succeed baker 
right before last years economic summit in venice the 
administration made a surprise announcement that alan greenspan 
would be replacing federal reserve chairman paul volcker and there 
had been speculation that bakers resignation and replacement would 
similarly be announced before the toronto summit 
but baker flatly rejected that scenario and turned aside all 
efforts to gauge when he might leave his treasury job to join the 
bush campaign 
i am not going to sit here and speculate with you on something 
that may never happen he said

radical students hurling firebombs 
stormed a major government building saturday and grappled with riot 
police after security forces blocked a reunification march to the 
north korean border 
police said 26 students forced their way past guards at the huge 
combined central government complex in the center of seoul which 
houses the prime ministers office the foreign ministry and other 
major government offices 
students smashed windows and damaged a police post and a waiting 
room in the complex with firebombs police said the complex is 
across a main road from the us embassy 
eight attackers barricaded themselves in a thirdfloor cafeteria 
in one building and hurled firebombs at riot police before being 
seized 
no injuries were reported police said 18 students were arrested 
punish the roh taewoo government and fight for 
unification the attackers screamed 
the students have accused president roh taewoo of repressive 
and undemocratic tactics aimed at keeping south korea separate from 
the communist north and allied with the united states 
the students launched the raid after the government on friday 
blocked their plans to march to the north korean border for talks 
with northern student delegates on reuniting the korean peninsula 
north koreas staterun korean central news agency said students 
rallied saturday in the north korean capital pyongyang to 
denounce the suppression of the march the report monitored in 
tokyo gave no attendance figures 
it said ko ung sam head of the norths student delegation to 
the planned border talks vowed to continue a persistent 
struggle for the meeting 
south korean riot police firing tear gas battled students 
hurling firebombs and rocks in fierce street clashes friday after 
the government blocked radicals attempts to march the 30 miles to 
the border 
police said saturday that more than 800 students were arrested 
in the clashes and more than 100 police and students were injured 
radical leaders at a rally saturday at yonsei university in 
seoul vowed to mount another march to the north korean border on 
aug 15 the national independence day they said they would not 
stop their struggle for reunification of the peninsula divided 
since 1945 
our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who want 
reunification of our land one leader said in a speech 
about 2000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans 
but the students mood was subdued and thousands of others who had 
gathered at the campus for the march friday left during the night 
speakers continued to denounce the united states and demand the 
withdrawal of the 42000 us troops based in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact 
yankee go home and reunification they chanted 
radicals claim the united states enforces partition of the 
korean peninsula so it can rule the south a wave of violent 
antiamerican protests has hit south korea during the past month 
small clashes denouncing the blocking of the march were reported 
in the provincial cities of taeju and kwangju riot police firing 
volleys of tear gas dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs 
the hardcore radicals who are often joined in protests by 
more moderate sympathizers represent no more than about 10 
percent of south korean college students and have failed to attract 
wide popular support with their reunification campaign 
most south koreans fear the totalitarian north is determined to 
conquer the south north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start 
the korean war and the two nations remain bitter enemies 
roh who took office feb 25 after elections in december has 
liberalized debate on unification but said the government not 
students should lead any dialogue with north korea 
a funeral was planned sunday in seoul for a radical student who 
died june 6 after setting himself on fire in a ritual protest 
three students have killed themselves in protests since may 15 in 
south korea dissidents sometimes use suicide as a way to call 
attention to their demands

twentyfive years after he stood 
facetoface with george wallace at the university of alabama 
nicholas katzenbach returned to the campus to discuss wallaces 
vain attempt to keep the school segregated 
katzenbach then an assistant us attorney general in the 
kennedy administration was sent to tuscaloosa to enroll two black 
students against the objections of wallace who was governor at the 
time a federal court had ordered the students admission 
at no time did we really know what gov wallace would do 
katzenbach said friday it made us nervous 
katzenbach now a lawyer in new jersey was among 400 
journalists academics and university alumni who took part in a 
threeday conference held to commemorate wallaces 1963 stand in 
the schoolhouse door 
wallace then serving the first of his four terms had vowed 
segregation forever in his inaugural address and had promised 
he would physically prevent any attempt to register blacks at the 
state university 
but wallace after a long statement in defiance of the central 
government relented allowing vivan malone and james hood to 
enroll 
wallace who is wheelchairbound as the result of an 
assassination attempt and has made few public appearances since 
leaving office last year declined an invitation to attend the 
conference an aide elvin stanton said wallace would not make a 
statement about the anniversary 
wallace who later changed his views on segregation has said 
that he made his stand largely to reduce the chances of violence 
hitting the tuscaloosa campus as it had at the university of 
mississippi earlier

author ae hotchner says the idea of 
giving stock in actor paul newmans food business to people who 
helped get it started was briefly discussed but people knew any 
stock would be largely ceremonial 
hotchner insisted that a delicatessen owner who says an attorney 
for newman promised him 8 percent of stock in the business was 
never among those considered for the gift 
newman hotchner testified friday wanted all profits from his 
newmans own inc to go to charity the stock idea was eventually 
abandoned in favor of newmans holding all stock in the company 
westport delicatessen owner julius gold contends that he 
contributed 30 months effort to newmans company and believed that 
his judgment and perseverance led to the success of this 
corporation 
newmans own whose products include salad dressing spaghetti 
sauce lemonade and popcorn has donated 15 million to charity 
since 1982 and helped create a camp for seriously ill children in 
northeastern connecticut the camp opened last week 
hotchner a close friend of newman who helped the actor launch 
newmans own in 1980 portrayed gold as just one of many people 
from whom he and newman casually sought advice 
the writer admitted however that gold did introduce him to a 
food distributor who eventually became the broker for the new salad 
dressing gold is also suing the broker 
nwman accompanied to court for the first time during the trial 
by his wife actress joanne woodward also revealed that his will 
specifies that all company profits will continue going to charity 
after his death

chinas official news agency said saturday that 
beijing university students are accusing the ussupported voice 
of america radio network of demagoguery in its reports on recent 
student unrest 
in washington the network denied the charge 
the harshly worded report by the xinhua news agency said voa 
which has a large audience in china had become a target of student 
criticism 
xinhua quoted one unidentified physics student as saying voa had 
blown the situation on the beijing university campus out of 
proportion 
he said the radio reported falsely that a student was arrested 
in a brief sitin at tiananmen square last wednesday it said voa 
gave a false impression by saying police had charged students to 
disperse them 
police on wednesday closed off the square to thwart a planned 
prodemocracy rally by students about a dozen students tried to 
stage a sitin on a sidewalk off the square but police stopped 
them police said one man was detained but he was not a student 
richard carlson director of the us broadcasting network said 
in a statement saturday that the voa rejects the charge of 
demagoguery or anything resembling that 
carlson said the network carefully sourced and verified the 
events before reporting them he said voa will continue to 
provide accurate information about events which affect them 
daily including calls for democracy and freedom 
the june 2 murder of a graduate student at the university 
ignited campus protests first of lax security and later of poor 
living conditions for intellectuals and the slow pace of democratic 
reform in china 
dozens of posters some criticizing the government were put up 
and 1000 students have gathered on a campus square each night to 
debate political issues and whether they should hold demonstrations 
xinhua quoted a student as saying voa is overly interested in 
bad news about china therefore i suspect it has the desire to 
see china plunged into chaos the student said 
a law student reportedly asked is the radio not trying to 
make the situation worse 
chinas official media have criticized voa for its reports on 
nationwide prodemocracy student demonstrations in december 1986 
and january 1987 the network said its reports were balanced 
voa which broadcasts in chinese english and 42 other 
languages is a major source of information for students trying to 
find out what is happening on campuses throughout china

here is the text of president reagans 
weekly radio address as delivered saturday from his official 
retreat at camp david 
my fellow americans in one week i go to toronto for the annual 
economic summit with the leaders of the major industrial 
democracies the united states along with our strong allies 
canada france germany great britain italy japan and the 
european community form the industrial and technological backbone 
of the free world 
this will be my eighth and final economic summit and therell 
be much to celebrate perhaps foremost will be the worldwide 
economic revolution that has unleashed ever greater levels of 
prosperity with lower tax rates america led the way with major tax 
cuts and tax reform and the other major industrial democracies 
have either cut their tax rates or are now in the process of doing 
so 
im proud to say that we now lead the world with the lowest top 
personal tax rate of any of the major economic powers were also 
leading the way in creating jobs providing employment for a 
greater percentage of our labor force than any of the other major 
industrial democracies 
in fact us employment is at its highest level ever and weve 
also brought down inflation and interest rates its not surprising 
that country after country has followed us on the path to greater 
economic freedom and begun to replace their statist policies with 
deregulation privatization and freer trade 
one of the great lessons of the last seven years is that when 
people in free economies are allowed to trade with one another 
around the world the result is greater prosperity for us all 
certainly the united states has been one of the biggest gainers in 
the global economy youve probably heard that were now in the 
longest peacetime economic expansion in us history but this is 
also the first economic expansion in the postwar period in which 
the us economy has grown faster than most of its major trading 
partners 
so yes were doing particularly well but when free countries 
trade and invest with one another there are no losers only 
winners today we have a global economy in which the united states 
is at the very center of total foreign direct investment in the 
world nearly 40 percent by far the largest share consists of 
americans investing overseas but its not a oneway street at the 
same time the united states also receives more foreign investment 
from abroad than any other country so we truly are the investment 
capital of the world 
the same thing is true regarding trade we import more and 
export more than any other country on earth with that in mind i 
want to reaffirm my commitment to enactment this year of 
responsible trade legislation to help achieve positive trade 
legislation ive directed my senior advisors to stand ready to 
assist the congressional leadership on a new trade bill one that 
will strengthen americas international competitiveness and create 
even more new jobs for americans 
and make no mistake the global economy is the basis of our 
prosperity and the foundation of our economic future i can think 
of no surer way of derailing our economy than to try through 
protectionist measures to seal america off from trade and 
investment with the other countries of the world 
im reminded of the story of the sunday school teacher who asks 
her class who wants to go to heaven well all of the children 
raised their hands except for one little boy in the back of the 
room the teacher astounded says charlie dont you want to go 
to heaven sure i do he says just not with this bunch 
well fortunately we and our trading partners are going to deal 
with economic matters together because thats the only way to move 
ahead 
im glad to say were moving away from protectionism and toward 
greater economic growth and job creation one of the historic 
events of our time is the uscanada free trade agreement that i 
entered into this year with prime minister brian mulroney this 
agreement between the worlds two greatest trading partners will 
eliminate tariff barriers between the united states and canada by 
the year 1999 and establish the largest free trade area on earth 
the advantages to both our countries will be enormous in terms 
of jobs and prosperity but as much as this pathbreaking agreement 
does for the people of the united states and canada this 
agreement looked at in the sweep of history is truly a gift to 
the world it creates a model that can be imitated and expanded 
and ultimately made universal among free nations and thats 
something we can truly be proud of 
and finally tuesday is flag day the anniversary of the first 
official american flag nancy and i hope that youll join us and 
millions other americans tuesday evening at 7 oclock eastern 
daylight time in the annual pause for the pledge until next 
week thanks for listening and god bless you

the russians are coming and the men and 
women of the us air force 487th tactical missile wing are 
preparing to show them what few americans have seen 112 cruise 
missiles 
the missiles and their camouflaged launchers positioned at this 
base in remote southeastern sicily are stored under tons of earth 
and concrete and surrounded by four rows of chainlink fence topped 
with barbed wire 
soviet inspectors will arrive sometime after july 1 to count the 
missiles and launchers to be eliminated under terms of the 
superpower intermediaterange nuclear force treaty which went into 
effect june 1 
lt col joseph wagovich a spokesman for the us onsite 
inspection agency told visiting reporters friday that over the 
next three years the missiles and launchers will be sent to the 
united states and destroyed under the eyes of soviet inspectors 
exactly when they are going or how they are going i am not 
at liberty to say he said 
wagovich said the plan is to send the missiles to the davis 
mathis air force base in arizona 
us inspectors will monitor the elimination of intermediate 
range missiles in the soviet union east germany and czechoslovakia 
wagovich said inspection agency officials are working quickly to 
make sure everything is ready for the soviets who can make their 
first visit between july 1 and the end of august 
we have had a very short time to recruit and train inspectors 
and escorts it has been a very extensive effort we have conducted 
mock inspections testing different scenarios said wagovich 
two soviet reporters already have visited this highsecurity 
base they came friday with other reporters from italy the united 
states britain and france 
soviet and eastbloc journalists have also been shown missile 
bases in britain west germany and belgium western reporters 
visited a soviet base in the northern republic of ukraine on june 3 
during the visit to comiso capt don sparks demonstrated how 
the launchers are raised and prepared for action but the air force 
did not allow reporters to see a cruise missile 
each of the mobile launchers can fire four 21foot missiles that 
can deliver a 200kiloton nuclear warhead 1500 miles at almost the 
speed of sound 
the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima japan in 1945 had an 
explosive force of 20 kilotons 
air force officials citing security reasons declined to 
discuss the number of warheads at comiso or their total destructive 
force 
the italian government agreed in 1982 to take the missiles and 
comiso became the second base in europe to accept cruise missiles 
the first were located at greenham common england 
air force officials estimate that the base a mostly treeless 
379acre expanse of asphalt sunbaked earth and brown and beige 
stucco buildings pumps 182 million a year into the local 
economy 
us and italian officials said no decision has been made on how 
to use the base once the missiles have left or on what to do with 
the 1750 american and 179 italian military personnel 
americans first came to this base 45 years ago 
on july 11 1943 american troops commanded by lt gen omar 
bradley captured the axis airfield after allied bombers hammered 
the base 
six days later allied fighter planes began to use the air base

states which supports the guerrillas is partly to blame

its a simple toy conceived when a 
stonemason watched a group of children playing with sticks pencils 
and empty thread spools but since their introduction 75 years ago 
sunday tinkertoys have found their way into millions of toyboxes 
chemistry labs and even industrial drawing boards 
its a classic said debbie wager who oversees the annual 
toy quality report from the liberal political action group 
americans for democratic action there are not too many toys that 
have been around for three or four years let alone 75 
tinkertoys were introduced at the 1913 american toy fair by 
inventor charles pajeau of evanston ill but it was a year before 
they caught on 
in a 1914 publicity stunt so successful it halted traffic while 
motorists gawked pajeau hired midgets to dress up like santas 
elves and play with tinkertoys in a window of new york citys grand 
central station according to a toy is born by marvin kaye 
since then more than 100 million tinkertoy sets have found 
their way to the young and youngatheart 
chemistry professors use them to make molecular models indiana 
bell telephone uses them to test management candidates and lockheed 
corp used them for design models 
still its the children who continue to make the toy 
popular said wayne charness spokesman for tinkertoy 
manufacturer hasbro inc of pawtucket 
its a great toy because kids can use their imagination with 
it and build anything they want said wager of the 
washingtonbased lobby group they can take it apart and build 
something different with it 10 minutes later 
a youngster in 1913 87yearold myrtle green of north 
providence remembers playing with tinkertoys when they were first 
introduced 
we used to make cars and houses and everything she said 
after watching her children and grandchildren grow up playing 
with them she says it keeps the kids busy and they enjoy it it 
keeps them quiet 
while mrs green and others may feel sentimental seeing their 
offspring play with the familiar toy nostalgia doesnt carry much 
weight with todays youngsters 
little kids are pretty savvy charness said if they have 
done everything a toy has to offer the first few times they play 
with it it will stay in the toy box but if you provide a toy 
thats going to challenge them every time they use it thats the 
toy youre going to have to pick up after them every time they 
play 
and what do children make with the multicolored wooden sticks 
and spools 
it could be nothing it could be a helicopter it could be the 
eiffel tower said charness whatever it is it gives them a 
sense of accomplishment he said 
tinkertoys havent changed much over the years first introduced 
in metal canisters they were sold in boxes for a time until last 
year when hasbro returned to the original packaging he said 
in 1983 plastic pieces were added to allow for more 
construction possibilities said charness 
first marketed by the toy tinkers of evanston the toy changed 
companies several times until 1986 when hasbro acquired tinkertoys 
as part of a purchase of the new yorkbased cbs toys and its 
playskool subsidiary 
sets of tinkertoys come in four sizes beginning at about 599 
charness said 
imitators have developed over the years but tinkertoys continue 
to hold their share of the market selling about a million sets a 
year he said 
although new to the tinkertoy tradition the worlds largest toy 
maker celebrated tinkertoys 75th birthday last week with a 
4foothigh multitiered birthday cake made of tinkertoys

president reagan said saturday that he is 
looking forward to the economic summit in toronto and warned 
congress not to try through protectionist measures to seal 
america off from trade and investment with the other countries of 
the world 
in his weekly radio speech delivered from the presidential 
hideaway at camp david in the western maryland hills reagan 
reiterated his pledge to work with congress to reshape the trade 
bill that he vetoed 
the senate sustained the presidents veto on wednesday 
make no mistake the global economy is the basis of our 
prosperity and the foundation of our economic future the 
president said i can think of no surer way of derailing our 
economy than to try through protectionist measures to seal america 
off from trade and investment with the other countries of the 
world 
but rep richard gephardt dmo said in the democrats 
response that the trade bill was needed to put our economic ship 
of state back on course 
we cant continue to follow the course set by this 
administration gephardt said weve seen our position as the 
worlds largest creditor nation erode to that of the largest 
debtor we continue to run historic trade deficits 
the plain and painful fact is that without any incentive for 
reciprocity many of our trading partners are using our outdated 
assumptions to take advantage of us gephardt said 
the president will meet with leaders of britain canada france 
italy japan west germany and the european economic community in 
toronto on june 1921 
this will be my eighth and final economic summit and there 
will be much to celebrate he said 
perhaps foremost will be the worldwide economic revolution 
that has unleashed ever greater levels of prosperity with lower tax 
rates he said 
he said that america had led the way in tax cuts and 
marketoriented economic policies and that the other industrialized 
democracies had followed 
its not surprising that country after country has followed us 
on the path to greater economic freedom and began to replace their 
statist policies with deregulation privatization and freer 
trade the president said 
reagan described the free trade agreement reached by the united 
states and canada last year as one of the historic events of our 
time the agreement is designed to eliminate trade barriers 
between the two countries by the end of the century 
this agreement looked at in the sweep of history is truly a 
gift to the world he said it creates a model that can be 
imitated and expanded and ultimately made universal among free 
nations and thats something we can truly be proud of 
turning to his dealings with congress reagan said i want to 
reaffirm my commitment to enactment this year of responsible trade 
legislation 
to help achieve positive trade legislation i have directed my 
senior advisers to stand ready to assist the congressional 
leadership on a new trade bill one that will strengthen americas 
economic competitiveness and create even more new jobs for 
americans he said

while six jurors decide a lungcancer 
victims damage claims against three cigarettemakers the defense 
is gearing up its public relations engine 
each day the jury deliberated last week a public relations firm 
for two of the defendants reserved satellite time for a package of 
background videotape expert commentary graphics on 30 years of 
tobacco cases and live interviews with lawyers the material is 
intended for use on television stations 
the federal lawsuit waged by antonio cipollone over the 1984 
death of his wife rose at 58 has drawn heavy media coverage and 
the tobacco companies have waged a major public relations offensive 
throughout the 4month trial 
the jury deliberated last week for four days beginning tuesday 
it took the weekend off and will return to the case monday 
lorillard inc liggett group inc and philip morris inc are 
accused of misleading the public about the dangers of cigarette 
smoking through advertising public relations and inadequate 
research 
antismoking advocates have hailed the trial as a gold mine of 
bad publicity for the 22 billion industry because of dozens of 
confidential company documents presented as evidence 
the documents spoke of a gentlemens agreement not to 
conduct cancer research of an industry strategy to create 
doubt about the health charge without actually denying it of a 
research program designed so that the results can not harm 
the industry 
the companies say the documents were taken out of context that 
mrs cipollone freely chose to smoke knowing the risks and that 
smoking is not a proven cancer cause 
on hand almost every day for damage control during the trial 
were five public relations experts including three from the daniel 
j edelman inc firm which represents lorillard and philip morris 
and arranged for the satellite feed a lawyer also was present to 
answer reporters questions 
after liggetts attorney delivered closing arguments a 
spokesman at the courtroom door handed out a news release 
containing the lawyers statement 
this is by everyones admission the most critical case the 
one that attracted the most attention among tobacco liability 
suits said edelman senior vice president john scanlon 
philip morris spokesman tom ricke said the satellite feed is 
partly a solution to the large number of requests for interviews 
from television stations 
one of the problems we have is win or lose our side 
historically hasnt gotten a lot of play especially in the 
electronic media he said 
the feed will include live interviews with tobacco trial 
attorneys to discuss the legal issues and arguments according to 
an advisory sent to television stations a wall street analyst on 
tape will discuss the impact of the verdict on the tobacco 
industry and a legal expert will talk about the implications of 
such suits for society 
television stations also can receive footage of cigarette 
production and of stacks of industry documents provided to 
cipollones attorneys 
neither scanlon nor ricke would comment on the cost of the feed 
which is being produced by the business television division of 
visnews international a tv news agency a satellite company 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said reserving eight 
hours of satellite time averages about 5000 not including 
production and distribution costs

a former governor fighting to defeat a 
state lottery initiative for the second time in as many years has 
picked up an unlikely ally representatives of the states 
multimilliondollar gambling industry 
they just happen to be on the same side that weve been on 
since the proposal on lotteries has started said arthur link a 
former congressman who was north dakota governor from 1972 to 1980 
i dont think its ironic 
lined up in opposition with link who opposes a state lottery as 
a regressive tax on poorer citizens are charities that are allowed 
to run casino gambling in north dakota 
the proposals primary backer predicts the measure will succeed 
this year helped by increased public awareness of flourishing 
lotteries in neighboring south dakota and montana 
good god were the only one left says gorman king sr a 
mandan businessman who is spearheading the prolottery effort 
twentysix states and the district of columbia are operating 
lotteries and wisconsin and virginia are scheduled to start them 
this summer voters in neighboring minnesota are to decide in 
november whether to allow one 
north dakota is the only state that has voted down a staterun 
lottery 
voters will cast ballots in tuesdays primary on whether to 
approve a state lottery which is now banned by the state 
constitution the states voters first rejected a lottery almost a 
century ago after gambling interests attempted to bribe the 
legislature into starting one 
the constitution was changed recently to allow publicspirited 
organizations to run gambling casinos and more than 300 groups 
ranging from humane societies to american legion posts offer 
bingo blackjack and other games to benefit a variety of charities 
north dakotans spent 1892 million on charitable gambling last 
year and once prizes taxes and allowable expenses were deducted 
charities netted slightly more than 17 million in 1987 according 
to the most recent attorney generals report 
critics contend a lottery would lure away the discretionary cash 
north dakotans now use for bingo and blackjack and thus hurt the 
charities 
it could have a direct effect on the organizations that are 
trying to continue to fund their programs said rs guilderhus 
executive director of the fargobased red river human services 
foundation 
a lottery could conceivably drain away 70 to 80 percent of the 
500000 in annual gambling proceeds his foundation now spends on 
services gilderhus said 
winston satran director of the home on the range for boys near 
sentinel butte in extreme western north dakota said about 15 
percent of the ranchs private donations come from fraternal 
organizations that raise money from gambling 
i think those lottery dollars would be diverted from what is 
being spent on charitable gambling now he said 
king estimates a north dakota lottery would gross 20 million 
annually with half of that sum returned to players as prizes of 
the remainder 7 million or 35 percent would go to the state 
general fund 10 percent would pay for lottery expenses and 5 
percent would go to vendors as commissions 
it would be that much less that the legislature would be in 
your pocket for king said of the projected 7 million in 
proceeds and its a voluntary tax its up to you whether you 
want to do it or not 
link a longtime friend of king contends a lottery amounts to a 
regressive tax on lowerincome people and that its benefits would 
be outweighed by its potential social costs 
a lottery also represents a step beyond the existing charitable 
gambling industry said link 
this changes the role of government completely in that it 
puts the state government as the official promoter link said 
the state is encouraging its own citizens to buy into a game 
of chance where most of them have to lose thats not the role of 
state government

the automobile was once an efficient way to 
get around but now causes such traffic woes and health hazards that 
people must learn to use other transportation methods said a study 
released saturday 
excessive reliance on cars can actually stifle rather than 
advance societies said the study by worldwatch a private 
thinktank 
the study estimated the number of passenger cars in use 
worldwide grew from 53 million in 1950 to 386 million in 1986 
as a result motorists in hundreds of cities creep forward at 
speeds slower than a bicycles the study said it said that more 
than 200000 people died in 1985 in traffic accidents worldwide in 
the united states some 30000 people die each year of diseases 
resulting from the use of gasoline and diesel fuel the study said 
it is time to build a bridge from an autocentered society 
into an alternative transportation future in which cars buses 
rail systems bicycles and walking all complement each other the 
study said 
it said governments should discourage auto use where possible 
require cars be made more fuel efficient and less polluting expand 
public masstransit systems and encourage affordable housing near 
jobs 
in the long run moving urban patterns away from the sprawl 
generated by the automobile is a solution the study said 
what people need is access to jobs homes and services the 
study said more compact and integrated communities can provide 
such access without long commutes

an amnesia victim who walked into a 
pizza parlor six weeks ago and said help me i dont know who i 
am now faces a new identity crisis 
ive gotten lots of calls saying im two entirely different 
people said the man who dubbed himself john jackson after he 
was taken to a homeless shelter in huntington 
jacksons ordeal began may 3 when he woke up beside railroad 
tracks and interstate 64 near where the borders of west virginia 
ohio and kentucky meet 
i woke up in a field and the first thing i thought was its 
cold and then i wondered where am i and then who am i 
then i realized i had no answers and it got very frightening 
jackson said friday 
he remembers certain things about certain places but he cant 
remember his right name said a volunteer at the huntington city 
rescue mission 
he was bewildered more than anything else said mission cook 
virginia berry he was dressed ok had on blue jeans he has a 
beard but its welltrimmed and shaped and been taken care of his 
hairs that way too 
the man asked the mission staff to call him jackson because he 
remembers roads and a baseball park in jacksonville fla 
once when asked to sign his name he started to write the 
letter p and then i forgot the only name right then i could 
think of that started with a p was paul so maybe my first name is 
paul i dont know he said 
he said he thinks he was born jan 1 1948 which would make him 
40 but doctors say he might be in his mid30s 
berry said jackson has occasional flashbacks but they go so 
fast he cant understand them 
he remembers military installations such as fort huachuca in 
southern arizona and he remembers places in chicago 
mission workers asked jacksonville newspapers to publish the 
mans photograph and on friday he was inundated by calls from 
people claiming to know him 
jackson did not recognize any of the callers although some of 
the details they provided matched the few pieces he has to his 
puzzle 
one group of people who saw jacksons photograph told him they 
believe he is roy moses 33 who frequently vanished for months at 
a time on a whim 
moses stepmother stepsister and brotherinlaw all talked to 
jackson on the telephone and they seem convinced thats who i 
am but jackson said the family could provide few details so 
im not so sure 
another jacksonville resident said he recognized jackson as 
michael shawper 40 a career navy man the caller knew several 
littleknown naval bases that jackson remembers and the 
knowledge of history and geography that matches but he said the 
last time he had seen shawper was 11 years ago in guam 
shawper and moses both attended the same college in 
jacksonville one has been married two or three times the other 
once 
so im either an educated responsible man or an educated 
irresponsible man jackson said i cant be both thats for 
sure one of them has to be wrong they both may be wrong 
he said he is being cautious until his fingerprints are checked 
monday against those of moses and shawper 
doctors at a local mental health center who see jackson twice a 
week say that since he suffered no physical trauma he might have 
suffered an emotional one 
so ill remember and i wont like what i remember or i wont 
ever remember and i wont like that either jackson said 
it is not a pleasant choice but i would prefer to be me he 
said 
there are nights when i lie awake at night thinking and 
theres nothing to think about

supporters and critics of 
archbishop desmond tutu scuffled saturday during rival 
demonstrations before the black anglican leader embarked on a trip 
to moscow 
at least one black man a supporter of tutu was taken into 
custody and police ordered all members of the public to leave the 
main hall at johannesburgs jan smuts airport 
about 100 of tutus supporters remained in the hall and chanted 
the archbishops name when he arrived on a connecting flight from 
cape town 
police and clergymen escorted tutu and his wife leah through 
the hall as his supporters most of them black cheered many white 
onlookers stared in amazement 
he gave a final wave to the crowd before entering the 
international departure area to catch a flight to london he is to 
fly to moscow on sunday to join ecumenical celebrations of the 
1000th anniversary of the russian orthodox church 
about 15 antitutu protesters including a few blacks and a 
white woman with charcoal on her face and wearing a bishops 
costume assembled at jan smuts with placards denouncing the 
archbishops support for sanctions against south africa one poster 
termed tutu moscows puppet while another said red carpet 
for tutu red bombs for us 
it was the fourth airport protest against tutu since he returned 
three weeks ago from a trip to europe and the united states during 
that trip he repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against south 
africa as a means of promoting racial reform 
saturday marked the first time during the series of protests 
that antitutu demonstrators were outnumbered by supporters of the 
archbishop who won the nobel peace prize in 1984 for his fight 
against south africas policy of white domination 
the altercation began after some of the supporters grabbed an 
antitutu poster and tore it police announced over the public 
address system that the arrival hall should be vacated but many 
people including members of the rival protest groups remained 
when tutu arrived about 45 minutes after the scuffle one woman 
cursed him but few of his other critics were visible 
participants in the earlier antitutu protests have included 
whites from rightwing organizations and jobless blacks recruited 
by conservative black politicians all the protests have been 
filmed and shown on the national television news by the staterun 
south african broadcasting corp which frequently denounces tutu 
tutu has described sanctions as one of the few nonviolent means 
of pressuring the government to end apartheid under which south 
africas 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs 
sanctions could be avoided he says if the government dismantled 
apartheid and moved to grant the black majority full political 
rights 
tutus critics contend that sanctions will result in higher 
black unemployment while hardening the attitudes of proapartheid 
whites 
these critics also claim most blacks oppose sanctions but there 
is no means of verifying this endorsement of sanctions is illegal 
under emergency regulations and blacks are not allowed to vote in 
national elections or referendums 
the rev frank chikane secretary general of the south african 
council of churches said this week that the antitutu protests 
were being orchestrated to give the impression that there was 
mounting protest against antiapartheid groups

a dissident said saturday that kgb agents in 
civilian clothes beat and threw protesters to the ground while 
breaking up an unauthorized demonstration by dissidents demanding 
the release of political prisoners 
yuri mityunov said at least 12 members of the democratic union 
opposition political group were dragged away and detained 15 
minutes after the protest began saturday in moscows pushkin square 
the kgb were extremely rough mityunov the democratic 
unions spokesman said in a telephone interview they threw 
people to the ground and beat one woman so badly that people 
became indignant 
western journalists at the scene said young men in civilian 
clothes dragged the demonstrators off the square a week ago a 
demonstration was held in the same square but was not interrupted 
the protesters saturday said by mityunov to number about 100 
had gathered to call for the release of valeriya novotvorskaya 38 
who was detained at 6 am friday at her moscow apartment 
the philologist and library worker one of the founders of the 
fledgling democratic union is accused of taking part in an illegal 
demonstration on april 15 other members of the group say she has a 
history of heart problems and is very ill 
mityunov said police did not permit her to take her medicine 
with her when she was detained and said police refused her request 
for medical assistance 
mityunov said the protesters in pushkin square carried banners 
calling for the release of ms novotvorskaya for freedom for all 
soviets imprisoned for their views and for an end to repression 
he said one man was detained for handing out leaflets that 
called for ms novotvorskayas release and that the others were 
taken away by police because they had been carrying protest signs 
they are now in one of moscows militia stations mityunov 
said officials are not telling us where 
last sunday members of the democratic union joined with groups 
of armenians and crimean tatars on pushkin square to call for the 
release of soviet political prisoners 
when the demonstrators marched down gorky street they were 
given a police escort although they were not allowed to proceed to 
red square their chosen destination police made no move to stop 
them when they gathered across from moscows city hall and chanted 
slogans 
the democratic union was organized last month by a group of 
soviets who want to challenge the political monopoly of the 
communist party among other goals they are seeking a multiparty 
parliamentary system along western lines and the withdrawal of 
soviet troops from eastern europe and territory incorporated by the 
soviet union during world war ii 
group members say that if soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness is genuine they will be 
allowed to campaign for office 
however mityunov said the fact that kgb agents and not police 
officers broke up saturdays demonstration was significant and 
potentially worrisome 
the committee for state security known by its russianlanguage 
initials as the kgb is attached to the council of ministers the 
equivalent of the countrys cabinet 
authorities here have decided to permit a small possibility of 
democratization but now theyre starting to make 
differentiations mityunov said i think the powers that be 
want to make a selection and arrest members of groups that are 
hostile to them 
he said other unofficial groups were allowed to gather on 
pushkin square at 4 pm less than one hour after the democratic 
unions protest was broken up and that no official move was made 
to disperse them

the industrial giant daimlerbenz 
which forced thousands of people into work programs to fuel the 
nazi war effort will pay nearly 12 million to the laborers and 
their families the red cross said 
heinz galinski chairman of the west german jewish council on 
saturday welcomed news of the payment but said the company should 
have made reparations years ago 
to wait this long is a horrible betrayal of all those who 
suffered galinski said it comes too late for the thousands 
who have died in the meantime 
the red cross in a telex statement friday to the news media 
said a total of 20 million marks or 117 million would be 
distributed to forced labor victims from the company 
the agency said the money would go to former forced laborers and 
to the families of people who died while in forced labor with 
daimlerbenz 
daimlerbenz the largest industrial conglomerate in west 
germany joins other major german companies that have paid such 
reparations it manufactures buses and automobiles including the 
mercedesbenz and its wideranging subsidiaries include a major 
aerospace manufacturer 
the announcement of daimlerbenzs payments followed a lengthy 
study the company commissioned to determine the extent to which 
forced laborers were used in its plants during world war ii 
daimlerbenz had no immediate comment on the payment but 
scheduled a press conference monday at its headquarters in 
stuttgart and said details of the company study would be released 
then 
company officials said the conference would focus on the dark 
chapter of forced labor during the nazi regime at daimlerbenz 
like other german companies during adolf hitlers third reich 
daimler used forced laborers to help the nazi effort thousands of 
forced workers died from illtreatment or were murdered in nazi 
concentration camps 
according to a study released in 1987 by an independent 
historical research group more than 46000 forced laborers were 
being used in daimlerbenz factories in 1944 
the study compiled by the hamburg foundation for 20th century 
social history concluded that by the end of the war half the 
company workers were forced laborers 
they included people deported from occupied territories 
prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates the study said 
the study detailed brutal work conditions and executions of 
workers accused of sabotage 
it also concluded that daimler management conspired with nazi 
leaders in the early 1930s to make the company the countrys chief 
producer of engines and vehicles for the military 
many of the laborers were from france and the soviet union a 
1986 study by the cologne society for industrial history indicates 
in 1986 the giant flick conglomerate paid 29 million to slave 
labor victims other west german firms such as the giant krupp 
concern a major weapons producer during world war ii have also 
paid reparations 
in addition to the company payments west germany has paid 
billions of dollars in reparations to victims of the nazi regime 
in 1952 the luxembourg agreement was signed between west 
germany and the world jewish congress 
under terms of the agreement west germany has paid 48 billion 
to holocaust survivors

acknowledged he didnt itemize a 350000 campaign loan on his 
financial statements but it will be up to a jury to decide this 
week if that failure was a criminal act 
closing arguments are scheduled tuesday after seven days of 
testimony in the trial of the impeached mecham and his brother 
willard on charges of concealing the loan 
the prosecutions case is based on smoke and mirrors mecham 
told reporters after the defense rested its case friday without 
testimony from either defendant 
im confident that the state has not proven its case the 
former governor said although he stopped short of predicting he 
will be acquitted 
we are confident that the jury will return a just verdict 
prosecutor barnett lotstein said friday 
mecham a republican was removed from office april 4 by 
impeachment conviction on two unrelated charges the state senate 
decided not to consider a charge on the loan for fear of 
prejudicing the criminal trial 
he also was the subject of a recall movement but an election 
was canceled after his impeachment conviction 
mecham 64 first received national attention in january 1987 
for his decision to cancel a martin luther king holiday for state 
executive branch workers on grounds it was illegally created by his 
predecessor democrat bruce babbitt without legislative 
authorization 
mecham also drew criticism for defending an authors use of the 
word pickaninny in a book in reference to black children and 
he made a variety of statements that offended women jews 
homosexuals and japaneseamericans 
in the criminal case he faces up to 22 years in prison if 
convicted on all six felony counts of perjury willful concealment 
and filing false documents 
willard mecham who was treasurer for his younger brothers 1986 
campaign faces up to 9 years in prison if convicted of three 
similar counts 
the prosecution contended that mechams campaign badly needed 
the 350000 loan from developer barry wolfson but that mecham 
wanted to conceal its source because it would contradict his 
campaign theme of being beholden to no one 
none of mechams personal or campaign financial reports lists a 
350000 loan from wolfson instead one campaign report includes a 
465000 lump sum identified as a contribution from mecham himself 
the 450000 also included a 100000 loan to mecham from a 
financial institution and a 15000 contribution by mecham 
the mechams put up two defenses that the loan was properly 
listed as part of the 465000 lump sum and that the failure to 
itemize the loan was an innocent mistake by willard mecham 
also former top mecham aide edith richardson testified for the 
defense that the loan was common knowledge among mechams inner 
circle 
the prosecution said it was immaterial whether mechams closest 
aides knew about the wolfson loan 
this is the document where the public gets its information 
isnt that true prosecutor michael cudahy asked one witness 
referring to mechams contribution and expenditure report im 
not talking about insiders in the campaign finance chairmen close 
confidantes of evan mecham 
mecham long has acknowledged that the wolfson loan appeared 
nowhere on his financial statements outside of the 465000 lump 
sum until he filed an amended form in november 1987 
he also insisted last fall that the loan was made to the 
campaign not to him personally 
but wolfson testified that he considered the loan a personal 
one not to the campaign 
a former mecham campaign finance committee member vern gasser 
testified that he couldnt recall the meaning of notes he took 
during a committee meeting in fall 1986 the notes said show evan 
borrowed money and dont show borrowed money 
mecham refused to say friday why he did not testify his 
attorney michael scott said he wanted to avoid having his client 
brutalized on crossexamination

here is the text of the democratic partys 
response to president reagans weekly radio address saturday given 
by rep richard gephardt of missouri 
since 1981 weve seen our trade deficit skyrocket more than 
four times over weve seen millions of manufacturing jobs lost and 
thousands of farmers thrown off their land 
during these years the president has stood idly by failing to 
develop a trade policy to enhance american competitiveness he even 
called our trade deficit a sign of strength 
three years ago the democrats took the bull by the horns and 
crafted a trade policy that would enhance our competitiveness we 
fought for fundamental change in our trade policy and were able to 
forge a consensus at least among democrats about what we must do 
to do compete strengthen education improve productivity and 
invest in plan and equipment and people the human factor would be 
the most decisive factor of production 
in a historic effort democrats working with republicans were 
able to craft a bill it took three years and countless discussions 
to write it was designed to put the tools in the hands of our 
workers and businesses to improve our competitiveness and pry open 
markets 
despite the strong support for the bill president reagan vetoed 
the measure in doing so he deprived us of the trade policy we so 
desperately need 
president reagan based his veto on his objection to the plant 
closing provision in the bill a provision which he claims will 
hurt business and had nothing to do with trade america needs the 
plant closing law 
if were going to prepare for the future rather than protect 
against it we must give our workers the time needed to adjust and 
find new employment its a simple provision it requires 
management to give workers a 60day notice of impending plant 
closure nothing more nothing less 
during my travels across the country i met countless workers 
who had suffered from the lack of a plantclosing provision there 
is simply no justification for a worker showing up at the plant 
gate for work to find it chained shut 
many businesses have joined with the president in fighting the 
provision at the same time they have fought for their own golden 
parachute and 60day notification for themselves in hostile 
takeover situations they refuse to grant workers the same 
consideration 
i refuse to accept the presidents notion that people can be 
treated just like any other asset to be discarded when no longer 
needed our workers are the best in the world theyve proven their 
ability to adapt to change in many cases labor and management 
working together have been able to find solutions to the companys 
problems 
the plant closing provision is an investment in our people its 
unfortunate that the president chose to scuttle the trade bill 
because of his opposition to this provision we desperately need a 
trade bill trade is not an academic issue it is a human issue we 
cant continue to follow the course set by this administration 
weve seen our position as the worlds largest creditor nation 
erode to that of the largest debtor we continue to run historic 
trade deficits behind these numbers are real people business 
people and workers whove seen their companies go under because of 
unfair foreign competition farmers who have lost their farms 
because they cant sell their products overseas 
its time for a change in our trade policy to put our economic 
ship of state back on course the plain and painful fact is that 
without any incentive for reciprocity many of our trading partners 
are using our outdated assumptions to take advantage of us weve 
got to realize that the world has changed and we must change with 
it 
mr president the trade deficit is not a sign of strength its 
a sign of a failed policy we must now work together to change that 
policy and make america strong again

a judge has ordered that millions of 
dollars believed channeled into swiss banks by former philippines 
president ferdinand marcos be returned to his homeland the justice 
ministry said saturday 
although no figure was given the assets involved were believed 
to be a small part of the 1 billion that philippines officials 
suspect marcos put into swiss bank accounts during his 20year rule 
the ruling covered assets in banks in the western state of 
fribourg 
swiss media said marcos has 50 million in fribourg banks but 
justice ministry spokesman joerg kistler refused comment on the 
reports 
the judge also gave authorities in the philippines access to 
relevant bank records in fribourg one of 26 cantons or states in 
switzerland the ruling seems certain to be challenged by marcos 
lawyers 
president corazon aquino of the philippines arrives on an 
official visit on wednesday and is expected to discuss her 
governments efforts to recoup marcos assets in switzerland the 
assets have been frozen by the government since march 1986 
in an unpublished decision tuesday investigating magistrate 
pierreemmanuel esseiva freed the fribourg assets for delivery to a 
philippines criminal court which will decide if they were 
illegally acquired kistler said 
bank documents will be given to the philippines general 
prosecutor he said 
a ruling by switzerlands highest court in july 1987 lifted bank 
secrecy for an investigation of marcos assets by swiss 
authorities but manila was not given access to the results of that 
probe 
most of the marcos assets are believed to be in zurich where 
appeals by marcos lawyers and credit suisse bank have delayed 
investigators 
by contrast authorities in geneva are expected to rule soon on 
a repatriation of any assets they have found 
marcos who was deposed in february 1986 and now lives in exile 
in hawaii has denied having money in swiss banks

sparks flew saturday among 
democratic platform writers over whether to raise taxes on wealthy 
americans the issue creating the largest gulf between the camps of 
cinch presidential nominee michael dukakis and runnerup jesse 
jackson 
the plaform drafters put off until sunday discussion of defense 
and foreign policy issues while their staffs worked behind the 
scenes to draft planks on drugs civil rights the economy and 
other domestic issues 
janice thurmond an athens ga lawyer and jackson delegate 
urged the platform committee to lend dukakis a hand by giving 
him a credible platform including a pledge to raise taxes on those 
earning 100000plus a year 
i am not trying to hamstring our partys nominee we need 
to give him an answer that is believable when he is accused of 
being a taxandspend democrat thurmond told her 15 colleagues 
on the drafting panel 
it would be irresponsible of us not to give him an answer that 
he can look any republican straight in the eye and say i am not a 
taxandspend democrat i am a raiserevenueandinvestinamerica 
democrat and be proud of that said thurmond whose father was 
jacksons football coach in high school 
but lena guerrero a texas state representative and dukakis 
backer from austin said the talk of raising taxes troubled her 
i think what we have to do is reorder our priorities she 
said surely there is a better solution than give me more 
other dukakis delegates said the party should look first to 
crack down on tax evaders as the massachusetts governor has 
promised 
rep robert matsui of california said i find no need to even 
raise it in the platform because that would give bush the 
opportunity to say oh look theyre interested in at least some 
kind of new taxes 
michael barnes dukakiss top emissary to the platform 
committee made a conciliatory statement saying if it were 
required to have revenue increases down the road clearly democrats 
are going to see that as a last resort any new revenues would be 
based upon policies that recognize who has the ability to pay 
he added 
but barnes told reporters afterwards the democratic platform 
in 1988 is not going to call for a tax increase 
theres no question were going to prevail said barnes a 
former maryland congressman bruce babbitt is a great guy but he 
didnt win the nomination babbitt like jackson promised to 
raise taxes 
the drafting committee will hold its third and final day of 
meetings sunday at this resorts grand hotel 
the full 186member platform committee meets in denver june 
2526 
rep william gray iii of philadelphia who chairs the drafting 
panel said if we can reach a strong consensus and agreement in 
the drafting committee then i think the chances of a large number 
of significant amendments in denver that potentiallay could be 
divisive and ripping of the fabric of our party will be lessened 
the same thing will be true in atlanta said gray 
gray a baptist minister left at midday to officiate at the 
wedding of a friends daughter in atlanta but planned to return 
afterwards 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons chief emissary said the tax 
dispute was perhaps the most difficult issue and perhaps the 
greatest difference between the dukakis and the jackson campaigns 
i cannot say for sure whether we will be able to work out 
compromise language 
this is a driving force in the jackson campaign otherwise we 
think the democrats risk being ridiculed for wanting to change 
priorities but having no vision of how you get the money to do 
it she said 
she said barnes comments on revenues just restated what dukakis 
has said all along one wonders if we arent already at the last 
resort weve got a deficit that keeps growing when do you get to 
the resort that is the last one we think youve got to face this 
issue now she said

a sheriffs deputy whose fingernails are a 
quarterinch over regulation was suspended for four days after she 
refused to trim them saying shes had them long all her 10 years 
on the job and they dont interfere with her work 
danielle rogers who works at the hennepin county juvenile 
center has nails that are threeeighths inch past her fingertips 
a grooming policy adopted by the sheriffs department may 16 says 
nails may not be longer than an eighth of an inch 
the policy covers a range of subjects including the length and 
style of hair personal hygiene and wearing jewelry 
rogers filed a grievance over the policy claiming it is an 
issue that should have been decided in collective bargaining 
between department officials and the deputies union she was 
suspended wednesday for a day for violating the rule and again on 
thursday this time for three days for not trimming her nails 
on friday the union filed suit against hennepin county and 
sheriff don omodt claiming that the failure to negotiate the 
policy was an unfair labor practice and that rogers was disciplined 
for exercising her right to file a grievance 
hennepin county district judge ann montgomery denied a temporary 
restraining order friday and scheduled a hearing for monday on 
whether a preliminary injunction should be issued 
omodt did not return a telephone call to the department 
saturday his home telephone is unlisted 
in an affidavit filed with the court rogers said she has had 
her nails the same length for the 10 years she has worked as a 
deputy and they do not affect her work 
the objection is not over the grooming policy said her 
attorney marshall tanick but over the failure of the county to 
bargain with the union he also said there is a right to privacy in 
personal appearance as long as it is not detrimental to the job 
another problem with the policy tanick said is that it does 
not spell out what the consequences are for violating it 
rogers has been threatened with disciplinary action up to 
dismissal according to court documents 
karla hancock assistant hennepin county attorney said friday 
there was no need to bargain about the policy because it falls 
under managements rights rather than being a term and condition 
of employment that must be negotiated 
said tanick we believe there are serious law enforcement 
issues in the county that merit attention too much time and energy 
has been devoted to this petty issue 
as long as the deputy is competentthe length of her nails 
should not matter

in china a nation that takes its political 
slogans seriously a large billboard in a provincial capital 
reading efficiency is life time is money is a dramatic sign 
of the times 
it is an indication of how communist party ideologists the 
shapers of public opinion have been backed into a corner by the 
rapid acceptance of private ownership shareholding and free 
markets all capitalistic challenges to marxistleninist doctrine 
capitalism has absorbed things from socialism now we should 
absorb some good things from capitalism said zhao yao dean of 
the communist party central committee college a training ground 
for ideologists 
capitalism was once dismissed in china as an evil opposed to 
socialism 
but we now believe that was wrong added zhao 
the official doctrines that have often forced the chinese to 
worry about whether they are being good communists have been in a 
state of flux since deng xiaoping the pragmatist famed for saying 
it doesnt matter if a cat is black or white as long as it 
catches mice came to power 10 years ago 
declaring that poverty is not socialism he dismantled mao 
tsetungs communes restored the profit motive and unleashed 
freemarket forces into a rigid system of central planning 
today the concern of most chinese is how to get better wages 
and cope with rising prices 
as long as the economy is prosperous and living standards are 
raised our purpose is fulfilled said li yining a prominent 
economist 
this month the communist party will publish its last issue of 
the journal red flag whose heavy prose has for 30 years set 
the tone for party ideology in its place the party will 
inaugurate a publication called seeking truth which is 
expected to concentrate on economic reforms and political 
democratization 
party leader zhao ziyang a major supporter of economic reforms 
announced at a party conference last fall that china will be in 
what he called the primary stage of socialism through the 
middle of the next century 
zhao told economic planners they would be allowed to adapt 
capitalist practices as long as these advanced the national goal of 
economic development party propagandists hailed zhaos 
laissezfaire approach to socialism which played down the need for 
ideology to back up policy 
the guangming daily chinas leading intellectual newspaper 
said in a recent commentary that great changes have taken place in 
the past decade 
however we cannot deny that in many places dogmatism like a 
specter still binds the peoples thinking and hampers the 
development of socialist modernization it said adding that even 
these days almost every new economic or political reform must 
still overcome suspicions of being too capitalistic 
by adopting unorthodox approaches to marxism and capitalism the 
new theorists are trying to legitimize reforms that have brought 
china television commercials promoting consumption free markets 
taking away business from state stores and millionaires with 
servants 
many of the new theorists say the ideology of karl marx who 
lived in the 19th century cannot explain the modern relationship 
between socialism and capitalism they say maos insistence on 
class struggle over economic development was a disaster for china 
leading social scientist li honglin recently wrote that the 
soviet union once chinas model as an economic system has 
failed to match the productive energy of capitalist countries 
socialism is not a cake that can be ordered and there is no 
fixed pattern for socialism li wrote 
to promote reforms we must make breakthroughs in theory 
said zhao yao dean of the party central committee college 
shareholding private ownership of property and even the 
democratic process are other western practices that can be of use 
to chinese socialism the party school theorists said 
zhao said chinas 18 million private entrepreneurs have become 
an important auxiliary part of the economy 
but the party theorists insist that china remain a socialist 
country whose vital task is to define socialism to meet the 
countrys changing needs 
reflecting this task the chinese academy of social science has 
said it will this year start a new research project the study of 
a modified form of socialism 
the head of the research team will be one of chinas most 
progressive political thinkers su shaozhi who a year ago was 
fired from his position as head of the academys marxismleninism 
institute for being too liberal

water for very long ms borakove said she was not dead for a 
very long period of time from the time they found her yesterday it 
certainly is not months whether its weeks or days i cannot pin 
it down

vanquished republican presidential candidates said 
saturday that george bush represents safe change and transition 
from the reagan era but warned gop activists it would be fatal to 
take his election for granted 
it is not for the vice president to win this election by 
himself senate minority leader bob dole told a unity 88 
conference the task is too large the stakes are too high and 
the opposition too bitter 
dole was joined by rep jack kemp rny and former secretary 
of state alexander m haig jr in seeking to rally party officials 
and activists from 16 states while bush enjoyed a oneday campaign 
respite in houston 
meanwhile bushs campaign manager lee atwater said he would 
not worry if bush continued to trail democrat michael dukakis in 
the polls because bush operates better in the underdog position 
atwater also said he believes that bush has a wellspring of 
support in florida texas the sun belt states and much of the 
west and that this translates to a core support base constituting 
210 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win 
hes constantly underestimated atwater told the party 
activists 
atwater said the possible disaffection of jesse jackson from the 
democratic cause if jackson is given shortshrift treatment in 
atlanta by dukakis offers a great opportunity for bush to 
improve his standing among minority voters 
he also said he expects bush to reap much of the support from 
democrats and independents who backed ronald reagan saying these 
voters will come back in droves when the dukakis views become 
better known 
bush has been trailing dukakis in public opinion polls 
sometimes by 15 or more percentage points but atwater noted bushs 
comeback from his loss to dole in the leadoff iowa caucuses and 
said now he operates better in the underdog position he enjoys 
it more i dont care if were behind we may be behind all along 
the former candidates coupled appeals for bush support with 
stinging denunciations of dukakis the likely democratic nominee 
somebody ought to let gov dukakis know that there is no 
owners manual for the white house said dole who during the 
campaign had accused bush of being a donothing standin for 
president reagan at ceremonial events 
kemp speaking to a luncheon audience urged bush to keep 
working to broaden the base of the party he also said the 
republicans should not concede the northeast to dukakis 
please dont write off the northeast please dont think we 
can win by knitting together some kind of electoral base from the 
sun belt and forget the northeast dont write off anybody 
he said 
haig said that bush represents safe change for america 
while dukakis would bring about radical and dangerous change 
i think america in 1988 does not want extremism of the left or 
righp zaig said 
haig said the massachusetts governor is the voice for 
discredited and disconsolate liberals and told his gop 
audience the party must work to bring back disaffected 
conservatives in its own ranks 
we know that the reagan revolution the reagan era is nearly 
over he said haig said some conservatives who supported the 
reagan cause have become disenchanted and he said the party must 
be vigilant about voters who thirst for change after seven and a 
half years 
many are beginning to nitpick at the fringes displaying 
worry about such problems as drugs and declining educational 
performance he said 
speculation about bushs likely choice as a vice presidential 
running mate hovered over this meeting popping up in lounge and 
coffeeshop talk at the hyatt regency hotel here 
during a workshop speech haig joked about suggestions that 
were all here because we all want to be on the ticket the 
former nato commander and onetime white house chief of staff for 
president nixon said im content with having made a try for the 
gop nomination 
bush has indicated he will not seriously consider whom to select 
until dukakis has made his choice known 
party chairman frank fahrenkopf urged republican activists to 
work hard for bush at the grassroots level saying that you 
dont do from a podium you dont do it with slick television ads 
and george bush will not be the next president of the united states 
unless we do it work hard 
dole said bush supporters should not be disheartened by the 
various polls showing the vice president trailing dukakis saying 
the governor had benefitted from eight weeks of primary victories 
after the gop race had essentially ended 
america likes the calm and reassuring continuity george bush 
represents dole said

iranian gunboats staged daylight attacks 
saturday on a west german freighter and a britishowned supertanker 
350 miles apart in the persian gulf one crewman died and two were 
wounded in the attacks 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
raids could easily be interpreted as a direct show of defiance 
by iran of american military might in the gulf 
a us warship was dispatched to aid the 258979ton british 
supertanker esso demetia off the saudi arabian coast after it sent 
out what a us navy spokesman called a general appeal for 
assistance

others were critically wounded when two gunboats fired on the 
11744ton german frighter dhaulagiri in the strait of hormuz 
the ship was under charter to the american presidents line ltd 
of san francisco according to shipping executives who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
as with other recent iranian forays against commercial shipping 
the raids caught the us warships patrolling the gulf out of 
position to intervene with force had they been asked to do so

friday but it was not independently confirmed 
the dhaulagiri was manned by five germans and 14 filipinos the 
shipping executives said and all the casualties were filipinos 
the executives said a man speaking with a filipino accent was 
heard on the radio calling frantically for assistance after the 
attack 
he was begging almost crying for helicopter assistance to 
remove the wounded one executive said 
they said an omani navy patrol boat responded to the distress 
call and took the injured to a hospital 
the dhaulagiri was bound for the saudi arabian port of dammam 
when attacked and it headed to dubai for repairs saturday the 
sources said 
since violence from the 8yearold iraniraq conflict spilled 
into the gulf in 1984 more than 500 merchant ships have been 
damaged or lost and more than 300 sailors killed

was the american cancer society guilty 
of boarish behavior in putting sen albert gore jrs name on a 
fundraising letter advertising its swine ball without asking him 
first 
gores name appeared as honorary chairman of saturday nights 
charity event on a mailing signed by the pig fairy and the 
onetime presidential hopeful suggested tongueinjowl that 
perhaps a federal investigation should be launched into 
unauthorized use of his name 
it is an honor to be named honorary chairman of course it 
would have been an even greater honor if they had asked me first 
he said 
gore said he learned of the letter when tennessee valley 
authority chairman marvin runyon wrote to him remarking 
frankly i am very surprised that you would allow your name to be 
used with such a boarish event 
runyon also said that in view of the fact that the number 1992 
might have some significance for gore he was sending a check for 
1992 to the swine ball 
this is a 4 reduction from last year as i think under your 
honorary leadership the event will be awful runyon joked 
gore noting that runyon actually gave 2000 last year called 
the letter shocking evidence that the chairman of the 
multimilliondollar tva cannot do simple arithmetic since the 
check is actually an 8 reduction from his previous donation 
the swine ball is a spoof of the highsociety swan ball which 
raises money for the cheekwood art museum

blue lights band as entertainment at the fundraiser where guests 
dine on hot dogs on stale buns pig knuckles beans barbecue and

soviet leaders came and went but vasily shipilov 
stayed in prison 
then came mikhail s gorbachev and now shipilov a 60yearold 
russian orthodox deacon who spent more than half his life behind 
bars is a free man 
but he is also a broken man so out of touch with his country 
that he never heard of perestroika gorbachevs system of 
reforms for the soviet union 
after 36 years in labor camps prisons and psychiatric 
hospitals shipilov was suddenly released on may 31 from a siberian 
mental hospital flown to moscow put in another psychiatric 
hospital and released friday 
many such hospitals had become notorious for being used by the 
government to jail political prisoners the diagnosis used to keep 
shipilov locked up was that he was schizophrenic 
shipilov hunched over and fraillooking limped into a moscow 
apartment saturday to face two dozen reporters and fellow 
christians an elderly woman broke down in tears at the sight of 
the brownhaired man with a drawn face and tired brown eyes 
shipilov crossed himself every time he rose to speak something 
he says he did even while locked up he had difficulty answering 
reporters questions giving rambling and confused answers 
asked what he thinks of perestroika shipilov responded i 
dont know anything about it i was in isolation 
at one point shipilov said he was put in a straitjacket and 
beaten for refusing to mop floors on a religious holiday 
hes only seen doctors hes not used to our world said 
alexander ogorodnikov a christian activist who has also been 
jailed 
we hope he is the last of the stalinera prisoners but we 
dont know for sure said ogorodnikov who introduced shipilov to 
the reporters 
there were other signs that the orthodox deacon was out of touch 
with the times 
shipilov apparently had never seen a bottle of soft drink before 
he asked if the pepsi put before him was wine 
soviet authorities gave him a passport and he plans to leave 
june 17 for britain then settle in the holy trinity russian 
orthodox seminary in jordanville ny 
the release came during the celebration of the 1000th 
anniversary of christianity in russia an event that has brought 
new focus on soviet restrictions on religious freedom 
but shipilov credits only one person for his release the rev 
dick rodgers an anglican minister from birmingham england who 
has waged a 10year campaign for the orthodox clergyman 
to draw attention to shipilovs plight the 41yearold minister 
spent 46 days during lent this year in a cage made of wood and 
chicken wire outside st martininthefields church in london he 
told saturdays news conference he had collected 36000 signatures 
on a petition demanding shipilovs release 
rodgers first met the man he helped to free at moscows 
psychiatric hospital no 7 on thursday on saturday the minister 
smiled broadly and presented shipilov with a britishmade religious 
icon and a box of chocolates 
shipilov said he was born in the southern siberian region of 
altai and was first arrested in 1949 under the leader he calls 
the communist bandit soviet dictator josef stalin 
he had been studying at an underground orthodox seminary in 
siberia 
he then spent two years in a labor camp and was released before 
being arrested again in 1954 for alleged antisoviet behavior he 
also spent time in four soviet psychiatric hospitals 
shipilov said he learned to interpret the soviet governments 
claim that it provides free medical care 
not free care but free torment he said 
i am healthy he added 
rodgers said shipilovs survival was a tribute to his faith in 
god 
gorbachevs reforms in addition to bringing changes in the 
economy have also resulted in the release of more than 140 
political and religious activists in the past few years 
soviet officials announced in january that a new law would make 
it illegal to commit a patently healthy person to a mental 
institution the government has also said that some mental 
hospitals administered by the interior ministry which controls the 
police and prisons were being transferred to the health ministry

premiers andreas papandreou of greece and 
turgut ozal of turkey open talks under tight security monday in an 
effort to cement a fragile reconciliation between the traditionally 
hostile nato allies 
ozals threeday visit to athens the first by a turkish 
premier in 36 years is the latest move to improve relations after 
a greekturkish summit at the swiss ski resort of davos in january 
we went to davos and agreed on a nowar course we havent 
ensured peace but were striving for consolidation of peace in the 
region papandreou recently told parliament 
fifteen months ago greece and turkey nearly went to war over 
oildrilling rights in the aegean in a flareup that apparently 
persuaded papandreou to change his hardline policy toward turkey 
for years the former american economics professor had rejected 
ozals offers of friendship suggesting that turkey had deeplaid 
plans to invade several greek islands near turkeys aegean coast 
papandreous antiturkish rhetoric struck a chord with greeks 
who view turkey with suspicion tinged with fear a legacy of four 
centuries of ottoman turkish rule in greece and periodic eruptions 
of violence over the past 30 years 
there were antigreek riots in turkey in the 1950s trouble 
over cyprus in the 60s and the turkish invasion of cyprus in 1974 
its hard to believe the turks really want to be friends said 
businessman ioakim papazoglou whose family used to live in turkey 
although greeks welcome the reduced tension the speed and style 
of papandreous policy switch has produced criticism from both 
conservatives and leftists 
perhaps the suddenness of davos took people by surprise but 
whats being done is a stepbystep process that will take a long 
time perhaps a decade to bear fruit said a greek diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
conservatives claim papandreou has yielded ground to turkey by 
focusing on minor issues and boosting trade rather than on the 
topics dividing the two countries 
the crucial problems they say are the disputes over sharing 
mineral rights in the aegean continental shelf and the divided 
island of cyprus 
greece wants turkey to agree on an appeal to the world court for 
a ruling on the continental shelf problem turkey would prefer the 
dispute to be solved through direct talks 
following a public outcry over his failure to raise the issue at 
his first meeting with ozal of 1619 greek cypriots missing since 
the turkish invasion papandreou says he will certainly raise the 
cyprus problem this time 
during ozals visit greek cypriots living in athens intend to 
march to the turkish embassy and lay a wreath outside parliament 
greece is disappointed that turkey hasnt withdrawn some of the 
30000 turkish troops occupying the northern third of cyprus as 
proof of its commitment to better relations 
the island was divided into greek cypriot and turkish cypriot 
sectors by the turkish invasion that followed a 1974 coup aimed at 
uniting cyprus with greece 
greece also has linked turkeys application to join the european 
economic community with cyprus papandreou has said greece would 
assist turkeys membership bid in the 12nation trade bloc if the 
cyprus problem was solved 
the two premiers will meet in the seaside suburb of vouliagmeni 
under tight security the security was stepped up following 
antiturkish demonstrations and bomb attacks against turkish 
diplomats cars during visits in may by istanbul mayor bedrettin 
dalan and turkish foreign minister mesut yilmaz

opec president rilwanu lukman on saturday 
opened the cartels 83rd meeting by urging members to set aside 
their differences and reach a production pact that would stabilize 
the floundering oil market 
only an accord based on consensus will achieve the required 
impact and send the right signals to the market lukman told the 
12 other oil ministers in his opening speech at the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries regular midyear meeting 
the meeting began after 6 pm 12 noon edt more than three 
hours late lasted two hours and adjourned until 10 am 4 am 
edt sunday 
opec will try to decide whether to change an agreement among 12 
of its 13 members to limit output to 1506 million barrels a day 
the agreement which was extended in december and expires june 30 
was designed to support oil prices at 18 a barrel 
iraq did not join in the pact insisting on a quota equal to 
iran the two nations have been at war since september 1980 
lukman nigerias oil minister was elected opec president for 
another six months in a vote taken at the start of the first 
session he assumed the post in june 1986 and has been reelected 
at every meeting since then 
fernando santosalvite ecuadors oil minister was reelected 
vice president 
pessimism about the possibility of the cartel reaching agreement 
on a new accord has depressed the oil markets pushing prices well 
below the target 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil fell 52 cents to 1585 a barrel on 
friday west texas intermediate the us benchmark crude dropped 
42 cents to 16865 on the spot market 
a venezuelaled group has wanted to cut production to push oil 
prices up while saudi arabia leads other opec members who want to 
raise output or at least hold it steady to maintain the cartels 
market share 
industry analysts believe opec is so deeply divided that it will 
extend its current agreement for three or six months 
but late saturday venezuela appeared to have softened its 
position 
its oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti said i am not 
sure we have the unanimity to reduce the production level 
anyway if we maintain the current level of production i 
believe that prices will start going back up because of an 
expected increase in demand in the second half of the year 
saudi arabia has wanted to increase oil output to take advantage 
of that anticipated increase in demand 
the iraniraq war remains a major problem 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqhazadeh said his country 
couldnt guarantee that it would continue to accept a quota which 
currently stands at 2369 million barrels a day if iraq which is 
producing 26 million barrels a day continued to refuse to accept 
a quota

moreconservative 200member house of representatives 
it also would have to be approved by president corazon aquino 
who has veto power 
us policy is not to confirm or deny the existence of nuclear 
weapons in specific places 
in his talk quinn said nuclear weapons for all their 
destructive effects have kept peace better than anything else in 
history 
noting that this country has battled a communist insurgency for 
19 years now quinn said filipinos should not fear nuclear 
weapons but the increasing prospect of communism 
filipinos have the right to be worried but not of nuclear 
weapons but of the prospects of radical communism which has 
destroyed religion in several countries the diplomat said

jesse jackson said saturday he will continue 
seeking delegates to boost his strength at the democratic national 
convention where he wants a laundry list of issues included in the 
partys platform 
jackson whose 1988 presidential prospects evaporated when 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis clinched the democratic 
nomination last tuesday announced his plan in an hourlong speech 
before about 1200 singing cheering applauding supporters at the 
chicago headquarters of operation push the civil rights group he 
founded 
were going to atlanta with the ability to help shape the 
platform jackson said jesse is working on solidifying the 
rainbow coalition movement and unifying the democratic party 
he said he would announce specifics of his plans within the next 
week or so 
jackson said he would spend a significant amount of time before 
the july convention pursing the support of super delegates the 
643 party leaders and politicians who received seats as delegates 
because of their posts 
jackson has won support from just 54 super delegates while 347 
are backing dukakis according to the associated press delegate 
count the rest are uncommitted 
the issues which jackson wants to become part of the partys 
platform include achieving statehood for the district of columbia 
getting congress to declare south africa a terrorist state and 
establishing a program of national health care 
jackson again staked his claim to the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket which he says should be offered to him because 
of his second place finish in the race for the partys presidential 
nomination on saturday he said his experience in foreign policy 
would strengthen a ticket with dukakis 
dukakis says he wants a vice president with foreign policy 
experience well jackson said pausing to an ovation 
with relations eased between the united states and the soviet 
union the most critical foreign policy issues and conflicts are in 
the developing world said jackson 
the selection of the vice president could be used to give 
someone with third world experience and sensitivity a chance 
jackson said 
jackson said he was not interested in a cabinet post saying 
an appointment position is also a disappointment position a vice 
presidential position is a constitutional position from which you 
cannot be fired because youre elected by the people 
jackson said however that if he were asked to be the vice 
presidential nominee acceptance would not be automatic 
its a matter that my family must wrestle with i must wrestle 
with personally its a decision i will make at the time 
the fundamental question right now is our constituency has 
earned serious consideration for the vice presidential 
nomination he said surely based upon the tone weve set the 
votes weve delivered the elections weve won the general mandate 
weve gotten from the american people has earned us serious 
consideration

the rev billy graham brought his impassioned 
brand of preaching to a church packed with russian orthodox 
believers on saturday but the evangelists fireandbrimstone 
delivery failed to ignite his listeners 
grahams appearance was part of this communist countrys 
celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the arrival of 
christianity 
some things change some things never change graham told 
the crowd gathered in the 17thcentury church of our lady of kazan 
at kolomenskoye in southern moscow god never changes human 
nature never changes 
your liturgy is based on the bible and the bible says that 
the world will be shaken from time to time graham said clearly 
alluding to the social changes that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev is attempting through his reforms 
graham a southern baptist evangelist was in moscow as part of 
the officially sanctioned celebration of the introduction of 
christianity into russia by prince vladimir of kiev in 988 
grahams englishlanguage sermon was translated into russian by 
the rev vladimir sorokin head of the russian orthodox seminary in 
the northern russian city of leningrad 
the soviet congregation reacted coolly to grahams sermon only 
waving their hands when he asked at one point if they were happy a 
few clapped politely as he was driven away from the church in a 
governmentowned black chaika 
it was strange one woman told another as the worshipers 
filed from the church and mingled with those who had not been able 
to find room inside 
blueshirted uniformed police officers were scattered at the 
edge of the grounds but made no move to interfere with the 
proceedings 
soviet authorities brutally repressed the church in the years 
after the 1917 bolshevik revolution especially under josef v 
stalin jailing or killing many priests and nationalizing church 
property 
until recently police surrounded churches on such religious 
holidays as easter allowing only the elderly to enter 
under gorbachev the state has returned to the church the 
monastery of the caves in kiev agreed to build an oldage home for 
priests and promised to liberalize a 1929 law which sanctioned 
suppression of the church 
in another sign of relaxation authorities on friday released a 
russian orthodox deacon vasily shipilov who spent 36 of his 60 
years in psychiatric prisons 
signals that authorities will moderate constraints on the church 
have aroused mixed reactions among visiting clergymen 
graham who said during a 1982 visit that he thought the church 
in the soviet union was free this time said only that the people 
seem to be warmer that makes me glad according to his 
spokesman edward e plowman graham did not speak with reporters 
at saturdays service 
cardinal john oconnor of new york said friday i think anyone 
in his right mind prays that mr gorbachev is sincere and wants to 
bring about a new era 
oconnor the highestranking american in the largest vatican 
delegation ever to visit the soviet union was scheduled to attend 
an evening religious vigil saturday night 
that service is in preparation for the celebration sunday of one 
of the holiest dates on the russian orthodox calendar known as 
sunday of all the saints who shone forth in the land of russia 
soviet president andrei a gromyko whose prominence in the 
soviet government dates to the stalin era met saturday at the 
kremlin with foreign religious dignitaries who are in moscow for 
the church millennium 
gromyko assured his guests that authorities were working quickly 
to redraft the law on religion to guarantee greater tolerance of 
believers the official tass news agency said

about 5000 roman catholics packed 
st vitus cathedral on saturday for the consecration of two 
assistant bishops the first such appointments allowed by communist 
authorities since 1973 
catholics seized the opportunity to show their support for 
defiant cardinal frantisek tomasek the archbishop of prague and 
the catholic primate of czechoslovakia 
after the ceremony hundreds of believers massed at the entrance 
to the archbishops palace shouting we want religious 
freedom long live father cardinal and long live the 
pope 
tomasek has come under strong attack from staterun news media 
this year for supporting a petition for more religious freedom 
which has been signed by an estimated 600000 people 
saturdays ceremony was the first public consecration of 
assistant bishops in prague in 55 years and was marked by repeated 
calls for more bishops denied by the communist regime 
tomasek officiated at what was a major church gathering to 
celebrate the formal appointment of jan lebeda the 75yearold 
vicar general of prague and 64yearold antonin liska as assistant 
bishops of prague 
the state was represented by minister of education milan 
kymlicka and officials of the state church authority but not by 
vladimir janku the head of the department 
the first churchman to speak was parish priest karel otcenasek 
from trmice in northern bohemia who was consecrated as bishop in 
1951 at age 29 but was never permitted by the authorities to take 
up office 
in his address frequently interrupted by applause otcenasek 
assured the cardinal you feel the difficulties and fears of us 
all the church in our country speaks in a single voice and 
that comes out of your mouth 
in april the cardinal wrote to premier lubomir strougal urging 
that the church and the authorities open a new dialogue the offer 
was rejected amid indications the communist party is reinforcing 
its atheist drive

the beginning of further consecrations of bishops nine dioceses 
have been waiting a long number of years for their diocesan 
bishops 
ten bishoprics in all have been reported to be vacant tomaseks 
mentioning nine apparently has to do with one bishopric being greek 
orthodox 
the event was attended by bishops from poland east germany 
west germany and austria 
after the ceremony papal emissary archbishop francesco 
colasuonno addressed the congregation in czech assuring the 
faithful of church solidarity

us commerce secretary c william 
verity on saturday said that massive western loans to the soviet 
bloc could backfire without fundamental changes in the easts 
economic system 
verity said on the final day of the threeday eastwest 
conference that large increases in western lending might boost 
living standards in the east at least for awhile but such 
lending does not generate the means of future repayment 
there are massive systematic failings that can only be solved 
by changing the system itself by a repudiation of rigid 
centrallyplanned monopolies and a move toward meaningful prices 
and decentralized enterprise he said 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher also 
told the conference on eastwest security that the two german 
nations bear a special responsibility for reuniting europe 
verity urged the east to strive for currency convertibility by 
1995 so the soviet union and its allies could do business in 
international markets using their own currencies 
currency convertibility is the necessary act for the eastern 
economies to join the world economy verity said 
he also criticized the human rights situation in the east bloc 
especially targeting the conference host country east germany 
traveling to potsdam most of us drove through checkpoints in 
the berlin wall and saw armed guards at the ready restrictions on 
freedom of movement and conscience are still daily facts of life 
verity said 
genschers speech marked the first time a west german leader of 
genschers rank made an official address in east germany 
genscher who left east germany in 1952 made several references 
to world war ii as well as to atrocities that occurred during adolf 
hitlers rule of germany 
it is obvious that we germans bear a special responsibility 
for overcoming the division of our continent genscher said 
the bitter experiences of this century prompt those nations to 
keep a watchful eye on us germans 
genscher spoke out strongly for a common european house 
we germans must render a major contribution to building 
confidence between east and west we want to reactivate the once 
so varied and fruitful bonds between germans and russians we want 
to develop and deepen them with the aim of overcoming the division 
in europe genscher said 
genscher also praised the reforms of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and rejected any suggestion that increased eastwest 
cooperation could decouple the european allies

sen edward m kennedy pronounced george bush a dead duck in 
the presidential race even as the vice presidents campaign 
manager and former gop rivals said saturday they werent alarmed by 
his weakness in the polls 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said he is not worried yet 
about democrat michael dukakis lead in the polls saying bush 
operates better in the underdog position 
he enjoys it more atwater said i dont care if were 
behind we may be behind all along 
bush and dukakis both of whom are assured of winning their 
parties presidential nominations this summer stayed close to home 
saturday the vice president took the day off in houston while the 
massachusetts governor was in boston for his home states 
democratic convention 
democrat jesse jackson also kept to home turf saturday with an 
hourlong speech in chicago to supporters at operation push the 
civil rights group he founded jackson repeated his claim he should 
be offered the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket and said he 
would continue gathering delegates to force the party to accept his 
issues as part of its platform 
were going to atlanta with the ability to help shape the 
platform jackson said jesse is working on solidifying the 
rainbow coalition movement and unifying the democratic party 
atwater was attending a unity 88 conference in denver 
where party leaders from western states heard bushs vanquished gop 
rivals urge them to help defeat dukakis 
it is not for the vice president to win this election by 
himself senate minority leader bob dole told the conference 
the task is too large the stakes are too high and the opposition 
too bitter 
dole the winner of the republican caucuses in iowa said he has 
been wary of polls since his own loss to bush in the new hampshire 
primary 
when he looks at the dukakis poll numbers dole said i think 
of new hampshire and i think of my pollster god bless his soul 
i remember coming into the hotel one day whistling hail to 
the chief but i was the only one there dole said 
but massachusetts democrats were crowing about the political 
strength their homestate candidate was showing in the public 
opinion polls some of which have dukakis leading bush by as many 
as 15 percentage points 
president dukakis it has a nice ring doesnt it kennedy 
said in his speech to the state convention 
some people say dont count your chickens before theyre 
hatched kennedy said well i say the republicans have already 
hatched their chicken in this campaign and george bush is a dead 
duck 
you have made me what i am and i am eternally grateful 
dukakis told his state convention nobody has been blessed more 
than i 
but dukakis who has been criticized for a lack of experience in 
foreign policy was taking heat saturday for his suggestion earlier 
in the week that the united states should move its embassy in 
israel from tel aviv to jerusalem 
israel declared its capital to be jerusalem after seizing the 
eastern part of the city from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
but the united states and most other nations continue to keep their 
embassies in tel aviv 
dukakis said us embassies should be placed where the host 
nation says its capital is 
dukakis was quickly criticized by secretary of state george p 
shultz and on saturday arab league spokesman clovis maksoud said 
if the governor was indicating the course of his foreign policy 
then the uss future role in assisting to bring about a just 
peace in the middle east will further erode and will be seriously 
jeopardized 
and jerusalem mayor teddy kollek dismissed dukakis statement as 
just electionyear rhetoric 
it happens every time kollek said saturday on israeli 
radio jerusalem is a controversial issue and therefore 
everybody will try to exploit this in order to attract votes 
meanwhile democrats drafting the partys platform clashed over 
whether to include a call for raising taxes on the rich the 
proposed plank is backed by jacksons supporters and opposed by the 
dukakis forces who want to keep talk of raising taxes out of the 
party platform 
michael barnes dukakiss top emissary to the platform 
committee said the democratic platform in 1988 is not going to 
call for a tax increase 
theres no question were going to prevail said barnes a 
former maryland congressman bruce babbitt is a great guy but he 
didnt win the nomination babbitt had said he would raise taxes 
the drafting committee would hold its third and final day of 
meetings sunday on mackinac island a posh resort nestled between 
michigans upper and lower peninsulas 
also on saturday former vice president walter mondale the 
democrats 1984 presidential nominee announced his endorsement of 
dukakis praising him as a brilliant gifted public servant 
blessed with a sense of compassion 
in a letter to the minnesota democratic convention mondale said 
dukakis is the person who can bring our party together and wage a 
strong campaign based on our shared democratic values

jesse jacksons halfbrother noah robinson has 
operated chicago companies that have capitalized on programs to aid 
minority businesses but has often hired whiteowned firms to do 
the work a newspaper reports 
robinson 45 who faces criminal charges in south carolina said 
saturday that subcontracting is common in the construction industry 
and contends he did nothing wrong 
robinson was arrested last weekend in his hometown of 
greenville sc on charges that he hired someone to attack a 
murder witness last dec 4 in greenville the witness janice 
rosemond who survived five stab wounds was to testify in 
connection with the 1986 murder of leroy barber a former robinson 
employee 
the chicago tribune reported in sundays editions that in 
several instances a company owned by robinson was awarded contracts 
aimed at minority firms but then contracted the work to others 
robinson reached by telephone saturday at the chicago office of 
his precision contractors inc said we have not been found 
wanting by any agency in any investigation 
robinson free on bond also said he had no reason to harm ms 
rosemond 
she looks at me as if im a fatherly figure he said ive 
known her and her mother all their lives 
he maintained that authorities are after him partly to hurt 
jacksons bid for president 
robinson said he last saw barber when he and barber got into a 
fight in december 1985 about a month before barber was killed 
he had enough enemies anybody could have killed him 
robinson said 
robinson also charged that authorities timed his arrest in 
greenville to make me appear to be the achilles heel of jesses 
campaign 
he said he has not contacted jackson recently and has not played 
an active role in the campaign my efforts have been strictly 
that of a wellwisher he said 
jackson has declined comment on robinsons arrest 
precision contractors was formed in 1979 by robinson who is 
black and paschen contractors inc a whiteowned firm 
the newspaper said state records and interviews show nearly 
every aspect of the work on a granite ramp in chicagos state of 
illinois center awarded to precision under a state program for 
minorities was subcontracted to a whiteowned firm wolverine 
marble co of detroit 
in 1979 the metropolitan sanitary district found that the work 
on a 43 million minority contract obtained by robinsonrun apache 
electric co and a whiteowned firm tunnel electric co was done 
by tunnel employees the newspaper said 
two years later the tribune said precision got a 23 million 
sanitary district subcontract for work on deep tunnel a giant 
pollution control project but farmed virtually all of the work to 
other firms 
all general managers and construction managers contract work 
out to specialty trades robinson said we subcontract to other 
specialty contractors whether they be white or black or green or 
blue 
if im a general contractor who just happens to be black why 
cant i conduct myself like other general contractors who happen to 
be white 
the tribune said precision did not get minority business 
contracts from the city of chicago because city officials concluded 
in 1980 that the white partners controlled the firm 
but robinson said the citys conclusion was wrong and precision 
successfully appealed 
we are certified now he said 
the newspaper said that in march 1981 paschen contractors sold 
its 2500 shares of precision to the company for 3 million 
frank paschen who retained an interest in precision sued two 
years later charging that robinson had siphoned more than 16 
million from the firm the tribune said the case was settled after 
robinson paid frank paschen 1 million the newspaper said 
robinson said the charges by paschen were unsubstantiated and he 
used the opportunity to buy out paschen and another former partner 
it was like a divorce he said

sixteen members of the soviet academy of sciences 
have resigned simultaneously as authorities press a campaign to 
bring new blood into the prestigious institution tass said 
saturday 
the official soviet news agency said it was the largest mass 
resignation in the history of the 900member moscowbased academy 
which traces its roots to peter the greats creation of a russian 
academy of sciences in 1724 
the academicians terms normally would not have expired until 
1990 their departure appeared clearly linked to a drive led by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to enlist soviet scientific 
apparatus in his drive for scientific and technological progress 
that step is seen as crucial if gorbachevs campaign for 
perestroika or economic and social restructuring is to 
succeed 
lev semyonov head of the academys personnel department told 
tass the scientists mass resignation was prompted by a desire to 
draw young and talented organizers of science into the 
reorganization process more actively 
among those who resigned was anatoly alexandrov who was academy 
president until he was replaced in october 1986 by guri marchuk 
alexandrov was named a counselor of the academys presidium or 
government body tass said 
six other men who had served as secretaries of various branches 
in the academy also asked to be relieved of their duties and made 
counselors for reasons of age tass said 
elections to fill the vacancies will be held before june 20 
tass said 
a rujuvenation process in the academy began in december when 
255 new academicians and lesserranking corresponding members were 
elected at a twoday meeting of the academys membership 
many newcomers were from 40 to 45 years old 
new rules were put into effect last year requiring academicians 
to retire at age 75 
semyonov said the renewal of personnel in the academy would go 
on tass reported he said 20 directors three deputy directors 
and 160 heads of subdivisions still hold their positions despite 
their advanced age 
the academy in the past has jealously guarded its integrity even 
at the risk of incurring political displeasure it insists on 
holding its elections by secret ballot when other soviet 
organizations vote by a public show of hands 
physicist and human rights activist andrei d sakharov an 
academy member was stripped of state honors and privileges after 
becoming active in the soviet dissident movement of the 1970s but 
academy members refused to oust him and he kept his title of 
academician even after being exiled to gorky in 1980 
in december 1986 sakharov 67 was allowed to return to moscow 
to resume his research work in physics

for the first time in 20 years theres a 
tight race in the 5th congressional district to fill the seat of 
the late rep dan daniel a democrat who voted often with 
conservative republicans 
both republican linda arey and democrat lf payne jr have 
tried to portray themselves as the right kind of conservative for 
the district described by officials of both parties as one of the 
countrys most oldfashioned 
the contest has featured broadcast and campaigntrail 
mudslinging a novelty for the district and one neither side 
predicted will work when voters go to the polls in tuesdays 
special election 
often the disputes have centered on what daniel who died last 
january would have thought of the race 
the arey campaign proudly pointed to an interview late last year 
in which daniel referred to her as his ideological soul mate 
the payne camp has accused ms arey of trying to put words in a 
dead mans mouth by parlaying that comment into an apparent 
endorsement 
areys campaign denies the charge 
im sure if they had the same quote they would use it arey 
campaign manager jeff butzke said 
about a week before the election rep stan parris the 8th 
district republican went so far as to say he was absolutely 
conviced that if dan daniel were alive today he would be here 
supporting linda arey 
that did not sit well with 5th district democrats who said 
neither ms arey nor payne will ever match daniels superb 
political ability to please people from each party daniel was a 
lifelong democrat who worked his way up from the textile mills yet 
voted often with conservative republicans 
as the campaign wound down daniels son jimmie had harsh 
words about the use of his fathers name 
i continue to hear and read from various sources what my 
father dan daniel would be doing if he were alive today jimmie 
daniel said in a statement much of what is being said and 
written is completely contrary to his view as i knew it i think it 
is unjust and insensitive for a candidate or campaign to speak as 
if dan daniel had or would have endorsed them 
the fact is he had not endorsed any candidate for his house 
seat it was his way to seek office on his own merit and i am sure 
that he would prefer that his successor be elected on theirs 
ms areys latest television ads said it was time for voters to 
continue the 5th districts conservative legacy of daniel 
payne has said that as a successful developer he is better 
qualified to handle the district 
each side has lined up strong partisan support 
ms arey who formerly worked in several posts with the reagan 
administration has the president speaking for her on radio spots 
she also lined up latecampaign appearances by former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole and vice president george 
bush who will be the republican presidential nominee as well as 
several gop congressmen 
payne has gotten the nod from the commonwealths democratic 
establishment stumping for payne have been gov gerald baliles 
lt gov douglas wilder attorney general mary sue terry and house 
speaker al philpott 
both sides have predicted a close race and observers have said 
there will perhaps be a rematch in novembers general election

built it into a prowestern and anticommunist force 
in the name of liberty he was a proclaimed enemy and always 
fought against all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism

care education and taxation he also presided over a period of 
economic prosperity

problems and political uncertainty 
saragat was a scholar fond of roman philosophers and relaxed 
about politics 
he once told a political leader who had waited to see him i 
am sorry for keeping you waiting so long but i was engaged in a 
talk with italian poet salvatore quasimodo poetry should come 
before politics sometimes dont you think 
his political life was not always tranquil when he returned to 
italy from exile in 1943 he was arrested because of his 
antifascism and imprisoned by the nazis he escaped was 
recaptured and escaped a second time together with sandro pertini 
who also later became president 
after the war saragat was ambassador to france and then 
president of the provisional assembly in 1946 that framed the new 
constitution

university degree in economics and commerce he worked as a bank 
clerk and for a newspaper and wrote political books under the pen 
name togaraso 
he was elected to parliament four times and served three times 
as deputy premier saragat supported the socialistchristian 
democrat alliance that governed italy during six of his seven years 
as president 
saragat engineered the merging of his party with the bigger 
socialist party in 1966 but when the unified party took a beating 
in the 1968 elections the two again separated 
the social democrats are partners with the christian democrats 
socialists republicans and liberals in the governing coalition

oliver north wanted to use anglican church 
envoy terry waite to lure libyas col moammar gadhafi to his 
tripoli compound to increase chances gadhafi would be killed in the 
1986 us attack according to book excerpts published in us news 
amp world report 
the plan was considered and rejected and north had to be 
content with drafting a white house statement to be released in the 
event gadhafi was killed which would call his death 
fortuitous according to the account 
the book best laid plans the inside story of americas war 
against terrorism was written by david martin pentagon 
correspondent for cbs and john walcott national security 
correspondent for the wall street journal 
it looks at the events surrounding the april 15 1986 us 
bombing raid on libya which american officials said were conducted 
in response to libyas role in the bombing of a west berlin disco 
frequented by us servicemen 
according to the book north then a national security council 
aide planned to ask waite to go to tripoli on april 14 to meet 
with gadhafi waite the hostage negotiator from the church of 
england would ask gadhafis help in freeing the hostages in 
lebanon waite would then depart leaving gadhafi to spend the 
night at his compound the book said 
waite himself now believed a hostage in lebanon would not be 
told that he was being used to set gadhafi up for a killing the 
book said 
such an assassination plot would have violated american law 
previous published reports have said that north and others on the 
national security council plotted the bombing libya as a way of 
assassinating gadhafi 
us officials have said the bombing was not an assassination 
plot although they have conceded that officials wouldnt have 
been upset if gadhafi had been killed 
the book excerpted in the magazines june 20 issue also 
reports that north was so eager to get gadhafi that he doctored 
the intelligence section of an action memo prepared for 
president reagan north wanted reagan to think that a second libyan 
raid would be more successful than the intelligence community or 
the pentagon believed according to the excerpts which did not 
provide further elaboration 
the bombing mission known by the code name operation el 
dorado canyon had among its targets a frogman school a tripoli 
airfield and the compound that contained gadhafis militarystaff 
headquarters and family home some bombs fell on civilian areas 
and one us f111 bomber never returned its twoman crew later 
declared killed in action 
gadhafi was apparently unharmed although there were rumors that 
the attack had left him confused and disoriented libyan officials 
reported that his 15month old adopted daughter was killed and two 
young sons were wounded 
cbs reported saturday that after gadhafi survived the first 
attack north immediately came up with another plan to kill him 
under that plan north wanted to have an unidentified friendly 
foreign leader telephone gadhafi so that us officials could 
monitor the conversation and pinpoint his location cbs said that 
plan too was rejected by administration officials the report 
said 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel has since retired 
from the military and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from 
the diversion of profits to the nicaragua rebels from us arms 
sales to iran he was fired from his nsc job in november 1986 when 
the diversion became public

french voters on sunday choose a new national 
assembly that either will give president francois mitterrand a 
socialist majority or force him to continue cohabitation with 
the right 
five weeks after mitterrand won reelection with a solid 54 
percent of the vote over conservative former premier jacques 
chirac the socialist position appeared to be eroding and what once 
was seen as a leftist landslide in the assembly voting has become a 
contest 
the socialists recently talked about giving away constituencies 
to centrists as part of their opening to nonsocialists but 
they now are fighting for every seat and acknowledging the 
possiblity of defeat 
despite polling fewer popular votes nationwide than 
conservatives in the first round the socialists are given the edge 
to win a majority in the assembly because of peculiarities in the 
spread of their support 
publication of polls is prohibited by law in the week before an 
election but unpublished surveys indicate a socialist advantage 
in the first round of the legislative elections on june 5 the 
socialists won 40 of the 577 seats in the assembly and the 
communists won one on the right the conservative rally for the 
republic and centerright union for french democracy won 77 seats 
and minor rightist parties four 
sundays runoffs are being held in the 453 districts where no 
candidate won a majority in the first round in addition a first 
round is being held for two seats in french polynesia 
in districts where no candidate won a majority in the first 
round all candidates with 125 percent or more were eligible for 
the runoff 
as they have done in past years the socialist party and the 
communist party agreed to support the leading leftist candidate in 
districts where the socialist candidate was ahead the communist 
candidate withdrew and vice versa 
the event of the week was the traditional rights similar deal 
with the extreme right national front the party accused by nearly 
all political leaders of being racist and xenophobic though 
involving only a small number of seats the left immediately seized 
on the issue and accused the rally for the republic and union for 
french democracy of signing a pact with the devil 
for jeanmarie le pens national front its the difference 
between being shut out of the national assembly altogether and 
winning some seats for the traditional right it could be the 
difference between being in power or in the opposition 
the rally for the republic and union for french democracy denied 
there was any deal with the national front 
from 1981 to 1986 the socialists had absolute power in 1986 
after the national assemblys fiveyear term expired the right won 
a slim majority but because mitterrand had two years left on his 
sevenyear term the right and the left were forced into 
cohabitation or powersharing 
the politicians hated cohabitation but numerous polls indicated 
voters liked the balance of power between the right and the left 
analysts said mitterrands score was due to his personal 
popularity and not necessarily an indication french voters want a 
return to leftist policies on the other hand his solid victory 
did create a certain momentum 
the president said recently he thought it unhealthy for one 
party to have all the power in france nonetheless sensing his 
party was in trouble he went on national television thursday to 
ask voters to give him a clear majority with which to work in 
parliament 
as in the presidential campaign not much attention has been 
paid to the issues with all of the talk focusing on the 
opening and the national front little concrete has been said 
about unemployment social security or education 
the french may be tired of voting turnout during last weeks 
first round was 6574 percent a postwar low

entertainers from the bee gees to stevie wonder 
denounced south african apartheid saturday and honored jailed black 
leader nelson mandela in the biggest charity rock concert since the 
1985 live aid extravaganza 
more than 70000 fans jammed londons wembley stadium for the 
nearly 11hourlong concert in honor of mandelas 70th birthday on 
july 18 
they clapped sang danced and reveled in the sights and sounds 
of some of the worlds top pop musicians playing together until 
nearly 10 pm 5 pm edt 
steve sager 29 from los angeles said he timed his british 
vacation for the concert just being here to me is important 
south africa is an unjust situation all around people just 
look at it and they turn away 
for a finale american opera singer jessye norman sang amazing 
grace a cappella and firecrackers shot into the sky in a circle 
around the stadium 
the finale was a change from the expected nkosi sikelele 
africa god bless africa the national anthem of several african 
states is also regarded as the anthem of the outlawed african 
national congress the main guerrilla group fighting south africas 
government 
there was no immediate explanation for the change 
mandela a leader of the anc was sentenced in 1964 along with 
seven others to life in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to 
topple the government modeled on live aids global jukebox 
which raised money for starving africans the antiapartheid 
concert was beamed by radio and television to an estimated 750 
million people in 60 countries including the united states and the 
soviet union organizers said 
britains antiapartheid movement which organized the concert 
for mandela said half the expected 339 million in proceeds will 
go to antiapartheid activities in britain and the rest will go to 
to seven childrens charities in southern africa tickets cost 45 
the british broadcasting corp said it was covering the concert 
not as a political but as a musical event but it broadcast opening 
comments that attacked south africas policy of apartheid under 
which the nations black majority has no voice in national affairs 
among the performers were george michael roberta flack stevie 
wonder joe cocker whitney houston phil collins the eurythmics 
the bee gees wet wet wet dire straits hugh masekela miriam 
makeba salif keita and sting 
kicking off the show singeractor harry belafonte called 
mandela the leader of south africas oppressed black people and 
a symbol of the fight against the cruel and unjust system of 
apartheid 
we salute you nelson mandela and we want to see you and your 
fellow political prisoners freed belafonte declared 
the mostly youthful crowd cheered and sang happy birthday 
some waved placards one showed a black hand clasped with a white 
hand another showed a broken chain around a black mans neck 
antiapartheid banners festooned the stage which was dominated 
by a huge portrait of mandela behind bars 
british idol sting the first performer sang his hit free 
free set them free and the bbcs commentator robert denselow 
referred to mandela as a man politically imprisoned in south 
africa 
sir richard attenborough director of the antiapartheid film 
cry freedom called mandela a man of unshakeable principle 
and extraordinary courage 
fans danced on their seats climbed onto the shoulders of 
others and at times the entire throng swayed to the sounds from 
the stage 
at one point the crowd was asked to clasp hands in a mandela 
tribute they did so creating a sea of upraised arms 
scotland yard said no violent incidents were reported during the 
concert but the police headquarters said equipment belonging to 
singer stevie wonder was stolen the theft delayed his appearance 
by three hours and reduced his performance from a scheduled 50 
minutes to about 15 
the concert launched five weeks of rallies and celebrations in 
honor of mandela 
south african ambassador rae killen complained the bbcs 
broadcast aids the anc which south africa regards as a terrorist 
organization 
the bbc said it paid no money for the broadcasting rights and 
was covering the concert only because it was an outstanding 
international musical event 
but rightwing british politicians complained that the publicly 
funded bbc was violating its duty of impartiality 
the whole thing is a gigantic con trick to make people believe 
the anc is a respectable organization and not a bunch of 
gangsters said conservative lawmaker john carlisle 
anc president oliver tambo was billed by organizers as the 
concerts guest of honor 
richard caborn secretary the opposition labor partys 
antiapartheid group denied the charges of liberal bias leveled 
against the bbc

tipplers with a thirst for treasure got a chance 
saturday to bid at an auction of bottles of scotch and champagne 
recovered from a great lakes shipwreck 75 years ago 
susie shaw bought her dad some scotch whisky for a fathers day 
present three bottles that had been slowly vintaging in the cool 
waters of lake huron since the ss regina went down on nov 9 
1913 
it tastes very good said ms shaw of chicago who paid 180 
for the bottles of whyte amp mackay scotch whiskey and sampled some 
of the lakebed booze at a preauction tasting session its a 
novelty my father is a scotch drinker 
so far about 300 bottles of french champagne and scotch whisky 
have been salvaged from the regina one of 19 ships that went down 
in the great november storm 
several thousand more bottles still rest under 80 feet of water 
roughly 3 miles offshore from port sanilac about 80 miles 
northeast of detroit said commercial diver wayne brusate 
brusate accidentally discovered the wreck in july 1986 while 
searching for a tugboat that sank in the late 1960s 
i was surprised to find the cases of liquor said brusate 
of marysville mich most freighters on the great lakes carried 
coal iron ore and tons of wheat but this was like a general 
store 
the regina a 249foot canadian freighter went down with all 27 
crew members during one of the worst storms in great lakes history 
you can buy scotch anywhere but only here can you buy it from 
the lake bottom said deanna chan president of freedom marine 
ltd of vancouver british columbia the ships salvagers its a 
piece of our history a collectors item

been recovered so far 
the search will concentrate on finding the ships safe which 
reportedly contained 86000 in gold coins worth at least 2 
million at current bullion prices ms chan said the gold was 
believed to have been the payroll for workers building the sault 
ste marie locks in michigans upper peninsula 
when the salvaging work is completed the wreck could yield a 
treasure worth about 5 million she said

former white house spokesman larry speakes 
said saturday the media is doing a poor job of covering the 
presidential campaign focusing more attention on theatrics than on 
issues 
voters want more meat and potatoes on the election and the 
press is simply not giving that to them speakes said the 
press is giving all mood music and no lyrics the coverage is very 
superficial 
speakes addressing the mississippi association of broadcasters 
said the media is dead wrong on presidential handicapping 
dont ever go to the race track with a political reporter 
he told the broadcasters 
speakes was president reagans spokesman for six years he 
recently lost his job at merrill lynch in the wake of publicity 
generated by his admission in his book speaking out that he 
had concocted quotes he attributed to the president 
speakes said the weakness in television election coverage is its 
failure to tell voters the candidates plans 
television news is giving a hybrid of charisma and fact 
speakes said and thats not good enough too much is at stake 
in its coverage of jesse jackson speakes said the media has 
been lavishing its attention on his charisma not his specific 
plans there is a schizophrenia in television coverage between 
giving information or entertainment

and gaza strip 
the resolution said israel has ruled the occupied territories 
with a repressive policy it also asks the united states to end aid 
that subsidizes israeli settlements in the occupied territory

action on less controversial issues facing the denomination while 
decisions were pending on major statements on nuclear war health 
care and election of a top officer 
while the general assembly began receiving committee reports a 
fourmember writing team met behind closed doors to draft a 
preliminary recommendation on christian obedience in a nuclear 
age 
the team is working from a paper written last year after a 
fiveyear study which has drawn widespread criticism within the 3 
millionmember denomination for its discussions of tax resistance 
and the immorality of nuclear war and nuclear deterrence 
the writing group which was joined by the two leaders of the 
originating task force reworked the papers lengthy policy 
statements and background to incorporate changes the report will

seven candidates including the current stated clerk the rev james 
e andrews but declined to nominate him

a recommendation for a voluntary fund for obedience to higher 
authority to offer assistance to resisters 
on friday the 18member subcommittee retained language in the 
paper that calls nuclear war immoral but it changed a section 
labeling the theory of nuclear deterrence immoral to read nuclear 
deterrence as an end in itself is immoral 
the rev arnold come a former seminary president who helped 
write the original report and sat in on the writing committee said 
he expected some deleted portions would be restored before the 
report went to the assembly floor tuesday 
a committee also adopted a resolution to provide all delegates 
to the assembly with letters to sign and send to secretary of state 
george p shultz urging him to work to release us and other 
hostages held in lebanon

president daniel ortega on saturday 
blamed the reagan administration for the breakdown of peace talks 
with usbacked rebels but said his government was prepared to 
resume negotiations 
ortega told a group of factory workers in managua that the 
united states was seeking to make dust of the peace plan to burn 
it incinerate it 
he claimed that rebel leaders met in washington with elliott 
abrams assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
several days before last weeks three days of negotiations to work 
out a strategy to kill the peace plan 
but he said his sandinista government is prepared to continue 
discussing outstanding points in the negotiating process with the 
rebels 
both the sandinistas and rebels appear to be pegging their peace 
proposals on washingtons reaction after the collapse on thursday 
of the latest round of talks 
it is believed the sandinistas hope to achieve a peace pact with 
the rebels known as contras before the reagan administration 
leaves office next year president reagan is a strong backer of the 
contras and a peace agreement could dim if not eliminate prospects 
for renewed us military aid to the rebels 
and the contras say the possibility of a resumption of such aid 
puts pressure on the government to accept democratic reforms 
the fourth round of talks failed last week to find an end to the 
war that has been waged for more than six years although the 
contras said there would be no further meetings it appeared that 
they left the door ajar 
alfredo cesar the head of the contra delegation said thursday 
as the talks broke off we have reiterated our deep conviction to 
looking to solutions to the conflict in our motherland in a 
civilized way 
contra leader adolfo calero was in washington last week and was 
quoted by the rebels radio liberacion as saying the armed road 
is the only option left for democratization in nicaragua 
a contra plan submitted thursday was described by the government 
as irrational it called on the sandinistas to disband the 
supreme court revise the public security law rewrite the 
electoral laws and set up an assembly to rewrite the 1987 
constitution 
the white house put the blame for the breakdown of the talks on 
sandinista intransigence spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
reagan administration was studying renewed military aid to the 
rebels 
washington had backed and trained the rebels covertly or with 
congressional approval since 1981 military aid legally stopped 
feb 29 and congress voted down reagans request for more war 
funding 
the us congress last approved contra military aid in june 
1986 the soviet bloc and cuba support the sandinistas 
on the first of three days of talks last week the sandinista 
delegation claimed the rebels wanted the negotiations to fail to 
pave the way for new us militlary aid 
a ceasefire has been in effect since march 21 but both sides 
have accused the other of violations 
the sandinistas 80000member armed forces have continued to 
receive soviet military goods and it is believed the contras said 
to number between 6000 and 10000 have been stockpiling supplies 
and weapons during the fragile truce 
the sandinistas have been in power since july 1979 after 
defeating the forces of rightwing president anastasio somoza in a 
civil war

rival palestinian guerrilla factions 
battled with rockets and mortars saturday for control of two beirut 
refugee camps police said nine people were killed and 35 wounded 
in the fourth day of fighting 
the battle in west beirut pitted plo leader yasser arafats 
fatah guerrillas against the breakaway fatahuprising faction of 
col saeed mousa fatah is the main guerrilla faction of the 
palestine liberation organization 
since fighting began wednesday in the bourj elbarajneh and 
chatilla camps 19 people have died and 95 have been wounded 
shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire shook beirut as 
guerrillas hammered each others positions with mortars recoilless 
cannons rocketpropelled grenades and heavy machine guns police 
said 
they said mousas gunners stationed in syriancontrolled hills 
in lebanons central mountains overlooking beirut pounded both 
camps with howitzers and mortars 
about 50 palestinian women who fled chatilla and bourj 
elbarajneh demonstrated saturday at west beiruts mar elias 
refugee camp which has stayed neutral in the clashes 
what a shame a palestinian beats a palestinian with fire 
chanted the demonstrators as they reached the office of 
fatahuprising 
col mousa better known as abu mousa broke away from the plo 
in a syrianinspired 1983 mutiny against arafats leadership and 
established his headquarters in damascus the syrian capital 
the heavy clashes continued through the day despite several 
ceasefire calls by a security committee made up of representatives 
of various palestinian groups 
the latest truce reached at noon eased the fighting but tension 
was still high 
police said the big guns fell silent but sporadic exchanges of 
gunfire were heard 
palestinian officials said 95 percent of chatilla and bourj 
elbarajnehs 29000 residents have fled the camps to live with 
relatives or in makeshift homes in basements of unfinished 
buildings in beirut others took refuge in shantytowns in south and 
north lebanon 
a statement signed who is left from chatillas residents 
appealed to the leaders of the plo and fatahuprising to try to 
stop the bloodshed 
we appeal to you in the names of chatillas patient and 
steadfast children women and elderly to intervene and work 
seriously and quickly to stop this crazy shelling of our camp 
the statement said 
the shelling has taken the lives of women elderly and 
children and caused grave damage to the camp it has become almost 
impossible to walk through the camp because most of its alleyways 
are blocked with rubble added the statement 
chatilla bore the brunt of fighting between plo guerrillas and 
shiite moslem amal militiamen in their threeyear war for control 
of the palestinian refugee camps 
almost every shack in chatilla is roofless and has gaping holes 
or bullet scars from the war between the plo and amal which sought 
to prevent the palestinian guerrillas from rebuilding the lebanese 
power base they lost after the 1982 israeli invasion 
the war ended in april 1987 after syrian troops deployed around 
the shantytowns ending a nearly fivemonth amal seizure 
arafats loyalists had flushed out abu mousas guerrillas from 
both embattled shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting in the 
last two months despite a reconciliation effort between arafat and 
syrian president hafez assad 
but the dissidents regrouped on the fringes of the two camps 
where syrian troops are in control 
on saturday a falling tree branch set off a landmine inside the 
old french embassy compound on rue clemenceau in west beirut 
causing minor damage but no casualties police said 
the compound was abandoned after a 1985 spate of kidnappings of 
foreigners and is guarded by a few french marines and lebanese 
police they maintain mines in the embassy gardens to prevent 
trespassing

a federal grand jury has subpoenaed from the 
cocacola co all documents related to its 1986 sales agreement 
with the soviet union as part of an investigation into possible 
bribery it was reported saturday 
the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution in their 
combined saturday editions quoted unidentified sources as saying 
the grand jury in atlanta was trying to determine whether cocacola 
bribed people in the soviet union to get permission to sell coke 
there 
a federal prosecutor refused to confirm or deny the report and a 
spokesman for the atlantabased company branded any allegation of 
wrongoing by coke as ridiculous 
the newspapers said sources would not say what precipitated the 
investigation and characterized the inquiry as in its early stages 
the 1977 foreign corrupt practices act prohibits americans from 
bribing foreign officials or political parties to get business in 
other countries 
us attorney robert barr would not discuss the report with the 
newspapers he did not return a telephone message from the 
associated press saturday asking him for comment 
any allegation of wrongdoing related to our business with the 
soviet union is ridiculous it does not even warrant a denial 
coke spokesman randy donaldson told the ap 
he would not say whether cocacola knew of any grand jury 
investigation saying the twosentence statement was the only 
comment the company would make 
cocacola in 1986 signed a sixyear deal to sell coke in the 
soviet union fanta orange another cocacola product previously 
was sold in the soviet union but the 1986 agreement ended a long 
period of pepsico incs exclusive hold on the soviet cola market 
by the end of 1987 cocacola had sold 10 million cases of coke 
and fanta orange in the soviet union claus m halle senior 
executive vice president of cocacola told securities analysts in 
new york last month 
the entry of coke into the soviet market culminated a 
decadelong effort on the part of the softdrink manufacturer to 
make inroads in the soviet union

the sevenparty afghan alliance long 
beset by internal feuding between moslem moderates and 
fundamentalists promised saturday to hold elections within four 
months on a future government for afghanistan 
the elections to be held before oct 15 will be held among 
guerrillas in afghanistan and refugees in pakistan and iran they 
will choose a council that will vote on setting up an interim 
moslem government to challenge the sovietbacked marxist 
administration in kabul the afghan capital 
the election decision should bury a leading cause of dissension 
within the fractious moslem umbrella organization 
alliance spokesman gulbadin hekmatyar said the decision was 
unanimous 
ahmad gailani head of the moderate national islamic front of 
afghanistan and the man who will replace hekmatyar as of wednesday 
said the alliance has been divided over the makeup of the interim 
government 
we believe it should be referred to the people some of 
our friends in the alliance believe everything should come 
from the top gailani said 
the alliance is often divided into two camps moderates and 
fundamentalists but on this issue moderate gailani and hekmatyar 
who is considered an extreme fundamentalist stood together in 
demanding elections 
an election commission set up months ago by the alliance will 
decide the details of holding an election in the midst of a war 
that goes on unabated despite the start of a soviet troop 
withdrawal the commission has a july 1 deadline for its report 
eighty percent of afghanistan is free i dont see the problem 
of an election said gailani 
aside from polling islamic guerrillas and afghans living inside 
the wartorn country an estimated 5 million refugees living in 
pakistan and iran will be asked to vote one third of our 
people are refugees said gailani 
he cautioned against anticipating elections according to 
western ways its not possible gailani envisions elections that 
combine the western oneman onevote concept with traditional 
afghan jirgas or councils 
gailani insisted that regardless of the methods employed or the 
composition of this government it is only transitional until kabul 
falls and a nationwide election can be held 
critics demanding elections argued against seven men making 
decisions and claiming to represent the majority of afghans the 
alliance is often split 43 with fundamentalists in the majority 
one of the latest alliance decisions taken over objections from 
the moderate camp called for a boycott of attempts by un 
negotiator diego cordovez to help form a broadbased 
representative afghan government 
gailani said mujahedeen leaders should at least talk to 
cordovez who mediated at the geneva talks resulting in the soviet 
commitment to withdraw its estimated 115000 troops from 
afghanistan a boycott argued galiani only leaves the alliance in 
the dark and dependent on secondand thirdhand reports 
gailani foresaw few difficulties in coordinating elections among 
commanders inside afghanistan he denied charges that mujahedeen 
have begun fighting among themselves for captured weapons and 
ammunition

fuller and several other officers beat ramos who required 
hospitalization for a cracked skull and possible brain damage

a newspaper and its reporters were singled out 
for blame saturday at a rally for supporters of a black teenager 
who claims she was abducted and raped by white men and reporters 
responded by walking out 
the rally organizers then banned the associated press and 
several other news organizations from a sunday morning church 
service to be attended by the teen 
the incident began during a tirade by lawyer c vernon mason 
about a newsday story earlier this year that said the rev al 
sharpton was a federal informant who wore hidden microphones to 
meetings with civil rights leaders and organized crime figures 
mason sharpton and lawyer alton maddox have made a racial issue 
of the case of tawana brawley 16 of wappingers falls who claims 
she was abducted and sexually assaulted by six white men over a 
fourday period last november 
after initially cooperating with authorities she and her family 
have refused to participate further charging a coverup glenda 
brawley the mother of tawana brawley was sentenced to 30 days in 
jail monday for failing to appear before a grand jury looking into 
the case 
the lawyers and sharpton say mrs brawley took sanctuary at 
bethany baptist church in the predominantly black 
bedfordstuyvesant section of brooklyn where about 200 people 
attended the rally mrs brawley was present but did not speak 
at one point mason shouted tell them gov mario cuomo 
how you tried to set al sharpton up for physical assassination 
mason then asked all newsday employees to stand and two black 
reporters did 
security guards reading from a list of reporters in attendance 
told the other newsday employees to stand all except juliette 
fairley 21 stood 
one of the guards put his hand on ms fairley and asked her to 
stand but she resisted 
im standing up she doesnt have to reporter clem 
richardson told the guards richardson and ms fairley are black 
about 18 reporters from other news organizations stood in 
unison when a guard said security wants newsday reporters to 
leave their colleagues walked out too in a show of support 
i left out of solidarity for reporters black and white who 
have been covering this story honestly aggressively and faithfully 
for more than six months said lyle harris a daily news reporter 
who is black 
the rev porter denson one of the rally organizers later said 
the guard had been misunderstood and that no one had been asked to 
leave michael cottman a newsday reporter said he had been asked 
to leave 
afterward richardson and billy house a reporter for the 
poughkeepsie journal and the gannett news service met with 
sharpton maddox and mason 
the advisers said that because of the walkout which sharpton 
termed unprofessional several news organizations would be 
banned from a sunday morning church service they were the 
associated press united press international the poughkeepsie 
journal gannett news service the new york times the daily news 
usa today and newsday 
hours after the rally a representative of mason called the ap 
and upi to say that tawana brawley would attend the service and 
asked that the service be listed on the daily schedule of events 
provided by the news services 
timothy gilles a spokesman for attorney general robert abrams 
who was appointed by cuomo as special prosecutor in the case said 
city police were not arresting mrs brawley because we have no 
intention of swooping in to participate in the media circus that 
the rev sharpton and attorneys maddox and mason are intending to

the homes of 25 workers who may have been 
exposed to radioactivity during an accident at a steel plant have 
been checked and found free of contamination officials said 
saturday 
twelve workers were decontaminated friday after molten steel 
spilled from a large ladle at the marion steel co plant and 
damaged two gauges containing radioactive cesium137 officials 
said 
plant personnel identified 28 employees including the 12 who 
could have been exposed to the material said sonya elam 
spokeswoman for the ohio disaster services agency 
teams from disaster services the ohio department of health the 
us nuclear regulatory commission and the us department of 
energy have checked 25 individuals and their homes and found no 
contamination ms elam said three workers had not yet been 
contacted saturday ms elam said 
the building in which the accident occurred has been closed 
while a consulting company cleans up the site under the supervision 
of nuclear regulatory commission staff members she said 
nrc spokesman jan strasma said the workers were trying to cut 
away molten steel after it had cooled when they came in contact 
with the cesium137 
the contamination was limited to the heavy clothing the workers 
were wearing except for one worker who received minor skin 
contamination 
apparently it the contamination got through or around the

maurice dawkins a black businessman and 
former democrat won the republican nomination saturday to run for 
the us senate seat against former democratic gov charles s robb 
dawkins 67 is the first black to run for the senate from 
virginia since reconstruction 
he won a first ballot nomination over two rivals after promising 
to put an end to the era of chuck robb in a fiery address at 
the state gop convention 
they said it couldnt be done but we did it dawkins said 
after his nomination they say chuck robb cant be beaten but 
were going to beat him 
dawkins and robb will square off for the seat currently held by 
rep paul s trible jr who is not seeking reelection 
dawkins a lobbyist and retired minister who lives in the 
northern virginia suburbs of washington dc defeated andrew 
wahlquist a former senate aide and gil faulk a mclean attorney 
for the nomination 
his speech combined a thundering attack on robb with frequent 
references to god faith and family he ended by leading the 
delegates in singing god bless america brining the crowd to 
its feet and swinging many uncommitted delegates into his camp 
dawkins switched to the gop after george mcgovern won the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1972 
he unsuccessfully sought the gop nomination for lieutenant 
governor in 1985 
robb is considered a huge favorite to win the seat he won the 
governorship by a fairly narrow margin in 1981 but left office 
highly popular four years later virginia does not allow governors 
to serve consecutive terms 
robb a lawyer and former marine who served in vietnam is 
married to lynda bird johnson daughter of former president lyndon 
baines johnson 
a number of republican leaders said privately that nominating a 
black candidate could cost the party some traditional support among 
conservative white voters 
political analysts said dawkins nomination was a calculated 
gamble to take away traditional democratic support from minority 
voters 
theyre stealing thunder from 1989 said larry sabato a 
university of virginia political science professor the democratic 
party is widely expected to nominate current lt gov l douglas 
wilder to run for governor next year wilder is the highest elected 
black official of any state 
although dawkins is considered the underdog he entered the 
nomination contest late and has not been cast against robb in any 
polls 
also saturday convention delegates rejected a bid by a 
supporter of pat robertson for a seat on the republican national 
committee 
incumbent flo traywick defeated anne b kincaid who coordinated 
robertsons presidential nomination campaign in the state 
asked whether her defeat represented a rejection of robertsons 
followers by gop regulars ms kincaid said youre not going to 
hear that from me 
but mark rozell a political analyst at mary washington college 
said the vote showed that the robertson people dont have as much 
influence here as many people said they would

sources as saying the cia completed an internal review of what 
stamp collectors call the discovery of the cia invert and 
turned the case over to the justice department for possible 
prosecution 
the public integrity section is debating whether to bring 
charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against 
the employees who replaced a sheet of 95 1 stamps bearing an 
upsidedown candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have 
the rare error the newspaper said

police here have won permission to use 
hollowpoint bullets on a trial basis outraging critics who say 
the bullets inflict far more serious wounds than conventional 
ammunition 
were very disturbed said joel maliniak a spokesman for 
the american civil liberties union of southern california these 
bullets are designed to cause as much bodily harm as possible they 
cause greater ripping tearing and death 
hollowpoint bullets mushroom to the size of a dime upon impact 
and have the force of a punch to knock a person down said police 
spokesman cmdr william booth they are far more likely to stop a 
suspect than roundnose bullets that can pass through someones 
body he said 
police commissioner bert boeckmann said statistics show that 
hollowpoints cause no more damage than roundnosed bullets and are 
less likely to pass through someones body and ricochet 
were getting so many instances of bullets going through 
people and striking another person boeckmann said were all 
convinced this is an improvement i see it as something thats 
safer by far 
the police commission approved use of the bullets for a oneyear 
trial period on may 31 said commission president robert talcott 
public protests blocked an attempt by police chief daryl gates 
in 1980 to adopt hollowpoints which are used by the los angeles 
county sheriffs department and other law enforcement agencies 
nationwide 
critics said they were not notified the issue would be on the 
commissions agenda may 31 and said they only learned of the 
decision friday from a los angeles herald examiner reporter 
we would have lobbied against it said michael zinzun 
chairman of the coalition against police abuse well see if we 
can take legal action for a moratorium and stop it 
the city is not expected to have the new ammunition available 
until september but an interdepartment bulletin advises officers 
they may purchase the bullets at their own expense at local gun 
stores

spanish naval authorities immobilized the 
greenpeace ship sirius at ibiza when it tried to interfere with the 
entry of a us aircraft carrier at nearby majorca island port 
officials said saturday 
they said the steering gear of the 152foot sirius was sealed 
off by spanish officials soon after the craft arrived at this 
mediterranean balearic island port on friday 
navy authorities told the captain ed engels that the sirius 
was to stay in ibiza until further orders and could not set sail or 
use its rubber rafts according to the port officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
crewmembers of the uss dwight david eisenhower carrier turned 
water hoses on antinuclear protesters in four rubber dinghies 
launched from the sirius who tried to stop the warship from 
entering palma port on thursday 
xavier pastor a greenpeace official said in a communique 
thursday the environmental organization was protesting the spanish 
governments allowing nuclear weapons into its territorial waters 
in violation of a march 1986 referendum 
green peace claims the carrier is equipped with nuclear 
armaments 
it is us policy not to confirm or deny whether a us ship has 
nuclear weapons 
spaniards voted in 1986 to retain membership in the north 
atlantic treaty organization with the conditions that spain be free 
of nuclear weapons the us military presence be reduced and 
spains armed forces remain outside the integrated nato military 
command 
pastor said a spanish navy official and two sailors were on duty 
aboard the sirius and national police kept watch on the ship from 
port 
nobody informed us on the cause of stopping the ship he 
said 
a us official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
confirmed that greenpeace had attempted to interfere with the 
docking of the carrier but said it anchored successfully without 
damage or injury to either side

federal scientists are secretly growing coca as 
part of an effort to learn how to eradicate the plant from which 
cocaine is derived according to a published report 
the new york times reported in sundays editions that the 
project has been kept secret because federal officials fear drug 
dealers or others might threaten the research program or its 
personnel 
researchers are looking for a reliable chemical or biological 
means to destroy coca in south american fields the source of most 
of the cocaine now reaching the united states 
the best prospect is a herbicide called tebuthurion 
manufactured under the trade name spike by eli lilly amp co 
environmentalists have expressed concern that the herbicide could 
be hazardous to the environment where coca is grown 
the cocagrowing project began about two years ago according to 
the times which ran photos of plants in a greenhouse near 
washington a reporter viewed experiments including the processing 
of coca into cocaine 
the newspaper agreed not to publish the identity of the 
researcher who granted access the site of the research complex or 
the federal agencies involved 
the project included several hundred coca bushes that were 
raised from seeds flown in from south america in diplomatic 
pouches the researcher told the times four varieties of the 
plants are being grown and researchers have found that herbicides 
that kill one variety may not work against others 
coca is very tough stuff the researcher said pointing out 
that a herbicidetreated stalk with brown and withered leaves was 
growing back

men who smoke a lot are just as likely to be 
overweight as nonsmokers according to a government study that 
found heavy smokers to snack a great deal and subject themselves to 
a variety of other health risks 
while smokers generally tended to be less likely than 
nonsmokers to be overweight that wasnt true for men who puffed 
35 or more cigarettes daily the national center for health 
statistics reported 
i was surprised by that charlotte a schoenborn of the 
statistics center said friday 
it may be just a consumptionoriented lifestyle smoking a lot 
and eating a lot for heavier persons she suggested in a 
telephone interview 
the report also said that smokers are more likely than 
nonsmokers to sleep less than six hours daily to skip breakfast 
to be physically inactive and to drink more 
people tend to put their health at risk in a number of different 
ways and the report found more risktaking behavior and less 
attention to the healthier practices of life among smokers said 
schoenborn 
among male smokers overweight was related to the number of 
cigarettes smoked daily but not in the expected direction the 
report said prevalence of overweight among males smoking 35 
cigarettes or more daily 272 percent was similar to that of 
males who had never smoked 281 percent 
by comparison 194 percent of men who smoked 15 or fewer 
cigarettes daily were overweight 
for women the overweight rate was 249 percent for those who 
had never smoked among women smoking more than 35 cigarettes 
daily 197 percent were overweight while the rate was 193 
percent for those smoking 15 or fewer cigarettes 
the male group found most likely to be overweight however was 
former smokers at some 30 percent 
for women 23 percent of former smokers were overweight more 
than for smokers but fewer than those who had never smoked 
overall smokers tended to snack less than nonsmokers 
schoenborn said but heavy smokers consumed more 
some 393 percent of men and 376 of women who never smoked 
reported snacking daily but for folks who smoked 35 or more 
cigarettes daily well over a pack and a half a day the snacking 
rate was 425 percent for both sexes 
for those smoking less than 15 cigarettes daily 347 percent of 
men and 327 percent of women snacked daily 
the report an analysis of the 1985 national health interview 
survey is based on interviews with 91351 people it is to be 
repeated in 1990 
while the data in the report were collected three years ago 
schoenborn said that health statisticians dont think the 
relationships among these factors change a lot in that period of 
time 
other findings included 
about onefourth of smokers reported sleeping six hours or less 
daily compared to 21 percent of nonsmokers almost onethird of 
the heavy smokers sleep less than six hours 
skipping breakfast was more common among smokers more than 
onethird of current smokers said they never ate breakfast 
compared with 18 percent of those who had never smoked 
about 22 percent of smokers said they were less physically 
active than their contemporaries compared with 172 percent of 
never smokers smokers also tended to choose less active leisure 
activities than nonsmokers 
heavier smoking was associated with heavier alcoholdrinking 
about 13 percent of smokers were classified as heavier drinkers 
compared with 36 percent of those who have never smoked

president reagan says the ussoviet treaty 
to abolish mediumrange nuclear missiles will work despite his 
announcement he wont be bound by senate restrictions on how to 
interpret the already ratified accord 
reagans announcement friday that he would disregard the 
conditions drew an angry response from senate majority leader 
robert c byrd and sen sam nunn the two lawmakers said the 
president accepted the language when he and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev exchanged the instruments of ratification at the 
moscow summit 
but reagan said his objections should not have any practical 
effect on carrying out the treaty and that any questions about 
interpretation should be able to be resolved in a spirit of 
mutual accommodation and respect 
reagan said he was stating his objections to protect the 
constitutional powers and responsibilities of the president 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty provides for the 
elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with a range 
of 300 miles to 3400 miles 
at issue is an amendment attached by the senate to the 
resolution of ratification that bars future administrations from 
changing the us interpretation of the treaty without prior senate 
approval the senate ratified the treaty may 27 
the democraticsponsored measure arose from a fight with reagan 
over his interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the administration had claimed that the longstanding interpretation 
of the abm agreement was too narrow and should be broadened to 
allow realistic tests of components of the administrations star 
wars antimissile system 
reagan spelled out his concern in a written statement issued at 
the white house after he departed for a weekend at camp david he 
said the senatepassed provision apparently seeks to alter the 
law of treaty interpretation 
he said the measure would give primary weight to executive 
branch statements to the senate above other sources which 
international forums and us courts would consider in interpreting 
treaties 
it subordinates fundamental and essential treaty 
interpretative sources such as the treaty parties intent the 
treaty negotiating record and the parties subsequent practices 
reagan said 
he said the administration does not take the position that the 
executive branch can disregard authoritative executive statements 
to the senate and we have no intention of changing the 
interpretation of the inf treaty which was presented to the senate 
 
nonetheless the principles of treaty interpretation 
recognized and repeatedly invoked by the courts may not be limited 
or changed by the senate alone and those principles will govern 
any future disputes over interpretation of the treaty reagan 
said 
byrd dwva countered the issue is whether any president 
may subsequently reinterpret treaty provisions in ways contrary to 
the shared understanding between the executive and the senate at 
the time the senate gave its consent 
the president accepted the condition when he exchanged the 
instruments of ratification byrd said 
nunn a georgia democrat who was involved in crafting the 
restrictions also objected to the presidents statement saying 
the treaty including this conition is now the supreme law of 
the land and the president can no more change it with a letter 
than he can change any other law with a letter

democratic platform writers are 
trying to forge common language on such issues as drugs and civil 
rights before tackling foreign policy and deficit questions that 
could divide the dukakis and jackson camps 
the partys drafting committee resumed work today on this scenic 
island resort 
when the panel broke friday eleanor holmes norton jesse 
jacksons platform adviser complained to reporters it is going 
too slowly you dont know what differences you have until you get 
down to cold language 
but rep william gray iii who is chairing the drafting effort 
said he wanted the 16 panel members to get acquainted and actually 
write the document themselves not rubber stamp something that 
falls from on high 
gray said afterwards i heard a real strong consensus on the 
issue of drugs wanting a very strong statement on education 
and an even stronger statement on civil rights 
gray from pennsylvania said he was in no hurry to put anything 
on paper before the democrats head home sunday 
a draft is needed by june 2526 when the full 186member 
platform committee meets in denver for the first time he said 
this process begins in mackinac and its going to go through 
denver and all the way to atlanta because you dont have a 
platform until its approved by the entire convention said gray 
chairman of the house budget committee 
democratic national chairman paul g kirk jr opened the 
mackinac meeting with an appeal to write a document that speaks to 
american families in their kitchens not to special interests kirk 
then departed 
both the dukakis and jackson camps were not satisfied with a 
2000word blueprint penned by theodore sorensen once john f 
kennedys speechwriter 
michael barnes a former maryland congressman representing 
dukakis said the platform needs to spell out how the democrats 
will deal with aids and the homeless 
boston mayor ray flynn one of the drafters said there 
should be a plank in this platform that says no person will sleep 
on the streets of america on grates or on park benches any cold 
night 
norton former chairwoman of the equal employment opportunity 
commission said we have made no decisions about what will go to 
the floor were trying to get so we can draft the first word 
asked about reports that jackson was getting conflicting advice 
on what demands to press and how hard to fight norton said she 
knew of no rifts but added i have to tell you he keeps his own 
counsels and makes up his own mind and everybody else really trails 
behind 
the sorensen paper styled as a declaration by we the people 
of the democratic party denounces voodoo economics condemns 
south africas hateful apartheid governmentsponsored 
terrorism and mentions in passing the need to find more homes 
and food for those who are homeless and hungry and to find more 
aid for those who have aids 
norton said sorensens language on south africa was one of the 
better parts of this document but still needs strengthening 
the motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs there 
probably is more the american people would like to have us say 
about drugs said norton suggesting a call for appointment of a 
cabinetlevel drug czar and mobilizing the coast guard and military 
resources in the fight 
james b booe secretarytreasurer of the communications workers 
of america and one of the drafters said the democrats need a 
platform that any democrat can run with instead of from not a 
legislative laundry list 
booe said the platform should not get us tangled up with too 
many specifics

allegations that the manager of a northwestern 
ohio nuclear power plant was disruptive in the control room 
after drinking at a new years eve 1986 party have come under 
investigation on capitol hill officials say 
officials of toledo edison co the utility that operates the 
davisbesse nuclear power plant near toledo said however that 
their own investigation showed the manager was capable of carrying 
out his responsibilities despite his drinking 
john scheibel staff director for the house interior 
investigations subcommittee said friday the panels review of the 
incident at davisbesse is in its early stages 
were just taking a look at it preliminarily scheibel said 
a congressional source who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
said the house energy and commerce investigations subcommittee also 
has been reviewing the alleged incident for a couple of weeks 
in addition the nuclear regulatory commission is wrapping up 
its investigation into the allegations according to nrc spokesman 
jan strasma 
strasma said the nrc initially had accepted the findings of the 
investigation by toledo edison but started a new review last july 
after the agencys resident inspector received more information 
from plant employees 
toledo edison found that the plant manager had been drinking 
before arriving at the control room but concluded it is clear 
that the individual was in fact fully fit for duty accordingly no 
disciplinary action is recommended 
davisbesse about 20 miles east of toledo was shut down for 18 
months after a june 9 1985 incident in which two main and two 
backup feedwater pumps failed operators restarted the pumps and 
kept the reactor safely covered with cooling water since then the 
utility has spent about 180 million to upgrade the plant 
strasma said the plant was in the process of starting back up 
the evening of dec 31 1986 when the manager was called to the 
site to check progress 
the allegation was that this manager had been drinking and he 
was disruptive in the control room strasma said 
he said toledo edison submitted a report on the incident to the 
nrc on feb 19 1987 the report stated that the manager had been 
at a new years eve party at which he had consumed alcohol and that 
when he later went to the control room he was outspoken and 
argumentative strasma said 
the report quoted a person in the control room as characterizing 
the manager as angry and briefly outspoken but that the person 
did not think it surprising or inappropriate 
while the utilitys report substantiated that the manager was at 
the plant shortly after drinking alcohol it said the allegation 
that his behavior was distracting was subjective and not 
substantiated 
toledo edison spokesman richard kelly said the utility 
thoroughly investigated the matter and could find nothing to back 
up the allegation that the manager had been unfit for duty 
strasma said the manager currently retains his position with the 
utility 
the probe was taken over last october by the nrcs office of 
investigations which reviews possible wrongdoing by licensees 
said strasma who added that a report on the incident was being 
written

house investigators are pondering whether to 
recommend impeaching us district judge walter l nixon jr of 
mississippi who is serving a fiveyear prison sentence for lying 
to a federal grand jury but is still drawing his 89500 salary 
nixon refused to testify during two days of impeachment hearings 
which ended friday but his lawyers claimed he was the innocent 
victim of big prize fever among overzealous prosecutors eager 
to put a federal judge behind bars 
defense attorney david stewart told the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights that nixon has 
committed no crime and has engaged in no impeachable offense 
but former federal prosecutor reid weingarten said nixon was 
aggressively lying to a grand jury when he denied he discussed 
a drug smuggling case involving the son of a wealthy mississippi 
investor with whom he had business dealings 
weingarten said nixon had a sweetheart deal with the 
investor wiley fairchild who had sold the judge three profitable 
oil well properties for bargain prices in 1980 nixon paid 9500 
for oil and gas rights and reportedly netted 55000 from the deal 
nixon has testified that the transaction was legitimate and that 
he made no promises of return favors for fairchild 
although he was accused of discussing the drug charges against 
drew fairchild with the elder fairchild and a former mississippi 
prosecutor nixon insists that he never talked to anyone about the 
case 
he also says the questions posed during his grand jury 
appearance were ambiguous 
nixon 59 a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge of the 
southern district of mississippi for the past six years is serving 
a fiveyear prison sentence at eglin air force base fla 
the supreme court denied nixons appeal of his perjury 
conviction last january he can continue to hold office and draw 
his salary however unless he resigns or is convicted at a senate 
impeachment trial 
before nixon entered prison in march the judicial conference of 
the united states the chief policymaking body of the federal 
judiciary reported unanimously to house leaders that 
consideration of impeachment may be warranted in nixons case 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the judiciary 
subcommittee that conducted impeachment hearings said his panel 
would leave the record open for further comments in nixons case 
until june 14 
shortly after that date edwards said the panel will decide 
whether to recommend impeachment by the full house 
a separate judiciary subcommittee headed by rep john conyers 
jr dmich ended three weeks of impeachment hearings thursday on 
federal judge alcee l hastings of miami who was acquitted of 
bribery conspiracy in 1983 
hastings fellow judges charged that he actually committed the 
crime and tried to conceal his involvement by lying under oath and 
fabricating evidence at his trial 
neither hastings nor nixon testified at their impeachment 
proceedings 
the only other federal judge to be indicted while in office was 
harry e claiborne of nevada who was imprisoned for tax evasion 
the senate convicted claiborne of high crimes and misdemeanors 
in october 1986 and removed him from the federal bench

a judge says he will refuse to 
accept divorce papers filed only under the initials of couples but 
a colleague says the judge should respect their wish for privacy 
if people are too ashamed to let the world know that they are 
getting divorced they should stay married judge margarito garza 
wrote in a memo to 148th district court clerk oscar soliz 
divorce petitions are public record and appear regularly in many 
newspapers initials in some cases are used to obscure the 
identities of couples 
garza asked soliz to call the new policy to the attention of 
anyone who is filing a divorce suit 
judge joaquin villarreal of the 347th district court said he 
disagrees with garzas stance 
a divorce is a personal matter between husband and wife 
villarreal said if the two parties dont want the public to know 
they are getting divorced its fine with me 
soliz said he cannot refuse to accept such a case if the 
petition is in order and that cases are assigned randomly by 
computer 
in initialsonly cases assigned to garzas court soliz said he 
will ask attorneys to modify the papers to fit with the judges

the federal government must extend its 
amnesty deadline for illegal aliens who briefly left the country a 
federal judge ruled friday but refused to allow ousted aliens to 
return to the united states 
both the attorney general and the group representing the aliens 
catholic social services inc said they will appeal the ruling by 
us district court lawrence karlton 
karlton in an eightpage order ruled that aliens living in the 
us who left the country briefly without permission from the 
immigration and naturalization service should be allowed to apply 
for amnesty through the end of nov 30 a sixmonth extension of 
the deadline 
karlton also ruled that illegal aliens who lived in the us 
then left the country and were caught and deported when they tried 
to return should not be allowed to come back 
the order covering 50000 to 100000 people nationwide affects 
those who left the country after nov 6 1986 when the alien 
amnesty law took effect 
karltons decision was prompted by a lawsuit filed by catholic 
social services the california rural legal assistance and other 
immigrantrights groups 
the suit took issue with the definition of the words in the 
immigration law brief causal and innocent departures 
the phrase by congress was interpreted by the ins to mean trips 
of less than 30 days for a legitimate purpose with ins permission 
and that those who left the country without permission would not be 
eligible for amnesty 
the lawsuit contends that many aliens who hurriedly left the 
country for noncriminal reasons such as dealing with family 
emergencies were improperly denied amnesty eligibility when they 
returned 
the appeal of the ruling is expected to be filed next week in 
the 9th circuit court of appeals in san francisco

premier turgut ozal will become the first 
turkish prime minister in 36 years to go to greece when he flies 
there monday on a historic visit to improve ties between the 
archrivals 
his trip was viewed as unlikely to produce any breakthough in 
major disputes dividing the two aegean countries but as one 
highlevel turkish official remarked the visit in itself is a 
major achievement 
the last turkish prime minister to go to greece was adnan 
menderes later executed after a military coup he paid a visit in 
1952 
for ozal 61 the trip is the realization of a goal declared 
years ago he said after coming to power in 1983 that he was 
extending an olive branch to greek premier andreas papandreou and 
was willing to meet him anywhere any time 
he suggested that turks and greeks put off trying to solve major 
conflicts and first establish a dialogue aimed at building 
confidence with cooperation in areas such as tourism 
ozal was the architect of turkeys 1980 economic recovery 
program but was considered a novice in diplomacy at the start of 
his term 
the road to athens opened when papandreou having rejected any 
negotiations for seven years pulled a surprise switch and agreed 
to meet ozal in davos switzerland at the meeting last january 
the two accepted a formula for improving relations founded 
basically on ozals initial offer 
the two nato allies came to the brink of war in march 1987 over 
oil exploration rights in the aegean sea an event generally 
believed to have given an impetus to dialogue 
in davos ozal and papandreou declared their intention to avoid 
war and decided to set up two committees one political and the 
other economic and technical to start a process of negotiations 
since then the committees have each met once and turkish foreign 
minister mesut yilmaz has visited athens setting the stage for 
ozals visit 
in a memorandum the two sides pledged to reduce tensions in the 
aegean cooperate in fighting terrorism and drug smuggling and 
refrain from provocative statements 
mayors of athens and istanbul exchanged visits greek culture 
minister melina mercouri visited turkey on a goodwill mission 
greek university presidents were invited and feted in turkey 
and turkish business people went to athens to inquire about joint 
ventures 
yet the most intractable of their disputes over the 
mediterranean island of cyprus still overshadows these modest 
gains 
turkey boycotted a european economic community meeting in april 
to protest the mention of the cyprus problem in the opening 
statement a mention insisted upon by greece a full member of the 
eec 
one key reason ozal is out to improve ties with greece is his 
known desire to make turkey a full member of the trading bloc by 
the turn of the century 
many turks still express apprehension about the athens visit 
arguing that ozal will come under pressure to make concessions on 
cyprus 
cyprus is divided into southern greek and northern turkish 
sectors where turkish cypriots declared independence in 1983 the 
split came after turkey invaded in 1974 prompted by an 
athensbacked coup on cyprus 
an estimated 20000 turkish troops guard the boundary dividing 
greek and turkish cyprus 
greek policy demands that these troops depart prior to a cyprus 
settlement turks say troop removal can only follow a settlement 
which will protect equal political rights of turkish cypriots one 
fifth of cyprus total population of 750000 
in a recent interview with turkish daily milliyet ozal 
declared not a single man can be withdrawn as long as there is 
pressure on us 
he said he and papandreou agreed to keep the cyprus problem out 
of the process of reconciliation but conceded the issue will most 
likely be raised privately in their talks 
the other major problem conflicting claims on the aegean sea 
is more complicated but turks hope that as a problem just between 
themselves it can be more easily solved given time and good will 
the aegean sea is dotted by 3000 greek islands many just a few 
miles off turkey turkey objects to militarization of the islands 
saying that is against international treaties

house speaker jim wright says hes confident 
the ethics committee inquiry into his financial dealings will show 
he has done no wrong but republicans arent waiting to make 
political hay out of his troubles 
wright dtexas says the charges against him never would have 
been raised had the republicans not needed an issue to deflect the 
sleaze issue from their presidential candidate george bush 
i have absolute confidence that the committee will find that 
no rule of the house has been violated wright said i dont 
think theres any question but that theyre politically motivated 
wright said friday he had underestimated the amount to which a 
speaker could become a political target but if attorney general 
edwin meese iii and other reagan administration officials hadnt 
themselves been in ethics trouble i dont think there would have 
been a formal charge and all this fanfare he said 
the ethics committee consisting of 12 members equally divided 
between the two parties unanimously voted to begin an inquiry into 
six possible violations by wright they included 
contacting egyptian president anwar sadat on behalf of a friend 
and financial associate when the camp david accords threatened the 
friends middle east oil interests 
intervening with federal officials on behalf of another texas 
oil company which might have had some financial relationships to 
the speaker 
whether wrights campaign financed publication of a book for 
which the speaker earned 55000 in royalties 
the use of a capitol hill staffer and office funds to help with 
the drafting of the book 
the use of a fort worth condominium owned by the family of a 
business partner as his texas home without having to pay a monthly 
rent 
the committee was silent on whether it planned to hire an 
outside counsel to handle the case as republicans were demanding 
wright unleashed a media blitz on friday to refute the 
allegations in the investigation even before they were announced at 
midday he spent nearly two hours answering questions from print 
and broadcast reporters and released documents and a long narrative 
account of his actions 
my goal and just about my only professional goal in living at 
this point is to be a good and effective public servant wright 
asserted in the conclusion of his narrative 
rep newt gingrich rga who triggered the ethics committee 
actions by filing a formal complaint said he hoped the probe would 
show that wright is an essentially decent man who was sloppy in 
his business dealings 
but he added i think having jim wright third in line to be 
president and having jim wright with the powers of the speakership 
is very very dangerous to the processes of this country 
in houston at a texas state gop convention national party 
chairman frank fahrenkopf said the charges against wright would 
give republicans a level playing field in the fall election 
if the democrats are going to raise some kind of a sleaze 
factor theyve got to realize that people who live in glass 
houses shouldnt throw stones he said 
in a statement released in denver where he was presiding over a 
republican party unity conference fahrenkopf said 
the mounting questions underscore the need for the house 
ethics committee to establish and report the facts to the american 
people however more is required nothing less than a public 
investigation directed by an outside counsel will satisfy americas 
right to open and honest government

a french investigating magistrate has issued an 
international arrest warrant for alois brunner one of the last 
major nazi war criminals still at large he is believed to be 
living in syria 
brunner 76 adolf eichmanns righthand man was commander of 
the drancy transit camp from which thousands of french jews and 
resistance members were deported to concentration camps or 
extermination centers 
the arrest warrant was issued friday by judge claude grellier 
and follows a complaint filed dec 4 1987 accusing brunner of 
crimes against humanity specifically the kidnapping and murder of 
minors 
french lawyer and nazi hunter serge klarsfeld has entered the 
case as a civil party representing an organization called the sons 
and daughters of the jewish deportees of france 
klarsfeld along with his wife beate led the successful battle 
to have klaus barbie known as the butcher of lyon brought to 
france from bolivia in 1983 barbie was convicted of crimes against 
humanity last july and sentenced to life in prison france no 
longer has a death penalty 
brunner was tried and convicted in absentia in 1954 for war 
crimes and sentenced to death that sentence is no longer valid 
because the 20year statute of limitations has expired however 
there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity 
the charges against brunner involve the arrest of about 200 
children which the sons and daughters group says was carried out 
july 20 1944 and their deportation to the gas chambers at 
auschwitz in naziheld poland 
the klarsfelds in 1982 said they had found brunner in syria 
austria poland and west germany have previously asked for his 
extradition but the syrian government has never acted

michael dukakis and george bush the ivy league 
presidential candidates from harvard and yale are striving to 
educate americas voters about each others liabilities 
the game of political oneupmanship escalated when dukakis cried 
foul over bushs new attack strategy aimed at exposing the 
massachusetts governor as a leftwing liberal 
dukakis told reporters in boston friday that the vice 
presidents game plan is a losing strategy bush appearing at 
a republican party united 88 conference here retorted i 
wont be deterred from telling the truth 
while bush and dukakis engaged in longdistance insulttrading 
setting a likely tone for the general election campaign between the 
two virtually certain nominees jesse jackson was complaining that 
too much has been made of what he wants as the runnerup to dukakis 
in the democratic competition 
jackson taking a working vacation at a southern california 
resort complained that such questions about his ambitions are 
demeaning disrespectful and contemptuous 
and on mackinac island mich democrat platform writers voiced 
confidence that the desires of both dukakis and jackson can be 
accommodated party chairman paul kirk however warned against 
producing a document that would amount to the yellow pages an 
ad for every organized group 
bush chafing under heavy dukakis criticism in recent weeks 
about the vice presidents performance in the reagan 
administrations handling of the drug problem went on the attack 
thursday in a speech to the state republican convention in houston 
he charged dukakis with concealing a leftistleaning political 
orientation with moderate tones and with being born of the 
harvard yard boutique school of liberalism 
dukakis received an undergraduate degree in political science 
from swarthmore before graduating from harvard law school he also 
has many advisers with harvard ties bush received an undergraduate 
degree in political science from yale 
bush said friday he wasnt making a class argument against the 
massachusetts governor instead he said he was trying to say that 
harvard is a kind of philosophical enclave i see this as a 
philosophical cult normally identified with extremely liberal 
causes 
yale on the other hand is so diffuse he said there 
isnt a symbol harvard boutique to me at least has the 
connotation of liberalism and elitism 
dukakis refused to engage reporters in a discussion of his 
political roots although his campaign had said in advance of the 
bush speech thursday that they expected a mudslinging strategy 
by the republican 
asked to respond friday to bushs attack dukakis said i 
dont im going to campaign on the issues im going to talk about 
the future 
asked if he would bring up bushs yale background the governor 
said im really not interested i dont think the american 
people are interested i think its a losing strategy 
for his part bush was offering no apologies in his speech 
before the heavily partisan crowd of western state republicans in a 
hyatt regency hotel ballroom 
he said that dukakis and jackson have been out there dumping 
on me for six months they can dish it out but now lets see if 
they can take it 
four of bushs vanquished gop rivals shared the stage with the 
vice president urging republicans to unify behind the ticket this 
fall 
bush was warmly greeted by senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan rep jack kemp rny former delaware gov pete du pont 
and former secretary of state alexander m haig jr pat robertson 
sent a letter saying he could not make the meeting but that he 
thought bush had earned and deserves the support of his 
conservative followers 
said haig michael dukakis is a candidate of radical and 
dangerous change in third world affairs he is the reincarnation 
of george mcgovern 
jackson told reporters in california he did not think his 
supporters would turn away from the democratic ticket if he is not 
on it 
theyre not given to trauma easily he said my 
constituency will have a broad view of the many considerations 
they do not have a fixation on one position there is much to be 
considered

us secretary of defense frank carlucci said 
friday antiamerican riots in seoul are an internal south 
korean problem and do not threaten us forces there 
i got no sense whatsover that our forces were in any jeopardy 
in south korea on the contrary i received nothing but warm 
hospitality everywhere i went carlucci said at a news conference 
a day after arriving here from visits to japan and south korea 
following the moscow summit 
one would have thought that if there were any risk to our 
soldiers there would be some demonstrations against me and there 
were none he said i think what were seeing is limited in 
scope its an internal korean matter and not appropriate for me to 
comment on 
in seoul on friday riot police firing tear gas blocked 
thousands of radical students from marching to communist north 
korea for reunification talks the radicals claim the united 
states with its 42000 troops in south korea enforces partition 
to rule the south protests throughout seoul were bitterly 
antiamerican 
carlucci was in south korea for annual ussouth korean 
security consultations at which security for the 1988 summer 
olympics also was discussed 
of his talks with his soviet counterpart at the moscow summit 
carlucci said he hoped real gains had been made between the 
superpowers but the united states should not let its guard down in 
the face of friendly gestures from the soviet union 
we have yet to see perestroika restructuring impact the 
soviet military establishment carlucci said 
it would be certainly premature and the height of folly now 
for us to throw up our hands and say all is well while the soviet 
military machine continues to roll on

democrat michael dukakis says republican george 
bush has adopted a losing strategy for the fall campaign and 
the vice presidents rival says he will focus on the issues despite 
bushs personal attacks 
dukakis his partys certain presidential nominee also said 
friday that it was much too early to ask him about potential 
running mates 
and taking a position likely to feed bushs criticism of 
dukakis foreign policy views dukakis said he would move the us 
embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem if he was elected and 
israel continued to recognize jerusalem as its capital 
dukakis the massachusetts governor today was to address a 
friendly audience at the state democratic party convention being 
held to formally bestow an endorsement on the reelection bid of 
sen edward m kennedy dmass 
on friday after having a quick lunch with former president 
jimmy carter dukakis responded to bushs statements a day earlier 
that dukakis was an elitist whose views were far from the political 
mainstream 
at first he offered a blunt i dont when asked how he 
planned to respond to bushs attacks he then went on to say im 
going to campaign on the issues im going to talk about the 
future 
later dukakis who attended harvard law school and has many 
advisers with harvard ties laughed when asked if he would point 
out bushs own ivy league background the vice president attended 
yale 
i really am not interested dukakis said i dont think 
the american people are interested i think thats a losing 
strategy 
democratic rival jesse jackson has been pressing dukakis to 
offer him the no 2 spot on the ticket dukakis asked if jackson 
met his criteria for the spot said it was much too early to 
respond 
the process has just begun dukakis said this will take 
several weeks dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas a law 
school classmate of the governor is heading the search which 
dukakis has said he hopes to complete prior to the democratic 
national convention in midjuly 
dukakis spent a good portion of a media briefing dancing around 
the question of whether he would move the embassy in tel aviv to 
jerusalem which israel considers to be its capital 
dukakis said us embassies should go where the host nation 
says its capital is adding later that the policy was a regular 
rule of diplomatic courtesy later when pressed for a direct 
answer on whether he would move the embassy if israel maintained 
jerusalem was its capital dukakis said if israel determined 
that thats where it wants its capital then that is its capital 
id put our embassy there 
secretary of state george p shultz interviewed friday by 
nbctv said moving the embassy to jerusalem would ruin middle 
east peace efforts 
shultz who said it would be inappropriate for the united states 
to recognize jerusalem as the israeli capital because the city is 
regarded as occupied territory subject to disputes between israel 
and its arab neighbors 
dukakis said he and carter had a terrific meeting and talked 
about lots of things he refused to be more specific he said 
he expected carter to campaign for him in the fall bush frequently 
tries to tie dukakis to the last democratic administration 
on sunday dukakis was to travel to salt lake city to speak to 
the nations mayors kicking off a week in which he will focus on 
drug and anticrime programs

a soviet delegation has spent two weeks 
in capitalist sweden studying the social welfare system to see 
whether any aspect could be used to reform the soviet economic and 
social system 
we are not here to copy we are here to find efficient methods 
that within our socialistic system are the most efficient for our 
social development vice finance minister viacheslav senchagov 
said friday as the delegation ended its visit 
sweden is a capitalist country but its taxes are among the 
worlds highest tax income finances welfare programs which health 
child care and education free for everyone and guarantees liveable 
retirement pensions 
soviet economic experts and bureacrats examined the swedish 
retraining programs the tax system the labor exchange and 
cooperative companies they also visited factories and farms 
delegates said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika policy was now in its most active stage it was 
most important to increase production while safeguarding social 
goals they said 
perestroika means restructuring in russian and is a buzzword for 
gorbachevs program which seeks to reform the soviet economy and 
social system 
we are looking for a tax system to stimulate innovation and 
how to use taxes to get work collectives to use the socialist 
property in the best way senchagov told a news conference 
speaking through an interpreter he said the danger of 
perestroika was that it might create economic inequality in 
sweden incomes are equalized by a progressive taxes that takes as 
much as 78 percent in the top tax brackets 
the delegation arrived to sweden on may 29 at the invitation of 
social democratic prime minister ingvar carlsson it was scheduled 
to return to moscow today 
another member of the group leonid abalkin director of the 
soviet academy of sciences institute for economy described the 
swedish model as dynamic and efficient 
the social motives and humanistic goals in sweden are very 
attractive to us and we sympathize with the system he said 
asked why the soviet union had started turning to capitalistic 
countries for ideas abalkin said there is nothing peculiar about 
the fact that we after 70 years turn to other countries 
the socialistic system is open for all positive things in the 
world he said 
head of delegation anatoliy miliukov said swedens extensive 
labor exchange and retraining programs which include government 
subsidies to companies that give workers time off for study were 
of great interest 
he said that as a result of perestroika the number of officials 
at various ministries are being cut down sharply and that in moscow 
alone the number of employed in half of the ministries had been cut 
by 3040 percent 
we have retired a lot of these people others have been 
transferred to other institutions for instance to research

hungary needs radical reforms and faces 
years of social upheaval before its economic and social crisis will 
end a private hungarian think tank said 
in a separate discussion on state television a top communist 
party official revealed that hungarys economic woes meant that its 
defense commitments to the warsaw pact were not increased this 
year and will not grow in real terms through 1990 
in a report friday the state news agency mti summarized what 
it said were the results of a report by the financial research co 
a former state institute that went private last year after 
communist authorities threatened to close it for its critical 
analyses 
the new analysis entitled reports from the tunnel said 
hungary now faces a criticial situation externally and 
internally because reforms begun in the late 1960s did not go far 
enough in dismantling centralized state control over the economy 
production is growing ever more slowly the situation of small 
business has become less stable the inflationary pressure remains 
the selfrestraint by companies about price increases will not 
last long and the efforts to curb budgetary spending have not been 
successful said istvan csillag deputy head of the research 
company 
inflation has already touched 18 percent in hungary this year 
and many experts expect it to go higher 
mti quoted csillag as saying that the currently favorable 
assessment of hungarys prospects abroad will soon change unless 
more reform is adopted 
with a gross hard currency debt of 18 billion hungary is 
highly dependent on western assessments of its performance and 
reforms to gain further credits from governments banks and the 
international monetary fund 
mti quoted the financial research co as saying significant 
changes were needed including a shift to satisfying overall market 
demand rather than selected markets and new forms of ownership 
if such changes were implemented the report said then we may 
be out of the present critical situation in five to eight years 
time 
but it noted that this would only occur at a price of the 
upheavals that structural change will entail 
mti quoted the firms manager marton tardos as saying it was 
necessary to create popular support for changes even if they 
entailed unemployment and other unpopular reductions in the social 
support mechanism 
until the mid1980s unemployment was unknown in hungary which 
like other soviet bloc nations touted full employment as one of the 
achievements of communism 
hungary and other east european nations have now admitted that 
people employed in unprofitable state enterprises will have to face 
at least temporary job loss as state subsidies are shifted from the 
lossmaking firms to more profitable enterprises 
one area of communist budgets that so far has seemed immune from 
cuts has been defense 
but politburo member miklos nemeth indicated on hungarian 
television thursday night that hungarys economic woes have also 
affected military spending 
he said 1987 defense spending including costs for ministry of 
interior militia and for clothing and housing soldiers totaled 
about 1 billion 
the real value of defense spending was not increased in 1988 
nemeth said declining to give figures 
warsaw pact commitments also were not increased as in the past 
but kept the same in real terms nemeth said again he provided no 
figures

a mans land is his kingdom but the law stepped 
in when larry wilburns commercial lion hunts expanded to 
government marshland in east texas 
we dont want to put constraints on what he can do on his own 
property said ed white spokesman for the us army corps of 
engineers but we are concerned with safety 
wilburn says he has led paying hunters on six lion safaris this 
year at his 400acre island about 40 miles east of houston he 
wont say where he got the lions 
government officials became involved when two lion carcasses 
were found on government land across a roughly halfmilewide 
shallow river from wilburns isolated island the government land 
is intended for a reservoir and was being managed by the corps 
at least one lion was believed to have been released hunted and 
skinned on government property said charles craddock a corps 
ranger who usually monitors compliance with grazing and oilfield 
leases 
federal officials were unnerved by the idea of lions roaming 
free followed by hunters with highpowered weapons on land usually 
used by duck hunters and nature buffs 
i had a long talk with him craddock said he indicated to 
me that he was not going to hunt any more lions down there 
opposition to such lion hunts has come from as far away as west 
germany said patricia mercer executive director of the society 
for the prevention of cruelty to animals in houston 
people are appalled that something like this could happen 
she said its becoming a common problem across the us with a 
surplus of lions who breed well in captivity 
in the absence of regulations specifically forbidding lion hunts 
on private land authorities fined wilburn 125 for disposing of an 
animal carcass on government land and conducting a business for 
profit on government property white said 
in addition a us fish and wildlife service ranger who 
accompanied craddock to wilburns taxidermy shop april 29 fined 
wilburn 110 for not having a license to mount migratory wildfowl 
the lions wilburn used probably were bred in the united states 
said jim stinebaugh senior resident us fish and wildlife 
enforcement agent for south texas he added once theyre here 
they can be bought sold killed whatever 
under state law even african lions are not considered wildlife 
resources and therefore are not protected from hunters said phil 
evans a regulatory coordinator for the texas parks and wildlife 
department 
the lions were brought to the island in cages released and then 
tracked across the private property in hunts lasting as little as 
20 minutes wilburn said his price list for the hunts ranged from 
2500 to 3000 
once that lion is released there is no catching him back 
again he said im obligated to kill him i cant have the 
liability of a lion running around 
they made it sound like we were releasing lions in that part 
of the country hoping wed find them wilburn said when the 
cat was released it never left our sight 
wilburn said his customers had no preconceived notions about the 
hunt on the island which is covered by low vegetation 
they knew they werent in africa they knew they werent 
hunting for a free lion he said if they wanted that they 
could go to africa

the environmental protection agency says the 
last two manufacturers of a weedkiller that can cause birth defects 
must stop selling the herbicide but the agency will allow 
shortterm continued use on some food products in three 
northwestern states 
epa administrator lee m thomas on friday announced the agency 
has reached a settlement with the two makers of the herbicide 
dinoseb that would halt most current sales and distribution of the 
product 
but the government has said cedar chemical corp and drexel 
chemical co both near memphis tenn can sell their existing 
stock for use during the rest of this year on dry peas lentils 
chickpeas and green peas in the states of washington oregon and 
idaho the remaining stock may be used in 1988 and 1989 on berries 
in washington and oregon 
epa spokesman al heier said thomas decided to allow limited 
continued use of dinoseb into 1989 although it can cause birth 
defects and poses a hazard to mens ability to have children heier 
said there is no substitute herbicide to treat weeds affecting 
certain plants in the northwest 
certain crops would have been rather devastated if the epa 
had banned the weedkiller altogether said heier 
heier characterized the exceptions as small and said the tight 
restrictions were designed to protect people from exposure to the 
chemical 
several environmental groups had opposed any further sales of 
the weedkiller and any provision allowing for the use of existing 
supplies 
but epa estimated it would cost 40 million to purchase all 
existing supplies of dinoseb from chemical companies and another 
155 million to dispose of it as federal law requires 
fridays agreement came as a result of a challenger by cedar and 
drexel to an epa emergency ban of dinoseb issued in october 1986

pesticides and antibiotics can be removed from 
laboratory samples of animal tissues through the use of heated and 
pressurized gases that act like liquids a government scientist 
says 
the experimental process may be used by the agriculture 
department in the future in its testing of domestic and imported 
meat for chemical residues chemist jerry king of usdas northern 
regional research center at peoria ill 
his remarks to the third chemical congress of north america 
being held in toronto were made available by the department 
some pesticides sprayed on crops are believed to cause cancer 
and other serious health problems the chemical residues remain on 
grain used for livestock feed and can remain in meat products that 
are taken to market 
the agriculture department and other agencies are required to 
inspect meat to make sure that it does not contain such residues in 
excess of governmentally set tolerances 
antibiotics are regularly fed to livestock to prevent disease 
and can remain in animal tissues 
the new process for removing pesticides and antibiotics is 
called supercritical extraction king said 
he described supercritical fluids as gases such as carbon 
dioxide and nitrous oxide heated and compressed to densities that 
resemble those of liquids but actually represent an intermediate 
state between liquid and gas 
the process has been used for several years to decaffeinate 
coffee extract hops for flavoring beer and refine spice king said 
king said supercritical extraction removed nearly 100 percent of 
the pesticides in laboratory samples of lard that were deliberately 
spiked with five wellknown pesticides lindane endrin 
heptachlor ted and dieldrin 
right now we use this method for analytical purposes such as 
measuring the amount of pesticide in animal fat tissue king 
said but some day it could end the use of harmful chemical 
solvents used in laboratory extraction it would eliminate the 
problem of solvent waste disposal and be safer for technicians who 
routinely perform such extractions on a daily basis

from a blimp floating over the florida keys a 
proposed us government television service would beam a daily diet 
of american news shows sitcoms and soap operas to the people of 
cuba 
a senate appropriations subcommittee on friday agreed to spend 
75 million to start a tv version of the us information agencys 
radio marti which has been broadcasting to cuba since may 1985 
we want to accelerate the free flow of information to our 
friends in cuba and we want to send the message of democracy to 
everyone on the island said sen ernest hollings dsc 
chairman of the senate panel that agreed to add the funds to usias 
1989 budget 
the usia budget is to be considered by the full committee on 
thursday next week 
cubanamericans have been pushing the project as a natural and 
more effective followup to the radio service that is named for 
cuban patriot jose marti and devotes its air time to promoting the 
cause of freedom in cuba 
tv marti would be a much more powerful medium for informing 
cubans about world events as well as what is happening in their own 
country said jorge mas canosa chairman of the presidential 
advisory board for radio marti 
a program mix of american mexican and south american comedy 
variety and soap operas would easily draw cuban viewers he said 
they are anxious to learn about the outside world said mas 
who heads the cuban american national foundation which helped 
found radio marti 
the radio marti advisory board recently completed a feasibility 
study on television broadcasting to cuba radio signals can easily 
reach the island 90 miles off florida but tv broadcasting would be 
more difficult because of the nature of the signals a tv 
transmitter would have to be high enough to be in direct line of 
sight of the island 
the advisory board said the most feasible option would be to 
transmit the signal from a blimp floating over the florida keys 
mas predicts that tv marti would be even more successful than 
the radio service which radio marti officials estimate reaches 
about a quarter of cubas 10 million people 
but others are concerned about the kind of reaction a tv marti 
would elicit from cuban leader fidel castro as soon radio marti 
went on the air havana retaliated with immigration sanctions 
tried to jam the broadcasting signal and interfered with the 
reception of us radio stations by their american audiences 
us broadcasters are concerned about possible interference from 
retaliatory jamming as well as from the us signal transmitted 
from the blimp said william haratunian a consultant for the 
national association of broadcasters on international matters a tv 
signal transmitted so high in the air could cause problems for 
american tv stations nearby he said

disagreements among opec ministers 
meeting here today could cut as much a 2 off the price of a barrel 
of oil benefiting consumers the world over analysts say 
one faction of the oilproducing group is pushing for a cut in 
production a westernoriented camp is bracing to block the move 
venezuela libya and algeria want a production cut to keep oil 
prices at 18 a barrel but a saudi arabialed group has opposed 
the idea which failed to gain the support of oil ministers at this 
weeks arab summit in algiers algeria 
twelve of the 28yearold cartels members agreed in december to 
extend a quota of 15 million barrels a day until june 30 iraq 
which is at war with iran refused to sign the accord because it 
demanded a production quota equal to tehrans 
now the members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries are so divided over production controls that many 
analysts expect them to fight over the issue for at least a week 
and then give up they were expected simply to extend the existing 
quota until the end of the year 
harry neustein a new yorkbased oil trader who was to observe 
the meeting says the disagreement will cause oil prices to fall 
its going south which of course is great for the 
consumer neustein said 
some analysts said the lack of a new accord could force prices 
down by as much as 2 a barrel below the organizations target of 
18 
the oil markets also showed little confidence in the ministers 
ability to reach a consensus the july contract price of west texas 
intermediate the us benchmark crude oil fell 34 cents to 1673 
a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange on friday that was 
its lowest level in more than two months 
in addition the cartel nations are doing little to help boost 
the price currently they are producing an estimated 185 million 
barrels a day 34 million barrels a day more than their agreement 
allows 
the majority camp led by venezuela wants to cut production to 
push oil prices up nearer opecs target price venezuela ideally 
would like to cut production jointly with the interested producers 
outside the cartel 
the nonopec members involved in the dialogue with opec are 
angola china colombia egypt mexico oman and malaysia norway 
is attending the meeting as observer while britain is not 
represented 
venezuela aggressively backed an unsuccessful attempt by 
nonopec producers in late april to get the cartel to agree to cut 
production 
a minority of four opec nations led by heavyweight saudi arabia 
opecs largest producer blocked that attempt at the 
extraordinary opec meeting six weeks ago at which no new agreement 
was reached at the midyear meeting the minority opponents of the 
plan again led by saudi arabia want to boost production to match 
predictions of an increase in demand in the last six months of 
1988 analysts said 
however the cartels members dont even agree on how large 
demand will be 
estimates range from 176 million barrels a day to 189 million 
barrels a day 
in the first half of the year demand was 177 million barrels a 
day analysts say

democrat michael dukakis is off to a strong 
start in california and other longtime republican strongholds in 
his race against vice president george bush although a closely 
contested presidential election seemed likely according to an 
associated press survey 
the 50state survey indicated widespread optimism among 
democrats that dukakis can end eight years of republican rule in 
the white house gop officials in many states said the contest 
shapes up as a tight one but several said bush could win easily if 
he succeeds in his attempt to depict dukakis as an heir to the 
democratic partys liberal past 
dukakis leads in the polls in california and new jersey which 
last voted democratic in 1964 and is running even with bush in the 
polls in utah which gave president reagan his largest majorities 
in 1980 and 1984 one survey shows him running even in reliably 
republican nebraska and within striking distance in texas and

the agricultural credit act of 1987 initially 
appeared to be a lifeline for ranchers and farmers drowning in debt 
to federal loan programs 
yet five months after president reagan signed the bill and 
federal officials hailed it as a critical step toward helping rural 
landowners hold onto their acres the jury is still out for 
thousands of borrowers on billions of dollars in delinquent loans 
in the first quarter of this year the act helped 8500 
distressed loans to be restructured so farmers and ranchers 
could keep their properties according to ruth ross spokeswoman 
for the farm credit corporation of america 
but many other farmers owe their money to the farmers home 
administration whose regulations under the act are not yet 
settled and some have been unable to apply for the aid provided by 
the landmark legislation 
the borrowerowned farm credit system of banks and lending 
cooperatives lost 48 billion from 1985 through last year said h 
brent beesley president of the farm credit corporation of america 
which oversees the farm credit system 
the systems problems coupled with land devaluation and low 
crop prices were forcing thousands of farms onto the auction 
block beesley said 
the act provides up to 4 billion in federal funds to 
financially troubled farm credit institutions through 1992 
protecting farmers stock in those banks and cooperatives 
it also requires farm loans to be restructured changing the 
terms in some way so the debt can still be repaid if that would 
cost less than foreclosure 
until the legislation passed loan restructuring was a voluntary 
effort said jeff oates a spokesman for the farm credit 
corporation now the law says you will restructure 
i think its working just fine beesley said of the 
legislation investors have greater confidence in the system and 
so do borrowers were very pleased with the act 
but at the office of the coalition to save rural america based 
in this plains town in northeastern colorado the hotline rings 
steadily 
its sort of a big question mark said bill glover who 
estimated he had fielded hundreds of calls about the act because 
of the complexities in borrowing practices what happens in one 
lending institution could affect them in another federal 
institution 
the major stumbling block in the process arises from the 
structure of the federal lending agencies and the pattern of how 
farmers borrow 
many farmers have multiple loans spread among the various 
lenders the 37 farm land banks for example make longterm land 
loans and the 387 lending cooperatives known as production credit 
associations make shortterm operating loans 
those agencies come under the farm credit system but the 
farmers home administration which makes both types of loans is 
supervised by the us department of agriculture and rules for the 
fmha are still in the public approval process 
the fmha has balked at going along with restructuring plans for 
borrowers that hold its loans as well as others fearing 
vulnerability 
i had a case over in the western slope where the lender at the 
federal land bank said they would work anything out with the 
farmer as long as the fmha would agree to it glover said 
fmha couldnt agree to anything because the rules and regulations 
werent out yet and they dont know what they can agree to 
jerry slaugh a consultant who helps farmers with restructuring 
predicted it might take until january for the fmha to be absorbed 
into the act 
until then anyone with a farmers home administration loan is 
just in limbo he said its just putting a litte bit of a 
shadow on our efforts out there because they fmha are not ready 
to sit down at the table and negotiate about restructuring 
so far this year slaugh says he has saved 10 farms by 
restructuring loans he is working on about 50 more with bill 
byers a former farmer and his partner in ag management 
consultants based in grand junction 
the company has a contract with the states rural job training 
program to help indebted farmers it also has clients with loans 
from federal land banks in the wichita kan district 
slaugh estimated that those banks hold about 40000 loans in 
colorado new mexico kansas and oklahoma and that 4000 of them 
are distressed meaning they are delinquent or potentially 
deliquent thats about half as many as a few years ago 
the new legislation has given us more tools he said at 
this point the jury is still out weve had some success not as 
much as wed like to see but compared to when we started three 
years ago its a world of difference 
terry gutschenritter vice president of special credit for the 
farm credit system in wichita said his agency last year opened a 
special credit department for distressed loans and was able to 
bring back about 45 percent of 5000 loans so families could 
stay on their farms he said 
for farmers and ranchers with distressed loans the crucial step 
is to respond quickly to notices from lenders warned john stencel 
president of the rocky mountain farmers union a grassroots 
general farm organization with 18000 members in colorado new 
mexico and wyoming 
borrowers are currently receiving letters from the farm credit 
system advising them of their rights to ask for their loans to be 
restructured stencel said if borrowers dont respond within 
45 days farm credit can begin foreclosure 
if farmers miss the deadline they still have the right to 
request restructuring but the cost of foreclosure may diminish 
chances of restructuring as the less expensive alternative 
agriculture attorneys judith a shively and joseph dworkin 
partners with offices near the state capitol in denver see the 
1987 legislation as a tool particularly because it obligates the 
lender to notify the borrower before any foreclosure action is 
taken 
we have found farmers as a group have always been 
hardworking godfearing people who have paid their debts and now 
they find they cant pay their debts dworkin said and when 
you have to ask that type of an individual to file bankruptcy you 
get tremendous resistance 
but farmers today have to be aware of every single government 
program and use it to the max he said they also must know what 
it takes to grow cattle or crops and be good money managers too 
he said 
many farmers in trouble today meet those criteria but bad 
weather and the economy bring them to the rural coalition 
consultants like slaugh and attorneys who are experts in 
agricultural law 
the legislation will be beneficial but it wont eliminate the 
farm crisis gutschenritter said a positive income situation 
better prices is what is needed 
i think its going to be a much wiser farm credit system as a 
result of these times it will make us tougher better farmers

over the past two decades us industry has 
shucked a lot of its old bad habits and now is the better for 
having done so 
looking back its evident that the change wasnt motivated so 
much by enthusiasm as by fear by the fear for example that 
foreign manufacturers might steal not just foreign markets but us 
markets too 
old habits are comfortable habits and many us companies 
preferred the old ways and so disappeared from the scene so did 
typically american products such as television sets and 
calculators asia took over the business 
some industries fought back cutting their corporate 
bureacracies closing inefficient operations ending waste 
resolving labormanagement battles updating factories with robots 
and electronic controls 
in short us industry in the past 15 years or so has become 
leaner smarter meaner and more competitive still there remains 
a gaping weakness that could offset many of the modern improvements 
that weakness is the inability of many us companies to rapidly 
transform new technology much of it developed in the united 
states into profitable products 
that in itself would be reason to worry but there is an added 
dimension to the problem quick transformation or exploitation is 
the very skill of some japanese and other asian producers of 
hightechnology products 
more than half of over 500 us executives academics and state 
officials surveyed recently said that a major barrier to 
competitiveness is the excessive time lag in converting technology 
to new commercial products 
that study sponsored by the conference board the national 
governors association and the national science foundation found 
that an old bugaboo of us industrial management might be a 
primary source of the problem 
that bugaboo the seeming inability of american business to 
focus on longterm goals to have a distant vision of the future 
rather than a nearsighted fixation on the short term 
it doesnt take a study to realize two of the reasons why 
us corporate executives are paid and promoted for turning out 
products today not tomorrow ironically in focusing on 
todays products they end up turning out those of yesterday 
competitors beat them 
a flow of products results from longterm rather than shortterm 
goals yet according to the survey american business still 
indicates a tendency to become impatient with the longterm view 
us industry is under constant pressure to produce profits 
now not tomorrow 
executives have a limited time in which to prove themselves 
while they might believe that a corporate shakeup will show results 
five years down the road they must deal with the possibility they 
might be fired before then 
therefore they go with what they consider the tried and true 
and often oldfashioned products 
in addition the us investment climate is such that wall 
street brokers demand immediate results in fact there is pressure 
on executives of some companies to show results not in the next 
year but in the next quarter or two 
it creates a baffling paradox one that american industry must 
resolve if it is to keep pace with the often smaller more agile 
entrepreneurs of southeast asia

traders and investors alike are scrounging for 
new junk in the credit markets 
they are eagerly awaiting the highyield highrisk junk bonds 
that will be issued to help finance many of the mergers and 
acquisitions that have taken place recently on the corporate 
takeover trail 
there have been a number of deals completed in the last two 
months where it is anticipated that junk bond financing will be 
accomplished said michael dahood a highyield bond analyst at 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
he said british industrialist brian beazer is likely to use junk 
bonds to finance at least some of his 17 billion buyout of the 
pittsburghbased cement company koppers co 
and american standard inc is almost certain to come to market 
at some point he added referring to the 25 billion leveraged 
buyout of the company that is being led by kelso amp co 
it also is anticipated that toronto retailer robert campeau will 
raise more than 1 billion through the sale of junk bonds to 
facilitate his acquisition of federated department stores inc 
campeau also is likely to rely on junk bonds to finance the spinoff 
of ralphs supermarket chain as a subsidiary 
some of the takeovers do create very large issues and that 
alone is a sudden injection of product into the market said 
robert waill a managing director at lf rothschild unterberg 
towbin 
in terms of getting business going i suppose its good it 
does create a certain amount of motion he said 
a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions since the market crash 
resulted in a reduced supply of new junk bond issues that may be 
contributing to the richness of the market dahood said referring 
to the high prices at which are selling and trading 
conversely yields on many of these debt issues are not as 
handsome as they have been historically dahood characterized 
current returns as rather skimpy 
when comparing relative yields the junk bond market is 
providing a rather skimpy incremental return to the treasury market 
at the 10year issuance he said 
because highyield debt securities often are issued for 10year 
terms they typically are measured against the 10year treasury 
bill 
junk bonds currently are trading about 425 to 475 basis points 
above the 10year treasury bill which is hovering just under 9 
percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
in the past however junk bonds have traded as much as 600 
basis points above the government security and more recently 500 
to 550 basis points above dahood said 
putting it another way the premium for accepting the risk 
today is somewhat smaller than it has been he noted 
in addition to the takeover issues that might revive the market 
some analysts say corporations are being driven to lock in 
fixedrate debt as overall interest rates move higher 
companies that launched leveraged buyouts late last year and 
financed them with bank and bridge loans at floating rates are now 
getting nervous as interest rates move up noted gail hessol 
managing director of industrial rating at standard and poors corp 
one attractive option is to sell fixedrate public debt 
despite the high level of risk associated with junk bonds and 
allegations of scandal and wrongdoing at drexel burnham lambert 
inc the pioneer in junkbond underwriting investor interest 
remains keen 
some estimate there are some 160 billion in outstanding junk 
bonds with as much as 10 percent held by individuals as opposed to 
institutional investors 
a surge in junkbond mutual funds is also making the highyield 
instrument more accessible to the average investor quoting from a 
recent government study dahood said there were 23 junk bond mutual 
funds in 1981 with assets of 31 billion by sept 30 1987 the 
number had mushroomed to 72 and their assets totaled more than 30 
billion

a gathering of toplevel executives from the 
worlds biggest banks produced a picture of economic harmony 
supported by improved trade stable exchange rates and healthy 
growth 
while few economists would dispute those assertions made this 
past week at the 34th annual international monetary conference in 
chicago many agreed the current state of affairs particularly 
involving currencies was more a product of inertia than 
policymaking 
policy is on hold said robert a brusca chief economist 
for nikko securities co international in new york the 
policymakers are kind of hemmed in they dont know what to do 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan made it clear 
during the threeday chicago meeting that he didnt want the dollar 
to fall any further for fear it could harm ongoing attempts to 
reduce the huge us trade deficit 
greenspan told a separate press briefing the adjustment 
process by which the dollar has been allowed to depreciate over 
the past three years to enhance the us trade picture by making 
exports less expensive abroad has made significant progress 
but he said since manufacturers already are running at or near 
capacity levels due to healthy export growth further dollar 
declines wouldnt help them sell more goods overseas or anywhere 
else facilitating inflationary pressures 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl and bank of france governor 
jacques de larosiere publicly agreed with greenspan poehl also 
made assurances that his country wasnt trying to drive down the 
us currency discounting recent dollar sales as a routine effort 
to trim dollar reserves 
other central bankers at the conference included bank of 
england governor robin leighpemberton bank of mexico director 
general miguel mancera and takeshi ohta deputy governor for 
international relations for the bank of japan 
some currency traders and economists remained skeptical about 
the underlying motives of west germany and about how long the major 
industrialized nations could maintain stability 
david h resler chief economist for nomura securities inc in 
new york said there seems to be an emerging technical reason 
for the dollar to be on the firm side in the next month or so 
partly due to us agricultural sales to the soviets and chinese 
he said the bundesbank might privately be trying to temper the 
upward pressure of the dollar that might emerge a rise in the 
dollar should it occur would bring instability in the markets 
because its not sustainable 
economists say the upbeat picture publicly presented by the 
central bankers this past week amounted to an openmouth policy 
clearly aimed at maintaining the narrow trading range for 
currencies that has existed in recent months 
theres pr and hot air involved here they want to enhance 
the view that they are unified in the open they prefer the 
status said f ward mccarthy chief financial economist for 
merrill lynch capital markets 
but there are drawbacks to resisting change economists say 
for one thing theres no lure to foreign capital to make 
currency gains on their dollar holdings said brusca 
as long as they hold the dollar in this narrow trading range 
you have monetary policy effectively transmitted as though it were 
a fixedrate system said brusca and even though the rates in 
this sytem are fixed theyre not really fixed and you cant be 
sure the floor under the dollar is solid and dependable 
the currency markets have been trading on a floating rate 
system since early 1973 following about three decades of fixed 
rates that grew out of the historic postworld war ii bretton woods 
agreement 
the stage was set for a drop in the dollar in september 1985 
when the united states and its four major trading partners agreed 
to devalue the currency to help reduce the us trade shortfall and 
stave off protectionist legislation last year however that same 
group agreed that further decines in the dollars value would be 
counterproductive 
in the last three years the dollar has lost half its value 
against such currencies as the west german mark and japanese yen 
it has fallen less against the currencies of such major trading 
partners as canada south korea hong kong and taiwan

lovers of baconlettuceandtomato sandwiches may be inclined to 
add an extra layer of bacon to their blts this summer 
a glut of frozen pork bellies forced futures prices into a 
virtual free fall this past week and analysts say retail prices for 
bacon which is made from pork bellies will likely plummet as well 
the futures market for frozen pork bellies was created to ensure 
adequate supplies of bellies during the summer when demand for 
bacon peaks and supplies of slaughterready hogs traditionally 
bottoms out dealers typically stockpile pork bellies in freezers 
during the fall and winter then thaw them out and slice them into 
bacon during the late spring and summer 
last year light hog production resulted in tight supplies of 
frozen pork bellies for the summer months and futures prices soared 
last summer above 90 cents a pound a fiveyear high 
dealers compensated by packing away lots of pork bellies during 
last fall and winter they put so many bellies in cold storage that 
supplies swelled to nearly 103 million pounds by may 1 more than 
double the previous years may 1 figure and the third largest total 
on record for that date according to the agriculture department 
this year they got carried away when they put bellies into 
storage said chuck levitt an analyst in chicago with shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
they went from a period of deficit to one of tremendous 
surplus in one year because they overcompensated for having run out 
last summer he said 
because of this abundance the price on the chicago mercantile 
exchange for july delivery of frozen pork bellies has plunged 11 
percent already this month from 5632 cents a pound on may 31 to 
5007 cents on friday 
analysts said they expected the decline to continue until prices 
fall low enough to stimulate demand possibly as low as 40 cents a 
pound 
and those prices are certain to filter down to the retail level 
analysts said 
they should be able to offer relatively attractive bacon 
prices this summer said dale durccholz an analyst with 
agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
in addition to the large supplies of frozen pork bellies the 
market faces good supplies of higherquality fresh bellies caused 
by an unseasonably high number of hog slaughters analysts said 
packers have not cut down on kills because low cash prices for 
pork products have narrowed their profit margins said tom ohare 
an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
and durccholz said some hog producers faced with rising feed 
costs due to the spring drought may be partially liquidating their 
herds thus adding to the number of animals available for slaughter 
ohare said frozen pork belly futures prices may rebound briefly 
before sliding lower 
technically the bellies have definitely got to be oversold at 
this point he said its low enough that at some point soon 
youve got to get people saying hey this is overdone and going 
in and buying it

though the calendar says its still springtime 
wall street is talking up what it bills as a summer rally that 
began at the end of may in the stock market 
after drifting downward on shrinking volume for several weeks 
stocks came to life after the memorial day weekend 
by this past friday many of the leading market indicators had 
reached or approached new highs for the year and since the crash 
last october 
the revival of enthusiasm for stocks has puzzled many observers 
who havent noticed any drastic change in the economic news 
money managers at investing institutions it appears have 
simply decided that economic growth is holding to a pace that is 
moderate enough to continue without a serious increase in 
inflationary pressures 
it certainly looks as though the summer rally i have been 
writing about is upon us greg smith an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities told the firms clients 
in the lush world of wall street folklore few phenomena are as 
enduring as the summer rally 
never mind the numerous studies that have found that stock 
prices have no discernible tendency to do any better in the summer 
than at any other time during the year 
never mind that the very idea almost surely originated as a way 
to drum up business for brokers in a season when customers 
attention often wanders to distractions like vacations long 
weekends and baseball games 
as the past couple of weeks have demonstrated the phrase is so 
firmly entrenched that it can be applied to an advance that takes 
place before the summer has even arrived 
by whatever name the market turned in an upbeat showing in the 
past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 3041 
points to 210171 just a shade below its 1988 closing high of 
211008 reached on april 12 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 258 to 15289 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
increased 939 to 38625 and the american stock exchange market 
value index climbed 845 to 30933 
volume on the big board averaged 20441 million shares a day 
against 21633 million the week before 
there are some good things happening for both the economy and 
the financial markets said hugh johnson an analyst at first 
albany corp in albany ny 
the federal reserve has tightened credit conditions a notch 
but not too much the growth of the money supply should continue to 
be moderate during the next three months 
the economy on the other hand seems to be responding to 
changes in federal reserve policy or whatever by slowing down 
this is a good combination since it suggests that there will 
be enough liquidity to drive the economy and have some left over 
for the financial markets historically that has been positive for 
stock prices 
however he added when we are in the 66th month of an 
economic recovery it seems judicious to interpret economic signals 
quite conservatively 
a return of the kind of speculative mania that drove stocks to 
extraordinarily high levels last year is unlikely in the near 
future johnson said the memories of october linger on 
indeed few forecasters these days have their sights set on 
anything like the market highs set last summer when the dow jones 
industrial average peaked at 272242 a runaway rise back to those 
levels would be seen by many analysts as scary 
a nice little summer rally on the other hand would get a warm 
welcome all around
