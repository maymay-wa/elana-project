a black bear and a mule deer buck are 
the first large animals confirmed killed by the forest fires in and 
near yellowstone national park and firefighters have been warned 
to avoid any injured animals 
yellowstone national park officials had repeatedly said that 
larger animals such as deer elk bison and bear can easily 
sidestep fires that advance normally 
however fires in the yellowstone area have not behaved 
normally veteran firefighters in and around the park say they have 
never seen fire move so far so quickly 
the black bear was suffering from deep burns on its feet and was 
unable to do more than lift its head friday evening said tom 
safford a highway patrolman who was given permission by state and 
local officials to shoot and kill the suffering animal about a half 
mile east of silver gate 
all four pads were burned off the feet and down to the bone 
he must have run through a bunch of hot coals it looked to me like 
he would have been permanently immobile safford said 
the bear about 4 years old had been seen lying in a marsh 
about 200 yards above a highway for about 24 hours before it was 
killed 
larry folenius safety officer on the storm creek fire told 
firefighters at saturdays 6 am briefing that there had been 
sightings of some hurt bears and cautioned firefighters to be 
careful around them if they were spotted 
about seven miles west of where the bear was killed the charred 
carcass of a mature buck deer lay beside the road to daisy pass 
fire scoured the area wednesday another carcass was reported to be 
nearby but could not be located

sanctuary if needed according to a report in the englishlanguage 
hong kong standard 
burma has been wracked by weeks of unrest students have led 
demonstrations seeking to replace oneparty rule with a democratic 
government 
in the burmese capital of rangoon today the ruling party 
announced it would end its 26year monopoly on power and hold 
general elections under a multiparty system 
the newspaper said brang seng a key figure in the national 
democratic front had predicted todays action in an interview in 
hong kong earlier this week 
the fact is that they have to abdicate to leave to 
relinquish he was quoted as saying he said the burma socialist 
program party could not stay in power much longer 
the national democratic front is an alliance of 10 rebel groups 
all ethnic minorities fighting the burmese government brang seng

if the reagan administration wins final 
approval of its plan to allow china to launch usmade 
communications satellites national security will be damaged and 
the us commercial space industry will be cut off at the 
knees a democratic congressman says 
rep bill nelson dfla whose district includes the us space 
launch center at cape canaveral told reporters that chances to 
overturn the decision in the few remaining days of the 100th 
congress are very slim 
well give it the old college try but it will be very 
difficult to beat them back nelson said 
fridays announcement represented a victory for the state 
department which overrode contentions by the transportation 
department and private industry that the deal will place us 
producers of satellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage 
the plan was denounced by martin marietta corp which makes 
rockets for commercial use 
state department spokesman charles redman said the transaction 
is the first of its kind involving a nonwestern destination 
another official speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
president reagan made the final decision because of the 
interagency conflict 
the transaction is subject to approval by congress and by a 
group of western allies that monitor hightechnology transfers 
nelson said he believes national security will be damaged if the 
deal goes through because when we allow them to integrate one of 
the most sophisticated satellites known to planet earth onto a 
chinese rocket we have just given away a great part of the american 
advantage 
he said the sale will enable the chinese to learn technology in 
which the united states has the worlds leading edge 
were giving away american jobs and the technology needed to 
keep those jobs the congressman asserted the nation is ill 
served by this decision because it cuts the fledgling american 
rocket industry off at the knees 
redman said a license application was submitted by hughes 
aircraft co for the chinese launch of two of its satellites which 
have been ordered by an australian consortium aussat 
he also announced the conditional approval of a license for the 
launch of a third usmade satellite on a chinese launch vehicle 
known as asiasat the satellite will be launched on behalf of a 
hong kongbased consortium with chinese and british ownership 
redman said that in reaching its decision the administration 
was trying to assure the ability of the us commercial launch 
industry to compete on an equal footing with launches from a 
nonmarket economy while continuing to promote increased 
uschina trade

the postal service today is restoring the 
window services it cut last february in a move that saved 40 
million and helped cushion an expected 500 million deficit this 
year for the us mail system 
hours at post offices wont necessarily be the same as before 
the cuts were imposed however with local managers allowed to make 
changes that they think best serve their customers 
ordered by congress to cut out 160 million in spending the 
postal service made a series of changes including reducing window 
hours at most offices by a halfday per week 
the reduction in hours drew heavy criticism coming just two 
months before postage rates were increased 
postmaster general anthony frank has struggled to explain that 
the two events were not related 
the rate increase was in response to a rising deficit and had 
been in the works for more than a year the service cuts were 
necessitated when congress unexpectedly ordered the spending 
reduction it was part of an effort to reduce the overall federal 
budget even though the post office no longer receives a taxpayer 
subsidy 
in restoring the window hours local managers were given the 
option to adjust hours to suit the needs of their communities 
for example saturday hours will not be restored in heavily 
jewish sections of new york city where little business was done on 
that day anyway because of the sabbath instead managers will 
experiment with staying open later some days or perhaps having some 
sunday office hours 
in other areas instead of extending hours overall managers 
will add more clerks to handle business during peak times 
while the hours of window clerk service are returning other 
moneysaving cuts imposed in february remain in effect including 
curtailment of sunday mail collection and sorting and a moratorium 
on construction of new post offices 
congress meanwhile is considering bills to remove the postal 
service from the federal budget as a way to avoid similar service 
reductions in the future the window closings saved about 40 
million officials reported 
unless action is taken the postal service faces another 270 
million in spending cuts in the fiscal year that starts oct 1 
that will not mean that hours will be cut again however 
postal managers say they have found ways to cut spending 
although at the cost of slower service by such things as 
switching some mail from airplanes to trucks changing trucking 
schedules reducing management travel and training spending and 
cutting research and development 
the postal service expects to finish the current fiscal year at 
the end of this month with a deficit of between 500 million and 
550 million 
higher postage rates which took effect april 4 are expected to 
help boost the agency into the black in fiscal 1989 however 
the postal service has managed to break even over the last 
decade losing money in some years and showing a surplus in others

the first attempt to liberalize medicaid 
abortion restrictions in seven years appears doomed to failure in 
the wake of a house vote to continue paying for abortions only when 
a womans life is endangered 
the house voted 216166 friday to stand by existing policy 
rather than go along with a senate plan to permit 
governmentfinanced abortions for poor victims of rape and incest 
the abortion controversy arose in connection with a 140 billion 
spending bill for the departments of labor education and health 
and human services that also included funds for aids and student 
financial aid house and senate negotiators came to agreement on 
every other element of the massive fiscal 1989 appropriations bill 
but were stymied on abortion 
the house action added to mounting pressure on the senate to 
back off its amendment president reagan has said repeatedly he 
would veto the entire spending bill if abortion policy is 
liberalized 
the senate could act on the bill and the abortion question as 
early as monday senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
indicated friday 
we are disappointed but not defeated said kate michelman 
president of the national abortion rights action league in a 
statement after the house vote apparently anticipating a similar 
setback in the senate she added we shall redouble our efforts 
with the new congress and the new administration and well try 
again 
under an amendment authored by rep henry hyde rill medicaid 
pays only for abortions needed to save the life of a woman it had 
been seven years since either chamber had voted to liberalize the 
policy until the senate adopted the rape and incest provision on 
july 27 
specifically the senate measure said medicaid would pay for 
abortions in cases of promptly reported rape or incest states 
still would have the option of barring payments for all abortions 
except those necessary to save a womans life 
douglas johnson legislative director for the national 
righttolife committee issued a statement saying the groups 
pushing for these changes really want to restore federal funding of 
abortion on demand 
much of the house debate centered on the fundamental morality of 
abortion despite the narrow focus of the amendment 
you cant avoid injustice in a rape situation you cant avoid 
injustice in an incest situation but why compound the injustice by 
putting on top of it exterminating an innocent human life hyde 
said dont make us a part of that double tragedy out of 
great great tragedy some good can come 
lawmakers on the other side argued with equal passion that poor 
women victimized by brutal crimes are entitled to a full range of 
medical options 
the consequences to individuals are very substantial said 
rep steny hoyer dmd this is the appropriate and sensitive and 
humane step for us to take 
faye wattleton president of the planned parenthood federation 
of america accused the house of treating poor women callously 
to force a woman to bear her rapists child because she is poor 
is the cruelest insult imaginable wattleton said in a statement 
however some hyde allies noted that medical procedures are 
available to prevent conception after rapes or incest others said 
the proposed exceptions would create problems for law enforcement 
officers confronted with reports of rape 
what were going to do is make liars out of women so that they 
can get an abortion funded by the government contended rep 
harold volkmer dmo 
before moving to the abortion debate the house voted 33560 to 
approve the other portions of the threeagency spending bill the 
measure includes 12 billion for aids research treatment 
prevention and education 43 billion in education grants for 
disadvantaged students 55 billion in college student financial 
assistance and 37 billion for the job training partnership act

randall adams has spent 12 years fighting to prove 
he didnt kill the policeman for whose murder he nearly was 
executed the key witness now supports him and a new movie based 
on adams case has prompted petition drives demanding his freedom 
the thin blue line directed by errol morris strongly 
suggests the wrong man was tried and petitions are circulating in 
theaters calling for a pardon 
dallas county district attorney john vance said he is 
unimpressed by the film which is now playing in more than 200 
cities and sees no reason to reopen the case 
nothing in there convinces me we have the wrong man in jail 
vance said this week 
however evidence morris gathered in nearly three years of 
investigation including prosecution witnesses who told him on 
camera that they lied in adams 1977 trial is being used by 
attorneys to prepare a motion for a new trial 
the thin blue line uses both real interviews with most of 
the key people in the case and reenactments of the shooting from 
the perspectives of different characters 
im not a reporter morris said adding he prefers to call 
the movie a nonfiction feature 
on nov 28 1976 adams then 27 ran out of gas driving home 
from work david harris a teenager whod stolen a car and driven 
to dallas helped adams get gas and the pair spent the rest of the 
day drinking and smoking marijuana 
that night dallas policeman robert wood was shot and killed 
after he and a partner stopped a car being driven with only its 
parking lights on 
a month later when police arrested harris for an unrelated 
crime in his hometown of vidor in southeast texas they learned he 
had bragged to friends about killing a dallas police officer 
but when questioned by dallas police harris accused adams who 
had no criminal record with harris the star prosecution witness 
adams was convicted of woods slaying in 1977 and sentenced to die 
in the electric chair 
adams received a stay three days before his may 1979 execution 
date in 1980 his death sentence was commuted to life in prison 
after the us supreme court ruled that his trial jury had been 
improperly selected 
the film ends with harris now on death row himself for another 
murder saying adams did not kill wood in recent weeks harris 
made similar statements to dallas news organizations 
after harris statements appeared in dallas newspapers adams 
said maybe now people will start to listen a little closer to 
what ive been saying for 12 years adams has not seen the movie 
the ball is now in vances court said houston attorney 
randy schaffer adams lawyer he said he expects to hear within two 
weeks whether the prosecutor will contest a motion on adams behalf 
or seek a pardon from the governor 
the motion basically has to do with suppression of favorable 
evidence perjury by witnesses favorable documents and reports 
that were supposed to be turned over to defense that were not 
said schaffer and we have evidence with regard to adams 
innocence 
vance said its not unusual for a man on death row to say the 
things harris is saying he wont say how hell respond to the 
motion 
gov bill clements was out of town friday but his aide knox 
fitzpatrick said the office has gotten a number of letters about 
the case he would not say what the governors opinion was of the 
case 
petitions seeking a pardon initially were distributed by 
miramax the films distribution company said miramax spokeswoman 
christina kounelias now the petitions are being handled by an 
albanybased group called solace a support group for murder 
victims families and a subsidiary of amnesty international 
there was no immediate tally on how many signatures had been 
collected 
solace is also spearheading two fundraisers for adams one in 
chicago next week and another in boston the following week 
morris met adams while interviewing inmates for another project 
intrigued he arranged to meet harris before harris was 
arrested and convicted 
that first night david harris told me that he would never 
forget the look in that cops eyes which was completely to the 
contrary to what hed said at the trial where he said hed been in 
the passengers seat slumped way down morris said 
morris said former district attorney henry wade provided me 
with evidence that randall adams did not receive a fair trial in 
1977 that it was an illegal trial

seoul gourmets continue to enjoy dog 
stew and korean olympic stars have been consuming barrels of snake 
soup despite government attempts to ban the traditional delicacies 
during the summer games 
the government has outlawed sales in seoul of dog meat snake 
blood worm soup and other exotic dishes to avoid offending 
foreigners during the olympics which begin sept 17 officials 
said visitors might be disgusted by the unusual culinary offerings 
and koreans would be called barbaric 
but the ban has had little or no effect on seoul restaurants or 
the eating habits of their customers dog meat is still a lunchtime 
favorite in many backstreet eateries 
even the government officials eat it they just tell us not to 
let foreigners see said one restaurant owner who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the number of customers for dog has not dwindled not at 
all he said with a big smile 
korean athletes training for the olympics have been eating dog 
snakes and deer antlers to help build up their strength and 
stamina boxers wrestlers and others believe eating dog and snake 
will give them the endurance and strength of the animals 
seoul newspapers reported the korea amateur hockey association 
provided the countrys womens olympic team with 28000 worth of 
snake soup association officials declined to comment 
star player kim kyesook was quoted by the korea herald as 
saying i was so surprised when the association officials brought 
the snake soup to us but after taking the soup i felt much 
stronger 
olympic soccer star choi soonho was quoted as saying he ate 500 
snakes as part of his summer training 
the korean amateur wrestling federation provided funds to the 
olympic wrestling team to buy snake soup and kaesoju a mixture 
of dog meat and herbs that builds strength newspapers reported 
officials say a ban was imposed on dog meat in seoul about five 
years ago because the government feared dog restaurants would 
offend westerners and create an image of koreans eating lovable 
pets 
sales continued and restaurant owners say city officials 
recently repeated warnings not to serve dog during the olympics 
but they said officials told them restrictions would be eased after 
the games 
a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
ban backfired by focusing attention on the dog meat issue he said 
it also stirred protests from many koreans about ridiculing 
national tradition 
the french eat snails and horses and everyone says they are 
great eaters why shouldnt we eat dogmeat he said 
koreans say dogs used for eating are specially raised just like 
cattle they bridle at suggestions that pets are eaten and say they 
love and care for dogs as much as anyone 
a restaurant owner who takes pride in his own special recipe 
for dog stew said the food was a traditional part of korean 
cooking and a part of the nations culture the meat is seasoned 
with garlic and other spices and usually served as stew 
how can our indigenous habits be cast away in a day the man 
said im sure this will not perish forever by any means 
seoul municipal officials conceded the ban was very difficult to 
impose and it has had little impact dog meat restaurants are still 
legal in the rest of the country 
restaurant owners caught selling dog meat three times in a year 
have their licenses confiscated officials said no statistics were 
available on the number of cases prosecuted by the city 
you tell us where they are selling dog food and we will send 
an inspector said a health department official 
some foreigners far from being appalled by dog meat have tried 
the dish and found it agreeable 
its good much better than roast pork said one visiting 
journalist

lauro f cavazos says its time americans 
start caring about the educational needs of all citizens and 
he is promising to put the focus on the issue if confirmed as the 
next education secretary 
i know this wont be turned around in a decade we cant wait 
any longer weve waited too long cavazos told the senate labor 
and human resources committee as it considered his nomination 
friday to replace outgoing education secretary william j bennett 
if sworn in cavazos would become the first hispanic member of a 
presidents cabinet 
cavazos 61 appeared headed for an easy confirmation with 
senators praising the son of a cattle foreman on the king ranch in 
texas who went on to become president of texas tech university he 
became the first hispanic and the first graduate of the school to 
hold the post with his selection in 1980 
he is eminently qualified for this appointment with 
considerable experience in higher education said sen claiborne 
pell dri and in view of the fact that he has 10 children 
between the ages of 21 and 31 he has also had a central investment 
in elementary and secondary education 
committee chairman edward m kennedy dmass said he was 
impressed and reassured by cavazos testimony that he would fight 
for increased spending and for making the education department a 
vigorous advocate of education for all 
your responses have been enormously helpful and i look forward 
to supporting you now kennedy said im going to do everything 
we can to assure an early confirmation 
kennedy said a vote by the committee may be taken tuesday 
it seems like youre the type of person who can come in here 
and heal any wounds that might exist and build that consensus 
said sen orrin hatch rutah 
president reagan last month nominated cavazos to replace the 
oftenconfrontational bennett 
cavazos during questioning by kennedy said he disagreed with 
some of bennetts positions including the secretarys claim that 
bilingual education had been a failure 
bennett declared in 1985 there was no evidence that the 
bilingual education act had helped children but cavazos said i 
believe there has been a tremendous amount of success across a long 
period of time 
cavazos praised bennett and the administrations leadership in 
education however saying that in the past seven years we have 
arrested the decline in american education but we still have 
much to accomplish 
we must do everything in our power to help each student reach 
his or her potential cavazos said to remain a great nation 
we must ensure that no human resource is left untapped we must 
keep our young people in school make our citizens literate 
provide opportunity to our minority students and foster 
independence for handicapped students america needs the full 
participation of every individual and the only way to ensure this 
is through quality education 
cavazos has a bachelors degree in zoology and a masters degree 
in cytology the study of cells from texas tech and a 1954 
doctorate in physiology from iowa state university

new york mayor edward i koch has 
characterized as savage and less savage a pair of bills 
that would call for an end to sludge dumping in the ocean by 1993 
but he urged the two be rolled into one to make the citys fight 
easier 
we hope that when the bill comes to the floor it will be one 
bill the two committee chairs will compromise out their 
differences and that we dont have to fight on every level front 
and back and on all sides koch said friday we would like to 
be able to deal with one bill 
the mayor met with house speaker jim wright dtexas and rep 
claude pepper dfla pepper is chairman of the house rules 
committee which could order that the two bills be combined 
wright and pepper indicated they will consider the request on 
merits koch said 
the two bills one sponsored by rep william hughes dnj 
the other by rep henry nowak dny both mandate that new york 
city and eight other sewage authorities stop dumping sludge in the 
atlantic ocean by dec 31 1992 
new york city which produces 38 million wet tons of sludge a 
year has said it cannot meet that deadline and needs until at 
least 1998 to find disposal alternatives 
the other authorities that are dumping sludge 106 miles offshore 
are nassau and westchester counties in new york and in new 
jersey middlesex county passaic valley joint meeting of essex 
and union counties bergen county rahway valley and 
lindenroselle 
those authorities that fail to meet the deadline would be fined 
on a scale that could subject new york city to paying somewhere 
between 146 million and 730 million a year according to judy 
chesser the citys washington representative 
the city does not like either bill koch called the hughes 
version savage and the nowak bill less savage the key 
difference between the two is the nowak bill would allow the city 
to enter a consent decree with the environmental protection agency 
which could stipulate that the dumping end by a date later than 
1992 although the fines would still go into effect chesser said 
we would be negotiating a consent decree on a schedule we felt 
we could meet she said of the nowak bill epa of course 
would be pushing us to have the most expedited schedule possible 
the epa has stopped negotiating with new york over the citys 
compromise offer to stop dumping by 1998 said herman phillips a 
regional epa spokesman in manhattan 
were not negotiating any deadline yet because were waiting 
to see what congress is going to do he said 
meanwhile the senate last month passed a similar bill to stop 
the dumping of sewage sludge by january 1992 under that bill new 
york city could end up paying up to 152 million in fines 
according to chesser 
city officials arehoping a later deadline will be worked out 
when the house and senate bills move to conference for 
reconciliation

the reagan administration is disappointed that 
negotiations on military bases in the philippines have broken down 
but secretary of state george p shultz says us officials will be 
patient 
he said the demands manila had made on washington were out of 
bounds 
we will be patient and we will be persistent shultz said 
friday but well also stick to our basic ideas 
shultz will meet in washington next week with philippine foreign 
minister raul manglapus and again in new york at the end of the 
month when they attend the special session of the un general 
assembly 
shultz said we seemed to have things on a pretty good track 
when he saw manglapus on a trip to manila last july but 
subsequently it didnt work out that way he said 
i am a little disappointed right now he told the board of 
directors of the general federation of womens clubs 
shultz spoke to the group about various foreign policy issues 
he was asked about the philippines when he opened the discussion to 
questions 
the united states is paying the philippines 180 million a year 
for use of the subic bay naval base and clark air base 
shultz and other state department officials have not said what 
the united states has offered to extend the agreement past 1991 and 
what the philippines demanded 
manglapus in a news conference friday in manila said the 
united states had offered 502 million for use of the bases and 
four smaller installations 
congressional sources told the associated press on wednesday the 
united states had offered to double the yearly payment to 360 
million as part of a 489 aid package 
according to the sources who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity the philippines requested more than 1 billion a year in 
overall aid 
asked if he would insist on the same figure when he meets with 
us officials manglapus replied oh yes we shall be 
clarifying that our position is reasonable 
we frankly think that what the philippines seems to be asking 
is out of bounds shultz said without referring to any specific 
figure we are saying that to them and trying to convince them 
he said the two bases were very useful to us and we 
believe they are very useful for the security of the philippines

the serbian communist party chiefs 
public defiance of the national leadership has thrown this balkan 
country of competing ethnic groups into its most explosive 
political crisis of the postwar era 
slobodan milosevic on tuesday rejected a call from the federal 
communist party presidium to put an end to nationalist rallies in 
the southern province of kosovo where minority slavs contend they 
are harrassed by ethnic albanians who form 90 percent of the 
provinces population 
on tuesday more than 100000 serbs and montenegrins who are 
slavs staged protest rallies demonstrators shouted give us 
arms and army to kosovo underscoring the serbian 
leaderships demand to send the army to kosovo to restore order 
kosovo is an autonomous region within the republic of serbia 
milosevic and other serbian leaders want to change the federal 
constitution so the republic can assert control over kosovo and the 
autonomous province of vojvodina 
under the 1974 constitution serbia cannot interfere in kosovos 
judiciary police or other institutions 
leaders of other republics oppose the idea newspaper editorials 
have said that the foundation of the yugoslav state is threatened 
commenting on the showdown the daily vjesnik of zagreb capital 
of croatia warned that an increasing number of yugoslavs were 
questioning the 1943 agreement that gave birth to communist 
yugoslavia the nation is made up of six republics each of which 
has its own constitution assembly and president 
we witness a sharpening of nationalism and chauvinism on the 
entire yugoslav territory the editorial said 
milosevics supporters planned weekend rallies in the city of 
jajce where the agreement was worked out but local officials 
rejected the plan the organizers then said they would hold a 
solidarity meeting there sept 17 
milosevic has lashed out at the national leadership by saying 
the serbs and montenegrins have shown patience for the 
inefficiency of this country and the incompetence of its 
representatives 
in tuesdays speech he asserted yugoslav leaders failed to 
bring peace to kosovo referring to slavs living there he said 
this summer their patience came to an end 
milosevic defended the fastspreading serbian discontent as 
justified expression of popular sentiment while opponents say it 
will result in anarchy 
within hours the yugoslav communist partys central committee 
scheduled a session for late september to take action on kosovo and 
milosevic who enjoys popular support in serbia and the belgrade 
press 
on friday the tanjug news agency said a police unit from 
another part of serbia would leave for kosovo to reinforce local 
police 
on thursday more than 10000 serbs and montenegrins assembled 
at the kosovo town of vucitrn to protest what they called 
aggressive assaults of albanian chauvinists and separatists 
the belgrade daily politika reported 
the rally followed an attack last week on the home of a serbian 
woman two ethnic albanians convicted of damaging the house were 
sentenced to 30 days in jail the ethnic albanian judge involved 
was dismissed and the terms were increased to 60 days 
demonstrators were heard singing a folk song that boldly 
compares milosevic to the late president josip broz tito the 
virtually uncontested leader of nonaligned yugoslavia for three 
decades 
most belgrade newspapers give a lopsided view of what is going 
on in kosovo scene of bloody rioting for greater autonomy in 1981 
they keep reiterating that more than 30000 serbs and 
montenegrins left the province in recent years because of arson and 
other attacks blamed on albanians 
ethnic albanians are rarely given a chance to respond in public 
to what appear to be grossly distorted accounts 
in the regimecontrolled press the slav exodus is entirely 
blamed on the albanians an estimated 500 of whom are in jail 
the tanjug news agency reported friday that authorities in 
duesseldorf west germany warned albanian families from towns in 
macedonia they would be turned down as political refugees because 
their true motives are purely economic 
conversely serbian media have had practically no reports that 
slavs have relocated for economic reasons from kosovo yugoslavias 
most underdeveloped region

only in beverly hills could a 
200000 chauffeurdriven rollsroyce be considered an eyesore 
but thats the problem facing david spellerberg who says he has 
gotten nothing but complaints and threat of prosecution for 
parking his 1954 black rolls in front of his art gallery on rodeo 
drive 
he says his neighbors arent just mad about the car but the 
people it attracts namely thousands of tourists in the last six 
months who have posed in front of the sleek black beauty while 
their pictures were being taken 
anyplace else in the world and people would be happy to have a 
rollsroyce parked in front of their business said spellerberg 
but not beverly hills 
spellerberg readily admits he leaves the car in the onehour 
metered space as a tourist attraction at the national heritage

andrei d sakharov the nobel laureate and leading 
soviet dissenter says he sees signs that the communist party 
hierarchy and mikhail s gorbachev himself are retreating from some 
areas of gorbachevs reform program 
asked friday if yegor k ligachev a member of the ruling 
politburo was behind the opposition to perestroika or 
restructuring sakharov said ligachevs speeches show he is a 
reactionary dangerous force but by far not the only one 
regarding gorbachev sakharov said he believed the kremlin 
chiefs speeches have become more radical and show a deeper 
understanding of the situation but he saw elements of 
backtracking 
the 67yearold nuclear physicist winner of the 1975 nobel 
peace prize said foes of perestroika are behind the continued 
defense here of the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 
that crushed a liberal communist government 
he said the reforms in czechoslovakia that led to the invasion 
are similar to programs now being pushed in the soviet republic of 
estonia 
sakharov spoke with reporters after he was presented with a 
certificate by us ambassador jack matlock making him an honorary 
member of the american academy and institute of arts and letters 
the scientist a key figure in developing the soviet hydrogen 
bomb later helped found the soviet human rights movement he was 
exiled to gorky in 1980 for criticizing the soviet military 
intervention in afghanistan and was only allowed to return to 
moscow in december 1986 
sakharov called perestroika a historical inevitability but 
added in may perestroika reached a very different period which 
could be called a reversal 
he did not specify what happened in may but remarked that the 
change showed at the 19th communist party conference in june 
in antiperestroika forces 
sakharov said antiglasnost forces clearly had the advantage 
at the conference of 5000 delegates held in moscow june 28july 1 
glasnost is gorbachevs campaign for greater openness on 
selected subjects 
some delegates at the party conference accused the official 
media of slandering people and of minimizing soviet achievements 
in august the government announced limits on the number of 
subscriptions the public would be allowed for certain publications 
most of which are involved in gorbachevs drive to reevaluate 
history in a more truthful manner and report current problems 
because of the subscription limits glasnost will be limited to 
a small circle of people and this will harm the whole process 
sakharov said 
soviet officials have said the restrictions were needed because 
there isnt enough paper for the newspapers and magazines to 
satisfy demand sakharov said the reason is that antiperestroika 
forces want to silence the publications 
in presenting the award to sakharov on friday matlock quoted 
the american academy as saying his absolute courage and absolute 
honesty make him a friend of all those who share a belief in 
reason in freedom of inquiry and in democracy for the sake of 
which he risked both his health and his life the academy is a 
new yorkbased society of artists writers and musicians

police fired rubber bullets and 
water cannons to break up an antigovernment rally of 20000 during 
a nationwide general strike labor leaders called for another work 
stoppage monday 
the clashes with police vandalism burning of cars and looting 
of stores resulted in dozens of injuries and arrests during the 
walkout friday protesting spiraling inflation and unemployment 
the unrest made the general labor conferations 12th general 
strike against the nearly 5yearold government of president raul 
alfonsin the most disorderly and bloody labor leaders and police 
blamed each other for the violence 
its a lie that the incidents began among participants of the 
rally said saul ubaldini generalsecretary of the labor 
confederation 
interior minister enrique nosiglia and federal police chief juan 
pirker said agitators in the crowd started fights as did members 
of rival unions when police attempted to restore order they were 
attacked the said 
under these circumstances police intervened to prevent 
further damage nosiglia said the police action was necessary 
prudent and correct pirker said 
nosiglia in a brief communique urged the federation to call off 
the monday walkout 
nothing justifies a new paralysis of the country which keeps 
delaying progress without any benefit to rights and liberties he 
said 
no deaths were reported in the unrest friday but several people 
had not regained consciousness hours after they were hospitalized 
about 50 people were treated at argerich hospital for tear gas 
inhalation contusions from rocks and sticks and abrasions from 
falling to the ground when struck by compressed water fired by riot 
police several dozen others went to at least two other hospitals 
two policemen were rushed to churruca hospital with severe 
injuries and about 20 others were treated for minor injuries 
pirker said he did not know the total number of people arrested 
inflation has soared 255 percent this year and 440 percent for 
the past 12 months unemployment and underemployment at a combined 
14 percent are near 14year highs real personal incomes have 
declined for three straight years 
every day theres less work and my family cant live on what i 
earn said daniel rio a middleaged truck driver who attended 
the rally thats why im here 
president alfonsin five weeks ago implemented his third major 
antiinflation plan since he took office in december 1983 the 
austral was devalued restrictions on some imports were lifted and 
voluntary controls placed on wages and prices 
the goal in addition to reducing inflation was to secure new 
loans from the international monetary fund and commercial banks to 
help repay interest 46 billion this year on argentinas 56 
billion foreign debt 
unions and the opposition peronist party raise the sensitive 
issue of national sovereignty in response to alfonsins shaping of 
national policy to meet demands by foreign banks 
the 35million member federation has complained bitterly that 
prices have risen despite the controls and pressed for higher wages 
fridays strike was effective across this south american country 
of 30 million in the capital buenos aires striking signalmen 
shut down commuter trains before dawn stranding thousands of 
people at home and causing huge backups on roads leading downtown 
after 8 pm the hour the strike was scheduled to end public 
transportation resumed and the capital city of 3 million was calm 
late friday several public transport unions said they would 
participate in mondays strike indicating that buses and subways 
will be out of service as well as commuter trains

sylvester stallone who played a vietnam 
veteran hero in his rambo movies got the governments ear when 
he complained that dying grass at los angeles national cemetery was 
a disgrace to the war dead buried there 
the federal government found money to pay the water bill for 
sprinkling at the cemetery where 77000 veterans are buried 
following stallones complaint cemetery director patricia hagler 
said friday 
stallone offered to pay for the sprinkling himself after he 
learned the veterans administration didnt have the money to pay 
the 9250amonth water bill and that watering had been halted 
until new funds become available oct 1 said his publicist warren 
cowan 
when i think about the amount of water that runs down the 
driveways of beverly hills the hypocrisy of it all becomes too 
much cowan quoted stallone as saying 
his interest alone in the situation precipitated the cemetery 
receiving additional funding from washington dc the grounds are 
now being watered ms hagler said 
stallones spirit of patriotism is evidence that he shares 
this nations pride for its veterans she added

iran and iraq remained deadlocked at unmediated 
peace talks and a recess appeared near after both sides publicly 
accused the other of blocking progress 
in a statement friday iraq said talks cannot go anywhere unless 
the disputed shattalarab waterway is cleared and iraq is allowed 
free navigation in it shattalarab is iraqs only outlet to the 
sea and forms the southern boundary of the two nations 
the statement was in response to comments thursday by irans 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati velayati told reporters that 
iran considered the two issues related to the waterway extraneous 
elements that should be raised later in the talks 
the iraqi statement dismissed irans position as fantasy and 
accused tehran of wasting time 
a unsponsored ceasefire took effect aug 20 clearing the 
way for talks on a lasting settlement of the nearly 8yearold 
persian gulf war 
facetoface meetings were held only on the first two days of 
negotiations and neither foreign minister has met un mediator 
jan eliasson since last saturday lowerlevel contacts have 
continued 
signs increased friday that talks would be suspended over the 
weekend before resuming in new york later this month 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
eliasson was expected to announce a recess and that the last few 
days were spent haggling over a resumption date 
among irans priorities at the talks are a withdrawal of troops 
to internationally recognized boundaries exchange of war prisoners 
and a un investigation to determine who started the war 
on the border question the countries are at odds over a 1975 
treaty setting the iraniraq boundary down the middle of the 
shattalarab 
iraq has renounced the pact and claimed the entire waterway but 
iran says it still considers the treaty valid 
the waterway has been blocked by sunken ships since the start of 
the persian gulf war in september 1980

senate democrats are pressing ahead with a 
package of economic sanctions against south africa but concede 
that a united front of republican opposition will probably keep the 
measure from coming to a vote in the full chamber 
the senate foreign relations committee will vote next wednesday 
on the bill which would impose a neartotal trade embargo against 
whitedominated south africa and a neartotal withdrawal of us 
investment in the country 
republican members of the panel accusing democrats of playing 
electionyear politics with the issue refused a chance to offer 
amendments to the bill on friday they said they prefer the bill as 
it stands because it is so extensive that it will not attract 
enough votes to cut off a filibuster on the senate floor 
my guess is that it will be approved by the committee said 
sen paul simon dill a principal author of the legislation 
but because the republicans are apparently united it will not 
have the votes to overcome a filibuster we wont get cloture 
thats the way it looks right now said simon 
but even if we do nothing more than pass it out of committee 
it is a signal to south africa that we want to change the system 
of forced racial separation known as apartheid he said 
sixty votes are required in the 100member senate to invoke 
cloture and cut off debate on a bill 
the 1988 democratic platform brands south africa a terrorist 
state and democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has 
supported sanctions republican presidential candidate george bush 
has opposed new sanctions on they ground they would remove any 
leverage the united states may have to work for change in south 
africa 
after a morninglong debate on the sanctions bill republican 
committee member sen dan evans of washington told reporters 
i think its clearly clearly pushed by domestic political 
considerations and not be the urgency of the situation in south 
africa i think the bill as it now sits will not have a single 
republican vote on the committee 
a coalition of democrats and republicans enacted a milder south 
african sanctions bill two years ago over president reagans veto 
supporters of the present measure contend it is needed because 
the earlier and lesssweeping bill has not forced the south african 
government to end apartheid and to extend full citizenship rights 
to the black majority 
the house adopted a similar version of the farreaching senate 
bill on aug 11

the senate approved by voice vote stiff 
economic sanctions against iraq and condemned the alleged use of 
poison gas by the iraqi government against the countrys kurdish 
minority 
the iraqi army is waging a campaign against the kurdish 
population that can only be described as genocide sen claiborne 
pell dri said friday just before the senate passed the measure 
just 18 hours after it was drafted 
this is truly a crime against humanity it is genocide in 
fact said pell deploring the use of poison gas against kurdish 
civilians and the dynamiting of kurdish villages 
reps tom lantos dcalif and john porter rill introduced 
an identical measure in the house the lawmakers cochairmen of 
the congressional human rights caucus also sent a letter to iraqi 
president saddam hussein calling for an end to warfare against 
the kurdish population 
sadoon hamadi minister of state for foreign affairs repeated 
denials friday that any poisongas attack had taken place he said 
independent observers might be permitted in the northern border 
area of iraq where many of the kurds live if hostilities in the 
region end 
the bill which was sent to the house would require the us 
representative to international financial institutions such as the 
world bank to vote against all loans to iraq 
it would also bar all us financial credits or credit 
guarantees 
aides to pell said this would immediately halt at least 800 
million in credit or credit guarantees a step they said would make 
it even more difficult for iraq to service its huge 60 billion 
debt incurred during its eightyear war with neighboring iran 
the measure also would end the import of iraqi oil into the 
united states end any us economic or military aid and bar the 
transfer to iraq of sensitive high technology items subject to us 
export controls 
the pell aides who declined to be identified said the latter 
step would prevent iraq from importing vital spare parts for 
equipment and technology already in the country prevent it from 
completing certain projects and bar the export to iraq of such 
items as computers petroleum drilling equipment and air traffic 
control equipment 
pell stressing the bipartisan support on the foreign policy 
issue said he hoped the reagan administration will quickly endorse 
the bill

sixty films were presented at this years 
venice film festival but it was martin scorseses the last 
tempatation of christ that monopolized attention frustrating 
directors who feared their work was lost in the controversy 
even before the festival began the italian media had dubbed it 
the festival of controversy because of protests against 
scorseses film it includes a sequence in which jesus hallucinates 
on the cross about abandoning his role as savior marrying mary 
magdalene and raising a family 
scorseses film already had been under heavy attack in the 
united states and elsewhere from some christians and church groups 
in venice the film was condemned by roman catholic bishops 
vatican radio followers of excommunicated archbishop marcel 
lefebvre and italys dominant christian democrat party 
the importance of scorsese comes from the fact that it was the 
first screening in europe and people were interested in seeing the 
reaction in a society very different from america in the center 
of the catholic world said adriano donaggio spokesman for the 
festival that ended friday 
festival director guglielmo biraghi a former critic said he 
welcomed the controversy as long as it was constructive but some 
directors feared their work would simply vanish in the fog 
surrounding scorsese and his film 
italian director franco zeffirelli once threatened to withdraw 
his film il giovane toscanini the young toscanini because 
he feared it could be overlooked if shown too close to scorseses 
in the end zeffirelli left venice in a huff vowing never to 
return his film drew sustained applause from the venice audience 
but painful reviews from the critics 
i have brought my film to venice to satisfy the producers i 
did not want to come now i put on my crown of thorns and here i 
am on calvary he said at a news conference monday 
in a telling incident spanish director pedro almodovar angrily 
returned to a news conference wednesday moments after he left to 
berate festival officials for excluding some spanish journalists 
but actually it was the police who denied entry to the 
latearriving spaniards they feared the conference room already 
was dangerously overcrowded hundreds were waiting for scorsese 
who was greeted with an ovation when he arrived surrounded by 
bodyguards 
during the turbulent news conference scorsese defended his film 
as a work of fiction based on a novel he said the film did not 
seek to change anyones religious convictions 
the film was panned by many critics in italy who complained of 
uninspired acting and banal dialouge still scorsese was seen by 
many as a symbol of standing against censorship 
the biggest problem at this festival was scorsese said 
donaggio but he added that the scorsese film was also one of the 
festivals successes this year 
the success he said was defending the right to show a 
controversial film and let the public be the judge

the yonkers city council reversed itself 
and approved a courtordered housing desegregation plan early 
saturday caving in as fines hit 1 million a day hundreds of 
workers faced layoffs and public opinion shifted against them 
the 5to2 vote came at about 130 am following a day of 
meetings and discussions as pressure grew to resolve the crisis 
with hardliners in a raucous yonkers city hall condemning the 
politicians who now supported the plan 
as the final roll call was called and two of the four 
recalcitrant councilmen peter chema and nicholas longo changed 
their votes a crowd of about 100 in the gallery at city hall broke 
into loud cheers 
its time to put behind the fines the fight and the 
turmoil said chema before switching his vote 
but others in the audience were infuriated by the reversal one 
woman yelledyou little snake at chema while another man 
screeched at mayor nicholas wasicsko you sold us out nicky 
well remember the mayor also voted for the plan 
the city of 194000 just north of new york city has incurred 
16 million in fines yonkers faced a 1 million fine friday and 
was to begin laying off hundreds of city workers saturday the 
fines had started at 100 and doubled each day reaching 819200 
thursday for a total of 1638300 
us district judge leonard sand who ordered the end to 
segregated housing in yonkers three years ago will determine if 
the city must pay fridays fine 
its our understanding that if we pass this tonight we will 
not have to pay fridays fine city attorney paul pickelle said 
before the vote 
wasicsko said he received a message from new york secretary of 
state gail schaffer head of the state financial control board 
saying the layoffs set for saturday had been rescinded by the state 
emergency financial control board 
both chema and longo prefaced saturdays rollcall vote with 
long speeches saying they had reached agreements with the 
plaintiffs to make changes in the ordinance but also realized the 
judge would not agree to those changes unless the councilmen 
changed their votes 
in the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the 
abstract longo said it was the city being fined and the city 
being affected the abstract has now become a reality 
the city has been in contempt of court for the councils refusal 
to carry out the housingdesegregation order it approved earlier 
this year 
among the modifications made in the housing decree under the 
agreement with the plaintiffs was a commitment to build 100 
standalone units instead of the 200 previously approved with the 
rest to be part of other housing developments 
chema said they will also consider a home owners insurance 
policy to make up the difference in a loss of property value when a 
home owner sold a home 
changes in the plan worked out between the national association 
for the advancement of colored people and the council members must 
be approved by sand the us justice department and the federal 
department of housing and urban development 
earlier a lawyer for the naacp michael sussman said the two 
sides had hammered out a fairly complex agreement but that sand 
refused to consider the revised plan 
earlier friday the council and wasicsko gathered and voted to 
transfer 819200 to pay thursdays fine 
as the councilmen entered city hall some of the crowd angered 
by the report of negotiations shouted sellout sellout but 
another section applauded the vote to pay the fine drawing a quick 
response from wasicsko 
the fine payment came at a time where local support of the 
opposition to sands plan was starting to wane 
weve done all we can we went to the supreme court and didnt 
get anywhere said henry knetter 65 a northeast yonkers 
resident theres no garbage pickup there might not be any 
police protection it may be time to wise up 
knetter spoke for an increasing number of local residents whose 
ardent opposition to lowincome housing has dwindled as the harsh 
realities of sands stiff fines began hitting home 
phone lines at city hall were jammed this week with callers 
urging one of the adamant councilmen to change their vote wasicsko 
said uncollected garbage sits outside many homes children going 
to school have no crossing guards the three town libraries were to 
close saturday 
theyre yonkers residents saying to the councilmen more and 
more hey look we give up just get this thing solved said 
gov mario cuomo in albany 
the fines which began at 100 per day doubling daily until 
hitting a 1 millionaday cap on friday forced the state 
emergency financial control board to impose a doomsday plan 
aimed at providing public safety services while delaying bankruptcy 
phase one would have kicked in on saturday with 447 of the 
citys 1834 employees receiving layoffs notices as part of a 20 
million savings package the parks and recreation department would 
close while the planning department would be slashed to two 
employees 
other layoffs would come from the departments of real estate 
civil service fiscal services and public works control board 
chairwoman gail shaffer new yorks secretary of state said the 
cuts were designed to keep yonkers solvent until 1989 
sand who in 1985 ruled the city had practiced segregation in 
housing and education for 40 years imposed the fines after the 
four councilmen refused to implement part of his plan 
city schools were desegregated under a sandapproved plan and 
the city council initially agreed to build 1000 units of 
lowincome housing in january they reversed field on the housing 
at an aug 1 meeting prompting sand to impose fines which would 
double every day 
the us supreme court upheld sands fines on appeal but placed 
the 1 million cap on the amount

after a month battling fires richard 
gearhart would like nothing more than a break but he doesnt 
expect one as the worst fires in yellowstone national parks 
history burn unabated 
were real tired thats for sure gearhart said friday 
while on the fire line near the tiny community of silver gate 
which has been under seige by blazes for a week 
we could still go on but weve been away a long time he 
said wed like to go home for just a few days and then they 
could bring us back 
gearhart a member of the vista grande hot shots from san 
bernadino calif has been on the line 35 days normally 
firefighters are released for several days after 21 days 
but these are not normal times 
more than 800000 acres in nearby yellowstone have burned the 
151000acre storm creekhellroaring fire one of several in and 
around the park persists in threatening silver gate and cooke city 
northeast of the park 
firefighters see no sign of an improvement with high winds 
forecast over the weekend that are expected to fan the flames 
we are anticipating major fire activity forest service 
official brian avery said adding that today may be the worst day 
since this entire episode began 
today was to have been the day gearhart got a day off but then 
so was friday until friday came 
now that this is a national emergency maybe theyll keep us 
even longer he said 
as a hot shot gearhart and his fellow crew members are the 
first on the lines of the most dangerous sections of fire 
he works 1216 hours a day wielding a chain saw with a blade 
roughly 4 feet long and sometimes has to hike 5 miles to reach the 
lines 
the smoke and ash that gearhart breathes have left their mark on 
his sooty face as he walked along us 212 on friday his sagging 
shoulders and slow gait showed his weariness 
but despite the hardships he wasnt about to call it quits 
we cant pack it in he said we have people that work for 
the forest service full time its their job 
it is our job he added we said wed do it you cant 
really complain because we knew this could happen 
while there has been dispute over whether the thousands of 
firefighters are actually fighting the flames or merely managing 
their direction gearhart said he and his coworkers are doing 
their best under poor conditions 
when the fires flames get to be 300 feet high the fire can 
do whatever it wants he said 
were up against something that you really cant put out very 
easily without weather cooperation he said were basically 
fighting the fires the way you have to do it but its just not 
working out 
in his month on the yellowstone fire lines gearhart has gotten 
used to the danger of the work but hasnt forgotten who comes first 
its just trees and brush burning gearhart said 
theyll grow back we wont you just have to get out of the way

the new political fire and brimstone in michael dukakis blasts 
at george bush left black baptist ministers shouting in texas 
flagwaving thousands thundered when the gop candidate proclaimed 
in pennsylvania that hes questioning the judgment not the 
patriotism of his democratic rival 
in just 60 days we can choose a president who will enforce 
civil rights laws not veto them dukakis told a meeting of the 
national baptist convention usa a large predominantly black 
religious group in dallas friday he also advocated giving old 
glory another star statehood for the district of columbia 
dukakis talks earlier this week often seemed flat and attracted 
generally lukewarm applause but this time he spoke like a preacher 
at a revival and drew one of the best receptions of his campaign 
over and over he told the crowd the election is only 60 days 
away and from the crowd comprised largely of black ministers 
came loud shouts just 60 days 
moments earlier the group heard jesse jackson urge them to 
accept my recommendation and join him a former rival for the 
democratic nomination in backing dukakis on election day he can 
be trusted to help keep hope alive said jackson who slapped at 
bush and gop ticketmate dan quayle 
why do i support michael dukakis why do i ask you to go and 
support him with fervor because bush does not care and quayle does 
not understand dukakis cares and understands jackson added 
bush swinging through illinois and pennsylvania in search of 
their crucial electoral votes hammered at dukakis on defense 
issues friday he accused the democrat of contradictions and 
confusion about the fate of the strategic defense initiative star 
wars when ronald reagan vacates the white house 
calling it a fantasy one day something he wont rule out the 
next suggests a confusion in my view on the basic facts a 
confusion in terms of what he really believes and where he would 
take this country bush told a group of republican women in 
rockford ill 
dukakis suggested republican attacks on him are similar to 
joseph mccarthys accusations and other controversial tactics in 
earlier eras just as they did to president franklin roosevelt 
and house speaker sam rayburn theyre now attacking my 
patriotism dukakis said 
and just as they did in the 1930s and 1950s the american 
people can smell the garbage he added 
bushs audience at a flagwaving rally in york pa roared when 
the vice president said i understand that today the liberal 
governor of massachusetts attacked me for questioning the 
patriotism his patriotism im not questioning his patriotism im 
questioning his judgment 
while bush returned to washington for a weekend away from the 
campaign trail dukakis was back in boston to study defense issues 
before dealing with military and foreign policy matters in speeches 
next week 
three of the democrats chief defense experts in congress 
sens sam nunn of georgia and john glenn of ohio and rep les 
aspin of wisconsin arranged meetings with dukakis today and 
sunday said dayton duncan dukakis press secretary 
top aides developing plans for a pair of presidential debates 
agreed friday that the second round between bush and dukakis will 
be in los angeles said the democrats campaign chairman paul 
brountas 
brountas and bush campaign leader james baker had decided 
earlier to have round one in winstonsalem nc on sept 25 with 
the second debate either oct 13 or oct 14 depending on the 
american league baseball playoff series both debates are expected 
to be general in subject matter 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas the democratic vice presidential 
nominee pounded at the republicans on labor issues friday in 
california and also took the 60day theme 
bentsen joined in a democratic roast of the gops opposition to 
legislation that requires giving workers 60 days notice of plant 
closings or largescale layoffs democrats around the country 
passed out pink slips saying they were putting the republicans on 
notice their days in office are numbered 
bentsen told a cheering crowd at a union hall in bloomington 
calif were here today to give the republicans a better break 
than they give the american worker 
sure we could provide notice the republican way we could go 
there election eve and change the locks on the door said 
bentsen we could take the vice presidents white house mess card 
and cancel that and we could take away air force ii but we agree 
with the vast majority of the american people who say 60 days 
notice is fair 
quayle meantime said friday he got into law school fair and 
square not through an affirmative action program aimed at 
helping minorities no rules were broken he added 
earlier friday the cleveland plain dealer reported the 
admissions program quayle went through in 1970 was intended to 
offer equal opportunity to members of minority groups the 
economically disadvantaged and other students of different 
viewpoints and backgrounds 
while quayle was touring metals plants in ohio his washington 
office released financial records friday showing he and his wife 
own assets worth an estimated 14 million

heavy rains today exacerbated flood 
conditions in bangladesh causing swelling of major rivers that 
were already well above flood level officials said 
officials at flood control centers told the associated press 
that flooding worsened in 12 districts where earlier in the week 
the water level of major rivers had been receding 
the floods have covered threequarters of bangladesh and left 
onefourth of its 110 million people homeless 
dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1402 the 
governments count remained at 609 and is considered far too low 
the international red cross on friday said the floods had 
claimed 637 lives 
officials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected 
by the floods by friday evening at least 160872 people had been 
afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it the officials 
said 
in dhaka a city of 6 million 21412 new cases of diarrhea were 
reported friday by the government health center 
the rains friday and early today added to hardships already 
suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled 
together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking 
water cooked food or medical care 
health ministry officials said 30035 health workers were 
working around the clock to aid victims of waterborne diseases 
the officials acknowledged however that there was not enough 
medicine to help all those affected by the flooding 
millions of gallons of raw sewage and tons of garbage dumped 
into floodwaters in dhaka posed a serious medical threat to the 
capitals population a senior official at the dhaka municipal 
corp said he said the buriganga river which carried all the 
citys sewage was now mixing with the floodwater 
health officials have estimated that 40 million gallons of raw 
sewage a day are being dumped into stagnating floodwaters where 
children swim for fun and adults wade to food markets and relief 
centers 
a senior official at the agriculture ministry said that if the 
water does not recede in the next couple of days most of the rice 
crop will be damaged beyond any recovery 
the government has 13 million tons of grain and has issued an 
appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop

taewoos government and the united states for backing the 
government 
down with military dictatorship the students chanted as 
they marched around the campus with red white and blue flags 
the students some armed with wooden and iron clubs then 
marched out of the school to confront hundreds of riot police who 
were surrounding the campus protesters taunted the police and then 
attacked 
waves of masked students rushed out of the schools gates and 
climbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded in 
orange balls of blazing gasoline the firebombs exploded among the 
police setting fire to troopers shields and clothing 
police dressed in green combat fatigues and black visored 
helmets did not use tear gas because of government orders not to

the yonkers city council reversed itself 
and approved a courtordered housing desegregation plan today 
backing down in the face of 1 millionaday fines threatened 
layoffs of city workers and a shift in public opinion 
two of the four councilmen long opposed to the plan relented 
when confronted with the prospect of garbage rotting on the 
sidewalks closed libraries and skeleton crews of firefighters and 
police 
the 5to2 vote came at about 130 am after a day of meetings 
in which pressure grew to resolve the weeksold crisis it followed 
a raucous city hall session before about 100 spectators in which 
hardliners condemned politicians who supported the plan 
in the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the 
abstract the abstract has now become a reality said nicholas 
longo one of the two councilmen who changed their vote the 
thing that most affected me was looking over a list of people who 
at the stroke of midnight would become unemployed 
in long speeches before the vote longo and peter chema the 
second councilman who changed his position said they reached 
agreement friday with the plaintiffs to modify the plan 
the councilmen said they realized us district judge leonard 
sand would not agree to the changes unless the councilmen changed 
their votes 
the modifications worked out between the national association 
for the advancement of colored people and the councilmen must be 
approved by sand the us justice department and the federal 
department of housing and urban development 
sand who ordered the end to segregated housing in yonkers three 
years ago was to determine if the city must pay fridays fine the 
first milliondollar penalty 
city attorney paul w pickelle speaking before the vote said 
it was his understanding that if the council approved the plan at 
the session that began friday night the city would not have to pay 
thursdays or fridays fines 
mayor nicholas wasicsko said he received a message early today 
from new york secretary of state gail shaffer head of the state 
emergency financial control board that the layoffs had been 
rescinded the board had taken control of the citys finances and 
devised a doomsday budget 
the desegregation lawsuit was brought by the justice department 
in 1980 and joined by the naacp 
the councilmens speeches however failed to persuade some 
opponents of the housing plan 
you little snake one woman yelled at chema 
you sold us out nicky well remember a man yelled at 
wasicsko who supported the plan 
the fines had started at 100 and doubled each day reaching 
819200 thursday for a total of 1638300 in addition to 
fridays 1 million fine the city was to begin laying off hundreds 
of city workers today under the statemandated budget 
sand ruled aug 2 that the new york suburb of 194000 was in 
contempt of court for the councils refusal to carry out a 
housingdesegregation plan it approved earlier this year 
the plan calls for 200 units of lowincome public housing 
scattered throughout mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units of 
middleincome subsidized housing scattered throughout yonkers 
the modified plan would reduce the number of standalone 
townhouses and establish a nonprofit agency to manage the 
lowincome units rather than have them managed by the municipal 
housing authority longo said 
councilmen henry spallone and edward fagan jr continued to vote 
against the housing plan 
the vote came as support for the opposition to sands plan began 
to wane 
weve done all we can we went to the supreme court and didnt 
get anywhere said resident henry knetter 65 theres no 
garbage pickup there might not be any police protection it may be 
time to wise up 
phone lines at city hall were jammed this week with callers 
urging the recalcitrant councilmen to change their votes 
sand who ruled in 1985 the city had practiced segregation in 
housing and education for 40 years imposed the fines after the 
city council voted 43 against implementing the housing plan 
city schools were desegregated under a sandapproved plan and 
the city council initially agreed to build 1000 units of 
lowincome housing in january they reversed on the housing at an 
aug 1 meeting prompting sand to impose the fines 
the us supreme court on sept 1 upheld sands fines on appeal 
but also upheld a 1 millionaday cap imposed by an appeals court 
sand also imposed personal fines of 500 a day on the dissenting 
councilmen but the supreme court suspended the penalties

a government task force today proposed 
easing a 39yearold travel ban so residents of communist china can 
come to taiwan to visit sick relatives officials said 
the cabinet task force proposed that mainland chinese be allowed 
to enter taiwan to visit spouses parents or children who are 
gravely ill or seriously injured a government information office 
statement said the trips would be restricted to two months 
visits to attend funerals of close relatives also would be 
allowed the statement said 
the proposal will be submitted soon to premier yu kuohwa for 
approval it said 
the task force headed by vice premier shih chiyang was 
established last month to map out nationalist policies toward china 
the chinese nationalist government and about 2 million 
supporters fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
communist forces on the chinese mainland many of the people who 
fled to this island left close relatives behind 
nationalist authorities banned all official contact with the 
communist government in beijing but last year eased a ban on travel 
to the chinese mainland to allow taiwan residents to visit 
relatives 
mainland chinese who have been members of the chinese communist 
party or have taken part in any seditious groups would still be 
banned from entering taiwan according to the proposal

arthur encalade was philosophical about 
florence the hurricane that chased him from his home exactly 23 
years after an equally rude uprooting at the hands of hurricane 
betsy 
as he sat among 1200 other evacuees at belle chasse high school 
just south of new orleans on friday night the 69yearold encalade 
said living through storms is a way of life 
people live all their lives down here he said you hate 
to leave you go somewhere else and a tornado will take you or 
something else will 
its discouraging but what are you going to do he said 
if youre too old you cant go far 
florence was at hurricane strength friday when the evacuees left 
their lowlying homes but lost its punch as it brushed the coast 
and was downgraded to a tropical storm this morning 
thousands of residents of coastal areas in mississippi alabama 
and florida also took refuge in shelters and homes of relatives and 
friends on higher ground 
despite an almost casual acceptance of his situation encalade 
said previous storms have cost him dearly 
when camille in 1969 and betsy came over they cleaned us 
out i lost two houses he said 
now encalade lives in a trailer in buras on the tip of the 
mississippi delta 
weve got it anchored he said but if the storm passes 
over its going to take it anyway so you just lock it up and come 
up here and see what happens 
at the school cots were set up in the gym with large families 
grouped in classrooms some people brought tv sets and suitcases 
with changes of clothes 
sitting on cots walter and melodia buras of boothville were a 
little more pragmatic than encalade 
ive been in this school three times already mrs buras 
said once for betsy and once for camille when its a hurricane 
im gone 
they said they normally ride out weaker storms at home but 
anytime a hurricane nears shore they head for higher ground 
mrs buras said her quick departures when bad weather threatens 
sometimes draw jokes from neighbors 
they laugh at us when we get back but id rather be safe 
many shared the same outlook at st bernard high school east of 
new orleans where 170 evacuees took refuge 
where we live is gods little acre said ruth gonzales 
65 of delcroix island its the best place to live even though 
every time a storm comes through weve got to go 
so why not move 
if our homes destroyed well make another government loan 
and build again she said

a lawsuit that seeks to redress alleged 
discrimination against hispanics will represent a fundamental 
reordering of political priorities in the nations most populous 
county hispanic leaders say 
the suit filed this week by the justice department in us 
district court alleges that county officials discriminated against 
hispanics by drawing political boundaries so as to dilute the 
influence of hispanic voters 
it should have happened years ago said joseph m sanchez 
55 president of a thriving grocery business who was the first 
mexicanamerican to serve on the citys board of fire 
commissioners im just so excited about it 
sanchez predicted that changing the electoral districts would 
lead to higher voter turnout because of the likelihood that 
hispanic candidates will run for the board of supervisors 
sanchez and others said they expect redistricting will result in 
changes in county government services particularly in health care 
zoning police protection and social services 
a similar justice department case against the city government in 
1985 resulted in redrawn boundaries in which hispanics comprise a 
majority in at least three of the citys 15 council districts 
hispanic leaders say far more is at stake in the county 
redistricting case 
for one thing no hispanic or any other minority group member 
has ever been elected to the county board of supervisors 
yet the percentage of hispanics in the county is at least 27 
percent with blacks comprising more than 12 percent and asians 
about 58 percent according to the lawsuit 
without a doubt at least in los angeles the county board of 
supervisors is one of the most powerful elected bodies in 
government said city councilman richard alatorre 
being elected to the board of supervisors is like being 
elected pope alatorre said theyre the five gods 
i call them the five kings and a lot of people call them the 
five kings because of their imperial manner said alan clayton a 
state civil rights representative for the league of united latin 
american citizens 
such an appraisal is due in large part to the sheer size of 
county government the board of supervisors controls a budget of 
nearly 9 billion compared to the citys budget of roughly 35 
billion 
the countys population estimated at 85 million is greater 
than that in each of 42 states 
roughly translated that means that each of the five supervisors 
has a constituency of 16 million to 17 million people 
in comparison the ideal population set for us congressional 
districts during the reapportionment of the early 1980s was a mere 
526000 
and at 2615 square miles the countys 5th district seat in 
northern los angeles county is bigger than the state of delaware 
such huge numbers clayton said means that immense power is 
concentrated in the hands of a very few 
conversely clayton added mounting a political challenge 
against an incumbent supervisor requires tremendous financial 
resources 
striking a conciliatory tone board of supervisors chairman 
deane dana said the suit has left the fivemember board with little 
choice except to redraw our lines 
hispanic community leaders sounded ecstatic about the prospects 
of change to be wrought by the voting rights case 
hispanic groups have experienced a tough guy kind of 
attitude from the board of supervisors when they protested over 
clinics that have been closed said city councilwoman gloria 
molina 
the justice departments intervention ms molina said is 
sending a tremendously positive message to a hispanic community 
that felt they had no place to go in terms of political redress 
ms molina who was elected to represent east los angeles in 
february 1987 was one of the first politicians to benefit from the 
citys redistricting case and she believes that she has brought 
important changes to the council 
having a hispanic on the city council has created kind of an 
attitude change ms molina said before there were many 
issues that were not addressed

s beard faced off in a democratic primary today to determine who 
will try to unseat republican us sen william b roth 
voter turnout was critical in todays race the only statewide 
competition in the primary volunteers from both camps planned to 
canvass doortodoor and by telephone as well as provide 
transportation to the polls 
a light turnout was expected to favor beard who was backed by 
unions and party regulars who traditionally go to the polls in 
force 
a heavy turnout was considered good for woo whose main support 
comes from college students and younger groups 
polls opened at 7 am and were to close at 8 pm 
were making sure were real wellorganized and getting our 
people out woos deputy campaign manager jack markell said 
friday 
a poll conducted late last month for the wilmington newsjournal 
newspapers gave woo 45 percent of the vote and beard 31 percent 
twentyfour percent of the likely voters polled were undecided 
woo a 51yearold physics professor at the university of 
delaware was elected lieutenant governor four years ago in his 
first bid for public office 
a native of shanghai china he became a symbol of success by 
asianamericans

governor but instead chose to challenge roth who is seeking his 
fourth term 
however democrats complained woo is not loyal to the party and 
threw their support behind beard 
beard 49 is a former staffer of the late sen robert f 
kennedy dny he owns a nonprofit company that helps obtain 
grants to attract economic devleopment 
woo apparently won the battle for campaign donations

about 50 people attended the first 
showing of the controversial film the last temptation of 
christ after a federal judge blocked a firstinthenation 
county ordinance banning theaters from showing it 
us district judge roger vinson issued a preliminary injunction 
friday to stop enforcement of the ordinance saying it was 
unconstitutional 
vinson added that red flags should run up whenever 
government tries to violate the rights of citizens 
the ordinance had called for a maximum penalty of up to a 500 
fine and 60 days in jail for showing the film 
about a dozen pickets were at the plaza iii theaters for the 
movies debut friday but there was no violence 
in their complaint against the ordinance the movies director 
martin scorsese and plitt theaters inc said escambia county was 
the first local government to ban the film outright although 
others have passed resolutions opposing it 
county commissioners passed the ordinance on a 41 vote thursday 
on the advice of county attorney william buztrey after christian 
fundamentalists and a group called citizens against pornography 
asked for the ban 
opponents objected to the films humanizing of christ 
particularly a scene in which he has a sexual fantasy involving 
mary magdalene 
buztrey argued against the injunction contending the film was 
pornographic and patently offensive to the majority of citizens in 
the county 
it may be acceptable in los angeles new york or tampa but it 
isnt acceptable in escambia county he said 
but vinson listened to a tape recording of the emergency meeting 
and said he heard no arguments concerning either obscenity or 
violence 
the only argument made by commissioners or citizens who spoke at 
the meeting was that the film was sacreligious 
gregg thomas a lawyer representing the director and theater 
company cited rulings by the us supreme court that it is not the 
business of government to suppress real or imagined attacks on a 
particular religion 
vinson agreed the case was virtually identical to ones in which 
the high court has disallowed prior restraint of free speech or 
expression

from britain to new delhi in an ultralight aircraft in 23 days 
vijaypat singhania landed in his red and white lesprit dindian 
post to loud applause at new delhis safdarjung airport around noon 
i wanted to be an ambassador for my country and show people 
india is not just a country of snakecharmers he said i was 
running out of stories to tell my grandchildren now i have a fund 
of tales 
the 49yearold millionaire head of indias third largest 
business concern faced high winds sandstorms in the sahara desert 
and hundreds of miles of open sea sitting for hours inside the 
cramped oneseat cockpit 
singhania beat a 34day ultralight record set earlier this year 
by a british television journalist brian milton singhania 
finished the journey in 23 days having left biggin hill britain 
on august 18 
the plane weighs 330 pounds the weight of a mediumsized 
motorscooter or as singhania said the weight of an average 
couple 
it belongs to the lightest possible category of aircraft 
aditya dev a pilot with indian airlines said 
the name of the aircraft singhania said was a combination of 
his two passions the spirit of adventure and a bombaybased 
daily newspaper owned by his family the indian post 
there have been only five long flights above 5000 miles 
undertaken in a microlight aircraft said milton who was at the 
airport to congratulate singhania anyone who now attempts such a 
flight will have to beat vijay to make the record 
as he emerged from the 21feet long aircraft waving a cap 
singhania was mobbed by hundreds of people who had gathered at the 
central delhi airport after being garlanded with flowers in a 
ritual of welcome he was taken to a dais presented mementos and 
praised for having done india proud 
at a news conference later he described what had made him 
undertake the journey that was by his own admission gruelling 
i lost more than 11 kilograms 24 pounds during the trip and 
have got countless heat sores from sitting cramped in the cockpit 
so long 
flying at 10000 feet over the mediterranean my longest 
single nonstop spell of flying i saw ships and tried to visualize 
how long it would take for them to pick me up if i fell in 
singhania said 
i had a lifejacket strapped on sharkrepellent by my side 
and kept talking to my granddaughters picture that was strapped to 
the front of the cockpit to prevent myself from going crazy 
i kept my spirits up but let me tell you i was most relieved 
to see the shore at alexandria he said of the most arduous 
portion of the flight 
my most thrilling moment was this morning when i landed at 
delhi i knew i had come to the end of the journey and that i had 
established the record 
but the aviator did not seem ready to go on to further flying 
successes 
i want to sleep for four straight days before i even think of 
flying again he said i never plan to repeat the feat

two former members of a militant jewish group 
which was led by the nowprime minister yitzhak shamir admitted 
they helped kill a swedish un envoy to palestine 40 years ago an 
israeli journalist said today 
it was the first time that members of the underground group 
lohamei herut yisrael israel freedom fighters also widely known 
as the stern group confessed to the 1948 killing of count 
folke bernadotte said dan margalit of israels staterun 
educational television 
margalit told the associated press his information was based on 
interviews he conducted with yehoshua zetler and meshulam makover 
two of bernadottes killers one of the interviews was shown friday 
on educational tv 
the radical lohamei herut yisrael group headed by avraham 
stern was a splinter faction of the more mainstream group irgun 
zvai leumi the national military organization the faction 
advocated guerrilla rebellion against british rule in mandate 
palestine 
in 1942 stern was shot and killed by the british police and 
lohamei herut yisrael devised a threeman leadership of shamir 
yisrael scheibeldad and natan yellinmor with eldad serving as 
the groups ideologist 
margalit quoted zetler as saying he decided to kill bernadotte 
president of the swedish red cross during and after the world war 
ii after the envoy raised farreaching palestine partition ideas 
bernadotte was appointed in may 1948 to negotiate a ceasefire 
and recommend a settlement in israels 1948 war of independence 
zetler said he conferred with eldad and the two traveled to 
haifa to discuss it with yellinmor yellinmor demanded that after 
the killing the lohamei herut yisrael deny its role and blame the 
slaying on a tiny group of zealots called the homeland front 
margalit said 
zetler returned to jerusalem and selected three men to join him 
and makover on the mission the late yehoshua cohen ben moshe and 
another man who is still alive but refuses to disclose his 
identity margalit said they call him the fifth man the 
gingi or the redhaired one margalit said 
margalit quoted makover as saying the guerrillas arrived in two 
cars to the spot selected by zetler for the sept 17 1948 killing 
in downtown jerusalem zetler was driving a de soto car and the 
four others were in a jeep dressed in khaki shorts and peaked caps 
of the jewish army 
there was also an australian journalist who told the group 
when bernadottes convoy was due to pass margalit said without 
elaboration 
he quoted makover as saying that when bernadottes threecar 
convoy approached the narrow street the jeep blocked its way and 
three guerrillas jumped outside with makover staying behind the 
wheel 
they were supposed to find bernadottes vehicle each one 
looked inside a car and in the last vehicle cohen saw the 
envoy margalit quoted makover as saying cohen thrust the 
muzzle of his machinegun inside fired and wounded a french un 
officer 
he then backed up two steps took a careful aim fired into 
the car and killed bernadotte 
makover told margalit he ordered the two other guerrillas 
gingi and moshe to fire at the tires of the remaining cars 
when it was done they jumped into the jeep and escaped 
margalit quoted makover as saying 
the killing was widely blamed on the lohamei herut yisrael 
group and the israeli government launched a nationwide hunt for 
its members arresting 400 people among them yellinmor but the 
killers were never found

a motorist who suffered severe brain damage when 
he was beaten and thrown down a flight of stairs by two chicago 
police officers will get 35 million from the city under a 
tentative settlement officials said 
the settlement would be the largest in a police case in the 
citys history said deputy corporation counsel matthew piers 
piers testified friday before a city council committee which 
unanimously urged the full council to approve the settlement 
the spectacularly severe injuries suffered by the victim

committee 
this is the most egregious case of police brutality i have 
ever heard of said alderman edward burke a former officer 
give these poor folks the money they are certainly entitled to 
this is outrageous 
the incident began when the two officers saw acosta a former 
hotel waiter make an illegal turn in traffic officials said 
the officers julio lucotti and steven chirello followed the 
victim to his west side apartment building and beat him severely 
before throwing him down a 17step flight of stairs piers told the 
committee 
among the witnesses to the attack were acostas wife and two of 
his children 
the officers who were never disciplined and are still on duty 
said acosta fought with them and then fell down the staircase while 
handcuffed 
acosta suffered permanent brain damage and has been at elgin 
state hospital a mental institution for the past five years 
piers said acosta has undergone drastic personality changes 
evidenced by a suicide attempt physical and sexual assaults on 
strangers and frequent violent outbursts at the hospital 
the police departments office of professional standards made no 
finding of excessive use of force by the officers and cook county 
states attorney richard daley declined to prosecute piers said 
ops is like a big washing machine alderman anna langford 
said everything goes in dirty and comes out clean we had better 
take this settlement and run

the struggle for democracy in burma is 
threatening the nations food supply causing shortages of gasoline 
and increasing prices of fruits and vegetables diplomats said 
saturday 
western diplomatic personnel interviewed here said shortages of 
food and other supplies were widespread in rangoon burmas 
capital even the exclusive rangoon store at which diplomats shop 
has run out of rice they said 
diplomats are among the only residents who can still tap the 
virtually exhausted fuel supply many burmese have had to walk up 
to 15 miles to take part in antigovernment demonstrations they 
said 
the demonstrations prompted the government saturday to end 26 
years of singleparty rule and announce that general elections will 
be held under a multiparty system 
embassies and foreign organizations sent more than 230 
dependents and nonessential staffers to bangkok friday on a 
special thai airways flight leaving about 400 others awaiting 
evacuation 
diplomats said the evacuees included americans australians 
filipinos malaysians indonesians british japanese south 
koreans soviets and thais 
despite widespread looting and increasing violence in the 
burmese capital the diplomats insisted they were evacuated 
strictly as a precautionary measure and said they hope to return 
soon 
the diplomatic store is supposed to have rice but it has not 
had it for a week or so said one diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity diplomatic personnel have the same 
shortages as everyone else we get fresh food at the markets but in 
limited supplies and it has become very expensive 
we diplomats are in the happy position of having freezers 
and everyone has been gobbling up the food in their freezers 
because they are afraid the electricity will go off 
the food shortage has occurred mainly because strikes and a fuel 
shortage have made it very difficult to get commodities into the 
capital but the diplomat said hoarding is also to blame 
indeed other diplomats have said the military has been hoarding 
goods in an attempt to starve the people into submission 
another western diplomat also speaking anonymously said a 
small bag of rice in rangoon was selling for 600 kyats 100 
and the average person makes less than 400 kyats 67 a month 
vegetables and fruit are still around but the prices have gone up 
a lot 
a lack of gasoline has kept most buses from operating so a 
lot of people have to walk the diplomat said 
thousands of people had to walk 15 miles or more to get into 
town for a prodemocracy rally friday she said they passed 
our diplomatic compound for more than an hour then they had to 
walk home again 
you see almost no cars except for those owned by 
diplomats she added the few buses running are packed you see 
25 people sitting on the top of them a lot of people are not going 
to work because of the transportation problem 
both diplomats said the foreign community had no fear of the 
massive crowds that have rallied in rangoon almost daily for 
several weeks to press for an end to oneparty rule and an interim 
government to lead the country to democracy but the crowds have 
made it difficult to move about 
there are a million out walking but they are gentle 
goodnatured the first diplomat said there are reports that 
youngsters have been attacked by military intelligence people but 
they soldiers are not interested in foreigners 
there have been such huge crowds that if you wanted to get 
from one side of the city to the other you had to wait for an hour 
and a half for the protesters to pass the diplomat said then 
you go one block and they are snaking back again 
during the day everything is ok but at night there are a lot 
of robbers and looters out and it is not safe

santiago chile on the 15th anniversary of the bloody coup 
that installed him only for as long as circumstances demand 
president gen augusto pinochet is eagerly pursuing a new 
eightyear mandate 
he remains firmly in control of the military but an 
increasingly unified and confident opposition predicts his 
political demise before the anniversary rolls around again next 
year 
commander of the countrys fiercely disciplined army pinochet 
led the sept 11 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of 
a marxist salvador allende during a period of widespread social 
and economic upheaval 
that same day the armed forces solemnly announced by radio that 
they were assuming power only for as long as circumstances demand 
it the statement was interpreted by most chileans that a return 
to the long tradition of democratic rule would be swift 
instead a decade and a half later pinochet has launched a huge 
campaign to persuade his countrymen that circumstances demand he 
remain in power until 1997 and that they they must vote accordingly 
in an oct 5 presidential referendum 
in a clear demonstration that his military power base remains 
strong pinochet recently won the quick and unanimous backing of 
his fellow armed forces commanders for his sole candidacy in the 
referendum 
the 72yearold general had been campaigning hard for the 
nomination and had behind him the fervent backing of the army by 
far the most powerful military branch 
if he wins the referendum he will begin a new eightyear term 
next march 11 if he loses he remains in power another year until 
an open election is called and will hand power over to the winner 
in march 1990 
whether he wins or loses a congress will be elected in 1990 for 
the first time since it was disbanded at the time of the coup but 
the legislature will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980 
constitution crafted by pinochets administration that gives the 
military autonomy and a strong supervisory role in national affairs 
most polls how pinochet lacking sufficient voter support in an 
evident bid to increase his popularity he has been easing 
political restrictions and cultivating a new conciliatory image 
that contrasts with his harshly authoritarian reputation 
he decreed an end to states of emergency in effect since he took 
power and lifted a ban on the return of all leftists in exile many 
of them were expelled or fled during a wave of fierce repression 
that followed the coup 
lets bury in forgetfulness that which keeps us apart 
pinochet declared to critics in an open letter published by 
santiago newspapers last week 
in speech after speech he maintains that chile needs his strong 
leadership to wrap up reforms that will produce a new democracy 
with effective safeguards against international marxism and a 
strongfree market economy 
a saturation campaign of progovernment advertisements on 
television radio and in the press contends that his defeat would 
mean a return to the political and social chaos of the allende 
years it protrays his leading critics as politically bankrupt 
quarrelsome hacks intent on personal gain 
but after years of deep division 16 opposition parties ranging 
from centerright to far left have united in an unusually coherent 
effort to defeat pinochet at the ballot box 
the coalition called the command for the no vote has launched 
its own lowbudget but well organized campaign its advertisements 
recall pinochets promises not to remain in power forever and 
declare no more lies 
opposition leaders who once spent most of their time arguing now 
appear together at antigovernment rallies and forums declaring 
confidently that pinochets days are numbered a sept 4 rally 
attracted more than 100000 people in what organizers called the 
biggest antigovernment demonstration since the coup 
they also have agreed on a general political platform that 
promises greater emphasis on social benefits but no revolutionary 
economic or political changes if pinochet loses the referendum 
they plan negotiations with the armed forces to speed up his 
departure amend the constitution and hold quick elections for a 
fouryear transition government 
genero arrigiada a centrist christian democrat who is 
secretarygeneral of the coalition said the oppositions new unity 
is the result of a long and painful maturing process 
he said party leaders now realize that their own infighting 
allowed pinochet to seize power and to retain it 
just as sept 11 1973 was the culmination of a deep 
political division this campaign is the expression of just the 
opposite he said its the end of the war between the 
parties 
asked if he expected pinochet to still be in power next sept 
11 he replied no this is the last one

the law and order minister 
described archbishop desmond tutu on saturday as a tragic and 
misled person who is challenging the government on the orders of 
revolutionaries 
also saturday a newspaper reported that prominent afrikaner 
politicians and academics including the brother of a cabinet 
minister will meet next month with soviet policymakers and black 
nationalist guerrilla leaders 
adriaan vlok the law and order minister said revolutionaries 
have decided that tutu leader of the anglican church in southern 
africa should create incidents to embarrass south africa 
during the us presidential campaign and the current visit to the 
region by pope john paul ii 
vlok who oversees the national police force was reacting to 
tutus recent defiance of an emergency regulation forbidding calls 
for an election boycott 
three times in the past week tutu has urged blacks and whites 
to boycott next months municipal elections which many blacks view 
as an entrenchment of segregated whitecontrolled political 
structures 
police are investigating tutus statements to determine whether 
he should be prosecuted 
vlok in a speech reported by the staterun south african 
broadcasting corp said naive church leaders are being misused 
by the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement and 
south african communist party 
vlok said tutu out of personal ambition is playing a key role 
in a campaign to bring the country to its knees 
the argus a cape town daily said 18 white south africans will 
travel to munich west germany in late october for a sixday 
conference 
they will meet with officials of the african national congress 
guerrilla movement and with a soviet delegation that will include 
at least two deputy directors of the african institute of the 
soviet academy of sciences it said 
south african authorities have discouraged contacts with the 
african national congress the organization is outlawed in south 
africa and wages a bombing and sabotage campaign to undermine the 
afrikanerdominated government 
according to the argus the delegation heading to munich will 
include willem de klerk a former newspaper editor whose brother 
frederik de klerk is minister of education and a possible 
candidate to succeed president pw botha 
others in the group reportedly will include wynand malan a 
parliament member who heads the small antiapartheid national 
democratic movement and frederik van zyl slabbert former leader 
of the liberal progressive federal party malan and slabbert have 
met with anc officials previously 
afrikaners descended from dutch and other northern european 
settlers make up about 60 percent of south africas 5 million 
whites 
many afrikaners have broken with bothas national party in 
recent years some to the left because of disenchantment with 
apartheid and a far larger number to the right to protest what 
they perceive as concessions to blacks 
under apartheid the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the white minority controls the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

except for choosing texts and shaping the 
curriculum most teachers feel left out of critical decisions 
affecting classroom life according to a nationwide poll released 
saturday 
ten percent or fewer of 21698 public school teachers surveyed 
by the carnegie foundation for the advancment of teaching felt they 
had any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new 
teachers and administrators just 20 percent believed they were 
influential in tailoring school budgets 
the report endorses what i have often said that teachers are 
treated like very tall children instead of professionals said 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association the nations largest teacher union with 19 million 
members 
on the positive side 79 percent of those surveyed said they 
felt involved in choosing textbooks and instructional materials 
and 63 percent said they had a say in shaping the curriculum 
a report on the results teacher involvement in 
decisionmaking a statebystate profile revealed wide 
disparities in the degree of involvement teachers felt in different 
states 
in vermont for example 93 percent of teachers reported a high 
level of involvement in choosing textbooks 85 percent said they 
helped shape the curriculum and 50 percent said they were involved 
in setting student promotion policies 
but only 63 percent of louisiana teachers said they helped 
choose texts 40 percent said they were involved in shaping the 
curriculum 36 percent had a say in tracking students into special 
classes and just 1 percent felt they had influence in selecting 
new teachers 
the evidence shows that in many matters that are important to 
building a good school teachers have not been very much 
involved foundation president ernest l boyer said in an 
interview 
boyer said school reformers must find a middle ground a way to 
involve teachers while maintaining a sensible monitoring and 
support role for state education officials 
americas school reform movement is at a crossroads he said 
in a forward to the report during the past five years academic 
requirements have been tightened standards have been raised but 
most of the mandates for reform have been imposed topdown and 
were beginning to discover that outside regulation has its 
limits 
the 50state teacher survey was conducted by mail in the spring 
of 1987 by the wirthlin group a polling organization in mclean 
va the poll had a margin of error of less than plus or minus 1 
percent for nationwide findings 
among other results 
47 percent of all surveyed said they felt involved in setting 
standards of student conduct the range was 68 percent among oregon 
teachers to 37 percent in florida new jersey and rhode island 
45 percent reported having influence in tracking students into 
special classes the high was minnesota at 63 percent louisiana 
was the lowest at 36 percent

president maung maung said burmas ruling 
party decided today to end 26 years of singleparty rule and to 
hold a general election under a multiparty system 
the decision was a victory for opposition leaders and for 
hundreds of thousands of burmese who have taken to the streets in 
sometimes violent demonstrations that have toppled two presidents 
in three months 
speaking before 968 delegates at a special party congress the 
president admitted that major errors were commmitted by the party 
and said the interests of the people were paramount 
power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely he 
said in a speech carried by the stateowned radio rangoon he 
pledged a free and fair general election will be held as soon as 
possible but gave no date 
the broadcast announcer said the decision was unanimously 
adopted by the delegates of the burma socialist program party 
maung maung said a party emergency session of parliament on 
sunday will make necessary amendments to the constitution to adopt 
the multiparty system and also to form an independent commission to 
supervise the elections 
he urged government employes who have left their jobs in 
sympathy with the prodemocracy movement to return to their jobs 
so the government can function 
the special party congress was originally scheduled for monday 
to decide whether a referendum on oneparty rule would be called 
radio rangoon said the delegates today decided to scrap the 
referendum idea and to go ahead with elections under a multiparty 
system 
todays announcement came one day after former prime minister u 
nu toppled in a 1962 military coup announced the formation of a 
rival government to take power from maung maung it was not 
immediately clear how todays development would affect u nus plan 
which was not supported by all opposition figures 
also friday about 500 renegade soldiers joined protesters 
demanding formation of an interim government and full democracy it 
was the first major defection of troops to the opposition 
the moves followed weeks of massive occasionally bloody turmoil 
in this isolated southeast asian nation that left dozens of people 
dead unofficial reports said the death toll could be in the 
hundreds from street riots that broke out in july 
in a letter to embassies on friday 82yearold u nu called for 
general elections oct 9 he announced a cabinet with himself as 
prime minister former president mahn win maung as president and 
retired gen tin oo a vocal critic of the current authoritarian 
leadership as defense minister 
however tin oo and two other members of the rival cabinet 
retired military commanders aung shwe and saw myint resigned 
today and reliable sources said u nu had not consulted them about 
his move the bar council of burma said students and other 
opposition groups also had not been consulted 
the three men also said in a statement that they were resigning 
from a league for democracy and peace that u nu had formed earlier 
to oppose the maung maungs government 
aung san suu kyi an opposition figure and daughter of slain 
independence leader aung san told reporters the announcement of a 
multiparty system was a positive step but said it could take 
up to two years to form parties to contest in general elections 
under the present economic and political situation an interim 
government will be the best solution it the interim government 
would deal with economic problems and also hold general 
elections she told reporters 
another opposition leader retired gen aung gyi said he 
doubted the prevailing situation will permit holding of general 
elections under the present government 
toru ohno a japanese burma specialist at osaka university said 
the fact that the ruling party took action two days ahead of 
its original schedule means that maung maungs government can 
no longer control or suppress protest im glad the party made the 
compromise in an effort to seek a peaceful and democratic 
settlement 
ne win led the 1962 coup that toppled u nu ne win resigned as 
head of the ruling party in july citing in part widespread street 
protests in march and june riots flared when the party chose sein 
lwin to succeed ne win sein lwin is a hardliner widely hated for 
his brutal suppression of dissidents 
the government said 112 people died in antigovernment 
demonstrations but diplomats estimated hundreds were killed 
sein lwin resigned aug 12 after 17 days in power and maung 
maung was named to replace him maung maung was burmas first 
civilian leader in 26 years but protests and nationwide strikes 
continued as opponents demanded an immediate end to oneparty rule

postmaster general anthony frank wants to 
bring americas generations closer together and if that brings the 
post office a little extra business he wont mind 
plant a family tree is the name of franks plan in which 
millions of family history forms will be given out in hopes that 
youngsters will write to their grandparents seeking information to 
fill them out 
letters provide an important link between families 
grandparents often meet their grandchildren through an exchange of 
letters and photographs long before they see each other 
facetoface frank said 
but it isnt just a business proposition says frank he could 
generate more business by concentrating on big advertisers and 
catalog companies 
the postal service is part of the fabric of american life we 
do more than deliver the mail we deliver ideas and dreams and help 
preserve our heritage he says 
as part of the family tree program the postal service has 
printed millions of folders which discuss family histories on one 
side and contain a genealogical form on the back to fill in 
information on parents grandparents and greatgrandparents 
the forms will be available free in post offices by the first 
week in october 
to get things started frank invited 27 third graders from dale 
city va to his washington office on friday to hear about the 
project and mail letters to their grandparents letters likely to 
get special treatment since they were handed directly to the 
postmaster general 
its just finding out about a generation you dont have much 
contact with frank said of his hopes for the program its 
children asking tell me about yourself gramps tell me about my 
parents when they were my age 
what a compliment to be asked about yourself by 
grandchildren frank added in an interview 
many youngsters will probably telephone for information of 
course but frank noted nostalgically you dont tie ribbons 
around old phone calls in the attic 
in some countries generations live together and get to know 
each other but thats not often the way in america as a result 
children tend not to know their grandparents very well frank 
explained to the youngsters 
were running out of glue in this country people are no 
longer as family oriented people are no longer as community 
oriented this is a try to bring the family together frank 
said 
victor hurst of the 30million member american association of 
retired persons hailed the program as a way of increasing harmony 
among people from different generations 
you can be sure our grandmothers and grandfathers will be as 
excited as can be to help all the grandchildren around the nation 
fill in the blanks in their family trees hurst said 
frank noted that only after becoming an adult do many people 
realize what they missed if they were not close to grandparents 
and by that time it is often too late 
in addition to providing a form for starting a family tree the 
folder includes tips on pursuing a more detailed family background 
including suggested sources for genealogical information such as 
the census national archives and national genealogical society

pope john paul ii arrived in harare 
today on the first leg of a pilgrimage to five blackruled nations 
bordering raciallytroubled south africa 
before leaving rome on the 10day journey the pontiff said he 
hopes he can help solve some of whiteled south africas problems 
on a future trip there 
his fourth journey to africa and his 39th abroad will be to 
botswana lesotho mozambique swaziland and zimbabwe all 
countries less than 20 years old that vehemently oppose south 
africa but depend on it for economic survival 
in an unusual statement friday the vatican emphasized the pope 
was not snubbing south africa and hoped to visit the country in the 
future it said the popes full schedule on this trip made a stop 
there impossible 
the statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruled 
out a visit to south africa where a white minority rules 26 
million blacks 
during nearly 10 years at the helm of the roman catholic church 
john paul has strongly denounced apartheid 
no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be 
acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races 
he said in a 1985 address in the netherlands 
in may the pontiff received anglican archbishop and 1984 nobel 
peace prize winner desmond tutu who defiantly invited arrest and 
prosecution sunday by urging a boycott of oct 26 municipal 
elections in south africa 
tutus challenge to the government came two days after the south 
african law and order minister adriaan vlok said the time had 
come to clip the wings of church leaders who hide behind the 
mask of liberation theology earlier this week police armed 
with a search warrant seized a tape of tutus sermon at the 
archbishops cape town office 
when the pope greeted tutu and other south african clergymen in 
may he said the system of racial segregation has exacted a 
terrible toll tutu urged tougher sanctions by western nations 
an issue on which the vatican has not taken a position 
south african roman catholic bishops who have worked closely 
with anglicans were waiting for the pope at his first stop in the 
zimbabwe capital of harare they are attending a conference of 
regional bishops there 
after a meeting with zimbabwe president robert mugabe the pope 
planned to address the 71 bishops in a dominican convent the 
speech one of 42 drafted during a summer vacation in the 
mountains was expected to set the tone for the 12400mile voyage 
in a document issued two years ago the vatican said it was 
perfectly legitimate for the oppressed to take action such as 
passive resistance to secure structures and institutions in which 
their rights would be respected 
but it warned clergy against direct involvement in politics and 
against any efforts to inject marxism into church work on behalf of 
the poor

the floods that inundate this poor 
overpopulated nation with deadly regularity are a combination of 
manmade and natural phenomena 
this years deluge the most devastating in memory has 
claimed more than 600 lives by government count and more than 1400 
according to newspapers it has submerged threequarters of the 
country spawning disease and destroying homes roads bridges 
schools and food warehouses 
from the air bangladesh looks like a large brown sea with 
atolls where the map shows cities towns and villages individual 
rivers can no longer be discerned 
the deluge comes just one year after a flood covered half the 
country and claimed about 300 lives by government count and about 
1500 according to newspapers 
bangladesh a country born in 1971 is seemingly condemned to 
repeated disasters 
the 197071 war of independence from pakistan killed 3 million 
people according to the government since then floods cyclones 
and tidal waves have claimed at least 20000 lives even in the dry 
season overcrowded river ferries sink regularly with losses of 
life that often exceed 100 
bangladeshis meet this cycle of tragedy with acceptance that 
often bewilders outsiders and has its roots in the islamic 
religion again and again people lose their homes and their 
families but not their faith they repeat it is the will of 
allah god 
some of the causes of the disasters are internal such as a 
birthrate that has made bangladesh one of the worlds most densely 
populated nations others such as the floods originate beyond its 
borders and beyond its control 
a series of historic shifts drew the borders that define 
bangladesh 
when britishruled india won its independence in 1947 the 
borders of the asian subcontinent dissolved and became two new 
countries predominantly hindu india and overwhelmingly moslem 
east and west pakistan 
the division left lowlying bangladesh then known as east 
pakistan with little more than an overpopulated river delta barely 
above sea level 
east pakistan separated from west pakistan by 1000 miles of 
india was virtually defenseless against flood waters that cascade 
from the mountains of neighboring india and nepal 
obviously india got the better deal said nazrul islam 
chairman of dhaka universitys geography department i think they 
had stronger negotiators more money more knowledgeable and 
educated people 
india got the oil fields of the assam region as well as west 
bengal with its port of calcutta a hub of industry education and 
government east pakistan got east bengal a region of poor 
farmers with rice paddies and jute fields it also got the poor 
area of assam including a few tea plantations 
today indian assam pumps 96000 barrels of oil a day 
bangladesh finally struck oil there in 1986 but it is only pumping 
about 600 barrels a day 
if pakistan hadnt asked for the area with the moslems it 
wouldnt have gotten bangladesh said an indian diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity calcutta and the oil were in 
hindu areas 
the 1971 civil war when the bengalispeaking east pakistanis 
rose against their urduspeaking rulers from west pakistan created 
the independent nation of bangladesh but the new nation free of 
the west pakistanbased government was even further deprived of 
the economic strength to combat natural disasters 
bangladesh has a per capita income of 150 a year compared to 
371 in pakistan and 260 in india 
the population density is already 2000 people per square mile 
the third highest in the world after the prosperous citystates of 
hong kong and singapore 
in the past 41 years bangladeshs population has swelled from 
40 million to 110 million at the present birth rate the 
population will double in about 35 years 
after the war of independence the nations few resources and 
defenses against disasters were further eroded 
greedy contractors and poor farmers in search of fuel felled 
entire forests on the himalayan slopes in india and nepal the 
deforestation eliminated vast tracts that had helped retain flood 
waters and held back the silt that clogs the rivers and aggravates 
flooding 
bangladeshis have virtually no place to live except on the 
plains of rivers that overflow every year when rainswollen 
currents rush through the width and breadth of bangladesh to the 
bay of bengal 
the mightiest of the rivers the brahmaputra which starts in 
china and flows through tibet and india the ganges which 
originates in nepal and runs through india and the meghna which 
rises in india are up to 12 miles wide under normal conditions 
and spawn hundreds of tributaries 
a cry rose arose from bangladeshis for regional cooperation to 
find an ecological solution to the onslaughts on a country former 
us secretary of state henry a kissinger termed an 
international basket case 
the call repeated last week by bangladeshs president hussain 
muhammad ershad has gone largely unheeded 
ten years ago there was a proposal for the himalayan 
ecosystem said erling dessau head of the united nations 
development program in bangladesh there wasnt much interest in 
it

the 70th annual convention of the 
american legion as conservative a conclave as one was likely to 
find last week was in high spirits for speeches by president 
reagan and vice president george bush 
but some booed the mere mention of michael dukakis 
so why did the democratic presidential nominee bother to show 
hed be foolish not to face the troops said retired marine 
andrew steffanic commander of the california legion 
the massachusetts governor could not afford to ignore the 
nations largest veterans organization even if he felt like he 
wasnt going to sway the first vote said legionnaire nathan 
wolfe 
it would be detrimental to his campaign the legion is almost 
3 million strong said wolfe 58 of north augusta sc 
democrat walter mondale clearly was no favorite of this group 
when he ran against reagan four years ago but he toughed it 
out at the legions 1984 convention steffanic said 
mondale paused in his speech which to that point had been 
received in stony silence and jokingly advised his audience it was 
ok to applaud that brought laughter but he was no match 
whatsoever for reagan said steffanic 67 of portola calif 
dukakis pitch before the american legion on thursday included 
assurances that he favored a strong national defense use of force 
against terrorists and a cabinetlevel post for veterans affairs 
he also lashed out at the reagan administration for closing 
hospitals clinics and counseling centers and touted programs in 
massachusetts for homeless or unemployed veterans 
an awful lot of guys who heard that speech were swayed said 
john walsh 36 a lawyer disabled air force veteran and dukakis 
supporter from quincy mass he focused on the needs of veterans 
and the other two guys reagan and bush totally failed to do so 
another massachusetts delegate alfred harwood of lynn 
disagreed 
i know some of the veterans affairs that go on in 
massachusetts and what dukakis says up here and what he does 
doesnt agree harwood said as far as the defense of this 
country is concerned i would have to agree with bush im not 
going to vote for dukakis 
navy veteran george ellerkamp 65 said he was for bush before 
and after the convention 
even though bush seemed nervous including his blunder 
wednesday about sept 7 being pearl harbor day and although 
veterans in general agree with dukakis that the va is in decline 
ellerkamp said dukakis said nothing to make him change his mind 
i felt like both bush and dukakis told us what we wanted to 
hear said ellerkamp of st matthews ky 
also veterans dont blame reagan for cutting back va services 
ellerkamp said they blame the system not any individual he 
said 
walsh said most of those attending the convention were veterans 
of world war ii and korea older men who own homes hold 
established jobs or have retired and have little in common with 
vietnamera veterans 
if you can afford to come to a national convention you 
certainly arent representative of the average veteran on the 
street he said 
dukakis reception was far politer than might have been expected 
after sen dennis deconcini dariz a staunch advocate of 
veterans in congress was booed wednesday for urging the 
legionnaires to listen attentatively to dukakis message 
the heckling brought a stern rebuke from legion national cmdr 
john p jake comer also of massachusetts 
we will do our booing in the voting booth in november comer 
said

at stake in the voters choice between george 
bush and michael dukakis in november is the delicate balance 
between liberal and conservative justices that has set the supreme 
courts ideological course in recent years 
when the next president takes office the three oldest and most 
liberal justices on the ninemember high court will be over 80 
the average age of the courts liberal wing will be a bit over 
77 the average age of its conservative bloc will be 59 
bush almost certainly would appoint far more conservative 
justices as president than dukakis would 
four years ago there were predictions that reagan would have 
the chance to decide the future of an aging supreme court for 
generations to come but things didnt work out that way 
there is no question that the court is younger and more 
conservative than it was at the start of reagans second term but 
liberal justices still exert critical influence and reagans 
opportunity to turn the court into a conservative stronghold has 
passed 
in this election year however predictions of sweeping changes 
in the supreme court in the next four years seem more likely to 
come true 
the nine justices enjoy lifetime tenure none is reported to 
have grave health problems and none has made any public mention of 
retirement plans 
the courts leading liberals are justices william j brennan 
82 thurgood marshall 80 and harry a blackmun soon to be 80 
justice john paul stevens 68 often joins them particularly in 
criminal law decisions 
the courts conservative bloc is led by chief justice william h 
rehnquist 63 its most conservative member is antonin scalia 52 
in varying degrees the conservatives are bolstered by justices 
sandra day oconnor 58 anthony kennedy 52 and byron r white 
71 
unlike reagan and democratic nominee walter mondale in 1984 the 
two presidential candidates this year have virtually ignored the 
high court and their vision of its future in their stump speeches 
vice president bush has noted that the next president will 
very possibly appoint two or three justices to the supreme court 
where theyll sit well into the next century 
bush promises to appoint judges who will interpret the 
constitution not legislate from the bench he also says he will 
appoint judges who dont reserve all their sympathy for 
criminals who understand that victims have rights too 
the unspoken message appears to be that bush like reagan is 
determined to select conservative justices who could sway the high 
courts balance of power on such issues as abortion and affirmative 
action 
the court for years has been drifting toward more conservative 
views regarding the rights of criminal suspects 
as governor of massachusetts dukakis has appointed numerous 
judges who generally have been more liberal than conservative 
however they are screened by an 18member nonideological merit 
commission 
speculation about the impact that bush or dukakis might have on 
the supreme court depends on who they would nominate and which 
justices would be replaced 
reagan named oconnor to the court in 1981 since 1984 he has 
appointed scalia and kennedy 
all three are more conservative then the men they replaced but 
reagan did not have a chance to place a conservative in a seat 
formerly held by a liberal 
oconnor succeeded potter stewart scalia was a numerical 
replacement for retired chief justice warren e burger after 
rehnquist was elevated to chief justice and kennedy succeeded 
retired justice lewis f powell 
the national law journal recently asked 40 court observers 
including campaign officials former white house aides federal 
judges law professors and lawyers to speculate on possible 
nominees of bush and dukakis 
the 10 people named most often as potential bush nominees in 
alphabetical order were 
james a baker 58 former white house chief of staff who is 
the bush campaign chairman 
c boyden gray 45 the vice presidents legal adviser since 
1981

everyone showed up but the guest of honor as 
friends and former colleagues of an aircraft engineer who went to 
lunch one day and never came back held their annual party on his 
behalf 
members of the crowd that gathered at tequila willies saloon amp 
grill in trendy manhattan beach on friday said the disappearance 
seven years ago of ed greer symbolized rebellion against the 
corporate world 
richard connett greers old boss at the hughes aircraft co 
said others himself included have sometimes thought of 
disappearing when the pressures of family and job began to get to 
them but ed really did it 
hughes is full of very straightlaced people said sherry 
mcculloh greers former secretary he is the anomaly there is a 
little bizarreness in all of us 
meanwhile partygoers wore ed masks and borrowing the 
where was george catch phrase from this years democratic 
national convention asked where is ed 
greer an electronics engineer still in his early 30s and 
already on the fast track at hughes cleaned out his files on sept 
9 1981 and disappeared a day later leaving behind a wife of 12 
years and two young sons 
hughes officials found his car one day later with his wallet 
and clothing inside near the beach in venice 
but the theory that he drowned quickly evaporated when another 
hughes employee reported spotting greer dressed in jeans at los 
angeles international airport around midnight the day he 
disappeared 
you havent seen me the 6foot2 bearded greer told the 
man and a cult figure was born 
when an investigation determined that his flight was not an act 
of espionage greer had access to classified information greers 
colleagues let their imaginations run free 
employees started keeping pictures of greer around the office 
sometimes pasting cutouts of his smiling face on other pictures to 
show him on the beach or embraced with a bathing beauty 
and every year since the disappearance hughes employees 
celebrate the anniversary of his flight the parties attract people 
who didnt even know greer 
you can think of all kinds of bad things that might have 
happened to him ms mcculloh said i like to think it was good 
things 
she said she likes to think he wound up in mexico or the 
bahamas where he is leading the good life 
but not everyone is amused 
im kind of irritated about this party business said 
greers former wife kit who divorced him after he disappeared 
i know engineers it is mildy amusing to them

defense secretary frank c carlucci on 
saturday wrapped up his visit to china leaving the chinese happy 
about a us decision that could permit chinese rockets to launch 
us satellites 
carlucci also said he was satisfied that the chinese would 
exercise prudence in their arms sales to the middle east and other 
areas of the world 
carlucci said he conveyed the us decision about satellites to 
national defense minister qin jiwei 
he was most pleased with that carlucci told reporters at 
the wusong naval facility in shanghai 
the reagan administration on friday announced it would give 
export licenses for satellites manufactured by hughes aircraft that 
are scheduled to be launched for australian and hong kong companies 
with chinas long march rocket 
the decision must be approved by the us congress and a group 
of western allies that monitor hightechnology transfers 
hong kongbased asiasat is to put a satellite in orbit next 
year while aussat from australia will launch two satellites in 
1991 and 1992 using the chinese service 
carlucci said he had recommended to washington that the licenses 
be approved 
the settling of the satellite issue was the second major area of 
friction solved during carluccis first trip to china 
in beijing on thursday he told a news conference that he was 
fully satisfied with chinas statement that it would exercise 
prudence in its arms sales to the middle east and other areas of 
the world 
carlucci and defense department officials did not elaborate 
he said his talks were the best discussions weve had on the 
subject 
the united states was concerned that chinese sales of 
mediumrange missiles to saudi arabia and proposed sales to other 
middle east countries would upset the regional military balance 
qin jiwei told reporters that chinese arms sales were small 
compared to those of the united states and were carried out 
responsibly 
carlucci was led by navy cmdr zhang lianzhong on a 50minute 
tour of the wusong base he called the visit a sign of efforts to 
have exchanges with the entire range of the chinese military 
the defense secretary left after the tour for a flight to hong 
kong

a japanese official said saturday he hopes 
president reagan will veto a bill approved by the us senate to 
curb textile imports to the united states 
it is regrettable that the us senate approved the bill 
ignoring the fact that us textile exports have increased and the 
industry did not perform as badly as many people believed said 
chang changhan acting secretary general of the taiwan textile 
federation 
the senate by a 5732 vote friday approved new curbs on 
textile clothing and shoe imports the bill still needs approval 
by the house of representatives before it can be sent to president 
ronald reagan 
the bill would freeze this years imports of textiles apparel 
and nonrubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their growth to 1 
percent annually thereafter 
we hope president reagan will veto the bill if it is passed by 
the house chang said such a protectionist measure will only 
hurt american consumers who would have to pay higher prices for 
textile products 
the united states has been taiwans largest market for textile 
goods last year taiwans apparel and textile exports to the 
united states totaled 32 billion up 14 percent from 1986 
during a meeting in tokyo saturday with visiting us commerce 
secretary c william verity the japanese minister of international 
trade and industry hajime tamura expressed hope that the bill 
would be vetoed by reagan because of its protectionist nature 
a ministry official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
japanese government had issued no formal reaction to the bill 
however 
in hong kong a leading trade official said the bill was 
unnecessary and unlikely to survive a presidential veto 
the bill is totally unnecessary and inappropriate because 
the us textile industry has been doing well said miranda chiu 
acting assistant director of trade for the exportfueled british 
colony 
any protectionist measure would definitely have adverse 
effects on exporting countries such as hong kong chiu said 
she said it would be difficult to gauge the precise impact on the 
colony because the bill does not provide details on how it would be 
implemented 
exports from hong kong of apparel and clothing accessories to 
the united states reached 34 billion in 1986 up 9 percent from 
the previous year according to the census and statistics 
department 
exports of textile fabrics to the united states totaled 116 
million in 1986 up 11 percent from 1985 it said

major environmental groups some of them no 
friends of the reagan administration have jumped to the defense of 
federal forest firefighting policies attacked by some western 
members of congress 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo last week suggested that william 
penn mott director of the national park service be fired for 
following a let it burn policy in yellowstone national park 
environmental spokesmen accused wallop of grandstanding and 
called his suggestion ridiculous 
members of congress who lead the committees overseeing the 
parks also heavily critical of the administraion at times 
defended the firefighting policy 
i applaud the president and the secretary of the interior 
for standing firm against wallops suggestion said paul 
pritchard president of the national parks and conservation 
association and a critic who has rarely applauded them for anything 
those who jump up in the midst of a major catastrophe and cry 
bloody murder and off with their heads remind me of alice in 
wonderland pritchard said 
interior secretary donald p hodel one of the threemember 
inspection team sent by president reagan to yellowstone over the 
weekend has called the firefighting policy a disaster 
the disaster remark was clearly intended as hindsight 
said spokesman alan levitt and hodel stands by an earlier 
statement that what the park service and other agencies need now 
is our understanding of the difficulties they face and our 
support 
the park service since 1972 has followed a socalled let it 
burn policy which fights forest fires caused by humans and 
natural fires that threaten human lives and property but lets most 
natural fires burn for the benefits they bring to forest 
regeneration 
a century of fuel buildup from suppressing fires yellowstone 
was declared a park in 1872 are worsening fires today some 
suggested 
theres been a lot of inaccurate information passed around 
said tim mahoney of the sierra club because of the drought 
these fires are going to get away from you no matter what the 
policy is 
sen dale bumpers dark chairman of the national parks 
subcommittee of the senate energy and natural resources committee 
toured yellowstone in august 
i dont mind telling you i was glad to get out of there 
because of the fire danger and the fuel buildup said bumpers on 
friday there were as many trees on the ground as there were 
standing 
the fire management policies of the park service and the 
forest service are sound flexible and scientifically based we 
support them said a statement by george frampton president of 
the wilderness society 
referring to hodels disaster remark wilderness society 
spokesman ben beach said i thinking hes hanging mott out to 
dry mott has been one of the bright spots in an awful record 
we think the calls for mott to resign are ridiculous said 
robert sangeorge spokesman for the national audubon society in new 
york 
though we dont favor letting peoples houses burn down were 
concerned that calling for motts dismissal would be the popular 
thing to do to respond to people who are concerned about their 
property sangeorge said politics should not intrude on 
biology 
bumpers has promised a hearing on the fires at the request of 
sen john melcher dmont after the fires are out 
yellowstone superintendent bob barbee oughtnt be made a 
scapegoat and bill mott oughtnt be made a scapegoat bumpers 
said 
are you going to fire forest service chief dale robertson 
the forest service fought every fire there are fires burning out 
of control in washington state right now on forest service 
land bumpers said there are some places where mother nature 
takes control and man just cant do anything 
im not interested in hearing from bill mott or don hodel but 
guys who know something about fire and horticulturists bumpers 
said were going to have a serious review im not going to 
permit it to degenerate into vindictiveness and i dont think sen 
wallop or sen melcher who both serve on my subcommittee want 
that 
rep bruce vento dminn chairman of the counterpart house 
subcommittee said the policies are appropriate plans for 
fighting fires in yellowstone have been on paper for a very long 
time well review the policies well learn things 
vento said he believed wallop is trying to find a scapegoat 
and i dont think thats appropriate 
jay d hair executive vice president of the national wildlife 
federation with 5 million members the nations largest 
conservation group said i dont think this is the time for 
political grandstanding and i think that is precisely what sen 
wallop is doing 
derrick crandall president of the american recreation 
coalition a trade association containing tourist and recreation 
businesses said he had spoken with wallop a few weeks ago and he 
feels the park service wasnt listening to his concerns and those 
of his constituents 
i understand the frustration of sen wallop crandall said 
there are very good arguments for the letitburn policy and i 
think most people in the recreationtourism community understand 
that 
but he said i dont have all the facts and im not going to 
suggest we know at this point what director mott should or should 
not have done

the government today ordered a vietnamese diplomat 
who confronted demonstrators with a gun outside his embassy to 
leave britain 
an announcement by the foreign office said vietnamese third 
secretary khang than nhan must leave the country by sunday 
vietnamese ambassador tran van hung pressed by the british 
government about khangs actions sept 4 turned over a toy gun on 
thursday 
but today he gave a real gun to junior foreign office minister 
timothy eggar and said it was the one khang was holding when he 
confronted vietnamese refugees protesting in front of the embassy 
the foreign office said 
a government statement said tran told eggar he could not waive 
khangs diplomatic immunity to enable britain to prosecute the 
third secretary on thursday the ambassador had agreed that khang 
would forgo his immunity 
on sept 4 the demonstrators that khang confronted took 
photographs of him holding a gun the pictures were published in 
londons daily express 
the foreign office said earlier this week that it took a very 
serious view of the incident and warned the ambassador of the 
gravest consequences unless the diplomats immunity was waived 
diplomatic missions in britain are not supposed to house arms 
the government has taken violations of that rule seriously since 
a gunman firing from the libyan embassy killed a london policewoman 
during a protest demonstration in april 1984 after a police siege 
of the embassy the building was closed and diplomatic relations 
severed

sgt john maggard and his wife kim 
have won a long bureaucratic battle to get their adopted son with 
aids into the united states now they face a sterner test keeping 
him alive 
jared maggard has three weeks three months three years we 
dont know says his mother his father says without a cure 
we know jared will die our goal is to give him as much time as 
possible 
the miracle the maggards hope for is a cure for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome which jared had when he was born to a young 
panamanian woman and an unknown father 
the aids virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers it is most 
often transmitted through sexual contact transfusions of tainted 
blood and the sharing of contaminated needles by drug abusers aids 
can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth 
when the maggards found jared abandoned in a hospital in colon 
panama they didnt know he had aids he was 11 months old weighed 
3 pounds and was being treated for malnutrition pictures show 
skeletal arms and legs ribs visible beneath thin stretched skin 
eyes sunken in an almost fleshless skull 
kim 25 had recently suffered a miscarriage and she and her 
husband a 26yearold army policeman then stationed at fort gulick 
on the pacific end of the panama canal fell in love with the child 
the couple from ypsilanti mich consulted army attorneys 
hired a panamanian lawyer and began adoption proceedings they were 
quickly granted custody the adoption became final last wednesday 
when the maggards took jared home from the hospital in december 
1986 he also was suffering from an ear infection his new mother 
pumped food into him sugar water infant formula laced with 
cereal canned baby food by the carton 
jared gained weight but despite repeated visits to army 
clinics the ear infection persisted finally 11 months later 
doctors puzzled by their inability to cure the infection with 
standard antibiotics ran a series of tests they showed jared had 
aids 
theres no doubt he had it from birth mrs maggard said in 
a recent interview and children born with aids dont usually 
live beyond the age of 2 the prognosis is between 2 and 6 years at 
the most and there have been only a few cases in which an infected 
child has reached the age of 6 
the aidspositive test results came back on sept 15 1987 a 
month before sgt maggard was to begin a new assignment in the 
united states us immigration and naturalization service 
officials the us consul general in panama and army lawyers told 
the couple they could not take jared home with them 
we were told it was against the law for anyone with aids to 
enter the united states and besides the adoption was not 
complete at the time says mrs maggard we were told we should 
give jared back and forget about it i wasnt about to do that 
sgt maggard extended his tour of duty in panama for another 
year rather than leave without his son but repeated entreaties by 
the young couple failed to sway a government and military 
bureaucracy 
on july 4 willard scott the nbc television weatherman came to 
panama to preside over an independence day celebration for us 
servicemen and women and their families by chance he met mrs 
maggard who told him of the couples plight nbc aired the story 
briefly on its nightly news program in early august 
the next day the telephone began ringing off the hook says 
mrs maggard from those calls the maggards say they learned for 
the first time of a provision in immigration rules that allow some 
aids victims into the united states on a parole basis 
we had never heard of that before says mrs maggard 
nobody down here had ever told us of that but the army was 
clearly embarrassed and it suddenly got behind us 100 percent 
sgt maggard says his commanding officer has told him that he 
can transfer to any one of four military posts in the united states 
where the army has aids treatment centers 
he says he will choose within the next week or so whether to go 
to the washington dc area to be near the walter reed medical 
center or to fort sam houston tex where the army hospital has a 
ward devoted to aids patients 
in the united states jared can be treated with azt and 
thats not available to army doctors overseas says mrs maggard 
azt is a new drug recently approved for aids treatment by the us 
food and drug administration it is not a cure but has been found 
to prolong the life of some victims by strengthening their immune 
systems 
as the maggards spoke jared now a chubby outwardly healthy 
appearing youngster of almost 3 years played underfoot jabbering 
in childish english and his native spanish part of a culture his 
parents say they are bent on preserving for him 
everybody remarks about how healthy he looks said mrs 
maggard but he has a lung infection that wont clear up and 
doctors say there are seven stages in the progression of aids 
given the diseases jared already has had they figure he is in the 
fifth or sixth stage

after a long and bitter debate the chamber 
of deputies today certified carlos salinas de gortari as president 
of mexico 
a spokesman for the chamber said the vote was 26385 
opposition lawmakers who claim salinas won the july 6 election 
through massive vote fraud tried to stall the certification 
process by making numerous speeches during an allnight session 
but they had no chance of prevailing 
salinas will begin a sixyear term dec 1 and replace miguel de 
la madrid 
the raucous debate occurred because the election placed the 
largest number of opposition lawmakers in the legislature since the 
governing institutional revolutionary party or pri was founded 
nearly 60 years ago 
as expected todays vote was along party lines pri won a 
majority of 260 in the 500person chamber in the election and at 
least three opposition deputies have since defected to the 
governing party 
orlando arvizu a pri deputy from hidalgo state said friday 
evening the chamber debate would continue until we certify the 
presidential election 
if its up to us it the confirmation could last three days 
we plan to destroy their arguments one by one said a popular 
socialist spokesman 
the popular socialist party belongs to the leftofcenter 
democratic front coalition headed by former presidential candidate 
cuauhtemoc cardenas 
on friday opposition delegates walked out on a key legislative 
committee but failed to prevent the panel from recommending 
salinas confirmation 
the pri members on the committee declared the july 6 election 
valid and said salinas won with 5074 percent the panel said 
cardenas won 3106 percent and manuel clouthier of the rightist 
national action party won 1681 percent 
the pri accused the opposition of trying to derail an orderly 
presidential transition what they are seeking is to destabilize 
the government and degrade the republic its institutions and its 
politics it said

a high percentage of high school biology 
teachers profess superstitious beliefs and about one in four think 
some races of people are inherently more intelligent than others 
according to a survey 
also about 19 percent of the teachers believe dinosaurs and 
humans lived at the same time according to the national survey by 
two university of texas at arlington researchers that will be 
released this week the dallas morning news reported in its 
saturday editions 
dr raymond eve associate professor of sociology at uta and 
dr dana dunn assistant professor of sociology mailed 
questionnaires to biology teachers to try to determine why many 
college students held pseudoscientific beliefs a finding of a 1987 
survey 
the two researchers sent a 12page 88item questionnaire to 
about 400 teachers selected at random from a list of 20000 
provided by the national science teachers association they 
received 200 responses the survey had a 5 percentage point margin 
of error 
eve said he hoped the results would spur further research 
the results when compared with an international study of 
highschool students biology knowledge show were doing 
something very very very wrong in biology education ms dunn 
said 
a study this year by the international association for the 
evaluation of educational achievement found us students scoring 
no higher than eighth among 13 countries in the sciences and last 
in biology 
the texas researchers found what eve called racial bigotry 
in responses to the survey statement some races of people are 
more intelligent than others 
twentysix percent of the respondents said the statement was 
definitely true or probably true while 24 percent circled 
inconclusive evidence 
based on the survey responses eve said theres a sort of 
racism that major cultural accomplishments such as the egyptian 
pyramids or incan religious structures couldnt have been built 
by stupid indians it had to be white europeans or space gods 
eve said 94 percent of those surveyed were white and 63 percent 
were male 
central to the study and most surprising to the researchers 
was that biology teachers seemed to misunderstand what science is 
all about eve said 
given the statement scientists seek facts but sometimes the 
best they can do is theories only 5 percent correctly answered 
definitely false 
a theory is not an educated guess as many lay people 
believe he said science is a systematic method of arriving at 
conclusions or theories using the facts as a basis he said 
eve and ms dunn cited poor teacher training as a major reason 
for the pseudoscientific and superstitious beliefs in texas for 
example teachers are allowed to instruct one class a day outside 
their areas of certification 
only about 25 percent of teachers surveyed have degrees in 
biology and too often the study found the science class was the 
teachers secondary area of instruction or the teacher had only 
science education as a major

president reagan described the educational 
record of his administration as a triumph of common sense 
answers saturday but senate democratic leader robert c byrd 
denounced the administrations educational policies as terribly 
wrong 
reagan taking note of the beginning of the academic year this 
week in many schools said from the oval office in his weekly radio 
address that the prospects for education are brighter than they 
have been for over two decades 
byrd responding for the democrats charged that nothing has 
been done by the white house to link americas economic future to 
rebuilding our nations educational system nothing at all 
reagan as he has in many of his recent radio addresses put in 
a plug for vice president george bush the republican presidential 
nominee 
the recovery of our schools has been a genuine grassroots 
accomplishment and it proves the solution to problems is not to 
throw money at them but to come up with common sense answers and 
start applying them the president said 
i am proud that during our administration george bush and i 
have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand 
byrd however said if the white house had its way pell 
grants for needy college and university students would be cut by 
40 percent college work study programs would end vocational 
education would stop altogether and aid to graduate school 
students would come to a halt even the drug free school program 
would be cut by 50 percent 
my friends this is terribly wrong the west virginia 
senator said 
the administration subtracts from education byrd said 
the congress adds to save it 
i dont understand why the administration hasnt done its 
homework he said 
reagan conceded that there are shortcomings in the schools 
we have just begun he said far too many students are 
graduating from schools without the skills they need to prosper and 
the knowledge they need to grow 
the education our children need is the ability to read write 
and reason as well as any student in any country in the world 
the president said 
byrd said the white house talks a lot about the three rs 
but when it comes to helping education their three rs amount to 
rhetoric reductions and retrenchment 
the president also said that the education of all americans 
must be rooted in the selfevident truths of western civilization 
a proposition that has been assailed on some college campuses 
since the founding of this nation education and democracy 
have gone hand in hand he said 
every american is the inheritor of our great cultural 
tradition he said thats why i have supported and continue to 
support all efforts to reach our children about our culture to 
read great texts and learn their lessons

a rancher who lost 500 cows after they were 
sprayed with a sincebanned pesticide has won a 7 million libel 
judgment stemming from a university report blaming all but one of 
the deaths on improper care 
the chancellor of the university of california at davis said 
friday that an appeal is planned of a jurys 7 million award to 
george neary of chico 
after a fourmonth trial an alameda county jury decided 
thursday in favor of neary for a ucdavis report quoting 
investigators as saying that the 1979 deaths of 500 of nearys 
cattle resulted from inadequate feeding and care 
the report concluded that only one death was due to the states 
spraying of toxaphene to fight a feared infestation of scabies 
mites 
against nearys wishes the pesticide was sprayed by department 
of food and agriculture veterinarians on a herd of cattle he had 
recently bought in oregon and transported to his ranch 10 miles 
north of chico 
in 1982 the federal environmental protection agency banned most 
uses of toxaphene the chemical has been linked to cancer in humans 
neary contended the ucdavis report libeled him by depicting him 
as an incompetent rancher and implying that his ranching practices 
led to his cattles deaths 
nearys lead attorney john keker said the three veterinarians 
named in the lawsuit lied in their report to protect the 
universitys close ties with state veterinarians as well as the 
chemical and beef industries 
it looked like science but actually it was science fiction 
he said davis chancellor theodore l hullar said officials there 
were stunned to learn of the jurys verdict 
the expert opinion requested of our veterinary professors was 
offered in good faith and after a rigorous and objective study 
he said their field investigations and laboratory analyses were 
thorough their conclusions soundly reasoned and their conduct 
above reproach 
hullar said the decision would be appealed and the university 
would not allow it to deter our involvement in other potentially 
controversial areas requiring impartial and expert analysis 
the veterinarians were richard mccapes assistant dean of the 
school of veterinary medicine and faculty members charles hjerpe 
and ben norman they have a libel suit pending against neary and 
cbs news for comments he made in a 60 minutes program 
after the verdict neary said the uc system has been covering 
up for these murders too long animals rivers women mexican 
farmworkers are all being poisoned its been going on too long and 
its got to be stopped 
neary sought 12 million in the lawsuit which was heard in 
superior court in oakland because the uc system headquarters are 
located in nearby berkeley 
neary also has a suit pending in us district court in fresno 
against state veterinarians who sprayed the toxaphene at his ranch

actress valerie harper and her husband stand 
to lose nearly 23 million in future profits as a result of her 
being dropped from the hit show originally titled valerie her 
attorney said 
closing arguments were completed friday in a contract dispute 
between lorimar productions and miss harper who was dropped from 
the television show along with her husband last year the judge 
planned to give instructions to the jury monday 
attorney barry langberg who represents miss harper and her 
husband tony cacciotti said the couple lost nearly 23 million in 
future profits when they were cut out of the show cacciotti was 
coexecutive producer of the show 
the figure was calculated by estimating the value of each 
episode of valerie an nbc situation comedy after miss harper 
left the show it was retitled the hogan family 
langberg argued that miss harper was a perfectionist who wanted 
to deliver the best show possible he also portrayed lorimars 
dismissal of the couple as unjustified and an act of bad faith 
donald engel an attorney for lorimar said miss harper made a 
deal to quit the show but became dissatisfied with it afterward 
attorneys contended that miss harper made demands for more money 
and staged months of bruising emotional battles on the set

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address saturday 
my fellow americans its september a time when our children 
once again return to school bright with promise and eager for 
instruction im happy to report that if the record of the past 
eight years is any indication the prospects for their education 
are bright brighter than theyve been for more than two decades 
test scores are up reversing a calamitous drop in scores over 
the years between 1963 and 1980 attendance is up and the number 
of kids who drop out of high school is down the recovery of our 
schools has been a genuine grassroots accomplishment and it proves 
the solution to problems is not to throw money at them but to come 
up with commonsense answers and start applying them 
im proud that during our administration george bush and i have 
been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand but weve 
only just begun far too many american students are graduating from 
school without the skills they will need to prosper and the 
knowledge theyll need to grow as adults and no one knows this 
better than americas parents who rose up at the beginning of the 
decade and said our children are not getting the education they 
want need and deserve 
the education our children want is the ability to discover the 
answers to the basic questions we all have who am i where do i 
live and what is the world around me like children yearn to learn 
and their capacity for it is one of the godgiven wonders the 
education our children need is the ability to read write and 
reason as well as any student in any country in the world they 
need it and the nation needs it as well if were to prosper and 
grow 
the education our children deserve is the kind no american 
should be deprived of for its the basic instruction in what it 
means to be an american i believe that the education of all 
americans must be rooted in the selfevident truths of western 
civilization these are the truths that have been passed down like 
precious heirlooms from generation to generation since the 
generations began 
since the founding of this nation education and democracy have 
gone hand in hand thomas jefferson not only wrote the declaration 
of independence and served as our third president but also founded 
one of our most distinguished institutions of higher learning the 
university of virginia jefferson and the founders believed a 
nation that governs itself like ours must rely upon an informed and 
engaged electorate their purpose was not only to teach all 
americans how to read and write but to instill the selfevident 
truths that are the anchors of our political system truths to 
quote jefferson such as all men are created equal that they 
are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights 
that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
this is our precious heritage and our political freedoms the 
freedom to speak to practice our religions to assemble 
peacefully are the product of ideas that were born and nurtured in 
the great tradition of western civilization that tradition does 
not say some men have these rights it says all men everywhere on 
this earth whether of asian hispanic or african dissent no 
matter what color every american is the inheritor of our great 
cultural tradition 
thats why ive supported and continue to support all efforts to 
teach our children about our culture to read great texts and learn 
their lessons bill bennett our secretary of education has just 
reported on the state of elementary education in our country that 
report entitled james madison elementary schools presents an 
outline for what every elementary school curriculum should include 
it is suffused with the glory of western civilization and i salute 
it 
we owe our children no less than to instruct them in what 
matthew arnold called the best that has been known and said 
and yet just as forcefully i want to say that this curriculum is 
only a guideline for school districts to follow if they think it 
right the final arbiter of what a child should learn is not the 
state but the family and the community in which the child lives 
and so i support the right of all parents to choose the education 
they believe is best for their children in the form of magnet 
schools and state programs like minnesotas which permits parents 
to choose which schools their children can attend 
in addition programs like youth 2000 which teaches kids to 
rely on themselves and to say no to drugs are vital in our efforts 
yes were blessed to be the recipients of this cultural bounty 
and we must be responsibile too as the constitution says secure 
the blessings to our posterity 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans radio address saturday given by sen robert c 
byrd dwva 
this week millions of american children went back to school 
these young people represent americas future 
today i want to take issue with what the president has been 
saying about education lets set the record straight 
for seven years now the congress and the administration have 
been working on our arithmetic the administration subtracts from 
education the congress adds to save it 
for seven years now we democrats have been trying to educate the 
administration about the value of education it hasnt helped 
im not surprised this white house has never had a real 
commitment to excellence in education i dont understand why the 
administration hasnt done its homework 
americas future economic prosperity depends on having the best 
educated workforce in the world put simply an educated america is 
a strong america 
just two days ago the council on competitiveness stated that 
america is developing an ominous dependence on foreign 
professors and researchers forty percent of all engineering 
students graduating from american colleges and universities are now 
foreignborn we now import brains and intellectual talent the same 
way that we import cars and radios 
why do we rely so heavily on foreign talent because our schools 
are not teaching our children the math and science skills they need 
for our new hightech economy and thats not all according to a 
recent survey 75 percent of all american students could not locate 
the persian gulf on a world map 
the alarm has been sounded again and again yet nothing has been 
done by the white house to link americas economic future to 
rebuilding our nations educational system nothing at all 
this white house talks a lot about the three rs but when it 
comes to helping education their three rs amount to rhetoric 
reductions and retrenchment 
if the white house had its way pell grants would be cut by 40 
percent college work study programs would end vocational 
education would stop altogether and aid to graduate school 
students would come to a halt even the drug free school 
program would be cut by 50 percent 
my friends this is terribly wrong 
it used to be that a highschool diploma was the guarantee of a 
good job and the chance to marry and settle down now even our 
high school graduates are struggling put simply you cant get 
ahead unless you have the best education possible 
but getting a good college education is almost out of reach for 
these young americans and for millions of other americans 
there are hundreds of thousands of middleclass families 
struggling to make ends meet so they can send their children to 
college they want their children to get ahead to be a part of an 
american dream 
but in the last seven years their sacrifice has gone unrewarded 
even though college tuitions have risen by 60 percent since 1981 
again and again the administration has tried to cut student aid i 
have had to vote 14 times in the last seven years to protect 
student loan programs fourteen times 
and when it comes to doing something about adult illiteracy 
the white house blackboard is completely blank twentythree 
million americans are now functionally illiterate how difficult it 
must be to live a life when you cannot read and write when you 
cannot read the bible or a story to your children or even the 
funny pages in the newspaper 
yet these illiterate americans are the very americans who can 
make the difference if america is to stay no 1 if we want 
america to be strong in every way we need to recognize that smart 
students are just as important as smart weapons in my home state 
of west virginia the students who answered my annual survey know 
that too forty percent of them rated education as the first 
priority of the federal government 
we need leadership in the white house that appreciates the value 
of education as much as do the young people of west virginia 
i am encouraged that at least one of the presidential candidates 
has made a pledge that no college student should be turned away 
from college because they cant get financial aid 
the education formula for americas future prosperity is clear 
good schools equal a smart workforce and that adds up to an america 
that is still the best 
lets do our homework now so we dont flunk later in this 
course america cant afford to fail 
thank you and may god bless you

loss in the hours spent in the cramped cockpit of the coneshaped 
plane 
the 21feet long plane has a onehalfhorsepower engine and a 
wingspan of 32 feet its top speed is about 60 mph 
flying at 10000 feet over the mediterranean i saw ships and 
tried to visualize how long it would take for them to pick me up if 
i fell in the bespectacled balding industrialist said at the 
airport 
i had a lifejacket strapped on shark repellent by my side and

newspaper owned by the singhania group singhania said the name was 
a combination of his two passions the spirit of adventure and 
his newspaper

ambassador for my country and show people india is not just a 
country of snake charmers he said

grandchildren now i have a fund of tales

following a political road map to battleground 
states republican george bush is zigzagging across america on a 
madefortelevision tour hinting at new policies to win support 
from women and conservative democrats 
he concentrated last week on pivotal states california texas 
illinois and pennylvania in his quest for the 270 electoral votes 
needed to capture the white house and made passes through 
washington oregon and kentucky 
after a weekend resting in washington bush returns to the 
campaign trail monday after announcing a national security advisory 
task force that will include former secretary of state henry a 
kissinger former un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick and brent 
scowcroft former white house national security adviser 
a surprise name on the list according to campaign sources will 
be zbigniew brzezinski who was president carters national 
security adviser 
from washington bush will head for some major industrial states 
on an itinerary that includes new jersey illinois missouri 
california and ohio before he returns home by friday 
i mean to win this election a newly energized bush 
repeatedly declared against highly telegenic backgrounds at each 
event campaign aides carefully checked camera angles to give 
photographers and television cameramen the best shots 
with public opinion surveys showing him edging ahead of democrat 
michael dukakis bush seemed more confident and at ease on the 
stump he rejected charges that he was waging a negative campaign 
his campaign message was tailored to fit the place and the 
audience 
wooing conservative democrats in east texas bush was a 
hardliner on abortion the death penalty gun control and prison 
furloughs he pounced on dukakis again for vetoing a bill aimed at 
requiring public school teachers to lead students in reciting the 
pledge of allegiance 
attacking dukakis as a cardcarrying member of the aclu and 
a progressive liberal democrat bush said its time to have 
a texan in the white house one who shares your values 
it was a different message that bush brought to rockford ill 
for an address friday before 200 members of the illinois federation 
of republican women 
observing that women earn an average 70 cents for every dollar 
earned by men bush said theres only one amount that a woman 
should earn for every dollar earned by a man and that is one 
dollar 
in an apparent departure from the reagan administrations policy 
of opposing parental job leaves bush declared we also need to 
assure that women dont have to worry about getting their jobs back 
after having a child or caring for a child during a serious 
illness he did not specify what he had in mind 
he reiterated in an interview that he opposes abortion except in 
cases of rape incest or when the mothers life is threatened 
significantly however he said his opposition to abortion is not 
a litmus test that everybody has to agree with most polls show a 
majority of americans are prochoice 
in another important electionyear shift aimed at winning 
bluecollar votes bush also signaled he is ready to endorse an 
increase in the minimum wage which has been frozen at 335 an 
hour for seven years 
the democrats already are moving an increase through congress a 
senate bill proposes an increase to 455 by 1991 while a house 
bill proposes 505 by 1992 
im talking to some of our experts and im going to do whats 
fair bush said he said he would insist on some minimumwage 
differential perhaps a training wage or a subminimum wage for 
teenagers 
trying to duplicate president reagans success at gaining 
coverage on the tv evening news shows bush went to great lengths 
to appear in colorful settings for the cameras 
he stained his tie filleting a white sea bass at a wholesale 
fish company in san diego paraded with mickey mouse at disneyland 
calif confronted a jeering union crowd at a portland ore 
shipyard watched the fiery destruction of nuclearmissile engines 
in texas and appeared at the marigold festival at pekin ill 
to keep the focus on themes of his choosing bush did not hold 
any news conferences with the campaign press corps last week he 
ignored a reporter who used a traffic cone as a megaphone to shout 
questions 
not everything went bushs way though 
in louisville ky bush flubbed by telling an american legion 
convention that sept 7 instead of dec 7 was the anniversary 
of the japanese attack on pearl harbor 
another embarrassment was the disclosure that jerome brentar 
cochairman of the bush 88 coalition of american nationalities 
was a defender of former ohio autoworker john demjanjuk who was 
convicted in israel as a nazi war criminal brentar resigned under 
fire

the gun when he confronted demonstrating vietnamese refugees in 
front of the embassy the foreign office said 
tran told the foreign office that his government regretted the 
incident and recognized that it constituted a breach of british and 
vietnamese regulations 
but tran said that in keeping with vietnams invariable 
practice the embassy would not grant a waiver of khangs 
diplomatic immunity to enable britain to prosecute him 
on thursday the vietnamese ambassador initially agreed that 
khang would give up his immunity 
the foreign office said britain would not accept nomination of a 
successor to khang until it received a full account of the 
disciplinary proceedings khang would face 
at the sept 4 embassy incident demonstrators took photographs

the incident and warned the ambassador of the gravest 
consequences unless the diplomats immunity was waived

faced with 1 millionaday fines and 
layoffs of hundreds of municipal workers the city council approved 
a courtordered housing desegregation plan saturday after two 
members switched their votes 
as an emotional crowd looked on the council approved the plan 
by a 52 vote about 130 am after a month in which escalating 
fines for refusing to endorse the plan threatened the states 
fourthlargest city with bankruptcy 
secretary of state gail shaffer head of the state board that 
took control of the citys finances suspended the layoffs of 447 
city employees after the vote 
this morning the healing process begins she said a new 
chapter in the history of yonkers can and must begin 
gov mario cuomo said the council did the right thing 
two of the four councilmen who had long opposed the plan voted 
for it after city officials negotiated a modified plan with the 
naacp that would mix some of the lowincome units ordered by the 
court with more expensive ones 
city officials planned to ask us district judge leonard sand 
to adopt the modified plan in place of his original order which he 
had enforced with fines that hit 1 million a day friday 
the vote came as opposition to sands plan was starting to wane 
uncollected garbage sits outside many homes children went to 
school without crossing guards and the three town libraries were 
scheduled to close 
in the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the 
abstract the abstract has now become a reality said 
councilman nicholas longo one of those who changed his vote the 
thing that most affected me was looking over a list of people who 
at the stroke of midnight would become unemployed 
longo and peter chema the other councilman who switched 
prefaced their vote with long speeches in which they noted that 
sand had said he would not agree to any changes in the plan unless 
the council first approved it unchanged 
one woman yelled you little snake at chema while another 
man screeched at mayor nicholas wasicsko you sold us out nicky 
well remember the mayor also voted for the plan 
after the vote about 100 spectators noisily filed out of the 
council chamber some cheering some cursing 
i think they sold our constitutional rights out yelled 
walter roland another resident michael duffy said its 
wonderful for the city of yonkers to be in compliance and following 
the law 
the fines had started at 100 and doubled each day reaching a 
cumulative total of more than 16 million paid through thursday 
the desegregation lawsuit was brought by the justice department 
in 1980 and joined by the national association for the advancement 
of colored people three years ago sand ordered an end to 
segregated housing and schools in yonkers 
on aug 2 he found the city of 194000 in contempt for the 
councils refusal to carry out a housing desegregation order 
the housing plan calls for 200 units of lowincome public 
housing scattered through mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units 
of middleincome subsidized housing 
councilmen henry spallone and edward fagan jr continued to 
oppose the plan and voted against it 
sand had threatened all four defiant council members with fines 
and jail terms for contempt but the us supreme court stayed the 
action earlier this month 
jack otoole president of the antiplan save yonkers 
federation said saturday his group had hired a lawyer and would 
continue to fight the plan

jack matsons first class assignment 
will be to have his university of michigan business school students 
laugh as ridiculously as they can later they will confront 
humiliation 
then when things go wrong in later life matson said theyll 
understand those are natural normal sensations and by knowing 
that theyll be more confident to forge ahead 
matson a university of houston engineering professor is on 
loan to the business school for the 198889 academic year 
his failure 101 course was selected from among 158 
competitors for the zelllaurie fellowship visiting professorship 
intended to develop courses to foster entrepreneurship 
it is based on a series of hurdlejumping exercises that 
confront students with repeated failures 
matson 46 said the idea sprang from unusual events in his own 
life at 40 he was hit in the head by a bolt of lightning while 
playing tennis and that freed him from a straitjacketed 
academic life he said 
there was nothing wrong with me physically but 
psychologically i still felt dead he said he decided he was 
having a midlife crisis and began exploring his creativity 
i started to feel that success is somewhat predicated on a 
nest of failures thats how we learn if we really want to 
succeed we have to take risks he said 
in his first class on monday matson plans to conduct a contest 
to see which student can produce the most ridiculous laugh he 
wants to create a spontaneous playful atmosphere 
i want to teach them how to generate ideas and bring out 
these things that are inside of them but have been suppressed 
during their entire academic careers because of fear of failure

what john mullan and thomas lopes found 
beside the road was literally a windfall but they didnt hesitate 
to get it back to its proper owner 
the two state public works department employees found 6100 in 
cash in a blue nylon briefcase alongside a road here wednesday and 
promptly turned it over to police 
harry w turner of east falmouth was carrying the money to buy a 
boat when the bag blew out the window of his vehicle said state 
trooper james mattaliano 
he didnt notice i guess mattaliano said he was very 
happy to get it back 
mullan and lopes said they didnt have to think about what to do 
with the money after they stopped and picked up the briefcase 
after realizing it contained 61 hundreddollar bills we 
looked at each other and started laughing then turned the truck 
around and took the bag to state police mullan said thursday 
it was hilarious he said you read about it in the paper 
and never think its going to happen to you 
lopes who at 62 is set to end a 28year career with the 
department in december said he and his partner wanted to feel 
good about doing the right thing 
we worried about the people who had lost it figuring they 
would get excited mullan said it wasnt our nature to keep 
it

moneylosing eastern airlines eliminated 4000 more 
jobs saturday in the downsizing it says it needs to survive 
but the unions charged that the cutbacks are actually making the 
airline less competitive 
the cuts which are being contested in court by the unions 
reduced easterns workforce to fewer than 30000 less than four 
years ago it had 42000 workers 
eastern eliminated 12 percent of its routes two weeks ago 
ending service to 14 cities 
laidoff workers with seniority can transfer to other cities 
bumping newer employees out of their jobs thus newer 
employees could take the brunt of the layoffs when the bumping is 
complete 
the mood around work gates was sullen 
weve had very few who have already gotten their layoff 
notices but weve heard there are about 80 who have shown 
intentions of bumping said don boyd a union chief steward 
representing ramp agents so a lot of these people dont know 
what to expect 
the people are devastated said charles e bryan president 
of the machinists local easterns largest union with nearly 12000 
members its a traumatic thing to lose your job when youve just 
gotten your children started in school 
of the 4000 jobs eliminated 1500 were nonunion positions 
including management and clerical 
among the 4000 are few hundred flight attendants mechanics 
baggage handlers and ramp agents who are taking early retirement or 
quitting eastern said 
the fact is we have lost over a billion dollars in this 
decade said robin matell the companys chief spokesman we 
have to take prudent although admittedly painful measures 
eastern which lost 182 million in 1987 and 149 million in the 
first half of 1988 and is 25 billion in debt estimates it will 
save 100 million a year with the latest cuts 
eastern was taken over more than two years ago by houstonbased 
texas air corp 
union members have accused texas air chairman frank lorenzo of 
stripping easterns assets in favor of texas airs sister airline 
continental which has been nonunion since lorenzo took it into 
bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 
the unions say downsizing the carrier dooms eastern to 
decreasing ability to compete laying off employees drives up labor 
costs per flight because lesssenior workers being laid off are 
paid less than those who remain they said 
the last thing you want to do in the airline industry is 
downsize bryan said many of the costs are fixed and the 
breakeven yield goes way up its a loselose proposition that 
just feeds on itself 
frank lorenzo is using typical robber baron strategy to 
plunder the company and try to make all the cash he can 
easterns unions will argue against the layoffs later this month 
in the us court of appeals in washington which allowed eastern 
to cut the jobs if it posted a 47 million bond to cover wages if 
workers are later reinstated 
the appeals court earlier his month set aside an injunction by 
us district judge barrington parker who had barred eastern from 
eliminating the jobs without negotiating with its unions 
machinists members will vote thursday on a management demand 
for 161 million in cuts the union and eastern have been in 
federal mediation since january

hays kirby refused to be run off by 
the sheriff when his town was ordered evacuated but he realizes 
that nearby forest fires might succeed where the law failed 
the owner of the 20room grizzly lodge just to the east of 
yellowstone national parks northeast entrance has watched forest 
fires burn to the north south and east of this mountain hamlet 
saturday he waited for flames from the storm creek fire some three 
miles to the west to be fanned into silver gate 
were going to burn up they cant stop this fire kirby 
45 said saturday while finicky breeze whipped the american flag 
outside his front door if the wind blows were going to blow 
up 
forecasts of wind blowing up to 60 mph had been dropped 
although meteorologists still said gusts to 40 mph were possible 
but a steady rain fell at midday 
forest fires have charred more than 1 million acres 300000 
acres on friday alone in yellowstone national park and its 
surrounding national forests since late june 
to kirby a wiry man who flies f16 fighters in the air force 
reserve and who has made this tiny community home for eight years 
the fires are an unnecessary tragedy 
this fire laid up in a place we call lake abundance for days 
and days and you could have driven you could have driven fire 
trucks in there and put this fire out he said 
but lake abundance is in the absarokabeartooth wilderness area 
in custer national forest just north of silver gate machinery is 
not allowed in wilderness areas and natural fires are allowed to 
burn without mans interference 
since it left the wilderness area firefighters have been unable 
to halt the fire 
a backfire started last week to eliminate fuel between silver 
gate and the storm creek fire reversed directions and burned east 
along the ridge running east and west above silver gate and cooke 
city several homes and outbuildings were destroyed by the flames 
there was no necessity for burning these communities up 
kirby said again 
since midaugust these two sleepy towns that funnel summertime 
tourists in and out of yellowstone and winter sportsmen into the 
surrounding mountains have acted mainly as fire camps 
about 100 people call silver gate and cooke city home throughout 
the year but the fires have brought 450 to 500 men and women in to 
fight the fires the storm creek fire camp just to the east of 
cooke city holds an additional 1100 
i live here my life is here my family is here said kirby 
who believes he and his immediate family are the only fulltime 
silver gate residents who have held their ground i just couldnt 
leave i just i dont know i really thought that we could get 
a handle on this fire 
while some other residents had come back he said they were 
ordered to leave quickly 
they the authorities came in and were going to remove them 
from their homes at gunpoint oh yes absolutely at gunpoint if 
necessary kirby said montana law to my knowledge does not 
allow for that i know theyve looked for me quite a lot i just 
havent been available 
in nearby cooke city phyllis and bernie kiley have been able to 
stay to run their store the yellowstone trading post 
the kileys could lose everything theyve worked for the past 17 
years if the storm creek fire hits them their investment in the 
trading post is about 250000 and their adjoining home is worth 
about 100000 their fire insurance wont come close to covering 
the losses they say 
i guess were naive mrs kiley said the park 
yellowstone wouldnt let us burn because they put us in this 
situation besides we couldnt pack it all up and take it

embarrassed after discovering his radio campaign advertisements 
were made by a fugitive being sought by his department on an 
outstanding warrant 
according to court records mark moody an exdisc jockey and 
resort operator was being sought on felony theft and misdemeanor 
obstruction of justice charges when he recorded several radio ads 
for thompson this week 
i thought it was all settled the juneau county sheriff said 
friday i thought he had worked things out with the district 
attorney and the court 
thompson said saturday that authorities had been informed moody 
had moved to nevada and thus should not be considered a fugitive 
the district attorneys office knew where mark was mark was 
not a fugitive thompson said he left juneau county apparently 
some time before any paperwork was issued 
but a bench warrant was issued for moody on aug 16 after he 
failed a second time to appear on the charges in a 4yearold theft 
case 
according to the criminal complaint signed by thompson moody 
confessed in june to taking a safe from the port o call resort 
that he and his father jerry moody operated on castle rock lake 
in 1984 
the younger moody had initially reported that the safe and its 
contents valued at more than 3000 had been taken during a 
burglary 
thompson who faces a reelection challenge in tuesdays 
primary said he did not pay moody for the radio spots which aired 
for the first time friday 
juneau county district attorney jonathan lindberg said moody has

an apple a day may keep the doctor 
away but communities hoping to lure physicians to their small 
towns passed out the tempting fruit at the 10th annual doctors fair 
at the southern illinois university school of medicine 
i guess were feeling like an apple a day keeps the doctor at 
home or something said john record an assistant dean at the 
medical school who organized the fair 
the medical students and residents who trekked through the tent 
adjacent to the school last week could get information about jobs 
and incentive packages offered by towns like sandwich ill 
hospitals in larger communities like peoria and even the us army 
dr ron johnson a former siu med school student who was lured 
to the westcentral illinois community of pittsfield partly because 
of the doctors fair said he returned to the fair this year to get 
assistance 
im dying for help said johnson a family practitioner he 
said he is the only doctor who delivers babies in pike county 
population 19000 and works as many as 110 hours a week 
on the third day that you go to the hospital before your kids 
get up and get home after theyre in bed it gets real hard to go 
to work he said 
they werent just handing out apples at the fair medical 
students residents or physicians hoping to change jobs could pick 
up an armful of brochures as well as such trinkets at coffee mugs 
visors candy cookies note pads key chains or even roses to pin 
on a lapel 
we give one to all the students and hope that they think were 
a classact hospital said ray marmorstone administrator at st 
francis hospital in litchfield population 7200 
representatives from sandwich community hospital offered fake 
100 bills beneath a sign that said come to where the money is 
sandwich illinois 
the hospital was offering doctors an incentive package that 
includes a guaranteed 100000 salary for the first year as well as 
free office space paid malpractice insurance and loans for office 
equipment 
i talked to one individual who just said how he would pay off 
my student loans theyd give me two years free rent in some 
office building said fourthyear siu medical student mark 
zenker 25 
when youre about 40000 in debt you kind of think of a few 
things like that he said 
dr leslie page a resident at siu said there was a lot of 
interest in her specialty obstetrics and gynecology apparently 
because so many physicians are leaving that field because of 
spiraling malpractice insurance costs 
i just had a man who said i was golden anytime anywhere 
she said 
tom wallhaus a thirdyear medical student said he had no 
qualms about starting his career in a small town 
its kind of tempting to think that youre going to be the guy 
in charge of the medicine in some town he said thats 
tempting

pope john paul ii on saturday accused 
south africa and other forces of destablizing the region 
criticized apartheid and called for the release of black 
nationalist nelson mandela 
the roman catholic leader at the start of a 10day tour of 
southern africa also urged the people of the region to renounce 
violence 
powerful political economic and ideological forces endanger 
the still fragile stability of countries which are only beginning 
to consolidate their recently acquired independence the pope 
said in an arrival speech those forces impede the 
selfdetermination of peoples they foment ideological ethnic and 
tribal conflicts they delay the process of development 
the pope did not mention any country by name but he said his 
comments were true for the grave issue of apartheid south 
africas policy of racial segregation he told journalists 
accompanying him on the papal flight from rome that apartheid was 
a racist ideology 
hundreds of zimbabweans cheered wildly as the pope appeared at 
the door of his air alitalia boeing 747 descended a stairway and 
kneeled to kiss the soil in his traditional arrival gesture 
later thousands of waving and cheering people stood along the 
popes motorcade route from harare international airport to 
downtown 
at the airport president robert mugabe one of the nearly 1 
million catholics in this country of 85 million people waited at 
the edge of a red carpet to greet the pope 
traditional dancers and church choirs gave john paul a festive 
welcome to start his 39th tour abroad and fourth visit to africa 
since he became head of the roman catholic church 10 years ago 
the popes threeday trip to zimbabwe is the first stop on the 
his fivenation tour of southern africa his first visit to the 
politically troubled region the other countries he will visit are 
botswana lesotho swaziland and mozambique 
the five countries are among the youngest in africa and 
8yearold zimbabwe is the youngest the southern states oppose 
whiteled south africas racial segregation policy but must depend 
on the economically and militarily powerful neighbor for economic 
survival 
the pretoria government asked john paul to include south africa 
on his current tour but the invitation was rejected 
even though he is avoiding south africa the tour is expected to 
be one of the most politically charged trips by john paul the most 
widelytraveled pope in history 
speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him to zimbabwe 
the former whiteruled british colony of rhodesia the 68yearold 
pontiff expressed hope that a future papal trip to south africa 
would trigger changes but he said no date had been set for such a 
trip 
he also stopped short of endorsing an american sanctions bill 
that mandates disinvestment by us companies from south africa and 
a neartotal trade embargo 
after his zimbabwe speech john paul told bishops from the 
region gathered at a dominican convent that he prayed every day 
for the release of mandela 
mandela the 70yearold leader of the african national 
congress has refused to sign a statement renouncing use of 
violence as a condition for his release from south african 
detention 
i ask for his freedom every day it must take place i 
am full of admiration for him i am proud of his firmness he 
said 
the anc is the major guerrilla group fighting the south african 
government 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
the pope also told the bishops that only a negotiated 
settlement of differences can bring true peace and justice in 
south africa 
a loss of confidence in the possibility of a peaceful solution 
could easily lead to further frustration and violence increasing 
the threat to peace not limited to this region he said 
he endorsed the usmediated regional peace talks between 
angola cuba and south africa that seek the departure of 50000 
cubans from angola and have led to the withdrawal of south african 
troops involved in the 13yearlong civil war 
the talks also seek to bring independence to southwest africa 
known as namibia

with a few phrases under a hot east texas sun 
michael dukakis displayed the combative aggressive stance that 
worried supporters have been beseeching him to display in his 
lagging campaign against republican george bush 
at the end of a week filled with calamities and plummeting 
polls the democratic presidential nominee took on bush in his 
strongest language yet 
dukakis compared bushs attacks suggesting that he was short on 
patriotism and soft on crime to mccarthyism of the 1950s and said 
the american people could smell the garbage 
he finally went ahead and said what we all feel said ann 
richards the bluntspoken texas state treasurer and democratic 
convention keynoter you can be statesmanlike only so long when 
a schoolyard bully is pushing everybody around 
campaign aides want dukakis to keep up his tough talk about bush 
this week while he attempts to follow another piece of their advice 
to add more specifics to his rhetoric 
dukakis plans to outline in greater detail his views on defense 
and national security during appearances this week including one 
in annapolis md where he had sought but failed to win the vice 
presidents agreement for a foreign policy debate 
the massachusetts governor kept up the attack saturday 
questioning the vice presidents judgment in having three senior 
advisers who are partners in a washington lobbying firm that once 
represented the bahamas government for an 800000 fee in a 
dukakis white house there will be no back doors for foreign 
lobbyists he said 
dukakis got an enthusiastic reception at a rally in commerce 
texas on friday with his tough new response to bush campaign 
aides saw the speech as an important move toward lifting dukakis 
out of his perceived slump 
dukakis himself was visibly changed after the speech shedding 
his reserved demeanor and draping his arm around a reporter 
his campaign managers discomfort over dukakis slide in the 
polls since the democratic convention in midjuly has been worsened 
by a frustrating campaign kickoff week in which events were 
disrupted or canceled partly because of problems with chartered 
planes 
democrats voiced alarm at seeing dukakis drop from a lead of 17 
percentage points in postconvention polls to an eightpoint 
deficit after labor day 
rep barney frank dmass told the new york times the dukakis 
campaign had only two weeks to turn things around 
democratic sen tom harkin of iowa said an overly cautious 
strategy of ignoring attacks by bush caused the decline 
a president has to be an aggressive person harkin said 
its not the kind of world where you want a caspar milquetoast in 
the white house 
mrs richards privately urged dukakis to move swiftly to try to 
regain the offensive 
i talked to him a lot and i told him you dont have to take 
that kind of garbage she said i think he had to respond 
bush has dominated the presidential campaign since his 
nomination in midaugust by carefully selecting and timing his 
easily understood attacks on dukakis record 
the vice president seemed to be casting doubt on dukakis 
patriotism while denying he was doing so by making an issue of 
the massachusetts governors veto of a bill aimed at requiring 
public school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the pledge 
of allegiance dukakis said he was advised that the bill was 
unconsititutional 
dukakis press secretary dayton duncan said the governor had 
written much of the texas speech himself campaign chairman paul 
brountas said dukakis was angered by a pair of news stories during 
the week 
in one members of a bush booster organization were disclosed to 
have voiced antisemitic views in the other a lobbying firm 
associated with bushs campaign manager had received 800000 for 
lobbying on behalf of a foreign official involved in a drug 
investigation 
he read that and said these people are questioning my 
patriotism brountas said 
he was outraged duncan said 
the new conviction behind dukakis assault on bush coincided 
with the return of his former campaign manager john sasso who has 
a close relationship with the candidate and was warmly welcomed by 
other campaign staffers 
dukakis formal campaign kickoff began on a dismal note 
when he appeared in a philadelphia neighborhood early labor day 
morning antiabortion protesters clogged one end of the street and 
their chants reverberated down the block a faulty sound system 
left dukakis words unintelligible campaign sources said an 
advance man was fired 
a day later in chicago dukakis speech was disrupted by 
antiabortion hecklers who determinedly tried to shout him down 
things got worse dukakis campaign jet plane was effectively 
grounded by a federal aviation administration spot inspection which 
began 15 minutes before the scheduled takeoff the rest of the day 
was lost press briefings were set up on the run and contradictory 
answers were given to reporters 
arriving in baltimore for a welcome by maryland gov william 
donald schaefer the democratic nominee found there was no ramp at 
the front of the plane 
nonetheless brountas told reporters friday morning that the 
week was tops for dukakis later in the day he repeated his 
declaration and added now i can say that with more conviction

fancied by herbert hoover sold by jimmy carter 
and ignored by ronald reagan the presidential yacht sequoia is on 
the last leg of a 120city fundraising tour before it is returned 
to white house control 
the sequoia was bought by the commerce department from a 
philadelphia family in 1929 after hoover wintered on the boat in 
florida in 1933 it was acquired by the navy and declared the 
official presidential yacht 
the 105foot vessel served eight presidents over a period of 44 
years before carter ordered the ship sold at auction in 1977 as an 
austerity move 
the sequoia is really a symbol of the presidency in the 20th 
century said j michael mcgehee spokesman for the presidential 
yacht trust the private group that bought the ship and began 
restoring it in 1981 
franklin d roosevelt planned war strategy from the ship harry 
truman used it for the first international conference on nuclear 
arms control and richard nixon held working sessions with the likes 
of soviet leader leonid brezhnev on board mcgehee said 
the ship was open for public visits over the weekend at the 
charlestown navy yard in boston it will make more stops along the 
atlantic coast before it is donated to the navy on nov 15 and 
again becomes the presidential yacht 
the fundraising voyage has raised 55 million half the 11 
million needed for restoration costs and to create an endowment for 
future maintenance and operations without taxpayer expense he said 
but mcgehee said reagan has failed to stamp his imprimatur on 
the project 
this is the ultimate private sector project he said one 
would think ronald reagan would be willing to hold this up and say 
this is what ive been talking about 
lyndon johnson used the lure of an afternoon cruise on the ship 
to entangle legislators in marathon discussions and hold them 
hostage until they came around to his point of view mcgehee said 
weve had some funny stories about senators and congressmen 
telling the captain to turn the boat around and go back to dock 
the captain would say he could only listen to his 
commanderinchief 
nixon enjoyed taking cruises on the potomac in the sequoia and 
announced his decision to resign the presidency to his family 
aboard the ship 
a joint congressional resolution in 1985 provided for the 
sequoias eventual return and the ship was designated a national 
historic landmark earlier this year 
mcgehee said the presidential yacht trust has spent 35 million 
restoring teak paneling bleached ash interiors handmade carpets 
engines and other details the ship was built for 210000 but to 
build it now would cost between 8 million and 10 million

experts have concluded that an italian 
jetliner which mysteriously crashed into a sea eight years ago 
killing all 81 people on board was shot down by missile a 
newspaper reported 
british and american experts have been analyzing the recently 
salvaged wreckage of the dc9 which exploded and crashed into the 
tyrrhenian sea on june 27 1980 
the italian government financed a salvage operation to raise the 
fuselage so experts could determine the cause of the disaster 
the milan newspaper corriere della sera said that british 
explosives experts and american engineers at mcdonnell douglas 
corp the jetliners manufacturer have determined the plane was 
downed by a missile 
the paper said the missile exploded seconds before it would have 
struck the jetliner it said the blast destroyed the cockpit 
killed the flight crew damaged the baggage compartment door on the 
right scorched the outside of the plane and punched three 
grapefruitsize holes in the fuselage 
the same newspaper reported in june that experts were certain 
the airliner had been hit by a missile but a member of the 
investigating commission later denied it had reached any 
conclusions 
corriere della sera said on friday that the experts completed 
their investigation thursday and that the results were being 
forwarded to judge vittorio bucarelli who is in charged of the 
inquiry 
the newspaper said the voice recorder on the flight picked up an 
undecipherable shout just before the explosion 
it also said the british experts are still trying to determine 
the chemical composition of the explosive as a way to trace the 
nationality of the missile 
the plane was on a flight from bologna to palermo sicily it 
crashed in the sea 30 miles southwest of naples between the 
islands of ponza and ustica

the nations largest labor 
federation on saturday rejected a government appeal to call off 
another general strike and said the work stoppage will be held to 
protest police repression 
the general labor confederation said its unions will hold a 
24hour nationwide strike on monday 
it had organized an 8hour general strike friday to protest the 
gpvernments economic policies and police used tear gas rubber 
bullets and clubs to disperse about 20000 demonstrators at a rally 
in downtown buenos aires 
the monday strike is unchangeable and there will be no 
modification saul ubaldini secretarygeneral of the labor 
federation told reporters as he arrived at a union meeting to 
discuss fridays violence 
he said mondays strike would be a peaceful repudiation of 
police actions friday 
federal police said saturday that 76 demonstrators and 37 
policemen were injured during the disturbances in the plaza de 
mayo they reported four civilians and eight policemen were 
hospitalized for fractures and cuts 
thirteen demonstrators were arrested and face charges of 
assault resisting arrest arson and vandalism according to the 
report 
the interior ministry had appealed to the labor federation to 
reconsider its call for a monday strike it said police intervened 
in the buenos aires rally to halt vandalism and fighting between 
rival union groups 
but ubdaldini said its a lie that the incidents began among 
participants of the rally 
interior minister enrique nosiglia issued a communique saying 
violence can only benefit small antidemocratic sectors 
nothing can justify a new paralyzation of the country that 
will only postpone progress without providing any benefit for 
rights and freedoms it said 
mondays strike will be the 13th organized by the general labor 
confederation since the elected government of president raul 
alfonsin and his centrist radical civic union came to power dec 
10 1983 ending nearly eight years of military rule the labor 
federation is dominated by the opposition peronist party 
both nosiglia and federal police chief juan pirker rejected 
union charges of police brutality and blamed agitators for the 
violence 
ubaldini who fled the platform at the plaza de maya rally 
friday in a cloud of tear gas had described the strike as a 
peoples referendum against the plan of hunger and misery that they 
the government want to impose on us 
he referred to an antiinflation plan introduced by the 
government last month that devalued the currency lifted 
restrictions on some imports and called for voluntary wage and 
price controls 
inflation has registered 255 percent so far this this year and 
440 percent during the past 12 months

the discovery of mercury in freshwater 
marshes in eastern new orleans has complicated plans to turn the 
area into the bayou sauvage national wildlife refuge 
the us fish and wildlife service told city and state officials 
thursday that they discovered quantities of mercury well above 
federal health levels near a landfill that has a history of leaking 
into the surrounding marshes 
the cityowned recovery i landfill is operated by waste 
management inc and a company spokesman denied the landfill was 
the source of the mercury contamination 
the fish and wildlife report said it found only mercury not 
pesticides or petroleum hydrocarbons the report said additional 
samples have been taken to confirm the mercury findings and those 
results should be available in october 
officials said the mercury contamination poses no immediate 
health hazard the marshland near the landfill is not used for 
commercial fishing or hunting and since mercury is a heavy metal 
it tends to sink and combine with sediment at the bottom of the 
marsh 
wildlife service officials already were concerned that about 
1500 acres of marshland near the landfill was depleted of oxygen 
a symptom of chemical and biological contaminants and was not 
supporting wildlife 
city officials had been negotiating with federal officials to 
see if an airport could be constructed near the proposed refuge 
the questions raised by the wildlife service test results will slow 
down those negotiations city officials said 
city officials said they arent convinced the landfill is the 
source of the contamination and suggested the mercury might be 
from a spill from railroad tank cars on tracks that cut across the 
property no such spill has been reported 
planning commission director bob becker said city consultants 
also dont understand why the test results turned up no other 
contaminants when a mixture of contaminants would be more likely 
to escape from a landfill 
state department of environmental quality officials said they 
will review the recovery i operating permit which expires oct 17 
city officials have notified the state that they dont plan to 
renew waste managements contract to operate the facility although 
waste management requested a 10year extension of its state permit 
last year 
the city wants to put operation of the landfill out to bid and 
has asked the state for a sevenyear grace period to continue to 
dispose household garbage in the landfill before shutting it down

michael dukakis lashed out anew at george bushs 
judgment and leadership saturday accusing the vice president of 
associating with aides who helped the bahamian government when it 
was under drug investigation and others reported to be sympathetic 
to nazis 
my staff will not have divided loyalties the democratic 
presidential nominee said in a dukakis white house the staff 
will pledge allegiance to only one flag old glory 
dukakis spending the weekend off the campaign trail gave 
reporters copies of a memorandum from a washington lobbying firm 
with which several top bush advisers are associated 
in the memo the firm of black manafort amp stone promised to 
improve the image of the government of the bahamas among reagan 
administration officials and congress 
the bahamian government accepted the proposal and paid the 
republican lobbying firm 800000 between april 1985 and september 
1986 the bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling long has 
been suspected of involvement with drug traffickers 
the lobbying firms memo boasted of the companys influence 
within the administration and listed more than a dozen contacts 
with bushs office 
three bush aides and advisers are partners in the firm they are 
charles r black paul j manafort and roger j stone all have 
strong ties to the reagan white house in addition to their campaign 
roles bush campaign manager lee atwater also is listed on the 
memo but bush campaign spokesman mark goodin said atwater had no 
role in the contract 
the measure of a president is the quality and the integrity of 
the people with whom he surrounds himself dukakis told a 
statehouse news conference 
the american people have the right to know that the back door 
of the white house will not be the front door for paid agents of 
foreign governments in a dukakis white house there will be no back 
doors for foreign lobbyists 
the massachusetts governor said bushs association with the 
black manafort amp stone partners and with campaign aides who have 
defended nazis and nazi organizations raises serious questions 
about mr bushs judgment and the kind of people he attracts 
jerome brentar cochairman of the bush 88 coalition of 
american nationalities was a defender of former ohio autoworker 
john demjanjuk who was convicted in israel as a nazi war criminal 
brentar resigned under fire 
but florian galdau and philip guarino respectively honorary 
chairman and vice chairman of the panel stay on despite 
revelations of their ties to fascist pronazi and antisemitic 
organizations said rep charles schumer dny on saturday 
calling for the two to resign 
the philadephia inquirer reported saturday that several other 
bush campaign officials have supported nazis 
i think it says a great deal about that campaign dukakis 
said it says a great deal about the judgment of mr bush 
dukakis used the pledge allegiance to only one flag line to 
counter bushs attacks on dukakis for his 1977 veto of a bill aimed 
at requiring state public school teachers to lead pupils in 
reciting the pledge of allegiance dukakis had been advised the 
bill was unconstitutional 
the house rejected a republican proposal friday that each days 
session in that chamber begin not only with a prayer but with the 
pledge of allegiance but speaker jim wright said the pledge would 
be recited on two mornings next week 
dukakis said he had no objection if congress decided to start 
each legislative day with the pledge he then quickly cited bushs 
official duty as president of the senate and said 
to the best of my knowledge hes never once suggested that the 
pledge be part of the regular routine of the senate so whos 
kidding whom 
on friday dukakis likened the republican attacks on him to 
mccarthyism of the 1950s he stopped short of directly accusing 
bush of such tactics saturday but criticized him for not 
condemning several unsubstantiated attacks on dukakis his wife and 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
remaining silent in my judgment is not the way you take 
responsibility and provide leadership the governor said 
dukakis planned to meet saturday night and sunday with several 
democratic members of congress who are experts in national security 
and defense matters including sens sam nunn of georgia and john 
glenn of ohio and rep les aspin of wisconsin 
those sessions were to help prepare dukakis to outline his 
positions in detail next week on those issues republicans have 
labeled dukakis weak and naive in those areas 
i happen to think mr bush is very vulnerable on foreign 
policy and national security issues dukakis said saturday 
its a question of judgment questions of support for 
irancontra latinamerican policy which is failed and illegal 
statements made failure of execution a whole series of task 
forces which the vice president has been in charge of which have 
been absolute failures he said 
i think its time now that the american people take a good 
hard look at his record

henry a kissinger former un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick 
former national security adviser brent scowcroft and zbigniew 
brzezinski who was president carters national security adviser 
i mean to win this election bush said repeatedly last week 
and dukakis finally heeded his worried supporters pleas to take a 
more combative aggressive stance against bush 
the democratic nominee stepped up the attack at a news 
conference saturday in which he denounced the vice president for 
employing three senior advisers who also are partners in a 
washington lobbying firm hired by the government of the bahamas to 
improve its image among reagan administration officials 
dukakis released a memo by the firm of charles r black paul j 
manafort and roger j stone which boasted of the companys 
influence inside the administration and listed more than a dozen 
contacts in bushs office

been sympathetic to nazis and nazi organizations including jerome 
brentar who resigned as cochairman of a bush campaign 
organization for ethnic groups when it was disclosed that he once 
defended convicted nazi war criminal john demjanjuk 
i think it says a great deal about that campaign dukakis 
said it says a great deal about the judgment of mr bush 
the moral clock is ticking on the bush campaign said rep 
charles schumer dny on saturday calling for the resignations 
of florian galdau and philip guarino two members of bushs 
coaliton of american nationalities who he said had ties to 
fascist pronazi and antisemitic organizations 
dukakis also twitted bush as president of the senate for never 
proposing that senators recite the pledge of allegiance as part of 
their legislative business 
that comment and his reference to pledging allegiance to only 
one flag was the nominees response to bushs frequent criticism 
of dukakis for vetoing a state bill aimed at requiring public 
school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the pledge 
dukakis says he was advised that the bill was unconstitutional 
bentsen toured the los angeles county sheriffs operation safe 
streets program in the carson area a major site of violent gang 
activities and took the occasion to blast bushs role in the 
administrations antidrug campaign 
the ultimate irony of the reaganbush popgun war on drugs is 
the role of the vice president the texas senator said they 
asked him to lead the battle and he blew it badly 
bentsen said bush talks tough on crugs but while he has been 
talking america has lost control of our borders the 
unprecedented influx of drugs has turned californias youth gangs 
into heavily armed wellorganized deadly criminal cartels 
he added the fact is this administration has botched the war 
on drugs theyre trying to fight that battle with eight cabinet 
officers 26 federal agencies but only one general and his name 
is noriega panamanian leader manuel noriega has been indicted in 
the united states for drug trafficking 
bentsens gop counterpart dan quayle relaxed at his home in 
the virginian suburbs of washington with plans to attend his sons 
soccer game he departs monday on a campaign swing through 
michigan wisconsin north dakota colorado and new mexico 
trying to lay to rest another controversy from his past the 
indiana senator told reporters friday that i got into law school 
fair and square nothing improper was done and no rules were 
broken 
he was responding to questions about a report in the cleveland 
plain dealer indicating that he entered indiana university law 
school under a program intended primarily to benefit minority 
students 
the reagan white house did its part to boost bushs candidacy on 
saturday 
in his weekly radio speech president reagan said the nations 
schools are improving because for the past eight years he and bush 
have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand the 
boast immediately drew a denial from senate democratic leader 
robert c byrd 
white house press spokesman marlin fitzwater in a television 
interview on john mclaughlins one on one said bush was a 
very strong leader and a personable friend

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen said saturday that illegal narcotics flooded the nation 
while vice president george bush directed a botched popgun war 
against drugs 
the vice president talks tough on drugs but while he has been 
talking america has lost control of our borders the texas 
senator said at an outdoor rally attended by several hundred 
supporters 
the ultimate irony of the reaganbush popgun war on drugs is 
the role of the vice president bentsen said they asked him to 
lead the battle and he blew it 
he said that after bush was named head of the drug interdiction 
task force in 1983 he did so badly that the head of the drug 
enforcement agency called for abolishment of the program 
on george bushs watch the international production of drugs 
the flow of drugs into this country and the use of drugs all 
increased dramatically he said 
bentsen criticized plans by republican nominee bush to have his 
vice presidential running mate dan quayle head a new antidrug 
effort in a recent newspaper interview a reporter had to inform 
quayle that bush had directed the reagan administrations efforts 
now he wants to pass the torch of incompetence on to the 
junior senator from indiana who is so disinterested that he didnt 
even know that his running mate had been head bentsen said 
the fact is this administration has botched the war on 
drugs he said theyre trying to fight that battle with eight 
cabinet officers 26 federal agencies but only one general and 
his name is noriega referring to panamanian leader manuel 
noriega who is under us indictment for alleged drug trafficking 
bentsen promised that a dukakis administration would name one 
person to head the drug eradication effort and wont coddle drug 
dictators like noriega 
he needled the bush campain for its ties to lobbyists 
some of the top lieutenants of the vice president have been 
accepting hundreds of thousand of dollars as paid agents of foreign 
governments under investigation today for drug trafficking he 
said 
well cut off foreign aid to governments that refuse to 
cooperate with us in the war on drugs said bentsen pledging 
increased support for federal antidrug agencies and more 
coordination with local law enforcement officials 
the reagan administration has tried to slash funds to assist 
state and local governments in their drug enforcement efforts he 
said 
the unprecedented influx of drugs has turned californias 
youth gangs into heavily armed well organized deadly criminal 
cartels said bentsen who earlier visited a los angeles area 
plagued by gang warfare 
accompanied by sen alan cranston dcalif bentsen viewed 
knives guns and a bulletridden car as he toured the carson area 
where the los angeles county sheriffs office is running an 
operation safe streets program 
just hours earlier four people standing in a crowd were shot 
from a passing car in what the sheriffs office said was a gang 
incident 
when we talk about waging this war we have a lot more to 
do bentsen said before he was shown militarytype assault 
weapons sawedoff shotguns and the other weapons confiscated in 
the area 
as for gun control laws bentsen said i think a waiting 
period for the purchase of handguns is a reasonable limitation 
he added that he preferred this be done at a states option 
indicating he might oppose pending legislation that would impose a 
national waiting period 
bentsen was making his third trip to california since receiving 
the vice presidential nomination in july he and democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis are planning several return 
trips in a bid for the states 47 electoral votes the most of any 
state

david wilson loves getting thrown 
around in dwarftossing contests and shrugs off bitter criticisms 
of the practice by associations for little people 
i think its a lot of fun said the 4foot5 human 
projectile if eddie murphy can make fun of being black if dom 
deluise can make fun of being fat why not me why cant i make fun 
of being short 
im into it im an entertainer 
he also works as a welder and circus entertainer i eat fire 
eat nails walk on broken glass he said 
wilson 27 is next slated for a show sept 1315 at a downtown 
bar animal house with a 1000 prize for the winner 
wilson wholl be wearing a crash helmet knee pads and a 
harness for contestants to grab says hell be rooting for 
participants to outdistance the 7feet 8inch distance he was 
tossed in a bradenton bar last summer 
dwarfism groups hate the idea 
from the standpoint of little people its demeaning said 
robert van etten former president of little people of america 
which represents about 4000 dwarfs 
its meanspirited it moves us back to the dark ages its 
poking fun at a minority group said van etten noting that 
public outcry helped kill plans for a dwarfthrowing contest in 
chicago in 1985 
manatee county commissioners didnt like the bradenton dwarf 
toss but couldnt find a law under which they could ban it 
i think we all pretty much felt like it was lowlevel type of 
entertainment said commission chairman kent chetlain its 
like somebody capitalizing on someones disfigurement or 
infirmity 
animal house publicist richard levy brushed off such 
contentions saying the contest is fun attracts customers and is 
certain to generate publicity for the bar 
and wilson said he makes good money being tossed 
dwarftossing began as a bar stunt in queensland australia 
said van ettens wife angela author of dwarfs dont live in doll 
houses 
it is actually freak show entertainment the sort of thing you 
saw in the 1930s she said the problem with freak show 
entertainment is it sets the dwarf apart as something to be stared 
out and made fun of which makes it difficult for the rest of us 
who arent participating to be treated as equal

lech walesa and other solidarity leaders 
saturday demanded an end to government reprisals against workers 
who went on strike and said authorities should be prepared to 
consider legalizing the labor group 
walesa key solidary advisers and other activists gathered in a 
roman catholic church to plan their strategy for talks with 
authorities on the future of the outlawed labor movement 
they issued a statement late saturday saying they wanted 
confirmation that authorities are prepared to create conditions 
for legalizing solidarity which was suspended in 1981 and 
subsequently outlawed 
the weekend conference is one of the largest gatherings of the 
polish opposition in years 
the meeting saturday included solidarity regional leaders and 
strike committee members and a gathering sunday is to include 
intellectuals and cultural figures who advise solidarity founder 
walesa 
the group is meeting to discuss the communist governments offer 
to enter negotiations on aug 31 authorities agreed to open talks 
and walesa agreed to end a 19day wave of strikes 
andrzej stelmachowski a roman catholic intellectual acting as a 
mediator between the governent and opposition said he expected the 
gpvermmentsolidarity talks would begin in the middle of the week 
diplomatic sources said they were told the meeting would begin 
sept 15 
at the end of saturdays meeting the solidarity leadership 
released a statement saying we expect a clear expression by the 
polish authorities of readiness to create conditions for legal 
functioning of solidarity 
only the legalization of solidarity allows the effective 
participation of the union in reforming the country 
the statement also demanded an end to reprisals against workers 
who had participated in strikes 
actions such as detentions firings and induction of strike 
participants into the military impair the credibility of the 
authorities proposals it said we expect an immediate end to 
repressions 
union activists have reported about 350 miners were fired 
following strikes in the coal region of southern poland and dozens 
of other workers received army draft notices 
solidarity sources speaking with the condition of anonymity 
said the statement should not be considered an ultimatum and the 
roundtable talks could begin even without official gestures 
tadeusz mazowiecki an adviser to walesa said solidarity wanted 
a signal from authorities that the talks could be held in serious 
conditions with a chance for success 
mazowiecki said walesa and representatives of four regional 
strike committees would represent solidarity at the talks with the 
government 
saturdays meeting was held at st brygidas church near the 
lenin shipyard where solidarity was born in 1980 amid nationwide 
strikes and became the first free trade union in the soviet bloc 
attending the meeting were the 15member national executive 
commission of solidarity representatives of strike committees 
during the aug 16sept 3 wave of strikes and members of the 
interfactory strike committees 
among the 40 participants were solidarity advisers such as jacek 
kuron adam michnik and zbigniew romaszewski who monitor human 
rights abuses 
nearby in another church leaders of the banned independent 
students association met and drafted a statement in support of 
solidarity 
im surprised by the way these people are prepared walesa 
said during a break in the session 
there are a lot of fighting people who i expected to represent 
their fighting manner and i am surprised by their great feeling of 
responsibility and great wisdom especially among the young 
people 
solidarity is seeking to win back the legal status it lost 
following polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelskis dec 13 1981 
martiallaw crackdown 
government spokesman jerzy urban and politburo member alfred 
miodowicz leader of the officially sanctioned trade union opzz 
last week reiterated the official stand that solidarity cannot be 
legalized again as a trade federation but urban also said 
officials were entering the talks with no preconditions 
opposition spokesmen said they insist on the legalization of the 
union and they want the issue settled before they will engage in 
talks on the broad range of political and economic problems 
the talks to discuss workers grievances were proposed by 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak during the august strikes 
polands worst wave of labor unrest since 1981 
when kiszczak and walesa met aug 31 they agreed that the talks 
could include discussing the future of solidarity walesa then 
appealed to his supporters for a speedy end to the remaining 
strikes so the talks could convene 
col stanislaw kwiatkowski the chief government pollster said 
the authorities have no one to blame but themselves for being 
forced back into talks with walesa and solidarity 
briefly stated it is the sluggishness of the party and the 
government which are to blame for the rebirth of solidarity whose 
cadres have begun to count again in the political game 
kwiatkowski said in the warsaw daily zycie warszawy

two former guerrillas of an underground jewish 
group once led by prime minister yitzhak shamir said they helped 
assassinate a swedish un envoy to palestine 40 years ago 
according to a television program 
it was the first time that members of the stern group 
acknowledged they were involved in the killing of count folke 
bernadotte israels staterun educational television said 
the militant group also known as israel freedom fighters was 
initially headed by avraham stern it was a splinter faction of the 
rightwing national military organization 
the faction which carried out terrorist acts to undermine 
british rule in mandatory palestine opposed bernadottes proposals 
that the united nations be given control over jerusalem and key 
areas be returned to arab jurisdiction 
in 1942 after british police fatally shot stern the group was 
led by shamir natan yellinmor and yisrael scheibeldad the 
groups ideologist 
in interviews for educational television aired friday two 
former members of the group said that yellinmor and scheibeldad 
approved the assassination 
the organization officially disbanded about four months before 
the killing and shamir had no connection with the assassination 
said his spokesman yossi ahimeir 
although members of the group may have been involved ahimeir 
said there was no organization at the time and shamir was not a 
commander 
asked about shamirs response to the tv report ahimeir said the 
prime minister is dealing with the issues of present and future 
and not with the distant past 
the issue was not expected to have any effect on upcoming 
elections israelis have believed for years that the stern group 
was behind the killing 
journalist dan margalit interviewed yehoshua zetler and meshulam 
makover who he said were the mastermind and the driver in 
bernadottes killing 
margalit quoted zetler as saying he decided to kill bernadotte 
president of the swedish red cross during and after world war ii 
after the envoy proposed the formation of a union of an arab and a 
jewish state 
bernadotte was appointed in may 1948 to negotiate a ceasefire 
and recommend a settlement in israels 1948 war of independence 
zetler said he conferred with eldad and the two traveled to 
haifa to discuss it with yellinmor yellinmor demanded that after 
the killing the israel freedom fighters deny its role and blame 
the slaying on a tiny group of zealots called the homeland front 
margalit said 
scheibeldad now an elderly philosophy lecturer living in 
jerusalem said in a telephone interview he could not comment 
because zetler and makover were talking about the operational 
side and i was the ideologist i have no way of knowing if their 
account is correct 
the television program quoted makover as saying the guerrillas 
arrived in two cars to the spot selected by zetler for the sept 
17 1948 killing in downtown jerusalem 
when the threecar un convoy approached the narrow street the 
jeep blocked its way and three guerrillas jumped outside with 
makover staying behind the wheel it said 
makover was quoted as saying guerrilla yehoshua cohen fired the 
shots that killed bernadotte 
the assassination was widely blamed on the israel freedom 
fighters and the israeli government launched a nationwide hunt for 
its members about 400 people including yellinmor were arrested 
but the killers were never found 
scheibeldad said most of those detained were released but some 
faced trial for membership in an illegal organization 
the organization was disbanded in may 1948 and most of the 
members joined the israeli army but it preserved a separate status 
in jerusalem until it was outlawed after bernadottes assassination 
in september 
yellinmor and matitiyahu shmulevitch also a group member were 
sentenced to short jail terms and pardoned when the first knesset 
or parliament convened in 1949 scheibeldad said

the foreign ministers of iran and iraq met 
saturday for their first facetoface peace talks in more than two 
weeks 
but talks were halted after less than four hours suggesting an 
impasse over iraqs refusal to move the negotiations to new york 
and irans support of a recess and change of location 
un officials said the negotiations would resume on sunday 
foreign minister tariq aziz led the iraqi delegation to the 
meeting at the un office in geneva the iranians headed by 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati came less than five minutes 
later 
as at their previous full meetings in geneva the two 
delegations sat down at separate tables about 30 feet apart in the 
council chamber of the un building the mediator jan eliasson 
was seated at his own table at the head of the triangular 
arrangement 
saturdays session was the first direct session at ministerial 
level since the second day of talks aug 26 
earlier an iraqi official was quoted as saying baghdad refused 
to suspend negotiations and move them to new york 
sadoon hamadi iraqs minister of state for foreign affairs was 
quoted in a newspaper interview as spelling out his sides 
position which clashes with tehrans willingness to consider a 
break and shift of venue 
there is no justification to move the negotiations to new 
york because iraq iran and the un secretarygeneral agreed on 
geneva as the place for these negotiations hamadi said in an 
interview published saturday in the abu dhabi daily alittihad 
he said the talks are passing through a difficult stage and 
accused iran of trying to scuttle them from the start 
the un had no immediate official word on whether the latest 
conflict has been resolved 
among irans priorities at the talks are a withdrawal of troops 
to internationally recognized boundaries exchange of war prisoners 
and a un investigation to determine who started the war 
a longstanding dispute concerns a 1975 treaty setting the 
iraniraq boundary down the middle of the shattalarab waterway 
iraq has renounced the pact and claimed the entire waterway but 
iran says it still considers the treaty valid 
the waterway has been blocked by sunken ships and silt nearly 
since the start of the war in september 1980 
in nicosia cyprus the foreign ministers conference of the 
101nation nonaligned movement called on iraq and iran to 
cooperate in good faith with the secretarygeneral for full 
implementation of the unsponsored ceasefire 
earlier iranian deputy foreign minister mohammed hussein 
lavasani charged iraq was preventing progress in geneva by raising 
extraneous issues in the talks 
iraqs deputy foreign minister wissam alzahawi told a plenary 
session iran was trying to create a crisis in the negotiations

the chairman of the american stock 
exchange hurled a symbolic pitch saturday to mark the delivery of a 
shipment of baseball equipment to nicaraguans at a refugee camp in 
honduras 
arthur levitt jr the exchange chairman said another shipment 
will be delivered to the refugees later and a third will be given 
to hondurans 
baseball has been a popular nicaraguan sport since the us 
military intervention in the 1920s 
hundreds of refugees looked wideeyed at the bats balls and 
gloves donated by us major league baseball teams and sporting 
goods manufacturers 
this makes me happy said sabel correa 28 who fled 
nicaragua six years ago and at one time was a rebel fighting the 
sandinista government baseball is important to nicaraguans 
juan enrique gomez who said he left nicaragua two years ago to 
escape being drafted into the army agreed he said the camp at 
jacaleapa has four adult basebll teams and two junior leagues 
theres not much else to do he said 
the 517 helmets 2400 gloves 1600 bats 800 caps 700 balls 
and 500 tshirts delivered saturday by a us military transport 
plane will be shared among 13000 nicaraguans in three unrun 
refugee camps in honduras 
levitt who is cochairman of the international commisson for 
central american recovery and development said the idea for 
providing baseball equipment emerged in 1987 when he visited the 
jacaleapa camp 60 miles east of the capital of tegucigalpa 
as you can see there are vast numbers of children here with 
nothing to do he said standing amid the rows of wooden shacks 
that house more than 6000 people 
he said he approached baseball commissioner peter ueberroth 
about providing equipment and the response was great 
levitt walked among crowds of children in tattered clothes many 
of them too young to remember their homeland their families fled 
nicaragua shortly after the leftwing sandinistas ousted the 
government of president anastasio somoza in july 1979 
many other refugees here crossed the border because of the 
6yearold war between the usbacked rebels known as contras and 
the sandinistas 
oscar grenado 12 said his family left nicaragua in 1981 he 
said his father and a brother were both contra and were killed 
fighting the sandinistas a sister and another brother are still 
with the contras he said 
i really learn baseball he said quietly adjusting his 
baseball hat 
scores of youths took part in a training session led by rafael 
avila a cubanborn scout for the los angeles dodgers 
i tell them i never saw a city until i was 14 and three years 
later i was playing major league ball avila said

hospital officials said israeli troops firing regular bullets 
wounded four palestinians in clashes in and around nablus and at

parts of the city where 125000 palestinians live were under 
curfew while other areas were declared closed military zones he

qalqilya

five days as soldiers conduct housetohouse searches and make 
arrests at least 200 suspected palestinian activists have been 
detained in the largest military operation since the start of the

reporter who visited the village 
in southern lebanon israeli troops captured four guerrillas 
after seriously wounding one of them in a brief firefight saturday

year but for a lifetime if thats what it takes

these changes are merely part of a natural process and do not spell 
doom for our hopes lewis said

rights are to improve with time 
there are going to be some setbacks he said but we are 
going to move toward the beloved community we are going to make it 
as a people and as a nation

the last emperor officially premiered in 
beijing saturday with little fanfare and less than a full house 
drawing few luminaries and only scattered applause 
originally set for sept 27 the official premiere of the 
acclaimed film about the life of chinas last emperor henry pu yi 
was moved up at the last minute 
associate producer franco giovale who is in beijing working on 
another movie was the only representative from the west who 
attended he said he was informed of the saturday afternoon 
screening only three days in advance 
director bernardo bertolucci was in his hometown of parma 
italy and unable to make the trip on short notice giovale said 
also missing was chinas vice minister of culture ying ruochen 
an actor who played the prison warden and leading members of the 
government and culturual circles 
the official xinhua news agency said the premiere was moved up 
at the request of chinese cinema managers anxious to show the 
italianchinese coproduction that has won international acclaim 
selected theaters in beijing and shanghai have had special 
screenings that have drawn large crowds of chinese eager to see why 
the film won nine oscars and to compare it with a chinese tv series 
of the same name 
however the audience at the premier filled only threequarters 
of the cinema in beijings nationalities palace and one woman said 
she came only because a friend had given her the free ticket 
although the audience reacted with laughter at the antics of the 
baby emperor and cheered during the scenes of zealous red guards 
marching through the streets during the cultural revolution there 
was only brief and scattered applause when the credits rolled 
some have criticized the movie which was shot in china as 
being inaccurate and others say it represents a foreigners view 
of china 
its likely that some chinese audiences will be unhappy with 
that said chen haosu vice minister of radio film and 
television the highest government official who attended the 
premiere 
but why should we ask the foreign director to make films the 
same as we are used to seeing he asked in his remarks at the 
movies premiere 
chen said the film helped introduce china to millions

a group of idled airline passengers used the power 
of the pocketbook to avert a long layover on a portugese island 
paying to refuel a boeing 737 after an airport refused the pilots 
credit card british airways said saturday 
the airline said the pilot of the londonbound flight raised 
2000 from among the 100 passengers after the porto santo airport 
refused to accept the standard credit card used by pilots for 
refueling costs 
one passenger even kicked in 1000 said an airline spokesman 
speaking on condition of anonymity the airline reimbursed the 
passengers on the sept 3 flight when they arrived at londons 
gatwick airport he said 
the snafu occurred during what should have been a routine 
refueling stop on the island in the north atlantic ocean the 
spokesman said 
the flight originated on the island of funchal which like porto 
santo is in the madeira island group 
british airways initially had planned to use a gibralta airways 
aircraft for the flight but because of a scheduling change used a 
chartered caledonian airways aircraft 
when the flight landed at porto santo to refuel the ground 
staff refused to accept the credit card because the aircraft was 
not the one the airport had been expecting the spokesman said 
he said the fuel collection was a bit unorthodox but it was 
done to save time it is the first time i have heard of such a 
situation occurring 
he said british airways has filed a complaint with the airport

rain fell on old faithful 
on saturday as thousands of firefighters faced high wind that 
fanned already enormous forest fires and cabinetlevel officials 
inspected damage to the oldest national park 
a nearby mining town was evacuated and nonessential people were 
sent out of park headquarters 
a storm with winds up to 30 mph and gusts of up to 40 mph 
measured near mammoth moved south and east through wyoming saturday 
afternoon 
but in most areas of yellowstone things didnt get quite as 
intense as they thought probably they would said linda miller a 
spokeswoman at park headquarters at mammoth hot springs 
about a quarter inch of rain fell in the lake yellowstone area 
while scattered showers hit most of the southern half of the park 
fire information officials said puddles gathered in the roads and 
the rain quieted fire activity by increasing humidity in the area 
all roads and entrances were closed to visitors saturday and 
reporters had to travel in convoys escorted by park personnel 
were making sure people dont get into situations they cant get 
out of said yellowstone spokeswoman marty tobias 
interior secretary donald hodel agriculture secretary richard 
lyng and deputy defense secretary william howard taft iv arrived at 
west yellowstone mont where they were briefed in private by fire 
and weather officials before going to old faithful geyser and 
flying over the park 
i didnt think id ever see anything quite like mount st 
helens but i did here lyng said 
fires have charred more than 906000 acres of the 
22millionacre park adding destruction in the national forests 
and parks surrounding the park in idaho montana and wyoming pushes 
the figure to over 12 million burned acres 
fires also burned in alaska california colorado utah and 
washington 
so far this year western fires have burned nearly 38 million 
acres an area larger than connecticut in what officials call the 
worst fire season in 30 years that includes some 2 million acres 
in alaska 
the 229400acre north fork fire had burned to within a mile of 
mammoth hot springs and was slowly bearing down on the area fire 
managers said nearly 400 firefighters were on hand to protect 
buildings 
the mammoth hot springs inn the last of the lodging facilities 
available in yellowstone was closed friday it had been scheduled 
to stay open for the season until sept 19 
the 650 residents of gardiner mont which is at the north 
entrance to yellowstone and five miles north of mammoth hot 
springs stood ready to evacuate 
jardine mont a mining community of 100 to 150 people four 
miles from gardiner was evacuated saturday because its only escape 
route was through a canyon to gardiner said betty schmitt of 
gallatin national forest in montana 
a review of national park service policy on fighting wildfires 
will likely lead to changes after this years devastating fires in 
the west hodel said 
in light of what has happened we recognize you simply fight 
every fire as hard as you can from the beginning hodel said to 
cheers from townspeople in the audience at a news conference in 
west yellowstone mont 
i think theyd have to change hodel said of the park 
services socalled let burn policy in which natural fires are 
allowed to burn except where they threaten lives or property 
in washington state the bodies of two men were recovered 
saturday from the burned wreckage of a helicopter that disappeared 
friday while fighting that states largest forest fire a 
46000acre blaze said forest service spokesman greg thayer the 
craft was found near a ridgetop north of wenatchee and recovery 
teams had to ride helicopters to the top of the ridge and hike down 
chelan county sheriff joe collins said the hu204 huey 
helicopter apparently snagged its empty water bucket on some trees 
and crashed collins said the victims were believed to be canadians 
last month one person died in the crash of a helicopter 
involved in battling a blaze in wyomings bighorn national forest 
the first death directly attributable to fires this year 
occurred last week in glacier national park in montana when a 
firefighter was struck by a falling burning tree

the childrens museum sent its 
2500yearold mummy to the hospital saturday to learn more about 
the ancient woman from egypt 
during her visit to indiana university hospital wenuhotep got 
her picture taken with a threedimensional ct scan that provided a 
neverbeforeseen view of her face 
we found much finer pictures than i would have expected of the 
bones these were incredibly clear and detailed images of the 
skull the tissues the internal bones of the skull said robert 
pickering curator of anthropology for the museum 
pickering said the xrays could be used later as the basis for 
artistic renderings to show what wenuhoteps face looked like 
the physical anthropologist said the scan also showed in detail 
the hole used to remove wenuhoteps brain during the mummification 
process as well as resins and linen wrappings used to preserve the 
body 
we also cleared up an old problem he said in xrays 
taken about 1967 it appears there was a fracture of the left hip 
we were able to show pretty conclusively there was not a fracture 
of the hip in fact the hip appears to be normal 
interest in wenuhotep has increased dramatically in the two 
weeks since frank j yurco a egyptological consultant from the 
field museum in chicago performed new studies on her 
until then scholars thought wenuhotep and her family were only 
of minor importance but yurco discovered that she was a pivotal 
mummy meaning she provides totally new information about ancient 
egypt 
yurcos detailed readings of the art and hieroglyphics on the 
coffin indicate wenuhoteps father horemhat was a high priest 
of thoth the most important deity of the time 
yurcos study of the decoration on the coffin indicated that 
wenuhotep lived between 525 and 400 bc 200 years earlier than 
scholars previously thought that she lived during a persian rule 
of egypt and that she was a woman of wealth and power in her own 
right

investigators worked saturday to determine 
what caused a cloud of steam or smoke to drift onto interstate 26 
leading to a 17vehicle pileup that killed four people and injured 
16 others 
i wouldnt even attempt to try to state a cause of the 
wreck said state highway patrol trooper vr burkett its still 
under investigation 
witnesses said the road was wet from a fine mist when the 
accident occurred friday after a cloud suddenly blocked visibility 
some witnesses suggested the cloud was steam from a nearby national 
welders supply co plant but company officials denied that was 
possible 
burkett said five tractortrailers and 12 other vehicles were 
involved in the wreck which occurred about 430 pm about 15 
miles south of here the highway was closed for 9 hours 
five people remained hospitalized saturday in stable or good 
condition eleven others were treated and released 
the dead were claire bowie 44 an interior designer from 
orangeburg robert adams felker 5 of whitmire and two other 
persons whose identities were being withheld until they were 
positively confirmed authorities said 
ruby hammond a witness said there was some steam coming 
from this plant over there up in the air and all of a sudden it 
just dropped 
but plant manager gerald carver said he did not believe the 
welding supply company plant had anything to do with the accident 
he said some gases are regularly released from the plant but they 
normally dissipate within 10 feet of the 115foot distillation 
tower 
a review of our operation indicates everything was normal at 
the time of the accident he said 
carmen malphrus who was treated at a hospital and released 
said she initially thought the cloud was harmless 
i saw all these other cars going into the fog so i just 
assumed its not that thick i guess everyones going into it 
she said then once i was in it i realized there was no 
visibility 
then all of a sudden bam bam bam all of these cars started 
hitting each other and then you heard screaming it was a huge 
wreck she said 
today was my birthday she added so maybe god just gave 
me a birthday present and let me live

that she contemplated suicide when she discovered what the american 
writer intended to publish in his book the lives of john 
lennon

sell more records if he pretended not to be attached to one woman 
but he refused 
neither of us was an angel but we cherished and loved each 
moment we were together and were always frightened of losing each 
other ono was quoted as saying

toes lottie chinn said after her home burned in a fire blamed by 
authorities on arsonists 
ms chinn was appointed last month by mayor w wilson goode to 
his new leadership antidrug council goode ordered a full 
investigation of fridays fire that heavily damaged ms chinns 
home 
ms chinn 47 organized and led three antidrug marches in her 
neighborhood in june she has stood with neighbors in front of drug 
houses and demanded that the dealers leave 
if the arson was in retaliation for her antidrug work goode 
said then it is one more tragic example of the recklessness of 
drug dealers in the city and reaffirms the resolve of this 
administration to push even harder to drive the pushers out of the 
city 
arsonists used a fivegallon plastic container to carry 
flammable liquid to the second floor of ms chinns home 
investigators said the fluid was poured in a rear bedroom and down 
a back staircase

city council members rallied with tenants of a public housing 
complex abbottsford homes where some tenants reported threats 
dorothy and betty who spoke on condition their last names not 
be used said they received death threats after five people were 
arrested on drug charges last month in the complex in june the 
two had helped lead tenants through the complex chanting slogans 
such as drug dealers got to go 
that slogan was mimicked by the death threat displayed by betty 
newsy neighbors got to go before you land on death row the 
message was accompanied by a stick figure drawing of a person with 
a noose around the neck and beside it the words this is you 
gregory kern executive director of the philadelphia housing 
authority said he was negotiating with police to open a 
minipolice station at abbottsford 
castille said he and kern would try to enforce new federal 
legislation that enables district attorneys to facilitate the 
eviction of alleged drugdealing tenants from public housing units 
while the housing authority already has the power to evict those 
who sell drugs from their apartments those evictions come slowly

foreign ministers of the 101nation 
nonaligned movement closed a fourday meeting early sunday after 
adopting resolutions condemning israel and south africa 
in their political report the ministers said there was 
increased cooperation between israel and south africa and 
expressed indignation and dismay that certain western nations 
continued to aid and abet apartheid economically financially 
politically diplomatically and militarily 
they noted with regret that despite efforts to press 
leading industrialized countries to impose mandatory economic 
sanctions against whiteruled south africa the un security 
council had again been prevented from adopting sanctions by 
american and british vetoes 
the document expressed disappointment that japan increased its 
trade with south africa whose apartheid policies establish a 
racially segregated society in which the 5 million whites control 
the country and the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs 
it called on member states to begin in earnest the stockpiling 
of relief materials for appropriate use in support of the 
frontline and other states in southern africa to assist them to 
withstand reprisals by south africa 
south africa has been accused of launching raids in neighboring 
black countries to strike at the african national congress the 
main guerrilla group fighting the whiteled government 
the final document strongly condemned the hypocrisy of the 
us administration and the pretoria racist regime for talking 
peace in namibia while continuing to provide military support to 
the unita rebels fighting the marxist government in angola 
with regard to the palestinian attempts to establish a homeland 
in the west bank and gaza strip the report said the ministers 
saluted the heroic uprising of the palestinian people in the 
israeli occupied territories 
it said the uprising was tangible evidence of their 
determination to have a state of their own which proves the 
futility of the israeli efforts to continue the occupation of 
palestine 
the final report also said a middle east settlement should be 
based on the right of the palestinian people to 
selfdetermination and their right to establish an independent and 
sovereign palestinian state in their national homeland palestine 
the report called on both iraq and iran to cooperate in good 
faith with the un secretarygeneral for full implementation of 
the unsponsored ceasefire in the persian gulf war which went 
into effect on aug 20 
the nonaligned movement was formed in 1961 by nations claiming 
not to be aligned with the east or west 
before adjourning the foreign ministers decided early sunday 
that yugoslavia will host next years summit meeting and have the 
chairmanship for the next three years

newspaper and magazine editors are less 
likely to split hairs these days over split infinitives according 
to an indiana university english usage survey 
its time to boldly go where few editors have gone before 
said the response of the allentown call a pennsylvania newspaper 
participating in the survey if the sentence would be awkward 
otherwise we should split the infinitive and not split hairs 
the move was in sharp contrast to the universitys language 
survey in 1981 when 88 percent of the editors said they would obey 
one of the most ancient of grammatical rules never split an 
infinitive 
the copy chiefs were asked if they would shift the word 
instantly in the following sentence the estimated 100 
million americans whose relatives arrived in the united states at 
ellis island will be able to instantly trace their history at the 
new computerized genealogical center planned for the restored 
immigration site 
about half 52 percent said they would not change the 
sentence which appeared in the new york times however the times 
assistant managing editor allan m siegal objected to his papers 
split of the infinitive to trace 
it was a violation of our own policy siegal said we 
split an infinitive when we cannot gracefully avoid doing so in 
this case the graceful placement of the adverb would have been 
after history split infinitives arent wrong but they annoy so 
many readers that they should be avoided when possible 
but the indianapolis star disagreed with the times splitting 
infinitives is no longer a slavish matter we treat them 
individually rather than a matter of course 
many newspaper and magazine editors found failure to split an 
infinitive awkward in certain contexts most infinitives are split 
by an intensive modifier as in to really try to honestly 
believe and to heartily support 
other findings of the survey included a rejection of the word 
chairperson instead of chairwoman or chairman and a

the iraqi foreign minister said saturday 
that a us senate call for economic sanctions against his country 
for allegedly using chemical weapons against kurdish rebels was 
ridiculous and unacceptable 
kurdish separatists praised the senate action which they said 
came amid continued heavy fighting in iraqs mountainous north 
minister of information latif nassayif jassim denied all reports 
accusing iraq of using chemical weapons against the rebellious 
kurds the official iraqi news agency reported 
ina quoted jassem as saying all the allegations aired by 
certain political and media circles are ridiculous 
he called the senate vote unacceptable and said america cannot 
speak out about human rights while it is arming israels forces for 
their attacks against palestinians according to the agency 
iraqs latest offensive against kurdish separatists began soon 
after a unmediated ceasefire was accepted aug 20 by iran and 
iraq in their 8yearold war many kurdish separatists had backed 
iran in the conflict 
the us senate voted friday to condemn iraqs alleged poison 
gas attacks on its kurdish minority and to impose stiff economic 
sanctions aimed at throttling iraqs ability to pay off its 
estimated 60billion debt 
the measure following the state departments announcement that 
it had proof of the attacks still must be approved by the house of 
representatives and signed by president reagan 
a spokesman for the kurdish rebels said the senate action proved 
the separatists accusations about chemical weapons 
the us has its own evidence through its own sources which 
proves what weve been saying for a month the spokesman said in 
a telephone interview with the associated press in cyprus he spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman speaking from a european capital where he 
maintains radio contact with the insurgents said the fighting is 
continuing in the northern kurdish regions 
he said iraqi forces were concentrated along the border with 
turkey where he claimed 40000 kurds trying to escape were trapped 
we are trying to rescue as many people as we can but we 
havent had much news from them in the last few days he said 
adding that there was heavy fighting sept 6 and 7 
he said 80 iraqis were killed in the fighting in the northern 
amadiyeh district sept 7 and most rebel fighters had withdrawn in 
sidikan on sept 6 iraq launched a massive attack and lost 200 
of its soldiers in the battle according to the spokesman 
he said 250 guerrillas had been killed since aug 26 last week 
the rebels said 2000 civilians have been killed and 5000 wounded 
many in chemical bomb attacks 
chemical weeapons are banned internationally under the 1925 
geneva accords 
diplomats in baghdad said that since march iraq has demolished 
scores of kurdish villages in the north moving the inhabitants to 
blocks of concrete apartment buildings in larger cities

president reagan on friday signed into law a 
measure that for the first time requires commercial fishing vessels 
to carry life rafts and other emergency equipment 
the signing caps a threeyear campaign for approval of safety 
regulations for an industry whose safety record is the worst in the 
united states 
rep john miller rwash who attended the private signing 
ceremony and was one of the original sponsors of the measure said 
reagan called it a good bill that will save lives 
the measure requires that commercial fishing vessels carry life 
rafts survival suits emergency transmitters and medical supplies 
among the leading proponents of the legislation were robert and 
peggy barry whose son peter drowned when a 70yearold fishing 
vessel from seattle sank off alaska in the summer of 1985 the 
vessel did not carry life rafts radio equipment or survival suits 
and investigators concluded the ship should not have been at sea 
the fact the bill was finally signed into law is a great 
relief to all of us who have lost relatives or friends in the 
fishing industry said robert barry 
he said more needs to be done including manadatory inspections 
on a regular basis licensing of operators and training of crews 
an average of about 80 fishermen die annually in accidents 
involving commercial fishing vessels according to coast guard 
statistics 
rep mike lowry dwash said the rate of accidental deaths for

iraq on friday accused iran of wasting time in 
negotiations for a settlement of their 8yearold war and the un 
mediator was reported ready to call a recess 
a written iraqi statement dismissed irans position as fantasy 
to explain its flight from direct talks lately as a result of the 
instability of the government it represents 
the iraqi statement said negotiations cannot move past basic 
ceasefire arrangements without action on two of the baghdad 
governments demands free navigation in the persian gulf and 
unsupervised clearing of the shattalarab waterway which forms 
the southern frontier 
the waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf has been blocked 
by sunken ships and silt since the early weeks of the war which 
began in september 1980 
on thursday foreign minister ali akbar velayati repeated the 
iranian position that those issues were extraneous elements and 
could be addressed later 
velayati said negotiations have been hung up the agenda 
disagreement since they began aug 25 five days after a ceasefire 
took effect he said irans priority is withdrawal of military 
forces to internationally recognized boundaries 
iraq said iran was giving a false picture and that baghdad had 
stated its position in two letters to un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar before the talks began so the raising of these 
two issues is neither extraneous nor new 
the statement said iran was procrastinating and velayati should 
get down to business 
direct talks occurred only on the first two days in geneva and 
neither velayati nor the iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz has 
met with un mediator jan eliasson since last saturday perez de 
cuellar was mediator when the talks began but put eliasson in 
charge sept 1 
signs increased friday that the talks will recess and resume 
later this month in new york 
un spokeswoman therese gastaut said continuing lowlevel 
indirect contacts were focusing on how to proceed and eliasson 
a swedish diplomat probably would hold a news conference saturday 
or sunday 
sources close to the talks said privately he was expected to 
announce a recess but there still was disagreement over a date for 
resumption

the understanding that she would not be sentenced to more than 10 
years in prison according to probation terms set down by state 
district judge mike mcdonald belona must not become pregannt while 
under court supervision 
according to a police report arell belona died nov 30 1987 
from malnutrition so severe that he appeared mummified the

she could get a ride then she could get food stamps

but had no transportation authorities said the childs weight had 
dropped from about 7 pounds at birth to less than 6 pounds at death

in the seventh grade at age 16 
in addition to a requirement that she not become pregnant

read obtain a high school equivalency certificate and undergo job 
training 
belonas three other children ages 3 2 and 1 appeared not 
to suffer abuse authorities said they have been turned over to

almost 300 meticulously sculpted wax figures at the southwestern 
historical wax museum ranging from elvis presley to john and 
jacqueline kennedy to robert redford and paul newman were lost in

totally destroyed

jerry debo it continued to be a major draw when other 
attractions failed

our firms are now very price competitive because of the 
dollars fall since 1985 and japan is removing trade barriers

penetrate the japanese distribution system in order to reach the 
consumer

the shoreham nuclear plant which 
earlier this year seemed destined for mothballs received a high 
rating for the work of long island lighting co workers in an 
emergency evacuation drill a federal report showed 
the positive report from the federal emergency management agency 
came despite the refusal of state and long island officials to 
cooperate because they claimed evacuation of the island was 
impossible in the event of a real accident 
the shoreham monster is rising from its grave said richard 
kessel the executive director of the state consumer protection 
board and a longtime shoreham opponent after the fema rating was 
issued 
the twoday drill which began june 7 tested how lilco 
responded to a simulated plant accident that required mock 
evacuation of residents living within 10 miles of the plant 
state and local officials said in june that lilco showed it was 
incapable of protecting the public because a majority of emergency 
sirens in the evacuation zone failed or were not heard during the 
drill 
but fema officials said at the time that sounding the sirens was 
not a required part of the exercise 
under current federal regulation the nuclear regulatory 
commission may not license a nuclear plant until there is an 
emergency plan that gives reasonable assurance the public will be 
safe if an accident occurs 
lilco spokesman james lois said fema told the nrc in its report 
friday that the utility proved in the drill that its plan did 
provide reasonable assurance 
according to lois femas evaluation of the june exercise and 
the emergency plan itself support a finding of reasonable assurance 
that the health and the safety of the public will be carried out 
if the plan is acceptable to the nrc licensing board it removes 
emergency planning as an obstacle to issuance of a full power 
operating license for a plant lois said 
kessel saying he was extremely disappointed in the fema 
decision charged the federal agency turned logic upside down 
in its ruling 
earlier this year gov mario cuomo another shoreham opponent 
helped work out a deal to purchase the nuclear plant from lilco 
and shut it down for good but the plan has yet to be approved by 
the legislature meaning that it still is possible for shoreham to 
one day go into operation

cab line owned a couple of recording companies he had me go to the 
hotel and take king to his lawyers office to sign the papers to 
start recording 
edwards parked his cab that day and left with king 
from that date to this one ive been with him 
king started in the early days playing black clubs around the 
country 
that was from the 50s until the early part of the 60s 
edwards said kings fortunes changed when he gueststarred with 
eric clapton jimi hendrix and janis joplin at fillmore west in 
san francisco when he made the record the thrill is gone that 
was the major change 
the crowd now is 75 to 80 percent white deep south the crowd 
is more black edwards said it varies with the territory 
edwards moved to mobile 25 years ago and began operating 
restaurants and nightclubs everything was called be bops

thing thats in a stouffers hotel is in that bus 
when were traveling down the highway people take pictures of 
it from their cars edwards said 
the group does as much flying as bus travel thats all in stark 
contrast to the early days when the band got around in a few 
station wagons and a cadillac back then they were worried about 
being able to use public restrooms because they were segregated and 
black people were not permitted to use them 
edwards said he has kept mobile as his home base because of his 
family and business interests he has stayed despite the lack of 
major entertainment blues or jazz 
the people here are not ready for it he said they wont 
support it a lot of people notice it but its the less supporting 
entertainment city in the world for what reason i dont know

biba abdous children all skin and bones 
were smiling from eartoear as they played beside the familys 
10foodhigh millet crop the best they had ever seen 
my boys are skinny now but soon they will be fat said mrs 
biba whose family farms near karma about 35 miles northwest of 
nigers capital niamey we have never seen rain like this we 
are very content 
for the moment a droughtweary people have reason to smile 
all across west africas sahel abundant rains promise the best 
harvest in two decades 
nothing comes easy in the sahel a huge belt of land on the 
southern fringe of the sahara and the good rains are no exception 
more than 100 lives were lost in torrential rains thousands of 
homes destroyed and some farmland flooded an infestation of 
locusts also threatens some crops although the most immediate 
threat appears to be to the east in sudan 
the niger river rose to levels higher than any recorded in 
august since recordkeeping began in 1928 
scientists at a niamey agricultural weather center set up to 
monitor conditions in nine sahel nations after the disastrous 
197273 drought report the plentiful rain promises good harvests 
good pasturage is available for cattle goats sheep 
the sahel region is generally defined as covering the land south 
of the sahara with annual rainfall averaging from six to 24 inches 
it stretches from mauritania mali and niger in the north into 
northern nigeria and northern cameroon in the south 
many sahel regions had already received more than 14 inches the 
amount needed for millet crops by the end of august more 
important the rain had continued to fall since the beginning of 
june the crop needs rainfall throughout its threemonth growth for 
the best harvests 
the sahel nations burkina faso cape verde senegal niger 
mauritania mali chad guinea bissau and gambia have suffered 
recurring drought or generally inadequate rainfall since 1972 the 
nine nations cover more than 2 million square miles and have a 
population of about 40 million 
amadou djibo who farms with his father and three brothers about 
60 miles northwest of niamey said people werent concerned about 
losing their homes or flooding that had temporarily cut off an 
important road like the marabou storks who circled overhead the 
rains were considered a harbinger of better days 
we can always rebuild a house but if we have no rain we have 
no food he said 
djibo added that his village of zarakoire had not had an 
adequate harvest in seven years and life was hard 
boukar elhadj ousmane nigers minister in charge of animal and 
water resources said the rains had left 13 people dead and 7000 
homeless he also reported 15000 animals including goats sheep 
and cattle lost and about 600 miles of roads left temporarily 
impassable 
heavy rainfall has been reported across west africa extending 
into sudan in east africa where torrential rains and flooding 
resulted in 96 deaths and 200 million in damage 
in the sahel chad reported 45 people dead and 48000 homeless 
and 3500 cattle lost more than 50 people were killed in northern 
nigeria and thousands left homeless two dams burst after the 
heaviest rainfalls in 50 years cameroon and burkina faso also 
reported several deaths and many houses destroyed 
much flood damage was reported near rivers where people had 
moved in close to the water during drought years to plant gardens 
boukar said he could understand the attitude of peasants who 
minimized the importance of the damage and said we can consider 
the rain a blessing 
he added it gives them hope for the future many of those 
people have never seen this kind of rain in their lives they have 
only heard stories about it 
george eaton nigers director of the us agency for 
international development aid which was still distributing food 
donated to meet shortfalls from the last harvest said nigers food 
situation should be good after this harvest 
thats if the locusts dont eat it all or if there is so much 
there is still enough for the people eaton said he had received 
reports of good harvest prospects from aid directors in other sahel 
nations 
this has been a great morale booster even with the locust 
threat he added people are upbeat 
some harvesting already has begun in southern sahel regions 
where crops mature earlier but in most areas millet sorghum and 
other crops will be harvested in the coming weeks 
no one predicts an end to food shortages though given the 
probable reduction in us food aid because of the us drought the 
sahel rains were timely each sahel country has its own troubles 
and the rain certainly would create some problems even if it 
alleviated others 
and no one predicts that the drought cycle had been broken by 
the rains indeed scientists here would make no predictions at 
all noting a meterological institute had predicted three months 
ago that the sahel would experience a very dry year this year 
aid workers expressed concern the good rains will encourage 
pastoralists to rebuild their herds cut by as much as 50 percent 
by the massive 1984 drought to sizes the land cant support 
overgrazing has been a key factor in desertification the process 
by which the sahara claims land 
a pastoralists herd remains his bank and chief wealth in the 
sahel and governments have had little success dissuading their 
herdsmen from overgrazing the fragile land

puerto ricans vote for a governor 
legislators mayors and a nonvoting member of the us congress on 
the same day mainland americans pick a new president but an 
underlining issue here is the seemingly neverending debate over 
the islands 36yearold commonwealth relationship with the united 
states 
puerto ricos three main political parties distinguished from 
each other primarily by their support for commonwealth statehood 
or independence all are seeking changes in what some of them see 
as the islands semicolonial status 
the outcome of elections here nov 8 is likely to hinge more on 
personalities and issues such as unemployment than on puerto ricos 
political status analysts say 
but both incumbent governor rafael hernandez colon the 
commonwealth candidate and his statehood rival mayor baltasar 
corrada del rio of san juan have pledged to hold a status 
referendum after the election 
the issue has featured prominently in the campaign so far 
it would be the first such referendum since 1967 when 60 
percent of the voters favored a continuation of the commonwealth 
arrangement 39 percent statehood and 1 percent independence 
puerto rico an island of 33 million mostly spanishspeaking 
people 1000 miles southeast of miami has flown the us flag 
since 1898 when spain ceded it to the united states at the end of 
the spanishamerican war 
the modernday commonwealth arrangement which went into effect 
in july 1952 gives puerto rico roughly as much control over its 
own affairs as any of the 50 states 
puerto ricans are us citizens but they pay no us taxes and 
cannot vote for president nevertheless they are eligible for us 
military service and social security and welfare benefits 
puerto rico receives substantial us aid 65 billion this 
year alone and us companies taking advantage of tax 
exemptions have given the island one of the strongest economies in 
latin america 
in return the united states uses puerto rico as a strategic 
base for naval operations and an important market for us goods 
the reality of the relationship as it is now 
procommonwealth commentator alex w maldonado wrote in the 
englishlanguage san juan star is enormously beneficial to 
puerto rico despite monumental efforts of president reagan and 
congress to cut domestic spending to reduce the gigantic federal 
deficit the flow of funds to the island has continued to grow 
yet there is dissatisfaction on all sides commonwealth 
supporters want more say in running the island statehooders 
complain of being treated as secondclass citizens and the 
independence movement fervently at times violently seeks 
undiluted puerto rican sovereignty 
hernandez colon 51 who is seeking his third fouryear term 
favors continued commonwealth status but wants washington to 
relinquish control over immigration foreign trade and certain 
environmental and labor matters 
his popular democratic party has announced plans for a 
referendum sometime after the election seeking maximum autonomy 
for puerto rico but the party has not specified what the term 
means 
corrada del rios new progressive party which wants puerto rico 
to become the 51st us state says its referendum would ask voters 
whether puerto rico should begin negotiations with the united 
states on statehood if approved the referendum would be followed 
by a second vote on any negotiated formula 
the tiny independence party which hasnt won more than 6 
percent of the vote in 20 years proposes an election of a 
multiparty assembly to resolve the sovereignty question and 
negotiate a solution with washington 
regardless of the outcome the election is unlikely to resolve 
the status issue the statehood party has twice held the governors 
office since it was founded in 1967 but has made no effort to 
achieve statehood while in power 
hernandez colon who has stressed his administrations economic 
record rather than the status issue is favored to win but it 
could be close 
an opinion poll of 600 registered voters carried out for san 
juans channel 2 television station in july put the incumbent 
governor 5 points ahead of corrada del rio 45 percent to 40 
percent with 4 percent backing the independence partys ruben 
berrios and the rest undecided the poll had a margin of error of 
plus or minus 43 percent

fiveyearold sergio neal was lucky to 
survive a fire that destroyed the small apartment where he lived 
with his mother and two sisters 
and he was fortunate to receive prompt expert care to treat 
second and thirddegree burns over most of his face his hands and 
chest and part of his arms and head 
but sergio featured recently in a newsweek article looking at 
the tragic ramifications of living in poverty is still very much 
in need 
his face was pitifully disfigured by the flames and he has not 
regained full movement of his hands 
he and his 2yearold sister shakeriay who was not as 
seriously injured spent a month at a shriners burn institute in 
cincinnati ohio after the december incident in this rural orlando 
suburb just a few miles down the road from walt disney world 
the newsweek story last month prompted offers of assistance from 
around the country some for medical care and reconstructive 
surgery a volunteer organization in apopka has set up a 
fundraising account for the neals 
a 6yearold girl from new jersey sent newsweek a letter 
containing two 1 bills and two nickels with a note saying would 
you please give this to sergio 
the fire started after the childrens mother audrey neal 
stepped out briefly to a neighboring apartment leaving sergio and 
shakeriay in the living room one of them evidently played with a 
cigarette lighter and fire quickly engulfed the small apartment 
wouldbe rescuers found one of the doors to the apartment 
boarded up they could not get the knob on the other door to work 
hearing the childrens screams and frantic fruitless efforts to 
open the front door ms neal and neighbors finally broke through 
the door fought the flames and carried the children out just as 
firefighters arrived rescue workers administered emergency medical 
treatment and rushed them to an orlando hospital 
a day after the blaze sergio and his sister were flown in 
separate learjet ambulances complete with a doctor nurse and 
medical technician in each plane from orlando to the shrine 
facility in cincinnati 
after their months stay sergio has continued to get outpatient 
care two or three times a month all of this expensive 
sophisticated treatment has been provided free by the shriners 
under their generous programs for needy burned and crippled 
children around the country 
still until sergio gets older there is little doctors can do 
about his scarred and pitted face 
much of the reconstructive surgery has to wait until bone 
growth stops probably around the age of 16 says victor clark 
childrens director of the bahia shrine temple in orlando who 
arranged for the neals treatment transportation and continuing 
visits to the cincinnati facility 
but were prepared to help him as long as he needs it up to 
the age of 21 says clark 
while sergios continuing medical treatment for his physical 
injuries is ensured there is some worry about his other 
notsoobvious problems and needs the mental anguish which is 
difficult to determine in a young child his education and the 
home care necessary before plastic surgery 
he now wears a plastic face mask which clark says puts pressure 
on facial scar tissue to make it grow sideways to decrease its 
thickness 
because of his facial disfigurement his mother is keeping him 
out of school and hopes to get him on a program that provides a 
visiting teacher for homebound students 
so while other kids his age are starting school sergio is 
spending hours in front of a tv or playing and squabbling with his 
two sisters and four cousins in the twobedroom apartment where 
they now live 
sergios mother and her three children moved in with her sister 
shawana and her four kids after the fire 
the basic problem is that they are so poor they have no 
resources for anything says social activist cathy moore about 
the neal family 
for one thing here are seven children and two adults living 
in a tiny apartment and now the landlord has given them an 
eviction notice 
ms moore director of a volunteer organization known as smile 
for single mothers in a learning experience said audrey neals 
family would like to move out but cant afford to do so 
sergios mother gets less than 350 a month in afdc the 
states aid to families with dependent children ms moore said 
whereas shed need an annual income of 15000 to qualify under a 
federally subsidized lowincome housing program 
ms moore set up the fundraising account for the neals to help 
them with housing and home health care and education for sergio 
meanwhile winter park attorney russell troutman one of the 
founders of a legalaid office for the poor in the apopka area 
said he was looking into the possibility of a liability lawsuit 
over the allegedly defective doorknob in the neal apartment 
as i understand it the kiddies were trying their best to open 
the door during the fire but the doorknob wouldnt work he said 
were looking into it 
the sergio neal case is just one example of how people tend to 
overlook those in need until disaster strikes ms moore said 
adding that articles like the one in newsweek just scratch the 
surface of the problem 
i hope we realize poverty is all around us she said that 
its not always something hidden behind the scenes

former president jimmy carter is rallying other 
nations heads of state and health officials to eradicate a 
debilitating disease that infects 10 million people and disrupts 
agriculture in the third world 
carter has also persuaded the world health organization to 
target guinea worm disease which sometimes has fatal 
complications as the second disease after smallpox that the 
agency seeks to wipe out worldwide 
he became concerned about the readily preventable disease 
through a famine relief program sponsored by global 2000 a public 
health foundation headquartered at the carter presidential center 
in atlanta 
the program whose primary goal is to improve yield for farmers 
crops found that agriculture in many remote areas was hampered 
because the cyclical worm disease strikes so many people in the 
spring sickening them at planting season 
the disease itself is sickening to describe in spring infected 
people find the worm a yardlong stringlike creature painfully 
emerging from boils that form in soft tissue between the toes or 
elsewhere on the body having completed its growth cycle inside its 
human host it enters the body through contaminated water 
seeing the ailments devastation is heartrending carter 
said in a telephone interview from his home in plains and just 
to realize that with a simple education program and very simple 
prevention techiques this affliction could be eliminated forever 
last spring he and his wife rosalynn visited heavily infected 
villages in the west african nation of ghana the first village 
we went to had a population of 500 and they had 213 people 
stretched out on the ground under the kasha trees for us just to 
see and to meet carter said 
when we talked to the village elders and chiefs they didnt 
have any idea what caused guinea worm they thought it might come 
from the praying mantis or from drinking the blood of goats or from 
some superstition like the confluence of the planets or that it was 
a punishment of the gods to test their endurance he said 
they didnt have any idea it came from drinking filthy water 
then we went down to look at the water hole that was their only 
source of drinking water it was covered with scum and the people 
had to wade out id say at least knee deep before they could get a 
bucket full of water he said 
some of the waders were infected and entered the water to ease 
their pain 
when the emerging guinea worm comes in contact with water it 
spews out its larvae which are then eaten by a microscopic animal 
called a cyclops 
villagers drink the water contaminated with cyclops and the 
cyclops die in their bodies leaving behind the larvae to grow into 
worms infections caused when the worm dies inside the body can be 
fatal though that is rare carter said 
in the first worm eradication program undertaken by global 2000 
in pakistan foundation workers developed inexpensive techniques 
for breaking the creatures 12month life cycle 
carter said the infestations can be prevented by replacing water 
holes with deep wells but that costs 700 or 800 and we dont 
have 700 or 800 for every village in africa 
other preventive measures include keeping people out of the 
water holes or having all villagers strain their water for a full 
year but widespread illiteracy makes it difficult to educate the 
people at risk 
still with the support and participation of the pakistani 
government global 2000s eradication program is going so well that 
carter predicted the disease would be eliminated there by 1990 
fullscale programs have started in ghana and nigeria in the 
last year and a new program is about to begin in uganda 
one of the things that i can contribute as a former president 
is to go not to an assistant minister of health who may not have 
much influence or may not know anything about health to start with 
but i go directly to the king or the president or the prime 
minister and ask him to bring his cabinet members together 
carter said 
the news media attention his involvement receives also helps 
educate potential victims about the disease 
its a gratifying thing to see a village that was formerly 
devastated five or six months a year from guinea worm to emerge 
after a couple of years with no guinea worm and live a happy 
prosperous and healthy life carter said 
in the process to be frank about it it puts america forward 
as an enlightened concerned and peaceloving nation

vice president george bush and gov michael 
dukakis have issued matching promises of accessibility to the white 
house press but neither was saying how often he would hold formal 
presidential news conferences 
the rival presidential nominees made their statements on news 
and information policies in written responses to inquiries by the 
freedom of information committee of the associated press managing 
editors association 
their replies were made public as apme officers and committee 
chairmen met in new york on monday 
i hope words like accessible candid honest and fair 
will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media 
by historians republican bush said it certainly is what i 
will strive for during my tenure as president 
the reagan administration has come under frequent criticism for 
limiting access to information 
dukakis renewed that criticism the democratic nominee prefaced 
his comments on his plans with a charge that the reaganbush 
administration has waged an assault on the freedom of information 
act with every weapon in its arsenal 
dukakis said he has a proven record of accessibility to 
reporters and would continue on that course as president 
throughout my public career ive believed in a free press and 
my record shows ive practiced that belief he said as 
president i would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility 
to the white house press corps giving them and me the opportunity 
to utilize our first amendment freedoms 
a questionnaire prepared for the foi committee was given to both 
candidates bush responded directly answering each of the 
questions dukakis replied by issuing a twopart position paper 
with one section on the freedom of information law and a second on 
his press relations 
here is a partial transcript of their replies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q as president what sort of tone would you set regarding 
openness in government access to government information and 
freedom of information 
a within the limits of national security government should be 
open to scrutiny by the media and the public ours is a democracy 
where goverment must be accountable to the people the 
informationgathering process from a news conference to the 
freedom of information act is vital and essential to our system of 
democracy 
q what kind of relationship do you think youve had with the 
media during your public career how would you seek to improve it 
if at all 
a i think i have had a good relationship with the media as 
president i hope that i will be able to spend more time talking 
with smaller groups of reporters i enjoy a good give and take and 
that kind of format allows me to get to know reporters a little 
better and them to know me not only will this benefit reporters 
but more importantly such free exchange will ultimately benefit 
the general public as well 
q throughout history presidents have had a variety of 
relationships with the media are there any styles you would 
emulate are there any you would avoid when it comes time to write 
the history of your relations with the media what will it say 
a with the media the congress or the public it would be a 
mistake to attempt to be something or someone youre not so warts 
and all what you see is what youll get 
i hope words like accessible candid honest and 
fair will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with 
the media by historians it certainly is what i will strive for 
during my tenure as president 
q how frequently would you meet with reporters how would you 
conduct press conferences how often would you hold press 
conferences would you make any changes in the way president reagan 
has done his press conferences 
a there are a number of ways to communicate with both the media 
and the public press conferences are one important way and they 
would certainly be central to my effort to ensure accessibility in 
my administration oneonone and group interviews satellite 
interviews with regional media national televised addresses are 
other examples of methods that a president can and should use to 
provide the media with opportunities to discuss administration 
policies and programs 
my goal would be to get the right mix of all of the options 
available to guarantee an open administration realistically you 
cant put a number on any of the working parts of an open approach 
to accessibility but you can make and keep a commitment to the 
goal itself 
q more specifically what message will you send to your 
executive agencies regarding freedom of information requests 
a my message will be simple obey the law 
q heres a chance to offer some contructive criticism what 
things would you most like to change about the news media what 
should the nations media do differently to better serve the public 
interest 
a accuracy and fairness are the name of the game the media 
goes to great lengths to be accurate it needs to go to the same 
lengths to be fair while it is often necessary to use unnamed 
sources in gathering information for a story it puts the validity 
of a story at a disadvantage i hope the news media would rely as 
little as possible on this approach to information gathering and 
reporting

q what sort of individual do you see putting in the job of 
white house spokesperson how much access would the spokesman have 
to administration thinking and information do you condone larry 
speakes practice of manufacturing quotes 
a the job of white house press secretary is one of the toughest 
in any administration and a number of qualities are important a 
press secretary must be honest ethical steady candid with both 
the media and the president and experienced with an understanding 
of the media and its needs a sense of humor doesnt hurt either 
if access is important to reporters it is absolutely vital to a 
press secretary i understand that to function effectively a 
press secretary must have a firsthand knowledge of a presidents 
policies and positions 
finally on the third question no 
q how much access do you believe reporters ought to have to the 
white house staff how free would your staff be to talk on the 
record to reporters 
a the bush administration will be an open one that doesnt 
mean every staff member will be authorized to serve as an 
administration spokesman or interpreter of events and policies the 
best interests of the government media and public arent observed 
by the confusion and misinformation that usually results from that 
kind of policy 
not in every instance but in most if something cant be said on 
the record its probably better left unsaid 
q what would be your policy on allowing media coverage of 
military actions a la grenada do you support the pool approach 
worked out and used in the persian gulf exercises or do you 
believe reporters and photographers ought to have even freer access 
to military operations 
a certainly the public has a right to know the details of 
military operations in an appropriate time frame and in a way that 
does not risk national security the current relationship between 
the military and the press is workable and i support it but that 
safety of the troops and the success of the mission must be 
paramount and i will risk neither

freedom of information for the past eight years the 
reaganbush administration has waged an assault on the freedom of 
information act foia with every weapon in its arsenal executive 
orders budget cuts fee guidelines and legislative proposals 
their objective is clear to gut a statute whose fundamental 
premise is that american citizens have the right to know about the 
activities of their own government 
the current administration claims that complying with the foia 
is too timeconsuming too expensive and too bothersome these are 
excuses for government secrecy and they could serve as a cloak for 
incompetence mismanagement illegality or corruption 
as president i will implement the foia in the spirit which 
congress intended from vietnam to watergate to irancontra we 
americans have learned what happens when government operates in 
secrecy accountable to no one a dukakis administration will treat 
requesters of information as clients not as burdens for only in 
an atmosphere of the fullest possible disclosure can the american 
people retain confidence in their government 
relations with the press throughout my public career ive 
believed in a free press and my record shows ive practiced that 
belief as governor for nearly 10 years i have been accessible to 
state house reporters several times a week i enjoy the spirited 
give and take of news conferences and the vigorous exchange of an 
interview more important i understand and appreciate the role of 
the news media in a free society as laid out two centuries ago in 
the bill of rights to the constitution 
as president i would hope to continue this pattern of 
accessibility to the white house press corps giving them and me 
the opportunity to utilize our first amendment freedoms

investors may be dissatisfied with the progress 
of stock prices lately but they should be pleased with rising 
dividends 
thats the case being argued these days by analysts who argue 
that the boring stock market of 1988 has actually produced more 
generous rewards than its notices would suggest 
when standard amp poors corp estimated recently that 
corporations might increase their dividends by as much as 10 
percent this year little loud cheering was heard on wall street 
dividends provide half the total return earned by common 
stocks historically yet wall street traditionally ignores them 
observed paul kuper executive vice president at the centre square 
investment group in philadelphia 
but watch out wall street dividends and more particularly 
dividend growth are likely to take a front seat with investors as 
the 5 to 6percent growth rate of the last five years doubles to 
10 to 12percent over the next few years 
it isnt hard to figure out why dividends didnt command as much 
attention as capital gains when the typical investor thought about 
the stock market in recent years 
if you tried to talk about dividends in the heady 198287 bull 
market you most likely would have been laughed out of the room 
and in the subsequent crash last fall the furthest thing from 
anybodys mind was a quarterly dividend check 
in any financial season most professional money managers and 
brokers arent paid by their clients to generate dividends 
however analysts who have delved into the subject say that to 
dismiss dividends as irrelevant misses the point 
we have always considered yield to be a bedrock indicator of 
value asserts john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc 
it is a hard number unlike earnings or book value which may 
exist only in the mind of an accountant 
declaring a dividend involves a cash payment it is not a 
decision that is taken lightly 
the dividend bulls base their optimism on several factors 
starting with the strong trend in corporate earnings that helps 
give boards of directors the option of voting dividend increases 
furthermore says kuper at centre square companies recently 
have been paying out less than 40 percent of their earnings as 
dividends which is close to a historic low a normal rate he 
says is more like 50 percent 
the tax reform act of 1986 he adds provided a spur to 
dividends since it eliminated the special tax treatment of 
longterm capital gains that means that dividends now have an 
equal value with capital gains for taxpaying investors 
based on his estimates for 1989 connolly figures the aggregate 
yield on the standard amp poors composite index of 500 stocks 
projects to 41 percent 
contrast that with the mere 26 percent available at the 
market top last year he says 
these numbers are unlikely to make anyones adrenaline flow 
he acknowledges stocks are bought for appreciation not yield 
but we are more interested in value than pizzazz at this 
stage and 41 percent is a comfortable number 
for the first twothirds of 1988 connolly adds the sampp 500 was 
up about 7 percent since the yield is about 4 percent total 
return is 11 percent 
this compares well with the 10 percent annual longterm 
return on stocks boring might not be so bad

for stephen collins who aspires to be a 
character actor but finds himself in a leading mans body nick 
tattinger might just be the perfect role 
nick the hero of nbcs new tattingers is a twofisted 
upfromthestreets entrepreneur who has become one of the swells 
by virtue of owning an exclusive manhattan restaurant hes a 
goodlooking charming guy but hes also quite a character 
the show filmed on location in new york premieres oct 26 
over lunch at a midtown indian restaurant collins 41 said 
that until recently he would not have been the man for the part in 
fact he said unbeknownst to him he was rejected for it when the 
shows cocreator bruce paltrow was first kicking around the idea 
a few years ago 
evidently at the time i had no idea my name came up and he 
said no hes too young and hes not right for it hes not what 
were looking for at all collins said 
but more recently after attending a cocktail party at the home 
of his friend blythe danner who happens to be paltrows wife 
collins got a call from paltrow 
he said im sending you this script because my wife thinks 
that you can play the central character blythe had not said a 
word to me what blythe had i guess said to him was hes a 
little older and hes a little rougher around the edges and i 
think hed be interested in playing this part i read it and 
immediately knew 
danner costars in the series as nicks socialite exwife 
hillary 
ive done a few things im proud of not enough but ive 
done a few things im proud of said collins and the common 
denominator of all of them is that when i read the script its 
like i can visualize the character but i dont get all 
involved in the image of what the character is and its usually a 
character part nick is really a character part it wont look like 
that to a lot of people because im playing it and people have me 
tagged 
to illustrate the kind of guy nick is collins opens a script 
and turns to a scene between nick and norman simon jones 
hillarys lover nick says norman is a better father than he is a 
good person 
nick doesnt see himself as a very good person collins 
said and hes not in a lot of ways norman says thats not 
enough nick says its gotta be norm says oh sure you can 
say that looking like you do but what about the rest of us with 
thinning hair and baggy eyes nick says everybody thinks my life 
is so fabulous let me tell you something being back in new york 
surrounded by the facts all i see is what i lost what i threw 
away getting it back in tiny pieces here and there stinks then 
he says you hear violins 
thats the way he feels about his life its like hes really 
come to a crisis point in this life its really fun to play 
someone who doesnt have all the answers 
collins who was born in iowa but grew up in and around new york 
city has always been pegged as a leadingman type he works often 
on the stage and has just written his first play 
his film credits can almost be divided down the line between 
small parts in good pictures such as all the presidents men 
and between the lines and bigger parts in sillier if 
commercially successful movies like star trek the motion 
picture and brewsters millions 
he is a frequent presence in tv movies and miniseries and got a 
1987 emmy nomination for his supporting role as annmargrets cad 
husband in the two mrs grenvilles 
collins occasionally brushing back his longish blond hair says 
when he considers it objectively he has to conclude that his looks 
have helped as much as hurt his career 
i think everybody however they look they take their looks 
for granted so its not news to me if people see me that way he 
said and so what i remember as an actor is the number of times 
people have said to me literally oh you gave the best reading 
we thought yours was the best reading but we need somebody whos 
not a leadingman type for this part we need somebody with more 
character thats part of the reason its so much fun to play this 
part because you need a little of both to play nick

as the first anniversary of the stock market 
crash approaches some economists are advancing a new explanation 
for the 500 billion jolt animal spirits 
animal spirits is a shorthand phrase for emotion unreason 
and other qualities that to be fair to animals are really more 
typical of human beings than the lower beasts 
most people have figured all along that emotion affects the 
stock market but for economists to say the same thing amounts to a 
major shift 
economists were indoctrinated to believe that financial markets 
adjust quickly and smoothly to changes in the rational expectations 
of investors at any given moment in other words stock prices 
reflect the perfect collective wisdom of millions of investors 
there were some doubts about the socalled efficient markets 
theory even before black monday there were a lot afterward after 
all nothing happened in the real world on oct 19 to reduce the 
true value of corporate america by nearly a quarter which is how 
much stocks fell that day 
thats where animal spirits come in or fads or secular 
bubbles depending on which economist is coining slogans 
evidence has accumulated that the oct 19 stock crash was in 
large part the result of portfolio insurance a computerized 
strategy that triggers avalanches by dumping more and more stocks 
the further they fall 
emotion played a small part that day because many of the 
supposedly emotional small investors either sat tight or couldnt 
get their sell orders through 
still animal spirits and crowd psychology help explain why 
investors bid stocks up so unreasonably high in the first place 
setting themselves up for a fall 
stock prices are supposed to go up when the economy is doing 
well reflecting the outlook for rising corporate profits but the 
relation is so haphazard that one economist has even been able to 
conclude the opposite that stocks and bonds do best when the 
economy is doing worst 
stock market rallies start in the middle of recessions said 
aubrey zaffuto an economist at ibj schroder bank amp trust co 
ms zaffuto theorizes that when the economy slows down there is 
unused money sloshing around that is parked in financial assets 
driving up their value 
the badisgood view is disputed by most economists but the 
fact that it even exists shows the weakness of the correlation 
between stocks and the real world 
i dont want to go so far as to say theres no connection 
between the stock market and the economy but what that 
connection is remains in dispute said john campbell an 
economist at princeton university 
campbell is more sympathetic to the efficient markets theorists 
than some of his colleagues such as yale universitys robert 
shiller and harvard universitys gregory mankiw who lean toward 
the faddist school 
but he said to tell you the truth im a little puzzled 
for a while academics at least believed you could explain all 
movements in the stock market by expectations of future dividends 
perhaps adjusted a bit for real interest rates 
people have become more humble thats progress of a kind but 
its not much progress toward a solution

new standards set by the us government for a 
future highquality television system may give the american 
electronics industry a chance to catch up with japanese and 
european makers but the result could be three separate world tv 
broadcast standards officials and analysts say 
the united states has lagged behind europe and japan in 
development of highdefinition television a new widescreen tv 
system with breathtakingly detailed pictures and highquality sound 
that represents the biggest change in television since color 
broadcasting 
on sept 1 the us federal communications commission set 
initial standards for future hdtv broadcasts in the united states 
that are incompatible with those developed in europe and japan 
this past week in the united states rep edward j markey 
dmass asked electronics industry trade groups to submit reports 
to congress by january outlining steps the government could take to 
ensure american involvement in highdefinition tv 
this is the last moment of opportunity for the united states 
to remain a major party in the world consumer electronics 
industry said john stern representative in japan of the two 
largest us electronics trade organizations 
in japan broadcasts using an hdtv system developed by the nhk 
public television network are scheduled to begin in two years 
while european companies are expected to launch sales of equipment 
for a separate european hdtv system in 1992 officials say in both 
regions hdtv broadcasts will be beamed direct from satellites to 
small receiving dishes in viewers homes 
the outcome of the battle among hdtv systems for the worlds 
living rooms analysts say could help determine what country will 
dominate the global electronics industry 
at stake are potential hdtv sales estimated by japans nhk at 
80 billion by 1995 but the actual cost could be much greater if 
companies and countries miss out on hdtv production as most 
us electronics makers have with videocassette recorders compact 
disk players and other consumer products 
the us manufacturing industry is worried that hdtv will open 
an enormous new market to japanese companies stern said its 
not just a matter of television but also medical and military 
imaging publishing and computer digital imageprocessing 
equipment its all the same technology 
the united states is about six years behind japan in the 
commercialization of hdtv technology stern says and the new 
preliminary fcc standards will provide it with an extra one year 
maximum to catch up incompatibility with japanese and european 
standards means manufacturers have to design separate equipment for 
the us market 
in europe manufacturers were able to develop their hdtv system 
in about two years but unlike those in the united states european 
companies have remained strong in consumer electronics 
hdtv development began in the 1960s when engineers at nhk 
started developing a stateoftheart system they hoped would unify 
the worlds tv systems into a single standard 
but at international talks on adopting the nhk system as a world 
standard in 1986 the europeans opposed the japanese hdtv broadcast 
standard because of its incompatibility with current television 
equipment 
that lack of compatibility would force consumers and 
broadcasters to replace their current equipment estimated to be 
worth about 100 billion in the united states according to a 
recent congressional budget office report if they want to receive 
hdtv broadcasts 
according to the new fcc standards future hdtv broadcasts in 
the united states must use current tv channels and be viewable on 
present televisions however to see the improved picture quality 
consumers would need to buy new receivers just as color tv sets 
are needed now to see broadcasts in color while old 
blackandwhite televisions can receive the same broadcasts in 
monochrome 
nhk officials say they decided to give up compatibility with 
current tv equipment because of the technical limitations of 
present systems developed decades ago 
since the 1986 meeting european companies have developed a 
separate hdtv system that is viewable although with unenhanced 
picture quality on current european televisions but not on those 
in other parts of the world 
the new fcc standards are a good decision said maurice 
bourene attache for science and technology at the european 
communitys mission in japan its a chance for the united states 
to stimulate its own industry 
but bourene said the us decision almost definitely means 
there will be three separate world hdtv broadcast standards 
its better if we keep our own european system because its 
a small protection against the japanese industry even if the 
japanese develop equipment for the european market very quickly 
they will need a license and its not clear that they can get it 
so it may be possible for european makers to keep hold of the 
european market he said

japanese industry officials say they already have perfected 
technologies that will meet the fcc standards 
the technology already exists and japanese companies should 
be able to begin production of equipment without much trouble 
said takeo kumasaka of japans hivision center an organization 
created in part by the ministry of international trade and industry 
to encourage development of japanese hdtv 
where were they critics of the japanese system while we were 
spending more than 50 million to develop equipment for hdtv 
asked a official at japans sony corp if they had suggestions 
why didnt they make them earlier 
but while debate continues on the details of a final us hdtv 
broadcast standard japans nhk system may become a studio and 
production standard at least in some applications 
already film makers in north america and japan are using the 
nhk system to produce movies because of its advantages over film in 
speed ease of editing and adaptibility to special effects 
soon japanese hdtv videocassette recorders and prerecorded 
tapes are likely to be available and cable broadcasts may follow 
studio standards have nothing to do with the fcc so the fcc 
ruling wont affect negotiations on a possible world production 
standard for hdtv nhks takehiko motohashi said therefore 
the fcc ruling wont necessarily affect the exchange between 
countries of hdtv television programs 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the securities and exchange commission in a longawaited move 
filed extensive civil insidertrading fraud and stock manipulation 
charges against the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
michael milken the head of its junk bond trading unit and others 
all defendants denied the charges which stemmed from an 
investigation tied to convicted stock speculator ivan boesky 
in a similar case stephen suikuan wang jr a former morgan 
stanley amp co rookie analyst pleaded guilty to the first criminal 
charges stemming from what the government has called the second 
largest insider trading case in wall street history and william 
dillon a fired merrill lynch amp co stockbroker pleaded guilty to 
fraud after admitting he traded securities based on advance 
knowledge of stocktouting columns in business week magazine 
the senate approved new limits on imports of textiles clothing 
and shoes defying the threat of a veto just weeks before november

the labor department said its producer price index for finished 
goods rose a seasonally adjusted 06 percent last month the

the government reported that the nations commercial banks 
earned 105 billion in the first and second quarters of this year

after a sleepy august that saw record low sales 
volume the municipal bond market has picked up steam 
trading in bonds issued by state and local governments normally 
revives with the coming of autumn after the summer doldrums but 
the muni market also is getting a lift from the recent robust 
rally in bond prices in general touched off sept 2 by government 
economic reports signaling a slowdown in the economy and suggesting 
an easing of inflation 
the bond rally has again lured to municipals many investors who 
were soured on the stock market by last octobers crash 
as bond prices have risen they have pushed interest rates 
lower the yield on highlyrated municipal issues is now averaging 
around 798 percent down from 810 percent on sept 1 the day 
before the economic reports were released 
if municipal yields keep falling to a target level of around 
740 percent to 750 percent a flood of new issues could be 
brought to market some analysts believe 
its a return to more traditional pulses said william fish 
a senior vice president of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities 
corp 
the pickup in activity is a welcome relief to market players 
after the dog days of august when sales of longterm municipal 
bonds nationwide dropped to around 551 billion the lowest 
monthly total in 2 years muni sales hadnt been that skimpy since 
february 1986 when only 318 billion of the bonds changed hands 
sales normally run around 8 billion a month 
the september revival is reflected in the volume of new munis 
scheduled to hit the market this coming week for example several 
big issues are planned from illinois 175 million ohio 155 
million washington state 50 million the new york state 
mortgage agency 450 million montgomery county md 50 
million and the metropolitan seattle sewer district 48 million 
but in addition to scheduled issues theres a shadow 
calendar of new munis thats also expected to swell this month 
in those instances the state or local entity issuing the bonds 
waits for interest rates to fall or to see how other muni issues 
are received by the market 
if conditions are right the issuers emerge from the shadows 
we then tend to have a minirush to market said neal 
attermann vice president and municipal research director of kidder 
peabody amp co 
especially sensitive to interestrate declines are negotiated 
municipal issues in which the issuer and an underwriter negotiate 
with each other and reach agreement on the terms of the issue they 
are more hidden from the market than competitive issues where the 
issuer accepts bids from several underwriters seeking to finance 
the issue 
because negotiated issues are more confidential their sponsors 
can easily keep them hidden on the shadow calendar until they 
feel the time is right around 60 percent to 70 percent of all 
municipal issues are negotiated according to analysts 
this month negotiated issues could come out of the 
woodwork said fish of donaldson lufkin

when wall street has its monthly confrontation 
with the governments trade statistics next wednesday a new wild 
card will be added to the game 
the commerce department is adopting a new format for reporting 
the figures and analysts say it may create more than the usual 
confusion in the financial markets 
along with a number comparable to those of past months the 
department will calculate the nations trade deficit excluding the 
cost of freight and insurance for imports 
this socalled customs value method of figuring the balance 
between imports and exports typically produces a deficit total 
about 15 billion lower than otherwise analysts note 
previously the customs value trade balance had been reported at 
least two days later than the original unadjusted figure and 
commanded almost no attention from stock and bond investors 
now says maury harris economist at painewebber it is likely 
that administration spokespersons will be emphasizing the lower 
customs value deficit 
as charles taylor at prudentialbache securities asserted the 
july merchandise trade deficit will be about 15 billion lower 
than it otherwise would be 
but this is a cosmetic improvement only the currentaccount 
deficit and therefore the dollarfinancing requirement of the 
united states will not be affected one iota 
some say that kind of assessment is too harsh after all they 
say the subject of the data is the merchandise trade deficit 
and insurance and freight are not merchandise but services instead 
commerce department officials have said that the change in 
procedure which was mandated by the trade bill enacted in august 
is intended to put proper emphasis on those numbers that most 
accurately depict the situation 
still wall street analysts say it may well introduce a new 
element of uncertainty to markets that are highly sensitive to 
economic statistics like the trade data 
two different numbers on the same day will initially generate 
some temporary confusion and possible cynicism about government 
tampering with statistics before elections said harris 
amid the uncertainty pervading wall street the stock market was 
able to scratch out some modest gains in the past week though they 
did not live up to hopes built up in a rally begun just before the 
labor day weekend 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 1422 points to 
206881 
the new york stock exchange composite index chimed in with a 
118 advance to 15084 the american stock exchange market value 
index rose 183 to 29745 and the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market added 509 to 38160 
volume on the big board averaged 13517 million shares a day 
against 12848 million the week before 
when the trade figures are sorted out what are they likely to 
show nothing worthy of any big fuss a cynical observer might say 
since like most monthly data they provide no reliable evidence of 
the kind of trend that would concern any savvy longterm investor 
that complaint aside the data are not expected to provide much 
news to revive traders flagging spirits 
says the merrill lynch market letter in its preview of the 
report after improving on a fairly steady basis earlier in the 
year the foreign trade deficit had a relapse in june climbing to 
125 billion from 98 billion in may the deficit probably wont 
improve much in coming months 
the comparable figure for july will probably come in around 
105 billion merrill lynch analysts say

after black monday the last thing wall street 
needs is another crisis of confidence 
but the governments massive fraud accusations against 
investment giant drexel burnham lambert inc threaten to rock the 
publics already shaky trust in the fairness of the stock market 
by refocusing the 2yearold insider trading investigation on a 
major securities firm the charges leveled by the securities and 
exchange commission elevated the scandal well beyond the simple 
greed of individuals like ivan boesky and dennis levine 
in so doing the government heightened public doubts about the 
venerable institutions that control the securities business and 
shape the markets role in the american economy 
although many investment professionals think the move against 
drexel by the sec reflects an aggressive government effort to make 
the markets fairer others say that at least for now the charges 
are likely to further erode ordinary americans confidence in 
stocks and other securities 
that could mean less business for brokers less longterm 
investing more difficulty for companies trying to raise money to 
grow rising unemployment mounting debt and a fall in americas 
economic might some strategists argue 
theres no question this comes at a bad time said perrin 
long a securities industry expert at lipper analytical securities 
corp in new york it probably lowers confidence as far as the 
average investor is concerned below what their alreadylow 
confidence may be 
although long and others said they believe the securities 
industry in general and drexel in particular will ultimately 
survive the sad thing is if wall street doesnt prosper its 
highly unlikely the country will prosper theres a close tiein 
all the way around and it benefits both not to have our image 
tarnished its a sad situation 
the staggering civil suit filed by the sec last wednesday 
against drexel and key employees notably its highyield 
highrisk junk bond unit chief michael milken accused them of 
a vast array of frauds ranging from insider trading to stock 
manipulation to clientcheating 
the defendants denied the charges vowed to vigorously fight 
them in court and predicted vindication 
as outlined by the sec drexel engaged in systematic arrogant 
abuse of its position as a leading investment firm calling into 
question why it is in business in the first place 
i would say this particular news story or incident isnt 
helpful in terms of bringing the small investor back said 
william gross managing director of pacific investment management 
co of newport beach calif which manages a 17 billion portfolio 
for large institutional clients such as pension funds 
the more headlines you see on trials about insider trading 
im not commenting on the veracity of this suit the more the 
individual investor subscribes to the theory that you cant win 
gross said 
the sec action had been expected for months and both the stock 
and bond markets showed little outward reaction but it raised the 
likelihood that the manhattan us attorneys office will soon 
bring criminal charges which would be far more serious and could 
possibly cripple drexels ability to do business 
the firms difficult position also recalls the demise of ef 
hutton group inc the oncemighty retail brokerage devastated by 
fraud charges that arose from a checkkiting scandal three years 
ago a debilitated hutton was sold to shearson lehman brothers inc 
last year 
this analogy hasnt been lost on drexel which has undertaken an 
unprecedented television campaign for support stressing what it 
calls the firms role in raising money for projects ranging from 
daycare centers to middleincome housing 
but the sec move and possible criminal charges may nullify the 
effect of that campaign they also are bound to incite a spree of 
suits from investors who claim they lost money on stocks allegedly 
manipulated by drexel and other defendants 
there are two levels of awareness in the marketplace you 
have the professionals close to the industry who were aware this 
was there and when it happens its a nonevent said john w 
bachmann chairman of the securities industry association then 
there are the people who heard it along the way and werent aware 
and in that group its not a plus 
some say the combined effects of all the litigation and 
publicity already have made drexel a tainted household word much 
in the same way that boesky the speculatorfelon who led 
authorities to the investment firm became synonymous with wall 
street insider trading a few years ago 
john markese vice president and research director for the 
american association of individual investors in chicago said he 
believed the drexel story and other accounts of alleged securities 
fraud likely would help drive customers away from retail 
stockbrokers and into large mutual funds which have greater 
diversity and strength 
but ultimately he said the federal crackdown on wall street 
excesses probably would help many investors regain some degree of 
assurance that the markets arent totally rigged regardless of 
whether drexel exonerates itself 
the small investor is always at the bottom of the information 
ladder that has always been true and cases like this point up how 
tall that ladder is markese said i think the sec is trying to 
make it a shorter and quicker information flow so thats all 
good
