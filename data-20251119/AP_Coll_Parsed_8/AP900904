an irish man imprisoned here for seven years in 
an immigration dispute testified tuesday that hes quit the irish 
republican army and would abide by all bail conditions if released 
joseph doherty 35 faces a life sentence in the united kingdom 
for the 1980 slaying of a british officer doherty escaped from a 
belfast prison in 1981 and fled to the united states on the orders 
of an ira superior he was captured here in 1983 and has been held 
in a manhattan jail since 
at a bail hearing doherty said he would return to the united 
kingdom if his bid for political asylum in the united states fails 
if i were to go back to face the hangmans rope i would go 
back doherty said during four hours of testimony i would pay 
my own ticket and gladly go back go back graciously on that plane 
with no malice to the united states 
doherty has fought extradition to britain since his arrest 
he has acknowledged that the british officer was killed in a 
gunfight between troops and his fourman ira unit but claims the 
fighting was political and that he would be persecuted if forced to 
return 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum is considering a request 
that doherty be freed on an 800000 bail package pending 
resolution of the asylum request 
his say his right to due process has been violated by his 
lengthy imprisonment 
dohertys plight has become a rallying point among 
irishamericans here he has been honorary grand marshal of the st 
patricks day parade and has a manhattan street named for him the 
courtroom was filled with supporters tuesday including three 
congressman and several local politicians 
cedarbaum sought dohertys testimony to help decide whether he 
is a flight risk 
the us government which opposes his release will present 
witnesses at a later hearing after which cedarbaum will rule 
doherty testified that he resigned from the ira when he came to 
the united states and has had no contact with its members 
the armed group is fighting to wrest northern ireland from 
british rule and unite it with the irish republic 
even if the ira wanted him i would refuse to go back to them 
because of my commitment to the court and the provisions of bail 
and also to these people in the back doherty said my life is 
minuscule compared to the irishamerican community 
however us attorney otto obermaier sought to discredit 
doherty stressing his use of a false passport to enter the united 
states and a false social security number to get work 
a federal appeals court ruled this summer that doherty has the 
right to seek asylum here

the answers to the case in which a man concocted a 
story about a robber shooting him and his pregnant wife may never 
be known unless the states highest court overrules attorneyclient 
privilege 
the husband charles stuart has since committed suicide and 
prosecutors are asking the court to force stuarts attorney to 
disclose conversations they had before the hoax unraveled 
it may provide the only break for prosecutors considering 
charges against stuarts brother who says he was an unwitting 
accomplice 
attorneys for the stuart family will contend in hearings set for 
this week that attorneyclient privilege remains intact and 
although prosecutors will argue the privilege should be overridden 
in the interest of justice some legal observers say that is shaky 
ground at best 
theres not much precedent for this said phyllis goldfarb 
a professor at the boston college law school 
carol stuart 30 was shot in the head on the night of oct 23 
minutes after she and her husband drove away from a prenatal class 
at brigham and womens hospital 
wounded himself stuart called police and guided them to his 
location using his cars cellular telephone his dramatic 
anguished plea for help over the telephone was widely broadcast 
mrs stuart died hours after the attack her prematurely delivered 
son died 17 days after that 
stuart claimed a black man had kidnapped them forced them to 
drive to a deserted area robbed and then shot them many saw the 
incident as a symbol of urban crime 
then on jan 3 matthew stuart went to authorities and 
implicated his brother in the shooting charles stuart leaped to 
his death from a bridge the next day 
nearly a year after the crime the grand jury investigating the 
case has stalled over whether matthew stuarts role was really that 
of an unwitting accomplice as he claimed 
prosecutors want the privilege broken in order to learn whether 
stuart told his lawyer john dawley that matthew was involved in a 
plot to kill mrs stuart and cover up the crime by staging a fake 
robbery 
according to a judges memorandum the grand jury was told that 
matthew was to meet his brother at a predetermined location oct 23 
to get items that later would be claimed to have been stolen and 
an insurance claim would be filed 
the grand jury according to the report was told matthew pulled 
alongside his brothers car and talked to him but was not aware 
his brother was wounded or that mrs stuart was in the car 
matthew told police his brother passed him several items 
including a handgun he said he dropped the gun and a womans 
handbag into the pines river in revere 
the items were later recovered and the gun was identified as the 
one used to shoot the stuarts 
at a hearing in april assistant district attorney thomas mundy 
said matthew stuart was a potential target of the grand jury 
investigation and indicated dawleys testimony could shed light on 
matthews possible role in the case 
on friday prosecutors will argue before the supreme judicial 
court that the public interest mandates that dawley break his 
deceased clients confidentiality and tell what he knows 
we are arguing in the interests of justice said paul leary 
first assistant district attorney for suffolk county 
we feel as though theres a compelling interest that if we can 
gain whatever additional information dawley may have justice will 
be served he added 
nancy gertner a lawyer for matthew stuart called that a 
completely uphill argument 
goldfarb the professor said attorneyclient discussions could 
be disclosed in some circumstances for example if their contents 
were revealed to a third party 
but i havent found any cases where it was argued that the 
public interest overrides the privilege she said 
goldfarb said courts in most states have ruled that 
attorneyclient privileges survived the death of a client and went 
to the next of kin 
gertner said she doubted the value of dawleys testimony about 
his talks with stuart even if the privilege was waived 
charles stuart was capable of lying to everyone gertner 
said

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south

deployment overseas

when 22 members of the grahamharris 
family assembled to sing happy birthday to the family patriarch 
their celebration site was an unlikely one a bustling army post 
preparing for possible war 
there was no choice two key family members are part of that 
preparation 
don graham and henry harris are brothersinlaw who belong to 
the 265th quartermaster detachment a south carolina national guard 
unit getting ready for deployment to the mideast 
the water purification unit has been at fort stewart training 
hard since thursday as a reward the men got labor day afternoon 
off so most of the mens families made the twohour drive from 
their homes around allendale sc where the unit is based 
harris wife sister and brothers were there graham had the 
biggest turnout a caravan of brothers and sisters their children 
and five of his own seven children the guest of honor was his 
father earnest graham who turned 83 on tuesday 
don graham a 37yearold construction supervisor joined the 
guard with his brotherinlaw 17 years ago he accepts his 
assignment to the mideast with little emotion its something we 
got to do he said 
he said he is proud of his children and wants to see them grow 
up but he said he doesnt spend time worrying about less pleasant 
possibilities 
you cant predict life you could go out the door and get 
killed he said something like this makes you appreciate life 
more 
graham and the other unit members couldnt go off post so they 
gave their relatives a limited tour of the military complex an 
extended visit to the px and lunch at a fastfood franchise 
the families also got a glimpse of the units accommodations a 
long barracks of cinder block and wood built to sleep 40 
the quarters are kindly described as spartan no water dim 
overhead bulbs and little ventilation it bakes during the day and 
retains the heat well into the night 
the men have spread out over the big barracks taking bunks in 
clusters that describe the dynamics of the group 
three sergeants occupy the far end and gather most nights to 
play guts an aptly named card game of bluffing and side bets they 
play for quarters now but back in allendale they are joined by 
other friends each friday night for games of much bigger stakes 
sometimes we have 10 people sitting around the table said 
hullie cohen a burly contractor 
the men joke with their wives about going to bed at 8 pm they 
make tentative plans to see each other again depending on the 
units status what they dont talk about is the mideast and their 
likely deployment 
the men hardly talk about it among themselves when they do it 
is usually to joke about the heat 
some have suggested landscapers be sent in ahead of the unit to 
plant shade trees others suggest just a little more seriously 
that they sell the water they will purify to the saudis at prices 
equivalent to gasoline 
in conversations some say they are eager to go others wish 
they could go back home there is little mention of political 
issues there is an absence of bravado 
on their second day of mobilization the unit went to a post 
orientation meeting with a larger group of florida reservists 
called up to work at the post hospital 
as the session was ending a lieutenant colonel asked the 265th 
to stand up these men he told the 200 other reservists were on 
their way to the mideast 
these are your friends and neighbors just up the road he 
said this is a great outfit 
the rest of the hall burst into applause the 14 men from 
allendale exchanged grim nervous glances mostly they looked down 
at their feet

teachers with computer skills are turning their 
classrooms into models of education reform tailoring lessons to 
meet students individual needs in subjects from french to science 
a new study finds 
the firstofitskind survey of 608 computersavvy teachers in 
576 schools across the country found that many have learned ways to 
individualize lessons and teach more sophisticated material using 
computers 
the survey released monday by the bank street college of 
educations center for technology in education found teachers 
using computers in ways that go far beyond the usual 
drillandpractice 
more than 9 out of 10 said they use word processors for writing 
lessons as many as twothirds produced readymade art and more 
than 70 percent used terminals for problemsolving programs 
drillandpractice lessons especially in math or tutorial 
programs 
more than half the social studies teachers surveyed 52 percent 
used computers to construct databases 
i think that its very clear that what these teachers have 
accomplished is exactly the kinds of things people engaged in 
reform are trying to accomplish said karen sheingold director 
of the center and coauthor of the report with bank street 
researcher martha hadley 
eightyeight percent believe their computer knowledge has 
transformed classroom life they have higher expectations of their 
students present more complex material and believe their students 
are gaining better thinking skills 
but teachers also complained of having too few computers 
printers and other hardware and scarce time to plan and conduct 
computer lessons 
the report recommended that schools rethink their schedules so 
that teachers have the time they need 
teachers taking part in the mailed survey conducted in the 
spring of 1989 taught grades 4 through 12 in all 50 states they 
were identified as knowledgeable about computers by computer and 
software companies and education groups 
spreading the classroom computer revolution is possible but 
only if there are enough technology support and time for teachers 
to plan lessons and a school structure in which teachers may 
experiment with new technology the report concluded 
the center for technology in education operates under a 
fiveyear 49 million grant from the federal office of 
educational research and improvement

leaders of the seven nations on the 
baltic sea have agreed to curb the pollution that has killed a 
third of life on the sea bed but the eastern europeans say theyll 
need western aid for the effort 
its a breakthrough for the ecological restoration of the 
baltic sea said swedish prime minister ingvar carlsson 
carlsson and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of poland hosted 
the twoday conference which ended monday with agreement that a 
comprehensive plan for cleaning up the baltic would be prepared by 
the end of next year 
greenpeace international said the conferences declaration was 
too vague the environmental organization has already criticized 
the baltic nations for aiming too low with their 1988 plan to halve 
emissions into the baltic by 1995 
sweden and denmark already have national cleanup strategies and 
the conference was seen as stepping up pressure on the soviet union 
and former east bloc countries to catch up 
eastern european delegates acknowledged that they have lagged in 
pollution control but made it clear they would need western money 
and expertise to help end environmentally damaging practices 
the policy of earmarking meager financing for conservation 
activities in the past is responsible for this state of affairs 
said vatsilu doguzhiev deputy chairman of the soviet council of 
ministers 
ecological problems require an enormous amount of effort and 
finance he said 
according to papers presented at the conference half of all 
nitrogen emissions into the baltic come from poland one of the 
most serious sources of pollution is the vistula river which flows 
into the sea 
several scientific studies have shown that the baltic is 
suffocating as phosphates and nitrates flood the sea encouraging 
the growth of algae that uses up the oxygen needed by plants and 
fish 
mazowiecki stressed the need for the cleanup but said his 
countrys involvement may be unrealistic without significant 
technological and financial support from abroad

defense contractors at the 
farnborough international air show say the military buildup in the 
middle east will do little to reverse the sales decline caused by 
the easing of eastwest tensions 
industry executives meeting at this weeks show to socialize and 
do business say that despite iraqs invasion of kuwait a month ago 
longterm defense orders will continue to decrease 
talk of the persian gulf crisis fills the blue and 
whitestriped tents at farnborough 40 miles west of london and 
there are reminders of the confrontation 
the us military buildup in the persian gulf region has 
deprived the show of its expected star attraction the f117a 
stealth fighter 
beneath a display of exocet missiles hostesses in 
goldbuttoned red knit suits welcome visitors to the exhibit of 
aerospatiale the french manufacturer of missiles that are in the

missiles division said the crisis had given the defense industry a 
psychological boost but the kick has not been felt in sales 
worldwide defense expenditures are expected to drop from 1 
trillion to 800 billion by 1999 said a defense spokesman for 
british aerospace plc 
boeing vice president philip condit said the persian gulf crisis 
had made governments more aware of the need for defense flexibility 
but it would not mean an aboutface on defense spending cuts 
it has given us a broad awareness of the need for military 
fitness he said in an interview 
ron howard chairman of gec avionics sounded more optimistic 
overall the situation in the gulf has had the effect of 
convincing the world that you cannot walk away from defense 
commitments as originally thought because of warsaw pact detente 
howard said 
a good outlook for commercial orders is expected to offset 
drooping defense orders for firms like boeing and mcdonnell 
douglas which supply both defense and civilian markets 
boeings condit said fuel price rises have not forced any 
cancellations or delays of this years expected record production 
of 381 commercial planes

dick clay a burly germanirish hoosier 
with mustache and beer belly doesnt look much like a filipino 
but he made a daring escape from kuwait disguised as one with 
fake philippine documents ingeniously forged by a loyal friend 
clay 46 managed to slip across the iraqijordanian frontier 
last week with 34 filipino employees by pretending he was one of 
them his weeklong flight took all the ingenuity of world war ii 
prisoners flight from stalag 17 he had to hide for three days in 
the iraqi capital swarming with saddam husseins secret police 
and their army of informers and tough out a heartstopping 
encounter with iraqi border guards 
his onepage travel document was a masterpiece of fakery a 
filipino instrument technician spent 10 laborious days duplicating 
the philippines embassy seal and a creating a long inscription in 
tiny english characters 
the stamp was fashioned from a rubber shower sandal the black 
ink was made royal purple by diluting it with milk 
on paper the american construction manager richard eugene clay 
became ricardo erazo his hometown of bloomington ind where his 
wife claudia and three children were waiting became batangas city 
in the philippines 
i was hiding in kuwait until the iraqis said theyd hang 
anyone who helped shelter foreigners clay said in an interview 
then i figured it was time to go 
that was aug 20 almost three weeks after iraq overran kuwait 
by then he was ready 
even with his false papers prepared clays appearance posed 
problems 
filipinos tend to be small and slender darkeyed and 
darkhaired but clays face is a great red expanse of rugged 
terrain with a prominent sunburned nose and distinctly european 
eyes and he has a large us navy tattoo on his right hand 
he pulled a baseball cap down low over his brown hair wore 
large sunglasses and disappeared into a roomy longsleeved shirt 
that didnt help much but he had no choice 
in kuwait clay supervised 500 filipino and indian workers at 
mw kellogg a us contractor that maintained two oil refineries 
in the emirate he accounted for all but four and then prepared to 
escape himself 
food and water were gathered and stashed away exit documents 
were sought a route was planned 
when everything else was ready i told em to go out and steal 
two buses clay said by then the filipinos were desperate to 
leave the gulf state where some had worked for a decade 
i know of one case where 12 iraqi soldiers raped a filipino 
lady clay said they killed her brother when he tried to help 
her thats a fact she was still in the hospital when i left 
clay left behind 85000 in the bank and an apartment full of 
belongings that he doesnt expect to see again 
his small convoy made it to bagdhad after two traffic accidents 
and some close shaves on the border at each roadblock filipino 
friends stood in the bus door and passed out his papers 
the group was stuck in baghdad for three days which clay spent 
huddling between the others in a car or hiding in three hotel rooms 
with 128 others 
he rented another bus for the equivalent of 5000 for the 
sevenhour drive to the jordan border by then his party had grown 
by 25 filipino women 
when clay reached jordan he had to spend three days hiding 
among dozens of real filipinos under a makeshift shelter at a 
squalid desperate camp in no mans land camp past the iraq border 
before the jordanians could process the refugees 
there he sent scouts to find a westerner 
they found jim nuttal of save the children who saved clay 
but the tough part was getting out of iraq clay cleared every 
hurdle finally garnering the treasured exit stamp on his false 
travel document then at a last check before entering jordan an 
iraqi guard stuck his head into the bus 
he glared at clay and said marine 
filipino said clay 
the iraqi took him off the bus for six hours of interrogation 
but his friends rallied around him they piled their luggage 
across the road insisting that if clay was returned to baghdad 
theyd go too 
they scuffled with iraqi guards swinging truncheons finally 
one woman barged into the border office wailing that she could not 
be separated from her uncle 
finally the sternfaced iraqi handed back clays document and 
waved him onward 
with a trace of a smile he said goodbye marine

egyptian soldiers are in saudi arabia 
prepared to fight if iraq invades but thats a thousand miles from 
cairo and life goes on as usual in the teeming metropolis of the 
middle east 
this is mango and guava season decorated carts haul stacks of 
the fruit into the city juice sellers costumed from the pages of 
the arabian nights are popular attractions 
hawkers clog crowded sidewalks with illegal tables holding 
mechanical toys and live tortoises for children hair bows for 
mothers there are evening carriage rides along the nile for those 
with the money to pay 
american and european teenagers summer vacations over have 
returned to their favorite haunts greasy burger pizza hut and 
roys goes mexican at the marriott hotel 
nightly television includes knots landing reruns johnny 
weissmuller swings across the screen in tarzan finds a son 
a recent days outing to the suez canal past dozens of egyptian 
military installations produced one unusual sight a taxi tooling 
down the road with a monkey on top the bases were quiet 
a canalside peanut vendor watched the us navy battleship 
wisconsin and french aircraft carrier clemenceau steam into the red 
sea heading for the persian gulf he barely glanced at the rest of 
the convoy 
ive seen enough ships he said but the helicopter escort 
was great 
in cairo coffeehouses there is far more talk of how to win 
peace than how to wage war 
we all are praying for peace a student said nobody wants 
war 
the tension engendered by iraqs occupation of kuwait on aug 2 
which caused 4000 egyptian soldiers and tens of thousands of 
americans to be sent to saudi arabia seems remote from most of 
cairos 12 million residents 
expatriate parents speak of frantic telephone calls from abroad 
urging caution 
an american grandfather demanded that his daughter bring his 
grandchildren home they are home she replied 
life in cairo surges onward with the same chaos and madness it 
has possessed through the millennium since the city was founded in 
969 
change comes so often and so swiftly to cairo that talk of a 
possible persian gulf war was diluted from the start by more 
immediate cares rising prices for gasoline and food shortages amd 
gigantic sales that brought more jostling people than usual to 
downtown cairo 
august was hot and steamy cairos air quality was lousy 
as always the welltodo including president hosni mubarak 
spent the month at the mediterranean seaside of egypts summer 
capital alexandria schools and universities will not open for 
several weeks 
except for the islamic holy month of ramadan when egyptians 
party all night and sleep until noon august is the only time cairo 
traffic takes a break 
this year however there appeared to be more fenderbenders 
than usual taxi drivers blamed an influx of drivers from the gulf 
kuwaitis cant drive in cairo one said after swerving to 
avoid a collision theyre not used to so many cars 
kuwaiti families stranded by iraqs annexation of their country 
are moving from hotels to apartments becoming part of the calliope 
that is cairo kuwaiti flags fly from some cars others are covered 
by photographs of kuwaits deposed emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah 
tired egyptian workers returning from kuwait and iraq many now 
penniless head for their villages in jammed taxis they carry 
tattered suitcases instead of the household appliances and 
electronic goods they had always been able to bring as gifts 
extra security precautions in cairo are minimal 
since the invasion the government has kept four truckloads of 
helmeted riot police near the iraqi embassy in zamalek a nile 
river island opposite downtown cairo 
at first the trucks stood in relentless sunshine at the 
treeless front of the embassy but wearing riot gear in a covered 
truck is uncomfortable business and the vehicles were moved half a 
block to the protection of shade trees 
officers sit around square tables drinking tea and reading 
newspapers a single truck is parked outside the safir zamalek a 
nearby residential hotel owned by kuwaitis 
security trucks also sit near the embassies of kuwait and saudi 
arabia several miles away farther south along the nile less 
fortunate soldiers spend their hours in hot rickety trucks of 
faded blue halfway between cairo and the rich suburb of maadi 
where many diplomats and wealthy egyptians live 
outside the downtown offices of iraq airways where long lines 
of egyptian workers once waited two policemen lean against the 
polished white facade 
another pair yawn through their watch guarding kuwait airways 
offices in a suburban shopping arcade 
to old hands theres nothing new in all this 
in 1942 cairos cabarets and swinging night life gave no hint 
that the decisive battle of el alamein was raging 150 miles away

drop the novel step away from the car youre 
under arrest for having an overdue library book 
starting on thursday your overdue books could land you in police 
custody a law signed by gov michael s dukakis in june would 
allow the arrest of library scofflaws if they have received notice 
that their books are 30 days overdue 
the law also raises the maximum fine for an overdue book from 
50 to 500 
although the law makes no mention of a jail sentence for an 
overdue book it allows for up to five years in prison and a fine 
of 25000 for the theft of library property worth more than 250 
gregor trinkausrandall a collection management consultant for 
the massachusetts board of library commissioners said librarians 
need tough enforcement tools 
any library book that is not returned therefore has to be 
replaced by the library and is money out of the towns pocket that 
could be spent on other materials he said 
the town of shrewsbury for example loses an estimated 12000 
a year in library materials trinkausrandall said books are not 
cheap he said im not even talking about rare books an art 
book can cost 100 or more 
david linsky a defense attorney in cambridge criticized the 
measure 
i think the police are having enough trouble chasing down 
murderers and rapists without having to keep up with people who 
have overdue library books he said 
trinkausrandall said he expects librarians will use discretion 
in sending police after those with overdue books 
most libraries will go through more notification of somebody 
giving them the benefit of the doubt he said in most of the 
cases they are not going to say on day 31 send the police out 
linsky complained that the law allows the arrest of library 
scofflaws without a warrant something that cant be done with an 
offense such as assault and battery he said the measure is 
absolutely 100 percent unenforceable 
if the police are told by an employee of the library that you 
have an overdue library book then the police can arrest you in any 
public place and put the handcuffs on you he said thats the 
real horror show of this thing 
steven crawford a spokesman for dukakis said the 
administration is taking another look at the law to determine 
whether the questions that are being raised are accurate 
massachusetts is not the first state to get tough on those who 
keep library books at home beyond the due date 
in georgia a woman was jailed overnight when she failed to 
appear in court to explain why her books were not returned the 
woman said she was sure she had returned the books and sued the 
county 500000 last year for being jailed 
in florida and south carolina police have also been put on 
notice to track down those with overdue books

the nations largest black church which once 
censured martin luther king jr for moving too fast on civil 
rights is weighing the first major religious challenge to the us 
troop buildup in the persian gulf 
the 78 millionmember national baptist convention usa inc 
is scheduled to consider at its annual meeting a resolution 
criticizing the sending of troops 
we are not fighting over any principle or ideal the rev 
theodore judson jemison convention president said at welcoming 
ceremonies mondayour fighting right now is over oil its 
unfortunate america would become involved the way it has 
the action comes amid criticism that the denominations new 10 
million headquarters in nashville is too extravagant for a church 
that has long been accused of being slow to respond to social 
issues the church still owes 7 million on the headquarters which 
was dedicated last year 
it the convention is a sleeping giant that tends to remain 
asleep when it tends to wake up it is filled with gross 
overindulgence such as the world baptist center said kane 
felder a professor of new testamament at howard university 
divinity school 
the church is the nations thirdlargest protestant denomination 
and bills itself as the largest black organization in the world 
more than 50000 delegates from the denominations 32000 
churches are expected to attend the 110th annual meeting which 
runs through sunday 
the agenda includes abortion aids homelessness and teenage 
pregnancy along with the middle east it shows the influence of 
jemison who led one of the nations first boycotts of segregated 
busing in baton rouge la in 1953 
under his predecessor the late rev joseph h jackson the 
convention followed a gradual approach to civil rights ousting 
king from a prominent role in a bitter leadership battle in the 
early 1960s 
jemison who sided with jackson during that fight but then led a 
movement that ousted jackson in 1982 has tried to take a more 
aggressive political stance 
while other major religious groups and churches including the 
national conference of catholic bishops and national council of 
churches have been cautious not to criticize the deployment of 
troops in saudi arabia after iraqs invasion of kuwait jemison 
questioned the cost and morality of the action 
think of the good that the billion dollars could do for black 
america and poor white america he said 
jemison is coming under some similar criticism over the new 
world baptist center 
felder said the expense is a travesty when the church faces 
such problems as drug abuse and teenage pregnancy others defend 
the center the first such headquarters ever built by a black 
church organization 
i think its a good status symbol for our people said the 
rev allen stanley a convention vice president 
to some observers the jury is still out on how well jemison has 
realized kings dreams of turning the institution into a force for 
social change 
how well this administration has been able to achieve those 
ends is difficult to assess because so much has been invested in 
the building of the world baptist center said forrest harris 
director of the kelly miller institute on the black church at 
vanderbilt university

twentythree years after they were 
first used in vietnam combat hunterkiller helicopter tactics 
are being updated with the latest in nightflying technology and 
interservice cooperation 
as darkness fell monday over the desert a small army oh58 
scout helicopter loaded with special gear for night operations 
lifted off from an airbase runway 
just behind it came two of the marine corps newest ah1 cobras 
the whiskey model that has twice the power and three times the 
lethal punch of its indochinaera ancestor 
earlier in the day the pilots sat together for a briefing on 
the nights twohour training mission 
together the pilots from the armys 82nd airborne division and 
marine light attack squadron 269 formed a hunterkiller team 
designed to destroy enemy tanks before the tanks are aware of their 
presence 
the technique was first developed in vietnam where army pink 
teams combined a scout helicopter to find enemy bunker complexes 
and jungle camps with a cobra gunship to destroy them with rockets 
and machine guns 
if war with iraq breaks out officers said the technique will 
be applied to baghdads tank formations in the open desert where 
us forces expect to have a wide edge in nightvision capability 
and weaponry 
this is a perfect environment over here we re working 
specifically to fly in that environment specifically to fly at 
night because that is probably what were going to be called on to 
do said lt col kenneth hill of tulsa okla commander of the 
marine air unit 
the army helicopters are the result of years of effort to 
develop an aircraft for special operations in darkness 
they were first used for night patrol duty during the persian 
gulf tanker war in 198788 
one pilot told then of hovering within easy view of fishing 
boats whose occupants were unaware of his presence 
they never look up he said 
the cobras sitting on the saudi flightline are the latest 
models all less than a year old 
their engines produce about 3300 horsepower twice that of the 
vietnam version they carry laserguided hellfire missiles and 
other weapons that were less sophisticated or nonexistent in 
indochina days

jupiters great red spot may soon lose some 
of its red because of a change in the weather on the largest planet 
in the solar system 
a 6200milewide belt of clouds on the planet is starting to 
change to its typical dark brown smoggy color 13 months after it 
turned white astronomers say when the belt turns brown its winds 
start feeding ammonia ice crystals into the great red spot washing 
out some of the color 
the great red spot is a hurricane almost twice the size of 
earth the cloud belt or southern equatorial belt sits just north 
of the great red spot 
several astronomers from nasas infrared telescope facility on 
hawaiis mauna kea volcano and from other observatories around the 
world reported the change to the international astronomical unions 
central bureau for astronomical telegrams an astronomy reporting 
agency in cambridge mass 
scientists study weather on other planets to understand rules 
governing weather on all planets including earth 
in july 1989 british astronomer gm hurst first noticed that 
the southern equatorial belt was changing from brown to white and 
growing colder 
but during the past two weeks astronomers observed the cloud 
belt starting to turn brown and get warmer according to telegrams 
sent by the central bureau on aug 22 and on wednesday 
the belt changes to white when jupiters internal heat pushes 
enough ammonia ice crystals upward in the atmosphere where winds 
over 300 mph spread the crystals out to form a white deck of 
lightreflecting cirrus clouds 
the cloud belt changes to brown when violent storms mix 
jupiters atmospheric gases allowing sunlight to trigger reactions 
by the ammonia and natural gas that creates brownish smog in the 
planets atmosphere 
when the cloud belt turns white the winds diminish reducing 
the amount of ice entering the great red spot and allowing it to 
turn darker red 
the cloud belt faded from brown to white in the early 1970s 
then turned brown again in 1974 remaining that way until 13 
months ago 
the great red spot faded to dim gray in 1976 but regained its 
brick red color after the southern equatorial belt turned white 
last year

two weekends of monsoon rains in 
manila and the northern provinces have killed at least 65 people 
destroying roads and flooding the homes of tens of thousands of 
people officials said today 
officials said the flooding in the capital the worst in nearly 
two decades was aggravated by uncollected trash that blocked 
drainage canals 
emilia tadeo a spokeswoman of the office of civil defense said 
30 people died and four others were missing in floods over the 
weekend she said most of about 300000 people whose homes were 
flooded were evacuated from manila and seven provinces north of the 
capital 
mrs tadeo said 35 people were killed including 12 children 
buried in a landslide and 27 injured during a heavy downpour a 
week earlier floods destroyed or damaged the homes of about 
250000 people 
two of the latest victims died when tons of garbage crumbled and 
destroyed their house at a dumpsite in the slum district of tondo 
thirteen others were buried under a landslide in nueva vizcaya 
province 
at least 52 villages in the provinces of pampanga and tarlac 
remained isolated by floodwaters from heavy rains that began 
saturday mrs tadeo said 
the armys 51st engineering brigade said landslides destroyed an 
18mile section of a highway to nueva vizcaya and another 18mile 
portion was washed away by floodwaters 
five other major northern highways also were blocked by 
landslides and a bridge in tarlac province was washed away by a 
river that overflowed its banks

defenders of first amendment rights lament the 
retirement of supreme court justice william j brennan but say the 
views of his prospective replacement david h souter on freedom 
of speech and the press are somewhat encouraging 
no one could conclude he has an ax to grind against the media 
or against first amendment claims henry kaufman of the promedia 
libel defense resource center said of souter arguably we will 
get a fair hearing but hes no brennan 
brennan retired in july after a 34year career as the high 
courts leading voice of liberalism he wrote a 1964 landmark 
opinion giving the news media broad protection against libel suits 
by public figures and recently authored opinions barring criminal 
prosecution of those who burn the american flag in protest 
the senate judiciary committee is scheduled to begin hearings on 
souters nomination sept 13 most of what is known of his views 
have come from his writings as a new hampshire state judge 
president bush named souter to the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals in boston this year 
some who have studied the handful of opinions souter wrote on 
first amendment issues during his seven years on the new hampshire 
supreme court say they are heartened that bush didnt choose 
someone with apparent rigid ideas that could limit free expression 
i think hes been very balanced on freepress issues said 
claudia haskell of the first amendment congress hes in the 
mainstream 
however the advocates said they dont expect souter to be an 
ardent defender of free expression if he wins confirmation 
kaufman said souters opinions seem to reflect more interest 
in the complexity of the law than a passion for the 
underlying rights at issue 
souters decisions seem to reflect a cautious craftsman whose 
views are not expansive in protecting first amendment rights 
said floyd abrams a new york lawyer whose clients include the news 
media 
there are so many areas of the law in which someone would want 
to know judge souters philosophic views that i think in his case 
more than most the exploration of his general orientation may 
indeed tell more than could be learned from particular cases 
abrams said he added that his conclusions could change after 
souter testifies to the judiciary committee 
some commentators said they were encouraged that souter had 
expressed in cases unrelated to the first amendment strong 
support for supreme court precedent 
jane kirtley head of the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press said she was pleased that souter appears to have little 
inclination to topple key rulings 
lets face it weve got some good court decisions sitting up 
there right now she said i dont see anything that would 
suggest souter would be antimedia 
here is a summary of souters opinions in some first amendment 
cases as a state supreme court judge 
souter wrote for the court in 1985 when it reinstated a police 
officers libel suit against a newspaper that published a letter to 
the editor accusing the officer of misconduct 
souter said a jury is entitled to decide whether the letter made 
factual assertions or only expressed opinions shielded from libel 
attack 
the ruling in some respects seems to have foreshadowed a us 
supreme court decision this year that has the news media worried 
it said statements of opinion are not automatically immune to libel 
suits if arguably they contain factual assertions 
in 1984 souter wrote for the court in upholding a libel 
verdict against a newspaper that published an editorial about 
obscene and harassing telephone calls the newspaper was sued 
by a man mentioned in the editorial who was convicted of making 
harassing but not obscene calls 
while the newspaper had published a separate accurate account of 
the case souter said the publication was negligent in printing an 
editorial referring to obscene phone calls 
souter dissented from the courts 1988 opinion that permitted a 
libel suit against hustler magazine 
the court allowed an outofstate resident to take advantage of 
a new hampshire law that a publication may be sued for libel for up 
to six years after making a defamatory statement most states 
allowed only three years to sue 
souter said the ruling encouraged the evil practice of 
forumshopping and said the state had little interest in protecting 
the reputation of someone who never set foot in new hampshire 
prior to trial 
writing for the court last year souter barred a supporter of 
presidential candidate lyndon larouche from attaching a cardboard 
sign to a tree and lamppost outside city hall in manchester nh 
but souter said the man was free to pass out leaflets there without 
a permit 
while a trial judge in 1981 souter ruled in favor of two 
reporters for the university of new hampshire student newspaper who 
said they were trying to protect their confidential sources the 
judge barred a murder defendant from forcing the reporters to 
testify 
souter said the defendants claim that revealing the sources 
might point to other suspects in the murder was sheer 
speculation

democrat rudy perpich says his major 
contribution over the last eight years as governor has been to 
restore confidence in minnesota next week perpich himself faces a 
crucial vote of confidence 
backers say the 62yearold incumbent is a visionary leader who 
deserves an unprecedented fourth term while critics call him 
governor goofy or say hes simply been around too long 
if voters endorse the latter view in the sept 11 
democraticfarmerlabor primary former state commerce commissioner 
mike hatch will be the partys standardbearer in november 
the race is a dead heat according to a recent public opinion 
poll and political observers say it could turn on any lastminute 
mistakes by either campaign 
in the independentrepublican primary state auditor arne 
carlson holds a 21 lead over his closest rival businessman jon 
grunseth the partys endorsed candidate 
perpich who first served as governor in 1977 and 1978 when he 
completed the unexpired term of former gov wendell anderson says 
minnesota is in far better shape now than it was when he returned 
to the office in 1983 
we are without doubt the no 1 state in the nation perpich 
said during a televised debate with hatch last week there isnt 
a state thats better than we are in 1983 we couldnt compete 
with south dakota today were beating the world 
perpich also points to his experience as a plus in the event of 
a recession brought on by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
we are ready for the oil crisis if it should happen he 
said we are prepared to ensure that all minnesotans will have 
fuel to heat their homes run their businesses and carry on with 
their lives we are also ready if the economy suffers the state 
budget reserve will allow us to maintain programs for the people of 
minnesota our strong and diverse economy will protect peoples 
jobs 
perpich with a boost from soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs oneday visit to minnesota in june after the summit 
took his partys endorsement from hatch who served as perpichs 
commerce commissioner from 1983 through 1989 
but the governors june achievements did not significantly 
improve his standing in public opinion polls which continued to 
show his approval rating at a nearrecord low 
perpichs summer was marred by developments involving two 
onceclose political associates exmidwest federal savings and 
loan chairman harold greenwood jr who was indicted in connection 
with the sampls demise and former greater minnesota corp president 
terry montgomery the governors exchief of staff who faces 
allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of public funds 
hatch 41 says perpich has been distracted lately he cites the 
montgomery and greenwood affairs and perpichs disputes with the 
news media earlier this year over his lifestyle which led the 
incumbent to propose selling the governors mansion and giving up 
his lincoln town car and driver 
after eight years past mistakes and personal vanities become 
the focus of an administration hatch said too many barnacles 
attach to the ship of state and it simply wont steer straight 
providing access to affordable health care for all minnesotans 
has been a major focus of hatchs campaign and it is the only 
issue that has sparked a public dispute between the camps 
hatch has called health care policy in the state a scandal and 
perpich has accused hatch of distorting his record on the issue 
the candidates hold similar views on many other issues with the 
major exception being abortion perpich describes himself as 
antiabortion and has said he would sign legislation that would 
outlaw most abortions in the state hatch who supports legalized 
abortion has pointed out the difference in campaign ads but 
neither campaign has dwelled on the issue 
perpich and hatch each was supported by 46 percent of dflers 
likely to vote in the primary according to a star tribunekstp 
minnesota poll conducted by telephone from aug 1220 among 900 
adults the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 33 
percentage points 
in the independentrepublican race the minnesota poll found 
carlson 55 with a commanding lead over grunseth 44 and former 
federal prosecutor doug kelley 43 who once served as sen dave 
durenbergers chief of staff 
carlson was supported by 46 percent of republicans likely to 
vote in the primary while grunseth had the support of 24 percent 
and kelley of 8 percent 
party leaders have come to grunseths aid claiming carlson is 
too liberal for rankandfile republicans on the issues of abortion 
and gun control 
carlson supports legalized abortion and voted for the states 
gun control law as a legislator in the 1970s grunseth opposes 
abortion and supports a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing 
the right to bear arms

bread one of the few foods soviet consumers have 
been able to obtain easily is now in short supply in moscow for 
the first time since the early 1960s 
despite a record grain harvest this year many of moscows bread 
stores were empty on monday and there were long lines at others 
some irate consumers blamed president mikhail s gorbachevs 
economic reforms 
thats perestroika were not moving forward were going 
backward said viktor lyubeznov a 52yearold electrician who 
went to four moscow bread stores before finding a loaf 
now we think freely we speak freely but the economic 
situation is more severe than ever said irina samoruppa 65 
russians have long been accustomed to shortages of fresh 
vegetables fruits and meat they have no microwave foods and no 
24hour convenience stores but heavy russian bread baked in 
central factories and sold at subsidized prices has always been 
fresh and plentiful 
the last time people remember long bread lines was under former 
premier nikita khrushchev who was ousted in 1964 
if the shortage continues it will be especially hard on 
retirees some receive pensions of just 30 to 60 rubles 48 to 
96 a month and survive largely on bread which costs just 15 to 
25 kopecks a kilogram 11 to 18 cents a pound 
the newspapers moskovskaya pravda and izvestia blamed the 
shortage on moscows bakeries which they said were unable to keep 
up with the sudden rise in demand when residents returned from 
their traditional august vacations 
izvestia said the bottleneck was not the harvest but moscows 
central bread bakeries which have changed little since the 1950s 
when the population was about half the current 88 million 
inside moscows bread store no 150 tempers flared monday as 
customers accused saleswomen of saving the last few loaves of white 
bread for themselves 
look comrades they have more left back there they just 
wont sell it one woman cried 
you dont know what youre talking about so just be quiet 
answered a husky saleswoman in a white apron 
outside along busy kutuzovsky prospekt customers gathered in 
clusters to commiserate 
never in my life have i ever had to search for bread before 
said anatoly znamensky a 66yearold retired taxi driver 
vegetables fruit cheese butter meat they appear and 
disappear but with bread there was never a problem until now 
the lack of bread comes on the heels of a summerlong shortage 
of tobacco that has led to street demonstrations in moscow and 
leningrad strikes in other russian cities and a riot in a ural 
mountains city 
in addition gasoline has become hard to find hard cheese has 
virtually disappeared from stores in moscow and as school 
reopened shelves were bare of the notebooks children are required 
to use in class 
of all the shortages however bread is potentially the most 
politically troubling if only because of its historical symbolism 
when lenin returned from exile to lead the revolution in 1917 
he promised communism would bring peace land and bread

former dictator jose efrain rios montt has 
lost another round in his campaign to defy a constitutional ban and 
run for president 
the supreme electoral tribunal a council that is the highest 
electoral authority on monday rejected rios montts appeal of its 
refusal last week to allow him to run in nov 11 elections 
he still can take the case to the supreme court and the court of 
constitutionality in a nonbinding opinion last year the supreme 
court said the constitution prohibited him from running 
the 1986 constitution prohibits from running for president or 
vice president anyone who has held power as a result of a coup 
armed revolution or any other action that violated the constitution 
rios montt a retired army general held power for about 16 
months after a march 1982 military coup the military ousted him in 
an august 1983 coup that installed gen oscar humberto mejia 
victores 
backed by three conservative political parties rios montt tried 
to register as a candidate despite the ban was refused and began 
the series of appeals the deadline for registration is sept 12 
rios montt presided over an army antiguerrilla campaign fraught 
with human rights abuses and had 15 convicted leftists executed by 
firing squad some of them during a visit by pope john paul ii 
he is seen as a lawandorder candidate and his strong showing 
in early polls was attributed to the countrys increasing crime 
president vinicio cerezo whose fouryear term expires jan 14

president bush is sending two highlevel 
delegations on a global search for billions of dollars to support 
the economic and military campaign against iraq 
but given the puny response before the missions even left some 
observers wondered whether getting the allies to contribute money 
will prove almost as tough as persuading iraqs saddam hussein to 
leave kuwait 
to emphasize the importance of the mission bush selected two of 
his closest cabinet advisers secretary of state james a baker iii 
and treasury secretary nicholas brady to head the delegations 
brady was leaving today for paris and meetings with top french 
officials in a globetrotting trip that in four days also will take 
him to london seoul south korea and tokyo 
baker was expected to leave later this week for a whirlwind tour 
of oilrich middle eastern countries with later stops planned in 
west germany and italy 
the administration has a lot riding on the baker and brady 
platepassing campaign bush hopes to quiet complaints in congress 
that rich allies such as japan and west germany who are more 
dependent on persian gulf oil than the united states are not 
shouldering their fair share of the burden 
even more importantly the administration hopes the baker and 
brady trips will provide a dramatic boost to stiffen the resolve of 
countries to support the trade embargo against iraq 
the administration has not released a figure of how much in 
financial support it wants but published reports have put the 
amount at around 25 billion in the first year 
one proposal reviewed by the national security council carried a 
23 billion price tag with 10 billion earmarked to ease the 
financial pain of supporting the embargo for such countries as 
egypt turkey and jordan the rest of the money would go to support 
the us military buildup in the persian gulf region 
so far however the amount of assistance being offered is far 
below that level 
the administration is worried that without a substantial pool of 
economic assistance countries will begin cheating on the trade 
embargo thus jeopardizing the main tool that bush hopes to use to 
force iraq out of kuwait 
the presidents effort has raised questions about the propriety 
of a global call for donations to support the us military with 
critics charging that it leaves the appearance that american 
soldiers are up for hire 
i dont want to leave any impression in the world that we pay 
for our soldiers and our sailors if we send them into another part 
of the world only through another countrys money said sen 
patrick leahy dvt this is not a for rent military its not 
a mercenary force 
leahy said a better approach to take would be to boost taxes if 
necessary to pay for the gulf buildup 
bush has rejected suggestions that putting pressure on the 
allies for money to support the us military was improper and he 
has received support from other members of congress who said the 
allies should be doing more 
the japanese have a hell of a stake in this and they ought to 
pay a hell of a share said sen frank lautenberg dnj 
still private analysts saw the pledgeseeking missions as a 
stark reminder of where americas global fortunes now stand as the 
worlds largest debtor nation the united states lacks the economic 
wherewithal to go it alone 
we are no longer the economic superpower we used to be said 
lawrence chimerine of the economic strategy institute a washington 
research organization our changing role in the world economy is 
clearly in evidence here 
in launching the burdensharing initiative last week bush 
maintained that the shape of the postcold war world was at 
stake in the gulf crisis some analysts agreed 
c fred bergsten a former treasury department official in the 
carter administration said bushs effort could well serve as a 
prototype for future global cooperation in which the us military 
would stand ready to preserve peace with financial backing from 
other countries 
some americans are not going to like that because it sounds 
like we are mercenaries said bergsten who now heads the 
institute for international economics but the fact is that the 
world is an insecure place and we have the military capability to 
make a difference

rail and barge movements of farm commodities 
into market channels have been fairly normal this year and should 
continue in good shape through this falls big harvest season an 
agriculture department report says 
the mideast crisis is driving up oil prices and analyst tq 
hutchinson of the departments economic research service said that 
probably will boost transportation costs in the coming months 
but because railroads often hold significant inventories of 
diesel fuel and obtain fuel under longterm contracts their costs 
are partly shielded from shortterm fluctuations in fuel prices 
he said 
rail rates have increased only slightly reflecting declining 
railroad operating costs over the past 12 months adjusted for 
productivity increases hutchinson said for the third quarter of 
1990 the interstate commerce commission has projected costs 
adjusted for productivity to be down 1 percent from the second 
quarter 
river barge operators will try to pass on higher fuel costs but 
competitive pressures may dampen attempts to raise rates 
writing in the september issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
hutchinson said the nations transportation services are expected 
to be adequate for the remainder of the year 
however projected low water flows from the missouri river 
mean that navigation will be difficult on the mississippi river 
between st louis and memphis this fall he said 
streamflow throughout the huge mississippi and missouri 
watersheds plummeted last year in the aftermath of the 1988 drought 
and its lingering effects in the northern great plains 
the army corps of engineers has announced that the missouri 
river will be closed for navigation beginning nov 1 the same as 
last year 
that will boost the cost of grain marketing for companies that 
usually depend on missouri but it will not markedly cramp the 
distribution systems ability to handle demand hutchinson said 
looking at operations earlier this year hutchinson said the 
mississippi river system returned to its dominant role in 
transporting feed grains for export 
in the first six months of 1990 he said corn accounted for 77 
percent of the downstream traffic on the mississippi and soybeans 
13 percent may shipments were a 10year high for the month 
mississippi water levels were high in the spring with march 
readings at st louis averaging 138 percent above a year earlier 
and 13 percent above the months 44year average 
by july there was a substantial lowering to 186 feet although 
the longterm average at st louis for july is only 134 feet 
hutchinson said the july 1989 average reading was 17 feet 
water levels are expected to fall for the remainder of the 
year the analyst wrote even so towboat captains have become 
experienced with low water conditions and the new melvin price 
lock and dam complex near alton ill is expected to greatly 
reduce the number and length of backups that characterized the past 
two seasons 
hutchinson said that as navigation improved barge rates to new 
orleans dropped from their peaks last december of 1215 per ton at 
peoria ill and 705 at st louis by march those averaged 
643 from peoria and 492 from st louis 
but in april rates rose sharply in response to a 28 percent 
increase in grain volume he said at peoria rates advanced 25 
percent to 806 per ton and at st louis the high was only 
slightly less 23 percent to 604 per ton 
hutchinson said barge rates on the illinois and mississippi 
waterways declined in may and june and that further reductions 
occurred in july according to preliminary indications 
although this years barge situation has improved the longrun 
prospects for navigation on the mississippi are less optimistic 
hutchinson said that in the 1988 drought year 60 percent to 80 
percent of the total water flow at st louis came from the missouri 
river and between 40 percent and 60 percent of the flow came from 
the missouri river reservoir system in montana and the dakotas 
the figures for 1989 are not yet available he said but the 
percentages are believed to be about the same as for 1988 
normally runoff chiefly from snowmelt would add 25 million 
acrefeet of water to the reservoirs each year hutchinson said 
but from 1987 to 1989 only 125 million to 213 million were 
added annually 
the forecast for 1990 was 205 million acrefeet of runoff for 
the reservoirs but hutchinson said the actual runoff apparently 
will be somewhat less than that 
the corps of engineers estimates that it will take six years 
of normal runoff to raise the missouri river reservoirs to full 
capacity he said 
in june heavy rains raised the missouris level at kansas city 
to nearly 20 feet up 300 percent from a year earlier but at sioux 
city iowa levels in june averaged 166 feet down about one foot 
from june 1989 
hutchinson said the corps of engineers decided to terminate the 
navigation season on nov 1 and reduce the flow of water to about 
82 percent of normal suggesting that water levels will plummet in 
november 
last november the rivers level at sioux city averaged 10 feet 
at the flood gauge a sixfoot drop from october he said it seems 
probable that the flow from the missouri into the mississippi this 
year will be no more and probably less than in 1989 
thus navigation conditions on the mississippi between st 
louis and cairo ill should remain adequate through the summer 
but could deteriorate early in the fall hutchinson said low 
water might be encountered well before the winter freeze

a us aid official is flying to angola this 
week hoping to win approval for emergency relief for tens of 
thousands of people facing starvation because of drought and 
warfare 
the leftist angolan government has rejected proposals for a 
crossborder assistance program because of concern that the 
supplies could contain us weapons for anticommunist rebels 
andrew natsios director of the office of foreign disaster 
assistance is expected to arrive in the angolan capital of luanda 
later this week to discuss the issue with government officials the 
office is an arm of the us agency for international development 
natsios also plans to visit the affected areas which cover a 
broad stretch of territory along in the southern part of the 
country and encompasses both government and rebelheld zones 
officials believe the potential for a catastrophic famine 
probably is greater in southern angola than in any other region of 
africa 
but the angolan governments hardline stance reflects a 
wariness that the united states which has been arming the unita 
rebels since 1986 may use a crossborder relief operation to run 
guns to the rebels the most likely headquarters for a relief 
program are neighboring botswana and namibia 
the bush administration derided angolas concerns as 
absolutely ridiculous and said any such program would be 
carried out by a trusted charitable agency such as the 
international committee of the red cross 
over the past several weeks us and united nations emissaries 
have failed to convince angolan authorities to show more 
flexibility 
the famine area has been afflicted both by drought and by 
prolonged fighting that resulted from a government offensive 
earlier this year 
the administration is prepared to be the major contributor if 
the angolan government agrees to an international relief effort 
officials said 
angola has been a sore point in eastwest relations for years 
while the united states has been supplying the rebels the soviet 
union and cuba have provided generous backing for the government 
cuba once had 50000 troops in angola but has begun a phased 
withdrawal that is expected to be completed next year 
one measure of the mistrust between the angolan government and 
unita was the breakdown of peace talks last week in lisbon 
portugal 
the negotiations collapsed after government negotiators refused 
a rebel demand for formal political recognition in advance of any 
ceasefire agreement 
this inflexible demand was designed intentionally to scuttle 
ceasefire negotiations said manuel pedro pacavira angolas 
un ambassador 
angolan authorities contend that the rebels sabotaged the talks 
in order to win congressional approval for additional us military 
aid 
unita president jonas savimbi said he was surprised and 
disappointed that angolan officials were not prepared to sign an 
agreement that would bring peace and democracy to angola 
as this was the purpose of this round of talks their behavior 
raises doubts about the sincerity of their intentions savimbi 
said

the prosecutor around here spends 
weekdays putting people in jail and weekends behind bars himself 
the sheriff meanwhile has lost his license for driving drunk 
law enforcement has become personal for the top cops in wyoming 
county situated in the coal country of southwestern west virginia 
in pineville the county seat that is home to 1100 of the 
countys 36000 residents nearly everyone knows everyone else so 
the legal woes of prosecutor paul butch goode and sheriff jim 
bolt keep tongues wagging 
my gut feeling is that most people dont like what they 
hear court clerk jack lambert said calling the situation an 
embarrassment 
at the pineville restaurant across from the courthouse owner 
bill adams disagreed 
ive known the bolt family for years his father was sheriff 
his father was chief of police him and his brother were raised 
here theyre good people adams said 
butch goode he was raised within 100 yards of my house i 
want to emphasize none of these people are crooks and i still have 
respect for both of them 
goode in may was placed on five years probation and ordered to 
serve 12 weekends in jail after he was convicted on federal charges 
of failing to file tax returns promptly the charges for 198285 
were misdemeanors 
bolt was convicted in state court in june of driving under the 
influence of alcohol another misdemeanor his license was revoked 
he faces sentencing sept 24 
under state law misdemeanor convictions do not disqualify 
public officials from holding office bolt and goode were elected 
and their terms run through 1992 
goode serves weekends in the taylor county jail about 200 miles 
to the north he also must pay 49949 in back taxes and a 10000 
fine a state bar association review that could result in his 
disbarment is in its early stages 
goode 52 did not return a call for comment he said previously 
that prosecutors singled him out because of his office not because 
of the severity of his crimes 
bolt 37 was arrested in beckley after he was spotted driving 
erratically in 1988 a test showed his bloodalcohol level at 018 
percent nearly twice the legal limit of 010 percent 
at his trial he contended that an intestinal disorder caused 
him to burp producing a false reading from a breathalyzer he said 
he hasnt decided whether to appeal 
sitting in his office bolt pointed out that he was elected in 
1988 after his arrest and said that he is tired of the attention 
it has attracted 
from the press youd think this was watergate he said 
bolt can regain his license after he completes a driver training 
course but he said the lack of a license hasnt hampered his 
ability to do his job which includes tax collection 
most of my work is done right here in the office or in the 
treasurers office he said if i need to go out on patrol 
ill ride with one of the deputies 
he said that people who supported him before the arrest continue 
to support him but that opponents are quick to conclude he 
ought to have his toes cut off and be hung up by his thumbs

us strategists look down every day on 
iraq and kuwait from a squadron of satellites that can spot tank 
tracks in the desert listen in on iraqi military commanders and 
give b52 bombers pinpoint accuracy 
the roundtheclock data relayed by at least 12 reconnaissance 
electronic intelligence earlywarning meteorological and 
navigation satellites orbiting high above the persian gulf could be 
decisive if the shooting starts in the confrontation with saddam 
hussein 
it gives the americans an astonishing technological edge over 
the iraqis who must find it disconcerting to know theyre being 
watched 24 hours a day like that said don kerr of londons 
international institute for strategic studies 
there is at least one electronic intelligence satellite 
probably a shuttledeployed magnum that can intercept telephone 
and radio communications in iraq and kuwait including those from 
saddam husseins headquarters to his field commanders and on down 
to interunit contacts 
analysts estimate that several smaller white cloud electronic 
intelligence or elint satellites put into orbit by titan 
missiles are being used over iraq and kuwait 
their signals are relayed through ground stations to britains 
topsecret general communications headquarters in cheltenham 
southwest england known as the puzzle palace which is linked 
to the us national security agency in maryland 
the capabilities are enormous kerr said in a telephone 
interview 
as well as satellites the americans have access to data 
garnered by british and israeli electronic surveillance operations 
in the middle east 
the british have sophisticated signals intelligence or sigint 
facilities on cyprus in the eastern mediterranean that intercept 
radio and telephone traffic around the middle east they funnel 
data back to cheltenham headquarters for relay to the national 
security agency 
all this winds up at the us military headquarters now 
established in saudi arabia to provide an hourbyhour intelligence 
picture for gen norman schwartzkopf commander of the 
everexpanding us military force confronting saddams legions 
polarorbiting keyhole kh11 highresolution 
opticalimaging reconnaissance satellites gave the americans the 
first evidence of iraqi military moves toward kuwait in late july 
several days before the aug 2 invasion 
kerr said there is at least one kh11 photo satellite orbiting 
as low as 180 miles over the northern persian gulf region it makes 
several passes a day a second satellite believed to be a more 
advanced kh12 is also reported to be in operation 
these satellites carry 12footlong cameras with enormous focal 
length that kerr said can take photos that provide great detail 
they can count tanks tents and even people on the ground 
the images are processed and stored on board as digital signals 
that are relayed to ground stations in the pacific and greenland 
for relay to washington 
the military satellite situation isnt as good as it might 
have been kerr said one kh12 launched by the space shuttle 
last year broke up in orbit 
the americans have a lacrosse radarimaging satellite at an 
altitude of 495 miles launched by a space shuttle in december 
1988 its radar can produce data in all weather although its image 
resolution is not as good as that of the opticalimaging systems 
there are believed to be at least six communications satellites 
operating in support of us forces in the region that give 
schwarzkopf direct links to the pentagon and the white house 
units in the field can talk to the pentagon if they need to 
kerr noted and these links are extremely difficult to jam 
there are navstar navigational satellites in 12400milehigh 
orbits that are used by us warships to provide pinpoint 
positioning 
kerr noted that providing troops have equipment to hook into 
these systems theyre perfect for travelling across the desert 
where navigation is difficult because of the lack of topographical 
features 
the highflying b52 bombers based on the indian ocean island of 
diego garcia 2100 miles east of the crisis zone could be 
equipped with navstar links 
that would in theory allow them to dump their 30ton bombloads 
with great accuracy although they were used in the vietnam war to 
carpetbomb targets 
kerr said navstar could give b52 navigators the capability to 
know their position to within 10 meters 33 feet a great 
asset in blind bombing which is probably a misnomer now 
the americans also have several earlywarning satellites that 
can detect missile launches analysts say at least one or two of 
these systems in geostationary orbit are being used to keep watch 
on iraqs missile batteries 
all these satellites produce a flood of photos and data around 
the clock that has to be processed before it can be useful 
kerr noted that the workload for us analysts in washington 
must be enormous they must be working flat out to sift through 
this data and analyze it to get as close to realtime intelligence 
as they can

the childrens defense fund says lax daycare 
laws in too many states amount to an inexcusable failure to protect 
the health and safety of the nations youngsters 
a report issued monday by the private organization urged support 
for legislation pending in congress that would provide 175 
billion in federal funds for child care require states to develop 
minimum requirements expand tax credits for lowincome working 
families and guarantee parents the right to make unannounced 
visits 
the fund said its national survey of childcare centers and 
daycare homes found that 13 states fail to require that children 
in day care be immunized against childhood diseases and 22 states 
do not require periodic fire drills 
thirty states do not insist that children 18 months and older in 
licensed childcare centers receive vaccine to protect them from 
meningitis and 24 states fail to require such centers to have 
energyabsorbing surfaces as a safety feature beneath swings 
slides and structures on which children climb 
the report said four states connecticut idaho indiana and 
south carolina failed to require that even one of those standards 
be met 
it said 19 states allow childcare centers to operate with five 
or more infants per adult although experts cited by the fund say 
one person should care for no more than three or four 
thirteen states it said allow one person to care for five or 
more infants or toddlers in family day care 
georgia and north carolina permit one person in a childcare 
center to care for up to seven infants while south carolina allows 
eight and idaho sets the limit at 12 the report said 
thirtythree states allow one person to care for more than 10 
4yearolds the limit is 18 in georgia and 20 in alabama florida 
north carolina south carolina and texas the fund said 
the report said more than 6 million children including more 
than 2 million who are younger than 3 spend part or all of their 
day in outofhome child care 
about half of those children are cared for by people providing 
family day care in their own homes 
most of those children are cared for in homes serving less than 
six youngsters the report said however it said 22 states exempt 
family daycare homes from regulation including inspections if 
they care for five or fewer unrelated youngsters 
twentynine states fully or partially exempt childcare programs 
operated by public schools from regulation although about 
onethird of childcare centers are operated by religious 
institutions 13 states fully or partially exempt such programs 
from licensing 
in 29 states parents do not have the unqualified right to visit 
their childs family daycare home unannounced the report said 
that denies parents the most meaningful opportunity to detect 
potential threats to their childs health and safety or to monitor 
the quality of care their child receives the fund said 
thirtyfive states do not require any type of training for staff 
in family daycare homes and 32 do not require specific levels of 
formal training for teachers in childcare centers the fund said 
it said only three states kentucky minnesota and wisconsin 
require specific levels of preservice and inservice training for 
childcare teachers and family day home providers and specify the 
level of training that providers must receive in each area

elevenyearold michael guadiello jr who 
uses a wheelchair because of muscular dystrophy calls a collie 
named ashley his independence dog and wants it to help at 
school 
administrators say no canines on campus 
michael has little use of his arms and legs ashley is a service 
dog trained to help with things like opening doors carrying 
packages and retrieving dropped objects 
the boy had attended special education classes at a school in 
the rose tree media school district where the dog was barred by 
administrators after michael obtained it in april 
district lawyer john steuerwald said officials objected because 
michaels educational program did not call for a dog and 
because there were no provisions for the animals care the 
district has no other student with a dog 
complicating the fight to get ashley admitted to the classroom 
was a decision by school officials that michael should be 
mainstreamed or attend class with nondisabled students in his 
home district of chichester 
the guadiello family opposes that move the boys parents say he 
needs the special education resources available only at rose tree 
in addition the chichester school is not equipped for wheelchair 
users 
on friday the state department of education issued a temporary 
ruling ordering michaels mainstreaming into chichesters middle 
school class begins wednesday 
state officials said the school must provide access to the 
building through such items as wheelchair ramps and offer trained 
people to help michael twice a day in using the bathroom 
michael said he was disgusted that officials think they can 
put his physical needs on a schedule he said his independence 
dog is all he needs 
the boys father and his wife jane say the decision illegally 
discriminates against their son they say that if he were blind 
the school would not have barred a guide dog 
the family is fighting the dog ban on another level because 
state law prohibits discriminating against handicapped people who 
use guide or service animals and specifically outlaws it in public 
schools said the guadiellos lawyer kyle burch 
the pennsylvania human relations commission has tried to settle 
the dispute the case brought before it is pending and wasnt 
affected by the state schools ruling which stands until a hearing 
sept 10 
ashley was trained for almost 19 months at a cost of 7229 
according to jean king of independence dogs of chadds ford which 
then sells the dogs for 150 to handicapped people like michael 
mrs guadiello said she was disappointed with the state schools 
ruling and would check chichesters compliance with the order 
before allowing michael to attend 
the collie frees michael from relying on friends and family 
members for help his mother said it is as necessary as michaels 
wheelchair and is not a pet she said that role is shared by the 
family terrier and a cat 
i slept on the floor of michaels room for 10 years because he 
was afraid he wouldnt be able to get out on his own if there was a 
fire said mrs guadiello as ashley rescued a dropped pencil for 
her son but with ashley here im back in my own room

a study commissioned by the chairman of the 
house banking committee found that the federal reserve has only a 
handful of women or minorities serving in top policymaking jobs 
despite a 1977 law requiring diversity of membership and public 
participation on the fed boards consumers labor unions small 
business executives and farmers have little representation 
according to the committee staff report ordered by rep henry b 
gonzales dtexas 
twothirds of the board of directors for each of the 12 regional 
fed banks are elected by commercial banks in each area that belongs 
to the fed system 
there are only three women among the 72 directors of regional 
fed banks selected by commercial bankers in each region and all but 
two of the 72 are white the house survey reported there is one 
black and one asian american 
there are no representatives of consumer groups or labor 
organizations among the 72 bankelected directors seventyseven 
percent of those directors are either current or former commercial 
bankers the report said 
the other onethird of the directors are appointed by the 
sevenmember federal reserve board 
the report said the fed whose members are appointed by the 
president has a disappointing record on the question of diversity 
current fed governor martha seger is only the second woman to serve 
on the fed board and there are no minorities 
the 36 regional board members appointed by the fed board are 
still heavily drawn from the ranks of white males with connections 
to banking or big business the report said 
seventyseven percent of the fed boards appointments are white 
and 83 percent are male half the feds appointments are former 
bankers while none comes from consumer organizations or labor 
unions the study said 
most of the federal reserve directors are drawn from the ranks 
of big business and banking gonzalez said in a statement you 
have to question whether people working in the highfalutin world of 
high finance and business can really understand the impact higher 
interest rates have on the average workers purchasing power and 
job security 
federal reserve spokesman bob moore said officials at the 
central bank had not received the house report and would have no 
comment until they had a chance to review it 
gonzalez dtexas has been a longtime critic of the federal 
reserve but his elevation to committee chairman last year has 
given him a powerful forum from which to direct his attack

iraqis hardened by eight years of war with 
iran seem almost casual about the formidable buildup of us 
firepower across the border in saudi arabia 
there is some concern about the embargo on trade with iraq 
ordered by the united nations after baghdad seized kuwait and some 
suspicions about the causes of the crisis 
but there is no smell of war along the noisy bustling avenues 
of this ancient capital 
instead iraqis willing to talk with western reporters view the 
threat of war with a mixture of bravado and arab fatalism 
what can i do about it shrugged mahdi kathom a 30yearold 
vegetable vendor in central baghdad if it happens it is because 
god lets it happen there is nothing to do about it 
god willing our president will solve this said one 
middleaged woman who declined to give her name saddam hussein 
is a strong and wise man 
many iraqis question the motives of president bush in sending 
troops and warplanes to saudi arabia but a few speaking privately 
in this rigidly controlled society say they are suspicious about 
their own leader and his reasons for provoking the crisis 
some say saddam underestimated the us reaction and a few 
others voice suspicions that he triggered the crisis partly to 
challenge the americans and raise his standing in the arab world 
for eight years saddam told his people they were fighting iran 
for control over the shatt alarab waterway that spills into the 
northern persian gulf 
then on aug 12 just 10 days after the invasion of kuwait 
saddam acknowledged irans claim to shared sovereignty over the 
waterway that some iraqis believe they bought with the blood of 
their loved ones 
saddams peace overture secured his vulnerable eastern border 
freeing troops to confront the us buildup 
some iraqis say they now wonder why saddam gave in on the 
waterway and why he chose to invade kuwait 
but while a few quietly mumble their suspicions iraqis who 
spoke openly defended the invasion and occupation of the country 
they have long considered a part of iraq wrongfully separated from 
the motherland by british colonial rulers 
forget kuwait it is a dream there is no kuwait said one 
baghdad taxi driver 
a few iraqis said they have heard frightening assessments of 
american military might on foreign radio broadcasts by the british 
broadcasting corp and voice of america 
but the statecontrolled press has focused on dissent in the 
west against the sanctions and the troop buildup the iraqi press 
also has disparaged the ability of us troops to fight against 
battlehardened iraqis in the desert 
near the center of baghdad stands the monument of saddams 
qaddissiya martyrs a tribute to the dead of the iraniraq war 
named after babylons victory over the persians in 600 bc 
the marble monument covered with aqua tiles is in the form of 
two halves of an islamic dome it is split to symbolize the islamic 
tradition that the dome of the mosque opens to allow martyrs to 
ascend to heaven 
it is one of the many military monuments in baghdad another is 
made from the wreckage of an iranian war plane shot down over the 
city 
madria nasser abdul almishadani a 40yearold woman walking 
near the qaddissiya monument said iraqi women are not afraid their 
loved ones will be killed in another war 
the women are not afraid arent we iraqis why should we be 
scared she asked 
why is the united states so upset over the invasion of 
kuwait 
the united states had less right to go into panama than we had 
to go into kuwait she added we have tried to get kuwait back 
for 30 years 
a man walking near the monument 40yearold salem kalaf said 
that during the war with iran people got used to hardships such as 
the reduced consumption that the un trade embargo might bring 
again 
we know about war we saw missiles hit our homes and our 
stores and we lived through that he said 
the government indicated it will start rationing the sale of 
some basic foods in the next few days but it insisted the measure 
was a precaution because of the sanctions and not a response to 
shortages 
some lines have already formed outside bakeries for bread but 
while some say privately they are worried about shortages most 
iraqis like kalaf say publicly they are prepared to endure more 
hardships 
i am not afraid our country is strong and we can handle 
this said mohammed hussein a 47yearold baghdad resident who 
said two of his sons were with the army in kuwait 
i want to tell the american people that their president is not 
listening to us we want peace said ahmed abdallah a 
54yearold baghdad resident 
it appears that most people do not want a war with iraq if 
america is a democratic country then bush should listen to what 
the people are saying

men join the student body at tiny 
colbysawyer college today for the first time in more than 60 years 
marches sitins and the seizure of an administration building 
by protesters ensued after trustees voted 221 in april 1989 to 
open the school to men 
but a mood of acceptance prevailed as students arrived for the 
start of the fall semester at the 525student college with many 
women welcoming their 79 new male classmates 
maria francesconi a junior nursing major from cheshire mass 
said she accepts the change although she demonstrated against it 
last year 
we all had the summer to adjust she said theres a lot 
less anger here and a lot more excitement now 
freshman dean heide of ringoes nj said hes comfortable at 
his new school 
my biggest fear was that we wouldnt be wanted he said 
but after talking to the girls im not worried 
colbysawyer president peggy stock said money worries made the 
change necessary 
looking 10 years down the road at the number of women we would 
be able to draw from we said were in trouble stock said 
it was an emotional decision but it was the right decision for 
us 
colbysawyer which admitted men from 1837 to 1928 plans to 
have equal numbers of men and women by 1995 twentynine percent of 
this years 240 freshmen are men and 12 of 40 transfers are male 
the school had a 120 percent increase in applicants last year 
and fundraising also is up stock said 
most alumni and students have accepted the change she said she 
added that 91 percent of students scheduled to return did so and 
few left solely because of coeducation 
other schools in similar situations havent had it so easy 
at 1200student wheaton college in norton mass which became 
coeducational in 1988 some alumni took the school to court to get 
back their donations they said they wouldnt have donated if they 
had known the school planned to admit men they won and 56 shared 
a 127300 refund 
last year at mills college in east oakland calif students 
crippled the school with protests and boycotts after trustees voted 
to admit men as undergraduates two weeks later the trustees backed 
down 
some men said they chose colbysawyer because of its size 
academic reputation and picturesque campus about 40 miles from 
concord a short drive from ski areas lakes and mountains 
dan hancock of lancaster said he also wanted to be part of 
history 
i wanted to be able to look back in 20 years and know i was 
part of this that i helped build it he said

iraq has poured its citizens into 
kuwait to try to intimidate local residents and may settle 
thousands in the captive nation kuwaiti government ministers say 
the ministers said monday that iraq is continuing to pillage 
their country but added that civil disobedience and some armed 
resistance has succeeded in making the iraqi army uneasy about 
taking over certain areas 
planning minister suleiman almuttawa claimed iraqi president 
saddam hussein has bought whatever support he has in the arab world 
the minister accused saddam of paying billions of dollars to 
regional leaders including yasser arafat of the palestine 
liberation organization and jordans king hussein to take his side 
the comments came as the cabinet of the kuwaiti 
governmentinexile prepared for a series of meetings with top 
western officials over the persian gulf crisis 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd was expected in this 
southwestern mountain resort today and is to meet secretary of 
state james a baker iii for talks on friday 
almuttawa said baker would meet with kuwaits emir sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah whose governmentinexile set up headquarters in 
this city after iraq overran kuwait on aug 2 
the minister said the agenda for the talks was not fixed but he 
expected it to center on the multibilliondollar bill for deploying 
the massive us force in the region 
the bush administration has indicated it expects contributions 
from west germany japan and the wealthy oil states of the persian 
gulf 
almuttawa said kuwait would make whatever military efforts it 
could but added that its most successful means of combating the 
iraqis was a civil disobedience campaign 
the passive resistance is very effective he said there 
is no cooperation by the kuwaiti citizens with the invading forces 
which is annoying the iraqis because they thought their soldiers 
would be welcomed 
almuttawa said a latin americanstyle guerrilla movement was 
not possible in his country because it has no back country to 
shelter a large guerrilla force and no real military tradition 
this is a flat country where anybody who walks along can be 
picked up miles away he said 
but armed attacks have been useful in dissuading iraqis from 
entering residential neighborhoods out of fear they would be shot 
he said 
the planning minister said iraq was trying to move some of its 
citizens into residential areas as part of a psychological warfare 
campaign to convince kuwaitis that their country is part of iraq 
he said he doubted iraqi families would want to move into such a 
hostile environment 
housing minister yahia fahd said there was some concern that 
saddam would eventually move hundreds of thousands of iraqis into 
the country effectively outnumbering the kuwaiti population 
the ministers said 240000 kuwaitis had fled to neighboring gulf 
countries and that tens of thousands more were in other middle 
eastern countries europe and north america at the time of the 
invasion 
the total number of kuwaitis is put at about 600000 but 
foreign workers brought the countrys population up to 17 million 
fahd said saddams plan was to hold a referendum after 
largescale iraqi resettlement in kuwait and then claim the kuwaiti 
people wanted to be annexed to iraq a move decreed aug 6 
information minister sheik jaber mubarak alsabah said the 
iraqis in the past few days had dismantled television broadcast 
facilities traffic lights and even street lights and carted them 
off to iraq 
almuttawa said the government had no estimate of the value of 
goods stolen from kuwait

mark tuckers tee shot on the 
dogleg par 4 third hole plopped down right where he wanted it in 
the sand 
the next shot was a tough one there was little room behind the 
green and a shot too long would land out of bounds 
but tucker again was near perfect dropping the ball just to the 
left of the green in the sand 
welcome to golf desert style where every shot or at least 
every good shot lands in the sand 
even the greens the locals call them browns are sand packed 
hard by rollers and made into a claylike substance by spraying 
them with the areas most abundant substance next to sand oil a 
sign at the first hole warns golfers no spikes shoes allowed on 
greens 
you cant play this course with clubs and balls alone every 
player carries a small square of plastic grass placing it under 
the ball after every shot to provide a notsolush green surface to 
hit off 
tucker played a round of golf monday with a reporter who had 
spotted the course while flying over it in a helicopter most golf 
courses are tucked into the woods or alongside a lake this one is 
between a huge military airbase and rows of oil storage tanks 
the rolling hills country club is one of the many recreation 
facilities offered to employees of saudi aramco the huge oil 
company in the northeast saudi desert 
it is something else isnt it tucker said during a 
ninehole round monday the complex has 27 holes split between the 
east west and south courses these course were built in the 1970s 
but there has been golf at aramco since not long after the company 
was established 50 years ago 
theres a driving range too and a club where golfers much 
like their counterparts back in the states can grab a burger and 
beer after a round here however the beer is the nonalcoholic 
tucker asked to compare desert golf to the game back home 
misses the beer more than the grass 
its more fun to drive around in the cart with beer says the 
michigan native an aramco land surveyor who now owns a place in 
montana he visits for about a month each year 
the wind on the aramco course is fierce drives that begin 
straight can get carried 20 yards or more off target and in a game 
in which concentration is said to be the key to success a 
screaming f15 takeoff at the airbase down the hill can be more 
than a bit unnerving 
you get used to it said tucker 
about the only elements of this golf course that recall other 
courses of the world are the sandtraps but even they are a bit 
different 
when tucker dropped a shot into a trap short of the green he 
didnt reach for a wedge the sandtraps here are circled with 
asphalt providing a hardenend ramplike lip so tucker used his 
putter slapping the ball into the slope and up onto the green 
the shot was unconventional but effective 
thats one of our only in dhahran shots tucker said with a 
grin they take practice

less than two months before 
national elections prime minister geoffrey palmer resigned today 
after polls indicated the governing labor party would be routed 
with him at its helm 
labor chose external relations and trade minister mike moore to 
head the government and tackle the daunting task of turning around 
the party before the oct 27 balloting palmer took office 13 
months ago after defeating moore in a party vote to replace david 
lange as prime minister 
the latest polls show the opposition national party with a 
2to1 or more lead over labor although many voters say they have 
not made up their minds 
under labor leadership since 1984 new zealand has undergone a 
wideranging economic transformation with many stateowned 
businesses being sold off 
but the electorate is unhappy with the ailing economy inflation 
is at 76 percent shortterm interest rates at nearly 15 percent 
and unemployment has reached 73 percent 
moore 41 who in recent months repeatedly denied he would seek 
to unseat palmer told a news conference that new zealanders wanted 
a new direction and that his bid for the leadership in no way 
is a reflection on mr palmers service to new zealand 
palmer 48 had denied he would step down as recently as monday 
new zealand press association quoted sources as saying he had 
support to stay on but that he quit because infighting would have 
devastated the embattled party 
palmer told reporters he may well have had the numbers to 
remain but i took the view that to have a leadership contest on a 
vote would be destructive it would be divisive that it was not in 
the best interests of the collective 
the need for a feeling of unity is paramount at this time and 
that feeling of unity will have been restored by my decision he 
said 
asked if he thought moore had a greater chance of winning the 
election he said i certainly hope that he has 
palmer apparently will leave politics altogether he said he 
would not seek reelection to parliament although he agreed to 
stay on as environment minister a noncabinet position through 
the election 
national party leader jim bolger said it was quite 
irrelevant who was prime minister going into the election 
many labor candidates concerned about palmers dwindling 
popularity hurting their chances for election have been been 
running campaign ads without the labor logo 
a radio new zealand poll in late july showed the conservative 
nationals leading by a 46 percent to 21 percent margin over labor 
however polls have shown moore leading all candidates for prime 
minister and he was the clear choice in a survey of business chief 
executives 
some political commentators say labor is in serious danger of 
losing 20 of the 56 seats it holds in the 97seat parliament 
the nationals hold 40 seats in parliament and the breakaway 
leftwing new labor party has one the 5monthold green party has 
been running third in opinion polls 
but many voters remained undecided including many traditional 
labor supporters opinion polls in some areas have put the 
undecided vote at 38 percent to 47 percent 
labor took power in 1984 ousting the nationals it won 
reelection in 1987 despite losing some support because of its 
deregulation policies 
palmer defeated moore for the prime ministers job after lange 
resigned in august 1989 for health reasons he had undergone heart 
surgery the year before 
langes leadership had also been under challenge because of 
party wrangling over the pace and direction of the former finance 
minister roger douglas program of deregulating the economy 
lange had been one of new zealands most popular leaders 
particularly earning admiration for his nonuclear stance in 
refusing to allow us warships to dock in new zealand because they 
would not confirm or deny whether they were carrying nuclear 
weapons 
both palmer and moore represent districts in christchurch the 
largest city on new zealands south island 
moore became the youngest person ever elected to parliament when 
he won his first seat in 1972 at age 23 he was ousted in 1975 in 
labors landslide loss but returned three years later

the governing party which has run mexico for 
60 years has pledged polticial reforms ranging from recognition of 
churches to citizen participation in the selection of party 
candidates 
we have achieved a new democracy institutional 
revolutionary party president luis donaldo colosio said at a 
closing speech monday before 9000 delegates to the partys 
threeday 14th national assembly 
the party known as pri has dominated mexican politics since it 
was founded in 1929 its presidential candidates have traditionally 
been chosen by their predecessors and only in the past two 
elections has there been any public discussion on the matter 
the government has also refused to legally recognize churches 
which may not own land clergymnen may not vote still 
anticlerical laws are widely ignored in this intensely catholic 
country and the government has twice played host to pope john paul 
ii 
in one resolution the party called for separation of 
religious and political affairs and equal treatment of all 
public manifestations of religion 
but the most important reforms adopted by the assembly dealt 
with change in the selection of candidates at all levels giving 
control over the process to local party organizations the reforms 
did not however spell out how citizens would participate in 
candidate selection 
the democratic reforms had strong backing from president carlos 
salinas de gortari who has described such political changes as an 
essential part of his program to modernize the mexican economy and 
political system 
colosio told delegates that the party must adapt to a changing 
mexican society and confront the threat of electoral losses 
from now on any militant that wants to be a candidate will 
have to face first the judgement of his fellow citizens colosio 
told delegates 
in 1988 salinas won with just over 50 percent of the vote the 
smallest margin in party history and the party suffered its first 
senate losses leftist parties gained ground in the central part of 
the country defeating salinas in the federal district and a few 
states 
in 1989 the party lost its first governors race conceding 
victory to the conservative national action party in baja 
california 
the party is preparing for crucial city elections in the state 
of mexico which includes most of the mexico city suburbs it is 
also readying itself for 1991 midterm congressional elections 
in another resolution membership in the allpowerful central 
committee was cut from 37 to nine and the influence of party 
peasant and labor organizations in the committee was reduced 
the pri also appealed to private businessmen to join in the 
countrys efforts at modernization 
the mexican entrepreneur the party said must be 
innovative take chances and work together with other sectors of 
society 
another reform that brought applause from delegates was a 
recommendation that political trials be instituted for corrupt 
government officials 
outgoing government officials with reputations for corruption 
have traditionally been exempted from legal action in the last two 
administrations however several officials have been jailed the 
highest of them being the director of the government oil monopoly 
salinas told the delegates he was proud to be a member of the 
new party 
the reforms are not to satisfy our enemies but to create a 
better society salinas said their purpose is to maintain the 
mexican revolution in power they are changes to win votes 
democratically they are changes for victory not to give away 
power

yen from mondays finish after opening at 14380 yen it ranged

fuji bank

avenue after starting to chase the fleeing thieves davis said

crime it was the 18th killing in the citys subways this year in 
watkins hometown one homicide was recorded for all of 1989 provo 
police records secretary bobbie ferguson said 
the watkins family tennis fans who have visited new york for

several smaller persian gulf states are 
shedding a traditional reluctance for close military links with the 
united states and allowing us combat airplanes on their bases 
pentagon sources say 
its very important to the united states that our aircraft be 
able to operate out of these nations in the persian gulf one 
source said monday 
this source said defense secretary dick cheney was able to 
negotiate a variety of agreements with the nations on the 
arabian peninsula during his trip there last month 
asked to comment on the report during an appearance on abcs 
good morning america cheney said today he would not go 
countrybycountry in detailing which ones have accepted what 
us forces but said all are participating to one degree or 
another the exact degree varies 
cheney said some of the countries are sensitive about 
acknowledging the presence of us forces but said it was fair to 
say there is more cooperation than there has ever been before 
asked whether the presence of us forces amounts to an implicit 
commitment to also defend those countries cheney said i think 
it does 
because of the threat posed by iraqi forces because of saddam 
husseins invasion of kuwait a month ago saudi arabia the united 
arab emirates and qatar have allowed us warplanes to operate on 
their soil 
cheney was able to extend those relationships to include other 
persian gulf states such as bahrain and oman as well said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the sources did not 
have specifics on their aircraft deployment 
some nations have allowed for refueling rights others have 
allowed for the stationing of aircraft and others have allowed 
cargo operations 
bahrain has agreed to accept marine fa18 attack planes a6 
attack aircraft av8 harrier jets and ea6 electronic jamming 
planes the new york times reported in todays editions 
in addition the united states deployed a sizeable number of 
f16 fighters in the united arab emirates the newspaper reported 
also the united states has f15e ground attack planes based in 
oman the times reported 
the united states already has acknowledged stationing a squadron 
of f16c fighter planes in qatar 
cheney reached the agreement with saudi arabia to allow for the 
stationing of us troops on saudi soil in a meeting with king fahd 
just days after the iraqi invasion of kuwait he returned to the 
persian gulf two weeks after the invasion to help fortify arab 
support against iraq in discussions with the leaders of bahrain 
oman qatar the united arab emirates egypt and saudi arabia 
those countries warmed toward military cooperation with the 
united states during the eightyear war between iran and iraq when 
us warships protected kuwaiti tankers from iranian attack in the 
persian gulf

birds released from cages was american as apple pie one 
advocate said but dozens of animalrights activists didnt agree 
and clashed with shooters 
three state troopers suffered minor injuries and 25 people were 
arrested during the 57th annual fred coleman memorial shoot at 
hegins 40 miles northeast of harrisburg 
several fistfights broke out a skunk was thrown at protesters 
and a demonstrator kicked out the windshield of a car 
animalrights activists from pennsylvania california maryland 
kansas illinois new jersey west virginia virginia texas and 
florida picketed the allday community fundraiser billed as the 
largest live pigeon shoot in the world 
competitors using shotguns stood about 20 yards from the birds 
which were released one at a time from cages 
after a group of birds was shot a group of young trapper 
boys ran onto the field to retrieve them some birds were only 
wounded and the children would wring their necks or pull their 
heads off dead birds were collected to be used in fertilizer 
shooters said 
an estimated 4800 birds were killed monday organizers said 
this is as american as apple pie and chevrolet said one 
burly man wearing a jack daniels baseball cap theres a lot 
more worse things than this go to saudi arabia and protest the oil 
prices 
its deplorable that these men get their kicks out of this 
said paula murphy an elementary school teacher from ashland 
fourteen animal activists with fake blood dripping from their 
mouths charged onto the field at different times attempting to free 
the caged birds spectators chanted shoot as state police tried 
to handcuff the demonstrators 
the people who rushed the field were charged with criminal 
trespass an additional 11 demonstrators were charged with 
disorderly conduct 
state police spokesman tom lyon said police ordered the 
protesters to leave because it was just getting out of control 
the event has a history of drawing protests and lyon said 40 
officers were assigned and a state police helicopter was called in 
as an extra show of force 
community members jeered shouted obscenities and homosexual 
slurs at the demonstrators they said the activists should leave 
them alone because the shoot is legal 
shooter jack keating said the shoot is simply killing rats 
with wings 
protesters carried signs that read small men big guns 
stop the slaughter and killing for fun is sick 
community members retaliated with tshirts and pickets of their 
own kill them all let god sort them out and let feathers 
fly and freedom ring

boris yeltsin president of the russian republic 
has come up with a plan that would give the republics control of 
their economies and drastically reduce the power of the national 
government 
russia gives the impulse for change to the entire country 
yeltsin told his legislature monday the center can no longer 
ignore this and discard everything done by us 
if approved by the russian republics legislature the proposal 
would dramatically constrict the power of president mikhail s 
gorbachev yeltsins rival gorbachevs national government would 
control only a fraction of the planned transition from communism to 
a market economy 
yeltsin set an ambitious schedule calling for five days of 
debate in the russian legislature and a vote on the fundamental 
reform sept 11 that agenda would leave the national legislature 
in the dust because it does not open its session until sept 10 
according to a copy of the 250page plan obtained by the 
associated press most decisions regarding the economy would be 
made by the 15 sovereign republics 
under it russia would legalize private ownership of land and 
give away huge numbers of stateowned apartments and residential 
lots to try to solve critical shortages of food and housing 
since russia contains half of the soviet unions people and 
threequarters of its land mass the national legislature would be 
unable to ignore a decision by russia to embark on a more radical 
reform than favored by gorbachev 
but yeltsin said gorbachev is increasingly willing to understand 
the republics proposals and act together a joint 
gorbachevyeltsin economic commission was scheduled to meet today 
to try to forge a single plan that could be adopted by both the 
russian and soviet parliaments yeltsin said 
so far gorbachev has favored combining parts of the russian 
proposal with a purely economic program suggested by soviet prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov 
pravda said today that gorbachev has appointed soviet deputy 
prime minister lev voronin to head a task force to deal with the 
most urgent economic emergencies the faltering soviet economy is 
plagued by shortages of everything from cigarettes to gasoline 
under yeltsins plan the soviet governments duties would 
eventually be limited to such matters as defense strengthening the 
nearly worthless ruble and providing disaster relief it would lose 
the power to tax and would have to rely on dues from the republics 
yeltsin said his program has the support of the other soviet 
republics since it would give them vast new powers his plan is 
dubbed 500 days for the time it provides to switch to a market 
economy it calls for immediate action on reforms that gorbachevs 
government has only mentioned or postponed years into the future 
people will be given the opportunity to participate actively 
in the economy to buy bakeries laundries stores repair shops 
and other things that the future state should not bother with 
said russian prime minister ivan silaev in introducing the plan to 
the legislature 
before the end of the year the selloff of such stateowned 
businesses would begin the plan said apartments and residential 
lots would be given away or sold for merely symbolic prices 
laws that punish entrepreneurs would be eliminated the proposal 
said currently it is illegal to make a profit selling an item 
manufactured by someone elses labor

pope john paul ii today urged africas 
roman catholics to abandon the unspeakable crime of witchcraft 
a practice that threatens the churchs foundations on the continent 
in his homily at an outdoor mass on the shores of lake victoria 
the pope also spoke out against abortion saying the dignity of 
every human person from the moment of conception until natural 
death must be respected 
his sermon came on the fourth day of his seventh visit to 
africa a vast continent with a declining economy and a soaring 
birth rate that is expected to double its population of 500 million 
within 20 years 
tanzanias average per capita annual income is only about 200 
making it one of the worlds poorest countries few of subsaharan 
africas 48 other nations fare much better 
the pope also condemned artificial birth control calling it 
contrary to the truth of married love by which husband and wife 
become cooperators with god in giving life 
concerned about their birth rates and their lack of resources to 
adequately care for swelling populations tanzania and many other 
african nations actively support birth control programs 
john paul said respect for human dignity also is threatened in 
africa by the practice of uchawi or witchcraft he said it leads 
practioners into forms of enslavement and false worship 
he also criticized the traditional african custom of mahari or 
a dowry payment by a husband to the family of his bride in the 
past these payments usually took the form of cattle sheep and 
goats increasingly they involve substantial cash payments 
the pope said there are many authentic and praiseworthy human 
values associated with the dowry tradition but he asked do 
not excesses and abuses of these customs lead to attitudes which 
judge the dignity and worth of persons only on the basis of wealth 
and possessions 
the roman catholic church in africa only a century old faces 
the problem of incorporating traditional practices in the liturgy 
without overwhelming the faiths traditions and beliefs 
the church has gone a long way in recent years in the process of 
africanization adopting the use of tribal drums native dance 
music and language in the liturgy 
the pope has encouraged the process while warning that the basic 
tenents of catholic faith and teaching cannot be compromised he 
has stressed the churchs laws on polygamy superstition and 
priestly celebacy on his current visit 
an estimated 50000 faithful attended the mass on a hillside 
above mwanza a relatively prosperous cottongrowing and 
goldmining center on the southern shores of the worlds third 
largest lake 
nineteen married couples repeated their marriage vows before the 
pope he also gave first communion to a group of children dressed 
in white finery 
as he neared the halfway point of his 10day trip the pope 
ended the day in moshi a farming and resort city on the southern 
slopes of snowcapped mount kilimanjaro at 18864 feet the tallest 
mountain in africa 
his pilgrimage will take him to tiny burundi on wednesday then 
on to neighboring and equally small rwanda 
he ends his visit on sept 10 in the west african nation of 
ivory coast where he will consecrate a massive 133 million 
basilica

the prime ministers of north and south 
korea met today and prepared for historic talks intended to ease 
four decades of military and political tensions both expressed 
hopes for a new era in their relations 
it is the highestlevel contact between the rivals since the 
division of the korean peninsula in 1945 although the prime 
ministers hold largely ceremonial posts and their roles in 
policymaking are limited 
people expect to reap much from the talks south korean 
president roh taewoo said today but the task of national 
unification should take a stepbystep approach just like eating a 
bowl of rice one spoonful at a time 
the visit got off to a bit of a bumpy start students in seoul 
staged an antigovernment demonstration and the north korean 
leaders motorcade was involved in an accident immediately after 
crossing the border he was not hurt 
also the north koreans had barely arrived when they asked to 
speak to south korean dissidents and to visit the families of two 
clergymen and a student jailed for illegally traveling to the north 
the seoul government has taken a firm stand against allowing its 
citizens to talk directly with north korean officials and it 
brushed aside the request 
they should concentrate on the talks said south korean 
unification minister hong sungchul 
at a gala banquet on the eve of the talks however all was 
cordial 
i am so glad that you have taken the challenge of blazing an 
unbeaten trail through the thicket to come here south korean 
prime minister kang younghoon told his north korean counterpart 
yon hyong muk 
if only we build confidence in each other by meeting again and 
again we should be able to generate sufficient heat to thaw the 
thick ice of distrust said kang a soldierturneddiplomat born 
in the north who fled to the south before the 195053 korean war 
yon a sovieteducated technocrat said after crossing the 
border for the first time i realize its easy 
the north korean was warmly greeted in the lobby of the hotel 
where talks were to be held welcome shouted several hundred 
onlookers outside the hotel some waved and applauded 
as the premiers motorcade approached the hotel two students 
managed to unfold a banner within view but were quickly shoved 
aside by police eight radical students were arrested trying to 
take a unification banner to the border police said 
another 200 radical students staged a violent antigovernment 
clash with combat clad riot police at seouls korea university 
down with roh taewoo students yelled hurling firebombs 
during a twohour fight police fired volleys of tear gas to drive 
students inside the campus witnesses said the students appeared to 
avoid chants which might be offensive toward north korea no 
injuries were immediately reported 
the north korean leader escaped injury shortly after he crossed 
the border when the car in which he was riding was involved in a 
collision with three other cars on the way to the hotel 
the accident occured when a civilian car tried to cut through 
the motorcade as it drove through downtown seoul two north korean 
diplomats riding in separate cars were treated for minor injuries 
one car caught fire and the windshield on the third was broken 
the meeting marks the first time both sides recognize the 
legitimacy of each others governments south korean officials say 
previously north korea had refused to recognize the seoul 
government 
most south koreans however reacted coolly to the talks south 
koreans have been disappointed by repeated failures of the korean 
governments to make progress in such encounters 
the north korean delegation included the prime minister six 
other official delegates to the talks 33 aides and 50 north korean 
reporters all wore lapel badges with pictures of north korean 
dictator kim il sung 
they smiled and waved as they walked across the border at the 
truce village of panmunjom the first group to cross since 1985 and 
only the third delegation since the end of world war ii 
young women in colorful long traditional dresses bowed and 
children presented flowers 
if all goes well a second round of talks is to be held in north 
koreas capital of pyongyang in midoctober 
the border between the koreas remains the most heavily fortified 
in the world with more than 15 million armed men on either side 
there is no travel mail or other communication between civilians 
of the two sides

arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi 
has quit highlighting a split within the organization over the 
persian gulf crisis league officials said today a lebanese will 
act as interim secretarygeneral 
klibi 66 a tunisian announced his surprise resignation as 
head of the 21member body late monday he had held the job for 11 
years 
assaad elassaad a lebanese and the 70yearold doyen of the 
arab leagues deputy chiefs will act as interim secretarygeneral 
the officials said the new secretarygeneral must be chosen by a 
twothirds vote among league members 
klibis resignation highlights divisions within the arab league 
over the gulf crisis as well as the groups decision to move the 
league headquarters from tunis back to cairo its original seat 
klibi had been the arab leagues secretary general since 1979 
when the organization moved to tunis he was reappointed to the 
post in march for another fiveyear term 
the league has been openly divided since its aug 10 arab summit 
in cairo over the persian gulf crisis which was precipitated by 
iraqs aug 2 seizure of kuwait 
the summit condemned iraq and agreed to send a token arab force 
to bolster american troops defending saudi arabia from any move by 
iraq to seize more territory 
tunisia boycotted the summit provoking anger from egypt and 
saudi arabia the most vocal arab nations in their opposition to 
the iraqi invasion 
while more than half the league members took what was viewed as 
a prowestern stance others sided in varying degrees with iraq 
it was klibis job to reconcile the two camps but at a meeting 
of arab league foreign ministers last week saudi minister prince 
saud alfaisal was sharply critical of the secretarygeneral 
in addition klibi has been caught in a battle over the location 
of the leagues headquarters which was moved to tunis after egypt 
declared peace with israel in 1979 and was barred from the league 
the decision to move the headquarters back to the egyptian 
capital has provoked protests from iraq iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz criticized the move because of what he called egypts 
partial attitude against iraq 
some have charged that klibi himself has resisted the move to 
cairo 
a meeting of arab league ministers has been called for sept 10 
in cairo where the transfer of the leagues headquarters back to 
cairo will be officially announced

about one in four us households was hit by a 
violent or property crime last year a slight increase from the 
previous few years but still substantially lower than the rate 
during the 1970s 
during the last five years the percentage of households 
victimized by crime has remained level at about 25 percent said 
steven dillingham director of the justice departments bureau of 
justice statistics 
in 1975 when this statistical series commenced about one in 
three households was struck by crime he said 
the bureaus figures come from the national crime survey which 
annually interviews members of 49000 households nationwide to 
determine crimes against household members who are at least 12 
years old the ncs does not check for murder because it compiles 
its information from surveys of victims 
the portion of households that suffered from a violent or 
property crime ranged from 32 percent in 1975 to 30 percent at the 
start of the 1980s and gradually tapered off to a low of 245 
percent in 1987 according to the report 
the actual percentage of households that suffered a violent or 
property crime last year was 249 percent up slightly from 246 
percent in 1988 according to the report released sunday the 
figures include attempted as well as completed crimes 
a total of 235 million households was victimized by one of the 
crimes checked rape assault robbery personal theft household 
theft burglary and motor vehicle theft 
a total of 49 percent of households experienced a violent 
crime with 39 percent suffering assault 1 percent robbery and 
01 percent rape the survey found the year before violent crime 
had hit 48 percent of homes 
meanwhile 178 percent of households suffered from some kind of 
theft 112 percent personal theft and 81 percent household theft 
51 percent suffered from a burglary and 16 percent motor vehicle 
theft 
the survey found that as in previous years black households 
urban households and households with higher incomes suffered a 
higher percentage of crimes last year 
a total of 291 percent of all black households suffered from 
any ncssurveyed crime a slight increase from 29 percent in 1988 
and 64 percent of them suffered from a violent crime a decrease 
from 66 percent in 1988 
as for households headed by caucasians 243 percent suffered 
from an ncssurveyed crime up from 239 percent the previous year 
and 47 percent were victimized by a violent crime a slight 
increase from 46 in 1988 
some 255 percent of the households of other races combined 
asians pacific islanders and native americans were victimized by 
an ncssurveyed crime down from 274 percent in 1988 the 
percentage of those homes that suffered from a violent crime also 
decreased to 54 percent from 56 percent 
a separate category for hispanics and nonhispanics shows that a 
greater percentage of hispanic households suffered an ncs crime 
last year than in 1988 last year 338 percent of households 
headed by hispanics were victims of an ncs crime up from 30 
percent the previous year meanwhile 73 percent of hispanic 
households suffered a violent crime up from 65 percent in 1988 
the percentage of urban households that have been victims of 
crime increased from 303 percent to 312 percent a greater number 
of suburban households also were victimized up from 238 percent 
to 242 percent at the same time rural households experienced 
less crime with only 172 percent suffering compared with 18 
percent in 1988 
the portion of households with incomes of 15000 and above that 
suffered from a crime edged downward last year while crime hit a 
larger portion of households with lower incomes than it had in 
1988 still the households with the highest target rate 27 
percent were those with incomes of 25000 or more

finance minister yitzhak modai said today that 
if the united states goes ahead with proposals to forgive egypts 
multibillion dollar debt israel will demand that most of its debt 
to the americans also be erased 
egypt owes the united states 67 billion from previous arms 
sales and israel owes 46 billion the two are the largest 
recipients of us foreign aid each year israel receives 3 
billion and egypt gets 23 billion 
it doesnt make sense that egypt gets a waiver and israel 
stays out of it modai told israel radio it is ridiculous 
he said he would raise the subject when he visits washington in 
two weeks 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said he hoped israel would receive 
additional economic aid from the united states 
its not a question of cancellation of debt but i think 
that our representatives will ask the united states for finding 
some ways to solve to help us solve our economic problems 
shamir told reporters today 
bush administration officials say the president is considering 
forgiving the egyptian debt as a reward to egypt for joining the 
usled multinational force in the persian gulf and taking part in 
the trade embargo against iraq 
israel has maintained a low profile in the crisis reportedly at 
the request of the americans who fear an israeli role could break 
up the alliance of moderate arab states against iraq 
foreign ministry officials refused to discuss modais plans 
saying any comments could interfere with foreign minister david 
levys trip to washington he is to meet secretary of state james 
a baker iii on wednesday 
modai also said he would demand substantial increases in us 
aid to help absorb soviet immigrants to israel some estimates say 
israel needs 30 billion to 40 billion to absorb about 1 million 
immigrants over the next five years 
israel already has asked for 400 million in us loan 
guarantees to help settle the soviets but the request has not been 
fulfilled because of american fears the money would be used to 
increase jewish settlements in the occupied territories 
the new demands came after israel asked washington for 
additional advanced weapons complaining of increased danger from 
the iraqis and from new us weapons expected to be supplied to 
saudi arabia 
the list of weapons requested by israel reportedly includes more 
f16 warplanes and apache antitank helicopters than previously 
agreed as well as two patriot antiballistic missile systems 
preferably on lease

construction spending posted a slight 04 
percent gain in july the first advance in four months the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4422 billion 
construction spending had not risen since a 04 percent increase 
last march it had fallen 09 percent in both may and june and 19 
percent in april 
but todays report showed spending in june was weaker than first 
reported the department initially had said spending was unchanged 
analysts have attributed the general weakness to high interest 
rates tight lending requirements and in some areas overbuilding 
that resulted in major vacancies 
the weakness has been illustrated in recent labor department 
reports showing the loss of 100000 construction jobs since last 
fall the latest report said payrolls fell by 50000 in july after 
seasonal adjustment for their fifth consecutive decline 
construction spending in july was 31 percent above that of the 
same month in 1989 when it totaled 4290 billion

after a 16 percent drop a month earlier apartment construction 
fell 16 percent to 184 billion after a 36 percent drop in june 
nonresidential spending led by industrial construction rose 
25 percent to 1075 billion after a 18 percent gain the previous 
month industrial building was up a strong 93 percent to 224

columbia and the observatory inside 
its cargo bay were pronounced troublefree as the clock ticked on 
toward a thursday launch and nasas first shuttle flight in more 
than four months 
it is the third countdown for the astronomy mission which was 
delayed by fuel leaks in may and telescope problems last week 
liftoff is set for 120 am edt 
everybodys very comfortable test director al sofge said 
today were just proceeding down through the count business as 
usual doing what we do best no problems 
columbia was supposed to have lifted off may 30 with the 150 
million observatory but the launch was scrubbed because of a 
hydrogen leak atlantis was found a month later to have a similar 
problem and nasa temporarily grounded the threeshuttle fleet 
nasa replaced columbias leaky hydrogen lines and rescheduled 
liftoff for saturday but that attempt was abandoned because of 
communication problems with astros 1500pound xray telescope 
the problem was fixed over the weekend 
four of columbias seven astronauts are astronomers who will 
take turns operating astros three ultraviolet telescopes round the 
clock the xray telescope will be managed from the ground 
the nine to 10day flight will be the first shuttle mission in 
five years devoted entirely to scientific research 
nasa plans to move discovery to the other shuttle launch pad 
tonight for a flight in october with the ulysses spacecraft which 
will be sent on a fiveyear journey to explore the suns polar 
regions 
that mission will be followed in november by atlantis 
classified pentagon flight originally scheduled for july 
nasa had hoped for nine shuttle missions this year but so far 
has flown only three 
the last shuttle flight was in april when discovery carried the 
hubble space telescope into orbit the 15 billion observatory 
later was found to have a flawed mirror that produces blurry images 
astronomers have been waiting 4 years for the astro mission 
columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with astro in 
march 1986 to study among other things halleys comet the 
mission and all others were postponed after the challenger disaster 
on its revamped schedule astro will examine some of the hottest 
objects in the universe including a supernova and comet levy 
which is making its first recorded pass through the solar system

in a move that could undermine talks on 
a un plan to end the cambodian war the khmer rouge said today it 
would not attend a peace conference in indonesia unless the 
cambodian prime minister agrees to go 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan said he had planned to leave 
for jakarta on wednesday but changed his mind after hearing state 
radio report that cambodias premier hun sen would not attend the 
talks set to begin thursday 
he said that showed phnom penh and vietnam are not sincere in 
the search of a solution and did not accept the un peace plan 
khieu samphan said however he would go to jakarta if hun sen 
also went 
if hun sen doesnt go there is no point in having any 
meeting said another khmer rouge official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
fighting will continue he said 
fighting has the aim of forcing the vietnamese to talk he 
said 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas said he was 
disappointed by the threat to the talks and said he was trying to 
resolve the problems 
the whole world is placing its hope on the jakarta meeting 
he said now is the best time to try it the cambodian leaders 
should be able to see this 
the khmer rouge has by far the most powerful guerrilla army 
because of arms aid from china many countries say that despite the 
groups brutal record when it ruled cambodia in the 1970s khmer 
rouge participation in a negotiated settlement is crucial because 
the guerrillas otherwise would keep on fighting 
prince norodom ranariddh whose guerrillas are allied with the 
khmer rouge also said today he would not attend for the same 
reason khieu samphan gave 
both ranariddh and hun sen said they were sending subordinates 
to the jakarta meeting 
hun sen had announced he was not attending because prince 
norodom sihanouk ranariddhs father and leader of the 
threefaction guerrilla coalition said he was not attending 
son sann who leads the third guerrilla group the khmer 
peoples national liberation front is expected to participate 
the guerrillas are allied in a coalition fighting the government 
that vietnam installed in phnom penh after invading the country in 
late 1978 
hopes for a settlement were raised after the five permanent 
members of the un security council who back different sides in 
the conflict adopted a comprehensive peace plan for cambodia last 
week the members are the united states the soviet union china 
france and britain 
their plan called for the united nations to supervise five key 
government ministries in the period before a general election a 
supreme national council comprising representatives of phnom penh 
and the guerrillas would act as a figurehead government 
the khmer rouge is composed of fanatical communists who killed 
hundreds of thousands of people when they ruled cambodia from 1975 
until vietnams invasion hun sen and other phnom penh leaders held 
positions of authority during the khmer rouge reign until they 
defected under threat of purges

jordans crown prince today criticized the 
international community for doing little to help thousands of asian 
refugees from iraq and kuwait some of whom are dying from exposure 
in the desert 
international organizations trying to cope with the refugee 
flood said more funds were urgently needed to tackle the crisis 
an estimated 420000 refugees most of them arabs have poured 
into jordan across the desert since saddam hussein invaded kuwait 
aug 2 many arabs have been repatriated but more than 100000 
asians indians sri lankans bangladeshis thais and filipinos 
remain stranded in jordan 
some are stuck in a squalid makeshift camp in the no mans land 
just inside jordan because authorities at the border post of 
ruweishid swamped by the human tide has not been able to process 
them 
the jordanians have said they cannot let them in until their 
home governments guarantee aircraft or ships to evacuate them 
prince hassan brother of king hussein appealed for immediate 
aid 
we should not forget that the situation critical as it is 
may be only the tip of the iceberg he told a news conference 
organized by the un disaster and relief agency 
although much attention has been given to the westerners trapped 
in iraq and kuwait little has been focused on the asians and other 
refugees 
at the desert camp at shaalan 25 miles from rusweishid where 
41000 people await transport home refugees are dying from 
exposure in the parching sun and chilling temperatures at night 
the aid workers said monday 
one doctor said he feared outbreaks of deadly diseases such as 
cholera and typhus because of nonexistent sanitation 
conditions 
things are so bad we dont even know how many have died 
people are in awful shape said rebecca salti an american 
settled in jordan who works with save the children 
dick clay an american construction manager who spent three days 
at the camp after fleeing kuwait disguised as a filipino said he 
thought people would start killing one another over supplies if 
nothing is done to help them 
hassan said today that the united nations should be helping and 
he appealed to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
appoint a representative to tackle the crisis 
the plight of these people has only evoked the faintest of 
responses from the world community and from a world press more 
interested in war scenarios than in humantarian relief he 
declared 
the office of the un disaster relief coordinator undro which 
is overseeing the international relief effort said governments had 
contributed only 95 million toward its 60 million appeal 
the genevabased international organization for migration said 
it needed more than 23 million to help evacuate asians whose 
countries were too poor to meet transportation costs from the 
mideast 
india said today it has chartered aircraft and is exploring the 
possibilty of hiring ships to bring back stranded indians a 
foreign ministry spokesman said india also has sent food to amman 
for the refugees 
we are trying our best to bring back all those indians who 
want to come home spokesman aftab seth said 
a virgin atlantic boeing 747 departed london today for amman 
where it was expected to pick up 150 british citizens and 250 
egyptians the flight left with nearly 30 tons of supplies 
requested by jordan including 26000 blankets five tons of rice 
and flour donated by supermarkets and 2 tons of antibiotics 
solutions to combat dehydration and other medicines 
king hussein of jordan has given us a list of things he needs 
which is frightening it goes on for pages said richard branson 
an airline executive 
a un food agency announced today it would provide 3446 tons 
of emergency food aid for refugees in jordan the 19 million food 
shipment including wheat flour canned fish meat and cheese will 
be distributed to 120000 people over 90 days said the world food 
program 
aid workers at the desert camp have described scenes of violence 
in one case refugees bashed in an indian womans face with a 
water jug in another several thousand refugees beat an indian who 
volunteered to help relief workers when they suspected him of 
cheating in distributing tents 
turkey like jordan has received thousands of refugees over the 
past month since iraq invaded kuwait and refugees described 
similarly desperate conditions at a camp on the iraqi side of the 
turkeyiraq frontier 
they said at least three pakistanis including a woman giving 
birth have died pakistans military attache in ankara staff col 
arshad setih called the conditions deplorable 
the philippines has asked the governments of its asian neighbors 
to help evacuate thousands of filipinos in jordan foreign

us coast guardsmen boarded an 
iraqiflagged freighter in the gulf of oman today in an effort to 
enforce the international embargo on iraqi trade naval and 
shipping sources reported 
it was the first reported case of us forces boarding an 
iraqiflagged vessel since the un sanctions were clamped on iraq 
last month to punish baghdad for invading kuwait 
last week the un security council authorized dozens of 
warships in the region to use military force to uphold the 
sanctions 
the shipping sources said the 3549ton zanoobia was laden with 
tea picked up in colombo sri lanka and apparently bound for iraq 
the us warships intercepted the vessel in the gulf of oman 
before it could reach the strait of hormuz the gateway to the 
persian gulf the sources said on condition of anonymity 
us navy officials in manama refused to give details of the 
reported incident other reports that the vessel was seized and 
taken to the omani port of muscat could not immediately be 
confirmed 
the only other ship that us forces are reported to have 
boarded and subsequently prevented from docking was the 91478ton 
kota wirama managed by the pacific international lines of 
singapore 
that vessel was intercepted in the red sea aug 28 boarded and 
searched and then prevented from proceeding to the jordanian port 
of aqaba 
jordan has been one of the weak links in the blockade because of 
its proiraqi sympathies and its relatively open northeastern 
border with iraq 
the pentagon has reported that more than 350 ships of various 
nationalities have been challenged by us warships in the persian 
gulf and the red sea and at least 10 boarded since the un 
security council decreed the embargo 
about four dozen coast guard members trained on boarding 
vessels in the caribbean to search for drugs have been sent out to 
help the navy with cases that necessitate boarding to check ship 
registers and cargo

stalking young women seemed to be taunting authorities by the way 
he arranged evidence at the scene 
in the scene the setup there was a message to law 
enforcement to whoever police capt rb ward said monday he 
was very calculated very methodical in the way the person did 
things as well as left things 
authorities would not elaborate on how evidence was arranged 
classes for more than 40000 students resumed at the university 
of florida and santa fe community college today after the labor day 
weekend uf spokesman larry humes said at midmorning that a spot 
check with faculty members showed that a vast majority of the 
student body was back in class 
students remained afraid amid warnings that the killer who 
stabbed four women and a man in their offcampus apartments may 
still be in their midst 
many students came back armed university president john 
lombardi said 100 of the schools 34000 students transferred or 
dropped out 
im really petrified afraid said michelle an 18yearold 
freshman from plantation who refused to give her last name and said 
she fled town after the bodies were found but i bought some mace 
and a baseball bat im prepared 
the killer stalking trim brunettes slipped in through windows or 
doors in three attacks within miles of each other police said the 
victims attended either the university or the college and were 
discovered aug 2628 three were mutilated 
he is spending considerable time at the scene i dont think 
any of us can say how long were each of the opinion it wasnt in 
and out said ward a leader of a 175member task force 
investigating the slayings 
when we walked in we saw the play he had set up for us 
added jo jackson lead investigator for the florida department of 
law enforcement the messages werent written but seemed to be 
daring police to catch the killer he said 
police said they have four primary suspects including edward 
humphrey a mentally disturbed university freshman jailed on 
charges of beating his grandmother the 18yearold is being held 
on 1 million bail 
humphrey lived briefly this summer at an apartment complex where

mutilated police had no comment on the report 
humphreys fingerprints and footprints and samples of his blood 
have been taken police said his psychiatric records also were 
seized 
his apartment remained under guard over the weekend while 
officers continued searching a murky creek near the scene of the 
most recent slaying 
defense attorney jr russo said he would ask for a reduction in 
bail at a hearing scheduled for thursday morning 
are we just holding a citizen just because he fits a certain 
mental psychological profile or do they have specific evidence 
which justifies a million dollar bond he asked a lot of 
improper things have taken place 
some students said they felt relatively safe because of the 
security in the dorms and because the slayings were off campus 
i dont think we should stop our lives because of it said 
laura whitkowsky 18 a freshman from port st lucie my parents 
wanted me to come home but i told them the dorm was the safest 
place to be 
lincoln m llopiz of miami and his wife sold mace on a street 
corner near campus monday business for the 799 canisters was 
slow 
there is more panic in miami than gainesville said llopiz 
who brought 17000 containers but had sold fewer than 10 by early 
evening

at least 40 blacks were killed 
in savage township fighting including 11 who died when soldiers 
fired assault rifles today on a crowd at a migrant workers hostel 
police said 
the latest violence came as president fw de klerk and african 
national congress leader nelson mandela toured the townships to 
call for an end to the black factional fighting that has killed 
more than 550 people in the past three weeks 
the worst fighting occurred in sebokeng south of johannesburg 
where police said they entered a migrant workers hostel to 
investigate the deaths of four men believed to be township 
residents abducted by the hostel dwellers 
an armed mob of up to 5000 gathered outside the hostel saying 
they wanted to launch a revenge attack on zulus inside police said 
when the mob refused to disperse army troops were called in and 
a shooting incident occurred said police col frans malherbe 
he said 11 bodies were found after the mob dispersed 
malherbe said both the police and military were investigating 
the shooting 
township resident n khumalo said the soldiers took up a 
position cocked their guns i thought maybe they wanted to scare 
the people 
all of a sudden there was shooting many of the people ran 
some of the people fell khumalo was quoted as saying by the 
independent south african press association 
police said 36 people were killed in various clashes today in 
sebokeng they reported four deaths overnight in vosloorus and 
katlehong southeast of johannesburg witnesses said several more 
people were killed in the two townships but the deaths could not 
be confirmed 
they also said they arrested 150 men in connection with the 
earlier violence in the hostel and confiscated four ak47 assault 
rifles 
mandela visited sebokeng today and said he was outraged 
after viewing corpses at the local mortuary 
a sapa reporter following mandela into the township lew elias 
said his vehicle was stoned overturned and set alight by angry 
township youths elias suffered only minor injuries 
in vosloorus southeast of johannesburg witnesses said zulus 
loyal to the conservative inkatha movement stoned houses and set 
them alight monday night a similar attack was reported in 
neighboring katlehong police and witnesses reported 10 deaths in 
the two townships 
in renewed clashes in vosloorus today zulus from a workers 
hostel used axes spears shovels and other weapons to attack 
houses township residents some with gas bombs tried a 
counterattack on the hostel but police repeatedly fired tear gas 
and shotguns to keep the two sides apart some women packed their 
children and belongings in trucks and fled the area 
much of the recent fighting has pitted inkathasupporting zulus 
living in the hostels against blacks in the townships who back the 
african national congress the countrys largest opposition 
movement 
de klerk meanwhile was mobbed by youths and greeted with cries 
of viva de klerk as he toured the huge soweto township 
outside johannesburg 
at one stop he visited a migrant workers hostel whose residents 
have been involved in the recent battles hes a brave man to 
come here he must be a good leader said one man living in the 
rundown hostel 
afterward de klerk told a news conference im glad we could 
visit the hostel and that we could see circumstances which are 
absolutely unacceptable 
de klerk says the government wants to provide family housing for 
all blacks but the current housing shortage makes it impractical 
to tear down existing hostels for single working men 
the anc and its allies blame the police for fueling the township 
violence and claim the force has been siding with inkatha 
law and order minister adriaan vlok again denied the charges 
saying government opponents were waging an orchestrated campaign to 
discredit the police individual policemen may have acted 
improperly but the force as a whole has been impartial and 
prevented the violence from escalating vlok said in an interview 
with governmentrun television 
de klerk has ordered vlok to investigate the allegations of 
improper police conduct 
but mandela said monday there should be an independent inquiry 
a leader of the proapartheid conservative party said monday 
that police should let black factions fight each other instead of 
facing criticism for trying to intervene 
the question is why do mandela and other black leaders not 
stop their own supporters or is it an admission that they have 
lost control said moolman mentz the partys spokesman for law 
and order 
mandela has repeatedly refused to meet inkatha leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi an old friend 
the anc says buthelezi is using the violence obtain a meeting 
with mandela and enhance his stature buthelezi meanwhile says 
the anc wants to crush all opposition and is to blame for the 
fighting 
the ancinkatha feud has claimed some 5000 lives since 1986 in 
the eastern province of natal where most of the blacks are zulus

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
today proposed an international conference on the persian gulf 
crisis that would also take up the arabisraeli conflict and the 
civil war in lebanon 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir suggested israel might 
attend an international conference if invited but only if 
discussions were limited to the gulf crisis 
in a major foreign policy address delivered in the pacific coast 
city of vladivostok shevardnadze also said sundays superpower 
summit in helsinki finland would mark a major milestone on the 
road toward resolving the crisis in the persian gulf 
he repeated moscows condemnation of iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait and appealed anew for a resolution by diplomatic means 
rather than military force the text of his speech was distributed 
by the official tass news agency 
for the first time in history the international community has 
acted with unanimity and firmness in response to aggression and 
in seeking to eliminate its consequences shevardnadze told an 
international meeting on asian relations 
but it is essential to pursue our objective through 
nonmilitary means and in a way that would remove the military 
presence of other countries he said 
in proposing the international conference on the middle east 
shevardnadze linked the persian gulf crisis to the conflict between 
the palestinians and the israelis as well as the civil strife in 
lebanon 
presumably israels agreement to its a conferences 
convocation could exert a positive influence on the overall 
situation in the middle east and on efforts to defuse the crisis in 
the persian gulf the soviet foreign minister said 
iraqi president saddam hussein has proposed that a pullout of 
his troops from kuwait be contingent upon an israeli withdrawal 
from the occupied territories the united states and israel 
rejected the plan 
if israel were to participate in the conference shevardnadze 
said the soviet union might take a fresh look at the issue 
of sovietisraeli relations 
the soviet union and israel have not had diplomatic relations 
since the 1967 middle east war although both countries have been 
moving closer in recent months 
in jerusalem shamir said israel would consider participating in 
the sovietproposed international conference although israel has 
been careful to avoid any direct involvement in the gulf crisis 
i still havent received this proposal after we hear it and 
we examine its details we will decide shamir told reporters 
however he reiterated the israeli refusal to discuss the 
palestinian question at such a forum 
israel has vehemently opposed previous sovietbacked ideas to 
hold an international conference to resolve the arabisraeli 
conflict including the palestinian issue 
we have our position about an international conference around 
the solution of the israeliarab conflict we will not participate 
in such an international conference shamir said 
shevardnadze also said such a conference should not delay 
efforts by the united nations to achieve a peaceful settlement in 
the persian gulf 
he blamed the great powers a reference to the soviet union 
and the united states for supplying arms in the region 
unless peace comes to the middle east we shall continue to 
pay a huge price for its wars he said it is time that we 
acted now in the interests of the worlds integrity 
shevardnadze who traveled later to tokyo also proposed that 
all foreign ministers from asian countries meet in vladivostok in 
the autumn of 1993 to discuss issues relating to the region tass 
said he said the details could be discussed at an upcoming session 
of the un general assembly

brown former chairman of the house labor commerce and industry 
committee was the first of the five indicted legislators to appear 
before a federal judge the five were indicted as part of a 
16monthold federal investigation 
the bribetaking charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in 
prison and a fine of 250000 neither brown nor prosecutors would 
comment immediately on whether they had made a plea bargain that 
would affect browns sentence 
court officials said brown will remain free on bond during a 
presentencing investigation that would take three to six weeks 
brown was charged with taking a 2000 bribe from lobbyist ron 
cobb who was working for the fbi in a videotaped operation 
the indictment accused the 34yearold democrat of voting for 
and promising to work behind the scenes for passage of a bill 
that would have allowed voters to decide whether to permit 
parimutuel betting in south carolina 
browns committee passed the bill in march 1989 the full house 
never considered the legislation later that year or in 1990 
in late july shortly after news of the investigation broke 
brown who had served in the house since 1983 filed an amended

five remaining morning newspapers four english and one afrikaans 
and several weekly newspapers 
reports that the daily mail needed more money began circulating 
last week according to news reports the newspaper had a 
circulation of about 14000 and needed 25000 to break even 
we have not raised the money needed to continue publishing the 
daily and will now revert to publishing only the weekly mail

this newspaper was a brief experiment to try and change the 
situation its suspension does not bode well for attempts to create

construction spending edged up 04 percent in 
july for its first gain in four months the government said 
tuesday but analysts expect the industry to remain weak through 
the end of the year 
the commerce department said spending on residential 
nonresidential and government buildings totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4422 billion 
analysts had said the weakness in the construction industry was 
due to consumer caution high interest rates tight lending 
requirements and in some areas overbuilding 
iraq made things worse said david seiders chief economist 
for the national association of home builders 
construction spending had not risen since a 04 percent increase 
in march it fell 09 percent in both may and june and 19 percent 
in april 
but the latest report showed spending in may and june was even 
weaker than first reported the department initially had said 
spending in may was down just 03 percent and in june was unchanged 
labor department employment reports further illustrate the 
weakness the department has said construction employment has 
declined for five straight months including the loss of 50000 
jobs in july after seasonal adjustment payrolls have fallen by 
100000 since last fall 
residential spending in july fell 04 percent to 1905 
billion its fourth consecutive drop including a 34 percent loss 
in june 
singlefamily spending was down 13 percent to 1102 billion 
for its fourth straight decline including a 16 percent drop in 
june apartment construction fell 16 percent to 184 billion 
after a 36 percent drop in june it has fallen for three months 
the new structure component will continue to move down 
certainly through the end of the year seiders said adding that 
the report implies strong performance only in additions and 
alterations to existing structures 
this is what we usually see in down cycles he said 
people just add on to houses 
nonresidential spending rose 25 percent to 1075 billion 
after a 18 percent gain the previous month 
the only truly bright spot is the industrial component 
which was up 93 percent in july seiders said but the permit 
information has been weakening and we expect this part of the 
market will lose its momentum 
the other two major nonresidential components office 
buildings and other commercial construction such as shopping 
centers remains weak seiders said 
government spending edged down 02 percent to 1086 billion 
after rising 07 percent the previous month 
overall construction spending in july was 31 percent above that 
of july 1989 when it totaled 4290 billion

president bush has decided to ask congress to 
forgive egypts entire 7 billion military debt because of its 
leadership in standing up to iraqi aggression the white house 
announced today 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said forgiving the debt 
recognizes the strategic importance of egypt in the 
multinational effort to enforce the united nations trade embargo 
against baghdad 
it is a symbol of our appreciation for the role played by 
egyptian president hosni mubarak fitzwater said 
bush consulted with congressional leaders before making the 
decision fitzwater said waiving egypts military debt largely 
amassed through us arms sales to cairo requires an act of 
congress 
another 6 billion in nonmilitary egyptian debt to the united 
states would not be affected fitzwater said 
the announcement came after bush met with his cabinet for a 
postvacation briefing on the persian gulf crisis 
he hinted that other packages for other countries in the region 
helping enforce the embargo including israel might be forthcoming 
as well 
we think we will be able to put together a rather sizeable 
package of support for middle eastern countries that are in need as 
a result of this effort against iraq fitzwater said 
meanwhile fitzwater indicated that the president might expand 
his trip next weekend to meet soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to include a visit to another country on the way home from 
helsinki finland 
bush will leave washington on friday night for the oneday 
summit with gorbachev on sunday fitzwater said that the summit 
would follow the flexible pattern set by the two leaders in their 
initial meeting last december at malta 
fitzwater had no details on where bush might stop on the way 
home from finland after the malta summit the president addressed 
nato allies in brussels 
the white house official said the principal goal of the hastily 
arranged helsinki summit was sowing unity and support by the two 
superpowers for the common objective of stopping saddam hussein 
although soviet support for the usled military effort to 
enforce the trade embargo against iraq has been lukewarm fitzwater 
said i find no area of disagreement with the soviets on the 
current persian gulf crisis 
fitzwater meanwhile denied there was a dispute with the 
government of saudi arabia on which nation controls the decision to 
launch a us military offensive 
its a consultation process fitzwater said 
we have an excellent working relationship with the saudi 
arabian government he added 
fitzwater meanwhile confirmed news reports that us coast 
guardsman had boarded an iraqiflagged freighter loaded with tea 
in the gulf of oman in an effort to enforce the international 
embargo 
the ship was ordered to divert it did not divert it was then 
boarded and now has diverted we dont have information now on 
where its being diverted to he said 
the spokesman acknowledged that some goods have been trucked 
into iraq across the jordanian border but he characterized this 
as a minor broaching of the embargo and said it was not a problem 
for the overall effectiveness of the sanctions 
fitzwater summing up the status of americans who remain trapped 
in iraq and kuwait said there are 2000 american citizens left in 
kuwait of which 1200 are women and children 
in iraq there are still 250 americans about half of whom are 
women and children fitzwater said 
about 100 americans were brought home over the weekend 
earlier today bush met with his cabinet for a postvacation 
briefing on the gulf crisis 
the president returning to the capital just five days before he 
holds his third summit with gorbachev also was dispatching two top 
aides to solicit donations from wealthy allies to cover expenses of 
the us military operation in the gulf region 
we are going to have to expect more cooperation from the 22 
countries that are participating in this effort rep dan 
rostenkowski dill the chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said today 
rostenkowski who returned from saudi arabia monday night also 
said on cbs this morning that americans are just going to 
have to recognize the fact that sacrifice is going to be necessary 
i think were going to have to raise revenues cut spending be 
a little more prudent about the way we spend our defense dollars 
sen carl levin dmich appearing with rostenkowski echoed 
the call for more international support weve got to focus on a 
number of things and one is the burdensharing issue we must get 
more of our allies there in greater numbers 
levin said the morale of us troops is very very high but 
he said they are in an extraordinarily difficult environment 
and are getting no mail yet no newspapers no cigarettes were 
going to have to worry about rotation and relief for some of our 
forces 
a delegation of 22 house members returned to washington on 
monday night after touring the persian gulf region and inspecting 
the us military operation that has been rushed in since iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
rep richard gephardt dmo the house majority leader told 
reporters at andrews air force base md all of us left here with 
the conclusion that the presidents action was a correct action 
all of us come back believing that is the case 
but gephardt added we need more help especially from our 
nato allies to have troops on the ground with ours he said the 
bipartisan delegation also firmly believes that the financial 
burden of supporting multilateral military deployments in the 
persian gulf area must be shared equitably 
baker leaves thursday for saudi arabia and the gulf region to 
solicit financial contributions to bolster the us effort and also 
to provide economic assistance to countries hard hit by the embargo 
against iraq he also planned stops in west germany and italy 
treasury secretary nicholas brady was setting out on a similar 
mission today to paris london seoul and tokyo 
bush announced last week that he wants to enlist the wealthy 
nations of the world to help pay the 1 billion per month in us 
costs for military might mustered against iraqi president saddam 
hussein

when an army truck broke 
down recently in the middle of this west bank town palestinian 
teenagers sprang into action 
they trashed it said an israeli army officer who witnessed 
the scene they broke every window smashed every door and 
fender 
the incident was a reminder that the palestinian revolt against 
israeli occupation though eclipsed by the gulf crisis persists as 
an angry war of stones and empty bottles against wellarmed israeli 
troops 
the uprising known in arabic as the intefadeh marks its 
1000th day wednesday the plobacked underground leadership of the 
revolt called for the anniversary to be marked with protest marches 
under the banner intefadeh until a palestinian state 
that goal remains illusive for the 17 million palestinians in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip and the character of the 
struggle is changing amid a more restrained israeli military policy 
and the impact of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
palestinian support for iraqi leader saddam hussein has 
disappointed the united states and other western nations that tried 
to mediate the israelipalestinian conflict 
theres no doubt that israel is reaping political gains from 
the gulf crisis said ghassan khatib a palestinian professor 
from this town just north of jerusalem 
there are fewer pressures on israel from the united states to 
start a dialogue with the palestinians khatib said there is 
no more talk about israeli violations of human rights in the 
occupied territories 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday dismissed 
reporters questions about the anniversary 
it doesnt have any impact on the progress of the jewish 
people and the jewish state shamir said 
since the revolt began in december 1987 a total of 728 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in 
addition 255 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaboration with israel fortyseven israelis 
have died 
in recent months according to both palestinians and israeli 
army officials there has been a marked slowdown in the uprising 
under defense minister moshe arens the army since june has 
reduced its forces in heavily populated areas and tightened firing 
rules sharply reducing palestinian casualties 
in the past three months 11 palestinians have died from israeli 
army gunfire in the same period last year the toll was 77 
it reflects more experience by the army in handling the 
situation said an army spokesman who cannot be identified by 
name under military rules troops are positioned so there is less 
friction with the local population 
meanwhile the palestinian side shows signs of fatigue from the 
almost weekly general strikes ordered by uprising leaders and 
forced closures by the army 
our business barely feeds our family said zaki musleh a 
60yearold carpenter with a shop on ramallahs palestine street 
no one has any money 
muslehs shop like many others is short one worker his 
28yearold son bassam is in army custody one of more than 910 
palestinians held without charge or trial under military 
administrative detention rules 
some 9015 other palestinians also are in jail charged or 
awaiting trial or sentenced for antiisraeli crimes the army says 
palestinians remain resilient despite the revolts failure to 
achieve its main political goal of getting the israelis out of the 
territories they seized in the 1967 middle east war 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab said he believes the main 
achievement of the intefadeh has been a change in palestinian 
attitudes 
palestinians are no longer thinking as an occupied people 
they are thinking as a people resisting occupation he said 
that is why the uprising will continue 
in ramallahs kadura refugee camp 29yearold truck driver ziad 
zmekna points to greater international awareness of the 
palestinians plight as another gain from the uprising 
zmeknas life is a measure of palestinian determination one of 
his brothers is jailed another is hiding from authorities and 
zmekna himself has lost his drivers license for failure to pay 
income taxes to the israelis 
he points to a photo on his wall the wedding portrait of a 
palestinian friend killed by israeli troops last year 
the intefadeh will continue for our martyrs it will continue 
for us zmekna said this is our national duty

the national institutes of health announced 
today that scientists have isolated the gene responsible for 
osteoarthritis a painful crippling disease that affects about 16 
million americans 
dr darwin j prockop of philadelphias thomas jefferson 
university and dr roland w moskowitz of case western reserve 
university in cleveland led the scientists who isolated a flawed 
gene that normally helps make collagen a protein that strengthens 
joints 
the scientists studied genetic material from 19 members of a 
threegeneration family and found that the faulty gene was 
affecting the family members as young as 16 
osteoarthritis leads to a wearing away of joints and serious 
cases of severe crippling it can affect the hands feet hips and 
knees 
identifying the gene officials said may lead to new treatments 
and even prevention 
understanding genetic mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis may 
give us the potential to intervene early in a painful disabling

the soviets on tuesday proposed an international 
conference to discuss the persian gulf crisis the arabisraeli 
dispute and the lebanese civil war 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir reiterated his opposition 
to discussing the palestinian issue at an international conference 
but he welcomed the idea of a conference on the persian gulf 
a spokesman for president mikhail s gorbachev declined to say 
how hard he will press the issue at the summit with president bush 
on sunday 
the soviet president intends to discuss ways of defusing 
the persian gulf crisis and he believes that all efforts 
including those of a mediator are viewed positively in the soviet 
union presidential spokesman vitaly n ignatenko told a news 
conference 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze proposed the conference 
earlier in the day during a speech in vladivostok in the soviet 
far east shevardnadze said the summit in helsinki finland will 
mark a major milestone on the road toward resolving the crisis in 
the persian gulf 
but he said that after one more look at the situation we 
still have come to the same conclusion that an international 
conference on the middle east is necessary he stressed that in the 
meantime efforts to bring about a settlement of the persian gulf 
situation under un auspices should continue 
the soviet union voted for a un security council embargo 
against iraq after its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and has given 
lukewarm support to us navy actions to enforce the sanctions 
this is a departure from the kremlins historic stance in the 
past it shipped arms to militant arab states including iraq was 
hostile to israel and supported the palestine liberation 
organization 
shevardnadze criticized the previous arms sales to iraq which 
ended after the invasion and said the soviet union might 
reexamine its relations with israel but he also linked solution 
of the persian gulf crisis to the palestinian issue as well as to 
the civil war in lebanon 
iraqi president saddam hussein at one point proposed that a 
pullout of his troops from kuwait be contingent upon an israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied territories the united states 
rejected the plan 
at this point in time there is a growing awareness that a 
complex of problems involving the arabisraeli conflict the fate 
of the palestinians and the tragedy in lebanon awaits its 
resolution in the middle east shevardnadze said in his speech 
which was carried by the state news agency tass 
presumably israels agreement to its a conferences 
convocation could exert a positive influence on the overall 
situation in the middle east and on efforts to defuse the crisis in 
the persian gulf he said 
for its part the soviet union might take a fresh look at 
the issue of sovietisraeli relations shevardnadze added 
the soviet union and israel have not had diplomatic relations 
since the 1967 middle east war although both countries have been 
moving closer in recent months 
in jerusalem shamir said in response to the proposal on the 
subject of the persian gulf yes 
he continued we have our position about an international 
conference around the solution of the israeliarab conflict we 
will not participate in such an international conference 
israel has vehemently opposed soviet ideas to hold an 
international conference to resolve the arabisraeli conflict 
ignatenko while declining to disclose what proposals gorbachev 
might make at the summit read a statement saying that the 
president of the ussr attaches great importance to the 
forthcoming helsinki meeeting 
mikhail gorbachev will use this meeting as a continuation of 
contacts to maintain the spirit of the malta meeting and the 
washington meeting he said referring to summits last december 
and june 
it is going to be a working meeting to discuss a great host of 
international topics and bilateral relations he said 
gorbachev and shevardnadze are to travel to helsinki on saturday 
evening and return on sunday night said ignatenko denying rumors 
the summit might last an additional day the two leaders will 
address a joint news conference at the conclusion of their talks 
he said 
the agenda of the meeting will include discussions of the 
crisis in the persian gulf the president of the ussr and the 
soviet leadership have their own information about state of affairs 
in the persian gulf area and this issue is under discussion with 
leaders of the persian gulf and arab states as well as western 
european countries with whom we maintain close relationships

offered them a chance to turn things around but a statewide 
television blitz emphasizing martinez as a lawandorder governor 
and family man helped him move to nearly even with chiles in polls 
released last week 
republicans hope to hold the governors mansion and grab command 
of the state senate in november putting them in position to 
control redistricting in 1992 that will include at least three new 
congressional seats in this fastgrowing state 
chiles 60 said he entered the race last april because he felt 
the campaign was being dominated by big money he voluntarily 
limited donations to 100 each rejected political action committee 
contributions and said he took his inspiration from eastern 
europes revolutions 
chiles said rejecting big money will allow him to govern 
unencumbered by special interests and he hoped the movement could 
spread nationally 
but chiles a moderate with one of the highest reputations in 
politics for ethics was dogged by questions about his mental 
health he retired from the senate when his third term ended in 
january 1989 saying he was burned out at the time he was chairman 
of the senate budget committee 
he later was diagnosed as depressed and began using the drug 
prozac he stopped using it early in his campaign but resumed 
taking the antidepressant last month 
his running mate is kenneth buddy mackay former threeterm 
congressman who narrowly lost to mack in 1988 
nelson 47 claimed to have more energy and vision to lead the 
state the melbourne congressman known for a 1986 space shuttle 
mission began planning his gubernatorial bid nearly three years 
ago 
he was the democratic frontrunner until chiles surprise entry 
in april initial polls gave chiles a 50point or more lead over 
nelson but the congressman came back with an aggressive effort 
that claimed chiles was too vague lacked energy and wasnt as 
pure on ethics as believed 
nelsons campaign suffered a late setback when his running mate 
state house speaker tom gustafson was widely criticized and 
finally apologized after suggesting chiles might be suicidal 
martinez 55 only floridas second republican governor since 
reconstruction was hurt his first year by backing a sales services 
tax he later helped repeal he also stirred controversy last year 
by calling a special legislative session for what turned out to be 
an unsuccessful effort to further restrict abortion 
chiles and nelson favored abortion rights as did martinez 
opponent woodson howard 
the broward referendum was opposed by the roman catholic 
archdiocese of miami and by critics who warned its passage would 
bring more gays and aids to the country 
in sarasota supporters said a twoyear moratorium on new 
structures would give time to improve services and address other 
problems of growth opponents said a halt would put thousands out 
of work and damage the economy

two inmates at the prison where manuel noriega is 
being held dodged bullets to scale a fence and escape through the 
woods behind the institution but they were captured early today a

posted outside his specially built cell at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center wasnt involved

searched with dogs and with helicopters one of them equipped with 
infrared lights for night vision 
prison officials said the two were traveling together but were 
captured separately on foot about 3 miles from the prison about

class clowns around the country are returning to 
school armed with a new tool for teacher torture spit wads a 
hightech version of the oldfashioned spitball 
you cant stand in the way of progress inventor ted skup 
said tongue in cheek 
it sounds simple but try developing one said skup who 
created the wads after a years worth of sticky slippery research 
so what does this invention mean to the average underachieving 
student with 129 to spend 
no more telltale straws or messy clumps of unused wellchewed 
paper for one thing because you dont spit spit wads you 
toss them you get a quarterounce of a light blue nontoxic 
compound enough for several traditionalsize spitballs the 
material is described as a polymeric improvement on the original 
spitball that wont stain when stuck 
i threw a lot of stuff at the walls which never came off when 
i was developing this said skup 38 of schererville ind 
theres still a lot of marks on my wall 
skup came up with the idea during a lunch break from his job as 
a refinery worker after a years worth of experiments with every 
glue paste and adhesive he could find skup produced the spaceage 
spitballs and trademarked the spit wads name for the gumlike 
clumps 
i was lucky to get that he said proudly thats my own 
personal trademark for the next 20 years 
skup brought his creation to an old soccerplaying buddy 
soontobe financial backer scott hicko both vividly recall that 
day of destiny this past march 
once i threw it against the wall and it stuck i sold him you 
dont need a big presentation when the guy starts laughing for an 
hour said skup 
ive seen products all my life been in business for 20 years 
and seen a lot of gimmicks something hit me with this nostalgia 
maybe the old troublemaker in me said hicko 
hicko is not the only one with a misspent youth skup quickly 
announces he was voted class clown in high school both were 
surprised the product has been as popular among adults as with 
children 
it touches something in everybody everybody knows what a spit 
wad is said hicko i mean we thought our market was 7 to 12 
year olds we go into corporate offices and they go nuts 
everybody is flicking em at pictures of the boss 
groups dedicated to policing the school system said it was too 
soon to assess the impact of the spitball of the 90s 
this is the first weve heard of this wed have to get a 
little more information said stacey moore spokeswoman for the 
national parents amp teachers association i sure cant recall any 
product like that 
but skup is hopeful his product will soon become as popular as 
the pet rock or the mood ring 
there hasnt been a good fad in a really long time i mean 
bart simpson and the teenage mutant ninja turtles asked skup 
were hoping to jump in with something really off the wall

president franklin d roosevelts yacht 
often called the floating white house is on its way to 
becoming a floating museum 
the 165foot potomac has had numerous owners including elvis 
presley it once chased prohibition rum runners and finally was 
docked for alleged drug trafficking 
now its being restored by the potomac association for the 
latest owner the port of oakland with careful attention to detail 
it has to be as close as possible to what the president had 
said syrell sapoznick a spokeswoman for the association 
project manager dan holdgate has the paneling to the pilot house 
in his garage where he works on it during evenings and weekends 
he spent 200 hours refurbishing a dish rack of honduran mahogany 
and when a search for special hand cranks came up dry holdgate 
made them himself and had them chromed 
theres nobody else to do it holdgate said 
paul harless a navy veteran who served as a petty officer on 
the potomac from 1940 to 1942 is the source of much detail he 
even recalled the size of the sandbox for fdrs dog fala 18 inches 
high 3 feet square and filled twothirds with sand 
the dog had the run of the ship but it wasnt a favorite of 
the crew harless said 
the boat originally served as a coast guard cutter and pursued 
liquor smugglers 
congressmen and heads of state met with roosevelt on the ship 
after he took it as his personal yacht in 1936 he broadcast one of 
his fireside chats from the ship 
it also served as a personal retreat for roosevelt an avid 
fisherman and former assistant secretary of the navy who called 
boats his avocation 
the state of maryland bought it for use by its governor at the 
end of world war ii and it later went into private ownership 
in 1980 it was linked to drug trafficking and seized by the 
customs service while impounded at treasure island the boat hit 
pilings and sank in about 30 feet of water 
the port of oakland bought it for 15000 in 1981

scores of western nationals including 135 
west germans arrived in the jordanian capital today aboard two 
iraqi airways jetliners 
the first flight which landed at queen alia international 
airport brought 170 foreigners mostly arabs and asians there was 
one englishwoman among them georgina rose with her two children 
jemeela 18 months and sheherazade 6 months rose is married to 
an iraqi citizen 
the second plane which landed two hours later had 135 west 
germans plus some new zealanders irishmen and some other western 
citizens according to airport officials 
a british embassy official said 45 britons were expected on a 
third flight a us embassy spokesman said there would also be a 
number of americans on the plane but added that he was not sure 
how many 
the arriving westerners were taken immediately to the airport 
transit lounge and reporters were not allowed to speak to them 
airport officials told him that they would leave for frankfurt 
west germany later in the day on a lufthansa jetliner 
earlier today a britishorganized convoy of about 300 women and 
children left kuwait to drive across the desert to baghdad and 
authorities said a planeload of westerners might be allowed to 
leave for jordan on a uschartered iraqi airways flight 
meanwhile iraqi authorities said the united states was to blame 
if captive foreigners went hungry as a result of food shortages 
caused by the international economic sanctions against iraq 
iraq has said that western women and children trapped by the 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait will be permitted to leave but western 
men are being used as human shields to protect iraqi installations 
against potential attack 
more than 700 western hostages women children and a few 
ailing men have left but the departures of others have been 
complicated by iraqs refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in 
baghdad and by long delays in processing their exit permits by 
iraqi authorities 
about 11000 westerners are now believed stranded in kuwait and 
iraq 
some evacuees have traveled across the desert to jordan in the 
scorching summer heat the britishorganized convoy left kuwait at 
dawn today british foreign secretary douglas hurd told reporters 
in taif saudi arabia where he was meeting with the deposed 
kuwaiti government 
they were headed for baghdad in seven buses and a car he said 
and hoped to travel out of iraq from there 
the foreign secretary said 148 women and 150 children were on 
the 500mile trip in britain william waldegrave the 
secondranking official in the foreign office put the figure at 
148 women and 155 children 
a foreign office spokesman said later that the convoy had been 
organized for british citizens but it was not known whether some 
people of other nationalities were traveling with the group 
the foreign office had estimated earlier that the bus convoy 
would take 10 to 12 hours to reach baghdad waldegrave however 
noted that a previous convoy from kuwait needed 28 hours to 
complete its journey 
our hopes are that we can then get exit visas for them and 
probably on what the iraqis are saying at the moment we would 
have to hire an iraqi airplane perhaps to fly them to amman or 
perhaps straight home if we can waldegrave said in an interview 
with bbc radio 
a virgin atlantic boeing 747 arrived today in amman carrying 
relief supplies for jordan which has been overwhelmed by a human 
tide of asian and arab refugees from iraq and kuwait in jordan 
the flight was to pick up 150 british citizens and 250 egyptians 
who had left iraq and kuwait the airline said it was not clear 
when those people had gotten out of iraq 
west germany said 98 of its stranded women and children have 
arrived in baghdad after an overland trip from kuwait on monday 
twentyfour italians also made it by road to baghdad where sharp 
shortages in food supplies were reported in recent days 
iraqi authorities say foreigners are sharing the deprivations 
imposed on iraqis because of the uns economic sanctions against 
iraq an iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said thousands of 
expatriates were going hungry because of the food shortages 
the official iraqi news agency quoted the spokesman as saying a 
number of foreign governments had asked to send food to their 
nationals trapped in iraq but that they were prevented from doing 
so by the united states which is insisting on tightening its 
inhuman blockade 
therefore we deem it necessary to explain that iraq is in no 
way responsible for the starvation of these people as the united 
states shoulders full responsibility for their agony the 
unidentified spokesman said the dispatch was monitored in nicosia 
cyprus

followup flights after hundreds of western and japanese women and 
children were allowed to leave on iraqi jetliners on saturday 
but a convoy carrying about 300 british women and children left 
kuwait city just after dawn heading for baghdad where they hoped 
to continue overland to jordan or fly home via amman british

iraqi sites on orders of saddam who last week said women and

trapped in iraq and kuwait by the invasion

take urgent measures to send those citizens food supplies 
iraq rescinded landing rights for foreign charters into iraq to 
pick up foreign nationals and some sources said baghdad was

the embargo in exchange for freeing japanese hostages 
in paris the foreign ministry indicated iraq had set conditions 
unacceptable to france in return for landing rights that would 
allow a french plane to repatriate 200 women and children 
in baghdad earlier today western diplomats were negotiated 
frantically with officials at iraqs interior and foreign 
ministries to obtain exit permits for a group of 138 foreign women 
and children who want to leave on the iraqi airways flight

thousand more troops from the iraqioccupied emirate along with 
air force and navy units will join operation desert shield in the 
next few weeks

husseins tanks invaded aug 2 because the government had been 
lulled by iraqi assurances no invasion was imminent

could probably have held out for about four days he said as it 
was the kuwaitis were overwhelmed within hours

they sat down to computer terminals at 
6 pm friday and 48 hours and thousands of sentences later they 
got up proud authors of embryo novels 
the seven participants in the first annual labor day weekend 
writing marathon could boast that they spent the end of their 
summer vacation by writing a book or at least a rough draft 
it was way past my wildest expectations westfield state 
college english professor stephen sossaman said tuesday we had 
seven students who took the project very seriously for the entire 
48 hours they really didnt do anything but write except for 
occasional naps 
the novel activity designed to give students a chance to 
unleash their creativity was inspired by a contest sossaman read 
about in which professional writers competed against each other to 
turn out a book in a weekend 
three women and four men showed up at bates hall with sleeping 
bags toothbrushes change for pizza computer discs and 
imaginations they didnt bring notes or outlines 
sossaman suggested that they each pick a genre to help them get 
going such as horror or science fiction 
i thought a genre novel is a lot easier to write than the 
great american novel he said 
for hours at a stretch the clacking of keyboards was the only 
sound in the room 
its hard to describe how energizing this experience is even 
though the sleeping was a bit tough sossaman said in a telephone 
interview 
sophomore ja marshall who got started with the sentence he 
put on the dark black gloves and stared at himself in the mirror 
said he switched from sciencefiction to a psychodrama while 
tapping out his novel outline 
it was a wonderful experience we were able to have such a 
great block of time to throw into a project he said 
the thing was youd start to run out youd come to a point 
where the fear would start in the writers block would start in 
and youd look around you and youd see everybody else was still 
going he said 
when it was all over at 6 pm sunday each one more or less 
had a novel outline sossaman had just about finished a pulp novel 
on vietnam combat 
everyone wrote quite a bit no one expressed disappointment 
obviously you cant write a novel in a weekend but they made some 
progress he said 
sophomore angela collette who almost finished an untitled novel 
tracing the history of two girls growing up said she didnt regret 
giving up any beach time 
youve had all summer to lie by the pool she said i 
meant to write this summer instead of just wasting away 
students and sossaman said they hope to be back next year 
some people think i was crazy to do this but i like the 
idea of creative intensity sossaman said

in addition figures showing steep labor cost increases 
heightened analysts concerns that the nations inflation problems 
are worsening especially in light of the middle east oil crisis 
that threatens to push inflation higher 
it exacerbates the situation no question about it said 
elliott platt of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
even before the iraqi situation the us economy was facing 
an entrenched underlying labor cost inflation of between 4 and 5 
percent that doesnt allow for any profits added allen sinai 
chief economist at the boston co 
the 15 percent rise in nonfarm productivity defined as 
output per hour of work was the first increase since productivity 
climbed 05 percent in the final three months of 1988 the labor 
department said 
the rebound was a departure from productivitys poor performance 
in recent months productivity declined 03 percent last year the 
worst showing since output fell 09 percent during the 198182 
recession it had plunged 19 percent during the first quarter of 
this year the government said 
during the apriljune period this year there was no increase in 
the number of hours worked sinai called that a sign that employers 
werent hiring new workers or letting employees work more hours 
the productivity increase is being eked out by squeezing down 
on labor sinai said it still shows an anemic performance for 
us productivity growth what businesses are doing in light of 
an anticipated recession is to cut back on jobs and hours worked 
hourly labor costs a major inflation measure for businesses 
shot up at an annual rate of 58 percent for the second quarter of 
1990 far above the 3 percent rise for all of 1989 
meanwhile unit labor costs a key gauge of future price 
inflation rose 43 percent for the second quarter compared with a 
33 percent rise during all of 1989 
increased productivity or getting each worker to produce more 
for each hour he or she works is vital to increasing americans 
standard of living without inflation many economists believe 
tuesdays report provided revised figures on the second quarter 
of 1990 the 15 percent revised increase was slightly below the 
16 percent increase first reported by the labor department 
in the manufacturing sector productivity increased 4 percent 
or double the 2 percent rise for all of 1989 tuesdays report 
said unit labor costs in that sector rose 22 percent the same as 
the 22 percent increase during all of last year 
total business productivity including farming rose 17 percent 
for the second quarter compared with a 02 percent drop for all of 
1989 
since 1982 productivity growth has averaged 14 percent a year 
a slight improvement over the 12 percent average growth rate in 
the 1970s but far below the 33 percent rate of increase posted in 
the two decades after world war ii

the harsh 
conditions of the saudi desert are taking a toll on us military 
equipment affecting simple mechanical gear as well as sensitive 
hightech equipment from m16 rifles to weapons guidance systems 
the warships patrolling the waters around the arabian peninsula 
are also have problems officers and maintenance crews said 
when you buy a stereo what do the instructions say marine 
gunnery sgt tate ingles of miami asked during a recent interview 
they say you should keep it away from heat dust and vibration 
you put the same electrical gear in the saudi desert and well 
there you have it 
because of the heat and sand weapons systems that rely on 
sensitive electronics and computers could be troublesome to operate 
if extended hostilities broke out technicians say 
at eagle forward a base camp for apache gunships and other 
helicopters of the 101st airborne divisions air assault brigade 
the soft saudi sand blown by the desert wind is the big headache 
its unbelievable it gets everywhere a maintenance crew 
member said 
crews are flushing out the apache engines with water every day 
to rid them of the sand the powdery sand also finds its way into 
transmissions and gears that turn the rotors forcing more frequent 
maintenance on those systems as well 
hovering around in the desert is going to be very hard on the 
engines said maj greg maisel of laredo texas the executive 
officer of a marine attack squadron 
helicopters are being fitted with radiator filters much like the 
black wraps often seen on fronts of sports cars 
we were having a lot of overheating problems because of sand 
clogging the radiators squadron leader lt col don cody said 
we think the filters have fixed that 
the sand scours the paint from rotor blades exposing metal that 
glints in the sun making the helicopters easier to spot 
sand is the reason the air force is cutting the time between its 
routine maintenance tests and routine adjustments made every 100 
hours are now being done every 6075 hours an air force official 
said 
one persistent problem is sand clogging airintake valves of jet 
engines much like the apaches the engines of air force and navy 
planes on the ground and aboard carriers are being flushed with 
water daily 
a marine sergeant cleaning his automatic rifle noted 
sometimes im not sure it would fire if i needed it to we train 
in the desert but ive never seen anything like this 
tanks need more frequent filter cleanings and track flushing and 
higher viscosity oil radiators need to be checked constantly to 
prevent overheating 
the sand cakes on headlights and windshields and can get into 
the fuel supply if proper care is not taken 
weapons systems protected from the sand cant escape the 
scorching sun 
within days of arriving here 82nd airborne units were reporting 
dead radios because wires were burned out or fused by the heat 
one officer in the division said monday that parts for the 
radios and other equipment being damaged are getting hard to come 
by were short quite a few things said the officer who spoke 
on condition of anonymity im sure well get them eventually 
meantime ingenuity is helping 
on tuesday two 82nd soldiers were at a safeway supermarket in a 
saudi town cleaning it out of sponges and cloth a vehicle 
containing several tow antitank missiles and other weapons 
exploded at an 82nd motor pool monday and the men suspect heat was 
a factor 
the equipment problems are frustrating but the maintenance 
crews try to keep a sense of humor 
some officer says hey my radio dont work ingles said 
i tell him sir if youd been sitting out here under a 
magnifying glass in 130degree temperatures all day you wouldnt 
work either

plans to fly his ultralight craft the remaining nine miles from the 
farm where he landed monday to the first flight airport next to the 
wright brothers memorial at kitty hawk 
after announcing his plans raymond and his wife aida went 
windsurfing

last nine miles he said 
tomorrow hell set up the plane for anybody who wants to see 
it and then head home to california said nancy mcwilliams of 
kitty hawk kites a hanggliding school and store that has been the 
headquarters for the final portion of the trip 
sam raymond the pilots father said hes glad to see the trip 
is over although his son wanted to achieve his goal of flying to 
kitty hawk 
theres a little bit of disappointment that he didnt get to 
the exact landing point that he wanted the elder raymond said 
raymond had frequently faced weather problems during his 
monthandahalf trip 
his aircraft the sun seeker depends on sunshine and favorable 
wind solar cells produce power for its electric motor which is 
used for takeoffs and landings after takeoff the plane rides 
thermals columns of rising warm air like a glider 
weather forced mondays landing at the farm near the small 
coastal town of spot 
no 1 low visibility was the problem said the elder 
raymond it got down as low as 600 feet and it was raining and a 
storm was building the breezes from the ocean were actually 
pushing him back inland 
raymond 33 first took off july 16 from desert center calif 
about 200 miles east of los angeles beginning his quest to prove 
an ultralight aircraft partly powered by solar energy could cross 
the united states 
two days after the journey began the 198pound craft was 
damaged in an aborted takeoff from lordsburg nm 
the sun seeker raymond and his ground crew returned to lake 
elsinore calif for repairs raymond manufactured and sold 
hanggliding equipment there until six months ago when he devoted 
himself to the sun seeker project 
the sun seeker had better luck after taking off again from 
desert center on aug 2 
raymond a former national hang gliding champion had hoped to 
reach his destination sunday but was delayed by strong head wind 
he logged only 18 miles friday when he landed at virginia tech 
airport at blacksburg va about 25 miles northwest of roanoke va 
raymond flew 124 miles sunday before landing in currituck in 
north carolinas northeastern corner said expedition spokesman

to this sprawling black township southwest of johannesburg 
it was fw de klerks fir klerk greetedst visit to soweto since 
he became 
president last year his predecessor pw botha was the first 
south african head of government to enter the countrys largest 
township a traditional hotbed of black unrest 
since his inauguration de klerk has promoted reforms to end the 
apartheid system of racial segregation and has opened talks with 
the african national congress on sharing power with the black 
majority 
on tuesday he received a warm welcome in the townshsays milt berger 
a public relations man who once worked for 
steeplechase and now represents astroland coney islands only 
multiride park 
and things got worse 
when steeplechase owner frank tilyou died in 1964 the heirs 
wrangled about steeplechases operation until berger says for 
peace and harmonys sake they sold it the buyer was developer 
fred trump father of donald he wanted to put up some big 
seaside condo development berger said 
down came the pavilion of fun and with it the end of a legend 
but trump couldnt get the building variance he needed to 
construct residential housing in an area zoned for amusement the 
60s rolled by and steeplechase sat vacant 
the city condemned it in 1969 after a court battle trump 
reportedly received 4 million for the 12acre parcel about the 
same time the city condemned blocks of redbrick bungalows once 
used as summer homes 
with the 70s came plans to build publichousing projects 
the city had this vision that they would round up a lot of 
lowincome people from the city and bring them out to coney island 
to this paradise says developer bullard and that once here 
all of their problems would be over because theyd be in paradise 
tall boxy buildings sprang up whites fled stores closed the 
vacation trade died nearly taking the entire community with it 
when the urban renewal projects began mermaid avenue was a 
thriving business center with over 400 retail stores today there 
are 39 
coney island says ann weisbrod vice president of the citys 
public development corp was the victim of government good 
intentions 
now the city has a new slate of plans to revive coney island 
among them bullards proposed 350 million steeplechase park and a 
14000seat sportsplex to be used for college and high school 
events 
the proposed new steeplechase covering 25 acres would be a 
threetier park with 65 major attractions 14 theaters and a 3 
million renovated version of the parachute jump 
there are also plans to renovate the subway stop repave local 
streets rebuild bridges leading onto coney island and turn 
stillwell avenue into a pedestrian mall 
the city has committed 20 million to the project thats just 
about enough to build the parking garage says bullard 
if all goes well steeplechase could open in 1993 if approved 
the sportsplex project which is still in the development stage 
could be operating by 1995 
youll never be able to recapture the glory days of old coney 
island says state sen marty solomon who represents the area 
but these projects are giving an awful lot of hope to an area 
that hasnt had any for a long long time

the white house said tuesday its still aiming 
for a 50 billion reduction in next years deficit but is willing 
to listen to proposals for a smaller target 
budget negotiators will resume their deliberations in private 
friday at andrews air force base in suburban washington staying 
closeted there until sunday in the hope of forging an agreement 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
we still believe that we need to get a 50 billion reduction 
in the first year and 500 billion over five years fitzwater 
said we still believe that deficit reduction is important that 
its crucial to maintaining economic growth 
some lawmakers have suggested the steep costs of the big us 
military buildup in the persian gulf as well as the impact of 
rising oil prices on an already sluggish economy may force them to 
scale back the goal of trimming 50 billion from next years 
deficit 
were willing to talk about it and thats what were going to 
the table to do fitzwater said when asked about the possibility 
of a lower target 
the white house he said will have a budget proposal to put on 
the table at andrews and it expects the democrats to do the same 
both sides need to face the hard decisions fitzwater said 
the democratled congress opened talks with the white house in 
may on reducing the deficit but the negotiations came to a 
temporary halt in early august with little progress evident 
bush agreed june 26 that tax revenue increases were 
necessary but even after he broke his nonewtaxes vow and the 
republicans tentatively pushed forward a package of tax increases 
the democrats refused to propose a matching package of cuts in 
entitlement programs and other spending 
bush met with his cabinet on tuesday and budget director 
richard darman outlined the sequester scenario looming over the 
government unless a budget agreement is reached before oct 1 the 
start of the 1991 fiscal year federal agencies are girding for 
possible layoffs 
fitzwater reiterated that bush will not sign legislation 
forestalling a sequester or softening the grammrudman deficit 
reduction targets unless he and the congress reach an overall 
spending accord 
the white house and congressional delegations led by darman 
and house majority leader richard gephardt dmo will resume 
their talks friday spending the entire weekend at the base 
bush will leave friday night from andrews for his summit sunday 
in helsinki finland with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
fitzwater said if the weekend budget negotiations succeed bush 
will meet with the top leaders of congress to hammer out a final 
agreement 
under the grammrudman law there will be automatic 
acrosstheboard cuts in many federal programs beginning oct 1 
unless the projected deficit is 64 billion or lower 
the latest estimate from darmans office is that the 1991 
deficit will be 169 billion or 231 billion if the costs of the 
savings and loan bailout are added in higher oil prices and 
escalating pentagon costs are likely to produce even more red ink

businesses should play a greater role in 
improving schools by investing more dollars and personnel to boost 
quality and prepare students for the workforce a nationwide poll 
said tuesday 
the roper organization poll commissioned by an affiliate of the 
us chamber of commerce found 96 percent of americans with 
children in public school as well as 91 percent of all americans 
are concerned about the quality of education in their communities 
threequarters of those polled agreed that public schools are 
failing to prepare students for jobs now available sixtythree 
percent said most students will lack skills for jobs in the future 
most of the 1003 adult americans polled over the telephone last 
month were receptive to the involvement of business in local public 
education ninetyone percent said it is a good idea for business 
to provide equipment to schools while 6 percent thought it was a 
bad idea and 2 percent didnt know 
eightyfive percent want business to pay the cost of putting in 
a course to teach certain technical skills while 12 percent were 
against the idea and 3 percent didnt know eighty percent said 
business should give employees time off to teach a course in the 
school system compared with 15 percent against and 4 percent 
undecided 
seventytwo percent called on business to take the lead in 
improving community schools and 65 percent wanted business leaders 
to run for school boards 
it is interesting to note that the american public considers 
the business community the education safety net for the nation 
said edward donley chairman of the chambers center for workforce 
preparation and quality education 
business clearly has been given the mandate to lead the way to 
better public schools and to help education in general said 
donley 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
agreed that businesses should become more involved in public 
schools but warned against an inclination to avoid key issues that 
affect the quality of education 
where was business when president bush vetoed the family and 
medical leave act where was business during discussions about 
national health care or expanding preschool these healthcare 
issues are important to kids learning said geiger 
businesses cant just pick and choose where they will get 
active he said 
the roper poll was designed to reflect public opinion with a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points

president mikhail s gorbachevs reform program is 
on the brink of collapse a leader of the communist partys 
traditionalist wing told 2500 delegates at a russian party 
congress in the kremlin on tuesday 
ivan k polozkov first secretary of the communist party in the 
russian republic drew vigorous applause from the delegates a 
group that includes many generals and career party officials who 
are believed to harbor reservations about gorbachevs policies 
gorbachev sat on the podium at the front of the hall remaining 
virtually silent through a day of speeches that often contained 
scathing criticism of his leadership though without mentioning him 
by name 
some of the days strongest applause went to ivan vtorushin a 
worker from the siberian city of tyumen who called for returning 
the nation to 1985 the year in which gorbachev assumed power 
no matter what slogans are used a policy resulting in falling 
living standards and bloodshed is against popular interests 
vtorushin said referring to the soviet unions accelerating 
economic problems and ethnic strife 
the delegates are meeting this week to complete the process of 
creating a separate russian branch of the communist party 
until this year the russian republic the largest of the soviet 
unions 15 constituent republics did not have its own party 
organization communists living in russia were simply members of 
the soviet party headed by gorbachev 
the first meeting of the new russian communist party held in 
moscow in june was dominated by traditionalists and was widely 
viewed in the soviet union as an effort by them to gain influence 
and public support 
since june three reformist delegates have resigned their seats 
in the congress because of its domination by traditionalists 
another reformer economist otto latsis announced at tuesdays 
session that he was resigning in protest from a committee drafting 
the partys platform 
reformists also made some other moves on tuesday such as 
calling unsuccessfully for the resignation of the 55yearold 
polozkov but for the most part the session was again dominated by 
traditionalists 
in his hourlong keynote address polozkov urged delegates to 
counter the deliberate discrediting of the communist party and 
the socialist choice as a whole 
he said the countrys economic crisis caused by the soviet 
peoples psychological unpreparedness for a marketbased system 
is in the final analysis putting perestroika on the brink of 
collapse 
his comments echoed complaints expressed monday by muscovites 
who stood in line across the city to buy bread which had been one 
of the few foods soviet consumers could obtain easily 
it is now in short supply across moscow for the first time since 
the early 1960s despite a record grain harvest izvestia and 
moskovskaya pravda blamed the shortage on moscows bakeries which 
they said could not keep up with demand 
thats perestroika were not moving forward forward were 
going backward said viktor lyubeznov one frustrated shopper 
monday 
among other speakers at the russian party congress was the head 
of the kgb in the moscow region vitaly prilukov who lamented the 
atrophying of power in the soviet union and said the national 
party had willingly allowed antisocialist structures to seize 
the initiative 
despite the complaints polozkov said later at a news conference 
that he is convinced there is no going back to the way things 
were before gorbachev 
the delegates are just wondering whats happening with 
five years of perestroika and no improvements he said

sen sam nunn of georgia has relaxed his 
longheld antiabortion position and now says he believes the 
abortion decision should be left to the informed conscience of 
the mother in most cases 
nunn frequently mentioned as a potential democratic 
presidential candidate in 1992 said he favors prohibiting abortion 
only when the fetus is viable or capable of living outside the 
womb 
in a letter to be sent to constituents who write him about the 
abortion issue nunn wrote i favor leaving the decision prior to 
viability to the informed conscience of the mother and prohibiting 
abortions after viability except in cases where the life of the 
mother is threatened 
in the past nunn was a supporter of proposed constitutional 
amendments to overturn the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion 
nunn was not available for comment tuesday his press secretary 
scott williams said the senators shift on abortion did not signal 
any change in nunns announced position that he has no plans at 
this time to seek the presidency 
in the letter nunn said he still considers abortion a tragedy 
and an act of great moral consequence that should be strongly 
discouraged except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of 
the mother is endangered 
but he said laws prohibiting early abortions cannot be enforced 
because legalized abortion has been the law of the land since the 
1973 supreme court decision 
i do not believe that large segments of the american people 
and the medical profession will accept or obey a law making 
earlyterm abortions a criminal act after all those years nunn 
wrote 
the law can only accomplish so much and with respect to 
abortion i believe the only enforceable line the law can draw is 
to protect the unborn child when it is clear an independent life is 
involved nunn said 
but he added i hope we have not reached the point in this 
country when anything that is not prohibited by law is considered 
morally and ethically acceptable

navy officials reading from a pentagon announcement said the 
boarding took place after the vessel refused orders from the 
goldsborough to either return to its port of origin or proceed to a 
nonprohibited port 
shipping sources in the region had said the vessel en route 
from sri lanka was stopped before it could reach the strait of 
hormuz the gateway to the persian gulf 
the team met no resistance and they will remain aboard the 
ship until it reaches its due destination the pentagon statement 
said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the us navy 
stopped and boarded the tealaden iraqiflagged freighter in the 
gulf of oman as part of the trade embargo against iraq 
the ship was ordered to divert it did not divert it was then 
boarded and now has diverted the spokesman said we dont have 
information now on where its being diverted to 
tuesdays incident was the first publicly acknowledged boarding 
by us forces of an iraqiflagged vessel since the un embargo 
was clamped on iraq last month but us military sources speaking 
on condition of anonymity indicated that might not be the case 
they said pentagon listings show more than 450 vessels have been 
challenged by radio by us warships and that less than 20 had 
been boarded and less than five diverted 
when pressed as to whether other iraqflagged vessels were 
involved they said the records were not broken down by nationality 
the only other ship publicly reported to have been boarded by 
us forces and subsequently prevented from docking was the 
91478ton kota wirama managed by the pacific international lines 
of singapore 
that vessel was intercepted in the red sea on aug 28 boarded 
and searched and then prevented from proceeding to the jordanian 
port of aqaba 
shipping executives said the vessel was suspected of carrying 
chemicals destined for iraq 
warning shots were fired across the bows of two iraqiflagged 
tankers on aug 18 when defense secretary dick cheney was visiting 
the area the two tankers were empty

he didnt make it to historic 
kitty hawk but pilot eric raymond on tuesday celebrated the first 
transcontinental flight in a solarpowered plane by going sailing 
i hope this will help enlighten people to the potential of 
solar power and alternative energy sources raymond said of his 
2467mile flight 
raymond 33 said winds prevented a kitty hawk landing but were 
good for sailboarding 
raymonds sun seeker ultralight aircraft was safe from the wind 
in a shed at the farm he landed monday nine miles short of the 
wright brothers memorial 
if i had an hour more time monday i could have made it in 
raymond said as he relaxed on a beach not far from kitty hawk 
where the wright brothers pioneered powered flight 
low visibility rain and unfavorable wind forced him to land at 
the farm near the community of spot about 500 yards from currituck 
sound which separates the mainland from the offshore barrier 
island where kitty hawk and kill devil hills are located 
the sun seeker depends on sunshine and favorable wind solar 
cells produce power for its electric motor which is used for 
takeoffs and landings after takeoff the plane rides thermals 
columns of rising warm air like a glider 
raymond said tuesdays 35 mph northeasterly gusts would create 
turbulence around the trees surrounding the airstrip at the wright 
memorial 
i wouldnt want to land there with more than 10 or 12 mph 
winds he said 
raymond said the trip took a bit longer than i expected but 
thats because it was against the wind i expected to have 
prevailing westerlies but instead it was more easterly 
two weeks was raymonds goal for completing the trip but wind 
and weather delays stretched the trip to 32 days including 23 days 
in the air he took off from desert center calif about 200 miles 
east of los angeles 
raymond said the rigors of flying and the attraction of the 
beach and good sailboarding weather were enough to call him off 
work for a day 
he said he liked sailboarding because you have a clean 
endless source of energy you can wind surf at 30 mph all day long 
i like anything thats natural like that that doesnt pollute 
he said he would set his plane up for people to see wednesday 
before driving home to california 
his father sam raymond said hes glad the trip is over 
although his son wanted to achieve his goal of flying to the 
monument 
theres a little bit of disappointment that he didnt get to 
the exact landing point that he wanted the elder raymond said 
raymond first took off july 16 from desert center to prove an 
aircraft partly powered by solar energy could cross the united 
states two days later the 198pound craft was damaged in an 
aborted takeoff from lordsburg nm 
the sun seeker raymond and his ground crew returned by land to 
lake elsinore calif for repairs raymond manufactured and sold 
hang gliding equipment there until six months ago when he devoted 
himself to the sun seeker project 
the former national hanggliding champion took off again from 
desert center on aug 2

more than 40000 ragged asian refugees 
from kuwait and iraq fought for bread and water tuesday in a 
sweltering desert camp as jordanian troops struggled to impose 
order 
were fighting because were hungry and thirsty if they dont 
move us out of here soon we will all die complained ahmed saed 
a whitebearded pakistani 
hani tamini a sturdy young man of about 30 from bangladesh 
said ive had no food today none yesterday and very little the 
day before that its better to die rather than fight like this for 
a scrap of bread 
another man wailed ive been trying for three days to get 
some food for my children and wife and i havent been able to get 
any 
the camp is in the baking hot desert at shaalan between the 
iraqi frontier and the jordanian border post of ruweishid 50 miles 
inside jordan 
it is used as a staging post for the tens of thousands of 
asians most of them penniless fleeing kuwait 
they have been allowed to cross into jordan but are not allowed 
through the border post because jordan wants guarantees the 
refugees governments will repatriate them 
jordan burdened by an 8 billion national debt has been 
swamped by more than 420000 refugees since iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait the nations social services are strained to their 
breaking point 
crown prince hassan who visited the camps two days ago accused 
the international community tuesday of not doing enough to help 
jordan or the refugees 
he told a news conference in amman that the situation may soon 
become critical for the people he called the downtrodden of the 
earth 
more than 100000 impoverished asians are stranded at ruweishid 
and the makeshift desert camps food is scarce some people have 
died 
at shaalan tuesday thousands of men and women pushed and 
scuffled beside a large trailer truck from which jordanian 
officials and soldiers were trying to distribute food rations a 
round piece of flat arab bread one tomato and one cucumber per 
person 
the crush was so great the frazzled soldiers began flaying the 
refugees with belts and sticks yelling at them to stop fighting 
and get in line 
but again and again as soon as some semblance of a line was 
formed there was a fresh rush on the food truck as the thousands 
of people at the back of the line screaming and stretching out 
their hands stampeded to get closer before the food ran out 
it went on for hours 
when the pandemonium subsided refugees scavenged in the sand 
for crushed remnants of bread tomatoes and cucumbers 
its not easy to control people who are hungry and thirsty 
said suleyman bakr one of five jordanian doctors manning a medical 
tent 
we need more food more water and better organization but 
whats needed more than anything is to get these people to their 
countries as soon as possible he said most of the refugees are 
from bangladesh pakistan india sri lanka the philippines and 
thailand 
about a quarter of the people at ruweishid are jammed into small 
army tents most lie on the sand with little protection from the 
sun 
some refugees have been in the camp for nearly two weeks there 
is little sanitation 
it would have been better to stay in iraq and face death 
there rather than die in this terrible stink hole in the desert 
said one bangladeshi

the american bar associations judicial 
screening panel tuesday gave supreme court nominee david h souter 
its highest rating for professional qualifications to sit on the 
nations highest court 
the wellqualified rating is reserved for those who meet the 
highest standards of integrity professional competence and 
judicial temperament according to the guidebook followed by the 
15member standing committee on federal judiciary 
the committee vote was unanimous the panel said in a letter to 
the justice department 
the rating is expected to give a boost to souters nomination 
scheduled to be taken up sept 13 by the senate judiciary committee 
still souter is expected to be questioned closely about his 
judicial philosophy and senators are expected to try to probe his 
views on the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion 
souter received a similar wellqualified rating before being 
confirmed earlier this year to sit on the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals in boston but the aba panel applies different standards 
for supreme court nominees 
as part of the mostrecent aba study two teams of law 
professors at stanford and northwestern universities reviewed 
souters legal writings as a new hampshire supreme court judge and 
new hampshire state attorney general 
another review was conducted for the aba by a group of lawyers 
headed by former solicitor general rex lee now president of 
brigham young university 
the legal writings of souter a rhodes scholar who graduated 
from harvard law school provide few clues to his thinking on such 
pressing issues as abortion but conservative groups have expressed 
satisfaction with president bushs choice 
the chairman of the aba panel ralph i lancaster jr told 
deputy attorney general william p barr of the rating in a brief 
letter released by the justice department 
attorney general dick thornburgh attending a law enforcement 
conference in seoul south korea issued a statement saying the 
rating confirms that bush has selected a man of superb intellect 
and qualifications 
the white house also welcomed the abas seal of approval 
the president is pleased to receive this news and looks 
forward to a speedy confirmation said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
arthur j kropp president of the liberal people for the 
american way said the rating comes as no surprise 
souters technical qualifications were never in question 
kropp said in a statement what the souter nomination will turn 
on is his judicial philosophy which the abas rating does not 
account for 
people for the american way which helped defeat robert borks 
nomination for the supreme court three years ago plans to issue a 
report on souters record at the outset of the senate hearings 
the aba ratings have been a source of controversy in the past 
the panel split in 1987 over bork with 10 members voting to rate 
him well qualified while four others found him not 
qualified another member voted not opposed to bork 
the senate defeated borks nomination after a bitter fight led 
by a coalition of civil rights and abortion rights activists

when an army truck broke 
down recently in the middle of this west bank town palestinian 
teenagers sprang into action 
they trashed it said an israeli army officer who witnessed 
the scene they broke every window smashed every door and 
fender 
the incident was a reminder that the palestinian revolt against 
israeli occupation though eclipsed by the gulf crisis persists as 
an angry war of stones and empty bottles against wellarmed israeli 
troops 
the uprising known in arabic as the intefadeh marks its 
1000th day wednesday the plobacked underground leadership of the 
revolt called for the anniversary to be marked with protest marches 
under the banner intefadeh until a palestinian state 
that goal remains illusive for the 17 million palestinians in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip and the character of the 
struggle is changing amid a more restrained israeli military policy 
and the impact of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
palestinian support for iraqi leader saddam hussein has 
disappointed the united states and other western nations that tried 
to mediate the israelipalestinian conflict 
theres no doubt that israel is reaping political gains from 
the gulf crisis said ghassan khatib a palestinian professor 
from this town just north of jerusalem 
there are fewer pressures on israel from the united states to 
start a dialogue with the palestinians khatib said there is 
no more talk about israeli violations of human rights in the 
occupied territories 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday dismissed 
reporters questions about the anniversary 
it doesnt have any impact on the progress of the jewish 
people and the jewish state shamir said 
since the revolt began in december 1987 a total of 728 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in 
addition 255 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaboration with israel fortyseven israelis 
have died 
in recent months according to both palestinians and israeli 
army officials there has been a marked slowdown in the uprising 
under defense minister moshe arens the army since june has 
reduced its forces in heavily populated areas and tightened firing 
rules sharply reducing palestinian casualties 
in the past three months 11 palestinians have died from israeli 
army gunfire in the same period last year the toll was 77 
it reflects more experience by the army in handling the 
situation said an army spokesman who cannot be identified by 
name under military rules troops are positioned so there is less 
friction with the local population 
meanwhile the palestinian side shows signs of fatigue from the 
almost weekly general strikes ordered by uprising leaders and 
forced closures by the army 
our business barely feeds our family said zaki musleh a 
60yearold carpenter with a shop on ramallahs palestine street 
no one has any money 
muslehs shop like many others is short one worker his 
28yearold son bassam is in army custody one of more than 910 
palestinians held without charge or trial under military 
administrative detention rules 
some 9015 other palestinians also are in jail charged or 
awaiting trial or sentenced for antiisraeli crimes the army says 
palestinians remain resilient despite the revolts failure to 
achieve its main political goal of getting the israelis out of the 
territories they seized in the 1967 middle east war 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab said he believes the main 
achievement of the intefadeh has been a change in palestinian 
attitudes 
palestinians are no longer thinking as an occupied people 
they are thinking as a people resisting occupation he said 
that is why the uprising will continue 
in ramallahs kadura refugee camp 29yearold truck driver ziad 
zmekna points to greater international awareness of the 
palestinians plight as another gain from the uprising 
zmeknas life is a measure of palestinian determination one of 
his brothers is jailed another is hiding from authorities and 
zmekna himself has lost his drivers license for failure to pay 
income taxes to the israelis 
he points to a photo on his wall the wedding portrait of a 
palestinian friend killed by israeli troops last year 
the intefadeh will continue for our martyrs it will continue 
for us zmekna said this is our national duty

treasury secretary nicholas brady expressed 
optimism as he began a global search tuesday for billions of 
dollars in international assistance to support the campaign against 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
the diplomatic and military branches are well in place what 
needs to be put in place now is the economic branch brady told 
reporters aboard his plane adding that he was looking forward to a 
most successful trip 
brady was leading one of two highlevel delegations dispatched 
by president bush to ask americas allies to help defray the cost 
of the us military buildup in the persian gulf and to provide 
assistance to allies hurt by the trade embargo against iraq 
while previous reports have put the possible firstyear price 
tag for the assistance package at 25 billion officials traveling 
with brady indicated the final amount could go higher 
brady met first with french finance minister pierre beregovoy 
and then with french foreign minister roland dumas 
speaking to reporters at the french foreign ministry brady 
called the discussions very successful 
but neither brady nor dumas would say whether any agreements 
were reached on americas request for added financial assistance 
but brady did say we were very pleased with dumas 
reaction 
there is diplomatic support there is military support and now 
we have the job of providing economic support brady said before 
departing 
following the paris meetings brady was to fly to london for 
talks wednesday with british prime minister margaret thatcher 
in a trip that will span 30 time zones over four days the brady 
delegation was also scheduled to meet with south korean president 
roh taewoo and japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
on wednesday secretary of state james a baker iii will leave 
washington on a similar pledgeseeking mission first to the 
oilrich countries of the middle east and later to west germany and 
italy 
the bush administration has a lot riding on its fund drive it 
fears that without a substantial flow of economic assistance in the 
form of cash loans and loan guarantees third world nations 
especially hurt by the loss of trade with iraq will violate the 
embargo 
the administration is counting on the trade embargo to force 
iraq to withdraw from kuwait without using american troops to force 
a rollback 
officials speaking to reporters on bradys flight from 
washington to paris said that a critical need was to get 
commitments for 10 billion or more to provide assistance to 
turkey jordan and egypt the three countries in the middle east 
suffering the most economically from a loss of trade opportunities 
with iraq and other turmoil in the region 
one official who spoke on the condition his name not be used 
said the united states was seeking whatever resources were needed 
to help the three countries 
you have got to finance that one way or the other he said 
in addition the official said the brady mission would be 
discussing support for the us military buildup which was costing 
an estimated 46 million a day 
congressional critics have pressed bush to get commitments to 
defray the impact on the us budget deficit of defending the 
persian gulf oil resources especially from such economic 
powerhouses as japan and west germany 
bush and other members of the national security council reviewed 
a proposal last week that carried a 23 billion price tag over the 
first year with 10 billion of that earmarked to ease the economic 
pain for countries supporting the trade embargo and the other 13 
billion going to the us military to pay for such costs as 
transportation housing and fuel 
other reports have put the figure at 25 billion but the 
official traveling with brady said any number cited now would very 
likely be revised upward given the changing nature of the 
situation 
the official said that other third world countries including 
the emerging democracies in eastern europe as well as nations such 
as brazil and the philippines would likely receive economic 
assistance from the international package being assembled the 
money would be used to compensate them for the rising world price 
of oil the official said

soldiers fired on thousands of 
angry blacks tuesday and rival gangs fought with axes knives and 
spears as at least 40 people were killed in township violence 
the violence came as president fw de klerk and african 
national congress leader nelson mandela visited black townships 
near johannesburg to call for a halt in fighting that has killed 
more than 550 people since aug 12 
the government has imposed emergency restrictions and sent elite 
army units to the townships but fighting between zulu followers of 
the conservative inkatha movement and other blacks loyal to the anc 
raged for a fourth week 
in sebokeng a predawn clash killed four people at a migrant 
workers hostel police said the victims were believed to be 
township residents abducted by hostel dwellers 
about 5000 township residents angered by the killings gathered 
at the hostel police said 
when the mob refused to disperse army troops were called in and 
a shooting incident occurred said police col frans malherbe 
the bodies of 11 persons were found after the mob dispersed 
south african newspaper photographer n khumalo told the south 
african press association that people came toward the soldiers 
waving their hands saying peace we are not fighting some of 
them even sat down

maybe they wanted to scare the people khumalo was quoted as 
saying all of a sudden there was shooting many of the people 
ran some of the people fell 
the shooting marked the first time soldiers have been involved 
in a clash that has resulted in a loss of lives since they were 
deployed last month in the townships 
in march police opened fire on black demonstrators in sebokeng 
killing at least five and wounding more than 150 a judicial 
inquiry criticized police for the killings saying gunfire was 
unjustified 
malherbe said both police and military were investigating 
tuesdays shootings 
a later police report tuesday put the sebokeng death toll at 36 
with the other killings occurring in sporadic clashes near the 
hostel and adjacent areas police said more than 150 people were 
arrested

axes spears and other crude weapons police fired tear gas and 
shotguns to keep the groups apart 
mandela visited sebokeng on tuesday afternoon and said he was 
outraged after viewing bodies at a mortuary 
the anc deputy president repeated his accusation that police 
fueled the violence by siding with inkatha fighters but he also 
said police arrested more than 100 inkatha supporters including 
youth leader themba khoza 
he later spoke in xhosa to a crowd of township residents and 
appealed for calm then met with law and order minister adriaan 
vlok neither man issued a statement afterward 
on monday mandela called for an independent investigation of 
police actions in the townships similar to the one that followed 
the sebokeng shootings in march 
de klerk has ordered vlok to investigate the charges of police 
bias he and other officials have said some individuals may have 
acted improperly 
vlok said tuesday that government opponents were waging an 
orchestrated campaign to discredit the police 
de klerk made his first visit as president to the soweto 
township southwest of johannesburg where more than 100 people have 
died in factional fighting 
youths mobbed the president and shouted viva de klerk at 
one stop he visited a migrant worker hostel where recent battles 
have occurred 
de klerk later told a news conference conditions in the hostels 
were unacceptable and that the government would spend millions 
of dollars for housing and education in the townships 
the ancinkatha feud has claimed about 5000 lives since 1986 in 
the eastern province of natal where most of the blacks are zulus 
the fighting spread to johannesburg area townships this month 
mandela and zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi have been 
criticized for failing to stop the carnage 
buthelezi has called for a meeting with mandela but the anc has 
refused mandela said monday the problem could not be solved by 
individuals

the new york city subway system has a new 
advertising slogan were coming back so you come back 
brian watkins an annual visitor from provo utah came back 
once too often he was waiting in a midtown manhattan station 
sunday night when a group of youths robbed his father and punched 
his mother watkins fought back and one of the youths stabbed him 
to death 
eight teenagers were arrested monday and charged with murder 
and robbery police said 
watkins slaying was one more disaster for the nations largest 
subway system which began the century as an engineering marvel and 
seems destined to end it as a social disaster 
the blood stain in the seventh avenue station had faded tuesday 
but not the disgust over what had happened there 
like watkins dockery clark of greensboro nc also came to 
new york for the us open tennis tournament she said she had been 
mugged in the station next to the one where watkins died 
two guys jumped me beat my back and stole my watch and 
bracelet she told the daily news my boyfriend saw mayor 
david dinkins at the tournament walked up to him and told him 
his city is a cesspool 
carolina brani another open spectator lives in milan but she 
was clear about one thing i know the subway is never safe day 
or night there is no difference 
crime is rising throughout new york city and rising even faster 
in the subways last year subway felonies increased 18 percent 
while reported major crimes rose 4 percent in the city as a whole 
watkins slaying was the 18th this year in the subway system 
versus 20 in all of 1989 and robberies are up 29 percent 
the fact that less than 3 percent of all city crime occurs in 
the subways is of scant comfort to most riders 
people are not moved by statistics said thomas reppetto 
director of the citizens crime commission a privately financed 
citizens group too many things have happened down there to too 
many people 
brian watkins was no victiminwaiting he had ridden the 
subways many times before he was in the company of four other 
people including two men it was not that late midtown at 1020 
pm is as busy as some cities at noon and the station at seventh 
avenue and 53rd street is not one of the more dangerous 
to many the brazen attack on the watkins family merely confirms 
a visceral sense of subterranean danger 
most stations are dirty smelly noisy and dimly lit the 
transit authority has closed station newsstands reduced token 
booth hours and cut offhours service on some lines 
the agencys police department has been nagged by scandals and 
in august it ran out of money in a special city fund for paying 
overtime for police officers on subway robbery patrol 
for a lot of people to go down into a cavern is a little 
frightening no matter what said reppetto but when they see 
homeless people living there and disorderly people they feel that 
things are not under control 
after steadily increasing for several years ridership has 
declined only about a quarter of city residents ride the subway 
each day and to many such a trip has become virtually unthinkable 
a few years ago thenpolice commissioner benjamin ward admitted his 
wife had never taken the subway 
during the past five years graffiti has been vastly reduced 
trains are more punctual and the transit authority has several 
billion dollars to spend on further improvements the level of 
service used to be intolerable said gene russianoff a mass 
transit advocate now its tolerably bad 
but many riders past and present feel that what really makes 
the subways dangerous are some of the people in them people as 
callous as the ones who allegedly attacked the watkins family and 
then headed off to the roseland ballroom for some dancing 
there are a lot of proposals out there for improving safety in 
the subways said russianoff im afraid none of them would 
have helped mr watkins

a delegation of us senators led by sen robert 
dole met with boris n yeltsin on tuesday and discussed arms 
control taxation and the shortageplagued soviet economy 
dole rkan and his fellow republican senators planned to meet 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at the kremlin on wednesday 
before returning to the united states 
yeltsin the president of the russian republic is locked in a 
struggle with gorbachev over the pace of reform in the soviet 
union he expressed interest in talking with the senators about 
several issues including arms control and taxation 
we here in russia are just beginning to tackle these issues 
yeltsin said as the meeting began it would be interesting for us 
to know your points of view and what you would advise 
yeltsin made reference to his republics effort to wrest more 
control over its affairs from the central soviet government led by 
gorbachev 
we are beginning to have some doubt about whether the 
legislation for things like taxation by the central government is 
the right one he told the senators so were going to pass our 
own laws 
dole was joined on the trip by fellow republicans john warner of 
virginia alfonse damato of new york connie mack of florida don 
nickles of oklahoma steven symms of idaho and jake garn of utah 
dole mentioned some of the topics on his agenda during a brief 
airport news conference 
were very interested to see how the economic reforms are 
coming along and also to get the views of mr gorbachev in 
particular on the crisis in the gulf he said 
dole also spoke about this weekends upcoming summit in finland 
between gorbachev and president bush he said the superpowers 
should coordinate their efforts in the persian gulf to avoid 
misunderstandings 
my view is theres probably some soviet apprehension about the 
buildup of us forces in the gulf dole said thus far the 
soviets have been very cooperative and supportive 
whether or not president bush will make a direct appeal to mr 
gorbachev about additional military force on behalf of the 
russians i dont know he added but it should be a very 
candid discussion because so far its pretty topheavy american in 
the gulf crisis 
warner added we shall also discuss with mr gorbachev the 
status and the role of the soviet military advisers that were in 
the gulf with iraqi forces just before the invasion and as far as

jury selection began tuesday in the retrial of 
three men accused of riot in the 1986 howard beach attack in which 
a gang of whites chased a black man to his death 
william bollander 21 and james povinelli and thomas farino 
both 20 were convicted of riot two years ago but those 
convictions were overturned by an appeals court which ruled the 
trial judge made errors that hurt the defense 
that trial was the second stemming from the dec 20 1986 death 
of michael griffith 23 
griffith and two other blacks were attacked after they walked 
into the predominantly white howard beach section of queens when 
their car broke down 
a gang of whites chased griffith onto the belt parkway where he 
was struck by a car and killed three teenagers were convicted of 
manslaughter in the first trial 
there will be some similarities with the two earlier cases 
victim cedric sandiford is expected to be the key government 
witness and defense lawyers will argue their clients were not part 
of the mob that attacked the blacks 
the appeals court ruled that state supreme court justice thomas 
demakos erred when he refused to give the jury the option of 
convicting the three on the lesser charge of disorderly conduct 
demakos will preside over the retrial

irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh 
sought a rehearing tuesday of the split federal appeals court 
decision that set aside former white house aide oliver l norths 
three felony convictions 
the independent counsel petitioned the threejudge panel which 
voted 21 to vacate norths convictions to reconsider its decision 
and suggested that the full 12member court hear the case 
in a tartly worded petition walsh accused circuit judges 
laurence silberman and david sentelle of incorrect legal analysis 
and a plain misreading of the record of norths trial to reach 
their decision 
on july 20 they ordered a witness by witness hearing to 
determine if the evidence against north had been influenced by the 
testimony he gave congress about the irancontra affair under a 
limited grant of immunity from prosecution 
that socalled use immunity grant barred walsh from using 
norths testimony as evidence in a criminal prosecution 
but walsh called the panels order an unwarranted extension of 
use immunity protection that was particularly unjustified 
because his office took special precautions to ensure that 
prosecutors were not exposed to norths testimony 
the restrictions on the use by prosecutors of immunized 
testimony do not extend to the independent conduct of thirdparty 
witnesses particularly witnesses who testify on the basis of 
personal knowledge walsh said 
to meet the appellate judges requirements it would be 
necessary to probe the psychological processes of each witness 
many of whom are irrelevant to the conviction walsh said 
quoting from the dissenting opinion of chief judge patricia 
wald walsh said the hearing would make virtually impossible 
the criminal prosecution of a person who provides public immunized 
testimony 
the former national security council aide was convicted of 
aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress altering or 
destroying nsc documents and accepting an illegal gratuity the 
construction of a security fence around his home 
north was fined 150000 and ordered to perform 1200 hours of 
community service 
if allowed to stand the appellate court decision also 
jeopardizes the five felony convictions of poindexter who was 
sentenced to six months in prison for lying to congress about 
covert assistance to the nicaraguan contras and the sale of us 
arms to iran 
walsh also attacked the panels reversal of norths conviction 
for destroying or altering government documents the panel held 
that the jury should have been told it could consider the fact that 
north thought he was not acting illegally when he destroyed 
documents 
this reasoning effectively places government records at the 
mercy of officially directed coverups walsh said 
walsh could have bypassed the appellate court and gone directly 
to the supreme court to seek reinstatement of norths conviction 
but he chose a more cautious approach of returning to the appellate 
court and seeking reconsideration of its decision 
he needs the votes of seven judges to win a rehearing of the 
case by the full court walsh apparently calculated that he could 
win the votes of three new members of the court appointed by 
president bush in addition to four liberal judges who were 
appointed by president carter 
silberman and sentelle are among a group of five conservative 
judges appointed by president reagan

a new vehicle with legs and feet instead of 
wheels is being developed to prowl forests a mechanical big foot 
the agriculture department said tuesday will soon undergo field 
tests 
the vehicle will soon be strolling about the woods of 
southwest virginia near blacksburg home of virginia polytechnic 
institute and state university one of the machines developers 
the department said 
products technologist robert koeppen of the forest service said 
the machine could solve some forest management problems while 
helping protect forest ecosystems 
currently forest managers depend on rubbertired vehicles 
which can cause soil compaction rutting or damage to vegetation 
the agency said wheeled vehicles also are limited by terrain that 
is too rough steep wet or soft 
the machine called the robotic walking vehicle may 
alleviate such problems for example it can move sideways a 
maneuver koeppen said may help drastically reduce damage to forest 
soils and vegetation 
a public unveiling of the machine has been scheduled for sept 
11 at virginia polytechnic with field tests to begin later this 
month the tests will include the machines performance on level 
mountainous and simulate lowlying wetland terrain

palestinian guerrilla leader abul abbas 
said tuesday his group will not attack us targets in the middle 
east unless american forces strike at iraq 
our interests lie in a peaceful settlement of the gulf 
crisis he told reporters at his heavily guarded headquarters in 
downtown baghdad 
for the time being we dont want to give the americans an 
excuse to launch an attack against iraq he added but if the 
americans wage a battle it will be a fierce one and all their 
interests in the region will be within our reach 
the guerrilla leader whose real name is mohammed abbas heads 
the palestine liberation front a small radical group within 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
the group was behind the october 1985 hijacking of the italian 
cruise liner achille lauro in which an elderly american passenger 
leon klinghoffer was murdered 
the plf also mounted an abortive seaborne raid on israel in may 
which led president bush to suspend the uss 18month dialogue 
with the plo 
western governments have been preparing for terrorist attacks by 
arab militants aligned with baghdad since us forces and their 
allies rushed to the aid of saudi arabia following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
abbas sitting below a large poster showing him with iraqi 
president saddam hussein said he expects the americans to use 
some of their stooges in the region to attack american targets 
and then blame it on iraq 
he said the americans would use that as a pretext to 
strike iraq 
he said palestinians back saddam because he stood up to israel 
and its western allies 
he said saddams aug 12 proposal to leave kuwait if israel 
withdrew from the occupied west bank and gaza strip and the 
americans left the persian gulf is the first time the palestinian 
issue has been linked to the worlds need for energy and oil

president ion iliescu on wednesday 
accused the united states and other western countries of waging an 
economic war against romania by blocking loans to the financially 
strapped country 
iliescu made his remarks to romanian television during the 
second day of an official visit to yugoslavia 
he said certain american interests which he did not name 
dictated us policy toward his country 
pressures have been exerted on western banks to make them 
withhold loans to romania iliescu said without going into 
specifics 
this represents an economic war impossible to understand he 
said 
romanians have no illusions as to western aid iliescu said 
he added that romania might find more beneficial economic 
cooperation with countries of similar size and interests 
in contrast he noted that the west gave preferential treatment 
to nicolae ceausescu the communist dictator toppled and executed 
in december despite his repression of his countrymen 
iliescu was alluding to the most favored nation trading status 
granted by the united states to romania for years as a reward for 
ceausescus relative independence particularly in foreign policy 
from the soviet union exports of countries with most favored 
status are subject to lower us tariffs 
romania lost its most favored nation status in 1988 when 
ceausescu still held power 
last week senate minority leader robert dole rkan visited 
bucharest with a senate delegation dole insisted congress will 
have to be satisfied that romanias human rights record is 
exemplary before restoring its most favored nation status and 
allocating largescale aid 
dole said he was concerned about mass arrests made after 
antigovernment demonstrations delays in issuing passports and the 
continuing state monopoly over the mass media 
 
the united states and the european community froze all but 
humanitarian aid to romanian in june romania has the weakest 
economy and lowest living standards in the east bloc 
the aid cutoff was in response to a twoday rampage by loyalist 
miners who answered iliescus call for help in putting down violent 
antigovernment protests the miners beat up journalists and 
pedestrians and raided the offices of antigovernment parties 
iliescu a former senior communist official who broke with 
ceausescu has repeatedly stated his commitment to democracy and 
economic reform 
iliescus national salvation front came to power during the 
revolution that ousted ceausescu the front won an overwhelming 
victory in mays multiparty elections 
opposition leaders suspect iliescu and other key figures in the 
front of continuing to harbor communist sympathies

intelsat the international satellite 
organization has filed a lawsuit seeking 400 million from rocket 
builder martin marietta for a launch that left a 145 million 
satellite in a useless orbit 
the suit filed in us district court in baltimore accuses 
martin marietta of miswiring its titan 3 rocket and botching the 
march 14 launch for which intelsat paid 115 million 
martin marietta has said a wiring problem caused failure of the 
satellite and its attached booster rocket to separate from the 
titan 3 when they reached orbit as a result the satellite could 
not be sent on to its duty station 22300 miles above earth where 
communications satellites operate 
the satellite which intelsat had not insured will be a total 
loss unless it gets a boost a space shuttle crew will try to 
rescue the satellite next year costing intelsat another 90 
million or so 
martin marietta attempted a preemptive strike against intelsat 
in july asking the federal court to declare that its only legal 
only responsibility was to provide a replacement launch 
elliott miller martin mariettas director of corporate 
relations said intelsats suit had no merit and that intelsat had 
had an opportunity to buy insurance but declined 
under the launch services contract between martin marietta and 
intelsat the relationship of the parties for risk of loss is 
clearly set forth he said tuesday the contract provides that 
martin marietta is not liable for the satellite failure to achieve 
orbit 
the intelsat suit alleges martin marietta miswired the launch 
vehicle so that the payload did not and could not separate from 
the launch vehicle in response to commands sent by the martin 
marietta flight computer and computer software 
the titan 3 is designed to carry one or more payloads on its 
first mission in december 1989 it put two satellites into orbit 
electrical signals were routed to separate first one satellite and 
then the other 
the same wiring was in place for the intelsat launch which had 
no satellite in the no 1 position as a result the separation 
command never reached the satellite that was on board 
martin marietta has acknowledged that the launch failure was 
caused by this obvious and readily avoidable error the 
intelsat suit said adding that the rocket builder showed 
manifest reckless indifference to intelsats interests 
martin marietta launched a second satellite for intelsat in june 
without a problem 
in its suit martin marietta said it might have to go out of the 
commercial launch business if it were made to pay damages 
the very viability of martin mariettas commercial launch 
services business is dependent on a determination of its rights 
under the contract it said 
but in its countersuit intelsat noted that martin marietta was 
considering dropping out anyway having told its stockholders in an 
annual report that production of titan 3 rockets will depend upon 
the market for heavylift launch vehicles

when buses rolled up tuesday at schools 
throughout the city for the start of another academic year nearly 
400 students embarked on a new journey to private schools with 
taxpayers help 
the experimental milwaukee parental choice program eventually 
expected to help send 1000 poor milwaukee students to 
nonsectarian private schools survived two court challenges led by 
the states chief education official 
the debut drew raves from parents whose children qualified 
including single mother yvette harris who attended a private 
school as a child but could not afford the same for her three 
children 
for my 12yearold to go to a private school its really a 
privilege for us they were always praised for a quality education 
i couldnt afford the tuition at all said ms harris 
she enrolled her eldest jamal in seventh grade at juanita 
virgil academy and josh jr 4 and angelica 3 in preschool under 
the program which pays up to 2500 for each childs tuition 
the state vouchers completely covered the tuitions said ms 
harris who attended a parochial elementary school in chicago 
the programs funding is deducted from the operating budget of 
the milwaukee public schools system which has about 98200 
students 
families not more than 75 percent above the federal poverty 
level which allows a 12000 annual income for a family of four 
are eligible parents receive state vouchers that are redeemed by 
the schools 
the plans chief sponsor state rep polly williams greeted 
pupils at urban day elementary school where more than 100 new 
students enrolled with the help of the state the school has a 
total enrollment of 500 
ms williams a democrat said the program gives hope to poor 
students who suffered in crowded public schools that reinforce the 
cycle of poverty 
these kids are getting something out of these schools they 
cant get in the public school system every child who walks 
through those doors is expected to achieve its going to make a 
difference in the lives of a lot of children she said 
among the schools new students was antonio johnson an 
eighthgrader im going to try to do the best i can do he 
said 
the legislature authorized 25 million for the program enough 
for 1000 students but only 390 were registered in private 
schools by tuesday the eight participating private schools said 
they were forced to reject hundreds of students because of limited 
classroom space and teaching staff 
urban day administrator zakiya courtney said the school lost 
students in recent years because of rising tuition which now costs 
3300 a year 
private school has basically been afforded to those who can 
afford it if a lowincome parent couldnt make the sacrifice they 
couldnt do it we advocated for this program she said 
more than 300 students applied at the school under the program 
but most were denied entrance to retain average class sizes of 20 
students said courtney 
although the program was praised by gov tommy g thompson and 
the bush administration state schools superintendent herbert j 
grover opposed it saying it undermined public schools 
grover joined a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the 
program on the grounds that the private schools were private 
endeavors and therefore ineligible for state funds 
dane county circuit court and a state appeals court rejected the 
suit 
critics argue that the private schools are not accountable to 
the state 
the national association for advancement of colored people 
which also joined the lawsuit said the program helps only a few 
students while ignoring the thousands who will remain in public 
schools 
its crazy to talk about 1000 students when youve got 64000 
or better students in the milwaukee public schools who need help 
said felmers chaney president of the naacps milwaukee chapter 
proponents counter that the program may encourage public schools 
to improve 
plans that allow parents more choice on where to send their 
children to school have gained momentum in the last five years 
minnesota and iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to 
parents sending their children to private schools wisconsins 
voucher system is the nations first will likely be expanded in 
wisconsin and duplicated through the nation ms williams said 
public schools are shaking in their boots theyre terrified 
they dont know how theyre going to stop the movement she said

president mikhail s gorbachev under pressure 
from rival reformers like boris yeltsin personally will present a 
sweeping economic plan to the soviet parliament as early as monday 
a spokesman said tuesday 
gorbachev apparently has abandoned a moderate plan drafted by 
soviet prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov instead he will present 
a plan drafted in large part by stanislav shatalin a reformer who 
sits on gorbachevs presidential council said presidential 
spokesman vitaly n ignatenko 
shatalins ideas were embodied in a reform program presented to 
the parliament of the russian federation on monday 
ignatenko and other gorbachev aides say gorbachev and yeltsin 
the president of the russian federation largest of the 15 soviet 
republics agree on the general shape of the reforms 
a moderate plan presented last spring by ryzhkov was rejected by 
the national parliament after the proposal touched off a run of 
panic buying and he was drafting another moderate approach for 
presentation this fall 
the decision to bypass the premier this time does not mean 
that ryzhkov is no longer trusted by the president ignatenko 
said at a news conference 
the parliament of the russian federation was expected to approve 
yeltsins proposal next tuesday 
the soonest gorbachev could present his own plan to the national 
parliament would be at the opening session scheduled for monday 
the day after he was due back from a summit in helsinki with 
president bush 
ignatenko skirted the issue of whether gorbachev would in fact 
embrace the plan presented by yeltsin saying there is a general 
consensus now that the program approved by mikhail sergeyevich 
gorbachev should serve as the basis of future economic reform 
he said that each of the soviet republics would have a chance to 
consider the proposed reforms 
a single program will be submitted for them to approve based 
on what we call the professor shatalin plan ignatenko told a 
news conference 
but he did not specify whether he expected the russian 
federation which includes half the soviet people and twothirds 
its land mass to approve the shatalin plan before gorbachev has a 
chance to offer it for national consideration 
asked how gorbachev and yeltsin would reconcile their plans 
ignatenko said there were only three main areas of disagreement 
the rate or pace of reform the sequence of the reforms and the 
reform pricesetting machinery 
although those disagreements appear major ignatenko said 
there is no great difference between the two programs they are 
not antagonistic or irreconcilable 
he said the differences were very fine points that should be 
taken care of within the next few days our union republics will 
receive the program for discussion and approval every union 
republic is entitled to develop along its own lines and to amend 
those programs as they see fit 
copies of neither the yeltsin plan nor that under consideration 
by gorbachev were available to the western press members of the 
russian parliament said they had not yet seen a full copy of the 
250page report presented by yeltsin on monday 
however a version seen by the associated press said that it 
would relegate to the central government headed by gorbachev only 
those powers given to it by the 15 republics 
the kremlin would lose its power to levy taxes and would have to 
rely on dues from the republics but the central government would 
retain responsibility for defense strengthening the currency and 
disaster relief 
members of a visiting american delegation that met tuesday with 
a top gorbachev economic adviser nikolai petrakov said the 
central leadership also was leaning toward such a plan it would 
entail creation of a central bank similar to the us federal 
reserve to control the currency supply

next weekends ussoviet summit will give 
presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev a chance to prod 
slowmoving conventionalarms talks as well as forge an even 
stronger bond of opposition to iraqs saddam hussein 
administration officials said tuesday 
bush also is considering adding add a stop in europe to brief 
nat0 allies on his way back from sundays superpower summit in 
helsinki presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
administration officials said planners were focusing on a monday 
session in brussels 
originally bush planned to return directly to washington from 
the capital of finland but fitzwater said the president would like 
to be able to brief allied leaders on the summit if possible just 
as he did after his meeting last december with gorbachev at malta 
after that earlier summit bush stopped briefly in brussels to 
brief nato 
there is some discussion about whether we need to make another 
stop fitzwater said pack another pair of underwear he 
added in an aside to reporters who cover the president 
bush on his first day back from an ofteninterrupted threeweek 
vacation in maine met with his cabinet and other top advisers to 
discuss the upcoming summit 
a new foundation for world order is being built and the 
spadework begins in helsinki fitzwater declared it is 
somewhat ironic that the prospect of war is forging a new blueprint 
for world peace both leaders will want to apply some new 
brushstrokes to this emerging picture 
most public attention has focused on what the two leaders might 
say on the subject of iraqs invasion and continuing occupation of 
kuwait but arms talks also were sure to be discussed 
although negotiations on troop reductions are moving along well 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there still 
are serious problems in negotiating reductions on cuts in aircraft 
and artillery 
both countries hope to wind up the conventional forces in europe 
cfe pact in time for novembers planned 35country paris summit 
of all european nations plus the united states and canada 
the two presidents will not be negotiating details of this 
agreement fitzwater said but they will be attempting to add 
the impetus that will assure that that agreement is ready to sign 
and that the summit can be held 
the two leaders will also likely discuss progress on a treaty to 
reduce longrange nuclear weapons but officials said those talks 
appear to be moving along smoothly and less of a push is needed 
for them than for the conventional arms talks 
soviet economic reforms will also be on the agenda fitzwater 
and other officials said in particular bush is expected to bring 
up a study by the international monetary fund commissioned at 
last julys economic summit of industrial democracies in houston 
of soviet needs the officials said 
bush and gorbachev will also discuss regional hotspots 
including cambodia and afghanistan officials said 
still officials stressed that the main purpose of the summit 
was to provide a highly visible show of superpower solidarity in 
bringing pressure to bear on saddam to end his monthold occupation 
of kuwait 
this summit should provide an even stronger bond of unified 
opposition to saddam it also offers an important opportunity for 
both leaders to assess superpower interests in the postcold war 
period fitzwater said 
the administration announced on tuesday that bush will ask 
congress to forgive egypts 7 billion military debt to the united 
states and was looking at possible aid packages for other middle 
eastern nations that have helped out in enforcing the embargo 
in all 22 nations have contributed equipment or troops or both 
to the usled military effort to enforce the embargo 
bush will leave washington friday night meet with finlands 
president mauno koivisto on saturday and then devote most of sunday 
to his talks with gorbachev 
these include a morning session a luncheon an afternoon 
session and a joint news conference 
we envision that a good deal of time will be spent on the 
persian gulf in these meetings fitzwater said 
white house advance teams went to helsinki monday night to begin 
meetings with their soviet counterparts on logistics 
the white house had no immediate reaction to tuesdays proposal 
by the soviets for an international conference to discuss the 
persian gulf crisis the arabisraeli dispute and the lebanese 
civil war 
gorbachev seems likely to bring that proposal up at the weekend 
summit however 
as to soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadzes assertion

intelligence returned home tuesday more than 25 years after they 
were shot down in china 
yeh changti and chang liyi were greeted at the airport by 
their families and former colleagues its nice to be home 
again said yeh 
yeh and chang both in their early 60s have told reporters they 
wished to regain their status as majors in the air force to serve 
the country 
defense minister chen lian said tuesday the two mens military 
status could not be restored because of their age chen said 
however his ministry would provide necessary compensation for yeh 
and chang 
military officials said they welcomed the pilots return 
both yeh and chang were members of the black cat squadron a 
secret unit of taiwans air force formed in 1961 by selected combat 
pilots the now defunct squadrons missions were to fly usmade 
lockheed u2 reconnaissance aircraft over china to gather military 
information for the central intelligence agency and the nationalist 
government in taiwan 
the nationalists driven to taiwan in 1949 by communist forces 
in china had vowed to rule mainland china again the united states

eastern china and chang was downed in 1965 on a special research 
flight over northern china 
they were captured and sentenced to forced labor but were 
released from china in 1983 however their request to return home 
was rejected as taiwan authorities regarded the release as a 
chinese propaganda move 
the two then stayed in the united states with the help of the 
cia yeh is a resident of houston and chang lives in washington 
four nationalist pilots were killed during spy missions over 
china and six others died in accidents during training in the 
united states before authorities disbanded the squadron in 1974

austria said tuesday it was reimposing a 
visa requirement for poles and sending troops to the hungarian 
border to help stem an influx of east european refugees 
the interior ministry said polish citizens would once again need 
visas to travel to austria the visa requirement takes effect on 
friday and will be in force for six months 
the polish foreign ministry issued a brief statement expressing 
regret and surprise over austrias decision in retaliation 
the foreign ministry announced it was introducing a visa 
requirement for austrians for the same period 
austria has not required visas from poles since 1988 it was the 
only visafree travel destination in western europe for poles 
besides west berlin which will also change its regulations 
following the oct 3 german unification 
austria now finds itself facing a growing influx of east 
europeans over the past few months particularly poles and 
romanians who endure severe economic hardships at home 
austria says that with the exception of some romanians most of 
the new arrivals do not qualify for refugee status because they no 
longer face political persecution at home 
the main traiskirchen refugee camp south of vienna is currently 
accomodating 2000 people double its capacity the transfer of 
refugees to other facilities is slow 
in an effort to prevent romanians and other east europeans from 
illegally crossing the hungarianaustrian border austria said it 
would send 1500 soldiers in the next two days to the border region 
to assist customs officials 
chancellor franz vranitzky said the troops would be deployed for 
an initial period of 10 weeks 
interior minister franz loeschnak said monday the soldiers would 
be limited to patrolling the border and would only use their 
weapons in selfdefense 
the government said that if necessary soldiers may also be 
dispatched to patrol the borders with other eastern european 
countries austria is also bordered by czechoslovakia and 
yugoslavia 
in its statement the polish foreign ministry admitted some 
poles have engaged in illegal trade or work in austria but 
stressed that such phenomena cannot be a basis for making a 
decision limiting the freedom of travel of all citizens of both 
countries 
polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski also criticized 
the austrian decision 
it is discrepant with our policy aiming at introducing a full 
freedom of movement of people in europe skubiszewski said in an 
interview for an evening radio newscast 
austrian authorities had threatened to restore the visa 
requirement for poles earlier this year in an effort to meet 
austrian concerns poland imposed strict customs controls and 
invited austrian customs officials to join their counterparts at 
polish border crossings 
foreign ministry spokesman wladyslaw klaczynski noted that more 
and more western countries were lifting visa requirements for 
hungarians and czechoslovakians but he said no western country was 
currently planning to do the same for poles 
klaczynski said the austrian decision amounted to a kind of 
discrimination against poles 
we do not deny that it has its cause but this cause does not 
justify such a decision we should aim at removing barriers not at 
erecting them he told the associated press

defense secretary dick cheney confirmed 
tuesday that the united states has deployed combat aircraft in 
several smaller persian gulf states as part of the buildup of 
forces to protect saudi arabia 
he conceded that those aircraft deployments amount to a 
committment to defend the countries involved 
the announcement came as additional combatready forces 
continued to flow into the persian gulf region 
ships carrying a marine expeditionary unit from okinawa 
equipped with a squadron of assault and cargo helicopters have 
arrived in position near the saudi peninsula pentagon spokesman 
lt col stuart wagner said the 2200man unit left okinawa several 
weeks ago 
meanwhile pentagon sources said the persian gulf nation of 
bahrain had agreed to accept american fa18 jets which can 
either fight other warplanes or attack ground targets along with 
a6 bombers and av8 harrier jump jets those planes are flown by 
the navy and the marines 
also f16 airtoair fighters have been deployed in the united 
arab emirates and f15 ground attack jets in oman the sources 
said those planes are flown by the air force 
the united arab emirates had announced several weeks ago that it 
had agreed to accept us kc130 cargo and transport planes while 
qatar announced last week it would allow american f16 fighter jets 
that had been stationed in spain to be positioned on its territory 
cheney in an interview on abctvs good morning america 
declined to specify exactly which persian gulf nations had agreed 
to station us aircraft on their soil 
but he confirmed that attack planes and bombers had been 
positioned in nations along the southern shore of the persian gulf 
the location of bahrain qatar oman and the united arab emirates 
the exact degree of participation by each of them varies and 
there are obviously also some sensititivities on their part in 
terms of extent to which they are willing to acknowledge their 
cooperation cheney said but i think it would be fair to say 
that there is more cooperation from those persian gulf states today 
than there has ever been before in terms of our mutual security 
efforts in the region 
in another interview on cnn cheney said the bombers and war 
planes were not only deployed in saudi arabia but in some of the 
other nations in the region who are friends and allies of ours 
and who were cooperating in operation desert shield the deployment 
of forces to protect saudi arabia from iraq 
the secretary noted that most of those nations in the past have 
refused to accept any us military presence but now all are 
helping out 
some permit transport aircraft some permit combat aircraft and 
in some places we have access arrangements or naval arrangements 
they are cooperating to one degree or another he said 
cheney said he was able to negotiate the variety of agreements 
during his trip to the region last month 
asked whether the presence of us forces amounts to an implicit 
commitment to also defend those countries cheney said i think 
it does 
those countries warmed toward military cooperation with the 
united states during the eightyear war between iran and iraq when 
us warships protected kuwaiti tankers from iranian attack in the 
persian gulf 
the marine expeditionary unit is capable of conducting commando 
operations and contains a helicopter element including a variety of 
ah1 cobra gunships ch53 sea stallion assault choppers and ch46 
sea knight transport helicopters

saddam hussein warned he would regard foreigners 
hiding in kuwait as spies but iraqi censors cut the dire 
threat from his interview with the rev jesse jackson a producer 
said tuesday 
the deletion was the second case in four days of iraqi 
censorship of us television reports from baghdad despite the 
iraqi presidents recent attempts to use television to justify his 
aug 2 takeover of kuwait 
on monday iraqi censors blacked out part of an nbc report that 
showed foreign hostages nbc nightly news aired the report 
including the sudden blackout the censors imposed near the end of 
the piece as it was being transmitted via satellite from baghdad 
earlier iraqi censors cut eight to 10 minutes from jacksons 
interview friday with saddam according to av westin executive 
producer of inside edition a syndicated series that paid for 
jacksons trip to iraq last week 
the dire threat was that anybody who did not turn themselves 
in within 10 days would be treated as a spy westin said it 
was that they would be treated as spies and dealt with as spies 
that was eliminated from the tape 
but saddam made no threats of harm to them said kenneth walker 
a former abc news correspondent who accompanied jackson on his 
90minute interview with the iraqi president 
walker said the warning came in the context of jacksons 
questions about foreign women and children in kuwait 
he quoted jackson as telling saddam several times that these 
foreigners may not know of saddams previous offers to release them 
or were too terrified to surrender to iraqi forces 
after jackson urged saddam to jointly appear with him on baghdad 
tv to announce a specific plan for the release of foreign women and 
children walker said saddam finally said something like 
well i have good feelings for children but if these people do 
not come forward they will be regarded as spies 
walker said saddam did not make clear if he were speaking only 
of the women and children or of male foreigners but that it could 
be assumed he was referring to all three categories 
however in a tuesday broadcast of inside edition walker 
after checking with two american colleagues were with him during 
jacksons interview quoted saddam as saying of foreigners in 
kuwait 
any adults who dont come forward now will be treated as 
spies 
walker and westin said the censorship wasnt discovered until 
monday night when the staff of the syndicated inside edition 
was editing tapes of jacksons interview 
another missing portion westin said involved jacksons 
questions about providing fuel water and medicine for americans 
trapped at the us embassy in kuwait the embassy has defied 
saddams order to close 
walker said jacksons interview was taped by three tv crews from 
iraqs staterun television facilities the tapes that proved to be 
censored were given to jacksons entourage a day after the 
interview he said 
there had been no conditions set for the interview and was 
there no warning that censorship would occur he said 
jacksons meeting with saddam came three days after the iraqi 
leader was interviewed by cbs anchorman dan rather iraqi tv crews 
also taped that interview but cut nothing from it cbs spokeswoman 
donna dees said 
inside edition which paid 125000 for jackson and his 
14member entourage to go to iraq for the interview and other 
reports was to start a fourpart series on the trip tuesday 
jackson returned to washington from iraq on sunday with 47 freed 
americans who had been held hostage in iraq and kuwait 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater praised him tuesday 
saying president bush is pleased by jesses success in bringing 
back americans and were grateful he jackson was able to make 
those arrangements 
jacksons own the jesse jackson show is to premiere this 
month that show is syndicated by warner bros a rival of king

twentyfive americans were among nearly 300 
western women and children to arrive here tuesday from baghdad on 
three iraqi airways planes 
the last flight to arrive just before midnight 5 pm edt 
brought 150 people including the 25 americans 44 french 36 
british four australians and two canadian women and children they 
had been detained in iraq and kuwait since the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
one of the flights that arrived earlier in the day included 135 
west germans among its passengers and the other brought 170 
people mainly arab nationals 
a total of 175 western nationals were expected to leave amman 
early wednesday aboard a virgin atlantic airlines jumbo jet 
the jumbo had landed in amman a few hours earlier with 30 tons 
of food and other supplies for the tens of thousands of asian 
evacuees from kuwait stranded in squalid camps in jordan 
we heard there was a potentially catastrophic problem in 
jordan with young and old people dying and we had to do something 
before it was too late richard branson the british owner of the 
airline who flew in on the jet told reporters on arrival 
shortly after his arrival branson and his crew were thanked by 
jordans americanborn wife queen noor who went aboard the plane 
we are grateful we desperately need all this the queen 
told branson pointing at sacks of wheat slung on top of the 
scarlet firstclass seats aboard the plane 
we will get this to the really desperate areas and this kind 
of action that youve done is tremendous help she added 
branson said later he was upset because he made 200 seats 
available to one asian embassy to fly evacuees out of amman but a 
bureaucratic foulup meant the seats went unused 
he said he had provided the united nations with a list of 
airlines and planes available for charter for a massive airlift to 
fly home the estimated 100000 impoverished asian nationals 
stranded in jordan 
mothers emerged from the planes with sleeping infants and 
shouldering older children who looked confused 
i feel great said a young american george issa wearing a 
football jersey 
asked what he thought of baghdad american taleb subah said 
better than kuwait i tell you that 
kuwait was a living hell said the davenport iowa 
teenager you go to sleep on bombing and you wake up to it 
it is like vietnam i saw dead people all over they throw them in 
the trash 
an elderly american woman refused to say anything except i 
am so tired she kept walking past reporters 
most people were taken directly from the arriving airliners to 
the vip lounge at the queen alia airport where counselors and 
diplomats talked to them 
asked if she had been afraid sheila russell from northampton 
england said i never saw an angry man 
but when asked if she was happy to leave she answered i left 
my husband behind 
another british woman belinda quinn seemed overjoyed at her 
release she said i kept thinking every minute that the plane 
departure will be canceled 
one woman was asked what she would remember of it all 
just the gunfire and the explosions she said declining to 
give her name 
iraqi president saddam hussein said last week he would allow 
western women and children to leave but not the men more than 700 
western detainees women children and a few ailing men left 
aboard two iraqi airways flights on saturday some evacuees also 
have traveled across the desert to jordan 
but the departures of others have been complicated by iraqs 
refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in baghdad and by long 
delays in processing their exit permits about 11000 westerners 
are now believed stranded in kuwait and iraq 
earlier tuesday hundreds more westerners headed across the 
desert in buses hoping they too would be able to catch flights from 
baghdad to freedom 
the bus convoy carrying about 300 britons left occupied kuwait 
on tuesday and was headed for the iraqi capital 
the britishorganized bus convoy left kuwait at about 525 am 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd told reporters in saudi 
arabia

the 500mile trip traveling in a convoy of seven buses and a car 
he said in london a foreign office spokesman put the figure at 
150 women and 156 children 
william waldegrave the british foreign offices secondranking

two new studies of obesity and high blood 
pressure among children produced advice that sounds a lot like the 
admonitions of a strict parent watch what you eat and quit 
watching so much tv 
doctors studying a group of poor children in new york concluded 
that the childrens blood pressure depended in part on how much 
they weighed and exercised bad childhood habits could carry over 
to cause high blood pressure or heart disease when the children 
grow up the researchers warned 
there is evidence cardiovascular disease originates during 
childhood said the new york study which is published in 
wednesdays journal of the american medical association 
a second study a review of national data by the harvard school 
of public health and tufts new england medical center found that 
the more television obese children and adolescents watch the less 
likely they are to lose weight 
diet exercise and restriction of television viewing and other 
sedentary activities all appear necessary to halt the fattening of 
america said that report which was published in wednesdays 
edition of the journal of the american dietetic association 
the new york study was the first to examine the separate and 
combined effects of fitness and fatness in young innercity 
children said bernard gutin and his colleagues at columbia 
university 
over the last five years the researchers studied 216 children 
ages 5 and 6 recruited from clinics daycare centers and a 
hospital the children 91 percent of whom where hispanic came 
from poor families 
researchers took the childrens blood pressure tested their 
aerobic fitness on a treadmill and assessed their obesity by 
measuring their bodies and skin folds the report said it 
concluded that much of the difference in their blood pressures 
related to how fat and how fit they were 
while previous studies have shown that obesity and lack of 
fitness contribute to cardiovascular problems in adults it has 
never been shown before in children this young said gutin 
professor of applied physiology and education at columbia 
universitys teachers college 
we think of blood pressure as something we worry about as 
adults but it seems we have to worry about it when children are 
young he said in a telephone interview tuesday children are 
probably suffering damage to their coronary arteries even now 
the harvard study on television viewing grew from a second 
review of national data collected between 1963 and 1980 that data 
showed obesity increased by 46 percent among children and 
adolescents through the years though calorie intake hadnt risen 
proportionally said dietician lilian wy cheung 
she and other researchers went over the data again focusing on 
1900 children living throughout the united states said cheung 
director of the harvard nutrition and fitness project 
the chance of becoming fat increased 13 percent for each 
additional hour of television viewing daily the report said 
and the chances a youngster could be cured of obesity 
decreased 63 percent with each additional hour of television 
viewing daily the report said it defined cured as reducing weight 
to a desired level and keeping it off for five years 
previous studies have shown that watching television promotes 
obesity partly because it takes people away from more active 
pursuits also television commercials encourage people to eat 
highcalorie foods the study said

committee chairman les aspin dwis and the ranking 
republican rep bill dickinson rala said deploying reservists 
in combat roles would provide an important test of their 
capabilities and the wisdom of relying on reserve forces as part of 
future defense planning 
we want to see how good the combat units are aspin said 
at a news conference this is a test for the future 
president bushs callup of army reserves has been confined to 
support roles backing up activeduty combat forces in saudi arabia 
aspin and dickinson spoke separately a day after they returned 
from a fourday tour of the middle east as part of a 22member 
delegation 
pentagon spokesman pete williams questioned by reporters about 
the reserve issue declined to say what recommendations are before 
defense secretary dick cheney 
williams said there has been a lot of discussion about what 
might happen down the road but no decision has been made it is 
expected that it would take at least 90 days to train army combat 
reservists 
a member of a separate delegation of senators arriving at 
andrews air force base near washington from a saudi tour said late 
tuesday afternoon the question of the use of reserve combat units 
would be raised when lawmakers meet president bush on wednesday 
theres concern that were putting all this money into combat 
reserves and yet theyre not being called up said sen william 
cohen rmaine a member of the armed services committee 
aspin said defense planning for the postcold war period has 
been based in part on an assumption that reserve units could be 
used in any medium to largescale troop deployment however he 
said military officials are reluctant to use reserves in combat 
roles 
he said military leaders including those in saudi arabia are 
skeptical about the use of reserve combat forces citing three or 
sixmonth limitations as one reason but aspin said that military 
estimates that combat reservists would require up to 60 days 
training may be too pessimistic 
the reserve callup has been for only a threemonth period but 
aspin and dickinson said congress may need give bush broader 
authority to call up reservists and national guardsmen for up to a 
years service 
lawmakers returning from their trip to bahrain egypt and saudi 
arabia and an inspection of us military operations expressed 
widespread support for bushs response to iraqs invasion of 
kuwait some said the crisis will prompt a new look at how us 
military dollars are spent as the nation comes to grips with 
growing budget problems 
the overriding concern among lawmakers was the level of 
participation by other nations in operation desert shield and the 
campaign to deter iraqi aggression 
i call on our nato countries to take a more active role with 
men on the ground house republican leader bob michel of illinois 
told reporters 
the lawmakers comments came as congressional and white house 
negotiators prepared for a fourday closed session on reaching a 
deficitcutting agreement to solve the budget crisis the session 
begins friday 
in addition the full house is scheduled to take up a 283 
billion defense bill for fiscal 1991 starting monday with planned 
cuts in the strategic defense initiative and the b2 stealth bomber 
on the agenda 
throwing a wrench in plans to cut bushs request for 307 
billion in defense spending for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 is 
the white house estimate that it will cost 1 billion a month to 
foot the bill for operation desert shield 
lawmakers said the us presence would likely last at least two 
or three months and rep sonny montgomery dmiss told reporters 
that even if we get hussein to settle down we might have to 
keep some multinational force over there 
asked how the united states could pay for us forces 
montgomery a member of the house armed services committee 
suggested reducing the planned purchase of some weapons while 
eliminating others 
in its version of the defense bill the house armed services 
committee halted production of the b2 bomber at the 15 currently 
in production at nearly 865 million each it is the costliest 
airplane ever built 
the panel also stripped nearly 2 billion from bushs request of 
47 billion for sdi popularly known as star wars 
in a report on the trip house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo said additional money must be provided in this fiscal year 
as well as the next to support the us military presence in the 
persian gulf

american indian leaders urged congress on 
tuesday to approve a memorial to the warriors who fell at little 
big horn while virginia officials urged a national commission to 
help preserve civil war battlefields 
we need to honor our warriors who gave their lives carol 
gipp of the national congress of american indians told the house 
interior committees subcommittee on national parks and public 
lands 
the appeal came as indians conservationists and others crowded 
the hearing room to plead for approval of favorite bills before 
congress adjourns next month 
a memorial to the warriors who fell in the 1876 victory of the 
sioux over lt col george custer and a detachment of the 7th 
cavalry regiment would cost about 21 million the national park 
service has estimated the service is supporting the memorial as 
yet undesigned 
the memorial would be adjacent to the monument to the 7th 
cavalry which was erected on last stand hill on the montana 
battlefield in 1881 it bears the full names of custer and each of 
the 224 other men in his command 
custer was a temporary general with the union army during the 
civil war but reverted to lieutenant colonel afterward the rank he 
held in 1876 
susan shownharjo president of the morning star foundation 
representing the cheyenne and arapaho tribes said the names of the 
cavalry troopers on the monument has given them dignity in 
death 
our people who died there are referred to as hordes of indians 
along with the cavalry who are named she said 
the number of indian dead is unknown but the national park 
service says no more than 100 are believed to have been killed in 
the battle 
virginia officials and historic preservationists urged approval 
of a national commission on civil war battlefields to help shield a 
number of sites from development as the suburbs outside the 
nations capital spread southward 
mayor elizabeth g helm of winchester pointed to estimates that 
employment in the dulles corridor outside washington would grow 
more than 1000 percent and the homes of those joining the labor 
force most likely would be in central maryland and the northern 
shenandoah valley 
this same area is heavily steeped in history and tradition but 
we have tended to take this heritage for granted she said we 
have assumed that it will always be with us for future 
generations 
our ancestors provided beautifully for large and splendid 
confederate and national cemeteries but no one anticipated the 
growth that has obliterated many of the battlefields she added 
also urging action were reps jim olin dva and d french 
slaughter jr rva as well as historic preservationists who are 
urging quick action by the government before suburban sprawl 
gobbles up battlefields 
dr james gardner deputy director of the american historical 
association however opposed the plan if approved he said 
greater and greater amounts of money will be pushed into this 
aspect of our history to the exclusion of others 
he said preservationists should not be so preoccupied with 
civil war battlefields 
we need to pull back from this civil war focus and take a 
broader view of american history he said

a new wave of americans has begun returning home after fleeing 
kuwait and as with previous hostages their joy is tempered by the 
knowledge that others remain behind 
it feels great rhonda kilgore said monday after she and her 
three young children arrived at her mothers home in raytown mo 
a suburb of kansas city 
yet ms kilgore who asked to be identified by her maiden name 
only said she worries about her husband who had to stay behind 
ms kilgore five months pregnant and suffering from anemia was 
among 46 americans with medical problems who were allowed to fly 
back to the united states with the rev jesse jackson on sunday 
we have to thank jesse jackson for all of it she said if 
it wasnt for him negotiating with saddam hussein i dont think 
any of us would have gotten out of there 
she said she hopes her husband who is jordanian will be able 
to escape through jordan and join the family in the united states 
sandi abdilkareem is another american who married a jordanian 
and while she and her four children arrived to a joyous greeting by 
relatives in seattle on monday night her husband david 
abdilkareem remains in the middle east 
the abdilkareems drove 500 miles across iraq to escape kuwait 
mrs abdilkareem said she said her husband chose to stay behind 
he wanted to stay said mrs abdilkareem who moved to 
kuwait about 12 years ago with her husband everything we worked 
for is back there if everything calms down i hope one day to go 
back 
mrs abdilkareem whose father gary marquardt lives in gig 
harbor wash said she decided to return to the us five days 
ago when hussein promised that american women and children would 
be allowed to leave 
we said wed better take the chance before something else 
happens the next morning we were ready to go she said 
the family drove from their home in ahmidie kuwait to baghdad 
although they were stopped and checked several times by iraqi 
officials they were allowed to go on to baghdad where they stayed 
four days before boarding a plane mrs abdilkareem said 
me and my husband drove with no problem she said 
mrs abdilkareem credited jackson with getting her plane off the 
ground on sunday the flight was canceled at the last minute but 
she said jackson persuaded iraqi authorities to allow it to leave 
ms kilgore was able to leave directly from kuwait although she 
said there were some tense moments before her departure 
it was last friday she said when word came from the us 
embassy to get to the airport in 10 minutes on the way there a 
soldier stopped the car and asked where they were going her 
husband said they were bound for the airport and when the soldier 
asked his wifes nationality he replied she was american 
he just kind of hesitated like he didnt know what to do 
ms kilgore said three seconds just seemed like a lifetime 
waiting for his decision 
the soldier waved them on but the ordeal was far from over 
there were no american embassy officials at the airport and when 
one of the other americans called to check they found out that 
jackson was still negotiating with saddam hussein for the release 
they were told to be patient but it meant a wait of more than 
eight hours 
the airport was full of iraqis she said i was scared to 
death we thought maybe if the negotiation doesnt go through all 
of these iraqis have us

not one step back chanted about 200 people in front of the 
national television system master controls building when they heard 
the government offer 
the slogan a standby of the leftist sandinistas pointed up the 
tension between the conservative government of president violeta 
barrios de chamorro and the sandinistas the confrontation raised 
the possibility of a public sector strike similar to those that 
crippled the nation in may and july 
about 70 people survivors and war wounded including those in 
wheelchairs invaded the tv station monday evening broadcast a 
short message before the transmission signal was cut off and 
locked themselves inside the building

erode pay increases 
i told them it was a mockery to us lopez said they said 
they would get back to us and nothing happened thats why we took 
this over

accused in a bribery sting pleaded guilty tuesday and agreed to 
cooperate with federal prosecutors 
robert brown 34 a democrat and former chairman of the house 
labor commerce and industry committee admitted accepting 2500 
in bribes from a lobbyist working for the fbi in exchange for 
supporting a bill to allow parimutuel betting on dog and horse 
racing in the state if approved the bill would have put the 
gambling issue on the november ballot 
the 7year lawmaker resigned his seat aug 23 the day before he 
was indicted under the federal hobbs act which forbids lawmakers 
from accepting money or gifts in exchange for votes or favors 
brown pleaded guilty to one corruption count in us district 
court before judge falcon b hawkins 
after his hearing prosecutors released a grainy blackandwhite 
videotape showing the fbi sting operation that led to the 
indictments of brown and four other state lawmakers

2000 from ron cobb a lobbyist who was recruited by the fbi the 
money was exchanged on a yacht at hilton head island 
fbi special agent michael clemens testified that brown later 
accepted 500 from cobb here 
clemons testified that cobb first approached brown in january 
the agent quoted brown as saying he wanted money in exchange for 
his support telling cobb i think you know where my motivation 
is 
when cobb asked brown to name an amount brown said he wanted 
the biggest number you can get clemens testified 
in late july shortly after news of the investigation broke 
brown filed an amended campaign report disclosing that he had 
received 2500 cash from cobb he denied then that the money was a 
bribe 
us attorney bart daniel said he would recommend a sentence of 
about 3 years in exchange for browns cooperation which is to 
include testimony against his colleagues if necessary the maximun 
penalty is 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
a sentencing date has yet to be set 
brown who is free on bond declined to comment after the 
hearing 
rick lee a republican who resigned his senate seat last week 
is scheduled to appear before a federal judge on monday lee has 
said he intends to plead guilty to accepting a 2000 bribe from 
cobb 
state reps robert kohn luther taylor and danny winstead all 
face similar charges winstead also was charged with obstruction of 
justice 
kohn a republican who has said he wont seek reelection and 
taylor a democrat were suspended from the house pending 
resolution of the charges winstead a republican resigned his 
seat last month 
the indictments capped a 16month fbi investigation in alleged 
corruption in the state legislature 
the gambling bill was approved by browns committee last year 
but never came up for a full house vote the full senate also 
failed to vote on a similar bill

iraq raised hopes tuesday for speeding up 
the evacuation of stranded western women and children by allowing 
two charter flights to leave baghdad and a bus convoy to take 
britons out of kuwait 
two iraqi airways boeing 727s chartered by west germany and the 
united states flew nearly 300 foreigners mostly women and 
children to amman jordan on tuesday 
western diplomats said a third jetliner chartered by france 
would leave baghdad for the jordanian capital on wednesday 
the canadian charge daffaires dale carl said canada had 
chartered an iraqi airways boeing 707 to fly 175 westerners all 
but 30 of them canadians from kuwait city to baghdad and then on 
thursday to ankara turkey he said iraq had promised to issue exit 
visas at the baghdad airport 
the united states hoped to arrange its own charter to carry 
americans out of kuwait within days 
iraq president saddam hussein said last week he would allow 
western women and children to leave but not the men more than 700 
western detainees women children and a few ill men left aboard 
two iraqi airways flights on saturday some also have traveled 
across the desert to jordan 
but the departures of others have been complicated by iraqs 
refusal to allow foreign airlines to land in baghdad and by long 
delays in processing exit permits about 11000 westerners are now 
believed stranded in kuwait and iraq 
the american charter on tuesday carried at least 138 passengers 
including 25 americans 44 french and 36 british nationals as well 
as four australians and two canadians 
its departure from baghdad was delayed for 4 hours because of 
technical problems with the aircraft iraqi authorities said a 
second plane had to be substituted 
i have to assume there were technical problems and assume 
there was no ill will said one western diplomat 
the west german charter included 135 west german nationals among 
its passengers 
also tuesday a convoy carrying 306 british women and children 
in seven buses and one car left kuwait in the morning to make the 
grueling drive across the desert to baghdad a british diplomat 
said 
we are pretty sure that theyre on their way out said the 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity when they arrive we 
will start processing their exit visas their travel documents 
british diplomats said they hoped to arrange a charter flight 
direct to london or failing that to amman for the britons in the 
convoy 
we just want to get them out said the diplomat if there 
is no charter then we will send them out in batches on regularly 
scheduled commercial flights to amman as a last resort we will 
move them out by convoy to jordan 
the bbc world service began carrying announcements late monday 
advising british women and children about the bus convoy the 
embassy also used a system of volunteer wardens to get the word out 
to britons in hiding 
the women and children were told to gather at a shopping center 
parking lot and to bring plenty of water along for the 400mile 
drive up the tigris river basin to baghdad 
western diplomats in baghdad described the situation in occupied 
kuwait as grim since the aug 2 iraqi invasion and have been 
pushing to speed the evacuation of women and children 
they are not sure how much longer their countries diplomats in 
kuwait can hold on to assist people in leaving diplomats who have 
rejected iraqi demands to move to baghdad are stranded in their 
embassies with the power and water cut off and food supplies 
diminishing 
a norwegian diplomat in iraq said the norwegian foreign ministry 
has instructed ambassador hans wilhelm longva and the two remaining 
staff members to leave the embassy in kuwait city on thursday and 
travel to baghdad 
on monday western diplomats said iraq had complicated 
evacuation plans by rescinding landing rights in baghdad for 
foreign jetliners the iraqis linked their decision to the denial 
of landing rights abroad to iraqi planes under the un trade 
embargo baghdad said evacuees must be flown out on chartered iraqi 
airways planes 
the canadian charter would be the first full flight of evacuees 
from kuwait city to baghdad on saturday the rev jesse jackson 
arranged to fly about 30 americans out of kuwait to connect with a 
special evacuation flight in baghdad 
more than 2000 americans including an estimated 1400 women 
and children are unaccounted for in kuwait and thought to be in 
hiding 
iraq has said that western men cannot leave as long as a threat 
is posed by the massive usled military buildup across the border 
in saudi arabia 
naji alhadithi directorgeneral of the iraqi information 
ministry said thousands of foreign guests have been relocated 
at potential military targets to make the americans think twice 
about attacking 
iraq has warned it will hang any kuwaitis caught harboring 
westerners 
but a diplomatic source said tuesday that the kuwaiti resistance 
has countered the iraqi threat by warning it will kill anyone who 
turns in people harboring westerners

jean shoults was careful to pick a 
stable neighborhood with solid home values when she moved her 
family here two years ago but a single government decision may 
cost her 25000 in home equity 
you think youre buying the american dream and it turns into a 
nightmare mrs shoults said we are savings and loan victims 
shes not alone across the country more and more people are 
finding they too are sampl victims small businesses cant find 
loans subcontractors get stiffed on payments real estate markets 
are in ruins neighborhoods tied up in government red tape home 
buyers like judy and dave crenshaw in colorado springs colo 
battle through three mortgage companies and lose out on one home 
before finally getting a deal approved 
you wouldnt expect a small phoenix gold and jewelry store to be 
affected by the sampl debacle or a small advertising agency to end 
up a victim 
but the sampl mess has forced its way onto main street it has 
eliminated jobs crushed real estate values and weakened an already 
weak economy by crimping lending 
all this before the tax bite estimated at about 20 per family 
each month over the next 30 years 
its catching up to us quickly said david wyss chief 
financial economist at drimcgraw hill people are beginning to 
see more and more that were all victims 
for years the crisis had little impact for millions of 
americans because federal deposit insurance protected their 
accounts at savings banks shielding main street from the 500 
billion fiasco 
now however changes made by congress and regulators along 
with the restructuring of the industry are affecting the economy 
contributing to the nations credit crunch and possibly helping 
push a sluggish us economy closer to recession economists say 
the construction industry which is struggling nationwide is 
particularly hardhit by problems associated with sampls which 
traditionally have been the chief source of financing for home 
building 
demand is down but changes ordered by regulators also have 
helped curb building loans and analysts say banks and sampls are 
reluctant to make any real estate loan that might be labeled risky 
by regulators 
builders live on credit said dean crist research economist 
for the national association of home builders so what this has 
done is cut them off completely 
that sets off a chain reaction that ends on main street 
home buyers say theyve had a tough time finding financing and 
sellers have been battered by the lack of buyers the huge amount 
of empty real estate has depressed prices 
spring valley construction found itself an inadvertent victim of 
the sampl mess the company built much of stonebridge ranch a giant 
samplfinanced development north of dallas when the sampl went bust 
spring valley still was owed several hundred thousand dollars for 
work it already had done 
we dont get paid so our subcontractors dont get paid it 
ends up with the guy that works for a living jim duffy 
stonebridges vice president of operations 
the sampl crisis is impacting main street in many other ways

joan leff gets teary thinking about her future she too is a 
victim but shes more a victim of the risktaking of highflying 
sampl executives unleashed by the deregulation of the industry 
ms leff an office manager at a california retirement home 
took all the money she had 90000 from a divorce settlement to 
a local savings bank lincoln savings amp loan to buy a certificate 
of deposit that would give her monthly interest to help pay her 
rent 
instead a salesman talked her into a bond that paid slightly 
higher interest ms leff thought the bond was safe and insured 
just like a cd 
it wasnt 
the bond turned out to be a junk bond in lincolns parent 
company american continental corp american continental defaulted 
on the bonds which have been basically worthless since april 1989 
some 22000 investors most in california bought 250 million 
worth of them investors in illinois and other states have similar 
complaints about other sampls 
unable to pay her rent ms leff moved into a cheap onebedroom 
apartment where she still lives 
the loss was almost worse than the loss of my marriage she 
said 
bondholders and the state of california have sued american 
continental and its former chairman charles keating claiming 
fraud in the bond sales american continental and keating have 
denied any wrongdoing 
but ms leff finds little comfort in any lawsuit 
its not like i invested in penny stocks or pork bellies or 
even the stock market said ms leff the office manager at a 
retirement home 
i thought a bank would be safe

gary homsey didnt get in a financial bind because of sampl 
borrowing or even sampl accounts he runs his own advertising agency 
in dallas that specializes in financial institutions and the sampl

michael kay seemed even farther removed from the thrift debacle 
he sells jewelry at a strip shopping center in north phoenix and 
until recently business was good 
but kay had to pack up the gold and jewelry store and move it a 
mile down the street which cost his business 50000 
his shopping center fell into the hands of government regulators 
and lost most of its tenants no tenants no traffic 
other phoenix stores in the chain were growing but kay saw 
business decline 
the trickledown process is severe in the sampl crisis said 
kay who had been at the bell tower village four years these 
kind of centers are just neglected 
bell tower village is slated to be auctioned off by the 
government this fall

jean shoults the arlington texas woman in danger of taking a 
25000 hit on her home equity believes her neighborhood is 
beginning to feel the crisis in an even newer way fallout from 
government decisions 
the fashionable wooded area parker oaks has gone to court 
trying to block the resolution trust corp the government agency 
charged with disposing of sampl properties from selling the 
remaining 108 lots to a tracthome developer 
the builder centex corp has proposed building fox amp jacobs 
brand homes for 48 to 60 a square foot parker oaks residents 
say most of the homes in the neighborhood are worth at least 70 a 
square foot even at todays depressed prices and deed 
restrictions on the land were designed to ensure continuity 
throughout the neighborhood 
putting cheaper tract homes next to larger custom homes would 
depress the value of the larger homes as well as violate deed 
restrictions the parker oaks homeowners thought protected them 
residents contend 
the neighborhood has asked a federal court to block the sale 
rtc officials declined comment because of the pending court case 
but fox amp jacobs president richard sconyers said his companys plan 
meets the deed restrictions and is fully compatible with whats 
out there 
residents disagree and theyve added a new decorative accent to 
their welltodo neighborhood huge protest signs and banners 
attacking the rtc 
it ruins us as far as housing value goes said mrs shoults 
the biggest investment you make is in a house this represents 
just about everything weve got

lt gov martha griffiths who was dumped 
from the election ticket amid hints that at 78 she was too old for 
a third term said tuesday she supports the governor anyway 
yes ill vote for the governor i support the governor i 
support the democratic party griffiths said promising she wont 
fight gov james blanchard at next weeks state democratic 
convention 
the governor has spoken and i will object to a floor fight 
she said blanchard dropped the lieutenant governor as his running 
mate aug 24 saying the no 2 slot should be filled by someone who 
could take over the heavy responsibilities of being governor 
he refused to elaborate and has yet to name a replacement 
griffiths who originally was furious said tuesday that she and 
blanchard have kissed and made up but her husband hicks 
griffiths said he might support the republican candidate 
that delighted supporters of republican candidate john engler 
who last week chose a 66yearold former mother of the year and 
state senator as his running mate 
the gop candidated for lieutenant governor is sen connie 
binsfeld who has been in politics since 1975 she was honored by 
the michigan mothers association in 1977 as mother of the year 
engler insisted his decision had nothing to do with the 
blanchardgriffiths furor but in announcing her selection he 
stressed that binsfeld is qualified to take over as governor if 
something should happen to him 
griffiths on tuesday raised the issue of sex and discrimination 
noting that nobody objected to the reelection campaign of her 
fellow democrat secretary of state richard austin age 77 
the lieutenant governor briefly described a meeting she had with 
blanchard last week to explain a published report of her apparent 
reference to him as a son of a bitch 
she said she told the governor she meant the reference to 
politicians in general rather than to him specifically however 
she dodged a question about whether blanchard falls into the same 
category as those other politicians 
you be the judge she responded

the federal payola case against record 
promoter joseph isgro was thrown out of court tuesday by a judge 
who accused proscutors of outrageous government misconduct in 
withholding testimony 
us district judge james ideman said prosecutors deliberately 
withheld from the defense contradictory statements by a key witness 
against isgro 
the independent promoter was hired by record companies to 
persuade radio stations to play their songs prosecutors allege 
that isgro gave payola of cash and cocaine to employees of stations 
in texas and california in return for playing certain songs 
the decision also threw out the case against isgros two 
codefendants convicted cocaine dealer jeffrey monka and former 
columbia records executive raymond anderson 
isgro was being tried on 57 counts of racketeering failing to 
report the payments to the internal revenue service and other 
charges 
his trial had been called the radio and record industrys 
biggest payola case in 30 years it featured testimony about 
cocaine and cash stuffed into album jackets and audio cassette 
cases delivered to radio station executives 
under a 1960 federal law failing to disclose paying or 
receiving payola on income tax returns is illegal but the 
actual payment is not a violation 
the key witness whose statements were at issue in the dismissal 
motion was dennis di ricco a former internal revenue service agent 
convicted of tax conspiracy and obstruction of justice in san 
francisco in 1989 
isgros lawyers discovered last week that di ricco testified in 
his own behalf in that trial they got a transcript of the 
testimony and found that it contradicted what he told a grand jury 
that indicted isgro 
in the san francisco case di ricco denied any involvement in 
payola activities with isgro in his testimony against isgro before 
a los angeles grand jury di ricco claimed involvement 
ideman declared a mistrial and ordered the indictment dismissed 
the court finds there has been outrageous government 
misconduct in this case the judge said 
friends of isgro cheered and congratulated him in the courtroom 
he had few words outside court he said he was relieved and 
happy 
everything the judge said was absolutely true said defense 
attorney don re the government was willing to win at all costs 
and it got its hand caught in the cookie jar 
assistant us attorney william lynch said its regrettable 
the judge made that decision we believe he is wrong and we will 
appeal 
ideman ruled last week that justice department prosecutors 
improperly withheld from the defense di riccos prior testimony 
ideman said then that prosecutors violated a longestablished 
rule requiring disclosure before trial of any witness statements 
that would tend to help a defendant prove his innocence 
prosecutors admitted in a written brief that they didnt give 
the defense a transcript of di riccos prior testimony but they 
denied that they intended to hide anything 
di ricco wasnt sent to prison on his conviction because he 
agreed to cooperate at isgros trial

nasa enjoyed a calm uneventful 
countdown tuesday as the space agency moved closer to its third 
attempt to send columbia on an astronomy mission and its first 
shuttle flight in months 
columbia is scheduled to lift off at 120 am thursday with 
seven astronauts and the 150 million astro observatory 
everybodys very comfortable the firing room is very calm 
said test director al sofge were just proceeding down through 
the count business as usual doing what we do best no problems 
nasas first attempt to launch columbia with astro ended six 
hours before the scheduled may 30 liftoff when hydrogen leaked 
during fueling the next countdown was halted thursday after 
engineers lost contact with one of four telescopes inside 
columbias cargo bay 
the communications problem with the xray telescope was 
corrected sunday allowing nasa to begin counting down once again 
weve had our share of problems i figure its time to have 
something go right for astro said project manager bill 
huddleston 
the latest delay required a slight juggling of astros observing 
schedule said arthur davidsen principal investigator of johns 
hopkins universitys ultraviolet telescope 
astronomers now will be able to observe jupiter which was too 
close to the sun as of last week davidsen said but an important 
quasar the brightest one in fact has moved too close to the 
sun and will not be visible to astro until late fall 
we dont want to delay that long davidsen said 
scientists have been waiting for years for nasa to send up the 
observatory which will study ultraviolet light and xrays emitted 
from some of the hottest objects in the universe about 150 objects 
will be observed during the nine to 10day flight including a 
comet that is making its first recorded pass through the solar 
system 
astro had been scheduled for a ride on columbia in march 1986 
but the challenger disaster two months earlier put all missions on 
hold 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes will be operated 
roundtheclock by the four astronomers aboard columbia the xray 
telescope will be managed by computer commands sent from goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md 
it will be the first scientific mission in five years dedicated 
entirely to scientific research astro will remain in the cargo bay 
and be returned to earth for possible use on a future mission 
columbia will be the first shuttle to fly since the entire fleet 
was grounded by hydrogen leaks this summer 
a month after columbias leaks were discovered atlantis was 
found to have a similar problem and its july flight delayed nasa 
has since replaced columbias hydrogen lines and rescheduled 
atlantis secret military mission for november 
were looking for a success huddleston said we have all 
expectations that were going to have a success 
nasa last launched a shuttle in april discoverys crew 
successfully placed the hubble space telescope in orbit but the 
15 billion telescope later was found to have a defective mirror 
that produces blurry images 
nasa is wasting no time getting its shuttle program back on 
track the space agency began moving discovery out to the other 
shuttle launch pad tuesday night to await an october flight with 
the ulysses satellite the fourmile trip was expected to take 
about six hours ending early wednesday 
it will be only the third time both pads at kennedy space center 
have been occupied the last time was in april when columbia was 
rolled out for the astro mission and discovery was waiting to lift 
off with hubble the other time was just before the challenger 
accident 
nasa must launch discovery between oct 5 and oct 23 to take 
advantage of earths alignment with the sun and jupiter otherwise 
the mission will have to wait 13 months ulysses is being sent on a 
fiveyear journey to explore the suns poles

a navy submarine will investigate and possibly 
retrieve what searchers believe is debris from a united airlines 
jet on the ocean floor near here the military said tuesday 
nine people died when a cargo door and a large chunk of fuselage 
tore away from the boeing 747 shortly after takeoff from honolulu 
international airport last year 
in july an unmanned submersible using sonar located metallic 
objects 14000 down and 90 miles south of honolulu including a 
large piece roughly the size of the 10by10foot cargo door 
after reviewing information on the debris field the national 
transportation safety board decided to call for further 
investigation said lt cmdr sandy stairs a spokeswoman for 
pacific command which is responsible for all us forces in the 
area 
the ntsb has said recovering and analyzing the door could lead 
to better airline safety rules 
the search is expected to begin sept 15 
the submarine named the sea cliff is a 31foot 58000pound 
craft able to operate at depths up to 20000 feet it carries a 
threemember crew 
the submarine and its support ship are capable of retrieving 
objects from the ocean floor stairs said 
stairs said searchers will take pictures of the debris and let 
authorities decide whether it is worth retrieving 
the sea cliff left san diego on tuesday and is expected to 
arrive at pearl harbor on sept 11 stairs said 
united flight 811 carried 355 passengers when it left honolulu 
for new zealand on feb 24 1989 
the cargo door opened at 22000 feet tearing away a section of 
fuselage nine people were swept to their deaths and five other 
suffered serious injuries the crew managed to return the jet to 
honolulu 
the ntsb inquiry determined that faulty design of the locking 
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the 
door was locked 
the agency blamed united boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to correct problems with the door

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday the bush administration is giving preliminary thought to 
creating a natotype organization to deal with future security 
threats to the persian gulf 
at the same time baker said iraq has been restored to the list 
of countries which the united states accuses of engaging in 
international terrorism 
testifying before the house foreign affairs committee baker was 
asked by rep stephen solarz dny about ways the united states 
might confront future security challenges in the persian gulf 
solarz expressed particular concern about the presence of chemical 
and biological weapons in the iraqi arsenal 
i think we will have to give consideration to working with 
others to create a new security structure for the region baker 
said i think thats likely to be required even if there is a 
pullback by iraq from kuwait 
it is conceivably possible to come up with a security 
structure that would make it so clearly to the detriment of any 
subsequent leader or even the present leader to use or 
contemplate using chemical or biological weapons that there would 
be very little risk that they would be used 
such a structure would be aimed at constraining aggressors 
such as iraq baker said he recalled that nato was able to deal 
with soviet expansionist ambitions during the cold war 
in such a structure certainly we ought to play some role and 
therefore there would be some presence some continuing presence 
there baker said 
maybe it wouldnt be a ground force presence he continued 
maybe it would be a naval presence i mean these are questions 
that are going to have to be addressed down the line and theyre 
questions that are going to have to be studied considerably 
for about 40 years the united states has maintained warships in 
the persian gulf sometimes only a small number and a fleet in the 
mediterranean sea 
we would not like to have to repeat the us buildup baker 
said a buildup he estimated would cost 6 billion by the end of 
the year 
baker told the committee that iraq was restored to the terrorism 
list after iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said that iraq was 
free from any moral obligation to proscribe acts of terrorism 
against american british or french interests 
iraq had been on the state department list of countries that 
engage in statesupported terrorism but was removed from that list 
as part of a general accommodation between the two countries during 
the early 1980s 
the other countries on the list are syria libya cuba north 
korea and iran 
restoring iraq to the list was largely a symbolic measure 
membership on the list means the country in question is not 
entitled to certain economic benefits including agricultural 
credits 
in iraqs case there are no benefits to be suspended because of 
the embargo the united states imposed on iraq after its takeover of 
kuwait 
a us official explaining the move said we are deeply 
cvoncerned over growing ties between iraq and international 
terrorists particularly disturbing is the movement of terrorist 
groups and their leaders to baghdad and calls issued through the 
iraqi news agency for attacks on american interests 
specifically the official who requested anonymity said abu 
nidal and abul abbas leaders of palestinian factions operate from 
baghdad 
abu nidal is suspected in the bombings of rome and vienna 
airports in december 1986 abul abbas reportedly was involved in 
the attempted assault may 30 on tel aviv beaches the abortive 
attack prompted the bush administration to suspend its talks with 
the palestine liberation organization 
abul abbas also is connected by the state department office to 
counter terrorism with the hijacking of the italian cruise ship 
achille lauro in 1985 
baker said he believes that iraqi president saddam hussein may 
be willing to pursue a negotiated settlement once the global 
economic embargo has greater impact he added however that saddam 
is showing no such disposition at present 
we would like to see this matter resolved by peaceful means 
baker said we do not believe in our heart of hearts that saddam 
hussein is prepared to move forward on the diplomatic track 
baker was accorded a generally friendly reception by house 
members during his first appearance on capitol hill since the gulf 
crisis erupted five weeks ago virtually all committee members 
praised baker and the administration for the way in which they have 
managed the crisis 
baker reaffirmed that the united states continues to seek a 
complete withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait and the restoration 
to power of the deposed kuwaiti leadership 
he said the united states should not be willing to compromise on 
those demands 
we cant have negotiations on what the future government of 
kuwait should or could be he said he did not rule out however 
the possibility that territorial or other disputes could be 
negotiated once there is a complete full and unconditional 
withdrawal from kuwait

south korea asked north korean 
delegates wednesday to agree to a proposal on easing tensions 
between the two enemies that includes recognizing the others 
sovereignty free travel and gradual arms reduction 
the souths eightpoint proposal was based on its conviction 
that lesser agreements must precede talks on unification of the 
peninsula divided in 1945 north korea believes the two koreas can 
only establish trust if they agree to the major issues of arms cuts 
and reunification 
the souths proposal came at the opening session of the 
firstever premiers talks between north and south korea the 
highest level conference between the two rivals in 45 years 
should the authorities of both sides persist in 
confrontational and hostile attitudes interkorean relations will 
never be improved said south korean prime minister kang 
yoonhoon 
kang speaking first at the meeting also proposed the two 
governments work jointly to locate family members separated by the 
korean war an estimated 10 million koreans were separated from 
family members during the 195053 conflict 
kang said multifaceted exchanges and cooperation between the 
two sides should include free travel across the border during major 
holidays economic and trade cooperation reconnection of broken 
railroad highway mail and telephone service lines and 
recognizing the others existence 
he suggested the two sides jointly develop tourist resources and 
create a northsouth tourist route in the beautiful eastern coast 
called the diamond mountains a haven favored by all koreans 
north and south korea opened two days of formal prime ministers 
talks wednesday at 10 am 9 pm edt tuesday with the 
sevenmember official delegations of both sides sitting across from 
one another at a table in main ballroom of the headquarters hotel 
the premiers smiled and shook hands across the table when 
photographers yelled for them to repeat the action they stood for 
about a minute clasping hands 
north korean prime minister yon hyong muk wearing a communist 
party kim il sung badge waved briefly to onlookers and took his 
seat on the north side of the table the south korean premier sat 
on the south side 
in a relaxed atmosphere the two premiers exchanged small talk 
about the previous evenings dinner and movie and whether each had 
slept well 
kang apologized for a traffic accident in tuesdays arrival 
motorcade in which two north korean diplomats were injured when he 
inquired how they were feeling one of the delegates said he needed 
treatment for his back and the other who injured his jaw said he 
had trouble eating 
talks wednesday and thursday are to focus on easing military and 
political confrontation and launching multilateral exchanges 
subjects general enough to cover almost anything either side wants 
to talk about 
by holding talks communist north korea gives tacit recognition 
to the legitimacy of the south korean government it has steadfastly 
refused to recognize south korea has recognized the north only in 
its call that the two nations submit separate applications for 
united nations membership 
south korean prime minister kang calls the talks thawing the 
thick ice of distrust 
kang said tuesday the talks will be the perfect opportunity to 
erect a glistening milestone in our long march to cast off the 
shackales of division and unify the land 
south korean officials have cautioned against hasty 
expectations saying the talks are only a significant first step of 
a long road toward peace and unification 
north korean radio monitored in tokyo warned seoul to approach 
talks with a sincere attitude and cease from spoiling the 
atmosphere of dialogue 
the 90member north korean delegation crossed the border tuesday 
for a fourday visit that ends friday and includes two movies a 
stage show and sightseeing 
the premiers have opposing ideology but otherwise much in 
common both have roots near the north koreamanchurian border 
theyre both in their 60s were appointed premiers in 1988 and are 
ranked high in their government hierarchy though their 
policymaking roles are limited 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 and the two nations fought a threeyear 
war relations between the koreas are hostile and the north korean 
delegation is only the third to visit in more than 40 years 
earlier tuesday about 200 radical students yelling 
antigovernment slogans and hurling more than 500 blazing firebombs 
battled riot police at seouls korea university eight students 
were arrested for trying to take unification banners to the border 
crossing 
radicals and dissidents are demanding immediate unification and 
the withdrawal of about 43000 us troops positions supported by 
north korea 
soon after their arrival the north koreans asked to visit the 
families of south korean dissidents jailed for illegally visiting 
the north but the government indicated the request would be 
rejected 
the north korean prime minister is staying in a 1500aday 
royal suite at a luxury hotel near the olympic stadium site of the 
1988 summer games

saudi arabia has opened the 
floodgates to more than 250 reporters turning coverage of the us 
troop deployment into what one journalist called a media war 
its phenomenal ray wilkinson newsweeks cairobased 
correspondent said aug 27 wilkinson had a visa request pending 
for 18 months before he was granted one i never thought i would 
see the us military in saudi arabia and i never thought i would 
see us here like this 
saudi officials speaking on condition they not be identified 
said the change in government policy came from the highest levels 
and was partly in reaction to pressure from the united states 
they know public opinion is important one official said of 
the saudi leadership 
most reporters have been given monthlong visas one saudi 
official said major news organizations may be given a permanent 
presence in the kingdom 
the arrival of hundreds of journalists prompted the us defense 
department to disband its 17member media pool aug 26 two weeks 
after the first journalists arrived in the country under the pool 
arrangement writers photographers and television journalists made 
their work available to all news organizations 
some pool reporters complained about restrictions imposed by the 
pentagon but praised the access they were given to ontheground 
operations 
most irksome was the pentagons initial prohibition on the use 
of soldiers names and hometowns on aug 25 the pentagon lifted 
the ban saying the military situation had relaxed 
the pentagon and the saudi government still bar reporters from 
using exact locations when writing about military activities 
navy lt cmdr gregg hartung the pool coordinator said he 
thought the pool worked better than in the past during the 
december invasion of panama for example reporters were furious at 
being penned up away from any action for 24 hours 
i think we still have room for improvement hartung said 
for instance he would have liked daily briefings with operation 
desert shield commanders to give uptodate details of the 
deployment 
but that was impossible because the operation was run out of 
riyadh the saudi capital while the reporters were based 200 miles 
away in dhahran scene of the major deployment 
the invasion of reporters has created a new set of headaches for 
american and saudi officials 
so many people are vying for limited space on official tours 
that the pentagon has given first priority to american reporters 
the saudis have also been besieged by reporters trying to get on 
sponsored trips a near riot broke out among reporters pushing to 
get on buses when the saudis took a group to the border with iraq 
its a media war thats the main feature said alix van 
buren of la repubblica of italy 
bring in a couple thousand copies of scoop said time 
magazines jay peterzell referring to evelyn waughs satirical 
novel about covering an african war a lot of people want to 
reread it

developments in the mideast conflict have 
highlighted again the effect of news coverage on diplomacy 
diplomacy used to be by cable and now its by satellite 
said steve friedman executive producer of nbcs nightly news 
i think its fraught with danger in terms of televisions 
live incapacity to really interpret some of these events said 
reid collins cnn anchorman in washington 
the problem is that communication is instant reaction is 
instant and everybody needs to just slow down said anchorman 
jim lehrer of the macneillehrer news hour on the public 
broadcasting service 
diplomacy by television was born in the middle east when the 
1967 arabisraeli war divided the principals behind battle lines 
when you are unable to have diplomatic contact the reporter 
is the one who is able to get the message said barbara walters 
who covered the middle east for abc in the 70s 
i would go and interview egyptian president anwar sadat 
then i would have to go to israel by way of cyprus because the two 
countries had no direct links and were technically at war and i 
would talk with prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel she 
said 
i remember the feeling of responsibility and i would think 
how ironic and how sad it was that a reporter was going around 
delivering messages between people who could not speak 
the role of television and the tv journalist as mediator reached 
its high point in 1977 when cbs anchorman walter cronkite 
simultaneously interviewed sadat and israeli prime minister 
menachem begin 
on the neutral ground of television cronkite asked sadat if 
he would visit israel yes sadat would go to israel would sadat 
be welcome in jerusalem cronkite asked yes was the answer 
the next day israels invitation arrived in cairo it was 
cnns collins said the genesis of the camp david accords and 
egyptianisraeli peace 
wire services and newspapers have been doing this for a long 
time probably more than a century said robert macneil 
coanchor of the macneillehrer news hour its just that 
television has speeded it up 
tv diplomacy can hinder the understanding of events collins 
said and televisions desire to know the end of the story and to 
summarize events that most often defy summarization can be 
dangerous he said 
if every man and woman in television who did a standup left 
off the last line the world would be much better served collins 
said 
this is not a television show this is a realworld 
confrontation said lehrer

washington post reporter caryle murphy 
willingly traveled to kuwait in late july to cover an unfolding 
international news event she escaped a month later holding 
preciously to her stories and her life 
when murphy arrived in kuwait city iraqi president saddam 
hussein was amassing thousands of troops from his millionman army 
along the iraqikuwaiti border but still promising he would take 
no military action against his tiny neighbor 
in the early morning hours of on aug 2 a week after murphys 
arrival iraqi soldiers quickly rolled over kuwait 
one failed escape attempt and 25 days later murphy arrived in 
saudi arabia after a tense journey across the desert 
the journalist related her trials in a lengthy article published 
in the washington post 
despite the turmoil in kuwait after the invasion murphy said 
she hadnt expected to be trapped 
like most foreigners i assumed that in a few days time 
the borders would be open for those who wanted to leave and that 
the exodus would start but it never happened she wrote 
murphy recalled that she and two other western journalists spent 
the first week after the invasion conducting interviews on the 
streets in hospitals and over the telephone as if we were 
covering any story however she soon discovered that there was 
no way to dispatch material to her newspaper 
after leaving her hotel to live with an american family murphy 
decided to flee the country as the two other journalists already 
had done 
murphy and two other americans set out by car on the morning of 
aug 14 they were back in kuwait city 90 minutes later after being 
turned back by iraqi soldiers 
but murphy decided to try again after she learned of a convoy 
that was planning to leave 
i decided in a minute mostly by instinct i reasoned that the 
worst that could happen was that i would be detained if the iraqis 
spotted me she wrote 
nearly seven hours later murphy arrived at the saudi border 
there she learned from a us diplomat that she was the first 
american to arrive at the outpost in eight days

president mikhail s gorbachev beefed up his press 
office aug 28 by naming a respected soviet magazine editor as his 
personal assistant and chief spokesman 
vitaly n ignatenko is editor of the new times magazine which 
under his stewardship has played a significant role in gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness 
ignatenko is expected to play a larger role in policymaking 
than either his predecessor arkady maslennikov or his american 
counterpart marlin fitzwater 
ignatenko 49 who speaks some english is one of a handful of 
top soviet journalists who reputedly have enjoyed regular access to 
gorbachev and gained his confidence 
one sign of his influence is his title assistant to the 
president and head of the presidential press service the assistant 
to the president designation is new 
maslennikov whose performance was widely viewed as lackluster 
has returned to his former position as press aide to the chairman 
of the supreme soviet legislature 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov who 
announced the changes at a news conference said maslennikov would 
begin working for anatoly lukyanov gorbachevs successor as 
supreme soviet chairman 
maslennikov developed a reputation among both soviet and foreign 
reporters in moscow for being difficult to reach and not returning 
phone calls he also made some high profile mistakes such as 
failing to put down a rumor about gorbachevs health during his 
june summit meeting with president bush 
asked at a press conference in washington whether it was true 
gorbachev planned to undergo testing for diabetes in minnesota 
maslennikov replied that there were many scientific experts in 
minnesota with whom the soviet leader might consult his answer 
allowed the rumor to live for several hours before being firmly 
denied by other soviet officials 
ignatenko has a reputation for accessibility and clarity 
he is easygoing with a very good sense of humor said his 
deputy at novoye vremya new times aleksandr pumpyansky but 
hes also a professional journalist whose language is very precise 
he knows all the nuances 
the weekly magazine which is published in russian and several 
other languages including english has published articles critical 
of the soviet military and some of its allies such as cuba this 
summer it carried a revisionist history of the korean war laying 
considerable blame on the north korean side for the first time

former lebanon hostage brian keenan said 
he saw terry anderson in captivity about 11 months ago and the 
associated press correspondent was well 
keenan a native of belfast northern ireland was handed over 
to irish authorities in syria on aug 25 
he described the 42yearold anderson as pacing the floor in 
tattered socks with a voracious appetite for intellectual 
conversation 
he said anderson sometimes kept him awake for hours 
i think he debated with himself a lot while we tried to plug 
our ears keenan joked 
keenan said guards sometimes gave anderson antibiotics during 
bouts of stomach trouble 
terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak 
with great pain and remorse and longing for his first daughter 
gabrielle with many tears he would elaborate his plans when he was 
finally back in the states to help her to shape and discover her 
future 
in those confessional moments which were common to us all a 
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed 
anderson has never seen his second daughter sulome born three 
months after he was abducted 
anderson the aps chief middle east correspondent was abducted 
march 16 1985 and is the longest held of the 13 westerners

defenders of first amendment rights lament the 
retirement of supreme court justice william j brennan but say the 
views of his prospective replacement david h souter on freedom 
of speech and the press are somewhat encouraging 
no one could conclude he has an ax to grind against the media 
or against first amendment claims henry kaufman of the promedia 
libel defense resource center said of souter arguably we will 
get a fair hearing but hes no brennan 
brennan retired in july after a 34year career as the high 
courts leading voice of liberalism he wrote a 1964 landmark 
opinion giving the news media broad protection against libel suits 
by public figures and recently wrote opinions barring criminal 
prosecution of those who burn the american flag in protest 
the senate judiciary committee is scheduled to begin hearings on 
souters nomination sept 13 most of what is known of his views 
have come from his writings as a new hampshire state judge 
president bush named souter to the 1st us circuit court of 
appeals in boston this year 
some who have studied the handful of opinions souter wrote on 
first amendment issues during his seven years on the new hampshire 
supreme court say they are heartened that bush didnt choose 
someone with apparent rigid ideas that could limit free expression 
i think hes been very balanced on freepress issues said 
claudia haskell of the first amendment congress hes in the 
mainstream 
however the advocates said they dont expect souter to be an 
ardent defender of free expression if he wins confirmation 
kaufman said souters opinions seem to reflect more interest 
in the complexity of the law than a passion for the 
underlying rights at issue 
souters decisions seem to reflect a cautious craftsman whose 
views are not expansive in protecting first amendment rights 
said floyd abrams a new york lawyer whose clients include the news 
media 
some commentators said they were encouraged that souter had 
expressed in cases unrelated to the first amendment strong 
support for supreme court precedent 
jane kirtley head of the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press said she was pleased that souter appears to have little 
inclination to topple key rulings 
lets face it weve got some good court decisions sitting up 
there right now she said i dont see anything that would 
suggest souter would be antimedia

fed up with bigcity newspapers missing 
all but the most sensational crimes a florida man is publishing a 
tabloid listing every local arrest including those for alleged 
shoplifting and drunken driving 
the informer plans to fight crime by filling pages with a 
blotterstyle listing of every suspect even though theyre 
innocent until proven guilty 
this is going to be a deterrent said publisher ray aden 
what is happening is the great majority of people violating our 
laws are not known to their neighbors their bosses sometimes 
even their family 
but nobody wants to get their name in the paper 
some daily newspapers already print crime blotter information 
theres nothing unlawful about printing arrests from the public 
record but civil libertarians and attorneys say the tabloid is 
treading dangerous legal ground and could trample the rights of the 
accused 
from a small office in this st petersburg suburb aden and a 
handful of employees are busy preparing for the oct 3 premiere of 
the twicemonthly 89cent publication 
aden a 70yearold marketing analyst has spent nine months and 
more than 150000 getting ready the paper will be about half 
advertising and half listings of arrests along with articles such 
as how to deal with obscene phone calls 
the areas big dailies report only a few arrests a day focusing 
on major murders and drug busts but each issue of the informer is 
designed to bulge up to 48 pages and list hundreds of arrests in 
st petersburg clearwater and surrounding pinellas county 
communities 
all of them list only the standard booking information name 
address age and arresting charge 
were not crime reporting or editorializing thats not the 
concept aden said we give the community information it 
probably will evolve into more area crime watches which will 
benefit the community 
and on every page beneath boldface headlines reading domestic 
violence and shoplifting disclaimers in the newspapers 
tiniest type read note being arrested does not mean the person 
is guilty 
they have an absolute right to print arrests said robyn 
blumner executive director of the american civil liberties union 
in florida but i would only hope the public is smart enough to 
know that arrests by themselves are legally irrelevant 
patricia anderson a libel attorney whose clients include the 
st petersburg times said publishing arrests is fine but they had 
better be accurate 
one wrong first name or one wrong middle initial and you could 
have a big lawsuit on your hands she said

who wrote in june having received this letter on my 65th 
birthday i have no choice but to send it on as ordered i am

enough to ignore the warning

said he received the chain letter from two friends but was too 
busy covering the persian gulf crisis and writing a book to pay any 
attention 
so far my lucks been pretty good he said maybe its

pennsylvanias superior court says a newspaper 
can attend hearings on sexual abuse allegations involving a priest 
and see some court papers but not all of those produced in 
preparation for the case 
the aug 28 ruling was the first by an appeals court in the 
state to uphold access to civil pleadings and proceedings 
pittsburgh press attorney scott e henderson said 
this will make it easier for the public and press to view 
those parts of the judicial process he said 
the superior court decision said the newspaper does not have 
access to discovery documents or information developed by the 
two sides in a case to prepare for trial 
the case is based on a lawsuit filed by an akron ohio man who 
says he was 9 or 10 years old when he was first sexually molested 
by the rev francis e luddy 
the 21yearold man says the abuse occurred for six to seven 
years 
luddy was assigned to the altoonajohnstown diocese at the time 
and is now on a leave of absence 
the diocese had requested that all documents in the case be 
sealed and all pretrial proceedings be held behind closed doors 
a lower court judge denied both requests and was reversed on 
the issue of discovery arguments 
in doing so the superior court referred to an earlier decision 
it issued that said there was no legal right for the public to 
inspect discovery materials

became the focus of journalistic debate 
we would not do that under any circumstances said bob 
mcfarland nbc deputy director of news we made that decision the 
first day they pumped it out we decided it was pure propaganda 
none of the big three american networks nbc abc and cbs 
aired the iraqi transmission live on aug 28 as cnn did instead 
they showed portions somewhat later 
cnn said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as 
possible 
we make these decisions on a casebycase basis said cnn 
spokesman steve haworth adding that cnn understood that saddam 
would be speaking with american hostages there was no question 
in our minds this would be newsworthy 
cnn explained to viewers that the broadcast was an iraqi tv 
feed and afterward cnn featured a debate over the wisdom of the 
decisions it had made 
its a decision the other networks see differently 
at nbc we would not put iraqi tv on the air without first 
knowing what it was mcfarland said we took every frame of it 
into the house looked at it and then selected two or three 
bites 
wherever there is a hostage videotape a captive videotape 
its a decision we dont take lightly said sherrie rollins abc 
director of news information the president of abc news has to 
approve the use of such video she said 
when saddam appeared on television on aug 23 with western 
hostages abc joined the iraqi satellite feed live for a few 
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content 
of the material 
we did air the material we did feel it was newsworthy ms 
rollins said 
but when saddam appeared with hostages again aug 28 abc taped 
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special 
report by anchorman peter jennings she said 
after the first appearance on cnn pati heath of detroit the 
sister of an american hostage called the atlantabased network to 
say she had seen her brother on tv 
cnn then put her on television too 
im just happy to be able to see my brothers face she 
said i hope hussein sees me talking right now 
the first us interview with saddam went to cbs news anchor dan 
rather on aug 29 
cbs said the taped interview lasted 90 minutes and began shortly 
after midnight in baghdad rather was told there would be no 
interview that day but suddenly was summoned to the presidential 
palace 
there were no restrictions on what rather could ask said cbs 
spokeswoman donna dees the only conditions were that iraqi tv 
cameras be used and that it be a onehour interview that would air 
as recorded she said 
he agreed to let the interview run longer so it could be cut for 
translation and minor editing dees said

a 52 million libel damage award to singer 
wayne newton from nbc was overturned aug 30 by a federal appeals 
court it said a broadcast suggesting mob ties in newtons purchase 
of a casino was not shown to be deliberately or recklessly false 
a jury in las vegas found that the television networks october 
1980 story about a federal investigation of the singers 
acquisition of the aladdin hotel and casino had created a false 
impression that criminal organizations had helped in the purchase 
in exchange for a hidden share and that newton had deceived nevada 
gaming officials 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in a 30 ruling said 
most of the factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed 
and that any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate 
or reckless 
for example the court said citing evidence in the case newton 
had contacted a purported organized crime figure guido penosi 
about a problem penosi had arranged a solution and penosi and an 
associate later discussed the possibility of profiting from 
newtons ownership of the aladdin a subject that came under 
federal investigation 
newton testified that he asked penosi to stop organized crime 
threats against himself and his daughter that subject was not 
mentioned in the nbc story the court said newton had testified 
falsely to the state gaming board about his relationship with 
penosi 
the court did not say whether the story as a whole was false 
an issue it did not have to address instead it found a lack of 
evidence that the journalists had either deliberately lied or had 
been reckless with the truth that standard must be met by public 
figures or public officials suing the news media for libel 
the court said us district judge myron crocker who reduced 
the jurys 193 million libel award to 52 million erroneously 
allowed the damages to be based on a conclusion that nbc should 
have realized its broadcast would give a false impression 
what journalists should have realized or foreseen is irrelevant 
in a libel suit by a public figure which must be based on what a 
journalist actually knew and intended said the appellate decision 
by judge william norris 
he said crocker also improperly substituted his own view as 
to the supposed impression left by the broadcast for that of the 
journalists who prepared the broadcast 
newton had argued that the storys failure to mention the 
threats against him as the reason he had contacted penosi was a 
deliberate omission of the truth but norris said the reporters had 
reasons to doubt that threats had been made noting that they had 
gotten a denial from newtons lawyer 
norris said the broadcasts statement that newton had financial 
problems at the time of the purchase was true the broadcast had 
some ambiguities about his financial arrangements and testimony 
which might have been cleared up by different wording but 
editorial decisions about broadcasts are best left to editors 
not to judges and juries norris said

gary watson a 21year veteran of gannett co 
inc has been named president of a newly consolidated newspaper 
division in the company 
watson has been president of its 60member community newspaper 
division for the past 4 years the division will be combined with 
gannetts metropolitan newspaper group whose current president 
brian j donnelly will become executive vice president reporting 
to watson 
watson will oversee all of gannetts daily papers except usa 
today after the change scheduled for oct 1 
in a story aug 30 the washington post said watsons promotion 
fueled rumors that he was being groomed to become president and 
chief operating officer 
mimi feller gannetts vice president for public affairs denied 
speculation that he would become secondincommand to gannett 
chairmanpresident john j curley 
feller said the companys chief financial officer douglas h 
mccorkindale and usa today publisher cathleen p black would 
remain in those positions 
there have been no changes in cathy blacks or dougs 
positions and there are no additional changes coming up in 
garys position she said 
watson according to the post said the consolidation was partly 
in response to the increasingly tough environment for newspaper 
advertising 
gannetts newspaper revenue fell 2 percent in the second quarter 
compared with a year ago and was down 1 percent for the first six 
months of this year 
but feller said the post was off base when it implied that 
economics was the reason for the change she said the consolidation 
and promotion of watson just makes sense organizationally at 
this time 
she said gannett created the two newspaper divisions in 1985 
when we were making some larger acquisitions of papers but 
now weve found that it would be better to have it in one place 
you dont need to have the overlap 
she said the change would not mean any reductions in personnel 
its totally an administrative restructuring not a reduction 
in personnel or savings in costs she said noting that both 
divisions previously had been operating under one corporate staff 
the corporate staff stays the same the folks running the papers 
in the field stay the same 
watson 45 started with gannett in 1969 at its rockford ill 
register star he held various editing and reporting jobs with the 
company and later was named president of its midwestern newspaper 
division and president of the cincinnati enquirer

singer josephine baker was black danced 
naked and reveled in her sexuality from the 1920s until she died 
15 years ago most americans shunned her 
yet europeans loved the performer and her skin color and found 
little risque in her blatant exposure of it when baker was 
penniless toward the end of her life princess grace of monaco 
cared for her 
suddenly eight decades after her birth she now is the focus of 
three american films but it hardly denotes a surge in social 
consciousness the story of these movies is mostly about money 
bigname stars and rushing to capitalize on a very marketable story 
and how that process escalates once someone makes the first move 
home box office has the only completed version the josephine 
baker story will debut on the pay cable channel in february 1991 
the hbo version starring relative unknown lynn whitfield cost 8 
million and is the most expensive movie ever made by the 
18yearold network 
in march rival media mogul ted turner promised to deliver a 
major announcement during a press conference held the day after 
the academy awards ceremony 
at the beverly hills gathering turner giddily presented 
singeractress diana ross and proclaimed the former supremes leader 
would be the executive producer and star of a threehour cable 
movie about baker for turner network television 
almost six months later the project has no script no director 
no shooting schedule and no casting outside of ross 
dolly partons sandollar company is planning a 20 million 
feature film covering one year in bakers life the project will be 
directed by hugh hudson whose 1981 chariots of fire won the 
oscar for best picture but this bigscreen version has no finished 
script and no release date 
although the latter two versions are far behind hbos ambitious 
schedule make no mistake about the intent of all three filmmakers 
not one has considered shelving the product and all claim theirs 
is the best 
hbo cites the mammoth scope of its film which covered bakers 
life from age 19 to 68 employed 6000 extras and shot for nine 
weeks on 100 locations in hungary it is produced by david puttnam 
and directed by brian gibson who also made the emmywinning 
murderers among us the simon wisenthal story for hbo 
for now turner is content to hang all project credibility on 
rosss involvement until we have a wonderful script we really 
just have to bank on diana and i think shes pretty bankable 
said linda berman tnts head of development 
howard rosenman one of five coproducers on the bigscreen 
sandollar version said he doesnt take the cable movies seriously 
theres no challenge between the director of chariots of 
fire and the guy who did the simon wisenthal story rosenman 
said 
if most americans were scandalized by baker in the early part of 
this century few today know the enormity or impact of her life 
abroad 
her infamous banana dance in which she appeared naked save for 
a belt of fake bananas became the trademark of european revues 
she did more however than sing and dance in the nude 
baker was a tireless advocate of civil rights in world war ii 
she was a spy for the french resistance carrying intelligence 
information about german troop concentrations scrawled in invisible 
ink on her sheet music 
it was a long way from st louis where as a child she lived in 
an abandoned railroad car 
as a young woman in the early 1920s baker wanted to be famous 
americans wanted her to scrub their floors she fled to paris 
where color was less a discriminatory factor 
at the height of her paris glory she returned to new york and 
appeared in the 1936 ziegfeld follies with fanny brice and bob 
hope but the american public still was not ready for baker 
critics panned her in racist reviews 
humiliated she returned to europe in the 1950s her body 
ravaged by numerous surgeries that left her sterile she adopted 12 
children from around the world calling them her rainbow tribe 
tragedy illness and several marriages took their toll once the 
richest black person in the world baker was destitute shortly 
before her death 
she died in her sleep on the second night of a phenomenally 
successful comeback show in paris 
its a classic story said robert cooper senior vice 
president of hbo pictures the first thing i asked was if this 
is true why hasnt it been told 
the reason 
i think people just didnt know how to do it he said 
why now 
once one person decides to do it it forces everyone else to 
finalize their plans cooper said i think he who comes out 
first has a big advantage

a burly goodnatured texan softspoken and a 
little shy forest whitaker doesnt exactly stand out in a crowd 
but in hollywood where unemployment is the rule not the 
exception he does ok 
whitaker has been one of the kids in fast times at ridgemont 
high the dude who poolhustled paul newman in the color of 
money a rocksteady platoon grunt and robin williams 
sidekick in good morning vietnam 
two years ago he got a bestactor award at the cannes film 
festival as the tortured modern jazz pioneer charlie parker in 
clint eastwoods bird 
there was no oscar nomination but many good reviews which 
tided him over 
i guess the reward is to be appreciated for your work 
whitaker says 
on saturday hes in a home box office movie criminal 
justice as a fundamentally decent excon trying to stay straight 
but wrongly accused of slashing and robbing a crackaddicted 
prostitute in brooklyn 
it is a horrifying trip through what singer tom waits once 
called the bowels of due process whitaker a methodical man 
researched it before and while making the film in pittsburgh five 
months ago 
he hung out in the courts and in prison observing listening to 
prisoners talking with their families trying to make bail he even 
did a little time behind bars he said trying to get the moves 
the look right 
a lot of prisoners didnt know who he was those who did he 
said would say things like well what are you doing here what 
did you do 
but it was similar in a way he said to the time he hung out 
with people in the medical profession taking notes for the plastic 
surgeon he played in the film johnny handsome 
the people are sometimes pretty helpful he said because 
they want their stories to be told properly 
whitaker has been lucky enough to work fairly often since fast 
times in 1982 
he once planned to sing opera but switched to theater while in 
college but his musical background has helped notably in bird 
he didnt actually play the alto sax heard in the film but he 
learned enough to fake it then to get sounds from it and then 
music 
but until recently he hadnt touched the horn the reason he 
was too deeply affected by what hed gone through portraying 
parker a junkie genius who died in 1955 at age 34 
when i played the horn it reminded me of a lot of emotions 
that i was dealing with when i played the part said whitaker 
so i avoided playing for a while it took a while to wash it 
off to get rid of it 
the actor also has been having a go at writing putting together 
his first screenplay pick a card over the course of seven 
years its a comedy about a con man and a threecard monte dealer 
who works the streets 
theres no deal for that yet and none is imminent he said 
two weeks after making criminal justice he proceeded to yet 
another new role this one in a film comedy rage in harlem in 
that one due out next year he costars with danny glover and 
gregory hines playing a morticians accountant 
he also at 29 is making his debut as a coproducer having 
served in that capacity on rage he laughed when asked if 
whitaker the actor ever argued with whitaker the producer 
no he said but hes now a bit more sympathetic to producers 
they have to think about stuff i never would think about 
before he said things i would just ignore and say well im 
an actor 
he knows that for an actor to be sympathetic towards producers 
constitutes heresy in some quarters 
yeah but they have a pretty difficult job sometimes he 
said but as long as youre working toward the same goal it 
works out

delbert larson scanned the empty woods 
where the posse comitatus once envisioned a paramilitary settlement 
for white supremacists a haven from government regulations and 
taxes 
americans are blind and deaf he says explaining why the 
settlement failed we tried to do what we thought was a job to 
alert the people 
larson 66 is one of the few remnants of the posse just a 
decade ago they trained with guns built underground shelters 
vowed to rebel against government and caused a stir in this tiny 
central wisconsin town 
he now lives alone in a makeshift home on the rolling 
countryside just east of tigerton a whitehaired man with steely 
blue eyes who cuts wood for heat and reads the bible for spiritual 
comfort 
most of the posses militant leaders including flamboyant 
businessman james wickstrom and tigerton farmer donald 
minniecheske are sitting in prison after a government crackdown in 
the mid1980s 
townsfolk have pronounced the posse dead since 1985 when 
officers swooped onto the hundreds of acres of property the group 
had assembled and removed some trailer homes that violated county 
zoning laws 
but shawano county district attorney gary r bruno isnt 
convinced 
some evidence indicates hate groups in the united states are 
becoming bigger and badder bruno said adding the posse 
epitomized such groups with its loathing of jews blacks taxes and 
government 
the groups activities petered out in wisconsin because the 
leaders were silenced the prosecutor said 
you cut off the head of a snake and the rest of the snake can 
worm around but it cant bite you anymore he said 
the government considered the posse dangerous lawbreakers 
hatemongers and potential killers something akin to organized 
crime at least six posse members have been convicted of crimes 
ranging from theft to tax evasion 
wickstrom 47 was sentenced aug 7 in pennsylvania to 38 months 
in prison for conspiring to distribute 100000 in counterfeit 
money he left wisconsin in 1985 shortly after serving 13 months 
for impersonating a municipal official in the posses selfcreated 
township of tigerton dells 
minniecheske 56 upon whose farm land the posses compound was 
to flourish is serving a nineyear prison sentence in wisconsin 
for destruction of property possession of stolen property and 
transfer of stolen property 
gordon kahl a north dakota tax protester linked to the posse 
was killed june 3 1983 during the second of two shootouts with 
police seeking to arrest him for tax evasion those shootouts left 
three federal marshals dead 
residents link the origins of the posse to a day in the late 
1970s when minniecheske dumped two loads of sand along a river for 
a swimming beach said tigerton police chief charles gehrman state 
officials objected he had no permit and his outrage against the 
government interference fueled a movement 
some residents said the posse had legitimate complaints about 
government but the wrong approach to solving them 
they had support until they started going crazy with stuff 
when they started flashing those guns said kevin maas a logger 
who remembers seeing at least one posse member in town with a 
pistol strapped to his hip 
the tigerton dells bar and ranch the posses headquarters and 
home for the minniecheske family still displays a large picture 
of the late us sen joseph mccarthy the anticommunist crusader 
of the 1950s 
thats been here since 1964 minniecheskes wife sally 
explained he was a good friend of donalds dad 
up the road the driveway to the former posse compound is marked 
with ominous signs private property no trespassing 
keep out 
a mailbox labeled life science church christian liberty 
academy provides the only hint of the church building that once 
nestled in the trees the government has alleged the church was 
nothing more than a front used by the group to evade taxes 
relatives visit donald minniecheske twice a week in prison 
i dont think they have broken him not at all said 
minniecheskes son james prison will never change him 
meanwhile his wife children and grandchildren host the church 
in their tavern we survive mrs minniecheske said shrugging 
her shoulders the church takes care of what we need 
mrs minniecheske estimated 30 to 40 posse members still live in 
the tigerton area farming and sharing financial resources the 
government however is seeking to foreclose their property for 
back taxes 
jeremy erickson 13 one of mrs minniecheskes 19 
grandchildren remembers the military maneuvers and survival 
training at the compound 
when the posse was here it was kind of fun the boy said 
these guys used to line up in camouflage and shoot their 
guns in the river they really didnt scare us all of them were 
pretty nice they didnt want to hurt anybody they were all 
against the government because our government is corrupt he said 
james minniecheske 33 wonders whether the posse should be 
revived 
if it keeps my kids free from all this tyranny lets do it 
he said 
but the jailing of posse leaders scares people from trying to 
do anything he said i think guns are the only way to get our 
freedoms back

the venerable yiddish newspaper forward tutor 
and friend to generations of immigrants is taking a giant step out 
of the lower east side with a national englishlanguage weekly 
faced with diminishing readership of its yiddish edition the 
93yearold forward is braving a depressed newspaper market and 
ignoring widespread opinion that there is no need for a national 
jewish newspaper 
its owners are confident theyve located a niche among their 
competition and believe their publishing legacy will give them the 
powerful boost needed to succeed 
yiddish readers are very loyal and have an emotional tie with 
the paper historically said harold ostroff cochairman of 
forward publishing co they feel its a part of the family in a 
sense 
the forward traces its heritage back to 1897 when it emerged 
from the socialist labor movement to take up the cudgel of the 
yiddishspeaking working class 
the paper initially a daily served as teacher political 
advocate spiritual guide and psychiatrist for its readers mostly 
jewish immigrants to the united states it published everything 
from a famous advice column a bintel brief a bundle of 
letters to the writings of isaac bashevis singer during the 
early part of the century its readers numbered more than 250000 
but as the immigrants were assimilated into american society the 
number of yiddish speakers declined and so did the newspapers 
circulation 
the paper went weekly in 1983 and began to publish an 
englishlanguage supplement its circulation is now about 17000 
recognizing the need to shore up its readership and attract 
descendants of readers past the publishers have expanded the 
englishlanguage insert into a paper in its own right 
the first few issues of the paper which was first published may 
25 were distributed in the new york area only national 
circulation will begin friday with a projected circulation of 
30000 
like the yiddish forward the new paper combines news with 
social and cultural commentary about 40 percent of the paper will 
be hard news and analysis 40 percent cultural coverage and 
fiction and 20 percent editorial pages said seth lipsky editor 
of the forward and president of forward publishing co 
but lipsky said he realizes that reputation alone will not carry 
the fledgling paper 
the yiddish paper already has a deficit so the papers will 
share material along with circulation and advertising programs in 
some markets to ease costs 
the forward is entering a specialized market in which more than 
100 jewish publications are jostling for position the toughest 
challenge among them will come from the regional jewish presses 
new york city where lipsky expects half of his circulation has 
three established weeklies 
lipsky though believes there is room for his publication in 
each of the nations major cities his niche he said is in 
providing international and national jewish news coverage beyond 
what the larger metropolitan dailies and regional jewish papers 
offer 
his paper already has opened bureaus in jerusalem moscow 
paris washington and new york and will supplement the offices 
with stringers freelancers and news wire services there are plans 
to open bureaus in other cities including miami chicago and los 
angeles 
lipsky believes there are enough major jewish stories now to 
launch a paper he cites the rise of a antisemitic movement in the 
soviet union the prevailing conflict in israel and the 
democratization of eastern europe 
but jewish editors around the country and observers of the 
jewish press are less certain it will find a market 
i have a philosophy that our readership is much more 
interested in the news of the local jewish community than in news 
of the international jewish community said marc klein editor 
and publisher of the northern california jewish bulletin which has 
a circulation of about 27000 
klein who also is president of the american jewish press 
association said 70 percent to 80 percent of his paper is devoted 
to local stories 
gary rosenblatt editor of the baltimore jewish times agrees 
in baltimore they want to know from whos getting married to 
whos having a bar mitzvah to more weightier issues said 
rosenblatt whose paper has a circulation of about 20000 
abraham h foxman national director of the antidefamation 
league and a selfdescribed news junkie believes the forwards 
association with the yiddish forward will at least draw attention 
to the new paper 
the name forward has history has meaning in anglojewish 
life he said 
the national paper wont survive on forwards readers he said 
but there is a nostalgic element jews feel sensitive to 
tradition and continuity and history that will help the forward 
initially

dead dolphins are washing up on spains 
eastern mediterranean coast in unusually high numbers causing 
marine biologists and ecologists to suspect a viral epidemic is 
killing them 
many scientists and environmental activists believe the deaths 
are the inevitable outcome of largescale dumping of toxic 
pollutants in the mediterranean by petrochemical plants 
esteve grau a university of barcelona biologist said 
preliminary results of autopsies on three of the dead mammals 
showed extremely high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs 
were working on the hypothesis that the dolphins ate 
pcbcontaminated fish and that this severely weakened their immune 
systems making them susceptible to a stillunidentified virus 
grau said in a telephone interview 
pcbs are liquid resinous or crystalline organic compounds used 
in industrial processes as lubricants heattransfer fluids or to 
give strength or flexibility to wood metal or concrete 
we believe the scientists hypothesis to be correct said 
xavier pastor head of the greenpeace environmental groups office 
in palma capital of the spanish island of majorca in the 
mediterranean 
he said the toxicity of pcbs and their resistance to 
decomposition make them especially dangerous to mammals 
the epidemic appears similar to others that killed up to 800 
seals in the north sea off the netherlands in 1988 and in another 
case under study in california pastor said 
he said some of the dead dolphins had been found on beaches near 
palma in the balearic archipelago 150 miles south of barcelona 
grau and other scientists from the barcelona zoo the marineland 
aquatic park and the university of valencia have conducted 10 
autopsies on dolphins they are trying to determine why only 
striped dolphin and not fish have been killed he said 
dr joaquim piza of marineland said doubts remained about 
whether pcbs caused the dolphins to die 
if that were the case its most likely dolphins of other 
species would have been affected he said in a telephone 
interview 
the autopsies have not produced conclusive evidence that the 
pcbs are the cause the only thing we have been able to determine 
so far with certainty is that the dolphins suffered a weakening of 
their immune systems 
piza said there was some speculation the dolphins had contracted 
a herpestype virus that attacked their immune systems 
between 12 and 20 infirm or aged striped dolphins are found 
washed up every summer on spains eastern beaches and on majorca 
grau said but there have been more than 100 this year he said the 
striped dolphin is not an endangered species and is abundant in the 
mediterranean 
scientists fear the presence of pcbs eventually may reduce the 
number of dolphins by affecting reproduction in addition to killing 
the weaker ones grau said 
we estimate that only 1 percent of affected dolphins have 
washed up he said which means the total number that have 
succumbed to the viral epidemic could be as high as 10000 
pastor noted that industrial and chemical companies continue 
dumping tons of toxic waste including pcbs into the mediterranean 
from plants along spains mediterranean coast from barcelona to 
algeciras adjacent to gibraltar 
weve called on spains autonomous regional governments and 
the central government in madrid to set up a plan to gradually but 
definitively end all industrial toxic waste dumping into the 
mediterranean by the end of 1991 he said 
weve tried to work with industrial companies directly but 
they have refused to acknowledge how much they dump into the 
mediterranean saying it might reveal industrial secrets to 
competitors 
he said greenpeace had found it difficult to develop estimates 
of the amount of pcbs companies in spain dump into the 
mediterranean

when capt francisco mena deserted 
the army and joined el salvadors guerrillas they greeted him with 
tentative embraces hard stares and skepticism 
for a year a veteran fighter known as fredy never let mena walk 
behind him 
there was a ceremony that was a bit awkward mena who 
changed sides in 1981 told an interviewer i gave a talk and 
afterward the guerrillas began asking questions 
some of those questions he said were why did you stay so 
long in the army how many operations did you take part in how 
many of us have you killed 
damn i thought what have i gotten myself into here i 
came to help these guys and theyre busting my chops mena said 
he smiled at the recollection and brushed one hand through his 
wavy black hair the 47yearold rebel commander was in the 
delegation that on aug 22 ended a fruitless round of peace talks 
here with the government of alfredo cristiani the salvadoran 
president 
a nearly 11yearold civil war between the leftist farabundo 
marti national liberation front and a succession of usbacked 
governments has killed an estimated 72000 people most of them 
civilians 
the trip to costa rica was menas first involvement in the 
monthly negotiations and his first respite from the fighting in 
years 
he was included because the exclusive subject of the talks this 
month was a rebel demand that the armed forces be purged of corrupt 
officers and reformed that issue is the main sticking point in the 
negotations 
col mauricio vargas as a member of the government delegation 
protects the militarys interests at the talks 
officially the salvadoran military holds mena in contempt in 
the words of col orlando zepeda vice minister of defense that 
traitor and murderer has no moral right to make accusations or 
demands on us 
classmates at the military and some other officers however 
have demonstrated a camaraderie with mena that could help promote 
eventual accord 
lt col mauricio duke shook hands and chatted amiably with 
mena his former superior when they met in the lobby of the hotel 
where the talks were held 
mena gave a copy of his book from the national army to the 
guerrilla army to duke who responded with a sly smile 
gracias my captain 
the copy like another sent to vargas was inscribed lets 
not forget the 15th of october 
that is the date in 1979 when young officers vargas mena and 
duke included overthrew the rightist dictatorship of gen carlos 
humberto romero 
a broadbased government whose objective was national 
reconciliation resulted but a purge of the military old guard 
faltered repression and death squads followed and the result was 
civil war 
mena traces his change of heart to a year as an officer of the 
national guard a militarized police force 
he described counterinsurgency tactics that included torture 
rape and murder of alleged leftists and told of an initiation rite 
during which he declined an invitation to drive a bayonet through 
the heart of a suspect 
while he pondered such brutality later in his airconditioned 
office mena said the suspect and 11 others were killed in the 
gymnasium of the national guard headquarters 
that kind of thing consolidated my change of thinking by 
making me profoundly question the role we military men were 
playing he said it became denigrating for me to wear the 
national guard insignia 
the proclamation issued by those who carried out the 1979 coup 
promised respect for human rights an end to corruption and 
modernization of a semifeudal economy that left most salvadorans 
destitute 
peace is possible if military authorities honor those goals 
mena said but added the picture is this were getting nowhere 
in negotiations so lets have at it with the irons 
fredy the guerrilla fighter so wary of mena was killed in 
combat in 1985 
just before he died mena said they had a conversation in which 
fredy told him 
in those early days i didnt trust you a bit like you were 
still the enemy who ever would have believed that wed come to be 
like brothers that id gladly give my life for you

pat packer met ross williams when she was 38 and 
married him three years later even as they said their vows the 
bride could hear her biological clock ticking as soon as i left 
the altar i knew it was time to start making a kid 
now 47 packerwilliams a graphic designer in winchester 
mass is the mother of 4yearold gavin and 17monthold colin a 
situation that confounds financial planners 
theyre used to helping people plan for either retirement or 
college tuition you never hear about plans for people with both 
financial planners take note packerwilliams represents a small 
but growing group of women who are pushing natures envelope 
delaying motherhood until after their 40th birthdays 
these women arent pioneers though the over40 phenomenon is 
undergoing a revival whats new is a more optimistic outlook for 
lateinlife pregnancies the result of encouraging research 
a study in the new england journal of medicine in march showed 
no evidence that advanced age reduces a healthy womans chances of 
delivering a healthy baby the mount sinai school of medicine 
researchers cautioned that their findings may not apply to women 
over 40 too small a group to yield reliable data but an 
accompanying editorial called the message clear and optimistic 
the bottom line of the papers is that people today are in much 
better shape and that changes the whole concept of being 
pregnant says dr manuel alvarez assistant professor of 
obstetrics and gynecology at mount sinai 
role models abound actresses bette midler glenn close ursula 
andress vanessa redgrave and jane seymour all gave birth to 
healthy first babies after 40 patti lupone 41yearold star of 
the abc series life goes on is expecting her first child in 
november and cbs recently announced it would scale back face to 
face with connie chung this fall to accommodate the 44yearold 
newswomans efforts to have a baby 
after consulting with my doctors i became convinced that to 
make this effort i now need to take a very aggressive approach to 
having a baby she said in a statement 
should she succeed chung will join a tiny sorority first 
births to women over 40 accounted for just 6909 of the 39 million 
babies born in america during 1988 
they have much in common these predominantly white 
middleclass collegeeducated urban professionals they often 
marry later if at all putting off family for career and as a 
result sandwich themselves between aging parents and young 
children 
years of dieting and aerobics have paid off i think of myself 
as indomitable says tina waltonvirta 43 mother of 
15monthold olivia but like most older mothers she is ever 
mindful of the realities its very sad when i think about not 
being able to participate in her life for as long as id like 
for now the biggest problem is postpartum exhaustion its 
not having a baby at 45 its having a 2yearold at 47 says 
polly ham a teacher and potter on lopez island wash 
women over 40 have been having first babies for years in each 
of the years from 1950 to 1955 more women over 40 gave birth for 
the first time than did so during 1987 the census bureau reports 
between 1970 and 1986 the rate of first births increased by 50 
percent for women 40 to 44 a natural progression of the growing 
numbers of career women over 35 who began having babies more than a 
decade ago 
at 30 my cutoff was 35 at 35 my cutoff was 40 when you 
really want to have a child you just keep moving the cutoff point 
later says ham 
at 45 she gave birth to laurel like waltonvirta and 
packerwilliams ham is married to a man nine years her junior 
its almost like watching evolution in progress the way 
nature accommodates these lifestyle changes says new york 
obstetrician jonathan scher firsttime mothers over 40 constitute 
20 percent of his practice a fivefold increase from a decade ago 
that isnt to say the next trend will be motherhood after 50 
we will reach a biological limit and we are getting close to 
it says dr siegfried rotmensch a highrisk specialist at 
yalenew haven hospital in connecticut 
for the time being the pattern is apt to continue in a 1989 
census bureau survey more than half of childless married women 30 
to 34 said they still planned to have babies 
not all will get their wish one in six of all couples is 
infertile and fertility decreases with age rotmensch says about 
90 percent of 25yearold women not using birth control will get 
pregnant within a year at 40 that figure drops to 30 percent 
todays infertility specialists have more to offer women unable 
to conceive on their own but the conception rate among 
artificially inseminated women also declines with age in vitro 
fertilization has proven less successful in older women as well 
mary ellen conway an art therapist in a boston suburb spent 
two years undergoing infertility treatment before giving up i 
had completely resigned myself to not having a child and under the 
circumstances was adjusting very well 
now shes adjusting to 4monthold jacob the baby she 
inexplicably conceived at 43 after so many years without children 
parenthood takes considerable getting used to says steven shade 
the 37yearold artist conway married nine years ago 
the downside is that we had really developed a certain 
lifestyle for ourselves that and the fact i dont have as much 
patience as id like fortunately theres also an upside my 
son is a genius he says 
infertility isnt the only reason doctors advise older women not 
to wait too long 
the incidence of downs syndrome 15 per thousand among women 
of 31 jumps to 1 in 350 at age 35 1 in 100 at age 40 and 1 in 30 
at age 45 
prenatal testing recommended for all women over 35 can now be 
done earlier and with less risk to the fetus the most common 
procedure is amniocentesis in which amniotic fluid is withdrawn by 
syringe from the uterus cells are isolated grown in a laboratory 
and analyzed to determine the number of chromosomes in the fetus 
an extra chromosome 21 indicates downs syndrome 
once performed 18 weeks into pregnancy amniocentesis can now be 
done at 13 or 14 weeks a pregnancy wont show before 20 weeks 
and the woman wont feel it before 1820 weeks so early amnio 
helps avoid a lot of issues says dr steven swersky a highrisk 
obstetrician in new york

the new england journal of medicine editorial stressed that the 
few pregnancyrelated problems more common among older women such 
as high blood pressure or diabetes are readily manageable in 
1990 
in the past such problems may have been overstated swersky 
says risks do go up but in some cases they go from 3 to 31 a 
lot depends on how its reported 
a lot also depends on whos being studied the mount sinai 
findings were based on private patients who were predominantly 
white married collegeeducated nonsmokers precisely the group 
most apt to delay childbearing 
the good news has yet to find its way into some doctors 
offices in todays medicallegal climate a woman of 39 can go 
in with a dream and come out feeling like a time bomb thats 
waiting to go off swersky says 
senior people in the field still have certain attitudes 
doctors have been bombarded with such negativism for so long 
attitudes are changing but slowly 
kate a 50yearold new york writer who asks that her last name 
not be used wanted natural delivery in a birthing room instead 
like more than 50 percent of pregnant women over 40 she wound up 
with a caesarean section 
such surgery is not always warranted doctors say 
youre taught that these are premium pregnancies so doctors 
tend to bail out and do csections sooner in these patients says 
dr john elliott of phoenix perinatal associates the nations 
largest private practice of highrisk obstetrics 
some physicians tell women just because theyre older that 
theyre fragile and need special handling that attitude really 
bothers me all of a sudden this woman who thought this was the 
neatest thing in the world has had all the fun taken out of it 
for some older women the fun is already diluted by anxiety 
particularly if shes had problems with infertility or previous 
miscarriages a woman may have tremendous fear of losing her 
baby says patricia schreinerengel associate professor of 
obgyn and reproductive science and psychiatry at mount sinai 
while many pregnant women worry about losing their babies older 
womens fears often are heightened by the likelihood they wont get 
another chance a situation that also can create anxious 
overprotective parents she says 
on a brighter note many older people see themselves as better 
parents and i think its true most of us would make better 
parents when were older and have less pressure in our lives 
women who come late to the baby business often find motherhood a 
great leveler my grooming is slipping there just isnt time 
packerwilliams says i used to look at mothers and say look at 
her why cant she get herself together now i know 
waltonvirta who lives in brooklyn ny spent her 20s and 30s 
living abroad and indulging her love of adventures so far raising 
olivia is on a par with the best of them she says 
all the normal things i associated with being a mother like 
little league pediatricians and station wagons i thought would 
disgust me i thought what a boring way to live i was wrong about 
what happens when you fall in love with a baby 
of course motherhood after 40 is not without tradeoffs 
an only child packerwilliams finds herself too busy to pay 
much attention to her own elderly mother and father im really 
caught in the aging parentbaby sandwich she says not to 
mention id like younger grandparents 
theres also ones own mortality to consider 
you do worry its a reality and you dont ignore it says 
neen hunt 49 head of the calhoun school in new york hunt the 
mother of evan 10 and richard 6 lost her own mother at 50 
weve talked about new moms and dads my kids are more attuned to 
that possibility 
polly hams brother and sister both died young her husband lost 
his mother when he was 14 there are moments when he has concerns 
about my being older she says but i have to trust the wisdom 
of the universe that somehow laurel came into my life at the right 
time she says her daughter is a great incentive to stay healthy 
classic comedy routines can take on new twists when hardbitten 
professionals meet dr spock 
unexpectedly pregnant at 42 sally anderson a college science 
textbook editor in new york didnt worry about telling her parents 
or husband childrens book illustrator fred winkowski 
she worried about telling her boss 
i had been so devoted to my job when i finally broke the 
news i had tears in my eyes and my upper lip was shaking would i 
be demoted would i lose my window office 
my boss said how did this happen i said i dont know 
and he said youre a biologist sally of course you know 
erik winkowski who has his mothers scandinavian cheekbones and 
straight silky hair turned 7 in june at an age when most women 
are spoiling their childrens children sally remains on the front 
lines of motherhood a 50yearold teenage mutant ninja turtle 
expert who speaks fluent nintendo 
hes such a treasure i think i look at him differently than i 
would have at 28 but its so arrogant to say so she says who 
am i to say that a 28yearold wouldnt love her child as much 
occasionally she caught herself doing mental arithmetic i 
told a friend just after erik was born that when erik is my age 
ill be almost 90 there was a brief pause then we both started 
laughing 
anderson has no regrets younger friends who left lowerlevel 
jobs to have babies found their career derailed she says being 
where i wanted to be in terms of my career has made a big 
difference 
by contrast kate has neither a stable career nor a husband to 
help support and rear 2yearold james the son she delivered at 
age 47 her partner a man in his 50s with grown children walked 
out when she refused to terminate the pregnancy she had thought 
they both wanted 
as a single parent kate finds it doubly hard being so out of 
sync with her peers a friends child is about to get married hers 
is learning to speak in complete sentences 
i read the books written for older mothers the ones that 
assume you have your life all pulled together and i just laugh i 
am so up against it financially im living from week to week 
last winter unable to afford child care she left her baby with 
her 82yearold parents in florida while she commuted to work in 
new york at one point i was away from him 2 weeks it was 
hell 
given the hardships is she sorry 
i thank the lord the stars the universe and all of the 
angels it is a miracle she says and im grateful

scores of correspondents have died on the battlefields 
including pyle in world war ii he covered the war for the 
scrippshoward newspaper alliance boyle who covered world war ii 
korea and vietnam for the associated press died in 1974 
arnett who covered vietnam for more than a decade for the 
associated press now is a correspondent with cnn based in 
jerusalem 
the old war correspondent has become extinct because old wars 
have become extinct says arnett just as you wont have grunts 
unshaven on the front line worrying about home and dug in for six 
months you dont need reporters there because youre not going to 
have them six months what has made the war correspondent of 
old sort of redundant is that the modern western wars are of very 
short duration like panama 
the panama invasion was basically reported by journalists 
permanently stationed in the area 
arnett was on the panama invasion within 24 hours the military 
pool was restricted by the time most of the correspondents got 
there basically the shooting was over even though we did go out 
with the troops there was nothing to cover grenada was the same 
way 
those thoughts stir different sorts of memories and i see my 
friend and colleague arnett dug in at the big vietnam battles on 
patrol alongside american troops marching along a foreboding dirt 
road in the rain and mud in harms way steel helmet protecting 
his head a poncho wrapped around his body 
or another sidekick dickey chapelle dressed in her jungle 
fatigues a bush hat hiding her hornrimmed glasses a field pack 
strapped to her back crammed with cameras film and a tape recorder 
one november day 25 years ago she challenged henri huet an ap 
photographer to a bet she wagered a dime that the marine unit she 
was with would be fired on before his 
she lost by half an hour when henris unit was pinned down by 
sniper fire okay she laughed tomorrow ill have my 
chance 
that night henri helped her dig her foxhole despite her 
protests night was coming on fast and a mortar attack was 
expected although it did not materialize 
the next morning she and henri shared a breakfast of crations 
then as she did almost every day she moved out with the marines 
to begin the days patrolling at the foot of the first hill they 
went down a boobytrapped viet cong grenade wired to a mortar tore 
through the patrol 
henri who had lingered in the rear to take other photos heard 
the cries corpsman corpsman with his heart racing he ran 
100 yards to where four bodies lay on the ground one face was down 
and soaked with blood henri couldnt tell who it was he moved 
closer 
it was dickey chapelle 
dickey chapelle 47 an accomplished pilot and parachutist 
veteran war correspondent and author she had covered world war ii 
and virtually every trouble spot since she was jailed by the 
communists during the hungarian revolution she bled to death on 
the floor of a helicopter as it carried her to a field hospital 
ironically henri huet would die six years later along with the 
fabled life photographer larry burrows and upi photo editor kent 
potter while covering a south vietnamese operation 
their helicopter was hit by north vietnamese fire and burst into 
a fireball the south vietnamese pilot either because of 
inexperience or disorientation flew over that same gun position 
not once but twice the second time they got him 
in world war ii korea and vietnam correspondents flew to the 
front in helicopters and rode to the battlefields in jeeps cars 
and even sampans in the mekong delta of vietnam in vietnam we 
hitchhiked back by land air and sea from the remote jungles and 
hills to our saigon headquarters to file our dispatches indeed 
television had to ship its film by air to tokyo hong kong or some 
other destination for relay to the united states 
there was of course no regular transportation i got many a 
ride by running up and down runways waving my arms at the pilots 
begging can you give me a lift to saigon 
the first was the toughest for me i found myself crouched in a 
bucket seat drained and exhausted boxed into a windowless c130 
cargo plane as it took off in the darkness in the freight 
compartment with me were perhaps 200 other americans 
but i was the only one alive all the others were wrapped in 
green plastic body bags slain that day in swamps and jungles half 
a world from home 
as the plane droned through the night skies i tried to keep my 
sanity by working on my notes but i soon was overwhelmed by the 
thought of the grief that would come when the families of these 
young men answered the dreaded knock on the door 
but there is the other and brighter side to the new situation of 
war coverage that we will not again mourn as frequently as we did 
in the past the deaths of journalistic comrades in arms or be the 
bearer of dreadful news to american families

nonetheless soviet officials say they are confident that 
samarkands stunning beauty and exotic flavor will draw more 
visitors than the city can handle 
even now the hotel samarkand fills to capacity during the balmy 
months of spring and fall intourist is building a large new luxury 
hotel nearby in a joint venture with indian investors 
each morning busloads of americans germans and japanese clog 
the mud lanes running past monuments that have astonished visitors 
for centuries 
ancient samarkand sits in moldering glory at the center of the 
modern soviet urban blur that spreads from its edges its main 
plaza is a dramatic square of arches and domes in rich colors 
tamarlane the master builder and tyrant lies blocks away under 
a gracefully shaped fluted cupola tiled in the deep blue and gold 
hues that were his trademark 
across town a complex of bluedomed mausoleums line a sunken 
alley 100 yards long each elaborately inlaid with ceramic mosaics 
semiprecious stones and hardwoods 
the old market sprawls from the magnificent ruins of the bibi 
khanum mosque to the outdoor teahouse where old men spend the day 
chatting and picking their toes 
many visitors find it as exciting to watch the people as the 
architecture 
men moslems and jews alike favor a whiteembroidered black 
square skullcap robe styles date back to the first draft of the 
bible but there are also calf ropers baseball caps faded 
designer jeans and mickey mouse tshirts 
most women dress to tradition in capelike shifts of cotton or 
silk in vivid patterns baggy pants reach below the ankles some 
women mostly russians venture out with low necklines and high 
hems 
all styles and colors blend in the market a dusty sprawl of 
ancient brick tin roofing and rickety stalls men doze at tables 
laden with spices women hawk fat red strawberries mysterious 
grains and the uzbeks distinctive wheels of tasty flat bread 
samarkand is rich in legendary hospitality on winding back 
streets families make room at dinner tables even wedding parties 
for tourists who stop to show interest 
in fact a smiling and gentle exterior masks ominous 
undercurrents which outsiders must probe to fathom 
newly established opposition parties such as a grassroots uzbek 
movement called birlik or unity agitate for sovereignty and a 
return to asian roots some organizations go further 
we are many and we are growing confided one dissident a 
tadzhik entrepreneur who agreed to speak anonymously only after 
cautious introductions he described underground groups which seek 
a total break with moscow 
lithuania is a textbook and we are reading it carefully he 
said but unlike the baltic states he added uzbekistan had a high 
potential for sustained violence 
his own group is dominated by tadzhiks who argue that since they 
built samarkand soviet planners should have put it in 
tadzhikistan not uzbekistan and it is never too late to change 
as long as samarkand is only a potential powder keg officials 
continue to push its strong points and hope for the best kgb 
agents with less to do than in moscow remain on the alert 
oh no we have no problems here assured the concierge at 
the hotel samarkand when asked about ethnic relations i am an 
armenian and i have lived here all my life no problems 
then she vanished into a back room before the next question

editors note gerald celente is a professional trend tracker 
helping his clients develop products services and advertising 
strategies for profit in an everchanging world hes also playing 
his own hunch to cash in on growing concern about the environment 
hes created enviroman predicting that he could be americas next 
animated superhero

late at night on the outskirts of 
homesville a truck pulls to the side of the road two men begin 
unloading barrels of chemical waste in the shadows 
a second vehicle speeds to the scene a sporty solarpowered 
little number with all of the power but none of the roar of its 
fossil fuelburning counterparts 
out steps a futuristically clad man with paul newman blue eyes 
a clint eastwood jaw and patrick swayze hair he saunters over to 
the men as they drain toxic fluid into a nearby creek 
sensing the figure behind them they turn around recognition 
glazes their eyes with fear the men know their illegal dumping 
days are over theyve just come face to face with enviroman 
the animated superhero of the future just maybe gerald 
celente the creator of enviroman has a hunch that the 
evilthwarting heroics of enviroman will surpass those of superman 
and the teenage mutant ninja turtles in the imagination of the 
younger set 
just what is it that makes celente think his enviroman will join 
the ranks of the great american heroes 
trends 
celente tracks them the 43yearold rhinebeck man is the author 
of trend tracking a 300page guide to translating trends into 
strategies products and ultimately profit 
celente identifies a trend as a definite predictable direction 
or sequence of events like the warming of the earths climate 
the idea according to celente is to keep looking at all the 
different trends that are going on out there and see how your 
product could fit in 
enviroman for example 
when it comes to speed this heros no match for a speeding 
bullet and hes not nearly as powerful as a locomotive in fact 
if the decidedly human enviroman has his way hell never even 
throw a punch 
thats because celentes research has shown that right now 
americans are concerned about the state of the planet global 
warming and the destruction of the ozone hes also tracked a 
reversal of public support for defense spending which has given 
way to a growing interest in disarmament and peace 
so enviroman protects the planet but without the benefit of an 
arsenal of weapons packed into a batbelt nor the obvious 
advantage of being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound 
instead hes a martial arts expert 
enviromans not a superhero says celente who created the 
animated crime fighter now under consideration by king features 
syndicate for a multimedia series hes human because real 
people have to solve the problems instead of fighting hostile 
aliens he fights criminals against the environment 
also through research celente found a trend among young boys 
toward acoustic instruments so enviroman was given a sax and 
placed in a band which takes him all over the world 
to capture the fancy of young females partial to the 
environmental cause enviroman was also given rugged good looks 
crossing trends and developing products and advertising 
strategies is the basis of celentes work as director of the 
socioeconomic research institute of america based in rhinebeck 
the firm is a consortium of 25 experts from fields including 
economics education engineering banking and psychology 
celente and other members of the institute work from their 
homes which are scattered throughout the country researchers 
communicate with each other via computers and fax machines 
the institute teaches its clients how to manage trends celente 
says and how to translate them into products and services 
those clients are involved in banking the food industry 
product development and other areas he says citing 
confidentiality celente wont disclose the names of the companies 
which employ him 
celeste founded the institute in 1980 it was an idea born in 
the 70s during the bronx natives tenure as a government affairs 
specialist 
id read things file information crossreference and i 
realized everythings connected celente says its all one 
system 
he calls the institutes method of integrating data from 
multiple fields globalnomics 
the key to our system is making connections between seemingly 
unrelated fields celente says by looking at trends and tying 
things together you can anticipate changes and profit from them 
so who can profit from trends according to trend tracking 
anyone with enough common sense to position himself for them and 
to make it easier trend tracking concludes with an a to z 
directory of profit opportunities leafing through it is a little 
like gazing into celentes crystal ball 
air conditioners demand for air conditioners will grow as the 
earth gets warmer says trend tracking because of the 
chlorofluorocarbon the old 
cordoba now dubbed piggies has made a confusing economy even 
more so i have to think twice before going out to buy 
anything says a middleclass housewife and not just because 
everything is so expensive its the conversions back and forth 
they give me a headache

over the summer while nbcs grand was 
being revamped bonnie hunt spent her time off working in a 
hospital 
its better than going to acting school she says if you 
havent had a lot of experience it can be difficult to portray 
people in everyday situations 
hunt went back home to chicago to work as a nurse her career 
before she became a standup comedian and actress 
i was a volunteer nurse in the veterans hospital in chicago 
she says i also worked at a nursing home for a while i was 
really just doing it for myself i enjoy working with the patients 
its my favorite thing in the whole world 
meanwhile her comedy series which made its debut last january 
is being changed to emphasize the class and economic differences 
between hunts carol anne smithson and pamela reeds janice 
pasetti some cast members will go including michael mckean who 
played hunts husband 
in the show carol anne is the niece of the town patriarch 
played by john randolph janice a single mother living in a 
trailer park works as their housekeeper this season carol anne 
and janice will live in the same house 
i dont know what they have planned for us hunt says i 
think my husband will just disappear i think if he died carol anne 
would be affected for a long time when we started the show carol 
anne was so in love with her husband in the pilot she wanted a 
child and wanted sex all the time but i couldnt play that level 
all the time i wanted to play someone people could identify with 
shes going to miss her husband she wanted to be loved and 
approved shes a woman who defines herself by the man shes with 
she looks at janice and thinks shes so worldly janice looks at 
her and thinks she has money you look at people and apply your own 
values and ideas to them 
when shes not working hunt lives in chicago with her husband 
john murphy 
my husband calls me lucy and himself ricky ricardo he works 
at a bank and every year we go to the bosss home for dinner last 
year it was a pool party my body has never seen the sun so i 
stayed in jeans this year i broke the door handle off his boss 
new porsche 
i came from such a traditional family my father was ralph 
kramden when i was in the sixthgrade i taped johnny carson 
interviewing joey bishop i put in my voice for joey bishops and 
gave it to my father for fathers day he was so tickled hed call 
up people and play it over the telephone 
although she wanted to go into comedy her father insisted she 
have another profession he died while she was still in nursing 
school 
i loved my dad so much she says so many fathers in my 
neighborhood died young my parents talked to us about our lives 
and led very exemplary lives he was an electrician supervisor for 
the board of education every christmas hed divide up his paycheck 
among his men hed come home and say he didnt get paid 
her mother alice hunt a former singer works in administration 
at shriners hospital in chicago she played the organ and piano 
every day when we were growing up hunt says i used to say 
when she woke up in the morning there were little birds singing 
over her head 
while working in a cancer ward during the day hunt entered the 
acting profession doing improvisational comedy at night her 
patients kept scrapbooks of her reviews she later became a member 
of second city 
hunt had just left the second city troupe in santa monica and 
taken a job in a yogurt store when she auditioned for grand 
at the audition i changed a few words to make it sound more 
natural she says usually writers dont like it but michael 
leeson told me to improvise 
she paused i never did start my job at the yogurt store 
before grand hunt was probably best known as the waitress 
in rain man the one who dropped the toothpicks

suggested retail price rated r 
the men and women who police the police are the lowest of the 
low to their fellow officers pariahs scum hitlers in blue but 
the feeling is more than mutual 
in mike figgis internal affairs the clash of wills and 
collision of ethics come barreling to a bloody and shattering 
conclusion for detective raymond avila and dennis peck the 
celebrated street cop he brings down 
avila andy garcia is a methodical and eager cop who gets 
promoted to the internal affairs division of the los angeles 
police he believes in his job and he believes in the law his 
partner amy laurie metcalf is a careful investigator who goes 
by the book and who understands that all their job means is a shot 
at becoming a lieutenant 
a routine investigation of excessive violence in an arrest by 
another police officer leads the pair to suspect peck of being the 
mastermind behind a complicated network of crime ranging from 
murder to extortion to prostitution to money laundering and fraud 
peck richard gere is a master manipulator who knows what 
buttons to push to get a desired reaction from people and thus set 
plans to his liking hes also a loathesome misogynist and racist 
he and avila lock horns and peck finding avilas achilles 
heel plays a psychological game that involves avilas wife 
kathleen nancy travis 
after a memorable bit in the untouchables as the fed who 
lines up a killing shot while stretched out at an impossible angle 
on a staircase and teaming with michael douglas as a cop in 
black rain garcia has landed his first starring role but 
theres more to this actor than cop roles his smoldering good 
looks quiet manner and intensity hold promise for greater things 
to come 
hes convincing as avila revealing his hot latin passions 
vulnerabilities and quiet pursuit of the law less convincing is 
gere who gives a onenote performance that erupts at the end in 
almost comic book frenzy 
figgis uneven pacing and reliance on blood and guts makes this 
a difficult movie to watch on the home screen

heart condition rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 8995 
rated r 
is racism the stuff that comedy is made of can bigotry get a 
laugh or two as writer and director james d parriott has 
borrowed freely from the hollywood movie mill to craft his film 
about a heart transplant sex drugs and politics a coverup and 
murder and the improbable relationship between a black ghost and a 
bigoted white cop 
unfortunately parriott whose work has been limited to 
televison six million dollar man island sons from here 
to eternity brings a tv mentality to heart condition with 
quickfix sight gags and jokes you can almost imagine a laugh 
track 
he has all the standard characters a prostitute with a heart of 
gold a classy lawyer who works for gangsters a seedy and bigoted 
vice cop a slick pimp a police captain who spends most of his 
time playing golf 
theres also the standard story line a highpowered senator 
dies while having sex and drugs with two hookers theres a 
coverup and the silencing of those who knew or might have known 
and who is to solve the dastardly deed the seedy bigoted vice cop 
with a brand new heart 
napoleon stone denzel washington is a successful lawyer whose 
clients include highclass hookers including crystal chloe webb 
the former girlfriend of vice cop jack moony bob hoskins 
crystal a camera fanatic snapped pictures during the lustdrug 
romp with the senator and gave the film to moony for safe keeping 
the senators death is listed as a heart attack and the two hookers 
are under the watchful eye of the pimp who arranged the date 
certain washington politicos think crystal might have told her 
lawyer about the incident so they kill him 
meanwhile moony a lover of junk food fat and liquor has a 
heart attack and will die unless given a new heart he gets stones 
heart he also gets stones ghost a dapper gent who has a change 
of clothes in just about every scene 
where have we seen all of this before lets see the heart 
transplant recalls that raymond st jacquesleslie nielsen 
blaxploitation flick a change of mind in which a white 
district attorneys brain is transplanted into a black mans body 
the ghost part is easy all those wonderful topper movies 
with roland young only heart condition lacks the unspoiled 
sophistication of the kirbys ghostly existence as for the sleazy 
white copblack man buddy movie theres 48 hrs with nick 
nolte and eddie murphy 
there are some fun moments though moony walking along with his 
arm around the ghosts shoulder getting puzzled looks from 
passersby theres also a funny bit when stone tries to stop moony 
from eating a hamburger dripping with grease and cheese the scene 
has hoskins wrestling a hamburger to the ground before stunned 
lunchers shades of roger rabbit 
after a while moony actually starts to like stone gets the bad 
guys wins back crystal and helps her raise the baby she and stone 
had unfortunately this could be the perfect setup for a sequel 
hoskins and washington are both topflight actors who are 
versatile enough to handle high drama washington in glory and 
a soldiers story hoskins in mona lisa and a prayer for 
the dying as well as comedy washington in carbon copy and 
hoskins in who framed roger rabbit they handle the script and 
the story with grace there also are excellent support performances 
by webb and roger e mosley as capt wendt 
in heart condition the laughs are indeed there but there 
are also too many slow pockets and the movie is also just a tad 
too derivative 
still its not a bad diversion for a lazy friday night vidfest

music of grainger koechlin piston walton and diepenbrock 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when a new recording technology such as the compact disc 
matures the listener benefits 
such major labels as sony classical may keep churning out 
warhorse pieces by warhorse performers and rising stars making a 
name 
even the usually admirable telarc can perpetrate something as 
shameful as a best of beethoven as it did recently in a cd 
consisting of movements from various beethoven works in its catalog 
but smaller companies and lately some of the conglomerates can 
turn to other things reissues of historical performances by 
legendary artists on discs with improved sound or cds of music by 
the lesser known composer even the historical nonentity which 
broaden our knowledge and open us up to new delights 
the latter category is examined here 
quick name a famous dutch composer maybe sweelinck comes to 
mind but since his lifetime 15621621 the netherlands has not 
had many composers of international renown until alphons 
diepenbrock who died at the age of 68 in 1921 a selftaught 
follower of wagner he was influenced by late beethoven and 
debussy diepenbrock had a literary bent and was a trained 
classicist 
its not surprising then that a recent chandos disc devoted to 
him includes his overture to aristophanes play the birds the 
marsyas concert suite based on greek mythology and the elektra 
symphonic suite included is the hymn for violin and orchestra 
diepenbrocks appealing music is dramatic and extroverted he 
uses leitmotifs short recurring musical themes and shows a 
strong grasp of orchestral colors the residentie orchestra of the 
hague conducted by hans vonk performs convincingly emmy verhey 
is the able soloist 
also in the dramatic vein is the same companys first volume of 
sir william waltons film music on a disc full of sirs sir neville 
marriner conducts the academy of st martin in the fields with sir 
john gielgud narrating sir laurence oliviers hamlet also on 
the disc is the music to as you like it 
like practically all film music one hears traces of stravinsky 
and wagner and like all really good film music one wants to see 
the movie while listening to it 
the project is worthy and makes good music accessible the 
various sections are well woven together by christopher palmer 
gielgud as to be expected reads portions of the text as a 
knight of the theater unfortunately his aged voice sounds 
completely inappropriate for hamlet but thats fine if the words 
are listened to for their music 
another composer of film music was the neglected french composer 
charles koechlin 18671950 who turned to the form late in a life 
that produced more than 200 works 
the west german label audite has released a disc of koechlins 
oboe works played by lajos lencses 
the pieces are introspective yet not intimate composed in a 
delicate and sometimes meandering style lencses is a graceful 
fullbodied oboist with a tendency to sound monochromatic 
koch international classics has released a disc of percy 
grainger orchestral pieces played by the melbourne symphony 
orchestra conducted by geoffrey simon 
the melbourneborn grainger 18821961 was friends with delius 
and grieg trained in germany and lived most of his life in the 
united states 
his chief characteristic amply displayed on this disc lies in 
a propensity to use folk tunes which can sound irritating in big 
orchestral treatments its a particular taste the recorded sound 
is slightly murky and the orchestra a little bland 
walter piston uses another kind of indigenous music jazz in 
his works though more artfully so one of the great american 
composers piston 18941976 is a master of orchestral color 
whose symphonic music bubbles with syncopated energy 
gerard schwarz conducting the new york chamber symphony and 
seattle symphony brings an intensity and compactness of sound to 
the second and sixth symphonies and sinfonietta on an excellent 
delos recording

it is a dream of millions of children 
everywhere the dream of finding a hidden treasure it came true 
50 years ago for four french youngsters who discovered what turned 
out to be the cradle of world art 
with its magnificent murals created more than 17000 years ago 
the lascaux cave near this dordogne town is rated by experts to 
contain the worlds finest and best preserved display of 
prehistoric draftsmanship 
hundreds of thousands have admired the vivid colors of its 
paintings and the clarity of their lines but mass pilgrimages to 
the hillside cave in southwest france brought them to the verge of 
destruction forcing its closing in 1963 
a team of scientists using modern technology repaired the damage 
and restored the former environmental conditions inside the cave 
and thus ensured survival of mankinds earliest masterpieces 
art was hardly on the minds of the four boys who were between 
15 and 18 when took a day off from school on sept 12 1940 and 
roamed the dense forest above the vezere river legend had it there 
was a secret underground passage extending into the hill from a 
little chateau at its foot 
like all children we thought of course that a treasure was 
hidden there simon coencas the youngest of the four recalled 
in an interview with the associated press that day three of us 
were again in the forest then a fourth buddy marcel ravidat 
showed up 
i think i have discovered the underground passage he told 
us there is a hole in the ground and i think thats it 
the hole was barely 80 centimeters 26 feet wide and deep but 
pebbles the boys dropped through a small opening at the bottom 
indicated it went deeper 
so we made the hole wider continued coencas now 65 and an 
industrialist living near paris but no one wanted to go down 
first except marcel the oldest and a real daredevil we followed 
after he shouted that he was in a cave 
they landed right in the main cavern which has since became 
known as the hall of the bulls for the huge red brown and 
black paintings of bisons that dominate the murals the boys were 
awestruck by what they saw on the white limestone walls in the 
flicker of their petroleum lamp 
it was marvellous coencas recalled something one had 
never seen it was like a dream we decided to return the next day 
to explore the cave more closely and keep our find secret but then 
we thought we should tell at least our schoolteacher about it 
at first he thought we were joking but when we took him there 
and had a look he immediately informed the authorities 
for days the boys continued a vigil at their cave until the 
arrival of henri breuil a catholic priest with a worldwide 
reputation for his archaeological studies 
my god he is said to have exclaimed this is a 
prehistoric sistine chapel he marveled at the exciting color 
combinations created with simple materials such as ocher iron 
oxides and carbon mixed with animal fat bone marrow or blood 
breuil swiftly authenticated the paintings and engravings and 
three months later the cave was declared a national monument 
it took him years to compile an inventory of the more than 1000 
paintings drawings and engravings of bisons horses stags hinds 
ibexes and other animals often pierced by arrows or lances 
one puzzling mural depicts a mortally wounded bison seemingly 
butting a fallen nude male hunter a pole topped by a birds head 
is also part of the scene scientists say the cave was never 
inhabited but must have served as a center for magic rites designed 
to induce success in hunting 
lascaux was discovered by the tourist industry following its 
opening to the public in 1948 it became a popular destination for 
travelers from all over the world visitors reached a peak of 
125000 in 1962 
but green spots on the frescoes caused increasing alarm among 
archaeologists algae mosses ferns began spreading rapidly over 
the murals in addition calcite began veiling the art 
exposure to changes in temperatures caused by body heat to 
carbon dioxide and moisture from large groups threatened to efface 
within decades what had survived for millenniums the cave was 
closed to the general public on april 2 1963 and a team of 40 
specialists began the salvage operations 
the inside was sprayed with antibiotics and the walls were 
treated with formaldehyde solutions after two years all 
aggressive microorganisms were destroyed stopping the formation of 
calcite by close climatic controls took longer 
the cave has recovered said jeanphilippe rigaud director 
of the bordeauxbased prehistoric antiquities office who is in 
charge of all caves in the aquitaine region but to keep it in 
good health we have to apply strict rules for its protection 
the temperature inside is kept at a constant 125 celsius 545 
fahrenheit more than 50 control instruments also measure air 
pressure and humidity and warn of other changes affecting the 
natural balance that existed in the 150yardlong cave before its 
discovery 
rigaud said carbondating of remnants found in the cave 
suggested the murals were created about 17500 years ago but he 
said a recent study suggests that the method may not be completely 
reliable and that lascaux may be even a bit older 
since 1963 access to the cave is limited to five visitors a day 
on five days per week chiefly scientists and other holders of 
special passes their shoes are treated with an antibacterial 
liquid so there is no relapse of the biological threat 
international demand for passes is so heavy that handling 
correspondence is a fulltime job for one of rigauds staffers 
some scientists apply two years in advance to be sure to get a date 
increasing that number is absolutely ruled out rigaud said 
we could not take such a risk and everybody has accepted this 
the danger from mass tourism also forced authorities to seal off 
the cave of altamira in northwest spain which comes close to 
lascaux in artistic splendor 
admission to the third most important center of prehistoric art 
the grotto of niaux in frances pyrenees region was limited to 
220 a day three years ago although its vast system of galleries 
makes it less vulnerable 
at lascaux a replica of the main cavern constructed about 200 
meters from the original has become a new tourist attraction since 
its completion in 1983 up to 2000 visitors a day admire the 
reproduction of the hall of the bulls 
its a good thing rigaud said it gives quite a precise 
idea of what they would see in the original 
does he think that lascaux will remain the last important 
prehistoric discovery 
we could find a cave comparable to lascaux even tomorrow 
rigaud said to achieve such quality in lascaux the artists 
must have at first practiced in other caves with other pictures 
either those caves were completely wiped out by erosion or the 
caves have not yet been discovered

jane wiedlins group consciousness started at 
age 10 in church 
i was raised catholic but we went to this sort of hippy 
catholic church explained wiedlin the former gogo who has 
released her third solo album tangled 
the preacher was this young hip cute priest we had this 
church band i was in wed sing the popular songs of the time wed 
sing leaving on a jet plane in church we got away with bloody 
murder 
that environment sort of nurtured people to be socially aware 
and to try and be a good person that group of people was trying to 
live out the christian ethic trying to help other people 
shes craved community ever since as a punk in hollywood as 
rhythm guitarist for the gogos and as an active member of the 
animal rights movement but she also takes time off to be alone to 
write songs about peace and love and consider the challenge of 
making happy music in a sad world 
i am somewhere in the middle she said dressed cheerfully 
at the emi records office in a purple sweatshirt and purple shorts 
a purple headband wrapped around her jet black hair 
i can really start thinking too much about everything but on 
the other hand you cant give up you got to keep trying i think 
life is full of small little joys that you have to grab onto 
happiness is offered in threeminute bites on tangled this 
is ear candy but bittersweet with fears of the future hidden 
under sunny harmonies in flowers on the battlefield she 
worries innocence gets crushed beneath the anger and desire and 
everything thats pure and good gets caught in the crossfire 
i wanted to write a song about war and not be so specific so 
that thats all it could be about she said i wanted it to be 
on all different levels in war and relationships in general 
its not just the battlers that get hurt but the innocent 
victims as well im kind of on the outside looking at the 
situation i was thinking more about children really the picture 
in my head was of war and think of what gets decimated in the war 
of soldiers and children and animals 
with the gogos wiedlin was right in the middle the one who 
left the band first and helped speed its breakup in 1985 she met 
the other members belinda carlisle charlotte caffey gina schock 
and kathy valentine in the late 1970s in the hollywood punk 
clubs where wiedlin hung out as a teenager 
the gogos like the beach boys in the 1960s presented fun as 
a way of life we got the beat set the tone a snappy update of 
the beach boys i get around that captured the attitude of five 
young women who wrote their own songs and played their own 
instruments 
but the breakup in 1985 was a nasty affair with namecalling and 
fingerpointing and rumors of drugs and emotional problems 
briefly wiedlin recalls she was glad to get away 
first there was the whole relief that everybody elses 
problems werent my problems anymore she said i had to deal 
with emotional problems with four people who were worse off than i 
was basically 
on my first solo album jane wiedlin i had a song called 
traveling heart which was about feeling disloyal and i was 
writing about it because i was in love with two different men 
but in the end the song was about leaving the gogos 
because i had terrible guilt feelings about leaving the band talk 
about leaving a deserting ship i really felt like a rat 
tangled is a good way of summing up her solo career jane 
wiedlin which included a song called one hundred years of 
solitude sold poorly her next record fur quickly produced 
a hit single inside a dream but was forgotten after the next 
single flopped 
they just of dropped the whole project goodbye jane wiedlin 
until the next record she said of her record company it was 
horrible at the time i talked to them about it probably a thousand 
times 
i try and be nice about it but shoot it not only hurt my 
feelings it hurt my career i need some support this time i know 
everybody feels stupid and bad about that record 
meanwhile group consciousness has caught up with her again 
shes patched things up with the other gogos and a november 
reunion tour is planned 
wiedlins married now and says a part of her really has settled 
down and adjusted to being on her own but still theres something 
about walking into a room and finding it filled with all these 
people 
i started missing the camaraderie and support system of being 
in a band i walked into the rehearsals straight off a plane 
having spent four nights on my own with this album in england 
she said 
they had already been in rehearsals for a week and i was so 
panicked about being a gogo again and doing all these songs but 
it felt comfortable and within minutes everybody was coming up 
with jokes that we used to crack up at

theres no question older people are a golden 
market for all kinds of businesses and the senior citizen 
discounts that seem to be everywhere have been increasing but some 
experts predict their demise 
the florida restaurant association found 25 percent of its 
members offer senior discounts up from 20 percent in 1988 
spokesman robert nelson said 
but the restaurants are turning even more quickly to earlybird 
specials hoping to attract the same clientele by differentiating 
dining hours rather than age 
the percentage of members offering earlybird specials went from 
17 percent in 1988 to 52 percent this year nelson said 
the perception is that these are skinflints out there looking 
for the lowest possible dollar said ralph gasparello head of 
the national association of senior travel planners based in 
hingham mass that might have been the case but i think now 
youve got a whole new group coming up the ladder 
the 1570inn choice hotels international which runs clarion 
hotels and quality comfort rodeway and sleep inns has focused on 
the senior market for four years 
when we did our research we found that there was a lot of 
other things besides discounts that seniors wanted said 
marketing director bill todd three words consistency 
credibility and reliability 
the chain reserved firstfloor and nonsmoking rooms in part of 
its effort to appeal to seniors and business in its senior saver 
discount program went up 716 percent in the year ending in june 
todd said 
royal cruise lines based in san francisco was the first in its 
industry to associate with the american heart association to 
develop a healthconscious menu and it offers lecture programs on 
some cruises to target older vacationers jeff ostroff author of 
the book successful marketing to the 50 plus consumer found 
in his research 
margaret lynne duggar vice chairwoman of the florida pepper 
commission on aging and a consultant on targeting older markets 
sees businesses moving away from straight discounts in the 1990s 
across the nation it seems logical that the older consumer 
will become such a large proportion of the buying public that 
offering discounts mainly based on age will not be a viable option 
for business in the future she said 
the benefit of a pricing program like that disappears if 
everybodys doing it said greg gable of age wave inc in 
emeryville calif an information service company focusing on 
older customers companies are starting to look at how to go a 
step further 
with the poverty level among seniors at about 13 percent value 
often is more important to older americans than price 
millions of people are willing to spend the 50 cents more if 
they think theyre going to get the good product the good service 
the good experience ostroff said thats a mindset thats less 
likely to be found in a 21yearold than in a 51yearold 
an age standard also can be a problem drawing resentment from 
seniors who feel its demeaning to be singled out by age and 
generating age discrimination charges by those left out 
peter levine of plantation fla filed a complaint with the 
broward county human relations division over a camps bank checking 
account reserved for people 55 and over 
he rejected a settlement that would have classified him as an 
honorary senior to get the account its unconscionable its 
like welfare for the rich he said 
ostroff says a discount is a nocost quick fix that doesnt 
require any investment of time or money and doesnt build brand or 
name loyalty 
i dont have any problem with marketing programs that are 
designed to attract regardless of age he said i really have a 
problem with the ageist one i really think its age discrimination 
and reverse discrimination

a law under consideration in washington state 
would give dying people more power to end their lives with the help 
of their physicians who could not be tried for murder for 
assisting suicides 
proponents of the initiative say it has been buoyed by the 
publicity surrounding the case of a michigan doctor who may be 
charged with murder for providing a sick woman with the means to 
kill herself 
just let her go peacefully pleaded mildred scherneck in 
tears as she thought of her hospitalized 97yearold mother it 
isnt that i want to lose her but when a person gets like she is 
they shouldnt let her live 
scherneck had just signed a citizens initiative known as the 
death with dignity initiative which would be the first legalizing 
assisted suicide 
more than 104000 people statewide have signed initiative 119 
since the campaign began may 3 organizers have until dec 31 to 
gather 150001 valid signatures to get the initiative on the 1991 
ballot if the legislature doesnt approve it first 
we are very confident that we will make it said karen 
cooper the initiatives campaign coordinator we are finding 
that clearly the citizens of washington are ready for this law 
if youre in sound mind you should be able to make that 
decision to die i think its our godgiven right said muriel 
boyd who signed the petition because she had to watch her father 
die painfully of cancer 11 years ago 
the initiative would amend the states 1979 natural death act to 
expand a terminally ill but mentally competent adults right to die 
it defines a terminal condition as one in which two 
physicians say in writing that a patient has no more than six 
months to live or is in an irreversible coma or a persistent 
vegetative state 
it would redefine lifesustaining measures to include 
artificial hydration and nutrition 
it adds a unique aidindying provision defined as a medical 
service provided in person by a physician that will end the life of 
a conscious and mentally competent qualified patient in a 
dignified painless and humane manner when requested voluntarily 
by the patient through a written directive executed at the time the 
medical service is desired 
at no time could aidindying be administered at the request of 
anyone other than the patient 
cooper said the publicity surrounding the assisted suicide of 
janet adkins in michigan helped the initiatives cause although 
the initiative would not have applied to adkins case 
adkins a portland ore resident who had been diagnosed last 
year with alzheimers disease killed herself outside detroit on 
june 4 by using a suicide machine built by dr jack kevorkian the 
machine injects a chemical that induces coma followed by another 
chemical that causes death 
kevorkian has been barred by a michigan court from using the 
machine while prosecutors decide whether they will try him 
however last month authorities in michigan charged a california 
man with murder for allegedly helping his cancerstricken wife die 
at a motel a hemlock society spokesman said the family flew to 
michigan after learning of the adkins case 
cooper said adkins would not have qualified for aidindying 
under the measure because she was not terminally ill by its 
definition 
this initiative does not in any way address or solve a lot of 
problems in the world it addresses the needs of two groups of 
patients individuals in permanent vegetative state and with no 
chance of recovery and those who are terminally ill who are 
mentally competent to make those decisions she said 
the eugene orebased national hemlock society a leading 
righttodie group is one of the main backers of the initiative 
which has been endorsed by the states democratic party 
the initiative has been condemned by the roman catholic church 
and the republican party platform is against the initiative 
asking doctors to kill undermines the moral integrity and 
confidence in a profession that heals comforts and protects 
life archbishop raymond hunthausen and coadjutor archbishop 
thomas murphy of seattle said in a statement issued as the 
initiative campaign began 
the seattlebased law firm perkins coie which conducted a 
limited review of the measure concluded it would hold up in court 
for physicians assisting suicides under the specified conditions 
the measure states that anyone forging or concealing revocation 
of an aidindying directive could be charged with firstdegree 
murder 
in 1988 californians tried to get a similar initiative on the 
ballot and failed fresh attempts are being made in california 
oregon and florida organizers said 
initiative 119 is an initiative to the legislature the 
legislature could pass it into law or propose an alternative in 
which case the original initiative and the alternate would go on 
the 1991 ballot if the legislature did nothing the initiative 
would automatically go on the 1991 ballot

the waitresses at fishers restaurant 
balance heaping plates of food on their arms and weave through 
dozens of tables to provide fast service to their customers 
pretty routine for a busy restaurant on a large boulevard in 
philadelphia what is unusual is that many of those efficient 
servers are eligible for retirement benefits 
of the restaurants 16 floor people more than half are 65 
or older with many averaging more than 20 years at fishers 
some cant perform at the levels they did years ago others need 
to sit and rest more often and schedules are juggled to handle 
doctor visits 
owner miles fisher jr wouldnt have it any other way 
after so many years its not fair to say youre retired 
now so i made it a policy that as long as a person wanted to 
work id try to accommodate them he said 
the workers know the rules you slow up miles gives you what 
you can handle said hostess marcia orlando hed never fire 
you because you got too old to handle a full shift maybe hell 
only give you two tables 
pantry worker muriel zappile 65 is a good example orlando 
said shes got bad legs so we let her go as she can six or 
seven hours then she goes rest 
or 76yearold eleanor creech who is on sick leave after 
doctors replaced her arthritic leg with an artificial one 
she just came in to pick up some back pay orlando said 
shes hobbling around and cant wait to get back to work 
creech has put in 25 years at the restaurant and can have as 
many more years as she wants fisher said if she cant wait on 
tables shell answer phones or help prepare menus 
dorothy saybolt an 18year veteran went to fisher with a 
different problem the 66yearold could work only so many hours 
before the government would cut her social security benefits 
now i only work 18 to 20 hours a week he lets me go home 
then she said 
several older workers came to the restaurant in recent years 
grateful that someone would give them work 
pat dolan worked at a luncheonette for years before the pace 
became too much in the early 1980s her employers told her that if 
she couldnt handle the job she should look elsewhere 
busboy paul irlan 61 had been a painter for many years but 
the work became too exhausting and he began looking for a less 
strenuous job 
interviews almost broke his spirit i lost some jobs to 
younger guys he said 
when i came here for a job i walked in and saw two young guys 
applying so i just turned to leave i figured there was no way 
theyd hire me 
fisher saw irlan leaving and caught up with him at the door 
he said you might be what i need so i gave it a try irlan 
said 
hes great orlando said we hired a young guy at the same 
time but paul ran circles around him 
fisher said rearranging schedules is worth the effort because 
older workers tend to be more reliable 
they become used to what the job is so the devotion to the 
job is higher he said they know the operation and can jump in 
anywhere they are needed 
other companies are coming around to the same attitude 
overall 153000 pennsylvania residents over 65 were working as 
of 1988 the latest figures available said john velis of the us 
bureau of labor he said an additional 3000 senior citizens of the 
states 176 million over65 population were jobhunting 
the waitresses at fishers say growing up during the great 
depression has given them a dedication to work that young people 
just dont have 
students from nearby temple university apply at fishers 
regularly but few stay longer than a month 
the young girls cant come in and work like we do said 
70yearold mary bear who came to fishers in 1943 they like 
money but they dont want to work

for millions of americans the onset of 
alzheimers disease opens a frustrating and sometimes fruitless 
search for longterm care and services a congressional agency 
reports 
congress office of technology assessment concludes that as 
americas population ages a nationwide system is urgently needed 
to link people with the debilitating disease with services they 
need and can afford 
the report confused minds burdened families finding help 
for people with alzheimers and other dementias estimates about 
18 million people in the united states have dementia so severe 
that others must care for them continually 
an additional 1 million to 5 million have mild or moderate 
dementia 
alzheimers and other forms of dementia progressively destroy 
memory and a persons ability to deal with and understand events 
and people to accomplish routine household chores or even to take 
care of oneself 
the report noted that many people eventually require total care 
24 hours a day for the rest of their lives 
and that poses a problem for the families who must care for them 
the congressional study quoted a wisconsin alzheimers task 
force as reporting 
alzheimers family members often tell distressing stories 
about not knowing where to go for help going from one service 
provider to another in a vain search for assistance and being 
misinformed about the availability of services or eligibility for 
programs 
families dont even know what to ask for and many go through a 
maze of blind alleys before help is obtained an adult day care 
provider told the maryland task force 
the congressional agency concluded that while the need to 
develop an effective system to link those suffering from 
alzheimers to the services they need may seem removed from the 
ravages of the disease itself it is far from an abstract concern 
calling existing services complex and fragmented the report 
said 
the need for such a system comes alive for people who try to 
find appropriate services for a relative or friend and 
confront the existing lack of accurate information about services 
and the often bewildering array of public and private agencies 
individuals funding sources eligibility criteria rules and 
regulations that constitute the service environment 
it said establishing such a system will be difficult because of 
the competing web of service providers 
but it said that without such a system many people simply will 
not get the care they need 
and families and others who already must bear the physical 
and emotional demands of caregiving will continue to experience 
the frustration of not being able to obtain accurate information 
and assistance in locating and arranging services it said 
the agency said any linking system should include education an 
information and referral network outreach efforts and case 
management and recommended it have these other characteristics 
be easily identifiable nationwide by using a common name or 
logo or telephone number 
be available throughout a patients illness 
be able to help care givers who live a distance from the 
patient 
make available full information about available services and 
sources of financing 
sen brock adams dwash chairman of the senate subcommittee 
on aging said the report underscores the heroic yet staggering 
burdens facing care givers 
he noted congress will consider adjustments in the older 
americans act next year and said that presents an opportunity to 
address the problem 
families shouldnt have to go begging for help in caring for 
loved ones with alzheimers disease said sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio chairman of the senate labor and human resources committee 
this report shows we must redouble our efforts to fill the gaps 
in our health care system

fernando carrillo vows he will never end up 
in a nursing home 
families should live together said the 78yearold retired 
military man who shares an apartment in the spanish capital with 
his 46yearold daughter it must be sad to have your kids send 
you off to live in exile in a place like that 
carrillos feelings are shared by the dozens of elderly 
spaniards playing cards chatting or sharing a beer in the sunny 
patio of the neighborhood senior citizen community center 
but as the countrys population of 39 million ages rapidly 
fewer and fewer elderly spaniards will be able to live with their 
children the traditional way of dealing with aging in most spanish 
families 
this is just one of the changes resulting from the acceleration 
of the graying of spanish society according to doctors and 
activists who work with the elderly 
they say more nursing homes will be needed the health care 
system will have to adapt and new programs will have to be 
developed to help the elderly live independently as long as they 
can 
according to official statistics 5 million spaniards are 65 or 
older up from 46 million four years ago that is projected to 
rise to 61 million by 2000 
as their numbers grow spanish senior citizens are beginning to 
unite to fight for their interests 
in 1988 they formed the council for the elderly banding 
together dozens of small groups with a combined membership of more 
than 1 million 
the rapid aging of spains population is partly due to medical 
advances that have extended lifeexpectancy around the world 
but it is also the result of two peculiarly spanish events the 
193639 civil war and the end of the dictatorship of gen francisco 
franco in 1975 
because an estimated 1 million people died in the war and its 
aftermath of reprisals the current generation of senior citizens 
is smaller than it would have been otherwise 
as the remaining members of the war generation die and as the 
members of the larger postwar generation become senior citizens 
the elderly population will continue growing 
in 1970 the death rate was 841 per 1000 people in 1986 the 
last year for which comprehensive statistics are available it had 
fallen to 804 
meanwhile the birthrate has been falling dramatically from 
1955 per 1000 residents in 1970 to 1137 per 1000 in 1986 
the roman catholic church wielded great influence during the 
franco years and couples were encouraged to have large families 
but since the restoration of democracy in 1977 the influence of 
the church has waned and families are having fewer children 
in the last 10 years spain has changed as much as a normal 
country changes in 30 said juan manuel martinez gomez secretary 
general of the spanish society of geriatrics and gerontology 
manuela jimenez carrera director of a small private residence 
in madrid that is home to nine elderly women said more and more 
women are working outside the home and no longer have time to care 
for their elderly parents as they did in the past 
francisco verdu president of the council for the elderly said 
a lack of housing is one of the most serious problems facing 
spains elderly 
according to the ministry of social affairs 24000 people are 
on waiting lists for public housing for the elderly the problem is 
expected to worsen and the ministry estimates 107000 nursing home 
or group residency beds will be needed in the year 2000 
ministry officials say that the government will not be able to 
build enough housing to meet demand and that some of the new beds 
will have to be built by the private sector 
but critics say the government needs to tighten regulation of 
private nursing homes that are often nothing more than hotels 
illequipped to meet medical dietary and psychological needs of 
senior citizens 
spaniards were shocked recently by television images of 
malnourished elderly women covered with bedsores being removed from 
a private barcelona nursing home shut down following complaints 
from relatives of the residents 
according to martinez gomez of the spanish society of geriatrics 
and gerontology spain has no more than 100 specialists in 
geriatric medicine which has only been offered in medical school 
since 1978 
we are far far below where we should be he said 
complicating the problem verdu said is the tendency of elderly 
spaniards to swallow pills on their own because there is not 
sufficient control of the overthecounter sale of drugs

as spains population rapidly grows older 
one of the countrys most serious medical problems will be 
alzheimers disease few people here know much about it 
theres very little practical information for families to 
explain how to deal with the problem said manuel martinez gomez 
secretary general of the spanish society for geriatrics and 
gerontology 
he said 250000 to 300000 spaniards now suffer from alzheimers 
disease 
and with spains older population expected to increase 20 
percent to 61 million by the year 2000 the number of victims is 
likely to follow the curve 
alzheimers disease was discovered in 1906 by alois alzheimer a 
german neuropathologist it is a progressive brain disorder that 
causes the slow deterioration of the victims mind it causes 
changes in the nerve cells in the brain and usually results in 
death within two to 20 years 
there is still no cure for the disease and the cause is unknown 
it results in severe memory loss confusion inability to 
perform routine tasks personality changes and eventually total 
physical and mental incapacity 
martinez gomez said he knew of no medical centers in spain that 
specialize in treating alzheimers patients most of whom are cared 
for at home

people over age 65 make up 13 percent of 
the american population yet they take 30 percent of all 
prescription medicines sold in this country 
one billion times each year americans 65 or older take 
overthecounter drugs while these medicines offer many benefits 
they carry some risks 
almost everyone has a favorite story about the number of pills 
potions or elixirs taken by an older relative or friend while most 
of these stories have a happy ending some do not when taking any 
medication caution and common sense are necessary 
some basic rules for safe use of medicine 
take exactly the amount your doctor prescribes and follow the 
dosage schedule as closely as possible contact your doctor or 
pharmacist immediately if you have unusual reactions to medications 
make sure to ask your doctor for the specific name of the 
medicine prescribed ask why the drug is necessary how long the 
drug will have to be taken and if there is a good generic 
substitute 
tell your doctor about all other medicines prescription and 
over the counter you are taking interactions between medications 
can cause serious complications 
keep a daily log it should include the name of the medicine 
the doctor who prescribed it and the schedule for taking it 
include a space to check off each dose 
be sure to tell your doctor about past problems such as 
rashes indigestion dizziness lack of appetite that occurred 
when you took other medicines 
be sure to ask your doctor about side effects the best way to 
store the medicine and any special rules for example should the 
medicine be taken with foods or beverages should you limit your 
activities while taking the medicine 
make sure the directions printed on the medicine container are 
clear ask the pharmicist to use easytoopen containers if 
childproof ones are hard to handle the pharmacist can use large 
type on the label to help people with vision problems 
do not share your medicines with friends or relatives do 
not save medicines for use at another time 
do not stop taking a medicine prescribed by your doctor 
suddenly even if the symptoms go away 
ask your doctor from time to time to review the medications 
you take new information about medicines and how they affect older 
people is coming to light daily 
for more information on the safe use of medications contact

the elderhealth program offers free publications such as you 
and your medicines choosing the right not wrong 
nonprescription medicine and aging and how it affects your 
response to medicine

evaluation and research consumer and professional affairs 
hfd365 5000 fishers lane rockville md 20857 301295801 
will provide information on specific drugs and their side effects 
keep in mind that a chemical agent strong enough to cure an 
ailment is also strong enough to cause harm if not used wisely 
although people should never stop taking medecine without medical 
advice if a drug seems to be causing more harm then good dont be 
afraid to discuss the matter with your doctor she or he may be 
able to prescribe a different drug that will be just as effective

think of a budget as a forecast a measure an 
estimate a plan a projection or cash flow management 
budgeting is a balancing act that requires planning and goal 
setting in the simplest sense budgeting involves matching your 
outflow with your income in timing and amounts successful cash 
flow management is based on being aware of the unique pattern of 
inflows and outflows that make up your financial life 
for most people its relatively easy to list the sources 
amounts and timing of income because income usually does not 
fluctuate from month to month the main challenge for salaried 
employees is to gather and analyze information about the outflow 
categories 
if your income is erratic say you are in sales and on 
commission youll encounter difficulty projecting and matching 
inflows for the coming year use your earning history and your 
plans for the present year as your guide even though your income 
fluctuates you can still focus on patterns emerging over time 
tracking where your money goes will be your next step refer to 
your checkbook registers receipts statements tax returns and 
floppy disks 
unless you inadvertently hide the nature of all your 
transactions by writing checks to cash and using automatic 
teller machines for cash advances you should have some kind of 
financial records 
if the task of determining where your money goes seems 
overwhelming at first paint the picture in broad strokes develop 
amounts for expense categories ie housing meals auto etc 
if you find that you have to guess at most categories even 
after gathering all the records you have youll have to conduct an 
experiment in which you observe your spending habits 
keep a spending journal for three to four months keep track of 
all the money you spend yes that means tallying up amounts for 
coffee and doughnuts magazines for plane trips new windshield 
wipers and gadgets from the hardware store 
before you throw your hands up in dismay realize that you are 
not alone very few people can accurately quote the amounts they 
spend on clothing taxis lunches pet care hobbies household 
supplies and other items 
your goal is to develop a list of monthly expenses you will 
discover some expenditures occur every month and are relatively 
fixed others will vary in amount andor timing 
budgeting involves matching your income with your outflow when 
there is a mismatch ie the outflows are projected to exceed the 
inflows you can 1 build up an adequate cash reserve to cover 
those times 2 modify the timing of the inflows or outflows 3 
increase the size of the inflows andor 4 reduce the size of the 
outflows 
build an emergency reserve it is important to build up a cash 
cushion of at least six months worth of expenses as with every 
rule of thumb there are exceptions 
for example if you are able to cover the critical monthly 
living expenses from another income source you might consider a 
smaller reserve however the best preparation for a financial 
pinch is an adequate reserve when outflow requirements exceed 
inflow available all youll need to do is dip into the reserve 
modify the timing of inflows or outflows keep your money in 
an interestbearing account and pay bills close to due dates if 
necessary contact creditors to rescedule payments they may allow 
you to miss a few payments or stretch the time over which you make 
the payments 
unless you are in control of how you use your credit cards you 
might want to make all purchases by cash or check however 
judicious use of credit can allow you to delay making payments 
its a good idea to pay for existing purchases before going into 
debt for new items and instead of making only the minimum 
payments required by the company make the payment larger to take 
care of interest and reduction of principal 
increase inflows to do this you can liquidate assets or 
borrow money in extremely tight situations you can rent out a 
room in your house or find ways to earn extra money 
depending on your mindset borrowing may be a workable option 
some financial planners say you should always try to borrow against 
assets before selling off those assets disrupting your investment 
program by selling valuable assets may not be in your best 
interest also borrowing will result in yet another fixed outflow 
reduce outflows reduce certain outflows until the financial 
crunch subsides wherever an outflow is variable determine how you 
can reduce the outflow consider the pros and cons of refinancing 
an expensive mortgage 
cut back on magazine subscriptions or decrease spending on 
gifts modify plans for wardrobe purchases take care of the lawn 
yourself 
finally if necessary set your survival standard of living and 
stick to it when the financial crisis passes dont automatically 
return to your previous standard instead increase your emergency 
reserve first even when your income increases resist the urge to 
immediately upgrade your standard of living 
as the motto says plan ahead start today so youll be 
able to take control of your financial life through cash flow 
management

a gardener feeling jaded might get a 
lift with a different bean go french perhaps with filets and 
flageolets countless varieties exist of this ancient food plant of 
the aztecs and incas and breeders keep creating new ones 
next years catalogs for example will introduce a pole bean 
called kentucky blue winner of an all america selections 
award the new bean combines traits of two already superb pole 
beans kentucky wonder and blue lake something like 
crossing a mercedes with a cadillac the breeder was calvin 
lamborn an idaho horticulturist who won a previous award for a 
sugar snap pea 
in 40 years of gardening the most attractive bean ive met is a 
superslim frenchie called haricot vert ahreeco vair 
probably best known as filet bean this sweet and tender bean 
is as fussy as it is elegant if you dont pick it at the right 
moment when its shoelacethin and no seeds have formed the pod 
toughens and the flavor goes off a single day can make a 
difference 
a gourmet shell bean becoming popular in american gardens is the 
flageolet flahjohlay celebrated in french cuisine as an 
accompaniment to roast lamb ive grown this tiny bean and admired 
its taste and looks but it takes a lot of them to make a meal 
this year i grew soybeans for the first time of probably asian 
origin the soy was practically unknown in america until commodore 
matthew perry brought some back from japan in 1854 this shell bean 
contains highquality protein and also some fat but breeders 
still are working to improve its flavor in my garden a variety 
called butterbeans took 90 days to mature producing small 
fuzzy pods about 2 inches long which were tough to pry open 
inside were two to three seeds as green as peas they kept their 
nice color in cooking but i found the taste on the bland side 
the soy and another shell bean the fava known in europe since 
homeric times are the only beans of nonamerindian heritage 
unlike other beans the fava withstands frost sown in midmarch 
it matures in june the earliest bean in my southern new york 
garden the fava also known as broad bean and windsor bean is 
delicious raw its still a favorite of picnickers in rome where 
in ancient times it gave its name to a prominent family the 
fabii but some people get an anemia called favism by eating 
raw or partly cooked favas 
bean pods of various shades of green yellow and purple 
contain some vitamin c and a and their taste is a summer delight 
but its the seeds that pack the protein hence the importance of 
shell beans in the human diet theyre meat substitutes meals of 
beans and rice beans and corn or beans and pasta combing 
proteins and carbohydrates are classic fare lima beans have been 
found in inca digs dating to 7000 bc in north america the 
colonists saw indians growing corn and beans together using the 
cornstalks for the beans to climb on 
you dont need much savvy to grow beans just be sure the soil 
is thoroughly warm when you sow them or theyll rot climbing beans 
need supports of course tripods being the best to resist high

in this day of the freezer a gardener can store fresh shell 
beans saving himself the labor of drying them the fresh ones 
taste better than the mealyprone dry ones i think and they cook 
much faster seeds keep excellently in the freezer unlike pods 
which emerge from the ice limp and practically tasteless 
a shell bean called limelight gave me an abundant harvest in 
early august of light green beans resembling baby limas in looks 
and flavor each easytoshell pod contained six or seven seeds 
pole lima beans yield the biggest seeds of all some as large 
as quarters and with a taste far superior to the dried ones 
their longmaturing time makes them unfeasible for the coldest 
parts of the country in my borderline area i push the season by 
starting them indoors in pots like tomatoes by late may when i 
put them in the ground theyre sturdy plants with favorable 
weather i begin harvesting these big limas late in august more 
than a month before frost 
a helpful practice in growing limas is to sow the seeds with the 
eye the tiny notch facing down this makes them germinate 
easier in crusty soil some growers even leave the top of the seed 
uncovered ive had fine results with a variety of pole lima called 
king of the garden but now im ready to diversify next time 
im planting highly recommended lima called christmas

characteristic of the woman who started the gray panthers as a 
voice for those not ready to give in to age ms kuhn turned 85 on 
aug 3 
for her work over the years the new yorkbased giraffe society 
recognized her as a member one of the people who stick their 
necks out

ice cream a special award called the 1000 pints of lite a 
play on bushs thousand points of light campaign 
the truck that brought the ice cream from vermont couldnt make 
it the short way to ms kuhns germantown home because of a low 
railroad trestle it did make it however and the neighborhood was 
invited to eat and carry away all they could 
there was rain and ben and jerry put up this enormous yellow 
tent ms kuhn said in describing the giving away of the pints of

chrysler corp is adding a half year and 1 
billion to its costcutting program boosting the target to 25 
billion by june 1991 chairman lee iacocca says 
iacocca said in an interview in todays edition of the wall 
street journal that the company is near the 15 billion target set 
for the end of this year without the cuts chrysler would not be 
profitable he said 
wall street analysts and chrysler officials expect the company 
will post a substantial loss in the third quarter mainly because 
of an interruption of minivan production at two plants 
during the first half of the year chrysler earned 251 million 
down 64 percent from last year 
in october 1989 chrysler began its costcutting program with an 
initial target of 1 billion by the end of 1990 that was raised to 
15 billion and now iacocca says it will be 25 billion by next 
june 
if we can get 25 billion ill give our guys a lot of 
credit he told the journal the last 1 billion obviously gets 
a little harder 
also in the interview iacocca said 
the company hoped to find a good european partner to help 
with vehicle development and production first probably with 
minivans and jeeps chryslers two biggest moneymakers previously 
he acknowledged that chrysler and the italian industrial giant fiat 
spa have been talking about a business deal 
former vice chairman gerald greenwalds departure last may was 
a bit of an emotional jolt for me he wanted greenwald to 
succeed him as chairman greenwald left chrysler to head a 
threeunion bid to buy united airlines 
chrysler will maintain its current 30centsashare stock 
dividend despite recent quarterly profits insufficient to cover the 
payments 
but all good companies go through some periods where they 
dont earn the dividend but continue to pay it iacocca said 
chryslers 45 billion in cash reserves should remain largely 
untouched unless the mideast crisis escalates and new car and truck 
sales plummet

after surviving a decade of civil war 
nicaraguans face inflation of 80 percent a month and threetiered 
pricing that turns a shopping trip into an exercise for number 
crunchers 
many people tuck a calculator into purse or pocket before 
leaving home 
i have to think twice before going out to buy anything said 
susana montenegro a middleclass housewife encountered in a 
supermarket and not just because everything is so expensive 
its the conversions back and forth they give me a headache 
a new currency called the gold cordoba and the rules governing 
its value have made a confusing economy even more so 
gold cordobas officially trade at par with the dollar and are 
supposed to replace the old cordobas which nicaraguans have 
christened chancheros or piggies to set them apart from 
the new ones 
when mrs montenegro buys a 5pound bag of beans she can pay in 
either gold cordobas or dollars and get change in piggies at the 
official exchange rate or she can pay the entire amount in piggies 
into her decision and calculations she must factor the 
principle that a piggy in hand should be a piggy spent quickly 
because it will buy less next week 
devaluations of the piggy which occur each monday make last 
weeks black market rate this weeks official exchange rate 
erasing what advantage there had been in trading with the 
coyotes who deal in currency in response the coyotes change 
their own rate 
francisco mayorga president of the central bank hailed the 
gold cordoba as the cornerstone of the economic revival promised by 
the new government but it has been a mild flop 
only 4 million worth have been released into the market since 
the gold cordobas debut aug 13 about 5 percent of the total 
money in circulation and much of that is back in the bank vaults 
few people use the gold cordoba suspicious consumers prefer 
dollars or even piggies although 900000 of them were needed to 
buy a dollar at the end of august 
the government says it will issue only as many gold cordobas as 
it has dollars to back them up 
official parity remains in effect but real parity began 
dissolving when the government stores that sell foreign goods only 
for dollars added a 1 percent charge for anyone paying with gold 
cordobas 
coyotes wont touch the new currency 
most people who buy dollars from me are merchants who go to 
honduras and guatemala to buy and the gold cordobas are not 
accepted over there said one who would not give his name the 
dollar is the dollar anywhere the gold cordoba is something that 
only panchito mayorga likes 
public employees who received 50 gold cordobas each as part of 
their pay can use them to pay utility bills which are higher now 
that subsidies have been ended 
restaurants supermarkets and other businesses have converted 
prices to gold cordobas but accept piggies at the official rate 
and dollars 
to cope with the rising cost of living people usually change 
their gold cordobas at banks for dollars and trade the dollars for 
piggies with streetcorner coyotes who pay about 10 percent above 
the official rate 
mrs montenegro tries to keep up with exchange rates because 
there have been 40 devaluations this year 33 of them under 
president violeta chamorros government since it succeeded the 
sandinistas four months ago 
if she receives dollars from relatives in the united states as 
many nicaraguans do she is better off changing them on the black 
market and paying bills in piggies 
many nicaraguans feel the higher rate on the black market 
offsets the risk of a police raid during the transaction

asian governments that want to control what 
their people see on television are fighting a losing battle with 
satellites and receiving dishes 
direct broadcasts from foreign countries into private homes via 
satellite are spreading rapidly 
some officials fret over the impact on their peoples values and 
way of life western diplomats say others fear their social and 
political control might be questioned if citizens have wider 
freedom of choice 
ever smaller and cheaper receiving dishes and the launch of a 
major telecommunications satellite make it increasingly difficult 
for governments to deny viewers direct access to foreign television 
we may not be able to check foreign tv intruding into our 
lives for much longer prime minister lee kuan yew of singapore 
said in 1988 but he has done a pretty good job so far 
the only known satellitereception dish not in his governments 
hands that is capable of receiving foreign programs sits on the 
roof of the us embassy installation was permitted strictly for 
embassy use two years after an application was filed 
others in this prosperous citystate are prohibited by law from 
owning or selling such dishes except for export foreign programs 
for the three singapore broadcasting corp channels are screened to 
filter out unacceptable and harmful values and lifestyles said 
communications official mah bow tan 
one official said full access to foreign tv shows permissive 
american offerings especially could harm a young nation composed 
of different races religions and cultures he said censorship of 
foreign movies magazines and tv was necessary to repel cultural 
subversion 
not everyone agrees lim boon heng a member of parliament said 
the government should consider broadcasting to the surrounding 
region by satellite and stop trying to control the use of receiving 
dishes 
compact new receivers are small enough to fit into a suitcase 
and lim said when dishes get to that size the authorities will 
have a hard time to control the use of satellite receivers so 
why fight it 
a major enemy in this information war is positioned slightly to 
the east and 22753 miles up asiasat1 was launched from china in 
april by a long march iii rocket and is in orbit near the equator 
telecommunications satellites are not new to the region 
indonesia was the first country in asia and third in the world 
after canada and the united states to have a domestic satellite 
japan and australia also have communications satellites 
asiasat1 the first privately owned satellite has the 
potential to beam signals to and from the middle east singapore 
and tokyo and could offer a dozen new channels to an area with 
more than 2 billion potential viewers the owner is a consortium 
led by hutchison whampoa holdings ltd and based in hong kong 
in indonesia alone where reception from the governments palapa 
series of satellites was established in 1976 an estimated 25000 
dishes can pick up asiasat1 
hong kong officials announced in early august that individuals 
could own and operate dishes for personal use without licenses 
lifting a ban that had been widely ignored for years broadcasters 
and operators of dishes that serve more than one viewer must have 
licenses 
elsewhere the picture is equally mixed 
satellite dishes are legal in the philippines upon approval of 
an application but few applications are approved those who can 
afford it put them up anyway apparently assuming the government 
has more important rules to enforce 
direct reception of satellite television still is forbidden in 
thailand which maintains close control over telecommunications 
but pressure against the policy is increasing 
we cannot stop technologies from growing joompol rodcumdee 
of chulalongkorn university in thailand told a regional seminar on 
the socioeconomic impact of broadcast satellites 
today we may say we will not use them but tomorrow we may not 
be able to get away from them he said 
vijay menon secretarygeneral of the asian mass communication 
research and information center said the estimated 150000 
satellite dishes in south korea were not viewed as a blessing or 
even as a sign of progress 
journalism professors have been filling local newspapers with 
letters denouncing the impact of foreign tv on korean society he 
said foreign programs they feel are making viewers in korea 
adopt alien ways of thinking life and customs and deepening the 
dependency of korea on alien culture 
malaysia bans private satellites for direct tv reception and 
madzhi johari of the government broadcast training institute said 
direct access to broadcasting satellites means direct import of 
norms and values of the developed countries and will result in 
stress and conflict in our society indonesians seem relaxed 
about the impact of numerous private dishes which fall into a 
legal nomans land neither permitted nor forbidden 
there is no need to be alarmed over the possible unfavorable 
consequences be they cultural political or economic said a 
senior executive at tvri the government network 
diplomats in jakarta attribute the lack of concern to the fact 
that most foreign programs are in english or other languages 
relatively few indonesians understand

a subsidiary of a scottish banking group agreed to 
buy most of bank of new england corps rhode island operation for 
75 million tuesday buying a little hope for the troubled banks 
prospects 
the deal will sell most of the best of bank of new englandold 
colony assets to the citizens financial group of providence ri 
citizens is a subsidiary of the royal bank of scotland group a 
financial services holding company 
selling off its rhode island interest is the last major move in 
bank of new englands efforts to boost its capital and restructure 
its operation 
this sale virtually completes our program to downsize the 
company and to concentrate our efforts on our strong franchises in 
connecticut maine and massachusetts bne chairman and chief 
officer lawrence k fish said in a prepared statement 
it happens to fit our franchise well said kenneth e 
hogberg chief financial officer of citizens in an interview from 
providence we think the franchise will continue to carry a lot 
of value 
with the disposal of the rhode island subsidiary bank of new 
england will be left with three major subsidiaries maine national 
bank connecticut bank and trust and bank of new england they 
employ about 14000 people a bank spokesman said 
the bank has been shedding assets and its work force since it 
came under increased government scrutiny when the regions economy 
began to slide and the real estate market exposed piles of bad 
loans 
the bank lost more than 1 billion in 1989 it has lost 466 
million in the first quarter that ended march 31 and more than 30 
million in the second quarter of this year 
analysts said the sale of old colony is good for bank of new 
england but cant be looked upon as the transaction that will 
start the companys turnaround 
more important will be reducing its nonperforming assets the 
analysts said that in turn depends on whether the new england 
economy recovers soon 
picture a guy crossing a desert dying and they find a small 
oasis with a little bit of water don j kauth an analyst at 
first albany corp said of the sale of old colony the question 
is will they make the rest of the way across the desert it 
depends on how wide the desert is 
unless the economy improves the bank of new england is going 
to run out of capital before they run out of nonperforming 
assets kauth said 
bank of new england bought the 70yearold former old 
colonynewport national bank in 1986 
under the agreement citizens will acquire 600 million of 
selected old colony assets while bank of new england keeps 550 
million in assets it will also acquire more than 900 million in 
deposits while bank of new england keeps about 250 million in 
deposits liabilities and capital 
also under the terms citizens will acquire and operate the old 
colony branch network as part of citizens bank while bank of new 
england keeps the bancnew england mortgage co a subsidiary of old 
colony based in east providence 
the deal would increase citizens assets to 37 billion making 
it rhode islands second biggest bank 
the bank of new england fell victim to the rumor mill last week 
its stock falling 62 cents a share to 1 thursday after a 
congressional candidate erroneously suggested federal regulators 
had recommended a takeover of the bank 
the comptroller of the currency in washington the chief 
regulator for the bank of new england as well as the bank denied 
and denounced the rumors

fujitsu japans largest computer maker announced 
a powerful new mainframe computer tuesday that it says is the 
fastest in the world the news came a day before rival ibm is 
expected announce its new topoftheline models 
both companies are depending on their newgeneration mainframes 
to maintain their technological and competitive leadership in 
highend computers 
international business machines corp has refused to release 
details of its new computer line before its announcement scheduled 
for wednesday 
fujitsu officials said the top model in their new m1800 series 
is capable of executing up to 600 million instructions per second 
or mips in scientific calculations 
analysts say the new ibm topoftheline computer codenamed 
the summit will run at a maximum speed of about 230 mips the most 
powerful current ibm mainframe can handle about 112 mips 
however ibm the worlds largest computer company is expected 
to announce that customers will be able to link several of the new 
models together to boost power dramatically perhaps exceeding 600 
mips 
toshio hiraguri general manager of fujitsus computer systems 
group said the 600 mips figure doesnt adequately represent 
typical operating conditions under which he said the m1800 series 
would run even faster 
unlike supercomputers which are designed to make repetitive 
scientific calculations mainframes must be able to handle a wide 
range of general business data base and communications information 
often at the same time 
we believe fujitsus mainframe will be competitive not just 
today but also tomorrow a company official said referring to 
ibms expected announcement 
nec in july announced a mainframe that it says is capable of 500 
mips but it uses a different operating system than the system 
shared by ibm fujitsu and hitachi making a direct comparison of 
processing speeds difficult the operating system is the base layer 
of software that controls internal computer functions 
hitachi in june announced it will build a mainframe capable of 
155 mips 
fujitsus m1800 series speed comes in part from special 
highspeed logic and memory chips highcapacity fiberoptic 
interconnections and sophisticated batch processing of data the 
company said the topoftheline model 85 also will be the first 
mainframe in the world with eight processors it said 
the new ibm computers will have similar features except the top 
model will have only six processors analysts say 
fujitsu officials denied that they timed their announcement 
tuesday to reduce the impact of ibms news conference in the united 
states 
weve been planning to begin shipments next april and our 
customers have been asking us to make the announcement as soon as 
possible a fujitsu official said so its just a coincidence 
that ibm decided to announce its computer at about the same time 
ibm officials declined to comment tuesday on fujitsus 
announcement the us company depends on sales of mainframes and 
associated software and equipment for about half its annual profit 
fujitsu said it plans to sell about 300 of the 
multimilliondollar systems over the next three years with most 
sales likely to be in japan the computers also will be sold 
overseas under the nameplate of siemens ag the west german 
computer company and their technology is likely to appear in 
mainframes produced by amdahl corp a us maker of ibmcompatible 
mainfames that is 45 percent owned by fujitsu 
amdahl and hitachi generally have undercut ibms mainframe 
prices and have eaten into its sales in recent years although ibm 
still has about 87 percent of the us highend mainframe market 
says computer intelligence a california research firm 
some industry analysts have predicted a declining market for 
large generalservice mainframes saying customers would be better 
off buying increasingly sophisticated smaller computer workstations 
that can be tailored to specific functions 
several of the new fujitsu machines however can be linked 
together with each handling separate functions such as data base 
processing communications and application processing to customize 
and maximize performance the company said 
with this announcement we want to say that the mainframe 
business is not dead said a fujitsu official speaking on 
condition of anonymity they will continue to be the main anchor 
for customers whether they be researchers or businesses 
fujitsu said it expects to sell most of its m1800 systems to 
financial institutions research institutes government 
organizations and engineering facilities

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states rose again this week climbing by 10 to 1012 
baker hughes inc reported 
a week ago the count had increased by 15 to total 1002 the 
count a year ago this week was 936 baker hughes said tuesday 
the houstonbased oil toolmaker company has kept track of the 
rig count the widely watched index of drilling activity since 
1940 the count represents the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil not those producing oil 
ike kerridge keeper of the count at baker hughes said tuesday 
that the increase in oil prices caused by the middle east crisis 
probably is beginning to have some positive impact on the rig count 
some of the count increase may be a reflection of higher 
prices although it is the season when the count goes up 
anyway kerridge said and the increase have been modest but 
if the middle east crisis hasnt begun to affect it yet i think 
it will very shortly 
kerridge said there is no absolute way to judge exactly how 
rising oil prices affects the domestic rig count 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states kansas added seven rigs to its 
count followed by california and wyoming which each gained five 
colorados count was up four ohio was up three texas gained two 
rigs and pennsylvania added one more 
louisiana lost eight rigs oklahomas count was down by six and 
north dakota lost two

oil futures prices surged tuesday as fading 
hopes for a settlement to the middle east crisis helped turn 
traders attention to the prospects for tight supplies in the last 
three months of the year 
the october contract for light sweet crude oil rose 180 a 
42gallon barrel to settle at 2912 on the new york mercantile 
exchange the contract had risen 55 cents on friday the last 
trading day before the labor day holiday 
contracts for petroleum products also posted sharp advances 
october contracts for unleaded regular gasoline jumped 834 cents a 
gallon to settle at 9452 cents the september contract had risen 
725 cents before expiring at the close of trading friday 
home heating oil for october delivery settled at 8239 cents per 
gallon up 583 cents the expiring september contract had gained 
035 cent on friday 
higher oil prices which are a harbinger of higher inflation 
sent bond prices lower in other markets stock prices were mixed 
with the dow jones average of 30 industrials falling less than a 
point in currency dealings the dollar slumped 
even in the absence of significant developments in the persian 
gulf analysts had expected energy futures prices to spike higher 
following a sharp advance in london on monday 
traders turned their attention to the basic supply and demand 
balances said oil analyst jim murchie of sanford c bernstein amp 
co things are quiet enough now for people to go back and do the 
basic work 
present oil supplies may not meet demand for the chilly fourth 
quarter murchie said adding that half the worlds oil is used for 
heating in the last quarter of the year oil stocks are typically 
drawn down to meet heightened demand 
before the crisis we were expecting a 1 to 15 million barrel 
a day drawdown now were projecting a 2 to 25 million barrels a 
day to meet fourthquarter demand murchie said 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries recent 
agreement to increase its daily crude production quota to 225 
million barrels daily still falls short of projected fourthquarter 
demand murchie said 
during a crisis those who hold oil contracts are reluctant to 
sell which pushes the price higher experts said there was a lack 
of sellers on tuesday which was responsible for the rise in prices 
amid moderate volume 
the market also was weighed down by disappointment over the slow 
release of hostages by iraq and the unsuccessful attempts by united 
nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to mediate the 
crisis 
people are a little more pessimistic and war is a little 
bit more on their minds today said james fiedler a vice 
president at edampf man international inc in explaining the 
advance in oil prices 
but he also said the markets behavior was unusual in light of 
last weeks action when crude contracts opened 1 a barrel lower 
after a weekend also devoid of major developments

american airlines and united airlines 
have tabled their dispute at chicagos ohare international 
airport pending a decision from the federal aviation 
administration 
a hearing had been scheduled tuesday over whether to bar united 
from operating under new flight schedules at ohare us district 
judge john mcbride last month ordered united to make changes in its 
schedule 
fort worthbased american contends uniteds proposed schedule is 
misleading to passengers 
but the airlines requested a postponement of tuesdays hearing 
to sept 17 while they await the faa decision american spokesman 
tim smith said 
what happened is that we have not as yet heard any decision 
from the faa and both parties have agreed to essentially postpone 
the hearing in federal court for a couple of weeks because we did 
not want to be in the middle of that and get some kind of decision 
from the faa smith said 
if the faa ruling favors american smith said the lawsuit likely 
would be dropped obviously if the faa ruled in uniteds favor 
we would continue our legal pursuit of the matter he said 
united schedules starting oct 1 reflect notyet approved 
deviations from federal guidelines on takeoffs and landings at 
ohare american said 
the highdensity slot rules are intended to regulate traffic at 
four of the nations busiest airports by designating times for 
takeoffs and landings 
united contends the schedules were carefully designed to 
reduce congestion and delay at ohare 
united based in chicago earlier this year replaced american as 
the nations largest carrier

memories magazine is cutting back its 
publication schedule because of the weak advertising climate its 
publishers announced tuesday 
diamandis communications inc a us subsidiary of frances 
hachette sa said that regular publication of memories will be 
suspended with its october issue it said memories will appear 
twice a year starting in 1991 
the magazine has been published every other month since early 
1989 and plans had been to make it a monthly this fall 
but peter diamandis president and chief executive of diamandis 
communications said the current softness in the advertising 
marketplace makes it imprudent to continue the current rollout 
plan 
hachette made the move after efforts to sell the magazine failed 
memories was launched in the spring of 1988 and sought to tap 
readers fascination in the past by taking another look at major 
events of the past 50 years among the stories it updated were the 
battle of britain the kennedy assassination the march of dimes 
crusade and baseball slugger ted williams 
but it ran into a tough ad environment ad pages in magazines 
were down 33 percent in the first half of 1990 compared with a 
year earlier according to publishers information bureau and no 
signs of a pickup in demand are evident 
so far this year the ad slump has figured in the closing 
suspension consolidation and redesign of several magazines 
woman 7 days and southpoint magazines have folded psychology 
today suspended publication in january but hopes to reappear in 
january manhattan inc magazine ceased publication and merged with 
the fashion magazine m under the new title m inc the nightlife 
magazine details was converted into a general interest mens 
magazine 
didier guerin president of hachette publications inc which 
oversees diamandis communications said memories was up for sale 
for a couple months and that a deal was nearly reached with 
mortimer zuckerman the real estate baron who is chairman and 
editor in chief of us news amp world report and chairman of the 
atlantic monthly magazine 
zuckerman said in a telephone interview that he talked with 
hachette about memories but said we never made a formal proposal 
to buy the magazine 
we came to the conclusion that the economy was so bad and 
getting worse that it wasnt good time to be excessively 
adventuresome he said 
guerin said the deteriorating economic climate is prompting 
advertisers to cut back on ad spending the last thing they need 
is a new publication that is not established he said 
nonetheless he said memories would be published twice a year 
because its still a good concept still a strong name and we 
should be able to keep it alive at that rate if the economy 
improves he said the magazine could be published more often it 
has promised advertisers a circulation of 600000 
the magazine had a staff of 27 and guerin said efforts would be 
made to find jobs for them at other hachette magazines those other 
titles include boating car and driver elle and popular 
photography 
guerin said there were a few others in addition to zuckerman 
who expressed interest in memories but he declined to identify 
them 
he said none of the other hachette magazines are on the market 
earlier this year hachette put its womans day magazine up for 
sale to trim the companys debt but pulled it off the market in 
july after bidders failed to show up with the price it wanted 
the magazines demise comes less than two weeks before the 
premiere of a weekly television show that has licensed the 
magazines name memories then and now 
the show is being produced by nbc news productions a unit of 
the national broadcasting co and will be carried starting sept 
15 on more than 120 stations serving more than 80 percent of the 
nations households with tv 
therese byrne head of the unit said there was no editorial 
link between the magazine and the television show however and 
that the reduced frequency of the magazine should have no impact on 
the show

the nations purchasing managers said tuesday 
that manufacturing slowed in august providing more evidence of a 
looming recession and signs that the persian gulf crisis is taking 
a toll on the economy 
the national association of purchasing management which tracks 
the manufacturing economy through a monthly poll of its members 
said its overall index of business activity at 300 industrial 
companies fell to 470 percent from 474 percent in july 
when the index registers below 50 percent it indicates the 
economy is weakening 
the drop in the index was the second consecutive monthly 
decline the index stood at 511 percent in june 
the purchasing managers report contained few surprises but 
still was evidence that the economy is slowing down and slowing 
down fast said david wyss chief financial economist for 
drimcgraw hill in lexington mass 
the report said production and new orders were down in august 
prices for raw materials moved sharply higher and employment was 
down prices and employment appeared to be affected by the 
monthlong persian gulf crisis 
wyss said the employment component in particular suggests 
quite frankly that businesses are quite scared by the mideast 
they taking on fewer people 
economic news from washington tuesday also was less than 
encouraging the commerce department reported construction spending 
edged up 04 percent in july for its first gain in four months but 
the government revised downward its estimate of spending in may and 
june 
despite the july gain analysts expect the industry to remain 
weak due to consumer caution high interest rates tight lending 
requirements and in some areas overbuilding 
a report on productivity was equally downbeat the labor 
department said the productivity of american workers improved for 
the first time in more than a year climbing in the second quarter 
at an annual rate of 15 percent 
but the advance was well below the level needed to significantly 
boost americans standard of living furthermore the productivity 
report contained figures showing steep labor cost increases which 
elevated concerns that inflation is accelerating especially in 
light of the middle east oil crisis that threatens to step up price 
increases 
the purchasing managers noting production was off for the first 
time in seven months attributed the slowdown to a sharp drop in 
new orders in july 
twenty percent of the purchasing managers said production was up 
in august while 54 percent reported it was unchanged and 26 
percent said it was down that compared with 19 percent reporting 
higher production in july 58 percent reporting it was unchanged 
and 23 percent saying it had slowed 
new orders dropped for the second straight month twentyone 
percent of the purchasing managers said new orders rose during 
august while 49 percent reported they were stable and 30 percent 
reported they had declined in july 19 percent reported growth in 
new orders 53 percent reported they were the same and 28 percent 
said they had declined 
the purchasing managers said export orders also dropped as did 
imports 
prices for raw materials rose during august a reflection of 
higher energy prices resulting from the gulf crisis twentytwo 
percent of the purchasing managers said they were paying higher 
prices 68 percent said they were paying the same amount and 10 
percent said prices were down that compared with 12 percent 
reporting higher prices in july 77 reporting stable prices and 11 
percent reporting lower prices 
employment fell for the 18th straight month during august and at 
a slightly faster rate than in july nine percent of the purchasing 
executives said employment was up at their companies 68 percent 
said it was the same and 23 percent said it was down in july 13 
percent said employment was up 70 percent said it was the same and 
17 percent reported a decline 
the lone bright spot in the august report was a slowing in 
supplier deliveries which indicated companies had more orders than 
they could fill seven percent of the purchasing managers surveyed 
said supplier deliveries were slower 87 percent reported they were 
the same and 6 percent said they were faster that compared with 6 
percent who said they were slower in july 83 percent who said they 
were the same and 11 percent who said they were faster 
the purchasing managers also said inventories continued to 
decline last month 
the national association of purchasing management is a research 
and education organization with more than 33000 members

york mercantile exchange amid reports the us navy had stopped and 
boarded a tealaden iraqiflagged freighter in the gulf of oman as 
part of the trade blockade against iraq 
any sign of rising tension in the middle east is likely to 
prompt an increase in both crude oil prices and inflation fears 
which is ordinarily bullish for gold 
but after gold prices dropped last week from more than 415 to 
less than 385 an ounce investors are leery about buying the 
metal said fredric tordella president of mtb banking corp a new 
yorkbased dealer of precious metals and foreign currency 
he said the markets aug 27 plunge of 2670 its steepest 
decline in seven years really shook a lot of people up not 
only their pocketbooks but their faith in the metals market and how 
its going to react to the current situation 
anne orton a vice president of the precious metals and currency 
dealer deak international inc agreed that last weeks big drop 
took a lot of steam out of the market

like the mythical icarus with his waxen wings 
ernest saunders was a high flier who crashed 
the former chief executive of guinness plc who earned 740000 
the year he engineered what was then britains largest corporate 
takeover has lost his job his wealth and finally his freedom 
his wife suffered a nervous breakdown and remains far away in 
switzerland all he has left is the loyalty of his three children 
and an unshakable insistence that he is innocent 
references to icarus cropped up in several newspapers late last 
month as saunders began a 5year jail term for organizing an 
illegal operation to ensure guinness successful takeover of 
distillers ltd a scottish whisky and gin maker 
judge sir denis henry summed up saunders as a very determined 
and singleminded man used to getting your own way and relentless 
in pursuit of it 
gerald ronson 51 chief of heron international plc and former 
stockbroker anthony parnes 44 were given 12 months and 2 years 
respectively for their part in the affair ronson also was fined a 
record 985 million 
financier sir jack lyons 74 convicted with them will be 
sentenced sept 25 
the four were found guilty of 19 charges ranging from stock 
manipulation and theft to false accounting in guinness hardfought 
504 billion takeover bid for distillers in 1986 
the court found the four had illegally inflated the price of 
guinness stock making the companys bid more attractive than a 
rival offer from the argyll supermarket group 
during the sixmonth trial at southwark crown court saunders 
54 denied knowing about any illegal payments to buyers of guinness 
stock 
but he said he had encouraged people institutions anyone i 
met to sell distillers shares to guinness rather than to argyll 
and to buy guinness shares because that was my job 
during seven days of testimony saunders testily defended his 
integrity characterizing the governments allegations as 
scurrilous disgraceful and disgusting 
benjamin guinness the chairman of the family brewing enterprise 
founded in dublin in 1759 had hired saunders in 1981 to reverse 
the companys falling fortunes and thats just what he did 
starting in june 1984 guinness expanded vigorously buying a 
chain of newsagencies the champneys group of health clubs 
natures best health products and the cranks health food restaurant 
chain 
in 1985 guinness quietly took over the scottish whisky makers 
arthur bell and sons 
between 1981 and 1985 guinness pretax profits rose to 170 
million from 823 million 
james saunders said guinness value on the stock market jumped 
to 56 billion by 1986 from 168 million in 1981 
but within a year of clinching the takeover of distillers in 
1986 saunders was out of a job and in police custody charged in 
britains biggest financial scandal 
he had been known in the city londons financial district 
as a brilliant marketing man and when trouble broke observers 
say the marketing man came to the fore 
so was born saunders the scapegoat said the observer a 
london sunday newspaper innocent ernest saunders the chairman 
and chief executive who knew nothing heard nothing and most 
certainly did nothing that could have caused him to face a trial 
this was the hero of nightmare a 270page book written by 
his 24yearold son james the book depicts saunders suffering a 
living hell after his arrest in may 1987 
the man accustomed to limousines rode the subway to court lived 
in a small flat and relied on legal aid to pay for his attorney 
james and his sister joanna 25 often came to court with their 
father saunders codefendants were supported by glamorous wives 
but carole saunders stayed in switzerland where she and her 
husband had gone in 1987 to recover from psychological stress 
the man i knew as energetic logical and lucid a 
perfectionist had changed into an intellectually broken man 
testified dr eric rochat who treated saunders 
saunders colleagues at guinness portrayed him as ambitious 
singleminded sometimes domineering and even ruthless 
olivier roux former guinness finance director said saunders 
was willing to delegate but in the distillers bid where it was 
never comfortable he was involved in all aspects and overseeing 
all aspects 
according to the times of london guinness workers had a 
nickname for ernest saunders they called the boss deadly 
ernest 
two inches taller than 6 feet he was every inch the grayhaired 
patrician with steady gaze and studied courtesy his club was the 
carlton the traditional hideaway for leaders of the conservative 
party 
the image obscured the roots of the man 
born ernst walter schleyer in vienna on oct 21 1935 he was 
the son of uly and hanni schleyer a jewish couple who fled from 
the nazis to england in 1938 
in britain they determined that ernst and his brother peter 
should be brought up as english boys according to james 
saunders ernst schleyer became ernest saunders at age 12 when he 
entered the prestigious st pauls school in london 
after t ap a line of boys clothes that carry an 
antihunting message is being yanked from the shelves at jc 
penney co incs 1330 stores the company said 
duncan muir public relations manager for the dallasbased 
retailer said it took the step after complaints about the clothes 
nationwide 
it is our company policy not to take a position one way or the 
other on these sorts of issues this is taking a position and an 
antiposition he said 
obviously this was pointed out to us and frankly we feel 
weve made a mistake all we can do is just withdraw it from the 
stores he said 
michigan united conservation clubs a sportsmens group was 
among those criticizing penney last week for carrying the clothing 
penney bought the environmental protection department line 
of clothing from a new york company h cotler co 
the head of the company howard cotler was in a meeting tuesday 
and did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment 
a card attached to each shirt in the line shows a sketch of a 
bird hunter aiming a shotgun over which a large red x has been 
marked under that are the words absolutely no hunting of wild 
and free animals while wearing this garment 
a similar message is stitched into an inside panel of the 
garment 
pants have a larger card with the message wild life protected 
by man surround the world with pure thoughts tags in the clothes 
indicate it was made in hong kong 
in a letter to the national rifle association last week cotler 
said the antihunting message was a marketing tool that had been 
discontinued 
he wrote that his company neither condemns nor supports 
antigun or antihunting legislation and it was trying to appeal 
to the environmental awareness of young people 
muir said he didnt know how many pieces of clothing were being 
taken off penney store shelves its in various stages of 
shipment a lot of it is still on its way and stores order on their 
own so its hard to say how many pieces are out there 
he declined to place a dollar figure on the penney order to 
cotler saying that was an internal inventory matter muir also 
said the retailer had not decided yet what to do with the clothes

the dollar was mixed in domestic trading after 
rising overseas tuesday but analysts were at a loss to explain the 
us currencys strength 
gold prices were also mixed rising in new york and dropping in 
europe and asia 
the dollar was up in early trading in new york following the 
trend sent on foreign markets but then lost some ground dealers 
said they had no explanation for the dollars healthier tone and 
shied away from predicting what course the us currency would take 
were trying to decide whether its a reversal of direction or 
what and we just dont know said robert ryan chief foreign 
exchange dealer with bank of new york co 
the dollar has slumped in recent weaks because of pessimism 
about the us economy and the effect the persian gulf crisis could 
have on it 
dealers said the markets were looking toward the scheduled 
release friday of the labor departments employment figures for 
august the markets expect the report to confirm that the economy 
is slowing down and reinforce arguments that us interest rates 
must come down 
many economists say the us economy is headed into a recession 
and the federal reserve will move to encourage lower rates but 
such a move would be a negative for the dollar which is supported 
by higher interest rates and has struggled lately to compete 
against currencies of nations with higher rates 
the dollar fell to 14340 japanese yen in new york compared 
with 143785 late friday us financial markets were closed monday 
for labor day 
in tokyo overnight the dollar rose to 14405 yen from 14355 at 
mondays close later in london it was quoted at 14355 yen 
the british pound was down against the dollar when compared with 
late fridays price falling to 18810 from 18905 in london

canadian dollars up from 115625 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late rates 
monday included 15843 german marks up from 15837 13170 swiss 
francs up from 13158 53105 french francs up from 53080 
17860 dutch guilders up from 17840 118225 italian lire up 
from 117900 and 11623 canadian dollars up from 11535 
on the commodity exchange in new york a troy ounce of gold rose 
140 to 38370 republic national bank later quoted a bid of 
38460 up 185 
overseas dealers said golds slide was partly triggered by a 
french newspaper report quoting a palestine liberation organization 
official as saying iraqi president saddam hussein was willing to 
negotiate iraqs withdrawal from kuwait in return for certain 
undertakings from the west 
gold is seen by some investors as a haven in times of 
international tension and its price often falls when tensions 
subside 
gold fell in london to a late bid of 38250 a troy ounce from 
387 late monday in zurich it fell to a closing bid of 38225 an 
ounce from 38750 late monday 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 174 an ounce to 38835

london earlier silver fell to a late bid of 475 a troy ounce 
down from 483 late monday

government said tuesday 
the us customs service said the payment would settle a civil 
case against the troy michbased retailer and its subsidiary k 
mart taiwan 
the settlement includes 3 million in unpaid duties and a 
penalty 
a customs service investigation found that k mart and its 
taiwanese affiliate manipulated prices of various textile articles 
imported from taiwan and south korea to evade the quota controls 
on certain classes of those articles the agency said in a 
statement 
the alleged infractions occurred between 1982 and 1985 
federal law limits quantities of many textile articles that can 
be imported from certain countries during a given period of time 
k mart spokesman robert stevenson said the dispute with the 
government centered on whether the company sufficiently disclosed 
its pricing practices during four years of very mixed regulatory 
signals from customs 
k mart at all times never intended any wrongful or mistaken 
activity stevenson said above all k mart intends to keep its 
record with the customs service clean of lengthy disputes and 
therefore agreed to settle this case

the troubled dutch electronics 
giant nv philips said tuesday it would discontinue several 
activities in its unprofitable components division and lay off 
4000 workers mostly in europe 
the company will halt further development of a large memory 
computer chip that it planned to use in a new portable computer 
series said philips spokesman jack reemers 
over the past few years philips has spent the equivalent of 
842 million on a megaproject much of which was devoted to 
developing the technology needed to make the onemegabit static 
random access memory sram chip 
reemers said philips would also suspend research on the sram 
chip being carried out with siemens of west germany and thomson sa 
of france in the cooperative jessi project however philips 
will remain active in other jessi projects 
philips said it had committed itself to spending 421 million a 
year for eight years to support jessi research on sram chips 
we are still very much involved in the jessi project said 
reemers 
philips president jan timmer warned at a special shareholders 
meeting in july that he planned to restructure several operations 
at philips including the components division he predicted losses 
for the year of more than 1 billion and 10000 layoffs 
philips also announced tuesday it would end production of direct 
driven liquid crystal display lcd boards which are used as 
screens for portable computers 
the moves have led analysts to speculate that philips is 
preparing to close down its computer operations but reemers did 
not say whether the company has such plans 
philips has unsuccessfully tried to save its ailing computer 
operations by linking its business with a partner 
reemers said philips will also halt work on semiconductor lasers 
in the netherlands and in taiwan 
dutch analysts gave mixed reactions to the news that the 
electronics giant was halting development of the sram technology 
costwise it is a good idea but strategywise i am not sure 
they used to regard development of memory chips as crucial to their 
products said an analyst who asked to remain anonymous 
what is the value of a giant electronics company that cant 
develop its own technology he added 
in 1989 philips components division had sales of about 62 
billion and employed a total of 75000 people 
of those 35000 worked in europe where most of the job losses 
will occur according to company spokesman reemers

charles keating jr was taken off the calendar in federal court 
here tuesday 
there were no operators on duty after hours to take calls at 
kirkland amp ellis the chicago firm representing keating the ots 
would say only that it might have a statement on the matter 
wednesday 
us district judge stephen v wilson had already granted a 
request by the ots for a temporary restraining order against 
keating who controlled lincoln savings amp loan association in 
irvine through his phoenixbased american continental corp 
the ots wanted wilson to convert the temporary restraining order 
to a preliminary injunction wilson had indicated he probably 
would there was no immediate rescheduling of the hearing 
keating already has complied with a key provision of the order 
that was to hand over to the ots an accounting of his personal 
finances in essence proving that he is broke as he contends 
a sticking point has been the ots order that he give notice 48 
hours before spending 5000 or more hes also been ordered not to 
transfer money out of the country 
regulators say lincolns failure may cost taxpayers 2 billion 
they are seeking about 42 billion from keating and five associates 
in connection with soured business deals at lincoln 
keating says that lincolns losses were compounded and 
exaggerated by the regulators who seized it he accuses them of 
making him a scapegoat to cover up their own bungling supervision 
of the thrift industry
