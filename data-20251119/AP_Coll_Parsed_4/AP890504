he was an ancient egyptian turncoat 
backbone of the pharaohs government one day and strong right arm 
of the conquering persians the next 
most of what the world knows of udjahorresnet comes from 
inscriptions on his statue in the vatican collection which boast 
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him 
but its a tale without an end the finale missing the last 
lines obscured 
now in the depths of a desert burial maze czechoslavak 
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic 
egypts dastardly personalities 
almost 60 feet down at the foot of a central shaft cut through 
soft petrified clay and filled with sand the team discovered a 
burial chamber 
what a shock to see his name udjahorresnet in such an 
unexpected place away from his home in the nile delta away 
from his persian connections said miroslav verner head of 
egyptology at charles university in prague 
it was thrilling verner said his name is what all 
egyptologists learn first when they study the persian takeover of 
egypt he was a dark personage a man known for his betrayal 
verner has been field director since 1976 of a czechoslavak 
archaeological mission in abusir an ancient burial and religious 
center 18 miles southwest of cairo 
mission scientists discovered a series of rubblefilled shafts 
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid 
ruin verners 10man team and colleagues from the egyptian 
antiquities organization began excavating last november 
udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death the 
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for 
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand and was more 
intricate than others found in egypt 
he was a trusted official of the 26thdynasty pharaoh psamtik 
iii then turned up as colonial administrator after cambyses of 
persia conquered egypt in 525 bc 
little is known of udjahorresnets later life 
the last we knew of him he was leading an egyptian army to 
help the persians under darius i cambyses son put down internal 
strife verner said then he disappeared from history the 
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was 
ever found 
that obscurity may be about to end 
in the limestone chamber at the bottom of the abusir shaft 
excavators found a megalithsized sarcophagus sheltering an inner 
coffin with decorated sides they bore the name udjahorresnet 
the chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles 
but verner said team members found five small statuettes with the 
names of udjahorresnet and his parents and a list of his titles 
since the 1960s the pyramiddomed sands of abusir have yielded 
several major finds to czech archaeologists the oldest papyri 
found in egypt the oldest hall with standing columns and several 
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty more than 4000 
years ago 
once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor the giza 
plateau abusir became one of egypts most exciting archaeological 
sites 
because of his important titles egypts chief physician and 
overseer of the royal navy and greek mercenaries udjahorresnet 
would have been a man in the know when the persian invasion 
came verner said 
history doesnt record his exact role the archaeologist 
said but the next thing we know after egypts defeat is that 
this man was part of the persian regime close to cambyses his man 
in egypt you might say highly rewarded for his new loyalty 
udjahorresnet even boasts that he put together egyptian 
titles for the new persian ruler he was a 100 percent quisling an 
opportunist 
his statue obtained by the vatican collection 200 years ago is 
thought to have left egypt with the roman emperor hadrian early in 
the second century 
hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who 
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa 
at tivoli near rome 
the architect of udjahorresnets tomb used sand in an 
hourglass effect first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then 
to seal the passages verner said the burial chambers roof 
contained holes with clay pots beneath which the last worker broke 
onebyone as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in 
from a shaft above the archaeologist said 
at least four graverobbing forays were made into the shaft the 
latest in medieval tims verner said robbers finally tunneled 
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using 
fire and water alternately to weaken it 
during their robberies the thieves lived in the shafts he 
said we know all about them from rubbish they left and the 
soot from their fires

a lottery in the ukrainian city of stakhanov 
didnt top the 115 million jackpot offered last week in 
pennsylvania but the winners seemed happy with their prizes rolls 
of toilet paper 
the newspaper literary gazette on wednesday told the story of 
ira a girl who bought three tickets and walked away with several 
rolls of toilet paper a towel and a small bowl 
the lottery tickets cost 50 kopeks about 81 cents more than 
the actual price of many of the prizes 
but dont forget that there are great shortages literary 
gazette said in the city of stakhanov except for the lottery 
one cannot get these goods 
soviet consumers are suffering through chronic shortages of many 
household goods and food products store shelves in moscow are 
barer than they have been in years and the situation in the 
provinces is worse thousands of people come to the capital every 
day to shop in its stores 
other lucky ticket holders in stakhanov won hens pigs goats 
detergent and bath soap the newspaper said it did not specify the 
date of the drawing 
one winner could not bring to his house everything he won in 
one hand he had a hen in the other there were four packets of 
laundry detergent the newspaper said 
the lucky people were bringing hardtoget products from the 
park it said seventy people won toilet paper and 50 of them 
boxes of detergent 
an old woman who didnt read about the lottery in the local 
newspaper was dismayed as she watched the people leaving with items 
that were not at the shops 
my god where are you getting this stuff the newspaper 
quoted her as asking a winner 
literary gazette said she had no idea that in the pockets of 
other happy people there were bars of soap and boxes of detergent 
according to lottery results the organizers sold 20000 tickets 
and pocketed about 3890 by giving away prizes that cost less than 
the tickets the newspaper did not explain how the organizers 
obtained the goods that were given away 
the lottery was held in honor of the 175th anniversary of 
stakhanov a city of 112000 people about 500 miles south of 
moscow it was founded in the 19th century as kadievka but renamed 
to honor coal miner alexei stakhanov who was held up by dictator 
josef stalin as a model worker for far exceeding average coal 
yields 
his feat in 1935 spawned a movement of workers who strove to 
emulate him as stalin led the soviet union on a course of crash 
industrialization stakhanov is located in the don basin coal 
mining region of the ukraine

young soldiers had reason 
to cheer along this dusty rutted road lined with the burnedout 
skeletons of tanks and trucks and bombedout mudandbrick villages 
they had wrested control of the road to the soviet border the 
lifeline for the capital kabul 
until a month ago it had been under the control of rebel 
commander akmed shah masoon and his jamaitiislami group who 
frequently clamp a stranglehold on the route and cut off essential 
supplies of food and fuel 
and the soldiers appeared more determined than ever to keep it 
from falling back into masoods hands 
if he tries to take it again well teach him a lesson he 
wont forget said one 30yearold soldier who gave his name 
only as capo 
on wednesday the government took a small contingent of foreign 
journalists along a 20mile stretch of the highway it was the 
first such trip since the soviet union 2 months ago pulled out the 
last of its troops who had been supporting the marxist afghan 
government 
along the road that winds through the majestic hindu kush 
mountains north toward the soviet border the soldiers stood beside 
their embattled roadside checkpoints and mountaintop observation 
posts as the small caravan of armored personnel carriers passed 
some of the soldiers saluted others waved or applauded for 
them it was their moment of triumph in the midst of widespread 
destruction nothing stood intact from years of shelling and 
bombing 
their success would not have been thought possible in 
midfebruary when the red army ended nine years of military 
involvement in afghanistan many people predicted the afghan armed 
forces would be plagued by mass defections those who did not 
switch sides according to one line of conjecture would not be 
able to stand on their own against the guerrillas armed and 
supported by the united states pakistan saudi arabia and china 
brig gen mohammad shafi said his group proved them wrong 
it needs no further explanation you can see for yourself 
said shafi who assumed commnd of the infantry unit that guards the 
road a few weeks before the final soviet pullout 
the village of baghemaidan about 65 miles north of kabul is 
proof of the devastation of 11 years of fighting between the afghan 
armed forces and the moslem guerrillas 
masood was responsible for this shafi said of the ruins 
that were once an ancient village carved in the mountain 
but some soldiers under his command disagree 
the russians did it said one soldier 
the soldier who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
said about 500 people were killed in one pulverizing raid on 
baghemaidan 
shafi estimated that 180 villages in the area had been destroyed 
over the years no one knows how many people were killed 
the united states earlier this year accused the soviet union of 
carpet bombing to clear the area before the final red army 
pullout on feb 15 the soviets denied it 
but in late january the soviet and afghan armed forces launched 
a threeday offensive with bombers artillery and tanks to clear 
the salang officials said at least 650 people were killed 
about four miles farther north the smell of smoke permeates the 
air and the roadside is cluttered with rows of destroyed tanks and 
supply trucks 
soldiers said the rebels had stopped the vehicles and demanded 
some kind of toll to pass through if they refused the driver was 
shot and the vehicle was doused with fuel and set ablazethe 
soldiers said 
a month ago the military moved in and cleared the area in a 
gunbattle that left at least 250 rebels dead masoods lieutenant 
abdul bashir was wounded but escaped shafi said 
about 400 government troops occupy the area now 
there hasnt been a major battle since then shafi said 
and he said the road has been open for columns of supply convoys 
to move toward kabul 
on tuesday night the general said 1800 trucks and tanks began 
moving slowly toward kabul and would reach the capital soon 
the convoy had not reached the city of 225 million by wednesday 
night 
soon he said it may not matter the government has been 
constructing another route to detour through the rebelcontrolled 
areas

a house subcommittee chairman vowed wednesday 
to hold up the release of more than 700 million in foreign aid for 
central america until the state department answers new questions 
about a secret quid pro quo deal between the reagan white house and 
honduras 
i dont expect to recommend any money for central america 
until we have some questions answered rep david obey dwis 
chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations said in a telephone interview 
i am not trying to suggest that i would withhold aid for 
central america if the answers we get are answers i dont like 
obey added but i do have an obligation to get those answers 
before we provide any additional assistance to the same countries 
documents released at the trial of former white house aide 
oliver l north show that on feb 19 1985 thenpresident ronald 
reagan approved a plan to give honduras incentives to support 
the nicaraguan contras after congress stopped all us military 
assistance to the rebels major elements of the plan were carried 
out documents showed 
a jury is deliberating norths guilt or innocence on 12 criminal 
charges including lying to congress and the attorney general about 
the irancontra affair misappropriating money and conspiring to 
defraud the treasury 
the north documents would seem to lead to some very troubling 
conclusions about the use of foreign aid to persuade aid recipients 
to provide foreign aid to the contras at a time when providing aid 
to the contras was against official american government policy 
obey said 
the congressman said he hoped to get answers from the state 
department anytime over the next two to three weeks 
senate foreign relations committee sources told the washington 
post wednesday that the committee probably would delay voting on 
the nomination of john negroponte as us ambassador to mexico 
until questions raised by the north trial were resolved 
negroponte who was us ambassador to honduras in 1985 
delivered a message from reagan to honduran president roberto suazo 
cordova that was part of the incentive plan negroponte also 
attended a march 1985 meeting between thenvice president bush and 
suazo that white house documents described as part of the plan 
the post reported in its thursday editions that senate sources 
said they doubted negropontes nomination was in danger but said 
democrats on the panel agreed to informally postpone the vote to 
elicit the administrations cooperation shedding light on the 
honduran deal

president desmond hoyte has rejected 
allegations by polands lech walesa that his socialist government 
has persecuted union leaders and clergy during a strike called to 
protest austerity measures 
hoyte said in a telegram to walesa that the solidarity trade 
union leader had been the victim of a cruel hoax or serious 
misrepresentation about the bitter monthlong strike by workers 
in this south american nations staterun sugar and bauxite 
industries 
i find your telex very puzzling government is not aware of 
any trade union leaders or priests being repressed in this 
country hoyte said in tuesdays message 
he asked walesa the 1983 nobel peace laureate for more 
information about his allegations 
walesa had sent hoyte a telex friday calling for negotiations 
with the strikers and asking him to stop the repression against 
the union leaders and the priests who are with them 
the strike is to protest austerity measures adopted under 
provisions of a 115 million aid package from the international 
monetary fund 
protesters have burned government buildings and firebombed a 
school and two rural courts during nationwide demonstrations in 
which police have arrested about 100 people 
hoyte said in a may day speech that he doubted if walesa 
understood english the language spoken in guyan or could find the 
country on a map

dont sell your palladium futures just yet cold 
fusion is not dead 
physicists nearly succeeded this week in sending cold fusion 
from the laboratory to the library file under science fiction 
at an american physical society meeting in baltimore they 
announced in a chorus that they had failed to confirm the 
university of utahs claims of fusion in a jar 
the utah chemists had misinterpreted their data the physicists 
said that was putting it charitably 
to which university of utah vice president john brophy 
responded what about the positive results from stanford texas aampm 
and case western reserve universities 
researchers at those institutions said wednesday they are still 
getting positive results something is going on they are hesitant 
to call it fusion but they cant make it go away 
there are plenty of positive results to talk about said 
charles martin of texas aampm 
we stand convinced said robert huggins at stanford we 
dont see anything wrong with our experiments and we would be glad 
to have other people replicate it under identical circumstances 
at case western uziel landau revised his figures slightly but 
his results remain positive on friday he said his device was 
producing 8 percent to 30 percent more energy than was going into 
it wednesday he said the energy output was 10 percent over the 
input 
the utah scientists claim is far more extravagant they say 
they are getting 10 times as much energy out as they are putting 
in according to brophy 
some of the strongest of this weeks attacks on the utah 
research came from the massachusetts institute of technology 
yet a lone physicist there is holding on tight to his theory 
explaining how fusion is possible in the utah experiment 
im not withdrawing my theory peter hagelstein said 
wednesday through a spokesman 
he put forth his theory on the basis that the ponsfleischmann 
experiment had some validity said the spokesman eugene mallove 
the chemists chance to make their case comes monday night at a 
meeting in los angeles of the electrochemical society the stanford 
and texas aampm groups will be there that could be 
makeitorbreakit for cold fusion 
stanley pons of the university of utah and martin fleischmann of 
the university of southampton in england who kicked off the fusion 
sweepstakes with a press conference on march 23 will be there 
they claim to generate energy with palladium and platinum 
electrodes dipped in a beaker of socalled heavy water it is made 
of oxygen and deuterium a form of hydrogen with a neutron in the 
nucleus 
unlike the meeting of the physicists the electrochemists 
meeting will be closed to the press according to tradition said 
vh branneky the executive director of the electrochemical 
society 
all the confusion could be erased if pons and fleischmann would 
reveal the details of their experiment which they have not done 
in terms of the original experiment theres no reason not to 
release all the information they know said brophy if there 
were confirmation they wouldnt be taking all this guff 
on the other hand they probably will not write up details of 
their work until june brophy said their choice at this time is 
to get additional data 
the worldwide swell of excitement over cold fusion recalls the 
recent excitement over hightemperature superconductivity with one 
important difference 
all of the important findings in the superconductivity scramble 
were confirmed within days at laboratories around the world that 
has not been the case with cold fusion 
science magazine this week recalled a 1972 incident in which 
three university of utah scientists claimed to have invented an 
xray laser most other labs that tried couldnt reproduce the 
results but a few did 
ultimately said science the utah researchers were proven 
wrong the disproven results were referred to as the utah 
effect 
if cold fusion fizzles said science the utah effect will 
have struck again

police said they found the body of an infant 
wednesday night in their search for a missing 6weekold girl whose 
reported abduction last week mirrored the disappearance of her 
sister in 1986 
the body was in a plastic garbage bag in a metal trash bin near 
an old lock and dam across the mississippi river from this 
community said st charles mo county sheriff ed uebinger 
a fisherman had noticed someone acting a little bit strange 
put something into the garbage can uebinger said 
the sheriff said he did not know whether the baby was 6weekold 
heather sims of alton who was reported abducted last saturday by 
her mother paula sims an autopsy was planned for thursday morning 
alton police said heathers father robert sims called police 
saying he had learned of the discovery from a tv news report said 
sgt billy lawrence he asked when someone was going to come and 
talk to him lawrence said 
robert and paula sims told police a masked man approached mrs 
sims while she was taking out the trash saturday the man forced 
her back into the home knocked her unconscious and took the baby 
the couple told police 
the reported circumstances of heathers disappearance are 
strikingly similar to the june 1986 disappearance of loralei sims 
the couples first child the couple reported an armed intruder 
entered their former home in brighton and took the 13dayold 
infant 
a week later the remains of an infant believed to have been 
loralei were found near that home the cause of death was not 
determined 
during their investigation into the 1986 case investigators 
conducted complete background studies of the parents and never 
found anything said jersey county sheriff frank yocom 
the couple cooperated in extensive interviews at that time 
yocom said 
we looked at everything we found no history of mental 
problems no children by a prior marriage no insurance 
nothing he said 
in the 1986 case the family was never contacted by anyone 
claiming to have abducted the child and never had a ransom demand 
yocom said 
we were prepared for it but we never got a note or a call 
he said 
a search tuesday of property the parents owned in rural brighton 
proved fruitless on wednesday sgt rick mccain altons chief of 
detectives said there were new and encouraging leads in the case 
but declined to discuss them

thousands of students swept past police lines and 
into tiananmen square on thursday in a march for freedom and 
democracy celebrating the 70th anniversary of the first student 
movement in china 
policemen who had ringed the vast expanse were unable to hold 
back the several thousand students from at least eight universities 
in the citys northeast who surged into the square the symbolic 
center of power in china 
a crowd of about 1000 onlookers also ran into the square 
climbing on the monument to revolutionary heroes that has been a 
focal point of prodemocracy protests launched by students more 
than two weeks ago 
another 4000 students from 10 beijing universities and five 
groups from outoftown schools were heading to the square from the 
west they had left campuses at 830 am with a burst of 
firecrackers and the bang of a gong 
the students had said tuesday they would march unless the 
countrys communist leaders recognized their independent student 
organization on wednesday the government refused and said the 
square would be closed thursday 
a group of 300 journalists meanwhile held a protest at the 
official xinhua news agency calling for a free press and some of 
them broke away to join the student march carrying banners calling 
for press freedoms 
a closed press does not contribute to stability said one 
banner 
as they marched through streets lined by thousands of cheering 
workers the students met less police resistance than in previous 
marches 
the students carried dozens of red and white banners calling for 
a free press and democratic reforms some wore headbands saying 
mom im not wrong 
most students met little police resistance when at about 930 
am they broke through the first line of several hundred police 
blocking the street 
but several thousand students from beijing normal college 
overcame strong resistance from several hundred police by shoving 
their way through as surrounding crowds yelled let them 
through and hurry up 
students from the peoples university pushed a threewheeled 
cart holding a loudspeaker that blared slogans they also carried a 
large red banner painted with a bright green dragon and the words 
science democracy freedom and human rights in each corner 
in contrast to last weeks march on tiananmen square when 
students were angered by the governments opposition to their 
demands for democracy and freedom thursdays march commemorating 
the anniversary of the 1919 may fourth student movement had an air 
of defiant celebration 
last thursday about 150000 students and supporters had staged 
a 20mile march through the square and the capitals streets 
today is a holiday and we are here to remember may fourth 
said one student 
thousands of workers had defied government warnings that they 
would be fired if they attended the march said one government 
employee 
but this is the first time in 40 years such a big movement for 
democracy has occurred ill just show up at work tomorrow and see 
what happens he said on condition of anonymity 
people leaned out of bus windows and pushed into the crowds to 
snatch leaflets handed out by the students the leaflets explained 
the students goals and called on all sections of society to arise 
if this develops i think china has hope said one bystander 
at one corner crowds jeered as a police loudspeaker said 
repeatedly please everybody obey the peoples police uphold

some members of congress are clearly curious 
whether providing a pay raise for federal judges will supply enough 
political cover to vote one for themselves as well 
that was the one clear lesson on wednesday when william h 
rehnquist became the first chief justice to testify before congress 
in 50 years rehnquist who makes 115000 a year appealed for 30 
percent pay raises and annual costofliving increases for himself 
and all federal judges 
he appeared before a veritable hotbed of support for the 
controversial idea of boosting top federal pay the house committee 
on post office and civil service 
among members of the committee the 51 percent pay raise lost by 
just 129 on feb 7 in the house as a whole that day that 
increase for congress the judges and top executive branch 
officials was defeated 38048 
weve felt very lonely on this issue said rep gary 
ackerman dny who voted for the pay raise those of us in 
this branch are taking all the heat 
chairman william ford dmich who also voted for the pay 
raise ended the session with special thanks to rehnquist you 
give us credibility in a way that almost no one else could ford 
said 
before then four members ackerman and three who voted against 
the raise connie morella rmd patricia schroeder dcolo and 
tom sawyer dohio all asked whether in proposing a judges 
raise rehnquist was advocating that the judges be treated 
differently from their traditional pay equals in congress and the 
top executive offices 
first the chief justice said he had no position 
but by the time the question was asked a fourth time rehnquist 
said that just as good a case had been made for raises in congress 
and the executive as for judges he said it was well within the 
bounds of propriety for them to get 30 percent raises as well 
it fell to ackerman to make the point explicitly the feeling 
here is that if theres ever going to be a pay raise for the 
legislative branch we have to stay coupled with the judiciary 
so they threw him every argument against the raise that they had 
heard to see how good his defenses sounded 
what about voters who say that officials sought their offices 
voluntarily knowing the salary in advance 
rehnquist yes but we didnt know that inflation would eat away 
at our purchasing power 
judicial leaders predicted judges would quit if the raise was 
defeated but they havent is that danger real 
rehnquist more and more have quit in recent years but even 
now not a major or even a large minor percentage of the judges 
and the big one as stated by frank mccloskey dind one of 
several who made this point 
a 10000ayear job or a 12000ayear job in morgan county 
ind would be considered the job of a lifetime the people there 
who make those salaries cant understand how you cant get by on 
89500 that is the salary of a federal district judge 
rehnquist replied i have no good answer but he added i 
never felt i wanted to go to a doctor who made no more than i did 
i wanted to go to a good doctor 
other committee members kept touching on this argument at 
another point rehnquist responded you want the best doctor 
dont you want the best judge 
rehnquist said he worried that partners in big city law firms 
the highest paid lawyers in america were no longer coming onto 
the bench but then he added this observation 
theres always going to be a large number of partners in big 
city law firm who dont want to be federal judges because they 
dont want to make the financial sacrifices if youre interested 
in money and you now make 250000 if the district judges pay 
goes from 89500 to 115000 it isnt going to influence you in 
the least rehnquist said our pay raise is not going to affect 
that 
to get the very best you have to offer not salaries that are 
competitive with private practice but something that lets them live 
a reasonably comfortable life and educate their kids 
but rehnquist acknowledged getting mail on that point including 
a letter from someone earning 25000 to 30000 with a mortgage 
who wanted to educate their kids too and wanted to know why i 
wanted 150000 
at the end it was anybodys guess how many members thought 
rehnquists explanations would satisfy their constituents and 
provide political cover for a congressional raise 
but all morning no one mentioned an argument available to 
members of congress unlike judges who get the same pay they have 
to maintain two homes and commute between them

kenneth l adelman who was the reagan 
administrations arms control director says the united states 
should never negotiate a reduction in shortrange nuclear missiles 
with the soviet union 
for two reasons adelman said wednesday in an interview 
they have been an essential element in deterrence since the early 
1960s no 2 there is no way to verify whether the missiles will 
have nuclear or conventional or chemical munitions 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has demanded that the united 
states negotiate reductions in the missiles with the soviet union 
kohl is also resisting us and british efforts to more than triple 
the range of natos lance missiles to about 250 miles 
but bush on wednesday ruled out negotiations with the soviets on 
shortrange nuclear missiles the white house put the best face on 
the dispute by calling it a sign of natos vitality 
adelman who was the us arms control director from 1983 to 
1987 said the bush administration should propose to kohl that the 
missiles be modernized and then the us arsenal of shortrange 
weapons could be reduced by about 1000 from its current level of 
4500 
but adelman who was an enthusiastic supporter of the 1987 
treaty to ban us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
said the united states should never negotiate to reduce or 
another kohl goal to eliminate the lances 
never adelman said never under any circumstance it is 
unwise and its unverifiable 
he said the united states would comply with a ban on shortrange 
missiles but adelman said we dont always know if the soviets 
would comply and it is impossible to distinguish between nuclear 
and nonnuclear tactical missiles 
paul h nitze a senior adviser on arms control in the reagan 
administration told the new york times this week that president 
bush was making a mistake in refusing to open talks with the 
soviets on shortrange nuclear missiles 
nitze said such negotiations would provide an opportunity to 
eliminate a large soviet advantage 
adelman said he disagreed but added there is nothing wrong in 
his speaking out on the subject 
since leaving his post adelman has been writing teaching and 
serving as vice president of the institute for contemporary 
studies a public policy research group in san francisco 
with bushs summit meeting with 15 allied leaders looming at 
months end efforts by norway and canada to broker a compromise 
did not meet with immediate success through his spokesman marlin 
fitzwater the president insisted the lance missiles must be 
upgraded to deter soviet attack 
bush told visiting norwegian prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland that entering into arms control negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear forces with the soviet union would be a 
mistake fitzwater said 
after a onehour session in the oval office mrs brundtland 
stressed a need to find common ground with kohl 
canada meanwhile approached nato members with a compromise 
that called for negotiations with the soviets on shortrange 
nuclear weapons with the understanding all lances would not be 
uprooted and the warsaw pacts edge in conventional forces would be 
erased the deal would permit modernizing the missiles first 
mrs brundtland told reporters in a white house driveway that a 
solution would be found before the may 2930 summit or at least 
when the leaders are gathered in brussels 
but fitzwater was dubious we will continue to discuss it 
he said of the missile dispute but we are very firm in our 
position 
on capitol hill members of congress warned that the united 
states might reconsider keeping troops in europe if west germany 
persisted in pushing for removal of the lances 
members of the senate armed services committee told defense 
secretary dick cheney they had serious concerns about the west 
german position 
i think if the west german people have come to the conclusion 
they can place more faith and reliance on mr gorbachevs words and 
assurances than they can upon sound nato strategy than it would be 
very difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forces 
we have in europe under those circumstances said sen william 
cohen rmaine 
another republican sen slade gorton of washington said that 
if the missiles were eliminated and the 324000 us military 
personnel in germany were placed at risk the administrations 
policy should be that a substantial percentage of troops be 
brought home and we allow west germany greater responsibility of 
their defense 
cheney who had come to capitol hill to discuss the fiscal 1990 
defense budget cautioned against overdramatizing the nature of 
the current differences within nato 
but cheney said that if a nato consensus called for no 
shortrange missiles i as secretary of defense would have 
something of a stomach ache

the public affairs lobbying group that joined 
rep newt gingrich last year in asking the house ethics committee 
to investigate speaker jim wright now is asking for an outside 
counsel to investigate gingrich 
fred wertheimer president of the lobbying group common cause 
made the request for an independent counsel in a letter wednesday 
to rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the committee 
the use of outside counsel helps ensure that the results of an 
inquiry are credible to and accepted by the public wertheimer 
said 
gingrich rga charged that common cause usually associated 
with liberal causes is trying to get back in the good graces of 
democrats who were upset when the group helped bring about 
investigation of wright dtexas 
there are 15 to 20 members who have had pretty powerful 
allegations of real scandals made against them in the press and im 
in the middle of being smeared gingrich said i find it 
bizarre that common cause would jump past those scandals and ask 
for an investigation of the guy whos being smeared the 
whistleblower 
rep bill alexander dark filed a formal complaint with the 
committee last month accusing gingrich of 10 apparent violations of 
house rules in the operation of a limited partnership set up to 
promote window of opportunity a book written in 1984 by 
gingrich his wife marianne gingrich and david drake 
according to the allegations the 21 partners who put up 5000 
each in the book ended up with a tax writeoff because the publisher 
lost money 
mrs gingrich was paid 11500 for her work as the controlling 
general partner she also was given a 2 percent ownership interest 
in the organization although she did not invest any of her own 
money 
while he had no direct financial stake in the partnership 
gingrich was paid 1320 in expenses by the partnership when he 
traveled to promote the book and he and his wife each have 
received 12018 in royalties

grain sales to the soviet union and japan 
capture attention because of the countries and quantities involved 
but an agriculture department report says the third world offers 
strong export potential as well 
unlike the soviet union and japan however the third world 
countries have little money to spend for food to keep pace with 
expanding populations 
these are 55 lessdeveloped countries listed by the united 
nations food and agriculture organization most have food 
shortfalls that are made up by imports often in the form of aid 
from richer nations 
gregory gajewski and ray nightingale of the departments 
economic research service say us farmers will have to rely mainly 
on larger exports in order to handle increased production of cereal 
grains and policy changes by the poorer nations themselves could 
help create greater demand 
the 55 countries on the faos lessdeveloped list currently 
are players in international cereals markets but only on 
concessional terms the two economists said in the may issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine yet about 19 billion people live 
in these countries accounting for about twofifths of the worlds 
population 
but these countries are poor and many have stagnant economies 
the report said in addition some are overburdened with 
international debt that saps their ability to grow and import 
agricultural commodities 
other have government regulations that depress prices paid to 
local farmers so that urban consumers may benefit from lower food 
prices the report said these regulations hinder the 
development of a marketoriented farm economy and cut farmers 
incentives to produce 
gajeweski and nightingale said there is historical evidence that 
farmled development can boost a poor countrys imports of 
agricultural commodities 
for example they said south korea now imports more food each 
year from the united states than it ever received in us food aid 
investment in rural infrastructure roads dams irrigation 
projects tends to boost incomes across the board in developing 
countries 
as incomes rise people increase their demands for better 
food including meats and processed products the report said 
increased meat demand consequently leads to greater demand for 
feed grains so on balance demand for agricultural imports 
rises 
gajewski and nightingale said that food aid increases labors 
diet and productivity and has had a positive influence on 
economic growth in some countries 
but food aid can hamper a recipient countrys longterm 
prospects if it is not linked to policy changes they said 
massive inflows of free or subsidized food weaken domestic farm 
prices and reduce local farmers incentives 
despite last years drought in north america global food 
production is not expected to be the longterm problem the 
report said but the distribution of food has been and will 
continue to be the major concern 
looking at some of the recent trouble spots the report said 
that on the basis of per capita food supplies shortfalls are most 
pronounced in jamaica costa rica tunisia cape verde swaziland 
and liberia 
in contrast eight countries that once had serious shortfalls 
now have sufficient domestic production or are expected to import 
enough cereals to maintain usual consumption without depleting 
grain inventories the report said these countries are 
burkina faso chad gambia mali niger sudan uganda and zambia

a group of farm state lawmakers has proposed 
legislation to establish a 60 million soybean research and 
promotion program financed by a levy on domestic soybean production 
the proposal which was developed by the american soybean 
association would provide for a nationwide checkoff similar to 
those imposed on other commodities including dairy pork and beef 
producers 
money from the proposed mandatory assessment would go to pay for 
farmerrun programs to expand exports develop new uses for 
soybeans and promote soybean products through a coordinated 
national advertising campaign 
the legislation calls for the overall program to be administered 
by a system of state and national boards made up of soybean 
producers 
this program is and will be farmerbred farmerfed and 
farmerled james lee adams of camilla ga president of the 
american soybean association said wednesday 
at a news conference sen david pryor dark said the 
legislation would give american soybean farmers a war chest of 
their own to combat promotional and research efforts of foreign 
competitors including brazilian soybean producers and malaysian 
palm oil growers 
sen christopher bond rmo said the goal of the legislation 
was to restore america as the worlds preeminent supplier of 
soybeans 
rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the house agriculture 
subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains said lawmakers 
would act on the measure as quickly as feasible 
currently 26 states have soybean promotion programs that 
generate about 14 million to 15 million in total but adams said 
a patchwork approach of voluntary assessments was inadequate 
when our competitors have begun to outsell and outinvest us 
the proposed rate of assessment would be onehalf percent of the 
net market value of soybeans sold by a farmer 50 cents for every 
100 in sales half the collections would go to state programs 
if the legislation is approved by congress the assessment would 
be implemented and then a producer referendum would be held in 18 
months to 36 months to determine whether it should be continued 
current state checkoffs would be reinstituted if producers reject 
the national assessment

the san diego yacht club asked a state appeals 
court wednesday to overturn a judges ruling that awarded the 
americas cup to a new zealand boating club after septembers 
mismatched yacht race off san diego 
the west coast sailors said that the ruling march 28 by state 
supreme court justice carmen ciparick was improper because the 
judge invented a rule that didnt exist and illegally ordered the 
cup forfeited 
the judge said the san diego yacht club had violated the 
spirit of the race by using a 60foot catamaran to defend the cup 
against the mercury bay boating clubs singlehulled yacht which 
is about 90 feet long at the waterline 
the judge called the contest which the san diegans won a 
gross mismatch and ordered the 138yearold silver cup turned 
over to the new zealanders 
oral arguments before the state supreme courts appellate 
division have not been scheduled yet in their filing wednesday 
the san diegans pointed to ciparicks phrase saying the boats 
should be somewhat evenly matched 
they said there was no such provision in the deed of gift a 
document that sets the rules for americas cup races 
the san diego club argued that the forfeiture was drastic and 
unfair and asked the appeals court to reverse it

certainty of punishment is more important than 
severity of punishment in dealing with drug offenders drug czar 
william j bennett says 
i am for severe penalties particularly when a drug crime is 
severe but what you have to have is certain punishment bennett 
said wednesday you shouldnt make certain punishment hostage to 
severe punishment 
it would be better in many situations to have everyone thats 
convicted of drug use to go to jail for a week than to just get 
a third of them going for six months he said 
bennett made his comments to reporters after telling several 
hundred members of the washington metropolitan area interreligious 
coalition that those guilty of drug offenses must believe that 
punishment is inevitable 
as long as they dont the deterrent effect of incarceration 
is neutralized he said 
the trend in recent years has been toward longer sentences for 
crimes and bennett denied later that he was calling for reduced 
sentences for drug offenders including what he termed socalled 
casual users 
but he cited the practice in phoenix as an example of where 
short sentences have the desired impact on those who break the law 
in that city police are arresting drug users many of them 
middleclass and putting them in jail for a weekend thats all 
just a weekend he said for a lot of middleclass users that 
is plenty of time they are cured after one weekend in the 
slammer 
bennetts speech an overview of his thinking as he compiles his 
national drug control strategy a report on which is due in early 
september also called for parents to be made more responsible 
legally for their childrens transgressions 
he cited in this case the example of toledo ohio where 
parents are brought before the juvenilejustice court and made to 
answer for the actions of their children through civil penalties 
this policy establishes the principle that parents must 
bear responsibility for the behavior and the activities of minors 
in their charge bennett said minors who are nonaddicted 
users must be taught early on that they cannot behave with 
impunity and parents who have effectively turned them loose must 
learn why the social contract demands that they oversee and control 
the implses of their children 
asked later if that included jailing parents for offenses 
committed by their children bennett said that should occur only in 
extreme cases 
bennett acknowledged that the federal government was unlikely to 
get involved in imposing such regulations as the weekend jailings 
and the arrests of parents and said such actions would be for the 
state and local governments to carry out 
the issues were raised he said because local officials have 
asked him repeatedly to disseminate whatever good ideas are being 
tried out around the country to combat illegal drugs 
bennetts speech made only hours after his wife gave birth to 
their second son also addressed rehabilitation of drug users and 
offenders 
we dont know as much as wed like to about how to treat drug 
use and sadly many of our profoundly goodspirited efforts at 
treatment have failed to pan out he said but what we do know 
is this successful programs and treatment almost always force the 
addict to confront and internalize the fact of his addiction 
bennett said it may take confrontation primarily from the 
family for a drug user to recognize that there will be dire 
consequences for him if he fails to end his addiction 
but he said he realizes that rehabilitation is the wrong term 
to use for many drug offenders because the addict never had a 
normal home life to begin with and good habits must be instilled 
for the first time

the plaintiff serving as his own counsel before 
the state supreme judicial court was younger than most attorneys 
hes 18 
harvard freshman josh gerstein believed to be the youngest 
person to argue before the states highest court appeared 
wednesday to protest what he says was a violation of the states 
open meeting law 
gerstein contended the weston school committee violated the law 
when it hired a superintendent in 1988 
gerstein said he spent more than 100 hours preparing for the 
case he submitted a 20page brief his arguments before five 
jurists took only five minutes but he said he was a lot more 
nervous than when he argued the case before a lower court last 
year 
its an interesting issue its dealing with how much access 
the public has to government gerstein told reporters after the 
hearing 
he said he was forced to skip russian class 
after gerstein filed his complaint in 1988 he was joined by the 
middlesex county district attorneys office an attorney from the 
office also argued on behalf of the complaint wednesday 
gerstein was a senior at weston high school when he first 
protested what he saw as insufficient student input in the 
selection of a superintendent 
weston school officials contend they were entitled to close 
three rounds of screening including interviews to the public 
gerstein and the district attorney say the law only allows the 
first round of interviews to be closed 
gerstein said he has nothing against the superintendent chosen 
by the committee meredith jones but he said he did not know if 
she was more or less qualified than the other 100 original 
candidates since students were excluded 
a ruling is expected within four months 
despite his performance wednesday gerstein said he does not 
plan a career in law he is majoring in government and wants to be 
a journalist

the environmental protection agency says it 
cant assure that pesticides banned in the united states wont show 
up on imported food 
the head of epas division on pesticides and toxic substances 
said wednesday that pesticide residue on imported food could be a 
huge problem 
there is no simple way of finding out the pesticide usage of 
countries exporting food to the united states said victor kim 
kims comments came during a hearing of the house subcommittee 
on environment energy and natural resources which has jurisdiction 
over the epa 
rep mike synar rokla chairman of the subcommittee blasted 
the epa for not having a better system for informing foreign 
countries about the dangers of pesticides they buy from american 
companies 
the united states carries an environmental responsibility and 
a moral obligation to ensure that foreign governments through the 
world are provided with the best information on assistance with 
and if necessary protection from unsafe pesticides said synar 
to date the epa has failed miserably in fulfilling this 
responsibility 
he said the agency also has failed to do its job in protecting 
the american food supply by informing agencies like the agriculture 
department that countries selling food to the united states use 
pesticides banned here 
synar displayed memos from agriculture department inspectors 
about two shipments of honduran beef that were contaminated with 
chlordane a chemical believed to cause cancer 
our reports show that chlordane is made only in the united 
states said synar noting however that it is not allowed to be 
sold here as pesticide 
most of the beef in the shipments was sold to grocery stores 
ground up and purchased by consumers before it was discovered 
under questioning from synar epa officials admitted that they 
havent followed their own suggestions for helping other countries 
understand better the dangers of pesticides made in the united 
states 
linda fisher epa assistant administrator for policy planning 
and evaluation said the agency was aware that more had to be done 
but when presented with an internal epa memo dated april 17 
1987 outlining improvements that should be made she said none of 
the recommendations had been followed 
she assured synar the epa would act soon on the recommendations 
and those of international negotiators trying to establish a 
worldwide policy for pesticide use 
according to a report from the general accounting office an 
investigative arm of congress the epa doesnt have any procedures 
for deciding when to notify foreign countries about pesticides that 
the united states has decided are dangerous to human health 
the report also said epa doesnt have any standards for 
determining when actions taken against pesticides in this country 
are significant enough to warn another nation 
the agency is considering improvements to its present 
procedures including those recommended by gao said fisher 
under us law pesticides that are banned or unregistered 
domestically can be sold abroad if foreign buyers provide a 
statement saying they understand that the product is outlawed in 
the united states

the bush administration issued a stern warning 
to japan on fair trade at the same time that it eased what had 
threatened to become a fullblown trade war with europe 
the european agreement announced late wednesday concerned 
american beef containing growth hormones us trade representative 
carla hills called the partial settlement with the 12nation 
european community a positive step toward deescalating the 
dispute between the united states and its largest trading partner 
in a separate trade dispute involving telecommunications mrs 
hills released a target list of japanese products which could face 
100 percent duties unless japan does more to open its market for 
car telephones and business radios to american companies 
the threatened tariffs would effectively double the price of the 
japanese products included in the proposed list are some of the 
most popular japanese electronic products including color 
televisions video recorders and photocopying machines 
the agreement with the ec will affect about 15 percent of the 
96 million in annual us beef sales to europe the other 85 
percent of the market will remain closed pending further 
negotiations us officials said in announcing the settlement 
the agreement follows the recommendations of a task force of 
officials from both sides 
under the agreement us beef producers who wish to export beef 
not treated with growth hormones to europe will be allowed to do so 
this partial resolution will cover high quality grades of beef 
being shipped to europe but will not cover the other 85 percent of 
beef trade which includes socalled variety meats such as 
livers tongues and kidneys 
in return for this action mrs hills said the united states 
will reduce the retaliatory tariffs imposed by america against 
imports from the european community 
the tariffs which took effect on jan 1 covered boneless beef 
ham prepared tomatoes tomato sauce instant coffee fruit juices 
fermented alcoholic beverages and pet food 
those 100 percent tariffs which covered 96 million in european 
food shipments to america will be reduced by the amount of 
american beef which is allowed in under the new agreement mrs 
hills said 
mrs hills said that the task force studying the situation will 
continue searching for ways to include more american beef and will 
report back before june 15 
us officials have insisted that there is nothing harmful about 
the hormones being used to fatten beef they contend that the 
european action was an illegal trade barrier which was masquerading 
as a health issue 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said that while the us 
position was unchanged on the health question the administration 
did not want to stand in the way of producers who are willing and 
able to meet the ecs requirements for hormonefree beef 
under the agreement american ranchers who want to export 
hormonefree beef to europe will have to meet a set of requirements 
drawn up by european officials who will also establish a 
monitoring system to insure that the beef being shipped does not 
contain hormones 
release of the target list of japanese products facing possible 
100 percent duties stems in large part from complaints by the 
motorola co the principal american maker car telephones and 
business radios it contends that it has been denied access to the 
japanese market denying it potential sales of about 400 million a 
year 
a final list of products which could be subject to the higher 
tariffs will be drawn up after a hearing scheduled for may 24 that 
list will be selected from the broader one released on wednesday 
mrs hills said the threatened american retaliation could be 
avoided if the japanese make meaningful concessions to end the 
dispute

the air force logistics command has been doing sophisticated 
tests because many of the cracks cant be seen by the eye said 
pastor theyre very minute the concern is if a crack exists at 
takeoff it has the potential of increasing and potentially 
causing wing failure 
aircraft with cracks will be repaired or modified by a team from 
the air national guards sacramento califbased air logistics

the opposition closed its 
presidential campaign with some supporters predicting victory in 
sundays vote over the handpicked candidate of gen manuel antonio 
noriega or bloodshed 
count the votes or count the dead read one of the 
opposition coalitions signs wednesday at a rally attended by 
100000 flagwaving people on via espana in downtown panama city 
president bush opposition candidates and others predict that 
noriega the defense forces chief and panamas de facto ruler will 
steal the elections the government promises clean elections 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara said that if 
the public will is denied through voterigging panamanians will 
march in defense of liberty 
never again endara said in reference to noriega will the 
will of one man be above the will of the panamanian people 
the opposition candidates say there is no hope of democracy in 
panama as long as noriega indicted in florida last year on charges 
of drug smuggling and money laundering remains in power noriega 
has denied the charges 
opposition supporters snakedanced through the crowd wednesday 
night with a black coffin pasted with a smiling picture of noriega 
and a pineapple attached atop pineapple face a derogatory 
name the opposition uses for noriega refers to his rough 
complexion 
the progovernment coalition closes its presidential campaign 
tonight with a rally its ticket is headed by carlos duque jaen a 
close business associate of noriega 
the central issue of the campaign has been noriega and not 
panamas protracted economic and social problems 
the opposition contends government workers representing about 
20 percent of the labor force are being pressured by noriega 
forces to attend the rally tonight and that the government will 
truck thousands into the capital to swell the ranks 
on sunday voters will choose a president two vice presidents 
67 national legislators and 510 precinct representatives 
panama has about 22 million people and about 12 million 
registered voters at a news conference wednesday second 
opposition vice presidential candidate guillermo ford said sundays 
vote is the last peaceful opportunity for change 
said first vice presidential candidate ricardo arias calderon 
there are thousands here who have never known liberty but are 
here to fight for it 
added ford i was born free i am not free i will be free on 
may 7 
rivers of people carrying colorful party flags poured into the 
rally area wednesday 
fireworks burst in the muggy air overhead and enthusiastic 
opposition supporters fueled a street fire with progovernment 
candidates flags pulled from trees and lampposts 
speeches by ford and endara were broken up once when the crowd 
panicked after opposition security guards moved in on people 
including some journalists trying to climb a fence protecting the 
candidates 
at least one person was carried from the stampede but did not 
appear to be seriously injured others were knocked to the ground 
but walked away without assistance 
there was more panic when opposition supporters identified an 
alleged government informer or toad and chased him through the 
crowd beating him with sticks until he escaped 
many signs at the rally addressed the issue of vote rigging 
arias said a 29 percent jump in voter rolls since the 1984 
elections was unexplainable in the same period there has been 
only a 16 percent increase in population 
the opposition contends the difference represents duplicate 
voting cards and other measures issued to give progovernment 
candidates an edge government officials say the increase is the 
result of improved registration methods 
after noriega was indicted thenpresident eric arturo delvalle 
tried to oust him but the general forced out delvalle 
noriega and the government accuse the opposition of being 
lackeys of the united states which has imposed economic sanctions 
on panama as part of its attempt to drive him from power 
noriega says the united states is trying to get rid of him as 
part of a plan to retain control of the panama canal 
according to a 1977 treaty the united states is to turn the 
waterway over to local control in the year 2000 and remove its 
12000 military personnel from panama 
among the observers expected sunday are former presidents jimmy 
carter who signed the treaty and gerald ford they are part of an 
unofficial us delegation invited by the panamanian government 
the government has rejected any official us delegation

the bush administration says it might prohibit 
airline passengers from taking aboard portable computers tape 
players hair dryers and other electronic devices as a stopgap 
measure against terrorist bombings 
the ban covering items carried by hand or in luggage would 
prevent such items from being used to smuggle plastic explosives 
aboard planes until sophisticated bombdetection devices can be 
installed at high risk airports around the world 
both transportation secretary samuel skinner and his deputy 
secretary elaine chao raised the possibility of a total ban on 
electronic devices in forums this week ms chao said wednesday it 
could include everything from hair driers and electric shavers to 
laptop computers and portable tape players 
a total ban is an option that well have to consider she 
said adding that other alternatives also were being discussed both 
in the united states and abroad 
relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the dec 21 
bombing of pan am flight 103 asked that radiocassettes and similar 
devices be banned after officials concluded that plastic explosives 
concealed in such a unit blew up the plane over scotland 
current xray units used for handcarried items cannot detect 
plastic explosives and checkedin luggage usually is not scanned 
at all 
the transportation department has ordered airlines to buy and 
install devices that can detect plastic bombs such as thermal 
neutron analysis units which have been tested by the federal 
aviation administration on checkedin luggage skinner said the 
first unit will be installed at john f kennedy international 
airport in july and another one in great britain later in the year 
but officials acknowledge it could take two years or more to set 
up the 1 million units in all highrisk airports 
a bill passed by a congressional subcommittee on tuesday would 
have the government grant airlines and airports 270 million to pay 
for the units the administration insists the airlines should pay 
adding the cost to a security fee collected with airline tickets 
skinner said president bush who met with a group of the flight 
103 relatives last month has been pressing him on the issue of 
electronic devices the secretary said he also took it up with 
european transportation officials during his visits to five 
countries last week 
if were going to develop a program thats going to work on 
electronic devices its got to work with other nations skinner 
said in a national press club speech on tuesday 
all governments agreed to work to develop a standard 
program skinner said he noted that many journalists regularly 
travel with portable computers and other devices that might be 
affected if a ban were imposed 
we have to come up with a solution to make sure that if these 
devices go on airplanes they are safe and that a bomb is not 
inadvertently planted in one of these devices skinner said 
but he added we will not compromise safety for the sake of 
expediency 
both skinner and ms chao said that despite the need for 
additional security measures in the united states and abroad 
airplanes are among the safest ways to travel and us airlines are 
the safest in the world

late in the reagan administration a task force 
headed by vice president george bush branded 52 groups around the 
world as practitioners of terrorism among them the african 
national congress in whiteruled south africa 
now the veteran foreign service officer nominated by president 
bush to be assistant secretary of state for african affairs says 
that was a mistake 
at his confirmation hearing wednesday before the senate foreign 
relations committee the nominee herman j cohen testified that 
the blacknationalist organization is too important to be ignored 
as the united states seeks a peaceful negotiated end to south 
africas system of racial apartheid 
cohen was asked by sen jesse helms rnc about the listing 
of the anc as a terrorist organization and about testimony from 
secretary of state james a baker iii that it would be 
reasonable for the united states to shun such a group unless it 
renounced terrorist tactics 
cohen took the opposite view 
sir i think the designation of the anc as a terrorist 
organization was not correct cohen said 
wow helms exclaimed 
cohen said the anc is a large and active organization and 
conceded that the groups military wing has engaged in terrorist 
acts 
but i dont think we can designate the entire organization as 
a terrorist organization because of one activity by one of their 
wings he said 
in our discussions with them we have said we denounce such 
violence and that our relations with them have to be very minimal 
because of that 
but since they are such an important organization and have 
such a great influence in what goes on in south africa i dont 
think it would be in our interest not to deal with them not to 
talk to them cohen said 
responding to further questions from helms cohen said he 
believes the military wing of the anc has abandoned the practice of 
necklacing in which tires were placed around the necks of 
opponents filled with gasoline and set afire 
he added that he would recommend that baker meet with oliver 
tambo the ancs president if he visits washington he said a 
meeting between tambo and president bush would depend on the 
outcome of tambos discussions with baker 
overall cohen said he sees a new realism emerging in south 
africa on both sides of the apartheid battle with the government 
recognizing that it cannot impose changes on the black majority 
without their consent and the majority recognizing it cannot cause 
the collapse of the white power structure by direct frontal 
assaults 
it is increasingly clear to the black leadership in my view 
that constitutional change will have to come through a process of 
negotiation in which there will be no losers the nominee said 
cohen 57 a career foreign service officer since 1953 has 
served as us ambassador to the republics of senegal and gambia 
for the last two years he was the national security councils 
senior director for africa

mayor marion barrys political problems are 
mounting with the indictment of one of his former closest advisers 
who is charged with steering contracts to friends and routing money 
from the deals to barrys reelection campaign 
a federal grand jury on wednesday indicted two men including 
former barry adviser david e rivers on charges they conspired to 
award 3 million in city health services contracts to friends 
rivers and prominent city contractor john b clyburn were 
indicted after they allegedly worked to secure several city 
contracts for a company headed by undercover fbi agents gave other 
contracts to friends and assigned still others to a company clyburn 
owned 
rivers also faces two counts of agreeing to accept a bribe 
while clyburn has been charged with helping to bribe him 
barry already under federal investigation for his ties to a 
drug suspect said in a prepared statement my focus continues to 
be on managing the district of columbia government 
compounding barrys difficulties are a growing drugrelated 
crime wave and the possibility that jesse jackson barrys longtime 
civil rights ally might move to the nations capital and run for 
mayor in 1990 
prosecutors provided no details on how money from the alleged 
contract steering ended up in barrys 1986 reelection campaign 
fund but a source familiar with barrys 1986 campaign told the 
associated press that rivers and clyburn organized at least one 
fundraiser for barrys 1986 campaign 
the indictments come after a 21month grand jury probe that 
followed a 17month undercover fbi investigation into the citys 
contracting procedures 
if convicted of all charges rivers and clyburn could each face 
maximum prison terms of 50 years 
this indictment alleged a seamy web of corruption of 
concealment of manipulation and of selfdealing by one of the most 
senior officials in the district of columbia government said 
us attorney jay b stephens 
stephens alleged that both clyburn and rivers took about 10 
percent off the top in kickbacks for the 20 contracts and 
contract extensions mentioned in the indictment 
rivers was out of town wednesday said his attorney john mercer 
the 49page indictment charges that the alleged contracting 
scheme took place from 1983 through may 1987 
rivers took a leave of absence from his city job in august 1987 
after he became a target of the investigation

japan will develop an advanced jet fighter 
regardless of whether the united states participates defense 
secretary dick cheney told congressional critics of the fsx jet 
fighter 
disapproval of the fsx by the congress would most likely 
result in japan modifying an existing aircraft to meet the 
immediate military need and then attempting to develop 
indigenously a followon aircraft possibly with european 
assistance cheney told the house foreign affairs committee 
cheney was one of three top administration officials who went 
wednesday to capitol hill in an effort to put on a unified show of 
administration support of the fsx deal 
also appearing were commerce secretary robert a mosbacher and 
deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger 
i am confident that this agreement will not harm the economic 
security interests of the united states mosbacher told the 
panel mosbacher previously had voiced concern within the 
administration over economic implications of the 7 billion deal 
under the agreement st louisbased general dynamics and 
japans mitsubishi heavy industries would join forces to codevelop 
and coproduce the fsx an advanced version of the us f16 for 
deployment by japan in the late 1990s 
but rep mel levine dcalif declared at the hearing that i 
remain convinced that codevelopment of the fsx is not in americas 
national interest 
levine has been joined by 36 house cosponsors in introducing a 
draft resolution of disapproval aimed at halting the deal a 
companion resolution has been introduced in the senate 
critics of the deal have called it a giveaway of valuable 
advanced technology that japan may use to propel its own aircraft 
industry into headtohead competition with the united states in 
the world market 
they have argued that japan instead should buy off the shelf 
americanmade f16s to bolster its military capability more 
quickly at lower cost per plane and help reduce the 55 billion 
us trade deficit with japan 
even if the house and senate were to pass the resolutions 
however it would require a twothirds vote of both house to 
override a likely bush veto 
mosbacher told the committee he was satisfied with 
clarifications reached with the japanese providing for a us 
share of about 40 percent in both development and production of the 
plane as well as tight controls on transfer of sensitive 
technology to japan 
cheney and mosbacher reiterated the contention by supporters 
that the fsx agreement would bring advanced technology from japan 
to the united states 
however levine cited a report by the general accounting office 
an investigative arm of congress which found that key technologies 
to be received from japan involving composite wing construction 
and phasedarray radar are already well known to the us 
aircraft industry and in some cases are 10 years old 
cheney responded that the japanese have made significant 
advancements in industrial application of these technologies 
while some or even most of the technologies that the 
defense department is interested in exist in some form in this 
country us industry has not successfully developed them into 
usable technologies on the scale involved with the fsx he said 
eagleburger sought to rebut another argument raised by fsx 
critics about reports that mitsubishi heavy industries had been 
involved in building a bomb fabrication facility adjacent to a 
suspected chemical weapons production plant in libya 
the no 2 state department official said there was no evidence 
that the japanese company was in fact involved with constructing 
any portion of the libyan complex eagleburger called such reports 
misinformation

sharing friendship and a fatal disease the 
mayors of pittsburgh and erie turned to faith healers in a hotel 
room 17 months ago and joined hands to pray for a cure to save 
their lives 
christ has cured a lot of people and i said what do we have 
to lose eries louis j tullio said wednesday were people 
too and he can touch anyone 
lou is still alive and i think this has something to do with 
it said jeanne caliguiri widow of pittsburgh mayor richard s 
caliguiri 
caliguiri died at age 56 on may 6 five months after he and 
tullio prayed with faith healers charles and frances hunter 
the mayors were diagnosed in 1987 with amyloidosis which 
infiltrates and destroys vital organs through excess protein 
we were talking about the things of god mrs hunter said in 
a telephone interview wednesday from kingwood texas when we 
thought it was the right time we just laid hands on them you 
never know when the healing is going to connect 
jack grazier a reporter for the erie daily times said he 
introduced the mayors to the hunters on dec 12 1987 grazier and 
his wife debbie also joined the prayer session grazier said he 
knew the hunters from 1985 when the couple prayed for graziers 
wife to become pregnant 
the session was not publicized at the time grazier describes 
the meeting in detail in his book the power beyond to be 
published in june 
here were these guys wielding so much power in pennsylvanias 
second and thirdlargest cities going to a hotel room to meet with 
elderly faith healers in hopes of being cured of a fatal illness 
grazier said in a telephone interview wednesday 
to see them humbled like that was sort of a surreal 
experience here they were praying for their very lives grazier 
said we were right up against it 
both mayors disclosed within weeks of each other that they 
suffered from amyloidosis a rare disease that usually strikes men 
of mediterranean descent 
caliguiri pittsburgh mayor for 11 years died of heart failure 
resulting from the disease the 72yearold tullio eries mayor 
for 23 years has battled fluid accumulations in his lungs for 
several months and was released from a hospital saturday 
tullio and grazier said caliguiri was hesitant at first to join 
the session because of his roman catholic faith 
i said prayers are prayers and we have to have the lord cure 
us where it comes from is immaterial i told him i thought it was 
a great idea said tullio who is also a roman catholic 
i know dick did it because of lou they were very close 
mrs caliguiri said i remember sitting around a table and 
holding hands with each other they were both very inspirational to 
both dick and i she said of the hunters 
according to grazier caliguiri described his illness in detail 
tullio added his own description of the disease but was impatient 
to pray as the group talked about faith healing positive thinking 
god and the devil 
soon they stood in prayer in a circle around the mayors 
touching the mayors arms shoulders and backs as the hunters 
prayed 
caliguiri said he was trying to get this out of me by just 
concentrating because ive read books on how people have gotten 
better through their own tenacity and positive thinking 
according to grazier 
tullio described the session as wonderful 
i have become more religious as a result of my sickness 
tullio said asking the lord to cure you and having everyone pray 
for you means a lot

the senate finance committee is arranging a 
hearing this month to examine the financial underpinning of the new 
catastrophic illness insurance program specifically whether the 
surtax imposed on betteroff medicare recipients is too high 
the hearing is a direct outgrowth of the outcry from elderly 
medicare beneficiaries who will be hit with an income tax surcharge 
that can range up to 800 this year for about 5 percent of them in 
upper income ranges 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the committee chairman and a major 
architect of the landmark legislation that took effect jan 1 
recently raised the prospect that the maximum surcharge could be 
reduced he said new revenue estimates show the tax surcharge will 
generate more money than originally contemplated 
ironically those revised estimates suggest elderly americans as 
a group are better off financially than calculated last summer when 
congress was deciding to finance a major part of the program with a 
progressive surtax or supplemental premium applied only to 
medicare enrollees 
president bush has taken the position that even though more 
money than anticipated is flowing into the medicare catastrophic 
illness coverage fund it still will not be enough to cover costs 
over the long term 
by publicly asking bush for his thoughts on reducing the surtax 
bentsen has cast the white house in the role of opposing a tax 
reduction for elderly americans 
however bentsen had predicted in january that much of the 
political support for reducing the tax surcharge would evaporate 
after it became clear from hearings that nearly twothirds of 
medicare beneficiaries or about 21 million people would pay 
only 48 a year in additional fees in 1989 the flat 4 a month 
increase imposed on everyone 
for the remaining 12 million beneficiaries those with enough 
taxable income to have to pay at least 150 a year in tax the 
surcharge is determined by adding 2250 per person to each 150 of 
income tax liability 
that means the surtax can be as little as 45 for a couple or 
as much as 1600 and will show up first on tax returns filed after 
jan 1 1990 covering the current year 
medicare beneficiaries in lower income ranges tend to have lower 
tax liabilities than wageearners with a comparable gross income 
because their social security benefits are not subject to taxes 
although individual circumstances vary widely congress joint 
committee on taxation estimates a typical couple on medicare would 
have to have an income of at least 20000 a year before having to 
pay a surcharge and that on average it would amount to about 50 
for a couple in the 2000025000 income range 
the committee estimates about 16 million of the 33 million 
people covered by medicare would be hit by the maximum surcharge 
this year and a comparable percentage in subsequent years as both 
benefits and costs increase 
both the basic monthly fee and the supplemental premium 
rise reaching 1020 a month and 42 per 150 tax liability in 
1993 when the expansion including a new prescription drug benefit 
is fully implemented 
that translates to a maximum 1993 surtax of 1050 per 
individual or 2100 for a couple 
using those actual 1993 fees and surcharges the joint taxation 
committee estimates 111 percent of the programs total cost will 
be born by those in the 75000 to 200000 income range that 
taxpayers in that category account for 129 percent of all reported 
income and that their average return will be 112538 in 1988 
dollars 
it does not break down its distribution estimates to the 
75000100000 range the lowest category where the maximum 
surtax would start taking effect but says the average return in 
that category will be 87371 for a couple again in 1988 dollars 
because the surtax is capped those with incomes above 200000 
will pay 32 percent of the program costs in 1993 they account for 
193 percent of income reported on tax returns 
by contrast the committee estimates 239 percent of 1993 
program costs will fall on those in the 20000 to 30000 income 
range again in 1988 dollars even though they account for 182 
percent of total income and that 251 percent of the costs will be 
borne by those in the 30000 to 50000 range who account for 
163 percent of all income 
it projects the 1993 tax surcharge for a middleclass retired 
couple with 20000 to 25000 income at about 90 rising to about 
240 for a couple with a 30000 to 35000 income 
for the current year the committee projects the supplemental 
premium for a 20000 to 25000 a year couple will average about 
50 rising to about 150 for a couple in the 3000035000 range 
the committee estimates the maximum 1989 surtax for a couple 
will kick in at the 75000 to 100000 level and that the average 
joint return in that category will be 85751 
it estimates the average return in the 100000200000 level 
will be 136304 
for joint returns above 200000 the average jumps to 677495 
per return

christine jorgensen who told the 
world in 1952 she was a woman trapped in a mans body and shocked 
it by becoming the first person to undergo a sex change is dead 
she was 62 
miss jorgensen died of cancer at san clemente hospital on 
wednesday two days after she was admitted said hospital 
spokeswoman jami piearson 
she fought a 2year battle with the cancer which began in her 
bladder and a few weeks ago doctors found a brain tumor according 
to chris costello a friend publicist and daughter of the late 
comedian lou costello 
she was a wonderful understanding woman who loved everyone 
said actress dorothy lamour who also was a friend of miss 
jorgensen she gave out so much love and was a godloving woman 
one of the finest women i have ever met miss lamour said in a 
statement read by ms costello 
miss jorgensen a heavy smoker said in an interview last year 
that when she learned she had cancer she told herself 
this is cancer i wanted to be upfront and not try to deny 
it its like anything else i still joke and carry on i see some 
of the patients who just shuffle in and out and you just know that 
they arent going to make it 
she voiced no regrets about the sex change and the ensuing 
international publicity 
i am very proud now looking back she said it was the 
sexual revolution that was going to start with or without me we 
may not have started it but we gave it a good swift kick in the 
pants 
her operation is much more commonplace today 
as of 1980 an estimates 3000 to 6000 adults in the united 
states had undergone hormonal and surgical sex changes according 
to harry benjamin of the international gender dysphoria association 
the association estimates that 30000 to 60000 people have 
considered themselves candidates for the surgery 
miss jorgensen said last year her operation wouldnt get on 
the 95th page of the newspaper if it happened today 
she cherished her privacy and spent her final years as a 
homebody who stayed as much as she could out of the limelight 
still the transsexual pioneer remained unafraid of publicity 
and sued a mission viejo hospital for treatment of a cracked 
shoulder bone and several vertebrae after she fell in september 
1987 
she had said the injury was partially responsible for her not 
taking the lead role in an anaheim production of the musical 
mame 
miss jorgensen was born george jorgensen jr on may 30 1926 in 
new york city to parents of danish descent 
at age 26 the handsome former soldier shocked the world when

the willowy blonde who left the operating room in copenhagen 
denmark found that her new life made her an instant celebrity her 
notoriety sent her on the talk show lecture and nightclub 
circuits she met royalty and celebrities and ended up with enough 
money jewels and furs to live a comfortable life 
she never married and had lived the last few years in san 
clemente a seaside community about 50 miles south of downtown los 
angeles she had lived in california the last 20 years ms 
costello said 
miss jorgensen had been planning a sequel to her 1967 book 
christine jorgensen a personal biography ms costello said 
she also was working on finding a us distributor for a 
documentary produced in denmark on transsexuals lesbians and 
female impersonators 
christine was the type of person who always had an iron in the 
fire even in the very end ms costello said 
miss jorgensen is survived by a sister and two nieces a private

today is tax freedom day the day the 
average american taxpayer finishes paying off taxes 
the tax foundation calculates the average american will have to 
work 124 days this year the same as in 1987 and 1988 just to 
pay federal state and local taxes today is the 124th day of the 
year 
tax freedom day has never fallen later in the year this years 
date is also the same as in 1981 before president reagan and 
congress agreed on a 23percent acrosstheboard cut in individual 
income tax rates 
economists for the foundation a nonpartisan washington research 
group say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a 
dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and 
local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs

the local economy is holding together 
more than a year after the united states imposed sanctions on the 
government but increasingly it is a handtomouth daytoday 
existence 
the sanctions of march and april 1988 were intended to force the 
departure of gen manuel antonio noriega the panamanian strongman 
who has been indicted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges 
noriega chief of the defense forces is a central issue in 
sundays presidential election 
washington and the domestic political opposition accuse the 
government of planning to cheat to ensure noriegas handpicked 
candidate victory 
the sanctions froze about 56 million in panamanian government 
deposits in us banks and banned payments of taxes and some fees 
to panamanian government entities 
the united states also is holding about 140 million in panama 
canal payments in the name of eric delvalle deposed by noriega in 
march 1988 and still recognized by the united states as panamas 
president 
bank deposits are down sharply huge sums have left the country 
savings accounts remain frozen and cash is short loan availability 
is down sharply as is new construction in what used to be a booming 
panama city 
ironically the survival of the economy is due mostly to what 
the united states and us businesses spend here about 500 
million a year not counting the payrolls for 10000 troops and 
several large american companies 
the businesses include a texaco refinery the transpanama oil 
pipeline and the cherokee land co which grows bananas but because 
of the sanctions does not pay government export taxes of about 1 
million a month 
the 500 million is about 12 percent of panamas gross domestic 
product 
the government blames nearly all its problems on the sanctions 
although the economic decline actually started in mid1987 when 
panamanians worried about political instability started sending 
money out of the country 
the government says the gross domestic product dropped 171 
percent last year from 5 billion to 41 billion american 
economists contend only about a fourth of the drop is due to the 
sanctions 
panama which uses the american dollar has no central bank and 
cannot print more money unless it establishes its own currency 
which then would be subject to inflationary pressures 
in a statement wednesday the governments national banking 
commission said the situation had hit bottom and was starting to 
improve slightly 
but the commission said the banking system has a long way to go 
before returning to where it was before the crisis 
it still is necessary to increase the availability of loan 
funds in banks and this can be achieved if we panamanians keep our 
funds in banks in panama it said 
normally in latin america repatriation of capital flight 
follows a period of political stability something panama may not 
see for a time 
a panamanian government assessment of damages from the 
sanctions published in february said its income was down 44 
percent the study said the number of panamanians below the poverty 
line has risen from 33 percent to 40 percent

a 78yearold man who police say 
spent the last decade sweettalking women across the country then 
taking their valuables and disappearing has pleaded guilty to 
stealing from a widow 
arthur frankford also faces charges in polk and pinellas 
counties and the fbi is looking into the possibility he was 
involved in bank robberies said fbi agent bob neuman 
frankford whom police nicknamed the silver fox may have 
cheated scores of lonely women from iowa to florida authorities 
said 
his undoing came when a former sisterinlaw saw his case on 
nbctvs unsolved mysteries and called the programs hot line 
from the small coal mining town of stearns ky to say he was 
living nearby 
the case responsible for putting him on national television came 
from palm beach county the program depicted him as a man who met 
the widow at a church singles dance wined and dined her and moved 
in with her for a month when he disappeared he took her jewelry 
and a gun that belonged to her late husband 
this guy is slick palm beach county sheriffs detective 
dave hoyt said he could charm the socks off a dead guy 
a kentucky state trooper watching the show also recognized 
frankford as the man he had arrested on a drunkendriving charge 
the previous weekend 
officers who went to frankfords house to arrest him found he 
was masquerading as 56yearold james ferguson and that he was 
married to a 37yearold woman 
frankford was escorted tuesday into a palm beach county 
courtroom in handcuffs pleaded guilty to grand theft and agreed to 
pay 500 to the 62yearold lake park widow who allowed him into 
her home her heart and her safe in august 
when frankford was arrested he gave back most of the 4000 
worth of jewelry he had taken but the victim may never get the 
money she is owed court records show the man a former condominium 
maintenance worker who has a criminal record dating from 1945 
cannot afford to pay his court costs 
frankford who has spent the past three months in the county 
jail was sentenced to time served he will be transferred to the 
polk county jail where he awaits trial on 12 charges of forgery and 
grand theft said assistant state attorney catherine hall 
authorities trying to sort out frankfords past found a february 
1979 warrant based on a complaint from a sarasota socialite who 
told police that frankford then known as ferguson met her at a 
church function moved in and then stole her mercedesbenz 
a man matching fergusons description later moved to lakeland 
married a prominent woman and took nearly everything she had 
authorities said 
he was unbelievably smooth one victim who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said after frankford disappeared it was 
wining dining dancing and trips he mixed with the family and he 
was a very giving guy who always paid for things you would never 
have known

a homosexual allowed by a federal appeals 
court to reenlist in the army says the constitutionality of 
military bans on homosexuals will not be settled until more gay 
soldiers come out of the closet 
its an issue thats probably going to take a class 
actiontype suit before a court makes that broad a ruling 10 or 12 
people in the military who are willing to stand up and say theyre 
gay perry watkins said after wednesdays ruling 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals decision that the army 
erred when it denied him reenlistment was a wonderful ruling 
said the 14year veteran who is now working as a us forest 
service clerk in seattle 
civil rights lawyers who supported his case said the ruling was 
important despite its limited scope 
it is not a sweeping constitutional decision but it is a 
first step that recognizes the value of the services of openly gay 
soldiers said nan hunter of the american civil liberties unions 
lesbian and gay rights project which helped watkins 
lt col greg rixon an army spokesman declined to comment on 
the ruling but said there had been several other cases that have 
supported the ban against homosexuals from military service he 
said any decision concerning an appeal would be made by the 
solicitor general the justice departments top litigator who has 
not reviewed the ruling 
if the army doesnt appeal wednesdays ruling watkins said he 
would like to reenlist 
the court ruled in watkins favor on narrow grounds saying he 
was entitled to reinstatement because the army was aware of his 
homosexuality when he had previously reenlisted 
watkins of tacoma has greatly benefited the army and 
therefore the country by his military service said judge harry 
pregerson in the majority opinion 
but judge cynthia holcomb hall said the army never promised 
watkins an indefinite exemption from its ban she also said a court 
ruling prohibiting a service branch from applying one of its 
regulations would have a disruptive effect on military 
discipline 
seven of the 11 judges voted in watkins favor but only two 
addressed the constitutional issue that a smaller panel of the 
court had cited in a nowwithdrawn february 1988 decision 
that ruling was the first by any federal appeals court to 
declare that homosexuals because of longstanding persecution and 
political powerlessness were entitled to be protected against 
discrimination to the same degree as racial minorities by 
sidestepping that issue wednesday the court left it unresolved 
in wednesdays decision the court said it would be unjust to 
allow the army to enforce its antihomosexual policy against 
watkins because he said he was a homosexual when he was drafted in 
1967 and had been drafted and allowed to reenlist three times 
while the policy was in effect after two tours of duty in korea 
he became supervisor of the fort lewis wash personnel 
administration center 
defense department regulations prohibited the enlistment or 
reenlistment of homosexuals throughout that period new 
regulations were added in 1981 to require the discharge of soldiers 
whose homosexual conduct was discovered while they were in the 
military 
after a federal judge stopped the army from discharging watkins 
he was denied reenlistment in 1982 
us district judge barbara rothstein ordered watkins 
reinstated on grounds identical to wednesdays ruling but was 
reversed in 1983 by the appeals court leading to watkins 
discharge the following year

pamela small says she avoids business visits 
to the capitol because she could encounter the man who savagely 
attacked her with a knife and hammer 16 years ago and now is a top 
aide to house speaker jim wright 
but anger more than fear is what deters small an executive with 
the washington office of a major corporation anger that john paul 
mack 35 is one of the most powerful staff members on capitol 
hill earning about 89500 a year as wrights closest aide 
mack wouldnt have the job if he hadnt tried to kill me 
small told the washington post in an interview published today she 
described the unprovoked attack that required her to have seven 
hours of emergency surgery and more than a year of plastic surgery 
and hair transplants 
obviously i would rather he still be in prison she said 
if hes not im not sure what i would want him doing but 
playing a major part in running the government and making a lot of 
money off my taxes isnt it 
this guy has gotten special treatment from the beginning all 
the victim ever gets is a ride to the hospital 
mack whose brother was married to wrights daughter at the 
time served just 27 months of a 15year prison sentence for 
malicious wounding before making parole according to the post a 
job offer from wright helped make macks release possible the 
story said 
the post also reported that mack served his sentence in the 
fairfax county va jail rather than the state penitentiary 
the attack happened in a discount store in the washington suburb 
of annandale va in 1973 small was a 20yearold college student 
living with her parents but getting ready to move into her first 
apartment 
mack was a clerk at the store where small went to buy blinds 
unsuspectingly small followed mack into a storeroom when the only 
blinds on display turned out to be flawed the attack began when 
she refused to lie down as he had ordered 
he pounded her once in the head with a hammer knocking her 
unconscious immediately and then struck her four more times 
exposing her skull in five places according to the post 
he just reached out with his arm and the next thing i knew 
was the sound of the blow she said it was like when you dive 
into water that sound the sound and pain together were unreal 
like my brain was being squeezed into a tiny black dot 
he then stabbed her five times and slashed at her throat with a 
steak knife 
when she awoke some eight hours later she was in her compact 
car that mack had driven to an alley despite her wounds she drove 
one mile to a service station for help 
although she knew as far back as 1977 that mack was working on 
the hill she learned through an acquaintance who was dating him 
she didnt realize how prestigious a job he held 
as executive director of the congressional democratic steering 
and policy committee mack decides which legislation to put on the 
agenda and which to keep off 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif called mack one of the 
top five staffers on the hill in terms of competence 
this society believes in forgiveness coelho said 
mack when contacted by the post said when i was 19 i made 
a terrible tragic mistake i regret it every day i accepted the 
judgment of society then and i accept it now i have to put that 
behind me 
all i ask is that i be judged by what ive done since in terms 
of trustworthiness loyalty to my country my family and those who 
depend on me

mcdonalds intends to lift its golden arches and 
introduce the standard of a quick meal in clean surroundings when 
it opens its largest restaurant in the world in moscow 
mcdonalds announced its plans on wednesday by posting a sign 
outside a gutted cafe in a prime location on pushkin square at 
gorky street moscows major downtown shopping area 
to meet a demand described as infinite the first 
mcdonalds to open by years end will have 860 seats indoors and 
out and more than 400 soviet employees said george a cohon 
president of mcdonalds of canada ltd a subsidiary of mcdonalds 
corp of oak brook ill 
it should be capable of serving 12000 to 15000 people a day 
he said 
we opened in budapest a year ago and to this day people are 
lined down the street cohon said his firm is a 49 percent 
partner with the soviet government in the joint venture 
even the communist party newspaper pravda gushed in march that 
when mcdonalds finally opens people will be able to give an 
order and within moments walk away from the counter with appetizing 
food 
mcdonalds first announced its plans more than a year ago but 
has had to overcome a shortage of quality food in the soviet union 
to sell big macs for 150 to 250 rubles about 240 to 390 
mcdonalds is going local for its supplies said vladimir 
malyshkov director of the moscow food service administration his 
agency better known for offering greasy fare in dingy cafeterias 
is the soviet partner in the venture 
were doing our best to make everything soviet malyshkov 
said 
but to do that mcdonalds is shipping its own burbank russet 
seed potatoes teaching the soviets how to raise the beef and 
building its own processing plant said spokeman paul chater 
otherwise it could suffer the same shortages and spoilage problems 
as the average soviet consumer 
the factory under construction by a finnish firm in suburban 
moscow will produce burgers buns french fries and milk for the 
20 restaurants planned for moscow cohon said lettuce will be 
grown in greenhouses 
forget mcdlts cohon gave up on finding a yearround soviet 
supply of tomatoes 
the second restaurant closer to red square will sell its 
hamburgers only for foreign currency 
getting profits out of the soviet union is the stumbling block 
for most business deals because rubles are worthless in the rest of 
the world and the soviet union has an extreme shortage of foreign 
currency 
but cohon said hes not concerned about getting his profits out 
of the country 
well use our rubles to expand he said were not worried 
about taking profits out now were concerned about the 10000 
people who are going to line up here every day

two chinese dissidents were stopped in tokyo from 
boarding a flight for beijing today because the chinese government 
told airlines not to accept them they said 
wang bingzhang and tang guangzhang leaders of the chinese 
alliance of democracy said they were not allowed to get on japan 
airlines flight 5 
the men said they wanted to come to beijing to investigate 
the student prodemocracy movement the biggest ever in communist 
chinas 40year history 
a spokesman at the ministry of foreign affairs declined to 
comment on the dissidents allegations because he said they did 
not constitute a question of foreign affairs he declined to say 
which ministry handled the affair 
wang a native of china who has become an american citizen said 
he had no visa to enter china he said he had planned to stay in 
china for several days on transit and then head to thailand 
tang a chinese citizen and chemistry student at utah state 
university said he did not understand why he had been denied the 
right to board a plane to his homeland 
he was thrown out of china on jan 9 after he was apprehended in 
shanghai with copies of china spring the magazine is published by 
the chinese alliance of democracy based in new york city wang set 
up the dissident group in 1983 to promote democracy in china 
chinese officials have declared the alliance and its magazine 
illegal and reactionary 
earlier this week the government implied the group had been 
supporting the student movement 
wang said that although his group agrees with the students 
demands for a more democratic country his organization had not 
contacted the movement 
but he said he was determined to enter china and do so 
we have made up our minds to use any possible methods to 
return including sneaking into the country wang said 
tang said he didnt think his activities would hurt the movement

state education officials said there was 
good news and bad news in a national report that ranked mississippi 
at or near the bottom in college entrance test scores and 
graduation rates 
the good news is we continue to make progress the bad news is 
that progress comes slowly and even though were beginning to pass 
states by we continue to rank down near the bottom said state 
superintendent of education richard boyd 
the us education departments state education performance 
chart released wednesday showed mississippi had made some gains 
but fared poorly compared to the rest of the nation 
mississippi ranked last among the 28 states where the american 
college testing program or act is the predominant college 
entrance examination 
but state department of education spokesman andy mullins said 
the average mississippi act score was up 07 point to 162 in 1988 
over 1987 the test is scored on a scale of 1 to 36 nationwide 
the average score was up 01 point to 188 and 11 states showed a 
decline in scores 
theres a good news scenario unfolding which shows that 
mississippi is one of five states showing the greatest movement in 
act scores over the period 1982 through 1988 said olon ray 
education assistant to gov ray mabus 
ray said it was interesting and also significant that the 
improvement in mississippi parallels the life of the education 
reform movement in the state 
the legislature in 1982 followed the urging of thengov william 
winter and apporved the education reform act which made sweeping 
changes in mississippis education system mabus has promised to 
propose an education reform ii package this year 
but state rep jim simpson chairman of the house education 
committee said the new report points up that education reform is 
not something you enact and look next year to see if the problem is 
gone 
we are not through with education said simpson im 
afraid people want an overnight cure 
mississippi ranked 43rd in the amount spent per student as a 
percentage of the states per capita income mississippi school 
districts spent an average 2350 per student in 1987 about 228 
percent of the states per capita income of 10292 
the report also ranked the state 44th in 1987 in the number of 
students who enter first grade and eventually receive high school 
diplomas the states graduation rate was 648 percent 
the state was in 41st place in 1988 in the teacherstudent 
ratio with 188 pupils for every teacher the national average was 
176 
were encouraged by the fact that were doing much better in 
some very important areas ray said we also understand that in 
order to be competitive were going to have to do much better

innovative programs school evaluations and 
committed teachers lawmakers and parents have helped minnesota 
lead the nation in the percentage of students graduating from high 
school state officials said 
were delighted that we continue to hold that ranking 
minnesota education commissioner ruth randall said wednesday 
noting the state has had the no 1 high school graduation rate 
since 1982 in the us education departments state education 
performance chart 
minnesota students also tied for third with montana for highest 
american college testing program act scores among the 28 states 
that rely upon that test as a benchmark for college preparedness 
with an average score of 199 out of 36 the national mean for 1988 
was 188 
randall said teachers students and lawmakers deserved credit 
for the states 906 percent graduation rate in particular she 
cited a program passed by state legislators in 1987 that kept 2500 
pregnant minors and mothers in high school by offering them 
transportation day care and counseling 
we do care about our schools in minnesota theres that 
climate here she said 
its minnesotas culture the neat part about minnesota is 
that theres always been a emphasis on learning exploring 
discovering senate education committee chairman james pehler 
said 
he attributed part of the success to annual performance 
evaluations of schools conducted with community participation and 
the creation of area learning centers or alternative high schools 
for students likely to drop out 
gov rudy perpich who likes to refer to himself as the 
education governor said he could not comment on the report 
until he reads it 
perpich has led the fight for two major education innovations 
that have attracted national attention 
a postsecondary enrollment options program allows minnesota 
high school juniors and seniors to take college courses and an 
open enrollment program allows students to attend the public school 
of their choice 
the open enrollment program has been widely hailed by president 
bush as a model for choice in education 
judy schaubach secretarytreasurer of the minnesota education 
association said the states teachers have played a major part in 
minnesotas high rankings 
it shows that the programs we do offer are quality programs 
she said the teachers arent just keeping the students in the 
classrooms theyre doing something constructive with them 
minnesota pays its teachers an average 29900 salary 11th 
highest in the nation according to the us education department 
that compares with a national average of 28000 
in 1987 the state ranked 17th with 4180 spent per student 
the national average was 3977 that year 
minnesota had 171 students for every teacher in 1988 giving it 
a 24th place ranking nationally the national average is 176 
students to each teacher

i think we have some pretty good news dr robert s kurtz 
assistant chief of surgery and director of surgical intensive care 
said at a news conference 
kurtz and dr kent duffy chief of neurosurgery said the woman 
had spoken in a hoarse whisper to relatives and staff members on 
tuesday raised two fingers when asked to do so and was able to 
read large flash cards printed with yes no and her name 
when hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded three 
or four people started clapping i was one of them kurtz said 
and when a nurse told the 28yearold patient that she would 
like to resume jogging the patient replied me too kurtz 
said 
the woman an investment banker and a native of a pittsburgh

said 
when told at a city hall news conference that the victim was 
recovering mayor edward i koch commented isnt that

two bridge collapses that killed nine 
people in two weeks have put a spotlight on highway inspections 
and a us senator says the entire country faces the mammoth 
task of repairing bridges 
a bridge collapse on april 1 dumped two lanes of us highway 51 
into the hatchie river about 45 miles north of memphis tenn 
killing eight people two weeks after that an east tennessee 
teenager died when a small wooden span collapsed in the state 
we need to understand that bridges do get old and wear out and 
there has to be enough money federal and state to rebuild them 
when rebuilding is needed said les lamm of the washington 
dcbased highway users federation 
sen jim sasser dtenn who toured the tennessee bridge site 
last month with us transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
some 240000 bridges across the country need repairs and fixing 
them could cost more than 50 billion 
but money is not the only problem sasser said 
our bridge inspection program is chaotic and our bridge repair 
program is haphazardly administered he said sometimes were 
repairing reasonably sound bridges and at the same time neglecting 
bridges that are a genuine hazard 
although the federal government pays most of the money for 
bridge repairs on major roadways states conduct the inspections 
as records of the tennessee transportation department show 
deficiencies pointed out by those inspections are often left 
unfixed 
inspections of the hatchie bridge found evidence of soil erosion 
around bridge supports in 1985 and 1987 but nothing was done the 
bridge was checked again in february because of heavy flooding but 
no underwater inspection was made 
authorities said the hatchie bridge apparently fell because of 
erosion or scouring around a bridge support the collapse dumped 
four cars and an tractortrailer into the river and everyone in 
those vehicles died 
since the collapse tennessee officials have stepped up 
inspections and have closed four bridges on statemaintained 
highways 
discussions on bridge safety following the hatchie collapse have 
centered on the lack of nationwide standards for inspection and 
repair and on the need for more money 
weve simply got to get the federal highway adminstration 
better organized to deal with the mammoth task of renovating this 
nations bridge system sasser said in remarks prepared for 
todays meeting of his government affairs subcommittee on general 
services 
a decrease in federal money for bridge repairs in recent years 
means states must get accustomed to carrying more of the load 
themselves said william allen a member of the american consulting 
engineers council 
were starting to realize the magnitude of the job in front of 
us and the states are all scrambling allen said 
state and local officials in some areas have even begun talking 
about turning over bridges and highways to private companies that 
would try to run them for profit he said 
lamm said state and local governments also must realize that 
putting off bridge repairs to save money for more politically 
urgent projects can be unwise 
its easy to defer maintenance on any kind of public works 
activity because you can let bridge repair or road repaving go for 
a couple of years and it doesnt show up right away he said 
the hatchie bridge was built in 1934 authorities say the large 
number of deficient bridges around the country is a symptom of the 
overall aging of the nations infrastructure the roads bridges 
utility systems airports and other parts of the physical framework 
of modern life 
sassers subcommittee hearing which was scheduled several 
months before the hatchie bridge collapse was called for a general 
discussion on the aging infrastructure but the collapse refocused 
the debate on bridges said larry stein an aide to the senator

edward ochab a prominent communist 
official over three decades who briefly served as party first 
secretary during the 1956 poststalinist thaw has died the 
government reported he was 82 
the official pap news agency said ochab had died monday 
ochab joined the prewar polish communist party in 1929 
he helped defend warsaw after the nazis attacked in 1939 and 
later escaped to the soviet union where he helped organize the 
union of polish patriots that was a precursor of the 
moscowinstalled postwar communist government 
after moscowsponsored communists won out in a postwar power 
struggle with communists who spent the war fighting inside poland 
ochab succeeded to a number of prominent party and government posts 
when party leader boleslaw bierut died during a visit to moscow 
in march 1956 ochab briefly served as party leader but labor 
turmoil in june of that year and popular resentment of soviet 
influences led him to relinquish leadership in october 1956 to 
wladyslaw gomulka 
gomulka represented the national communist wing of the party 
that had been suppressed by the moscow faction after the war 
ochab remained a party secretary and served as president of the 
council of state from 1964 until 1968 when he quit all his posts 
in a 1981 interview he said he had resigned to protest the 
antizionist party purge in 1968 directed against jews and 
intellectuals

the woman who preceded henry cisneros as 
mayor of the nations ninthlargest city is looking to replace him 
come saturday when voters in el paso and dallas also go to the 
polls to elect mayors 
former san antonio mayor lila cockrell is vying to succeed 
cisneros the popular 41yearold hispanic mayor who will enter an 
asset management partnership after 14 years of public service 
including eight as mayor 
dallas mayor annette strauss whose city has been rocked by 
police shootings has lost some minority endorsements she received 
in her initial race two years ago this time though the business 
community is supporting her reelection bid 
in el paso six candidates vying to replace mayor jonathan 
rogers who by law cannot seek a fifth twoyear term say they 
want to reduce crime and promote economic development in the border 
town 
but the sevencandidate san antonio mayors race seems to be 
drawing a great deal of attention around the state because of 
cisneros departure 
the 67yearold ms cockrell who was mayor from 1975 to 1981 
has said she laid some of the groundwork for cisneros and now wants 
to concentrate on his economic development efforts 
im not a spectacular mayor like henry is but i have 
confidence in myself that i will be a good mayor and that i will 
keep the city moving said ms cockrell who has spent about 
137000 in her campaign 
beset by a troubled marriage and his sons ill health cisneros 
decided last year against a fifth term 
he reconsidered his mayoral reelection decision in january 
after voters overwhelmingly approved a public transportation tax to 
pay for construction of a domed stadium that he supported but he 
decided against running after ms cockrells supporters said they 
would stay behind her 
the city charter gives the mayor and city council members equal 
stature but because of his personality and leadership skill 
cisneros turned it into a powerful position as he promoted the city 
and rose to national prominence 
san antonio unlike other major texas cities was the only 
metropolitan area that experienced job growth during the last five 
years although many of those jobs were lowpaying analysts said 
also running for mayor here is carl mauthe a 52yearold 
insurance executive who says he offers voters strong management 
experience and a choice to a recycled mayor 
i have no baggage i have no obligations to any group and im 
not going to bring stale ideas about city government with me and 
im not going to rubberstamp everything said mauthe who has 
raised less than 20000 
in dallas mrs strauss lost the support of some minority 
groups who have complained of strained relations with city 
government and now support one of her three opponents criminal 
defense attorney peter lesser 
mrs strauss 65 has raised 300000 compared with the 16000 
raised by lesser who discounts the clout of contributions 
money is not going to win this election a poor persons vote 
counts the same as a millionares vote said the 41yearold 
lesser 
but a poll taken last week by the dallas morning news found mrs 
strauss was favored by 53 percent of those surveyed in the nations 
eighthlargest city lesser was next with 6 percent thirtyseven 
percent were undecided 
two years ago mrs strauss said promoting economic development 
and expanding the police force were her priorities while the 
economy seemed to stabilize during her tenure the crime rate 
escalated policerelated shootings increased and police morale 
plummeted 
dallas has been through some tough times mrs strauss said 
recently but weve stood tall and made progress we are 
recapturing the momentum of the 60s 70s and early 80s and i 
want to finish the job i started 
the dallas mayors post like the san antonio job is mostly 
ceremonial both pay 50 per weekly council meeting 
in el paso the mayor has more power because theres no city 
manager 
the race has attracted six candidates including city council 
members suzie azar and ed elsey and state rep paul moreno all 
democrats in the nonpartisan election 
observers believe moreno the only hispanic running in a city 
with a population thats 63 percent hispanic will make it to the 
may 27 runoff with either elsey or ms azar ms azar won 
endorsements from both daily newspapers 
el paso has to get away from the image of the sleepy mexican 
town with low wages said moreno who wants to attract state and 
federal grants to help small businesses we cant continue to 
draw business here by saying they can pay the minimum wage 
ms azar who favors tax abatements is optimistic the city can 
attract more hightech businesses 
elsey whose economic development plan is similar to ms azars 
points to two new plants as signs that the city is attracting new 
businesses

a deer hunter on trial for the third time 
in the shooting death of a wildlife officer during a struggle in 
the woods was convicted of a lesser charge of thirddegree murder 
steve strange 26 of mossy head had been charged with 
firstdegree murder which could have brought the death penalty or 
life behind bars 
but the jury deliberated six hours wednesday before returning 
the conviction on thirddegree murder which is a death that 
results from violently resisting arrest strange faces three to 30 
years in prison sentencing was scheduled for today 
our judicial system stinks said ray barnes father of the 
victim florida game and fresh water fish commission officer ray 
lynn barnes strange shot barnes with officers own revolver during 
a nighttime struggle nov 21 1987 
the first jurys guilty verdict in walton county where the 
shooting took place was thrown out last september because a judge 
allowed the panel to use a dictionary while deliberating 
the case was moved here because of extensive publicity but a 
mistrial was declared in february after a second jury deadlocked 
strange did not react when the jurys verdict was read 
the jury also found strange guilty of grand theft in taking the 
officers service revolver possession of firearm during commission 
of a felony and hunting without a license 
in his closing argument assistant state attorney drew pinkerton 
quoted testimony by stranges companion kenneth collars who said 
he was hunting near the spot where the defendant struggled with the 
state game and fresh water fish commission officer but didnt see 
it 
collars testified tuesday that strange told him he had 
murdered a man 
he confessed at that time to one of the highest courts in the 
world his own conscience pinkerton told the jury 
the defense contended strange was only trying to defend himself 
after the officer grabbed his shotgun to take it away 
the prosecution said barnes was trying to arrest strange for 
hunting without a license the officer initially suffered a 
nonfatal leg wound when stranges shotgun barrel exploded the 
muzzle blocked by dirt he subsequently was shot in the chest and 
head with his service revolver 
loveless contended strange didnt realize barnes was a wildlife 
officer because he was wearing a camouflage jacket that hid his 
uniform shirt 
unlike the first two trials strange did not testify a tape 
recording of his police interrogation was played for the jury 
he contended barnes gun went off as they struggled strange 
also left the impression that he realized barnes was an officer 
because of the broad stripes on his trousers

for the second time in a week abc has 
canceled the scheduled broadcast of a realitybased television 
show pulling scandals ii from its primetime lineup 
the onehour sampler of famous scandals was to have been 
broadcast saturday night the network said wednesday 
the scandals ii announcement came one day after abc said it 
had removed its crimes of passion ii from its schedule last 
saturday after the crime reenactment program failed to generate 
any paid advertising 
in a statement on the scandals ii move abc entertainment 
president robert iger said the network was not bowing to outside 
pressure groups lack of advertiser support or complaints by the 
persons featured in the program 
rather iger said we are currently considering the 
appropriate role for realitybased programming on our schedule in 
the interim we will consider each program on a casebycase basis 
the program replacing scandals ii probably will be a 
onehour drama said abc spokesman jim brochu 
the first scandals program was one of several factbased 
shows created in the wake of last years crippling scriptwriters 
strike while some of the shows produced healthy ratings many were 
attacked for lurid content 
the original scandals broadcast oct 29 produced an 
unspectacular rating of 80 which means that 8 percent of the 
nations homes with television watched the show but the rating was 
good enough to prompt a sequel 
when it was unable to sell any advertising for crimes of 
passion ii abc was forced to fill the time period with the 
lackluster comedy pilots livin large and heart and soul a 
show that runs without paid advertising would be rated by the ac 
nielsen company as zero a zero would hurt the networks overall 
rating during the crucial may sweeps one of four periods when 
ratings are used to determine a local affiliates advertising rates 
the network attributed the lack of advertiser interest in 
crimes of passion ii to increased sensitivity about the 
depiction of graphic violence and sex on television 
in recent weeks advertisers have pulled their commercials from 
nbcs saturday night live and nightingales and the fox 
broadcasting corps married with children all three shows 
have been criticized by viewers and advocacy groups for their frank 
language and sexual situations

for the first time in more than 40 years 
poles are going to be able to pick up a daily newspaper not 
controlled by the government and the editors promise to separate 
fact from opinion 
there even will be sports in the gazeta wyborcza tabloid to be 
published by the countrys solidarityled opposition 
the paper whose name means the election newspaper hopes to 
make its debut monday after a frantic search for offices and the 
quick assembly of a staff 
deputy editor ernest skalski describes it as the first 
independent daily between the elbe and the pacific 
although the paper will have a government censor in the office 
editors say theyll be able to maintain an independent voice 
compared to the gray propagandaladen dailies put out by the 
communist party the government and various official organizations 
gazeta wyborcza intends to be lively with short articles and more 
foreign news 
polish dailies are in my opinion very bad they make even 
good news look so boring said helena luczywo a deputy editor 
who for seven years put out the leading underground weekly 
tygodnik mazowsze even if there is something interesting they 
tend to put in all kinds of official visits statements and 
speeches and threequarters of the paper is this 
we really hope to put the interesting and hot news where it 
can be seen by everyone besides i think the selection of news is 
going to be totally different she said 
the eightpage newspaper will start out by reporting on the june 
parliamentary elections and continue as a daily with an opposition 
editorial viewpoint 
but it plans to make a clear distinction between straight 
information and editorializing ms luczywo said 
although poland has had a vibrant underground press for more 
than a decade editions were put out at best only weekly and with 
limited press runs of 20000 to 30000 copies 
under an agreement reached in april between the government and 
solidarity the opposition will be allowed to publish a 
500000circulation daily the newspaper will be printed on state 
presses and sold in stateowned kiosks 
access to the mass media was one of the oppositions conditions 
for joining in the agreement which calls for the opposition to 
participate in the parliament elections it also legalized 
solidarity the independent trade union movement after a 
sevenyear ban 
our paper is not the solidarity trade unions paper but it 
aspires to be the paper of the whole opposition said skalski 
skalski said the last time poland had a daily newspaper 
independent of communist party control was before the party 
consolidated power in 1947 
the editorinchief is to be adam michnik an essayist and 
historian who is one of the leading theoreticians of the 
opposition he was assigned the task by solidarity leader lech 
walesa 
the staff will number about 50 and include people from the now 
liquidated tygodnik mazowsze which means weekly of the mazowsze 
region that includes warsaw also on the staff are students and 
recent graduates of warsaw universitys journalism school 
many of the countrys bestknown independent journalists also 
will contribute articles from time to time said ms luczywo 
the newspaper is also to have a section that will contain news 
about a faction of the opposition that is against compromise with 
the authorities in other words the political rivals of walesa 
and the papers editors 
ms luczywo said the section most likely to be censored will 
contain foreign news which will concentrate on changes in the east 
bloc 
preparations for publishing began the day solidarity and the 
government signed their agreement 
after several false starts the paper finally received offices 
from authorities tuesday in a vacant childrens nursery in southern 
warsaw 
at midweek it was still waiting for phone and telex 
connections ms luczywo said 
technically the paper is the property of a company set up with 
three shareholders warsaw solidarity leader zbigniew bujak 
filmmaker andrzej wajda and aleksander paszysnski founder of the 
proprivate enterprise economic society initial financing is 
coming from a bank loan and the newspaper hopes later to accept 
advertising 
for ms luczywo leaving the underground press for gazeta 
wyborcza has meant the freedom to use the telephone instead of 
couriers 
but she is having trouble picturing a censor at her elbow while 
she edits 
ive never seen a censor in my life she said laughing at 
the thought ive been working for the uncensored press since 
1977 for 12 years so now im kind of losing my virginity

a 42yearold baby sitter was trying to 
impress her employers with her vigilance when she put straight pins 
in a 6monthold childs baby food and reported it as food 
tampering officials say 
barbara rexroad wanted to show the parents that she was taking 
care of the child and watching out for him said police chief 
mike walton 
mrs rexroad was charged wednesday with communication of false 
information of tainting of a consumer product a felony carrying a 
maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 250000 fine said 
us attorney j william roberts 
the woman was released on her own recognizance after a hearing 
before us magistrate charles evans a preliminary hearing was set 
for may 23 
she declined to comment when she left the federal courthouse 
but her attorney michael metnick told the magistratethere was 
never any intent that these pins would be fed or further 
transmitted in interstate commerce 
roberts said the woman admitted monday under questioning by 
police and fbi agents that she planted the pins in the two jars of 
heinz baby food and made up the story she surrendered wednesday 
afternoon after a criminal complaint was filed he said 
heinz baby food was pulled from store shelves in springfield 
after the false report friday night but was placed back on sale 
this week after local officials consulted with the us food and 
drug administration 
a second report of tampering involving heinz baby food surfaced 
monday in jacksonville less than 30 miles west of springfield but 
a heinz official called it a copycat event and said the company 
would push for vigorous prosecution 
this type of event undermines the integrity of the products we 
produce and thats not something we plan to stand by and watch 
said david w lance security manager for pittsburghbased heinz 
usa

howitzer shells and rockets fired from 
syrianpoliced west beirut crashed along the coast of a christian 
area north of the city today despite a ceasefire brokered by the 
arab league 
a police spokesman said the artillery fire hit the beach of the 
310squaremile christian enclave at the rate of four per hour no 
casualties were reported 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing rules 
said the barrage was obviously an attempt to maintain the 
blockade of christian ports 
gunners of gen michel aouns 20000strong christian army units 
did not return fire the spokesman said 
aoun also head of the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government on wednesday accepted a truce that involves lifting the 
blockades he imposed on illegal ports run by moslem militias said 
arab league envoys lakhdar ibrahimi of algeria and abdelaziz 
aljassem of syria 
they said aouns sunni moslem rival and cabinet leader salim 
hoss also agreed to the ceasefire 
the christianrun voice of lebanon radio station quoted jassem 
as saying today the agreement was not a magic stick that can 
block the barrel of each cannon to silence it 
we will ask leaders in west beirut why the ceasefire is not 
being honored jassem was quoted as saying 
the arab envoys spent the night at a hotel in the christian 
mountain resort of brummana northeast of beirut they crossed 
beiruts dividing green line this morning for meetings with moslem 
leaders in the citys western sector 
on wednesday the ferry service between the christian enclave 
and cyprus resumed with the baroness m taking on about 400 
passengers the service had been suspended while the port of 
jounieh north of beirut was shelled 
the captain of the cypriotflagged ferry remained 15 miles 
offshore because he was skeptical about guarantees the vessel would 
not be shelled and small boats shuttled passengers to the ferry 
druse warlord walid jumblatt syrias main ally in the 
confrontation with aoun on wednesday demanded measures to block 
alleged weapon supplies from iraq to aoun through the christian 
ports 
there is no justification for any shot to be fired in lebanon 
as of now ibrahimi said wednesday after meeting separately with 
aoun and hoss 
i can say the ceasefire has taken effect today after the 
settlement of ports dispute the observer force will begin arriving 
soon he said without elaborating 
the truce announced friday after an emergency meeting of arab 
foreign ministers in tunisia calls for a group of military 
observers from arab nations to monitor implementation of the 
ceasefire 
aoun had welcomed the decision saying the observers would 
watch the syrians here 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops 
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in west and south 
beirut under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
the current round of violence broke out on march 8 two days 
after aoun ordered a blockade of the ports run by syrias two main 
allies jumblatts militia and amal led by shiite moslem leader 
nabih berri 
aouns army blockaded two of jumblatts ports and druse and 
syrian gunners who outnumber christian forces by 31 retaliated

a 19yearold woman whose sentence on child abuse 
charges had included an order for lifetime birth control recently 
gave birth to her fourth child officials said 
debra ann forster had pleaded guilty april 4 1988 to two 
counts of attempted child abuse for leaving her two sons then 7 
months and 18 months old in her sweltering suburban mesa apartment 
unattended for three days in may 1987 when her estranged husband 
and father of the children found them they were severely 
dehydrated and one was near death according to court testimony 
the boys recovered 
the judge who sentenced ms forster in may 1988 lifted the birth 
control condition of the probation sentence in august as 
unenforceable when she learned ms forster was pregnant 
the probation term ordered by judge lindsay ellis of maricopa 
county superior court also barred ms forster from caring for any 
child 
ms forsters probation officer lori scott confirmed wednesday 
that ms forster gave birth last week but she would not disclose 
the date or location 
its a very delicate situation the probation officer said 
adding that the judge ordered her not to release any details on the 
case 
a daughter born in march 1988 while ms forster was in jail 
awaiting resolution of her case was put up for adoption the two 
boys were put in the states custody 
ms ellis said wednesday that the infants fate is likely to be 
decided largely by child protective services and perhaps 
ultimately by juvenile court 
the judge would not say who is caring for the infant but said 
she has been assured it is not ms forster 
she declined to discuss the case further 
ms forsters stepfather joseph lantier of patterson la said 
wednesday he spoke with his stepdaughter on tuesday and that she 
gave birth to a healthy girl he would not say what her intentions 
were regarding the baby 
its a controversial case and im not going to say anything 
to jeopardize her said lantier 
lantier cared for ms forster from age 10 to 15 in louisiana 
ms forster a seventhgrade dropout married at 15 and had her 
first child at that age 
in october ms ellis denied ms forster permission to travel to 
new york to appear on phil donahues television show the probation 
order prohibited ms forster from leaving arizona without court 
permission and the judge said in october that allowing ms forster 
to appear on the show would be like throwing her into the mouths 
of sharks 
ms forster has reconciled with her husband and is attempting to 
complete her high school education scott said

their independent unions spurned by communist 
leaders tens of thousands of students pushed through police lines 
today into central tiananmen square on the 70th anniversary of 
chinas first student movement 
thousands also demonstrated in shanghai and nanjing for 
democracy and press freedom while several hundred took to the 
streets in changsha three hundred journalists from the staterun 
press joined the march in beijing 
students plowed into tiananmen chinas symbolic seat of power 
throughout the day 
by midafternoon more than 70000 people about half of them 
students packed the 100acre expanse in a collage of chanting 
flagwaving and singing 
red and white banners calling for freedoms unheard of in china 
since the communists came to power 40 years ago flapped in the wind 
bystanders lining the streets by the thousands had applauded 
and cheered the demonstrators as they marched along the 10mile 
route to the square 
it was the sixth time in three weeks that students have made the 
pilgrimage to demand fundamental reforms of chinas autocratic 
political system 
if this continues china has hope said one onlooker 
thousands of workers ignored government warnings that they would 
be fired if they attended the march said one government employee 
this is the first time in 40 years such a big movement for 
democracy has occurred ill just show up at work tomorrow and see 
what happens he said 
about an hour before the protest ended and students left the 
square their leaders announced that students twoweek old class 
boycott would end friday 
at least 55 schools participated in todays march including 
small delegations from more than 10 schools outside beijing 
including hong kongs chinese university 
in a statement read at the square student leaders reiterated 
their demands for a dialogue with the government they had called 
todays march after authorities on wednesday refused to recognize 
their newly formed union and open up a dialogue with democratically 
elected student representatives 
the government has called the student demands naive and 
impulsive and called the students united association of beijing 
universities illegal 
police today put up far less resistance than during last 
thursdays protest when 150000 students and supporters marched to 
the square in communist chinas biggest demonstration ever 
but outside beijing normal university thousands of students 
came up against a wall of several hundred police and there was much 
pushing and shoving during which police grabbed protesters hair 
before the students broke through 
students and 1000 police collided again in front of the beijing 
hotel when protesters from colleges in the eastern part of the city 
moved toward the square after several tries they too plowed 
through police lines 
students walked handinhand down beijings broad boulevards 
some wore red headbands reading mom im not wrong 
rise ye who refuse to be slaves a group of students 
bellowed singing the chinese national anthem as they passed the 
communist party headquarters at zhongnanhai 
down with bureaucracy others chanted 
the headquarters was the scene of a dramatic standoff between 
students and hundreds of police two weeks ago thursday only four 
guards stood at the gates 
by early afternoon police presence had all but vanished from 
tiananmen a banner reading the world is for all was hung 
over a huge portrait of sun yatsen who led chinas first 
revolution in 1911 the portrait was erected earlier this week in 
the square for annual may day celebrations 
every country demands democracy said a teacher from the 
central academy of industrial arts democracy is developing here 
too 
three hundred journalists from the state press held an 
unprecedented protest at the official xinhua news agency calling 
for a free press some said they had been locked inside their 
offices and had to sneak out to take part 
the group later joined the student march carrying banners 
supporting qin benli the editor of a liberal shanghai newspaper 
the world economic herald qin was sacked last week after his paper 
was critical of the government 
our mouths cannot say what we want them to said one banner 
as the protest ended student leader wuer kaixi urged students 
to continue their efforts to inform citizens about their movement 
students gathered contributions from the crowds and gave out 
pamphlets explaining their movement 
we need the support of the people yelled one young man as 
bystanders stuffed bills into his box without the people we can 
do nothing 
in shanghai about 7000 students gathered near communist party 
offices with banners calling for democracy witnesses said 
onlookers were kept from the protest in nanjing about 1000 
university students marched to the provincial government 
headquarters another witness said 
and in changsha capital of hunan province about 300 students 
marched in sympathy of the beijing rally an american teacher said 
in contrast to last weeks march when students were angered by 
the governments opposition to their demands for democracy and 
freedom todays march had an air of defiant celebration 
today is a holiday and we are here to remember may 4th 
said one student 
on may 4 1919 beijing university students launched a campaign 
for science and democracy showing intellectuals for the first time 
their power to lead the masses and affect policy

labor unions will gain the right to strike in new 
legislation designed to free them from decades of meek subservience 
to the communist party and government a leading soviet union 
official said 
unions must have the right to stop work at enterprises in 
organizations and institutions as a means of pressure on the 
administration for speeding up the resolution of labor disputes 
stepan a shalaev told the labor newspaper trud in an interview 
published wednesday 
but shalaev made clear that the central council of trade unions 
that he chairs does not expect strikes to become as common as they 
are elsewhere 
the decision to stop work at an enterprise this is an 
extreme measure to be taken only in extreme circumstances he 
said 
shalaev said the draft law published saturday would be 
discussed by unions for three months it must eventually be 
approved by the new supreme soviet parliament which is considered 
likely 
giving unions a limited right to strike appeared to be an effort 
to prevent labor unrest from taking on the dimension that led to 
the formation of the solidarity free trade union movement in poland 
solidarity was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown and not 
reinstated until last month 
under current soviet law unions are not permitted to strike 
instead they are quiet partners with management and the ruling 
communist party communist ideology considers strikes a western 
phenomenon stemming from worker exploitation 
soviet unions have assumed a variety of functions such as 
building and organizing housing for members or running vacation 
facilities for members they traditionally have done nothing to 
advance wage demands and work conditions 
shalaev said unions would be free of government interference 
under the draft law and workers protected from losing their jobs as 
a result of union activity the law also ensures that local union 
officials are independent of the administration of the factory or 
office where they work he said 
in an article monday the international may day holiday an 
economist wrote in the newspaper socialist industry that the 
countrys union system has done nothing to help workers 
alexander auzan wrote that unions are subservient to the 
government and are concerned not with defending the interests of 
the workers but only with maintaining peace and quiet and an 
imitation of mass support 
however that has not prevented labor unrest from spreading in 
certain industries as president mikhail s gorbachevs economic 
reforms take hold and greater openness encourages soviets to speak 
out on issues that affect them 
in march more than 100 coal miners in the ural mountains city 
of vorkuta struck to protest increased work orders demand 
replacement of the facilitys director and chief economist and 
changes in the salary system 
in april miners stayed underground in the siberian city of 
norilsk to demand a 30 percent wage increase 
in both cases the strikes drew the attention of the government 
ministers in moscow who promised to meet some of the strikers 
demands

prime minister margaret thatcher said today she 
feels a sense of pride and achievement as she looks back on 10 
years in power and that she has no thought of slowing down 
speaking to reporters from the steps of her offices at no 10 
downing street the 63yearold prime minister said there were 
things she might have done differently but that overall britain is 
better off 
the standard of living for almost everyone is higher she 
said i think everyone recognizes that britains standing in the 
world is greater than its been for many a very long year 
when she was asked for a second time how long she hopes to 
remain in power mrs thatcher cut short the questioner and said 
look right now we just carry on and take each day and do our 
very best with it i havent got any better crystal ball than you 
have 
theres no thought of slowing down because weve built a 
marvelous basis and we want to go on she said in remarks 
broadcast live on british broadcasting corp television 
public opinion polls indicate that while most britons respect 
the prime minister many also dislike her and some local elections 
today were expected to be rough going for some of mrs thatchers 
conservatives 
mrs thatcher took office as europes first woman prime minister 
on may 4 1979 when the victory of her conservative party in the 
general election the previous day was declared 
the conservatives ousted the socialist labor government of james 
callaghan after a winter of strikes left the dead unburied and 
garbage piled high in the streets 
she has since won two more terms pursuing a rightwing 
revolution that has emasculated the labor unions and increased 
prosperity for many people 
but critics charge thatcherism made the poor poorer encouraged 
greed and divided the nation 
the independent independent said in an editorial today if 
mrs thatcher does not pause to reflect upon her present course 
she will damage the nation 
the conservatives looked set according to polls to lose a 
welsh parliamentary district in a special election today 
reflecting widespread opposition to her plans for radical reforms 
of the free national health service 
voting was also taking place today in 47 county council 
elections in england and wales with both the conservatives and the 
main opposition labor party likely to gain from a slump in support 
for the squabbling center parties 
local opinion polls in the parliamentary district the vale of 
glamorgan tory territory for 38 years indicated the conservative 
candidate were trailing between 8 and 11 points behind labor 
a harris poll in londons observer a liberal weekly showed 
that although 58 percent of those questioned want mrs thatcher to 
step down now or within a couple of years only 7 percent believe 
she actually will 
in a gallup sounding 67 percent said they dislike mrs thatcher 
personally about the same as the 63 percent who said they respect 
her

plight is a tragedy a human tragedy 
quayle and his wife marilyn traveled more than 2 hours by

secret service agents armed with assault rifles guarded the 
quayle party as the vice president and his wife shook hands and 
touched some of the tens of thousands of people who turned out to 
cheer them in the burning heat 
quayle originally was scheduled to visit site 2 another major 
refugee camp south of site b but sporadic shellings of site 2 over 
the past two weeks prompted officials to cancel that trip 
the last major event on quayles trip the visit to the refugee 
camp underscored his emphasis on promoting us efforts to promote 
a settlement of the decadeold cambodian war and its support for 
noncommunist guerrillas led by prince norodom sihanouk and by son 
sann 
at a departure news conference in bangkok later quayle said the 
united states may supply weapons to those resistance groups in 
order to give them more leverage with both the vietnamesebacked 
government in cambodia and their powerful allies the khmer rouge 
vietnam has promised to pull its forces out of cambodia this 
fall 
now is the time we want to go forward with the one goal an 
independent and free cambodia and the best way to achieve that is

interpreter translated into the cambodian language the plight of 
the cambodian people is something that has been overlooked its a 
tragedy a human tragedy 
afterward the vice president visited a medical center at the 
camp where mothers on bamboo beds gathered their children near

telling quayle that the issue should not be allowed to mar overall 
relations he said the most recent negotiations had proceeded well

the seabrook nh nuclear power plant has 
cleared a final obstacle to winning a lowpower operating license 
later this month but opponents say they will appeal any decision 
to start the reactor 
the financially fragile reactor moved closer to licensing when 
late wednesday the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission said 
it was satisfied that the plant owners could come up with 721 
million in decommissioning costs the money assures the plant would 
be safely taken out of operation should it be tested with 
radioactive fuel but never operated commercially 
the nrc had said the financial decommissioning issue was the 
last in a long series of regulatory obstacles that has prevented 
seabrook from getting its lowpower license for 2 years the 
emotional 20year battle over the seabrook plant has served as a 
rallying point for the antinuclear power movement 
the 6 billion plant could receive the longsought license 
which allows testing at up to 5 percent of capacity as early as 
late next week if the nuclear regulatory commission does not impose 
a stay on the license pending appeals 
the nrc will give opponents five days to file requests for a 
stay and another four days for seabrook officials to respond the 
commissioners said they would rule on stay motions 
expeditiously and that the license would not be issued until 
the nrc has ruled on the requests 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon and other plant 
opponents said they would file for a stay and appeal the case to 
federal court 
but any legal challenge will become moot without an emergency 
stay from either the nrc or the court because seabrook officials 
are ready to act swiftly on lowpower tests 
seabrook spokesman ronald a sher has said plant operators are 
ready to begin a 10day warm up period a precursor to 
lowpower testing within 24 hours of receiving the license 
after that plant officials would conduct 10 days of lowpower 
tests ranging from 001 percent of the plants capacity to 3 
percent capacity it would be the equivalent of running the plant 
at full power for 45 minutes sher said 
sher said seabrook officials do not believe the opponents can 
further delay a lowpower license he predicted the license would 
be issued later this month 
shannon predicted the license issue will end up in court within 
weeks 
in a telephone interview wednesday night the attorney general 
lambasted the nrc staff decision as just another example of 
bureaucrats in washington riding roughshod over our health and 
safety 
shannon said his appeal would be based largely on the financial 
difficulties facing the plants chief owner and the possibility 
that the reactor will never receive a commercial operating license 
the staff decision announced after regular business hours at 6 
pm came just hours after the nrc voted 50 to reject a request 
by massachusetts officials to hold new hearings on the license 
state officials argued that the lack of an approved site where the 
plant could haul its lowlevel radioactive waste could increase the 
projects cost and should be examined 
to meet the decommissioning fund requirement seabrook owners 
paid aetna casualty and surety co of hartford conn 85 million 
to insure any part of the estimated 721 million that the owners 
could not come up with themselves the staff ruled wednesday that 
the bond guarantee was acceptable

a secret 1949 experiment at the hanford 
nuclear reservation released about twice as much radioactive gas as 
scientists had predicted beforehand according to a newly 
declassified report 
the report said the socalled green run experiment released 
about 7780 curies of radioactive iodine and about 20000 curies of 
xenon133 a gas 
by contrast the 1979 three mile island accident the worst 
commercial nuclear accident in the united states emitted 15 to 24 
curies of radioactive iodine into the pennsylvania countryside 
scientists had estimated in 1949 that the test would release 
about 4000 curies of iodine and 7900 curies of xenon the 
increased radiation measurements may have been caused by an 
unstable weather inversion over the region the report said 
the spokane chronicle and spokesmanreview two of several 
newspapers that requested the reports release published details

the dec 2 1949 experiment the only known nonaccidental 
release of radiation in hanfords postworld war ii history spread 
radiation in a 40by 200mile plume to spokane and as far south as 
klamath falls ore near the california border 
its not known how much radiation residents actually were 
exposed to since the public was never notified and no followup 
health studies were done 
scientists are now starting a study to see if hanford emissions 
in the 1940s and 50s including the green run have led to an 
increase in thyroid disease in the area 
some details of the green run test were included in a hanford 
nuclear reservation environmental monitoring report that was among 
19000 pages of previously secret documents made public by the 
department of energy in 1986 but a more detailed 120page report 
on other aspects of the experiment was not released until this 
week some segments of the report were deleted for security 
reasons the government said 
the green run experiment was apparently conducted to help 
develop efforts to detect emerging military plutonium production in 
the soviet union the contamination exceeded the atomic energy 
commissions tolerance thresholds for iodine131 on vegetation 
by tens of thousands of times on the nuclear reservation and by 
hundreds of times in nearby communities

disabled tuna boat and a crew member who abandoned the vessel told 
the coast guard his companions were overcome by fumes of rotting 
fish 
lawrence moon a yap islander found drifting in a life raft 
tuesday told officials he abandoned the tuna boat margaret g after 
the fumes felled the two other men in a matter of seconds said 
coast guard spokesman keith spangler 
spangler said the men may have been overcome by hydrogen 
sulfide which is produced by rotting organic material 
the coast guard began towing the 85foot seattlebased vessel 
to hawaii on wednesday said another coast guard spokesman david 
goff the 300mile trip could take three to four days because the 
tuna boat has rudder problems he said 
the coast guard investigation was complicated by the fact that 
hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible spangler said 
moon who said he joined the margaret g before it left american 
samoa on april 23 told authorities the boats refrigeration system 
was not operating when it left the us territory about 2300 miles 
south of hawaii the boat was carrying 13 to 15 tons of tuna it had 
been unable to sell in port goff said 
moon said the three crew members dumped five to six tons of 
rotten fish into the pacific ocean between april 25 and 27 but had 
to stop when the heat and smell became too intense 
the skipper was overcome by fumes sunday when he went into the 
fish well and the other crewman was also overcome when he went to 
help the skipper moon said 
fearing the fumes endangered his life moon boarded a life raft 
monday after the ships electric generator failed his raft was 
spotted tuesday by a coast guard plane following an emergency 
distress beacon signal 
yap part of the federated states of micronesia is about 540 
miles southwest of guam

a us immigration official granted political 
asylum to a nicaraguan immigrant after the man won 53 million in 
the florida lottery 
justo ricardo somarriba a 350anhour hardware store clerk 
who entered the country illegally in 1987 picked up his first 
annual check of 240000 in tallahassee on monday after picking all 
six numbers in floridas lotto drawing saturday 
on wednesday after us immigration and naturalization service 
officials revealed that the state department had failed to support 
somarribas request for political asylum ins district director 
perry rivkind reviewed the case and decided somarriba and his 
family deserved legal residency 
i never expected this would happen in this country 
somarriba said of his familys newfound protectedimmigrant status 
as well as its financial windfall its just great 
somarriba probably would face repression if he returned to 
nicaragua said rivkind adding this has nothing to do with the 
jackpot 
he was a teacher in the government education department and 
there is no question he resisted sandinista propagandizing in the 
school system rivkind said that clearly gives hims a 
wellfounded fear of persecution 
rivkind then joked now that he is a captialist i think the 
marxists would like him even less 
somarriba quit his job after confirming his winnings and said he 
hoped to use the money to bring the rest of his family from 
nicaragua and open his own hardware store in the united states 
like about 40000 other nicaraguans in florida somarriba was 
employed under a special work permit while waiting for his asylum 
application to be processed 
early last year the state department refused to support 
somarribas petition saying it had insufficient information 
rivkind said the state department which previously made 
yesorno recommendations on almost all such applications has 
lately avoided making decisions on about half of the requests sent 
its way 
even if somarribas request had been denied however it is 
unlikely he would have been deported 
deportation notices must be approved by the justice department 
and so far the agency has returned only convicted criminals to 
nicaragua said rivkind adding the remaining deportation requests 
are simply stalled in washington 
in addition anyone who is denied asylum can appeal that 
decision a process that usually takes one to two years 
lottery officials said even if he hadnt received asylum he 
would have gotten to keep the money 
somarriba from masaya nicaragua about 90 miles south of 
managua entered the united states in march 1987 by crossing the 
rio grande near brownsville texas said richard smith deputy ins 
director 
he lives with his wife maria elena and three children rosa 
elena 9 maria 7 and yuliza 3

poor children are more likely than wealthier 
children to be hospitalized when they are sick and hospitalization 
rates vary dramatically between cities a study has found 
in their review of three cities researchers found boston 
youngsters were about 2 times more likely than children in 
rochester ny to be admitted to hospitals while those in new 
haven conn fell between the two 
despite bostons higher rate however it was still below the 
national average 
if the general quality of care is no worse in rochester than 
elsewhere other cities may be able to lower their number of 
hospital beds and the cost of inpatient health care of chidren 
the doctors wrote 
the researchers noted that poor children are more likely than 
wealthier youngsters to be put in the hospital when they get sick 
which may help explain the differences in hospitalization rates 
among the cities 
the study speculated that bostons hospitalization rates were 
higher than rochesters because the city is poorer they said poor 
youngsters may have more severe illness and less access to 
outpatient care doctors may also be more likely to admit them 
because of concern about the chidrens home care 
earlier research has shown regional differences in hospital 
admissions for adults 
the study was conducted by dr james m perrin of massachusetts 
general hospital with colleagues from childrens hospital in boston 
and dartmouth medical school it was published wednesday in the new 
england journal of medicine 
the study was based on 1982 data and the researchers said they 
assumed that hospitalization rates have fallen since then 
boston hospitalization rates for upper respiratory infections 
ear aches croup and poisoning were more than five times higher 
than in rochester however hospitalization for surgery was similar 
in the three cities 
the researchers noted that if boston children had been 
hospitalized at the same rate as those in rochester only 1858 of 
the citys 4927 medical admissions in 1982 would have occurred 
the three cities were chosen for the study because they all have 
hospitals affiliated with medical schools

rally today and arrested 433 people after authorities stung by the 
deaths of six riot police warned they would take emergency 
measures to halt violent protests 
about 8000 riot police blanketed the downtown area in a major 
show of strength to block a demonstration called by striking 
workers and dissidents to denounce the government of president roh 
taewoo 
squads of police in green fatigues visored helmets and armed 
with shields and nightsticks patrolled the streets dispersing 
onlookers and keeping the area clear police vehicles roamed the 
streets and squads of troopers were at every major intersection 
officials said 433 students and workers were arrested after 
being detained during street checks roadblocks turned back about 
800 people trying to reach the rally site 
about 50 radical students yelling antigovernment slogans staged 
a brief protest in the city center but fled as soon as riot police 
arrived 
they talk big but they dont dare come out said a grinning 
officer 
dissident leaders said they expected up to 50000 people would 
participate in the rally in this industrial port city 120 miles 
southeast of seoul 
but the enormous display of police strength frightened workers 
and no one was prepared to come onto the streets they said how 
can we march for our rights when there are so many police said 
one protest leader 
workers unable to march because of the police presence staged 
sitdown protests at factories the sitins were peaceful and 
witnesses said there were no confrontations with police 
in seoul a 24yearold union leader at a garment factory doused 
himself with kerosene and set himself on fire today to protest poor 
working conditions news reports said he was hospitalized in 
critical condition along with a second worker whose clothes 
accidently caught fire

government but they have little public support because of their 
violent tactics and extreme views however the government is 
concerned about their efforts to build an antigovernment alliance 
with striking workers

their six comrades who were killed wednesday in the nearby city of 
pusan during an attempt to free five police officers held hostage 
by radical college students

antigovernment protests and strikes that have hit south korea in

protests it was the worst loss of life related to political 
violence since a 1980 antigovernment uprising in kwangju left at 
least 192 people dead 
police said today that they would charge five student leaders 
with murder and arson charges which could be punishable by death 
police said lesser charges would be filed against 40 other students 
also today the governing and opposition parties agreed to enact 
a law against firebombs 
in seoul hundreds of radical students shouting down with the 
roh regime marched on at least three campuses but the students 
avoided clashes with riot police stationed outside apparently 
sensing public anger at the killing of police officers in pusan 
we will go ahead with our antiroh campaign but this time we 
think we have to restrain ourselves a student leader said 
government leaders say strikes have already cost the economy 
more than 3 billion in lost production this year 
roh a former general won presidential elections in december 
1987 after rival opposition leaders split the opposition vote he 
has helped introduce broad democratic reforms but the radicals 
claim the government is a front for military rule and assert there 
have been no reforms 
also today about 500 farmers and students staged a peaceful 
protest march in downtown chonan 40 miles south of seoul to 
protest us agricultural imports according to yonhap the south 
korean news agency 
another 700 students shouting drive out yankees battled 
riot police with firebombs and rocks in the central city of taejon 
to oppose the reported move of us bases from seoul to taejon

states has agreed to relocate us barracks in seoul by the 
mid1990s news reports said they would be moved to areas around 
taejon 
radical students have demanded withdrawal of the 43000 american 
troops stationed in south korea contending the soldiers hamper 
unification with communist north korea

a top vietnamese official said in an 
interview published today that vietnam should have immediately 
condemned the communist khmer rouge which killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians in 19751978 
but vietnam corrected that mistake by invading cambodia in late 
1978 and ousting the khmer rouge government foreign minister 
nguyen co thach said in an interview published in the bangkok post 
he spoke wednesday in bangkok before returning to hanoi 
vietnams communists helped form the cambodian communist party 
they gave crucial military aid and direction to the khmer rouge 
whose insurgents won a fiveyear civil war and overthrew the 
usbacked lon nol government in april 1975 
over the next three years and eight months the khmer rouge 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and 
slave labor camps in its attempt to fashion an agrarian society 
along communist lines 
vietnam did nothing until 1978 when it invaded cambodia 
following border attacks in which the khmer rouge killed thousands 
of vietnamese villagers 
after thach condemned the crimes of the khmer rouge led by pol 
pot the interviewer said but the vietnamese did not condemn pol 
pot before 
yes it is our mistake thach replied but we have 
corrected our mistake by military means 
and now what is the position of the western countries he 
continued they condemn them only by words not by deeds and 
when we condemn them by force they condemn vietnam so it is a 
pity 
some asian and western nations say the khmer rouge must be part 
of a future coalition government because it might otherwise try to 
take power by military means some reports have said the guerrillas 
have stocked up arms for an allout offensive after vietnam 
completes its promised troop withdrawal in september 
hun sen premier of the vietnameseinstalled government in 
cambodia tried to rule out any future role for the khmer rouge at 
this weeks talks in indonesia with resistance leaders prince 
norodom sihanouk and son sann 
the two noncommunist leaders are allied with the khmer rouge in 
the resistance coalition they say they hate the khmer rouge but 
need its 30000 to 40000 guerrillas 
thach welcomed the results of the talks in indonesia 
now is is clear they have made some progress to have 
appropriate reconciliation formula and mechanism on the basis of 
the reality in kampuchea cambodia thach said i think it is 
a good direction

the flood of central american refugees trying 
to cross the us border into texas has slowed significantly thanks 
to help from mexico federal immigration authorities say 
border security has been tightened in south texas by the 
immigration and naturalization service ins officials say in 
addition mexican authorities have arrested 13000 central american 
refugees in the last six months up from 12000 the prevous year 
the ins says 
james l buck deputy immigration commissioner told reporters 
wednesday that mexico has reinstituted checkpoints along that 
countrys southern border and authorities are randomly stopping 
motorists to spot illegal aliens 
buck noted that the number of border arrests of illegal aliens 
in south texas has dropped from 200 to 300 a day to about 50 daily 
since a 400member ins task force was assigned to port isabel 
texas on feb 21 
the task force was set up to help stop the explosion of 
political asylum applications from central americans at the border 
between june and december of last year the ins was receiving an 
average of 5000 asylum applications a month 
most of the refugees were not eligible for political asylum 
because they couldnt satisfy the ins requirement that they 
demonstrate a wellbased fear of persecution 
as many as 2500 were detained at the port isabel facility 
which now holds 1500 aliens awaiting adjudication of their asylum 
claims another 1700 have been deported ins officials say 
the number of asylum applications submitted at the border has 
also dropped from 200 daily to only a handful buck said 
if current trends continue probably by the end of the summer 
we will begin to see this entire task force sized down 
significantly buck said 
ins commissioner alan nelson said ins has received justice 
department clearance to begin deportation of 100 nicaraguans who 
were denied political asylum 
under an attorney generals order nicaraguan refugees whose 
asylum applications are rejected at ins are screened by a justice 
department unit before deportation proceedings are instituted 
nelson said about 16 percent of nicaraguans seeking asylum have 
received it compared to 4 percent from el salvador 
nelson meanwhile credited the employer sanction provisions of 
the 1986 immigration reform and control act with helping to reduce 
the overall number of arrests along the 1000mile usmexican 
border 
the ins has assessed 7 million in fines to employers accused of 
hiring illegal aliens and collected 16 million nelson said 
nelson noted ins and border patrol agents arrested 16 million 
illegal aliens in 1986 the year before the immigration law was 
enacted since then the yearly totals have declined significantly 
he said 
in the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year arrests were 
down about a third from 1988 when the total for 12 months was 
940670 nelson said 
the trend continues to demonstrate that the law is working 
nelson said 
under the oneyear amnesty program for onceillegal aliens the 
ins is gearing up to process nearly 31 million requests from 
foreigners to become permanent us residents 
the application deadline for amnesty was a year ago today since 
then the ins has approved nearly 18 million applications for 
temporary residency while denying about 70000 
it continues to process the balance of the applications for 
temporary residence 
aliens may apply for permanent residency 18 months after being 
given legal status they must apply for permanent residency within 
a year of becoming eligible for face deportation 
advocacy groups contend the ins isnt doing enough to spread the 
word about the impending deadlines 
but ins officials say 60 percent of those who are now eligible 
to apply have done so and they expect the application rate to reach 
97 percent by the time the program ends 
nelson said the agency has received 290000 applications so far 
ins officials say computerized mailings make advertising 
campaigns unnecessary because we are reaching out directly to 
these people said richard norton associate commissioner for 
examinations

after he was strapped into the electric chair adams was asked 
if he had a final statement before the black hood was pulled over 
his head 
my pastor will be making my last statement for me he 
replied in a strong clear voice 
his pastor wj barfield left the prison without talking to 
witnesses or reporters but was contacted later at his church of god 
in newberry 
barfield said adams left a handwritten final statement that 
said in part i hope and pray that all the new and reopened 
wounds will be healed quickly after my passing my death is the 
lords will and i am now with my lord and savior jesus christ in 
heaven 
adams statement made no direct reference to his crime but said 
he forgives all those have had anything against me he said the 
death penalty was against christs teaching 
the electricity in the death chamber was turned on at 704 am 
and adams was pronounced dead five minutes later 
adams was the second person executed in florida this year and 
the 21st in the state and 108th in the nation since the us 
supreme courts 1976 ruling that restored capital punishment 
in january confessed serial killer ted bundy was executed for 
the slaying of kimberly diane leach a lake city schoolgirl 
the court late wednesday voted 72 against an emergency request 
for a delay and turned down a formal appeal for a review of the 
death sentence 
adams was under his fourth death warrant for the jan 23 1978 
death of trisa gail thornley a thirdgrader last seen on her way 
home from school in ocala in central florida 
her mutilated and naked body was found in a plastic bag about 
two months later by hunters in a remote area three miles from her 
home 
an obscene phone call to the girls home was traced to adams 
home and he eventually admitted picking her up he later said he 
recalled she screamed and he placed his hand over her mouth to 
silence her but not killing her an autopsy showed she suffocated 
adams was a state prison guard at marion correctional 
institution from early 1977 until his arrest in march 1978 
adams had been under one death warrant in 1984 and two in 1986 
after psychiatrists ruled him mentally competent to be executed 
state law requires that inmates be able to understand why they are 
being punished before they can be executed 
his mother marjorie adams of trenton fla wrote a letter to 
thengov bob graham in 1979 appealing for clemency 
you as a parent must know what dreams you have for your child 
mine are shattered i once thought as a lot of others think that 
the death penalty was the right thing i only hope and pray that no 
one has to have their thinking changed as i have i love my son no 
matter what happens and would gladly die that he may live she

the house and senate worked today to finish 
similar 12 trillion federal budgets for next year but the 
chairman of the houses taxwriting committee says republicans 
might delay necessary revenueraising measures 
the house by voice vote approved an amendment adding 175 
million to its budgets veterans health care allocation which was 
already above president bushs recommendation 
both chambers planned votes on several amendments through the 
day but they expected to finish action tonight without 
dramatically altering the fiscal 1990 spending blueprint 
the budgets reflect a pact reached last month between bush and 
congressional leaders which promises to shrink next years deficit 
to just above 99 billion in part by collecting an additional 53 
billion in taxes 
a partisan showdown looms over the composition of those taxes 
bush claims 48 billion of that can be raised by actually 
cutting a tax he says slashing capital gains taxes would cause the 
economy to grow with tax revenues growing proportionately 
democrats including house ways and means committee chairman 
dan rostenkowski of illinois have called the idea a moneyloser 
that would do little more than help the rich they want to raise 
the funds in unspecified other ways 
speaking on the house floor rostenkowski said that democrats on 
his panel would not seek any new revenues unless republicans went 
along with bushs no new taxes campaign pledge democrats are 
leery of being depicted as the party that favors higher taxes 
i will not encourage or support a revenue increase that does 
not have the support of the president and a majority of members of 
both sides of the aisle on my committee he said 
rostenkowski told a reporter he expected bush to cajole 
republican lawmakers if necessary to support any tax deal reached 
between the administration and congressional democrats 
its the presidents budget rostenkowski said the 
president is going to have to do it 
rostenkowskis senate counterpart senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas told his colleagues that his panel 
may propose tax increases surpassing 53 billion because it might 
also approve some costly tax breaks 
those tax breaks which cost the government revenues might 
include the researchanddevelopment tax credit and a cut in the 
surtax for catastrophic health care insurance bensten said he did 
not say which tax increases he favors 
on wednesday the senate picked its way through a series of 
amendments approving one adding 94 million for aids research and 
another shifting 100 million to law enforcement from other 
domestic agency budgets it also went on record against gas tax 
increases approving by voice vote a nonbinding provision that the 
current 9centpergallon levy be left alone 
in a 6431 vote that illustrated the support they have for their 
spending plan the chambers leaders also defeated an effort by 
sen paul simon dill to transfer 3 billion from defense to 
education programs 
we made an agreement and i believe it is a responsible and 
fair agreement said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine 
in the house legislators spent their day arguing the merits of 
their 117 trillion plan with many members arguing that it was 
the best that could be achieved considering bushs reluctance to 
raise taxes and democrats aversion to domestic spending cuts 
were left with having to work around the edges which we 
did said house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
in an effort to reduce this years expected 163 billion 
shortfall both chambers are relying heavily on rosy economic 
projections bookkeeping gimmicks such as shifting spending out of 
fiscal 1990 and oneshot steps like selling federal assets 
they would allow 2992 billion in defense spending next year 
25 billion more than this year expenditures for foreign aid 
would reach 17 billion and 142 billion would be raised from 
taxes higher user fees and asset sales 
expected growth in programs that provide automatic benefits to 
recipients such as federal pensions would be cut by 83 billion 
among those savings would be 23 billion from medicare although 
lawmakers say they expect the cuts to come from payments to doctors 
and hospitals not from beneficiaries 
the greatest difference between the senate and house is in how 
they distribute money among most domestic programs the house 
favored education health and veterans programs while the senate 
placed more emphasis on agriculture energy and law enforcement

a man is being investigated in the 
alleged assaults of as many as 17 prostitutes in an area where nine 
women have been found dead along the highways since last summer a 
court document says 
state police filed an affidavit in new bedford district court 
last month to obtain a warrant to search the mans house and truck 
the affidavit said police had interviewed 12 women described as 
prostitutes who identified the man from photographs five other 
women also were believed to have been assaulted 
three of the women said the man choked them and two said they 
were choked into unconsciousness according to the affidavit 
reported wednesday by wjartv in providence ri and today by the 
boston herald and the boston globe 
one woman said she saw a cord or rope in the mans vehicle and 
thought the man was going to choke her with it according to the 
affidavit 
the bodies of nine women have been found since july along 
highways in the new bedford area three were strangled according 
to death certificates the cause of death was not determined for 
the other six women 
authorities believe the women were killed by the same person or 
persons and all nine had ties to the drug community in new 
bedford some had turned to prostitution 
two new bedford women missing since last summer are also feared 
to be victims 
the 26yearold freetown man whose home and truck were searched 
april 19 one day after the affidavit was filed for the search 
warrant has not been charged in either the deaths or the assaults 
state police said the search found bloodstains on the dashboard 
and seat in the truck and that hair fibers clothes and four 
knives were seized the papers and television station reported 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina has refused to 
identify any suspects in the investigation into the killings 
but tuesday after testifying before the grand jury 
investigating the killings margaret medeiros 22 a selfdescribed 
prostitute told reporters that police had told her the man was a 
suspect 
she also said the man had tried to break my neck and told 
her im going to do to you what i did to them other bitches 
the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant reportedly was 
based on interviews conducted last month by state troopers and new 
bedford detectives investigating the deaths of the nine women but 
the affidavit did not mention the killings 
the man whose home and truck were searched has told the boston 
herald he had nothing to do with the assaults and was being linked 
unfairly to the killings 
if it was me i wouldnt be talking to you right now he 
said

an international conference today 
agreed to safeguard company secrets on production of chemicals that 
harm the ozone layer despite objections from environmentalist 
groups 
the corporate secrecy issue caused fiery debate at the 
unsponsored meeting reviewing the 1987 montreal protocol 
the montreal agreement ratified by 36 countries pledges 
drastic cuts in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons or 
cfcs which are blamed for breaking down the ozone layer 
the secrecy resolution put forward by the united states and the 
12 nations of the european economic community won unanimous 
approval delegates said 
greenpeace delegate karen coulter said the environmental group 
feared that greater secrecy could help countries hide the 
production of banned chemicals under the montreal protocol the 
signatory nations must report to the un environmental program on 
the production consumption and trade in five chlorofluorocarbons 
and three halon gases 
greenpeace wanted public disclosure of these reports 
but industrial countries were insisting on more discretion in 
deciding what figures should be made public ms coulter said some 
western countries said full disclosure which could give one 
company information about anothers production could be against 
the law 
canada like the united states has national legislation 
protecting commercial confidentiality if the companies give us 
data we cant release it said a chisholm head of canadas 
atmospheric research directorate 
we asked the meeting how is it that commercial 
confidentiality can override environmental concern said ms 
coulter 
delegates from 86 countries and nearly 100 nongovernmental 
organizations are attending the conference which is to update the 
1987 document requiring signatories to halve by 1999 their 
production of five chlorofluorocarbons and three halons the 
chemicals break down the earths protective ozone shield 
increasing the risk of skin cancers and eye disease 
it was the second contentious issue reported from the 
closeddoor meeting on wednesday the countries split over how to 
help third world countries pay for technology to replace the 
equipment that emits harmful chemicals 
the united states canada britain japan and other nations that 
would be the largest donors opposed a recommendation to set up a 
special fund 
us delegate stephen seidel of the environment protection 
agency said the fund could cost so much in administration that it 
would siphon off money better spent in bilateral aid projects a 
draft resolution was submitted today that would delay the question 
at least until next year

a federal judge today refused to prohibit 
the lac du flambeau band of chippewa indians from spearing all of 
its allowable fish catch on some northern wisconsin lakes 
us district judge barbara crabb said she would hear further 
arguments from the state on the issue and she said she would hear 
arguments friday on gov tommy g thompsons request that she stop 
all chippewa indian spearfishing by saturday 
an agreement to cut the fish take was reached at a meeting more 
than two weeks ago between thompson and leaders of the six chippewa 
bands but after increasing harassment of spearfishing indians by 
sport fishermen the tribal chief said tuesday that the band might 
begin taking 100 percent of the fish that biologists consider safe 
to take from a lake 
the thursday hearing was a telephone conference hookup among the 
state attorney general the judge and a lawyer representing the 
indians 
assistant state attorney general stephen nicks told the judge 
the prohibition order on lac du flambeau spearing was necessary to 
protect the fish he said if the band carried out its threat to 
increase the take of walleye it would complicate state efforts to 
set limits for the hookandline season for the general public 
opening saturday 
crabb said the chippewa appeared to be giving up something to 
which they were already entitled in the agreement with thompson 
she said she wondered why the lac du flambeau would want to step 
aside from a right they have had for more than 100 years under 
19th century treaties 
tribal chairman michael g allen sr warned the state tuesday 
that the band could retaliate against future violent 
antispearfishing protests by taking 100 percent of the safe catch 
from any lakes where incidents take place 
nine arrests were reported wednesday night including two at big 
arbor vitae lake where about 300 people gathered on land and about 
30 boats congregated on the lake to protest the offreservation 
spearing 
more than 100 arrests have been made since the spearing season 
began april 23 this is the fifth year wisconsins six chippewa 
tribes have speared fish off reservation since a federal court 
ruled the tribe retained the right to hunt fish trap and gather 
wild grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the 
united states 
unlike in previous springs this year has no specific date for 
the end of the season the fish are most easily speared during 
spring when they spawn is shallow waters

a twoday strike at the university of 
california at berkeley is aiming for national recognition of a 
burgeoning movement on the countrys campuses to recognize graduate 
assistants as employees 
we do the majority of educating on most major campuses said 
lawrence coates a 32yearold classroom assistant who said he 
barely survives on a university stipend 
the average student assistant at berkeley receives about 10000 
annually in living expenses for one of the most expensive regions 
in the country 
were teaching the bulk of classes we give out the grades 
students come to us with their problems is that a teacher or what 
but wheres the respect for my work coates asked 
union representatives claimed hundreds of classes were canceled 
for the twoday strike that was concluding today university 
officials called the protest largely symbolic although they did 
not check the number of canceled classes 
at the start of the school day wednesday placardcarrying 
demonstrators greeted students and university workers at major 
entrances to campus handing out yellow armbands and chanting 
hey hey ho ho union bustings got to go the campus 
appeared unusually quiet 
elsewhere around the country student protests continued over 
various issues 
about 45 students occupying offices at the university of 
massachusetts in amherst for the third time in two weeks refused to 
leave today despite warnings that administrators were preparing to 
remove them forcibly they were protesting pentagonfunded research 
some 75 students had spent the night in the research building 
but 30 left voluntarily this morning the warning was issued in a 
45minute meeting the protesters had with the universitys public 
safety director arthur hilson 
in new york city some students promised amnesty ended their 
sitins against proposed tuition increases while city university 
officials struggled with an 18 million budget deficit but other 
students held fast saying they would occupy administration 
buildings and offices as long as gov mario cuomo refuses to meet 
for a facetoface discussion cuomo vetoed the tuition hike 
tuesday 
in ohio about 50 students held a candlelight vigil early today 
marking the 19th anniversary of the kent state university 
shootings ohio national guardsmen opened fire on demonstrators 
during an antiwar protest on may 4 1970 killing four students 
and wounding nine 
several hundred students at middlebury college in vermont set 
up pickets outside classrooms and administration buildings today to 
protest a planned 117 percent fees increase for next year 
tuition room and board would be raised from 17000 to 19000 
betsy etchells executive assistant to college president olin 
robison said the increase was set by trustees and would not be 
changed 
in atlanta 40 to 50 mercer university students faculty and 
alumni hoping to pressure school trustees to keep their college of 
arts and sciences open ended a 24hour readin this morning 
and immediately began a 24hour prayer vigil 
last month the trustees faced with a multimilliondollar 
deficit voted 315 to close the liberal arts college in june 1990 
the atlanta campus would continue to house other university 
functions including a pharmacy school and a graduate business 
school 
the dispute at berkeley and many other universities is whether 
schools should continue to view classroom and laboratory assistants 
as scholars on stipends or employees with a right to collective 
bargaining 
university of california teaching assistants handle 58 percent 
of classroom work involving undergraduate students while research 
assistants do about half the laboratory work according to a study 
by the association for graduate student employees 
the berkeleybased union of 3200 graduate assistants 
affiliated with the united auto workers is in the vanguard of 
studenteducators nationwide who say they are underpaid overworked 
and often forced to go without health and other benefits the 
assistants also would like to negotiate such issues as class size 
berkeley spokesman tom debley said the university believes the 
work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwined 
with educational experience 
during the last decade major universities in at least five 
states florida wisconsin michigan oregon and new jersey have 
recognized graduate assistants as employees 
the debate has cropped up at many more campuses and a victory at 
berkeley one of the nations most prestigious universities could 
legitimize graduate students demands said david lambert an 
association executive board member 
teaching assistants at the university of wisconsin in madison 
won collective bargaining rights from the legislature in 1985 now 
represented by a union affiliated with the american federation of 
teachers they are negotiating their second contract 
at the university of michigan in ann arbor the university and 
its newly organized teaching assistants reached a collective 
bargaining agreement earlier this year that gives assistants a 14 
percent pay raise over the next two years 
the university of oregon in eugene rejected graduate students 
efforts to unionize in 1975 but the state employment relations 
board ruled in the students favor in december 1976 and a local was 
formed the following year they have negotiated twoyear contracts 
with the university since then 
at the university of massachusetts the coordinating committee 
of the teaching assistants union voted last week to affiliate with 
the united auto workers 
at berkeley the union has been seeking recognition since 1983 
in a 21 ruling last week the state public employment relations 
board said that a 1979 law forbids graduate students from being 
treated as employees because their work duties are part of 
scholarly training 
the association plans to appeal the decision to a state 
appellate court 
despite the labor boards ruling legal precedent exists in 
california for the students demands after losing a court battle 
that reached the state supreme court the university of california 
san francisco recently decided to recognize the san francisco 
interns and residents association as a bargaining unit for some 
graduate students at its hospital

women who give birth to twins reduce their 
risk of contracting breast cancer according to researchers 
although scientists have known for some time that giving birth 
reduces a womans risk of contracting breast cancer a joint study 
released today by the albany medical center and yale university 
found that mothers of twins may get far greater protection against 
breast cancer mothers of twins receive a double dose of 
alphafetoprotein an estrogenopposing protein manufactured by 
the liver according to the study 
estrogen is considered a major factor in the growth of 40 
percent of breast cancers according to researchers 
the study found that women who gave birth to twins during their 
last pregnancy had an incidence of breast cancer equal to that of 
women who had given birth to six single children 
the finding appearing in the may issue of the american journal 
of epidemiology also showed that this extraprotective effect may 
vanish if a mother of twins later gives birth to a single child 
the results were gathered by reviewing the reproductive 
histories of more than 9000 women ages 20 to 55 about half of the 
subjects had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer

house republican whip newt gingrich said today 
that americans would not tolerate turning over the panama canal to 
an administrator handpicked by a dictator 
echoing bush administration statements predicting fraud in 
sundays panamanian national elections gingrich said theres a 
very grave danger i would say almost a probability that the 
dictatorship plans to steal the election 
gingrich said that during a white house meeting of republican 
leaders with bush there was considerable discussion about the 
concern that all of us feel about the possibility the elections 
will be rigged to keep strongman gen manuel antonio noriega in 
charge 
gingrich said a continuing dictatorship rule in panama could 
jeopardize consummation of the panama canal treaties ratified by 
the senate in 1979 gingrich stopped short however of calling for 
the united states to abrogate the treaties 
under terms of the pacts the united states is scheduled to 
relinquish the strategic canal to panama in 1999 the us 
government is scheduled this year however to approve a panamanian 
selected by that government to be the canals administrator 
gingrich said that people committed to democracy in central 
america must figure out how the people of panama can regain 
control over their country and have fair and honest elections 
bush said in a speech earlier this week that it is evident 
that the regime is ready to resort to massive election fraud in 
order to remain in power 
he said the united states will not recognize the results of a 
fraudulent election engineered simply to keep noriega in power 
but the president didnt say what other steps he might take in the 
wake of an election considered to be fraudulent 
gingrich talking to reporters in the white house driveway said 
he favors making clear to the people of panama that we very much 
want to work to implement the treaty only with a dulyelected 
government thats democratic and thats honest 
the us aim he said should be to serve notice that a phony 
election stolen by a dictatorship does not constitute the kind of 
sovereign government that the united states had in mind in terms of 
having treaty relations with panama 
i think it is inconceivable that the american people would 
tolerate allowing noriega either directly or through a puppet to 
appoint the administrator of the panama canal gingrich said i 
cant imagine that the american people would tolerate that its a 
very real and very serious danger

taxis did a landoffice business today and 
private vehicles gave lifts to commuters after the government 
refused to rescind its decision to fire 23000 city bus workers who 
went on strike 
hundreds of buses from the neighboring state of mexico were 
brought in to cover the most heavily used routes of the bus system 
which carries an estimated 2 million riders a day 
authorities said military vehicles might be pressed into service 
if needed 
downtown streets appeared less congested than normal without the 
big yellow buses belching black diesel fumes but the state buses 
were charging about 16 cents a ride four times the regular fare 
the government fired city bus drivers mechanics and 
administrative workers who staged a oneday walkout wednesday over 
demands for a 50 percent wage increase 
the workers called off the walkout after they were fired but 
the government refused to rehire them and said it would move ahead 
with plans to reorganize the bus line 
the workers action came after the government offered 
concessions to public school teachers who have been striking for 
nearly three weeks 
the bus workers salaries average more than 9000 a year the 
highest in the country for employees of a municipal service 
teachers average 1700 a year 
president carlos salinas de gortaris office said concessions 
granted to teachers would not be extended to other public employees 
because teachers had been left behind in past years 
the presidents statement did not mention bus workers but said 
widespread raises could revive severe inflation 
enrique jackson city transportation coordinator told a news 
conference the bus workers could apply for jobs in the new system 
he did not say if there would be spots for all of them 
he said service under the reorganization should be back to 
normal next week 
city spokesman jose luis manjarrez said that because the bus 
strike was declared illegal in advance by the federal labor 
mediation board employees knew they faced dismissal 
the board acted after the bus workers rejected a 14 percent 
increase in wages and benefits 
the government had increased its offer of an 18 percent raise in 
teachers wages and benefits to 25 percent talks on extending that 
offer to nonteaching employees and on union democracy continued 
wednesday 
the buses are part of a system that includes a subway jitneys 
and private bus lines in the city of 19 million city buses charge 
100 pesos or about 4 cents a ride 
extra police have been assigned to handle crowds at subway 
stations and idle government vehicles mobilized to pick up riders 
for free 
a communique from mayor manuel camacho solis office said that 
under preliminary plans for the bus line reorganization workers 
are to become part owners and operate more independently 
it appeared a fare increase might come with the reorganization 
salinas has started a campaign to make stateowned companies 
profitable or get rid of them 
alfonso macin a city spokesman said the fare for the 
reorganized system would be agreed upon without the union in the 
middle

charges against speaker jim wright will 
probably go to trial before the house ethics committee late this 
month and will take seven to 10 days to complete the panels 
chairman said today 
unless there is agreement between the lawyers for wright 
dtexas and the committee to do otherwise the process will begin 
with a presentation of witnesses and other evidence by the 
committees special outside counsel richard phelan 
wrights lawyer would then have a chance to offer rebuttal 
evidence and bring wright to the stand for a personal defense 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said he expected the 
disciplinary hearing the triallike proceeding at which the panel 
decides whether the 69 ethics charges against wright have been 
proved to begin the latter part of this month 
dixon told reporters the committee has not yet decided whether 
to waive its rules against televising the hearing but added that he 
thought we should adhere to the rules wrights supporters 
believe television coverage would not be favorable to him and thus 
oppose it 
the ethics panel continued today to interview investors in a 
texas gas drilling venture that made a hefty profit for wright last 
year dixon said the interviews were progressing more slowly than 
expected and could continue friday 
on wednesday the panel interviewed san antonio businessman 
morris jaffe and geologist doug prestridge both involved in the 
deal last year that turned 9120 into 340000 over a fivemonth 
period for an investment partnership in which wright dtexas held 
a 50 percent stake 
today the panel began talking to maryln cherry jaffes 
bookkeeper it also was scheduled to talk to jaffes son doug who 
is president of the family enterprises and to dave myers who 
supplied the drilling equipment for the well 
there are still a lot of unresolved questions rep john t 
myers of indiana the committees senior republican said during a 
break in wednesdays daylong closeddoor hearing 
myers said the continuing investigation was distracting 
committee staff from the task of preparing for wrights 
disciplinary hearing 
but dixon defended his panel against wrights criticism tuesday 
that the probe had become a moving target and impossible to 
defend against 
the record of the committee shows we have tried to rigidly 
adhere to the rules dixon said wright will in an appropriate 
time have a chance to respond to all the charges 
dixon and other committee members declined to discuss details of 
the closeddoor testimony but stanley brand the washington lawyer 
for the investors said it largely covered the same territory as a 
23page statement on the deal he issued earlier this week 
that document justified the transaction as a legitimate business 
venture and noted that the remaining partners in the deal plan to 
drill another well believing substantial gas deposits remain to be 
tapped it was not brands statement contended a gift to wright 
designed to gain favor and influence over legislation 
the jaffes have been competing to sell the air force a new 
trainer aircraft produced by one of their companies jaffe 
aerospace 
when it announced last week it was charging wright with 69 house 
rules violations the ethics committee said it was continuing to 
investigate the gas venture known as the sabine lake project after 
its location near the louisianatexas line 
as the ethics panel went about its work a separate house task 
force on ethics began looking at the changing ethical landscape in 
washington and began examining whether it is time after 12 years to 
update house rules again 
at the task force hearing which opened wednesday chairman vic 
fazio dcalif sought to isolate the hearing from the current 
wright controversy one witness made the case against revision 
former rep otis pike dny who opposed the last rewrite of the 
rules in 1977 
you were not sent here to peek through the windows of each 
others private lives pike said you were sent here to pass 
laws and solve problems your preoccupation with each others 
ethics is preventing you from doing your jobs 
he added no one learns his ethics in congress no one needs 
to be told by his colleagues what is right and fair and honorable 
ethics is not as great a problem with congress as is courage

the high court has freed 15 men 
accused of massacring 11 white missionaries and five of their 
children saying they are absolved by a presidential amnesty 
newspapers reported today 
among those slain in november 1987 were american pentecostal 
missionaries david emerson 35 and his fiancee karen ivesdal 31 
who were from choteau mont and briton jean campbell 56 
state prosecutor thomas bvekerwa said on wednesday the 15 
seven dissident guerrillas and eight squatters are protected by 
an april 1988 amnesty declared by president robert mugabe the 
chronicle reported 
it said the men could have been hanged if they were convicted of 
murder the state had charged they hacked their victims to death 
with axes at two farms near southern bulawayo city on the night of 
november 25 1987 it was an act of revenge because police acting 
on the missionaries complaints had evicted the squatters 
prosecutors said 
the squatters had been trying to reclaim the land which they 
said belonged to their ancestors long before white settlers arrived 
a hundred years ago in this former british colony 
besides the two americans and the briton all the other victims 
were zimbabweans including a 6weekold baby girl 
the killers allegedly were led by morgan nkomo a dissident 
chieftain accused of other murders in the western province of 
matabeleland 
nkomo was among 115 guerrillas who a year ago laid down their 
arms and turned themselves in to police to accept an unconditional 
amnesty 
the amnesty protects zimbabwean army soldiers and guerrillas 
involved in atrocities in matabeleland where they fought 
sporadically for five years after mugabe fired opposition leader 
joshua nkomo from a coalition cabinet last year the two leaders 
reconciled and merged their parties

group by group they set out and so they returned 
to campuses 12 hours later 
but in between the many student groups coalesced to hold a 
disciplined crusade for democracy and lovefest with the masses 
broad smiles applause v for victory signs and donations of 
cash and drinks greeted the tens of thousands of students as they 
trudged under a searing sun thursday from campuses in northern and 
eastern beijing to central tiananmen square 
thank you people the students chanted back exhilarated by 
the welcome 
the march began small and subdued compared with one april 27 
which was livened by repeated police efforts to stop them 
early risers on haidian road where several schools are located 
asked each other have they come out yet and peered down the 
street for sign of student banners 
but when the first groups of students emerged from their walled 
campuses singing out of tune the reaction was disappointment 
there arent very many said one bystander wait a bit there 
are more coming was the students answer 
come they did from at least 55 schools by tens and by 
hundreds until at tiananmen they formed a mass 60000 strong 
along the way they picked up zest their chants grew firmer and 
their singing stronger they took as their march song the 
internationale a stirring call for world revolution that was 
blared from a loudspeaker carried on a threewheeled car 
taxis trucks loaded with cabbage and public buses steamed on 
the hot asphalt backed up in every direction as the protesters 
swarmed over main streets a taxi driver who stood by his idled 
vehicle said hed been stuck for an hour its no trouble its a 
legitimate demonstration he said calmly smoking 
passengers on one bus pasted a sheet of paper outside their 
window saying sympathetically the students try hard 
dozens of eager hands reached from cars and buses to snatch at 
faintly mimeographed pamphlets distributed by the marchers many 
people quickly tucked the sheets of paper into their pockets as if 
they were contraband 
the rights the people have won with their blood are turned 
over to the bureaucrats thundered one 
the students marched past shiny glassfronted computer stores on 
haidian road called beijings silicon valley past construction 
sites where workers in yellow hard hats waved their fists in the 
air in support past the capital theater showing aids victims 
a movie about the disease 
once in tiananmen they turned a giant portrait of sun yatsen 
leader of a 1911 revolution into a backdrop for a rally 
celebrating their goals of democratic reform 
we hope the people of china will support us a student 
leader shouted into a bullhorn what is there to fear 
students draped their banners over their heads for shade or 
fashioned pamphlets into paper hats two girls spread their 
advanced english texts over their heads 
three hundred students from the arts and crafts college stood 
out in the sea of white and red banners they all wore something 
yellow headbands wrist bands shirts neckerchiefs 
we think yellow is the color of democracy said one red 
is the color of repression 
by 4 pm the footsore and thirsty students had had enough 
return to your schools and continue to do propaganda work 
exhorted student leader wuer kaixi as he dismissed the crowd 
some left still weakly singing the internationale with 
parched throats 
bystanders lingered longer shuffling through shards of broken 
bottles and squashed plastic water containers while a breeze 
tossed paper across the vast square

dr c everett koop whose campaigns against 
smoking and aids marked an oftencontroversial seven years as 
surgeon general told president bush today he will leave office in 
july 
koop in a brief letter to the white house said he had told 
bush in february that he would not serve out his full second term 
which ends in november the surgeon general said he will leave july 
13 
koop 72 was appointed the governments top health officer by 
president reagan and was sworn into office in january 1982 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan applauded 
koops work saying he has been a voice of honesty integrity 
compassion and plain good sense 
there can be no doubt that during your term americas 
attitude toward tobacco use in particular has undergone fundamental 
change and of course in confronting the challenge of aids you 
have set an example of professionalism and caring for all 
americans sullivan said in a letter wishing koop well 
koop in his letter to bush said james mason assistant 
secretary for health will name an acting surgeon general after he 
leaves the surgeon general heads the public health services 
commissioned corps in hhs 
in a statement mason praised koop as an outstanding leader on 
major health issues 
all of us in the public health service and the medical 
profession are proud of what he has accomplished he has made 
impressive contributions to public health mason said 
koop was not available for comment his office said he was on 
his way to a meeting of the world health organization in geneva 
switzerland 
koop did not say in the letter what his plans are after he leave 
government he has said in interviews that he would like to write 
books and work in television on health issues 
public health service spokesman james brown said koop is 
working on several projects and further information will be 
released on that in the future 
under koops leadership the office of the surgeon general 
became an active and often controversial office 
koop maintained a vigilant campaign against smoking calling for 
a smokeless society by the year 2000 and worked actively on 
education campaigns aimed at helping to stop the spread of aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
when he was nominated by reagan for the post koop was an 
internationally known pediatric surgeon and was assailed by 
liberals for his staunch opposition to abortion and for lacking 
experience in public health 
social conservatives embraced him initially as time went on 
however they began to see him more as a traitor to their cause 
particularly after he issued a report on the aids crisis and 
increasingly took to the airwaves to promote condoms safe sex and 
sex education as preventive steps against the deadly disease 
liberals meanwhile warmed to him and have applauded his high 
profile on the aids issue 
urvashi vaid a spokeswoman for the national gay and lesbian 
task force said koop did an outstanding job on aids issues 
because he put aside his personal beliefs and approached it as a 
public health problem 
he stood up for what he believed was the right thing to do in 
terms of health policy even if it wasnt the right thing to do in 
terms of politics she said most victims of aids have been 
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of a house health 
subcommittee voiced deep misgivings when koop was named but today 
he said one of the great surprises of the last eight years is 
how wrong i was i take a great deal of pleasure in admitting how 
wrong i was if they could find a clone of koop they ought to 
appoint him as successor 
gary l bauer president of the conservative family research 
council who was an aide to president reagan said koop occasionally 
caused great chagrin among some at the white house with his 
comments including his call for explicit sex education at the 
earliest possible grade to stem the spread of aids 
the approach he advocated deeply offends the values of many 
parents bauer said 
despite his strong opposition to abortion koop recently found 
support from abortion rights groups when he declined to issue a 
report requested by the white house saying he could not find 
enough scientific evidence to determine whether abortion has 
harmful psychological effects on women 
koop is the nations 13th surgeon general a position that was 
created in 1870 as part of the merchant marine since the post has 
little statutory authority some presidents never filled the job 
while others gave the title to the assistant secretary of health in 
hhs 
the surgeon general advises the public on health matters such as 
smoking health diet and nutrition environmental hazards and the 
importance of immunizations and disease prevention 
the holder of the position also oversees the activities of the 
public health services 6000member commissioned corps 
koop said in his letter to bush he would take terminal leave 
beginning july 13 and would retire oct 1

the fired captain of the exxon valdez 
was ordered to stand trial next month on charges of being drunk 
while his vessel crashed into a reef and spilled more than 10 
million gallons of oil 
joseph hazelwood 42 pleaded innocent wednesday before state 
district court judge david stewart to three misdemeanor charges of 
operating a vessel while drunk reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil he faces two years three months in prison and 
11000 in fines if convicted of all the counts 
paulette foster a spokeswoman for the district attorneys 
office also said a grand jury has begun an investigation to 
determine whether additional criminal charges should also be filed 
against hazelwood who was released on 50000 bail hazelwoods 
attorneys said they will seek to have the trial scheduled for june 
20 in valdez moved because of extensive news coverage they have 
not yet proposed an alternate location 
hazelwood is accused of turning over control of the 
987footlong exxon valdez to an uncertified mate on march 24 when 
it rammed a charted reef outside shipping lanes and ripped its 
bottom letting the alaskan north slope oil pour into prince 
william sound 
authorities say hazelwood who has a history of alcoholrelated 
driving arrests in new york had a bloodalcohol level of 0061 
percent nine hours after the accident the legal maritime limit for 
operating a vessel is 004 percent 
after the spill hazelwood went home to huntington ny where 
he was arrested on a fugitive warrant he returned voluntarily 
wednesday and surrendered he had been free on 25000 bail in new 
york and a prosecutor said he would move to dismiss the fugitive 
charge and return the bail money 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile was scheduled to tour the 
spill damage tonight at cordova and the heavily tarred smith 
island he was to be accompanied by his wife marilyn gov steve 
cowper federal transportation secretary samuel skinner and coast 
guard adm paul a yost 
at smith island beach workers were constructing a wooden 
platform from which quayle could view the pollution 
the state responding to a request from yost to evaulate exxons 
revised cleanup plan rejected the exxon proposal saying it was 
inadequate and didnt provide for enough personnel to do the job 
according to state environmental conservation commissioner 
dennis kelso exxon is overly optimistic in projecting cleanup 
progress and does not address several needs including double 
cleaning of some heavily oiled areas and removal of oil from the 
water exxon also exaggerated the number of beaches it identified 
to be cleaned only by waves wind and rain said tom ferguson a 
state spokesman 
exxon corp president lee r raymond told reporters at a news 
conference in new york today that too much bureaucracy could hinder 
the cleanup effort in alaska 
raymond said as many as 14 government agencies may be involved 
in approving and carrying out the latest cleanup plan 
i want some one person in charge i dont care who it is 
because there has to be one person that finally says hey its 
midnight and we gotta do something he said 
exxon has recommended cleaning 364 miles of alaska coastline by 
midseptember but the company wants to leave untouched nearly 200 
of those miles and let them be cleaned by nature exxon also wants 
permission to bypass environmental laws to dispose of the oil 
wastes 
both provisions have been criticized by environmentalists 
the test should not be whether the oiling is heavy or light 
rather cleaning should be done whenever the benefits to the 
environment exceed the impacts from cleaning kelso said 
raymond said exxons plan was formulated with the help of 
environmentalists he also said that many parts of the plan were 
misinterpreted including reports that exxon is considering 
bypassing environmental laws with regard to the disposal of waste 
materials 
on wednesday state authorities reported increasing damage on 
the alaska peninsula and at katmai national park 
its a very thick moussetype stuff 6 to 8 inches thick 
hitting in blotches said bill lamoreaux a state environmental 
official its definitely a difficult type of cleanup operation 
its close to shore and rolling up on shore

nations organization that admits the palestine liberation 
organization as a member state won 100 approval today from a panel 
of the house foreign affairs committee 
the move came as a warning in advance of a decision next week by 
the world health organization a un agency on the plos 
application for full membership 
the subcommittee on human rights and international organizations 
acted after members declared that the plo does not meet the 
qualifications of a state under international law 
it is not a government and does not meet the qualifications of 
a state said chairman gus yatron dpa 
rep tom lantos dcalif said that if the who does vote to 
admit the plo he will introduce legislation demanding that the 
united states suspend its recently opened dialogue with the plo 
which has been accused of fomenting terrorism against israel 
the resolution endorsed by the subcommittee would forbid us 
contributions to the united nations or any of its affiliated 
organizations which grant full membership as a state to any 
organization or group that does not have the internationally 
recognized attributes of statehood 
it was not clear whether the full house would be able to act on 
the legislation before the who votes on the issue 
the plo currently has observer status at the united nations and 
in its organizations but is not a full voting member

californias allure is plummeting in the 
eyes of its residents according to poll results released thursday 
that showed the golden states image at its lowest point since a 
survey began in 1967 
the bloom is off the rose said mervin field director of 
the california poll 
the proportion of residents polled who describe the state as 
one of the best places to live dropped 20 percentage points in 
the past four years from 78 percent to 58 percent twentyseven 
percent rank it as only nice but not outstanding 
eleven percent describe california as about an average place 
to live while 3 percent say it is a rather poor place one 
percent had no opinion 
its the first time since field began asking this question in 
1967 that the top rating has fallen below 70 percent 
the poll was based on telephone interviews with 496 california 
adults statewide over a 10day period ended april 22 field 
reported a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 45 percentage 
points 
in the san francisco bay area 76 percent rate the state highly 
but that figure is still a decline of 7 percentage points from 1985 
only 49 percent in los angeles and orange counties describe the 
state as the best a 24point drop from a 1985 high of 73 percent 
field said that in the past the people surveyed cited climate 
and living conditions as reasons for rating california highly 
but with the increasing travails of housing transportation 
crime social problems and decline in political action by elected 
leaders it all adds up to this growing disenchantment he said

don johnson is back on the hook for a 
vermont income tax bill of more than 50000 at least for now 
the state senates finance committee on wednesday killed a 
provision of a new tax law that would exempt entertainers from 
state income tax retroactive to jan 1 1986 and applying to 
johnson 
the committee approved the exemption tuesday but 24 hours and 
dozens of telephone calls from angry constituents later the panel 
reversed itself 
we realized we had been rather hasty in this matter 
committee chairwoman mary just skinner told her colleagues 
wednesday 
the state had billed johnson for money he earned in vermont 
while making the 1987 film sweethearts dance the movie and 
television actor is best known for his starring role on 
televisions miami vice 
in a lengthy statement issued today by his press agent johnson 
said he regretted that the issue had been personalized to focus 
on him rather than the policy implications of the tax 
the greater and far more important issue has far more to 
do with the millions and millions of dollars in revenue that the 
state of vermont ie the people stand to lose as a result of 
this decision the statement said 
johnson called vermont a place of scenic wonder and said 
that having this exquisite environment filmed and displayed in a 
major motion picture was a picture postcard invitation to the 
film audience to visit vermont 
tax officials had asked for quick action on the exemption 
saying johnson had appealed his tax bill and threatened to spread 
the word in hollywood that vermont was a bad place to make movies 
if he were forced to pay it 
backers of the exemption including gov madeleine kunin said 
it would make moviemakers more welcome in vermont 
vermonts income tax is figured as 25 percent of a persons 
federal tax liability

legions of students marched through beijing on 
thursday and occupied tiananmen square to mark the 70th anniversary 
of chinas first student movement with another stunning display of 
their craving for democracy 
about 100000 people more than half of them students defied 
police and peacefully gathered in the huge square for a festive 
rally to seek greater freedom cleaner government a free press and 
official recognition of the new independent student union that 
authorities say is illegal 
students held much smaller demonstrations in shanghai nanjing 
and changsha and about 300 journalists from the official chinese 
media joined the student rally in tiananmen throughout beijing 
crowds of workers applauded the students and shouted encouragement 
perhaps the march will not bring democracy today tomorrow or 
the day after tomorrow but if we keep working on it china has 
hope said one worker who claimed he risked being fired by 
attending the demonstration 
we have to transform china echoed an excited 20yearold 
sophmore from the political science and law college one of at 
least 55 schools that participated in the rally which capped a 
remarkable three weeks of prodemocracy student demonstrations in 
beijing 
after initially saying the student marches were designed to 
undermine chinas government the communist leadership in recent 
days has said that the demonstrators are being manipulated by 
unspecified people and that most protesting students are patriotic 
student activists appeared ready thursday to shift their 
tactics after six successful marches in defiance of the 
government they indicated future activity may not center on 
demonstrations they also announced that a nearly 2weekold 
boycott that shut down most beijing university classes would end 
friday 
wuer kaixi a leading activist said setting up independent 
newspapers would be among the new steps 
the students chanting slogans such as down with official 
profiteering and patriotism is no crime poured into 
tiananmen in the early afternoon after marching all morning from 
their universities on the outskirts of beijing 
at a few intersections marchers had to shove their way through 
hundreds of unarmed police lined six deep across the road but the 
government clearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation the 
security presence was smaller than a week earlier when about 
150000 students and supporters marched on tiananmen 
although authorities had ordered the square closed thursday the 
police who surrounded tiananmen offered no resistance and quickly 
left when the students arrived 
red banners bearing slogans and school names soon fluttered 
above the square as students sat or milled about some listening to 
activists speak and others seeking shade soft drinks and garden 
hoses for relief from the hot sun throughout the afternoon 
students ferried countless boxes of popsicles to the sweaty crowd 
the rally ended about 4 pm when the students began the 
exhausting walk back to their schools up to 10 miles away 
we havent achieved our goals yet acknowledged one beijing 
university student i think this movement already is significant 
but we cant say thats it 
students returned to their schools by a different route than the 
one taken the week before disappointing workers who crowded 
overpasses along the previous path to cheer the protesters 
support from the thousands of onlookers was obvious from the 
beginning of the day when they jeered police who attempted to 
block the students and warned youre not allowed to hit people 
marchers gathered contributions from the crowds and distributed 
pamphlets explaining their movement some students went into the 
subway throwing packets of pamphlets in each car workers 
peasants soldiers unite sang other demonstrators as they 
walked toward tiananmen 
one worker captivated marchers from beijing normal university 
when he grabbed a bullhorn and gave an emotional speech of support 
as he rode on the back of a pedicab we should stand up for the 
next generation he bellowed in a voice raw from screaming 
and as the students rushed into the square an opera actor with 
stained teeth proclaimed this is a big day i want to be here 
he brought a camera to record the massive protest as did thousands 
of others 
but a strong police presence in shanghai prevented workers from 
joining a demonstration by about 7000 students according to jason 
hurtado an american witness 
in nanjing about 1000 students from three schools marched to 
the headquarters of the provincial government an american witness 
reported 
the demonstrations marked the may fourth movement of 1919 which 
was chinas first student movement starting in opposition to 
concessions granted to the japanese government during world war i 
it developed into a movement calling for mr democracy and mr 
science to save china 
officially sponsored celebrations to mark the 1919 movement were 
held throughout china ironically hours before the university 
students invaded tiananmen 10000 youths gathered in the square to 
take the oath admitting them to the communist youth league

thousands of riot police blocked an 
antigovernment rally thursday the day after six of their comrades 
were killed and the president threatened to use emergency powers 
against violent protest 
about 8000 riot officers moved into the downtown area of this 
strikebound port arresting 433 workers and students to thwart a 
rally called by labor groups to denounce president roh taewoos 
government 
police armed with shields and clubs guarded factories and 
patrolled streets dispersing onlookers and keeping the area clear 
officials said 800 people trying to reach the rally at masan 185 
miles southeast of seoul were turned back at roadblocks 
about 50 students held a brief protest in the heart of masan 
chanting slogans but fled when riot squads arrived an estimated 
4000 workers who could not get to the rally site conducted 
peaceful demonstrations at their plants 
how can we march for our rights when there are so many 
police one dissident leader said on condition of anonymity 
in seoul a 24yearold union leader at a garment factory doused 
himself with kerosene and set himself afire to protest poor working 
conditions news reports said he was in critical condition and a 
fellow worker whose clothing accidently caught fire also was 
hospitalized the reports said 
many riot officers in masan wore black mourning ribbons for the 
comrades killed wednesday in nearby pusan south koreas 
secondlargest city when police raided a college trying to rescue 
five police officers being held hostage 
the officers were climbing a barricade when radical students set 
it afire police said the hostages were freed later 
roh said wednesday he would use emergency powers if necessary to 
halt weeks of violent protest by radical students and militant 
workers trying to bring down his government 
south koreas constitution allows the president to rule by 
decree or impose martial law in an emergency 
confrontations between protesters and riot police are common in 
south korea but rarely are people killed officers carry shields 
wear helmets and fireproof clothing and normally are armed only 
with tear gas and clubs 
opposition leaders as well as government officials appealed for 
an end to the violence after the deaths wednesday it was the 
greatest loss of life in political violence since 1980 when at 
least 192 people were killed in an ant9government uprising 
police said thursday they would charge five student leaders with 
murder and arson for which the maximum penalty is death police 
also seek charges against 50 others 
legislators of the government and opposition parties agreed to 
enact laws against firebombs 
the education ministry was given authority to request police 
intervention against campus unrest previously the decision was 
left to individual schools 
in seoul a total of about 1000 radical students shouting 
down with the roh regime marched on at least three campuses 
but avoided clashes with police 
we will go ahead with our antiroh campaign but this time we 
think we have to restrain ourselves a student leader said 
radical students are a vocal minority on campuses but have 
little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
views the government is concerned about their efforts to make 
alliances with militant workers against the government 
roh has introduced democratic reforms but the radicals contend 
the former general is a front for the military 
farmers and radical students shouting antiamerican slogans 
demonstrated in chonan and taejon on thursday against imports of 
us farm products and the stationing of american troops in south 
korea according to news reports 
students have attacked us government and military facilities 
as part of a campaign for immediate withdrawal of the 43000 
american troops in south korea 
they contend the presence of american troops blocks unification 
with communist north korea the peninsula has been divided since 
1945 and the two koreas fought a war in 195053

cheated investors out of millions of dollars through illegal 
trading practices 
no indictments have been announced but as many as 200 subpoenas 
reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the exchanges 
cftc spokeswoman kate hathaway in washington would neither 
confirm nor deny there was an ongoing investigation of the new york 
exchanges she said the agency like the sec cannot bring criminal 
charges 
in the past the cftc usually has utilized fbi agents or postal 
inspectors in its investigations 
joseph valiquette a spokesman for the fbi in new york denied 
that fbi agents were involved in the incident 
assistant us attorney anne c ryan also declined comment on 
whether an investigation was under way or whether her office the 
securities and commodities frauds section was involved 
three separate commodities traders said a merc trader was 
escorted from the floor of the exchange and questioned by federal 
agents other sources said three silver traders from a new york 
commodities brokerage house were taken from the comex floor 
other traders said floor activity was unaffected by the probe 
at midday gold silver and platinum prices were down while crude 
oil prices were mixed 
i think things are getting blown all out of proportion said 
one new york trader who asked not to be named one trader who 
supposedly was taken out and put in a paddy wagon is trading in the 
ring

the bush administration reversing previous 
us policy said thursday it would support legislation providing 
for sanctions against countries and companies that sell or use 
chemical weapons provided the president is given discretion to 
implement such measures 
the decision announced by assistant secretary of state allen 
holmes to the house foreign affairs committee was viewed as a 
desire to influence a handful of sanctions bills that appear to 
stand a good chance of approval 
it also reflected the conciliatory tone adopted by the new 
administration toward congress on foreign policy issues such as the 
agreement reached between the white house and congress last month 
for aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
we welcome the opportunity to work with congress to 
strengthen our tools for combatting cw chemical weapons 
proliferation holmes said in doing so we accept in principle 
that some form of sanctions if appropriately formulated would 
give the administration an additional instrument against countries 
that use cw and companies that aid proliferation 
the president already has open to him sanctions he can invoke 
against countries that produce and use chemical weapons he has 
imposed such sanctions against libya syria iraq and iran in 
recent years 
but in light of revelations that iraq used nerve gas and other 
chemical weapons against its kurdish minority and against iran 
during the nineyear gulf war congress wants to legislate 
mandatory sanctions 
the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee sen 
claiborne pell dri and the ranking republican on the panel 
jesse helms of north carolina introduced two sanctions bills 
following revelations last year that west german firms had helped 
libya build a chemical weapons plant near the town of rabta 
both bills will probably be voted on next month there are also 
several other similar measures in the senate and house all of 
which would impose automatic penalties on countries and companies 
theres a lot of sentiment in congress to take the whole thing 
out of the presidents hands and just mandate it said rep dante 
fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
nonetheless he praised signs of hope and change both in congress 
and in the executive branch and said my hope is that we will 
be able to join together in adopting a comprehensive policy 
holmes argued that mandatory automatic sanctions would tie the 
presidents hands he has got to be able to tailor our responses 
to individual circumstances and individual countries holmes said 
mandatory sanctions would also hamper us attempts to rally 
other countries around a global chemical weapons ban being 
negotiated in geneva and around various exportcontrol measures 
being debated by the socalled australia group 
the group which is comprised of the 12nation european economic 
community the united states japan canada norway and 
switzerland is meeting in paris next week

the defense department in an assessment of 
damage on the battleship iowa said thursday that the navy believes 
the damaged gun turret can be repaired for 15 million to 20 
million 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said no decision had 
yet been made to proceed with repairs but that the dollar estimate 
was sufficiently low that cost was unlikely to be a factor in 
resolving the iowas future 
a more important question howard said is likely to be whether 
the ship should be withdrawn from duty immediately for repairs or 
allowed to proceed with routine deployments until its next 
regularly scheduled overhaul 
howard disclosed earlier this week that a 35member team of navy 
specialists had determined the materials and expertise were still 
available to make repairs 
the answer to that basic question had not been clear in the 
immediate aftermath of the april 19 tragedy because of the vessels 
age the iowa was commissioned in 1943 during world war ii and no 
vessel of its type has been built since that war 
fortyseven sailors died in the explosion inside the no 2 gun 
turret while loading a 16inch gun with powder

the state department is sending seven us 
diplomats to nicaragua to replace all but one of the american 
envoys who were expelled by the sandinista government 10 months 
ago a spokeswoman said thursday 
nicaragua in turn will be allowed to replace seven of the 
diplomats the reagan administration had expelled in retaliation for 
the ouster of the americans 
the upgrading of the respective embassy staffs does not reflect 
an improvement in relations between the two countries but rather a 
desire of both to be better represented in each others capital 
according to us officials 
last july the sandinista government ordered us ambassador 
richard melton and seven other envoys out of nicaragua on charges 
they were fomenting unrest 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said all seven slots 
below the ambassador level will be filled in addition four others 
in managua who are being reassigned will be replaced bringing to 
11 the number of new american diplomats being sent there 
us officials said the embassy in managua has been operating 
under considerable strain because the number of diplomats there has 
been too small for the work load the area most affected has been 
reporting on political and economic affairs according to the 
officials who asked not to be identified 
among those expelled by the reagan administration was ambassador 
carlos tunnermann who was accredited both to the united states and 
the organization of american states 
nicaragua objected to vigorously to tunnermanns expulsion 
contending it was a violation of standard procedure to expel a 
diplomat assigned to an international organization 
the bush administrations policy toward nicaragua has been to 
promote a democratic evolution there through political economic 
and diplomatic pressures this represented a marked change from the 
approach of president reagan who felt military pressure by the 
contra rebels was the only way to achieve that objective 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said that the united 
states is prepared to make conciliatory gestures toward the 
sandinistas if they promote genuine democratic reform between now 
and next february when national elections are scheduled 
otherwise he has said the administration will increase economic 
pressures and take other steps against the sandinistas

the bush administration on thursday opposed 
legislation calling for a 10year program to study the warming of 
the worlds climate and to require that federal agencies consider 
the effect of their actions on the global environment 
the house bill calls for coordinating research with other 
countries and international organizations including the world 
meteorological organization and the un environmental program 
we oppose the enactment of the bill as unnecessary because it 
duplicates existing government function and authority said 
wiiliam e evans undersecretary for oceans and atmosphere in the 
commerce department 
he objected to asking federal agencies to take the global 
environment into consideration on the ground that the government 
already has the power to do that 
the administration is currently reviewing this issue he 
said 
dalas l peck director of the us geological survey singled 
out the bills provision for a council on global environmental 
policy as unnecessary because the federal government already has 
the council on environmental quality he also opposed giving 
congress a say in setting the way the administration handles its 
budget 
both evans and peck endorsed the purpose of the bill which 
seeks to advance scientific understanding of global climate changes 
and to provide a basis for the governments policy decisions 
it was introduced by rep walter b jones dnc chairman of 
the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries wednesdays 
hearing was held by its subcommittee on oceanography and the great 
lakes 
the bill was endorsed by stephen h schneider of the national 
center for atmospheric research in boulder colo which is 
sponsored by the national science foundation 
such a measure to coordinate federal activities in global 
change research and the policy implications of global change is 
long overdue he said

journalists from chinas tightly controlled 
official media joined students thursday in an unprecedented 
demonstration for freedom of the press 
chinas most outspoken newspaper the world economic herald in 
its latest issue called for freedom of speech and the development 
of independent newspapers despite the fact that its editor was 
fired last week for refusing to obey government orders 
about 300 journalists students and onlookers gathered outside 
the rustic gates of the staterun xinhua news agency 
chinese reporters participating in the march said journalists 
from more than 30 major newspapers and magazines all 
statecontrolled had joined the protest 
after hoisting banners reading dont make us tell lies and 
citizens china is yours they moved down the street 
surprising residents who had not expected to see marchers coming 
from their own neighborhood far to the south of beijings 
university district 
xinhua authorities warned employees against joining the protest 
said two reporters we had to sneak out many people were unable 
to come one said 
on wednesday dozens of journalists of the official media 
launched a petition drive to demand the reinstatement of qin benli 
former editor of the shanghaibased world economic herald who was 
fired last week for refusing to alter articles officials said were 
likely to cause disturbances 
the respected weekly which implicitly protested qins firing 
also called for an independent free press 
political democratization is closely linked to press 
democratization it said we need an environment for free 
truthful speech 
reporters many belonging to the communist party have demanded 
a dialogue with government officials on broader issues of 
censorship reflecting growing dissatisfaction with a system in 
which much of their work is never released 
their protests have been prompted in part by tight government 
limits on reporting of student demonstrations over the past few 
weeks dozens of chinese journalists have covered the protests but 
only a few newspapers have reported the scale and popularity of the 
marches 
most of us young reporters at the peoples daily want to speak 
the truth but our paper is the most tightly controlled said one 
journalist since the students have shouted so much for a free 
press we should speak out too he said 
when the journalists and student marchers converged on beijings 
main thoroughfare changan boulevard there was an explosion of 
applause hand shaking and cheers 
i think the journalists joining us will give our movement 
more strength said one student

the city attorney has asked the federal 
securities and exchange commission to look into mayor tom bradleys 
stock trades in companies that later were swept up in a major 
insidertrading scandal 
city attorney james hahn forwarded information on the trades to 
the securities and exchange commission hahns spokesman mike 
qualls said today 
we did it on our own initiative the spokesman said 
questions had arisen and we felt they were the ones with 
expertise to look into it 
the mayor has ties to indicted junkbond guru michael milken 
who was fired as the top bond trader for drexel burnham lambert 
inc after being charged with racketeering and fraud in the 
insidertrading probe 
hahns statements came after he testified before a city council 
government operations committee hearing in which city lawmakers 
took up the issue of whether bradley violated city conflict of 
interest ordinances 
city treasurer leonard rittenberg told the committee he takes 
responsibility for a 600000 deposit in federal grant money that 
sat idle in a bank that bank later paid bradley to serve as an 
adviser 
very frankly we screwed up rittenberg said explaining the 
citys handling of funds from the federal urban mass transportation 
administration he said he was not pressured by bradley to make the 
deposit 
far east national bank at one point held more than 13 million 
in city money deposits and paid bradley 18000 last year as a 
consultant the mayor has since returned the salary 
in addition to far east national bank the city attorney also is 
investigating the mayors 24000ayear salary as a member of the 
board of directors of valley federal savings and loan association 
which has been involved in city business 
though hahn wouldnt detail the sec connection it appears to 
center on the mayors 1985 and 1986 purchases of stock in two 
companies beatrice foods inc and the wickes cos inc that now 
are part of the investigation of drexel and milken 
the federal indictment of milken alleges he manipulated the 
price of wickes stock congressional investigators have said they 
found drexel employees bought significant amounts of the junk bonds 
used to finance a leveraged buyout of beatrice 
hahn said he gave the sec copies of the mayors financial 
disclosure statements on public file with the city clerk which 
describe both transactions 
drexel spokesman steven anreder refused to comment on the matter 
and wouldnt say if bradley ever had an account at the brokerage 
bradley has close ties to milken a major contributor to the 
mayors political campaigns bradley helped organize an effort to 
lobby congress to persuade the sec to allow drexels junk bond 
division to remain in beverly hills after a federal investigation

government officials said thursday the 
decision about whether to have nuclear missiles on its territory 
ultimately rests with west germany not its nato partners 
the west germans insist over strong objections by the united 
states and britains that eastwest negotiations be held on 
reducing the number of shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
also at issue is whether to modernize the alliances 88 
battlefieldrange lance missiles most of which are stationed in 
this country and would be used here in case of war west germany 
wants nato to postpone a decision on modernization 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said in an interview 
wednesday night we have the first and last word about the 
stationing of rockets on our territory and no one else 
on thursday a government official said genscher meant decisions 
on nuclear missiles based in west germany should be made by 
consultation within the north atlantic treaty organization but 
bonn has the final say 
we have to give our consent the official said speaking 
privately 
he noted genschers previous comment that west germanys views 
on missiles based within its boundaries must be given special 
weight 
alfred dregger parliamentary chairman of chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democratic union party was quoted as saying some 
nato countries refuse to understand why west germany wants 
increased efforts for disarmament 
those nations are not ready to acknowledge the strategic 
situation of the only divided country in europe through which the 
militarized border between east and west runs he said according 
to the newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung 
it also quoted dregger as saying natos foundations of trust 
could be damaged if the alliance does not show enough consideration 
for the interests of individual members 
nato nations are trying to heal the rift before the alliance 
summit may 2930 in brussels west germany claims nearly half the 
16 members are on its side 
genscher and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg sent a letter 
wednesday to secretary of state james a baker iii a west german 
official said privately he called it part of the decisionmaking 
process but said he did not know the contents 
canada has proposed a compromise that calls for negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear weapons with the understanding that some 
modernized lances would remain and the warsaw pacts edge in 
conventional forces would be ended 
president bush said wednesday that starting negotiations on 
shortrange weapons now would be a mistake 
baker and his 15 nato counterparts are to meet in brussels on

president bush today heatedly denied that he 
ever told the president of honduras there would be expedited 
american aid in exchange for that countrys aid to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
standing on the white house south lawn with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney bush for the first time publicly addressed 
headon the question of whether as vice president he participated 
in a purported reagan administration plan to make quid quo pro 
deals with latin american countries to get help for the contras 
the president had refused to answer the question directly in 
recent weeks as the irancontra trial of fired reagan 
administration white house aide oliver north was under way 
but bush noted that the north trial jury was about to deliver 
its verdict and he responded emphatically when reporters asked 
whether he had assured honduran president roberto suazo in march 
1985 that the administration would reward his country for continued 
help to the contras 
there was no quid pro quo bush asserted everybody that 
attended the meeting says that there was no quid pro quo and for 
those who says there was the onus is on them 
less than an hour after bush spoke the jury convicted north on 
three of 12 criminal counts 
bush declined to answer specifically when asked whether he had 
discussed contra aid with suazo during the meeting asked whether 
he had known of any quid pro quo arrangements between the us 
government and honduras he replied not to my knowledge 
the president complained that there has been much needless 
mindless speculation about my word of honor and ive answered it 
now definitively 
new questions arose about bushs role in the irancontra affair 
last month when the government consented to the release of a 
42page finding of facts in connection with the sales of arms to 
iran and the diversion of proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
these documents contained memos and other documents suggesting 
that bush had acted as an intermediary in ensuring the honduran 
leaders that their assistance to the contras would be rewarded by 
expedited us economic and military aid 
bush maintained today that records of his meeting in honduras 
with suazo demonstrate that there was no quid pro quo no 
implication no quid quo pro direct or indirect from me to the 
president of honduras at that meeting 
he said that in the aftermath of the north trial i will 
insist that the congressional committees now that the jury is 
in be briefed thoroughly on the confidential cables describing 
the meeting 
the president said there have been allegations that he went to 
honduras and discussed a quid pro quo arrangement with suazo 
he said that i can now state declaratively without any fear 
of contradiction that there wasnt a quid pro quo and thats 
all i am going to say 
bush did not say whether he had personally reviewed the cables 
that he alluded to in his statements to reporters press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said recently that bush had told aides privately 
that he was not part of any quid pro quo arrangements with the 
hondurans

president bush said today he is willing to 
negotiate over a dispute in nato over shortrange nuclear weapons 
but that he would not accept total elimination of the weapons or 
permit the soviet union to maintain its superiority 
bush commented in a joint news conference with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney after the two leaders discussed the issue 
during a white house meeting 
west germany has called for negotiations to reduce the 
nucleartipped missiles and artillery shells but bush has rejected 
the idea the dispute threatens to disrupt the harmony of a north 
atlantic treaty organization summit in brussels on may 2930 
i want the nato summit to be a success and we will be working 
with the germans and with others to see that there is a common nato 
position the president said this is no time for one to 
compromise or somebody not to compromise 
bush said the united states had made some proposals to bonn and 
i expect well be hearing from them soon 
im always willing to negotiate but were not going to go for 
any third zero elimination of the weapons or getting snf another 
term for the weapons out of whack in terms of negotiations so 
lets be clear on that he said 
mulroney said that although nato must debate the issue in the 
end there must be solidarity total solidarity 
mulroney was in washington to dedicate his countrys new 76 
million embassy the first ever built on pennsylvania avenue it is 
a modernistic sixstory building of ontario limestone and 
unpolished aluminum 
the embassy was occupied in march a year behind schedule at a 
cost of 76 million nearly double the original estimate but its 
troubles were forgotten wednesday evening as mulroney and secretary 
of state james a baker iii paid tribute to the enduring friendship 
between their two countries 
the maple leaf comes to pennsylvania avenue mulroney 
declared 
baker said the new embassy conveys the warmth and openness of 
the people of canada and promised to give uscanadian ties 
the personal attention this friendship deserves 
with a smiling baker at his elbow mulroney then took a pair of 
scissors and snipped a royal blue ribbon draped across the main 
entrance to the chancery building together they went up to 
ambassador derek burneys penthouse office suite to admire the view 
below 
their audience of several hundred dignitaries included 
congressional leaders supreme court justice harry a blackmun cia 
director william webster and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan 
they feasted on shrimp beef and salmon canapes and iced bottles 
of canadian ale while kilted bagpipers and a military band from 
ottawa performed on the courtyard outside 
the dramatic building designed by vancouver architect arthur 
erickson is the only foreign embassy situated on pennsylvania 
avenue the ceremonial route linking the capitol and the white 
house 
standing on a 12acre plot opposite the national gallery of art 
and close to capitol hill the embassy site was chosen to symbolize 
the close historic ties between the united states and canada 
the land formerly was the site of boarding houses a library a 
ford automobile factory and most recently a city shelter for 
homeless women former white house chief of staff howard baker once 
called it the finest piece of real estate in north america 
the embassys 327member staff moved into the building a month 
ago from its previous quarters in two buildings on massachusetts 
avenue the citys traditional embassy row and rented space in 
a downtown office building 
burney who arrived shortly before bush was inaugurated on jan 
20 will continue to reside in an elegant sixstory mansion on 
massachusetts avenue where canadian envoys had maintained their 
offices since 1928 
the stone courtyard outside the main entrance features a 
statuary pool terraced greenery along office balconies and a 
fountain surrounding a rotunda resting on 12 columns representing 
canadas 10 provinces and two territories 
inside the 287000squarefoot building whose ground floor is 
shielded by bulletresistant glass windows are a 20000volume 
library a 175seat theater a small exercise room an art gallery 
an underground garage and a safe room to guard secret 
discussions against electronic eavesdropping 
the start of construction originally scheduled for 1985 was 
delayed for a year because of spending cuts ordered by mulroneys 
government after he took office in 1984 
earlier the government of prime minister pierre trudeau came 
under fire when it selected erickson an old trudeau friend as 
embassy architect after an independent advisory commission had 
rejected erickson in favor of four other architects

in a huge victory for consumers the state 
supreme court today unanimously upheld virtually every major 
provision of the proposition 103 insurance initiative 
however the court modified the measures most important 
immediate effect a 20 percent rollback and oneyear freeze on auto 
and property insurance rates it said it would allow exemptions for 
insurers who could prove their rates were inadequate to earn a 
fair return 
but the justices rejected every other challenge to the measure 
by insurers who claimed it violated their constitutional property 
rights insurers have said the measure will cost them 4 billion a 
year and will drive many insurance companies out of california 
the ruling requires auto property and liability insurance rates 
to be reduced 20 percent below november 1987 levels but until this 
november insurers will be allowed to increase those rates 
through november the court said any increase above the 
rollback level must be refunded with interest if the state 
insurance commissioner later decides that the increase was 
excessive after november state approval will be required in 
advance for rate increases 
other provisions upheld include restrictions on geographical 
ratesetting for auto insurance a mandatory 20 percent discount 
for good drivers and a veto power for the state over future 
rate increases all those provisions take effect this november 
it was a stunning decision by the conservativedominated court 
in the face of widespread predictions that substantial portions of 
proposition 103 would be overturned 
they did something nobody expected said james wheaton a 
lawyer for proposition 103 author harvey rosenfield for the 
first time in california history consumers are going to have 
protection from insurance company greed 
this is an insidethepark home run for consumers but 
obviously the ballgame isnt over yet said attorney general john 
van de kamp who opposed proposition 103 on the ballot but helped 
to defend it in court 
insurers could ask the us supreme court to review their claims 
that restrictions on rates and nonrenewals of policies violate 
property rights under the us constitution 
in the one portion of the ruling that was a victory for the 
insurance companies justice allen broussard wrote that the 
propositions standard for exemptions from the oneyear rate freeze 
was unconstitutional 
but in a crucial portion of the ruling he said the invalidity 
of the shortterm standard for rate increases did not require 
throwing out the entire initiative 
the voters who enacted proposition 103 would presumably prefer 
ratesetting and regulation under the balance of the initiative to 
the method of setting insurance rates which existed before the 
initiative was enacted broussard said 
after this november proposition 103 requires an insurer to 
submit any rate increase in advance to the state insurance 
commissioner who will decide if it is excessive inadequate or 
unfairly discriminatory the court left that provision intact 
the court ruled one other provision of the measure invalid it 
would have required creation of a private nonprofit corporation to 
represent the interests of insurance customers the justices said 
it violated a state constitutional provision forbidding the naming 
of a private corporation to perform any function

of hundreds killed in a 1978 south african army strike on a black 
nationalist camp thursday urged the united nations to replace its 
envoy in namibia 
at un headquarters in new york secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar said south african forces in namibia should be confined 
to their barracks as soon as possible and called on pretoria to 
restrain police there 
supporters of the guerrilla southwest africa peoples 
organization rallied at katatura the black township outside the 
territorial capital of windhoek and called for the immediate 
replacement of un special representative martti ahtisaari 
they accused ahtisaari a finn of incompetence for agreeing to 
release south african troops to fight an april guerrilla incursion 
from angola that nearly derailed un plans to hold independence 
elections in november 
two irish un monitors were the only policemen visible at the 
rally of 1000 
state radio reported visible tension when 5000 people 
rallied in northern ongwediva the town is near the fortified 
military base of oshakati in northern namibia where more than 300 
men mostly guerrillas have been killed in a months fighting 
in windhoek 40 youths picketed the un police post carrying 
signs demanding the united nations immediately take over 
administration of the territory south africa has ruled for 74 years

was agreed south african forces would return to barracks by may 13 
but perez de cuellar wants that timetable shortened giuiliani said

atlantis outwaited fickle weather 
and streaked into orbit today carrying five astronauts who will 
dispatch the magellan probe to cloudshrouded venus for the best 
look yet at earths nearest neighbor 
the winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the florida sky 
at 247 pm edt after being delayed a nailbiting 59 minutes by 
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second 
postponement in six days nasa had 64 minutes in which to launch 
today and used all but five minutes of that time 
it was another cliffhanger said acting nasa administrator 
dale meyers 
the launch starts a 15month journey of 806 million miles for 
the robot explorer craft magellan the first american deep space 
probe in 11 years the 550 million craft which had to be launched 
by may 28 or wait two years is carrying to venus a powerful radar 
system that will map most of the planet magellan is named for the 
16thcentury portuguese explorer 
atlantis riding a 700foot cascade of flame rose majestically 
from its beachside launch pad into a blue nearly cloudless sky 
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view 
two solidfueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2 
minutes six seconds precisely on schedule and were jettisoned 
atlantis flew on powered by its liquidfueled rockets 
the successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers 
earlier in the day by late in the launch window sea breezes had 
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at 
the kennedy space center emergency landing site 
nasas first attempt to launch atlantis last friday was halted 
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel 
pump later engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a 
hydrogen fuel line both parts were replaced 
the crew members for the mission the 29th shuttle flight and 
the fourth since the challenger disaster are commander david m 
walker pilot ronald grabe and mission specialists norman thagard 
mary cleave and mark lee 
six hours after launch cleave and lee operate remote controls 
to eject magellan from the shuttles cargo bay a powerful rocket 
will then send magellan out of earth orbit and start it on a voyage 
that will carry it 1 times around the sun before reaching venus 
atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above earth 
while the crew operates scientific experiments landing is set for 
monday at edwards air force base calif 
todays launch opportunity was determined by the path magellan 
must follow to reach earths mysterious neighbor if the launch had 
been postponed there would have been daily launch opportunities 
until may 28 at that point earth and venus would have moved out 
of alignment and the magellan mission would not be possible for two 
years 
magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a us planetary 
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978 
venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky 
it is the brightest object in the nighttime sky except for the 
moon it appears in season as either the morning or the evening 
star but venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million 
miles from the sun the earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun 
scientists are intrigued by venus because it is so close in size 
to earth yet much different in most every other way venus rotates 
the opposite direction of the earth which means the sun rises in 
the west its rotation is so slow that a venusian day lasts 243 
earth days 
venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be 
seen by telescopes on earth giving the planet an aura of mystery 
space probes in recent years have proven that venus surface 
temperature is about 900 degrees hot enough to melt lead the 
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures with 
highaltitude clouds of sulfuric acid 
the torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the 
planet but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges towering 
volcanoes and barren plains 
magellan will rendezvous with venus in august 1990 it will 
settle into an elongated orbit sooping to within 155 miles of the 
surface and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5000 
miles 
the 3ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give 
the clearest picture yet of venus the radar is able to penetrate 
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football 
field 
magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of venus the radar 
will operate during 2000 passes over the planet each time viewing 
a slice of surface and sending the image back to earth for computer 
enhancement the mapping expedition is expected to last about eight 
months 
magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks 
what lennard fisk the national aeronautics and space 
administrations chief scientist called a resurgence of 
americas planetary program 
pioneervenus in 1978 was the last us space launch and fisk 
said america had a planetary program that was in danger of being 
an alsoran 
voyager 2 launched in 1977 will fly past neptune in august it 
earlier visted jupiter saturn and uranus in october the robot 
craft galileo will be launched toward jupiter a space telescope 
will be launched next year followed by probes to the sun in 1990 
and to mars in 1992 
nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary 
exploration again said fisk

now that oliver norths irancontra trial is 
over independent counsel lawrence e walsh can focus on trying the 
next major case against norths former boss john m poindexter 
poindexter who was national security adviser to president 
reagan not only is charged with obstructing congressional 
inquiries into the irancontra affair he also faces the central 
conspiracy counts that were dropped against north when the bush 
administration refused to disclose secret documents needed by the 
defense 
because poindexter unlike north had daily contact with reagan 
his trial could shed new light on how closely the former president 
might have been involved in the secret plans to sell arms to iran 
and to keep the contras going after official us aid was banned 
the case against poindexter is expected to go to trial in 
september 
before then a lowerranking figure in the affair former cia 
agent joseph f fernandez is to go to trial july 10 
fernandez has pleaded innocent to four charges that he lied and 
obstructed investigations by the presidential commission headed by 
former sen john tower and by the cias inspector general 
the former cia station chief in costa rica is accused of lying 
about his role in setting up an airstrip in costa rica as part of 
the reagan administrations effort to help the nicaraguan rebels at 
a time when official us aid was banned 
as for poindexter walsh has expressed determination to press 
forward against him with charges that were dropped against north 
that the two men and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v 
secord conspired to divert 15 million in usiran armssale 
profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
the independent counsel told us district judge aubrey e 
robinson jr that release of secret documents during norths trial 
and a softening of the intelligence agencies opposition to 
further disclosures may enable the prosecution to proceed with 
those charges against poindexter 
walsh also said that some of the most sensitive documents a 
judge ruled were needed in norths trial were not relevant to 
poindexters case 
many of the documents the government kept out of norths trial 
dealt with covert operations to free us hostages in the middle 
east and other secret activities in central america 
as a participant in covert operations north persuaded us 
district judge gerhard a gesell that he needed the material to 
help his defense when it was kept secret the conspiracy charges 
against north were dropped 
but walsh is expected to argue that since poindexter was not a 
participant in covert operations he is not entitled to use the 
same documents to defend the charges that he was a participant in a 
conspiracy to defraud the us government of armssale profits 
since north testified that poindexter knew of his role in the 
irancontra affair prosecutors may force the former national 
security council aide to testify against his former boss 
a judge could order north to testify against poindexter on 
condition that his testimony not be used as evidence against him if 
he is granted a new trial by an appellate court 
poindexter 52 is also charged with obstructing 1986 
investigations of the house and senate intelligence committees into 
the irancontra affair the charges include allegations he helped 
prepare a false chronology of the usiran arms deals and 
destroyed computerized files he kept at the nsc 
the seven charges against poindexter each carry fiveyear prison 
terms and 250000 fines 
after poindexters trial walshs office plans to proceed with 
the charges against hakim and secord also scheduled to be tried 
separately

israeli troops violated regulations and engaged 
in excessive use of fire in a raid on a west bank village last 
month that left five palestinians dead according to an army 
investigation released thursday 
the report calls for a police inquiry to determine if criminal 
charges should be filed against seven paramilitary border police 
involved in the incident in the village of nahalin near bethlehem 
said army spokesman lt col raanan gissin 
it also recommends that two border police commanders and one 
army commander be transferred from duty in the occupied territories 
and that another army commander be reprimanded he said 
there were discernable deviations from orders 
transgressions and excessive use of fire in the incident april 
13 gissin said 
the army says it has disciplined soldiers in about 50 cases in 
the 17month palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
thursdays report was unusual in its singling out highranking 
officers and its public release at a news conference 
but the strongest recommendation was that disciplinary action 
should be considered against police officers in its human 
rights report in february the us state deparment complained of 
lenient treatment of troops accused in fatalities and said many 
cases were not prosecuted 
also on thursday troops fatally shot a palestinian who broke 
through an army roadblock in the west bank and arab assailants 
shot to death a palestinian suspected of collaborating with israeli 
authorities 
the deaths brought to 460 the number of palestinians killed in

the pentagon is considering two options that 
could temporarily stave off elimination of the v22 osprey aircraft 
program deputy defense secretary donald atwood jr said thursday 
atwood told the senate appropriations defense subcommittee that 
the defense department is considering either continuing the osprey 
through a flight test program or a minimal effort of 
technology demonstration 
both options would require reprogramming of money according to 
atwood who said 330 million exists for longlead materials for 
production of 12 aircraft the funds could be used if congress 
approved 
we hope to have a decision within a matter of a day or so 
atwood told the panel 
defense secretary dick cheney faced with an agreement by the 
white house and congress requiring a 10 billion cut in the fiscal 
1990 defense budget decided to eliminate the marine corps 
battlefield aircraft which is designed to take off like a 
helicopter but fly like an airplane 
the pentagon had hoped to spend 259 billion on 663 ospreys 
including 13 billion in 1990 over a nineyear period the 
department had invested 2 billion in the program 
cheneys decision which he has termed his most difficult has 
met with considerable opposition on capitol hill including some 
from republicans 
sens ted stevens ralaska and arlen specter rpa lashed 
out at the termination of the program as they questioned atwood 
about the pentagon budget 
the defense department appears to be playing games with 
us stevens told atwood the defense department knows how 
strongly congress feels about it and intends to put it back in 
he added 
stevens said he would not vote for any defense bill that does 
not include funding for the osprey program 
specter who discussed the issue with atwood before the hearing 
said the department should explore the possibility of maintaining 
at least enough efforts to keep bell in operation to maintain the 
status quo while this matter is evaluated by the congress this is 
not some peripheral issue where the congress is likely to accede 
the pentagon faced a deadline because the ospreys two 
contractors bell helicopter textron inc and boeing helicopter 
co have said they will stop work on the project friday 
defense department spokesman dan howard said the companies 
received 2458 million in march on their fiscal 1989 contract and 
the navy expects completion of the contract 
however the companies are facing a debt of 27 million and have 
been using their own money the cost overrun is about 25 million a 
month and may go as high as 150 million by the end of fiscal 1989 
howard said what we have here is a game of highstakes 
chicken 
the intent of the dod is very clear we are not at fault the 
contractor has expended more money in the program than it 
anticipated when it bid howard said 
the secretarys determination has been that we will not issue 
a stopwork order that we will continue to require the contractor 
to complete the testing program under the terms of the contract 
howard said 
meanwhile the commandant of the marine corps cast doubt on the 
information cheney used in deciding to eliminate the osprey 
i do not agree with the cost advice that he got nor do i agree 
with the military operation use and conceptual framework of that 
but then im but one voice commandant alfred gray told the 
senate armed services committee 
gray praised the osprey as an aircraft that has enormous 
commercial potential and one that is not only for your corps 
marines nevertheless he said he supported cheneys decision 
do you believe secretary cheney made the best decision he 
could make based on faulty information asked sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the armed services committee 
no responded gray but based on the information he was 
given by learned people who have their right to believe that 
theyre correct 
but you dont believe theyre correct nunn said 
no i dont but i had my day in court said gray who plans 
to submit to the committee his interpretation of the programs cost 
benefits

property owners won the right to keep the 
public off a popular beach but as the sunbathing season 
approaches town officials say there will be no way to keep people 
off the sandy stretch 
it almost seems like were going back to square one back to 
where we started said joe magne one of the property owners who 
prevailed in a decision by the maines highest court 
the divided court ruled in march that public access to the 
milelong moody beach is limited to fishing birdhunting and 
boating on the basis of a 17th century colonial ordinance 
maines attorney general and officials from wells a town with a 
population of about 10000 fought to keep the beach open fearing 
a closed beach could harm the states tourism industry maines 
meandering coast is 3500 miles long but most of the shoreline is 
rocky just about 35 miles of sandy beaches are available 
wells town manager jonathan carter requested that moody beach 
property owners meet with town officials sunday to discuss two 
options for beach use this summer 
under the towns first proposal property owners would agree to 
make the beach public and the town will maintain it under the 
second option access to the beach would be controlled by the 
property owners but town officials point out that keeping 
unauthorized people away would be difficult 
if police are called with trespassing complaints they will 
handle the complaints like any other nonemergency carter said 
police would enter the beach through the complaining property 
owners home and the trespassers would merely have to move a few 
feet away onto another persons land to satisfy police carter said 
any complaints taken to court probably would get backlogged 
until the tourists are long gone the town manager said 
it would probably be put off until say november carter 
said 
carter rejected the suggestion that the town is using the threat 
of such delays to make property owners reluctant to complain about 
unwelcome tourists 
but property owners believe the town is trying to set up terms 
for beach use even though it lost in court 
to my way of thinking theyre sort of condoning 
trespassing said dr warren jones one of the litigants 
jones said people have used the area around his home and even 
under his steps as a toilet 
im not the old curmudgeon that wants to keep everyone from 
walking across his land jones said all we ever wanted was 
control of our own property if were planning a big family picnic 
i want to be able to ask people to leave 
some wells residents who dont own beachfront land see the 
property owners as meanspirited wealthy people trying to keep 
mainers and visitors from enjoying the beach 
thats nature out there said luke nuccio that doesnt 
belong to me or you or anyone natures for everybody native maine 
people never thought this could happen 
i plan to waitress in the morning and come to the beach in the 
afternoon this summer said schoolteacher ann french i never 
thought this would happen i think its going to bring out the 
worst in people 
both sides predict that no matter how the issue is resolved 
publicity given to the court case probably will keep some tourists 
away or at an adjacent public beach in ogunquit 
the battle over access to moody beach may finally be resolved 
with the town or the state seeking to acquire the beach through the 
governments legal right of eminent domain both sides said the 
town asked appraisal companies to submit proposals for the beach to 
buy as a recreational easement or to take fees for use of moody 
beach

oliver l north the marine at the shadowy 
center of the reagan administrations secret effort to arm the 
nicaragua contras was convicted thursday of shredding documents 
and two other charges in the irancontra affair he was acquitted 
on nine other counts 
north who faces up to 10 years in prison on the convictions 
accepted the verdict without any show of emotion but a congressal 
supporter described him as absolutely elated at the jurys 
decision 
after judge and jury had left the room north walked to a 
railing separating him from his wife betsy and kissed her lightly 
on the cheek mrs north had been sitting in the front row with a 
clergyman 
north left the courthouse with his wife and his lawyer they 
made no comments to the crowd of reporters and onlookers 
it was the first trial born of the scandal that marred the last 
two years of ronald reagans presidency and raised questions about 
then vice president george bushs involvment in the 
administrations clandestine effort to arm the contras even as the 
jury was returning its verdict bush told reporters at the white 
house that he did not participate in any arrangement to expedit aid 
to other countries in exchange for their support for the contras 
the white house said bush would have no comment on the verdict 
in los angeles former president reagan also declined comment 
norths defense was that he had been a good soldier loyally 
carrying out what he knew his commanderinchief the president 
wanted 
the principle that no man is above the law has been 
vindicated said prosecutor john keker who refused to answer 
reporters questions 
keker in a brief statement on the courthouse steps told 
reporters some said the system of justice could not deal 
effectively with this case some even said it could not be tried 
col north has been convicted of three very serious charges the 
jury has spoken 
north 45 was pale and smiling nervously as he entered the 
courtroom where his trial began with jury selection more than three 
months ago 
the former marine lieutenant colonel twice wounded in the 
vietnam war and decorated with the silver star for heroism 
remained seated while the judge read the verdict 
his three daughters and one son were not in the courtreoom 
which was crowded with reporters sketch artists lawyers and a few 
members of the public the nine women and three men on the jury did 
not look at north as they filed into their seats 
the panel found north guilty of three criminal charges 
shredding documents accepting an illegal gratuity and one count of 
aiding and abetting in an obstruction of congress 
us district judge gerhard a gesell set june 23 for 
sentencing the illegal gratuity conviction accepting a 13800 
security fence for his home carries a maximum penalty of two 
years in prison and a 250000 fine 
the conviction for destroying documents is punishable by a three 
year sentence and 250000 fine for obstruction of congress the 
maximum penalty is five years and 250000 it was unlikely that 
the prison terms if any would be consecutive 
rep henry hyde rill who had been one of norths chief 
defenders in the congressional irancontra hearings two years ago 
was in the courtroom for the verdict afterward he walked up to 
north at the defense table and shook his hand north smiled broadly 
rep dana rohrabacker r calif described north as 
absolutely elated 
we gave each other thumbs up said rohrabacker a former 
white house aide for whom north campaigned last year he said the 
jury found north guilty of only cutting corners and not breaking 
the law 
north had arrived in the courtroom with his lawyers at 220 
pm about 50 minutes after the judge received a note from the 
jury that a verdict had been reached they had been at their task 
for 64 hours spread over 12 days 
north a marine lieutenant colonel detailed to the national 
security council was the key figure in the twoyear effort to help 
the rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist government after congress 
banned official us aid 
he was involved too in arrangements under which the united 
states secretly sold arms to iran and he also helped divert some 
profits from those sales to help the contras 
public disclosure of the affair in november 1986 began the worst 
crisis of president reagans eightyear presidency a public furor 
that didnt subside until after televised congressional hearings 
that made north a national figure 
his lawyers had asked reagan to testify in his behalf but the 
former president refused and the judge upheld his position 
president bush too was subpoenaed and that summons also was 
quashed 
their names surfaced however as the trial spotlighted once 
again the bitterness dividing the reagan administration which 
wanted to help the guerrillas fighting the leftist nicaraguan 
government and the congress which banned such aid between 
mid1984 and mid1986 
documents released during the trial showed bush may have been 
aware of plans to increase us aid to honduras in exchange for 
that countrys giving sanctuary to the contras they suggested 
too that he and reagan were far more deeply involved in the contra 
cause than has been acknowledged before 
a government admission described how reagan bush and other 
top government officials took part in elaborate efforts to induce 
third countries to give military support to the guerrillas in 
return for favors and aid from the united states these were the 
socalled quid pro quo arrangements 
the charges dealt not with norths clandestine activities on 
behalf of the contras at a time when congress ordered all us 
aid withheld but with the former national security council aides 
attempts to cover up his efforts 
the jury convicted north of falsifying and destroying documents 
in november 1986 as the affair was about to become public and of 
accepting an illegal gratuity a 13800 home security system 
from irancontra codefendant richard secord 
north also was convicted of aiding and abetting in obstruction 
of congress by falsifying a chronology of events in the affair the 
false chronology stated that no one in the us government knew 
until january 1986 that a ciaassisted shipment from israel to iran 
in november 1985 contained hawk missiles 
he was acquitted of five other charges of lying to or 
obstructing congress of two counts of lying to thenattorney 
general edwin meese iii and obstructing meeses inquiry into the 
affair of converting travelers checks to his own use and of 
conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service by using a 
taxexempt foundation to raise funds for the contras

beirut the heart of the christian enclave 
the cypriot ferry larnaca rose making its first voyage to 
lebanon since fighting forced it to stop the journeys april 24 was 
ordered by its agents to turn back as the firing escalated after 
nighfall the ferry is one of the few escape methods for christians 
trying to flee the enclave 
arab league mediators accused syrias moslem allies of violating 
the truce declared in the 2monthold battle between gen michel 
aouns christian army units and an alliance of syrian forces and 
druse militiamen 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate given in 1976 a year after the sectarian 
civil war began and has become the countrys main power broker

the arab league said before departure we remain fully 
optimistic that the truce adopted by the arab league last week 
will be implemented

about lifting blockades of ports delayed its implementation 
moslems say the provision includes illegal harbors run by 
militias which aouns forces blockaded march 6

separately wednesday with aoun who heads a christian cabinet in 
lebanons dual government and acting premier salim hoss who leads 
the moslem government 
lebanons government split in september when the sixyear term 
of amin gemayel the christian president ended with parliament 
unable to agree on a successor the army also divided into 
christian and moslem commands 
after his meeting with the general ibrahimi said the 
differences over the ports had been eliminated and declared 
theres no justification for a single shot to be fired in lebanon 
from now on

night and thursday however 
jassem the other envoy said thursday the ceasefire is 
being violated from west beirut and not from east beirut the 
citys christian sector he spoke to reporters after meeting with

announcement by gen aoun that he will suspend temporarily his 
blockade of the ports said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
in a statement carried by the voice of lebanon a christian 
radio station jassem said the arab league effort was not a magic 
wand

vice president dan quayle 
visited thousands of cambodian refugees at their remote dusty camp 
thursday to call the attention of the world to their plight 
in a dramatic finale of the asian leg of his 12day trip quayle 
and his wife marilyn traveled for two hours by military transport 
plane helicopter and limousine to reach this camp of bamboo and 
thatched houses just six miles from the thaicambodian border and 
some 250 miles from bangkok 
today is to call the attention of the world to what is going 
on these poor kids here the sick he said 
the refugees want to return to their home in cambodia and 
yet they cant because of the illegal occupation by vietnam he 
said he called the plight of cambodians something that has been 
overlooked its a tragedy a human tragedy 
quayle the highestranking american to visit a refugee camp in 
thailand was given a heros welcome by villagers many of whom 
have lived at site b for a decade awaiting word as to when they can 
return to cambodia 
the dirt road from the camps entrance to a central square where 
quayle made a brief speech in the broiling sun was lined for nearly 
two miles with children waving paper american thai and cambodian 
flags 
i hope his visit will help me go home said vu thi a 
40yearold woman who fled cambodia a decade ago 
some 10000 people mainly women and children greeted quayle 
who frequently leaned over a rope barrier to touch the youngsters 
pat their stomachs or pose for photographs with them 
later quayle said he found his visit to a medical clinic at the 
wellmaintained camp very depressing he saw mothers sitting on 
bamboo beds surrounded by their sick children 
the vice president used his visit to underscore what has been a 
dominant theme of his australiapacific trip cambodias future 
once the vietnamese troops withdraw sept 30 
we will continue our support for the noncommunist 
resistance until there is a complete withdrawal and a 
political settlement quayle said looking out on a sea of people 
protecting themselves from the sun with umbrellas 
vietnam no and usa strong supporter of cambodia 
read large banners hoisted by the crowd 
the camp is run by prince norodom ranariddh the son of prince 
norodom sihanouk cambodias former leader whom washington wants to 
head a transitional government once vietnamese troops leave 
quayle met with sihanouk in indonesia the second southeast 
asian country he visited 
part of quayles mission has been to gather information for 
presidents bushs policy review on cambodia the two will meet for 
lunch friday after the vice president returns to washington 
one option is providing military assistance to the noncommunist 
factions while washington would prefer a diplomatic to a military 
solution in cambodia it is adamant about refusing to permit the 
chinesebacked khmer rouge to dominate any future government 
the khmer rouge were responsible for killing at least 15 
million people in cambodia between 1975 and 1978 cambodias 
current leader hun sen was installed by vietnam 
security was tight at the camp where 60000 people live with 
secret service agents in flak jackets wielding assault rifles 
quayle had initially planned to tour a larger camp site 2 but 
the location was changed several days ago because the vice 
presidents aides thought recent shelling believed to be coming 
from cambodia would place quayle in too much danger 
the site b camp where quayle stayed two hours receives much of 
its aid through the un border relief operation 
mitchell carlson a un worker said the camp residents have 
very little they can do at the camp he described the place as 
a welfare state with about onethird of the population under 
10 years old 
more than 300000 cambodians live in thai camps where they are 
classified as displaced people and are unable to leave they are 
hoping that sihanouks and the other cambodian factions can arrive 
at a solution so they can go home 
quayle left thailand on thursday made a refueling stop in japan 
and was heading for alaska for a brief tour of the cleanup 
operations from the march oil spill in prince william sound before 
returning to washington

donald j trump a consummate 
player in the highstakes serious world of big business visited 
the nations oldest game manufacturer thursday to herald new 
editions of trump the game 
female workers at the milton bradley co screeched when he 
passed by and one cried when he bussed her on the cheek he 
kissed me he kissed me said a shaky grace adams of springfield 
who has worked 31 years at the company 
the new york city and atlantic city nj real estate mogul 
flew to the western massachusetts factory of 2300 workers in his 
black private helicopter to fulfill a promise to the company which 
expects trump the game to be the biggest seller in its 129year 
history despite its 25 pricetag 
they were intent on having me come up to meet the real 
people trump said these are the people doing the work 
employees clapped at each stop in the 45minute visit women 
sighed isnt he handsome and men lined up for autographs on 
the game money that bears his likeness and comes in denominations 
no smaller than 10 million 
more than 2 million games are scheduled for production by years 
end it is the no 1 seller in the 300 stores that have received 
advance copies milton bradley president george ditomassi said 
neither the company nor trump will reveal his royalties from the 
game but both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the 
homeless and for research on aids cerebral palsy and multiple 
sclerosis 
the board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first 
bid against each other for airlines casinos luxury hotels and 
other major properties then try to negotiate deals 
if you dont do well at this game you should stay on 
9to5 trump advised adding that the game is tough even for a 
veteran like him 
but he resisted explaining its appeal if i said it youd say 
i have a big ego so why say it 
although several game manufacturers tried to peddle their ideas 
to trump the one that caught his eye came from an independent 
inventor from chicago who suggested milton bradley as a 
manufacturer 
trump said he settled on the nations largest board game maker 
because the loyalty decisiveness and professionalism of this 
company is just unbelievable

in a spinoff from the trial of oliver north 
the house intelligence committee on thursday began investigating 
why congress did not get white house documents on a secret deal 
with honduras to aid the nicaraguan contras 
the committees investigation is in response to a request from 
rep lee hamilton dind who was chairman of the house committee 
that investigated the irancontra affair in 1987 it is similar to 
an investigation being carried out by the senate intelligence 
committee 
documents that surfaced at the north trial show that president 
reagan approved a deal in which the united states would expedite 
economic and military aid to honduras in return for that countrys 
continued help for the contras who were encamped just inside 
honduras along the border with nicaragua 
the documents together with testimony during norths trial 
suggest that senior officials up to and including reagan and 
thenvice president george bush were more involved in the affair 
than the congressional committees knew 
the situation has been further clouded by administration 
contentions that there was no quid pro quo deal with honduras 
to aid the contras an action that would have been illegal at the 
time because of congressional prohibitions 
bush himself repeated the assertion thursday giving reporters 
the word of the president of the united states that there was 
no quid pro quo and promising to turn over to congress records of 
his 1985 meeting with the honduran president 
those assertions conflict directly with the documentary 
evidence which shows there not only was such a plan but that it 
apparently was carried out 
the white house has offered to make available to congress former 
white house counsel arthur b culvahouse jr who oversaw the 
document search for the congressional irancontra committees and 
gave assurances that all relevant documents had been provided 
at the same time rep david obey dwis said he would hold up 
us aid to central america until the bush administration answers 
questions raised by the north trial documents 
i do have an obligation to get those answers before we provide 
any additional assistance to the same countries said obey 
chairman of the house appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee 
the north documents would seem to lead to some very troubling 
conclusions about the use of foreign aid to persuade aid recipients 
to provide foreign aid to the contras at a time when providing aid 
to the contras was against official american government policy 
obey said 
in their request for an investigation senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine and sens daniel inouye dhawaii and 
warren rudman rnh said a preliminary staff analysis had turned 
up four documents released at norths trial which the congressional 
investigators never saw 
in addition two other documents were missing cover sheets or 
notations or were incomplete in other crucial ways they said 
one an april 25 1985 memo from robert mcfarlane who at the 
time was the national security adviser recommended that reagan 
telephone honduran president roberto suazo to reassure him of us 
backing for the contras missing from the congressional copy is the 
notation cc vice president apparently signaling that george 
bush was sent a copy of the memo 
among documents the congressional panels never received were a 
feb 19 1985 memo outlining a plan to step up us aid to 
honduras in return for that nations support of the contras and a 
memo dated the following day making it clear that the 
administration knew it was forbidden from providing aid under those 
circumstances 
also not turned over to congressional investigators was an oct 
30 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane about reconnaissance of 
nicaragua and mentioning the air drop of two recoilless rifles to 
the rebels

secretary of state james a baker iii 
challenged the soviet union on thursday to fulfill mikhail 
gorbachevs promises of reform saying the administration intends 
to test the application of soviet new thinking again and 
again 
bakers outline of us policy toward the soviet union comes as 
he prepares to leave monday on a fiveday trip that includes his 
first moscow meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
it also occurs during a crisis within the nato alliance as the 
united states is struggling with its allies on forging a strategy 
to deal with gorbachevs troop reduction and arms control 
initiatives 
the secretarys remarks the result of a longawaited review of 
ussoviet policy undertaken since president bush took office more 
than three months ago were contained in a speech prepared for 
delivery to members of the center for strategic and international 
studies a washington think tank 
while applauding such moves such as the withdrawal of troops 
from afghanistan and the agreement banning all us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles in europe baker complained 
that soviet behavior still does not square with the slogans of 
perestroika 
the secretary said the united states intends to build on the 
progress made in the human rights and arms control arenas in 
particular suggesting a date for the continuation of the strategic 
arms talks the talks dealing with the most dangerous weapons in 
the us and soviet arsenal went into recess late last year 
but baker said he intends to go to moscow to broaden the 
ussoviet agenda seeking to focus on regional conflicts the 
proliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons and other 
issues such as terrorism the environment and drug abuse 
the president has said and i have said that we have no wish 
to see perestroika fail to the contrary we would very much like 
it to succeed said baker a process that promises to 
increase the freedom and improve the wellbeing of the soviet 
peoples is in everyones interest 
the secretary said it is too early to tell whether gorbachevs 
new thinking known by the russian name perestroika will 
succeed or not 
and as baker challenged the soviets to do more he offered no 
specific us overtures to encourage soviet concessions 
unfortunately there are still many regions where the new 
thinking has yet to take root we still see many signs of the old 
thoughts and the old actions in central america where the soviets 
sent over 500 million in aid to the sandinistas last year baker 
said 
he cited soviet shipments of longrange bombers to libyas 
moammar khadafy soviet military support of militant north korea 
and the soviet occupation of japans northern territories 
at a time when we hear talk of unilateral reductions of the 
need to cut defense spending and of the necessity to transfer 
precious resources from the military economy to the civilian 
sector 3500 new soviet tanks continue to roll off the production 
lines each year a production rate five times greater than our 
own baker said 
the secretary faulted the soviets for failing to publish a 
real defense budget one that would allow an independent 
evaluation of gorbachevs military spending and his pledge to slash 
his defense spending by 14 percent 
he also complained that while there has been talk of a common 
european home the berlin wall still stands and the brezhnev 
doctrine which affirms the right to send soviet troops into other 
east european countries has not been repealed 
baker added that the united states does not intend to sit 
quietly and await the outcome of gorbachevs reforms 
our policy must be to press forward with our agenda to test 
the application of soviet new thinking again and again baker 
said 
on arms control baker suggested the soviets come clean in 
the conventional force talks going on in vienna and engage in 
careful reductions that diminish the threat to the west 
baker said the administration intends to press the soviets to 
make human rights and democratization changes a permanent part of 
the soviet political system and legal code 
by testing moscow across the board we have the opportunity to 
turn many of the opportunities presented by the new thinking into 
realities we can establish frameworks and baselines for common 
dialogue in areas where no real dialogue or basis for cooperation 
now exists baker argued 
the secretary said the administration intends to find out 
whether the new thinking is real once we probe beyond the 
slogans and we can also determine where the old thinking still 
holds sway

president bush said thursday he would not 
accept any agreement to resolve a crisis in nato if it would lead 
to the abolition of shortrange nuclear weapons in western europe 
rather than curbing nuclear weapons bush said nato should put 
its emphasis on trying to get the soviet union to reduce its 
overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons he said 
negotiations should be conducted outside the public spotlight to 
resolve the nato dispute 
against the wishes of the united states and britain west 
germany has demanded the opening of negotiations soon with the 
soviet union to curb shortrange nuclear weapons chancellor helmut 
kohl also opposes us and british efforts to more than triple the 
range of natos lance missiles to about 250 miles 
the dispute threatens to rupture the harmony of a nato summit 
may 2930 that is intended to showcase the strength and unity of 
the western alliance 
i want the nato summit to be a success and we will be working 
with the germans and with others to see that there is a common nato 
position bush said this is no time for one to compromise or 
somebody not to compromise 
bush said im always willing to negotiate but were not 
going to go for any third zero the elimination of the shortrange 
weapons or getting snf another term for the weapons out of whack 
in terms of negotiations so lets get clear on that 
the president made his comments in an informal question and 
answer session outside the diplomatic entrance of the white house 
after a meeting with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
canada is circulating a compromise in nato that calls for 
negotiations with the soviets on shortrange nuclear weapons with 
the understanding all lances would not be uprooted and the warsaw 
pacts edge in conventional forces would be erased the deal would 
permit modernizing the missiles first 
mulroney stressed the need for nato members to stand together 
and credited solidarity and american leadership for the strength of 
the alliance 
and so while there has to be this kind of debate in the end 
there must be solidarity total solidarity mulroney said and 
there must be a common view of leadership which has served the 
world so well for 40 years 
referring to nato mulroney said this is not an association 
where everybody freelances we have a common nato position and 
while there are divergence of views that emerge from time to time 
the object of getting together is to harmonize those views into one 
position 
bush said he felt the dispute should be resolved in quiet 
negotiations 
theres a lot of public discussion of this issue and thats 
fine bush said i dont plan in detail to join in on that 
public discussion 
bush said the united states had made some proposals to west 
germany and i expect well be hearing from them soon white 
house officials said privately that bush was not referring to any 
new proposal to deal with the problem posed by west germanys 
demands 
rather bush was referring to a monthsold us proposal for an 
overall approach for natos defense the officials said 
on other matters at the news conference bush 
said he will meet in the next few days with his science 
adviser physicist d allan bromley about claims of producing 
nuclear fusion in a jar of water 
gave his enthusiastic backing to demands by chinese 
students who have staged huge prodemocracy demonstrations 
said he was in the final stages of working on stricter 
acidrain standards that would be part of overall clean air 
legislation for his part mulroney said i applaud the leaership 
the president is giving to the environment particularly of the 
question of acid rain 
warned of unspecified action against panama if there is fraud 
in sundays election the world will be looking at them not just 
the united states in terms of these elections and deciding what to 
do if the elections are fraudulent

both in the congressional hearings in 1987 and during his 
threemonth trial norths defense had been that he had 
authorization for everything he did from two successive bosses 
national security advisers robert f mcfarlane and poindexter and 
concurrence from the late cia director william c casey 
he said he assumed that reagan who spoke out often in support 
of the contra cause also knew of his efforts and approved them 
reagan told the investigative tower commission two years ago that 
he did not know of his nsc staffs efforts to help the contras 
north said he had been led to believe that everything i was 
doing was done at the direction of the president 
the jury in norths trial was instructed by gesell that 
neither the president nor any of the defendants superiors had 
the legal authority to order anyone to violate the law 
north was his own chief witness spending six days on the stand 
much of it under withering cross examination he testified that 
in november 1986 with the irancontra affair about to be revealed 
he shredded and altered documents on a list mcfarlane had prepared 
on the stand under the gentle prodding of his lawyer and the 
ferocious crossexamination of his prosecutor north readily 
admitted that he altered and shredded documents and that he lied 
to congress he said he did it to keep secret what he had been told 
was secret 
i was raised to know the difference between right and wrong 
he testified i knew it wasnt right not to tell the truth on 
those things but i didnt think it was unlawful 
the jury of nine women and three men whose minimum 
qualification was that they had not heard or watched norths 
televised appearance at the 1987 congressional hearings had not 
given any indication during their long deliberations on what was 
holding up a verdict 
wearing dark business suits and answering yes sir and no 
sir the oliver north in court was far different from the 
truculent combative marine with six rows of ribbons on his chest 
who aimed his passionate oratory and unflagging patriotism a 
nationwide audience of millions in the summer of 1987 
the story that unfolded in court was a familiar one north 
rallied private support provided strategy and supplied munitions 
to the guerrillas fighting the leftist nicaraguan government when 
congress beginning in 1984 banned us military when congress 
asked in 1985 and 1986 what he and the national council had been 
doing north admittedly lied but said he did it to save lives of 
american supporters 
to a lesser extent the testimony touched on the secret arms 
sales to iran a failed effort to free american hostages held in 
lebanon and the funneling of profits from those sales to the 
contras north was fired by reagan when the diversion became public 
knowledge and fingered by attorney general edwin meese iii asthe 
only person in the us government who knew what was going on 
the same day however the president telephoned north to say 
youre a national hero 
it appeared before and during the trial that the criminal case 
against north would founder because the government was unwilling to 
allow some of its most deeplyheld secrets to be aired in open 
court thus depriving north of a fair trial 
but gesell trod the fine line between keeping secrets and fair 
trial he reluctantly allowed four security experts to monitor 
testimony and evidence and largely succeeded in avoiding a 
stopandgo cuckooclock trial he said he didnt want 
still to be tried are three others charged along with north 
former national security adviser john m poindexter businessman 
albert hakim and richard secord a retired air force major general 
they had pivotal roles in what north called the secret within 
the secret using profits from the iranian arms sales for the 
contras 
there is no claim that the diversion of money to the contras 
from the sale of arms to elements in iran is illegal gesell told 
the jury when it received the case on april 20 he told them too 
that it is wholly irrelevant and immaterial in this case whether 
or not the presidents commitment to aid the contras was or was not 
sound national policy 
reagan made no secret of that commitment and there was testimony 
that he said the contras had to be kept intact body and soul 
until congress restored military aid it cut off via the socalled 
boland amendment from 1984 to 1986 
after the verdict a contra spokesman said that from the 
nicaraguan point of view we are grateful to oliver north for all 
that he has done in the past for the cause of democratizing 
nicaragua 
but from the legal point of view this is a matter of the laws 
of the united states and the sovereign jurors have rendered their 
verdict said spokesman aristides sanchez 
north was referred to as the action officer for central 
american affairs within the national security council vincent 
cannistraro a highlevel cia official testified that casey once 
decreed that with reagans approval north was both the 
spokesman and the principal point of reference for sustaining the 
contras 
testimony at norths threemonth trial including his own 
reinforced his image as the cando marine on the national 
security council staff who supplied the nicaraguan contras with 
munitions and tactics while us aid was banned sold arms to iran 
at a profit and used the money for the contras 
he was not charged for those acts but with lying about them 
when asked by congress and meese to explain his actions and the 
nscs involvement 
when north was indicted by a grand jury in march 1988 the 
charges included two broad counts of conspiracy to defraud the 
united states and theft of government property 
but independent counsel lawrence walsh citing insurmountable 
problems created by the mountain of classified information that 
would have to be produced asked that those charges be dropped and 
they were 
the north trial delayed by arguments over what national 
security secrets could be told began on jan 31 prosecutors 
called 32 witnesses the defense had 16 including north himself 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of 
withholding information from congress and was sentenced to 200 
hours of community service in another courtroom before he testified 
at norths trial poindexter is scheduled to stand trial later this 
year on charges similar to some of those against north

president bush denied emphatically thursday 
that he took part in any scheme to swap us aid for honduran 
assistance to the nicaraguan rebels saying he wanted an end to 
needless mindless speculation about his role 
the word of the president of the united states george bush 
is there was no quid pro quo he declared moments before a 
federal jury convicted fired white house aide oliver north on three 
criminal charges in connection with the irancontra affair 
speaking of a meeting he had as vice president in the spring of 
1985 with thenhonduran president roberto suazo bush said the 
records of the meeting demonstrate there was no quid pro quo 
bush had said several times in recent weeks that he would await 
the conclusion of norths trial before considering a definitive 
comment on questions that have arisen in connection with that 
meeting 
but on thursday standing alongside visiting canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney bush seemed eager to talk about recently 
disclosed documents that placed him at a meeting with suazo in 
honduras at a time when internal reagan administration memos 
suggested a plan to link continuing us aid to latin american 
countries to their willingness to help the contra rebels 
the socalled findings of fact a 42page document presented 
in the north trial in early april suggested that bush as vice 
president had played a role as an intermediary in assuring suazo 
that his countrys assistance to the contras would be rewarded with 
expedited us financial aid however the document did not say 
directly that bush discussed the deal with suazo 
it did say that bush explained to the hondurans that they were 
to receive a great deal more us aid and that that statement was a 
part of the purported quid pro quo policy of the administration at 
that time 
the government did not dispute the facts as presented although 
state department officials subsquently said that the document 
presented a distorted picture of us policy and actions in the 
region during a period in 1985 and 1986 when the us government 
was barred from directly or indirectly aiding the rebels 
everybody that attended the meeting says that there was no 
quid pro quo bush said thursday and for those who suggest 
there was the onus is on them he said 
thank you for asking that question 
the president declined to answer specifically when asked whether 
he had discussed contra aid with suazo asked whether he had known 
of any quid pro quo arrangements between the us government and 
honduras he replied not to my knowledge 
the president complained that there has been much needless 
mindless speculation about my word of honor and ive answered it 
now definitively 
this came a little more than a week after bush told reporters 
that my conscience is clear on the irancontra affair 
bush had said last week that he had had no discussions with 
anyone about a possible pardon for north and on thursday deputy 
press secretary stephen hart said only we wont have any 
comment on norths conviction 
the former national security council staff deputy was acquitted 
on nine charges bush last year called north a national hero 
but later refined that to say he was alluding to norths record of 
heroism in military combat 
the president also said in an interview with british broadcast 
journalist david frost that he believed that north had made 
mistakes in connection with the armstoiran initiative and the 
resulting diversion of money to the contras but said he thought 
that americans were sympathetic to north because he had stood up 
for what he believed 
bush maintained that cables describing his meeting with suazo 
demonstrate that there was no quid pro quo no implication 
no quid quo pro direct or indirect from me to the president of 
honduras at that meeting 
he said that in the aftermath of the north trial i will 
insist that the congressional committees now that the jury is 
in be briefed thoroughly on the confidential cables describing 
the meeting 
i can now state declaratively without any fear of 
contradiction that there wasnt a quid pro quo he said 
bush did not say whether he had personally reviewed the cables 
that he alluded to in his statements to reporters press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said recently that bush had told aides privately 
that he was not part of any quid pro quo arrangements with the 
hondurans 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush is 
willing to have members of congressional committees briefed by 
state department officials regarding any questions they might have 
about the suazo meeting 
but he said that bush would not submit to questions from 
lawmakers although he reiterated that the white house position is 
to help in any way we can in an efforts by lawmakers to learn 
about documents that were never seen by the irancontra committees 
bush repeated thursday that he believes the panels should work 
with ab culvahouse white house counsel during the last reagan 
years to resolve any conflicts about documents provided the 
committees 
the position is exactly the same as its been for the last 
three years we are not investigating ourselves the spokesman 
said but we want to cooperate in any way that we can

the united states and nicaragua said 
thursday they are about to exchange diplomats again 10 months 
after expelling each others envoys because of an opposition march 
the government ended by force 
jose leon talavera deputy foreign minister said the exchanges 
involves diplomats below the rank of ambassador and replacing 
ambassadors will be discussed later 
we dont know the reason for this sudden change of attitude 
by the united states he said its probably their famous 
carrotandstick policy but this carrot is so small it takes a 
magnifying glass to see it 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said seven us diplomats were being sent to managua and nicaragua 
would be allowed to post the same number 
lois mervin a us embassy spokeswoman said it was an 
administrative move and not a change in policy 
nicaragua expelled ambassador richard melton and seven other 
us diplomats last july 11 accusing them of scheming to undermine 
the sandinista government 
it acted the day after police broke up the opposition march in 
nandaime 40 miles south of managua scores of people were injured 
including policemen 
several embassy diplomats were at the march but us officials 
said they had attended only as observers 
washington retaliated by expelling ambassador carlos tunnermann 
and seven other nicaraguan diplomats 
the expulsions led to a visa war nicaragua began requiring 
15 days notice before issuing visas to us diplomats the united 
states stopped sending diplomats and refused visas to nicaraguan 
officials 
that meant embassy staffers could not be replaced so both 
embassies have been in the hands of junior diplomats 
nicaraguas leftist government had offered to end the visa 
restrictions on jan 20 inauguration day for president bush 
talavera said the united states responded last weekend telling 
nicaragua it would replace seven officials he said they were 
expected next week 
this week washington authorized a number of visas so we could 
replace our expelled people talavera said adding that nicaragua 
would have four new diplomats at its embassy by the end of may

violenceprone hospital patients can be largely 
tamed if healthcare workers help identify repetitive troublemakers 
and take precautions when they check in researchers said thursday 
one key to the success of any such program is winning the 
cooperation of hospital employees who often are ashamed to report 
they have been attacked by a patient said david j drummond a 
psychologist at the oregon health sciences university in portland 
ore 
theres a strong tendency among staff members to feel like 
gee i must have done something wrong if this patient hit me 
drummond said in a telephone interview 
drummond developed a violencereduction program at the veterans 
administration medical center and outpatient clinic in portland and 
his account was published in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
in his study of 36 patients the number of reported violent 
incidents per visit fell more than 85 percent in the 12 months 
following the programs implementation compared with the previous 
12 months 
an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal said the 
portland program seemed to place staff safety ahead of patient 
rights a charge that drummond denied 
the program required staff members to report all patient threats 
or violence against people or hospital property as well as 
situations requiring police or hospital security 
the incidents ranged from verbal threats to armed hostagetaking 
drummond said it took 2 years for the hospitals behavioral 
emergency committee to develop the reporting forms and to persuade 
staffers to use them 
the committee identified 48 patients all men with an average 
age of 449 years as high risks for violent behavior and 
flagged their computerized medical files to alert staffers of 
their potential for violence 
the flags consisted of brief messages such as patient should 
be searched for weapons or hospital police should be asked to 
stand by until released by examining clinician 
because of the flag a nurse or physician now has the benefit 
of others experience with the patient and may arrange for 
appropriate measures before walking into an examination room 
drummond wrote 
what we find with many patients tending to be disruptive is 
that if you get enough folks together in an examining area you end 
up communicating a message to the patient that we are not going to 
tolerate any acting out or disruption while we give you medical 
care he said 
the study period ran from 1986 through 1987 with the flagging 
program implemented at the beginning of 1987 six of the 48 
subjects were excluded from the study because they were flagged for 
incidents that occurred before 1986 and did not visit the hospital 
during the study period six others were excluded because their 
medical records were not available for review drummond said 
the number of hospital visits by the remaining 36 subjects 
decreased 422 percent in 1987 to 147 from 254 in 1986 the number 
of violent incidents fell by 916 percent to four from 47 
dr burr eichelman of dorothea dix hospital in raleigh nc 
took issue with the program writing in an editorial that it was 
unclear whether the program contained safeguards to prevent 
hospital staff members from entering false information into a 
patients file or to prevent the release to lawenforcement 
agencies of confidential information about patient behavior 
we cannot take lightly the potential for abuses of patient 
rights in this computer age even in the name of patient and staff 
safety eichelman wrote 
drummond said he was the only person authorized to flag patients 
for disruptive behavior and that the confidentiality of patient 
files was closely guarded

president bush in his first public comments 
on the massive prodemocracy demonstrations that have rocked china 
in recent weeks gave his enthusiastic backing to many demands 
by the chinese students 
but the president who served as the first us liaison officer 
to beijing when the united states opened relations with china under 
president nixon declined to specifically criticize the chinese 
government which has sought to stop the demonstrations 
i have words of encouragement for freedom and democracy 
wherever and i would like to see progress in china in the soviet 
union and in other systems that have heretofore not been in the 
forefront to put it mildly of human rights or of democratic 
rights and i wouldnt suggest that to any leadership of any 
country that they accept every demand by every group 
however the president told a news conference on the white house 
lawn that he has reviewed the demands by the hundreds of thousands 
of students who have taken to the streets of beijing and other 
chinese cities 
we can certainly as the united states identify with them 
bush mentioned the demand for press freedom and said he forgot 
other specific demands but stated a lot of them had my 
enthusiastic backingin a broad generic sense and i would like to 
encourage china or the soviet union or other totalitarian 
countriesto move as quick as they can down democracys path 
bush said that since he lived in china in 1975 ive been 
pleased with some of the changes in china its changed 
dramatically 
but theyve got a ways to go and other countries in this 
hemisphere have a long ways to go and countries in europe have a 
long way to go 
bush has spoken often and forcefully in favor of the forces 
opposing oppressive regimes in such places as poland and nicaragua 
but has been quiet on china 
bushs comments came as some 100000 people occupied beijings 
tiananmen square to mark the 70th anniversary of chinas first 
student movement 
the crowd mostly students defied police and peacefully 
gathered for a festive rally to seek greater freedom cleaner 
government a free press and official recognition of the new 
independent student union that authorities say is illegal 
students held much smaller demonstrations in shanghai nanjing 
and changsha 
chinas communist leaders initially said the student marches 
were designed to undermine chinas government but in recent days 
has said that the demonstrators are being manipulated by 
unspecified people and that most protesting students are patriotic 
student activists on thursday indicated that after six 
successful marches in defiance of the government they indicated 
future activity may not center on demonstrations

a proposal to lift courtimposed restrictions 
on the seven regional bell telephone companies drew opposition in a 
house committee thursday from newspaper publishers and other 
telephone companies 
the bill cosponsored by reps al swift dwash and tom 
tauke riowa would lift restraints imposed when the bell system 
was broken up by a federal consent decree in 1984 
those restraints prevent the regional bell companies from 
manufacturing telecommunications equipment and offering information 
services such as electronic yellow pages computer data bases and 
home shopping and banking 
opening hearings on the legislation and new telecommunications 
policy the telecommunications subcommittee of the house energy and 
commerce committee heard opposition to the bill from david e 
easterly president of cox newspapers who represented the american 
newspaper publishers association and william t esrey president 
and chief executive officer of united telecommunications inc and 
us sprint communications co 
easterly said the bell companies should remain banned from 
providing electronic publishing services because as operators of 
the local phone systems they control the delivery system and have 
the ability to harm competitors trying to use it to sell electronic 
publishing products 
the phone companies have to be banned from publishing over 
their own lines easterly said 
the potential for abuse is absolutely enormous he said 
william l weiss chairman and chief executive officer of 
ameritech corp one of the local bell companies supported the 
legislation and said the restriction on information services was 
added to the consent decree to pacify special interest groups 
who wanted to preserve their competitive advantage 
weiss said the real issue in their debate with newspaper 
publishers is advertising as electronic yellow pages would be in 
competition with electronic classified ads that some newspapers may 
want to offer via home video or computer services 
wed like to take our own business yellow pages and move it 
forward with technology weiss said

dr c everett koop the bearded surgeon 
general whose straight talk about smoking aids and abortion made 
him a lightning rod for critics from the right and the left said 
thursday he will resign after seven years as the nations top 
health officer 
during his tenure koop lived up to his reputation as a 
toughminded professional and made what had been a figurehead 
position into a pulpit from which he hammered at the ills of 
smoking and became the nations no 1 promoter of condoms in the 
fight against aids 
something of a celebrity koop appeared often on television talk 
shows and was easily recognized by his silver beard and the 
goldtrimmed uniform of the commissioned corps of the us public 
health service which he usually wore at public events 
in a brief letter to president bush delivered thursday koop 
said he had told the president in february he would not serve out 
his full second term which ends in november koop told bush he 
would leave the job july 13 and retire oct 1 
bush writing back to koop that he accepted the resignation 
with regret praised koops knowledge wisdom conviction and 
courage 
the president credited koop with tackling some of the toughest 
public health issues facing our country and said he had been a 
genuine leader an example to all americans whatever their 
profession or responsibility 
the secretary of health and human services louis sullivan 
applauded koops work saying he has been a voice of honesty 
integrity compassion and plain good sense 
koop said in his letter to bush that james mason assistant 
secretary for health will name an acting surgeon general once the 
office is vacant the surgeon general heads the 6000member 
commissioned corps of the health service which is part of the 
health department 
koop 72 did not say what he planned to do but has said in 
interviews that he wants to write books and work in television on 
health issues he now earns 91200 including housing and uniform 
allowances 
koop could not be reached for comment his office said he was on 
his way to geneva switzerland for a world health organization 
meeting 
president reagans 1981 nomination of koop then 
surgeoninchief of the childrens hospital of philadelphia set 
off a bitter ninemonth battle for senate confirmation 
a pediatric surgeon with an international reputation koop was 
strongly opposed by liberals who feared him as an antiabortion 
crusader who lacked experience with public health issues 
but he turned most of those critics around many of them when he 
issued a nononsense report on the aids crisis in october 1986 that 
advocated the use of condoms and explicit sex education about how 
the deadly virus is spread 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of a house health 
subcommittee had voiced deep misgivings when koop was named 
surgeon general saying dr koop scares me he is a man of 
tremendous intolerance 
but on thursday waxman said 
one of the great surprises of the last eight years is how 
wrong i was i take a great deal of pleasure in admitting how wrong 
i was if they could find a clone of koop they ought to appoint 
him 
conservatives at first embraced koop a member of an oldline 
evangelical presbyterian church and a board member of several major 
antiabortion groups but later lost faith they were especially 
angered by the aids report and koops advocacy of condoms and sex 
education saying the result was to encourage promiscuity among 
young people 
the approach he advocated deeply offends the values of many 
parents gary l bauer president of the conservative family 
research council and once an aide to reagan said thursday 
bauer said koops comments occasionally caused great chagrin 
among some at the white house although bauer said he never knew 
reagan to express any feeling that koop was out of line 
koop has been praised almost universally in the gay community 
for putting his personal beliefs aside and looking at aids as a 
public health problem 
he stood up for what he believed was the right thing to do in 
terms of health policy even if it wasnt the right thing to do in 
terms of politics said urvashi vaid a spokeswoman for the 
national gay and lesbian task force most victims of the fatal 
disease have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers 
dr mervyn silverman president of the american foundation for 
aids research said koops intergrity as a public health 
official was paramount 
despite his strong opposition to abortion koop recently won 
support from abortionrights groups when he declined to issue a 
report requested by the white house saying he could not find 
enough scientific evidence to determine whether abortion is 
psychologically harmful for women 
koop was also on the front line in the fight against smoking an 
area of activity for his predecessors since the first surgeon 
generals report on smoking in 1964 
he called for a smokefree society by the year 2000 
heightened awareness of the dangers of secondhand smoke and 
strengthened warning labels on cigarette packages 
koop is the nations 13th surgeon general a position that was 
created in 1870 as part of the merchant marine because the post 
has little statutory authority some presidents did not bother to 
fill the job others gave the title to the assistant secretary of 
health

naguib mahfouz 1988 nobel prize winner for 
literature declined police protection after a moslem 
fundamentalist leader called him an apostate and said he should be 
killed his daughter said thursday 
the moslem cleric or imam is omar abdelrahman the blind 
sheik who decreed to his followers that it was not a sin to murder 
president anwar sadat sadat was assassinated by moslem 
fundamentalists oct 6 1981 but abdelrahman was acquitted of 
murder charges 
mahfouzs eldest daughter om kalthoum said in a telephone 
interview that police had offered her father protection after the 
death call last month but that he declined it she added he had not 
changed his lifestyle in any way 
mahfouz the first arab to win the nobel prize for literature 
was not immediately available for comment 
abdelrahman who is under arrest after being charged with 
instigating an antigovernment demonstration in the southern town 
of fayoum said in an interview with the kuwaiti newpaper alanbaa 
april 13 that mahfouz had turned his back on islam and therefore 
should be killed under islamic laws 
abdelrahman also said mahfouz 77 should have been killed a 
long time ago after writing children of gebelawi which is 
banned in egypt because one of its characters resembles god 
the interview did not appear in egypt and had no immediate 
impact but on april 21 moussa sabry a columnist in the daily 
alakhbar newspaper warned security authorities that 
abdelrahmans threat was real 
let me tell you that the life of our great writer is 
threatened by assassination this is a public announcement that he 
can be killed sabry wrote what are the legal and security 
measures that should be taken in this case 
when an international uproar arose over the novel satanic 
verses by salman rushdie under death threats from iran for 
alleged blasphemy mahfouz told the associated press that freedom 
of expression should be protected at all costs 
he said he had not read rushdies book but that anyone who 
disagreed with its contents had the right to respond to it in 
newspapers or books he said irans death threat was wrong and only 
harmed the image of islam in the world 
mahfouz says he is a moslem although he does not observe 
religious practices diligently 
author of more than 40 novels and several collections of short 
stories mahfouz was the first arab to win the nobel prize for 
literature the writers health is very frail and he was unable to 
accept the award personally last december

oliver l north left on verdict day just as he 
arrived through the back door shoulders squared eyes fixed dead 
ahead no comment for public consumption but first there was a 
broad smile and a courtroom kiss for his wife 
she smiled too even as the federal jury of nine women three 
men had pronounced her husband both guilty and innocent convicting 
him on three felony counts acquitting him on nine others 
the jury rendered that verdict on its 12th day of 
deliberations without casting a single glance at the defendant 
the former vietnam war hero and marine lieutenant colonel charged 
with scheming outside of the law and white house order as the 
principal action officer in the irancontra affair 
north sat impassively as us district judge gerhard a gesell 
read the verdict including the findings of guilt falsifying and 
destroying documents accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and 
abetting the obstruction of congress then after both judge and 
jury filed solemnly from the room north strode to wife betsy and 
they embraced 
the couple the north defense team and their bodyguards 
departed from the rear of the building in a gray van their usual 
practice throughout the trial reporters were not allowed close 
enough to ask questions betsy waved at a small group of supporters 
hoisting placards and chanting encouragement but north did not 
turn their way 
ollie ollie ollie chanted the pronorth group their 
signs read oliver north american hero and baseball hot 
dogs apple pie and ollie north one member of the group bob 
goulder said north was doing something he belived in for a 
cause which probably not one in 10 people in america do 
at the main entrance to the courthouse chief trial prosecutor 
john keker himself a former vietnam hero declared col north 
has been convicted of three very serious charges the jury has 
spoken after a long and difficult trial and the principle that no 
man is above the law has been vindicated 
but rep dana rohrabacher rcalif a former white house aide 
for whom north campaigned last year said the jury had found north 
guilty of only cutting corners and not breaking the law 
rohrabacher and reps robert dornan rcalif and henry hyde 
rill had gone to the courtroom to lend support to north as the 
verdict was announced and met briefly with him afterward north 
was absolutely elated and his wife expressed a true sense of 
relief said rohrabacher 
hyde said i am sorry he was found guilty of anything if the 
president had been able to testify and former national security 
adviser john poindexter had been able to testify he would have 
had a fair trial 
i consider this a vindication i considered this a political 
trial from day one said rohrabacher george bush should end 
this travesty and give him a pardon 
a hundred reporters and dozens of camera crews were stationed at 
the front of the courthouse in hopes of catching north and other 
key players in the trial 
the first person to give that assemblage word of the outcome was 
dornan rcalif who got the verdict wrong proclaiming that 
north had been convicted of only two counts 
speaking as a personal friend and admirer of col north 
dornan said he didnt expect the conviction on the illegal 
acceptance of a gratuity a security gate would hold up on 
appeal 
if that one isnt overturned on appeal ill eat your 
microphones dornan said 
the outside worlds view of the verdict changed some 10 minutes 
later when several dozen reporters scrambled out of the courtroom 
itself many to do instantaneous standup reports for television 
some said our system of justice could not deal fairly if at 
all with this case keker said some even said that it 
couldnt be tried 
then after noting the three felony convictions and proclaiming 
vindication of the principle than no man stands above the law 
keker said thank you very much and walked away refusing all 
questions 
soon thereafter a scream of sirens announced the departure 
with an escort of us marshals of the jury they werent taking 
questions either

here are some of dr c everett koops 
accomplishments and controversies during his seven years as surgeon 
general 
in 1983 koop helped write regulations designed to protect 
handicapped infants by ensuring they be provided nourishment and 
care the regulations were later thrown out by the supreme court 
on may 20 1984 koop declared the nations no 1 health goal 
to be a smokefree society by the year 2000 
on march 25 1986 the surgeon general declared snuff and 
chewing tobacco to be a significant health risk that can be 
addictive and lead to cancer 
on aug 1 1986 koop put himself at odds with the white house 
and endorsed a proposed ban on cigarette advertising in magazines 
newspapers and other publications 
on oct 22 1986 koop issued a report on the aids epidemic in 
which he said use of condoms for safe sex was a key weapon in 
the fight against the spread of aids and supported sex education 
for children as early as the third grade 
in a may 1988 report the surgeon general declared nicotine to 
be addictive like heroin and cocaine providing new ammunition for 
antismoking forces 
in january 1989 koop declined to issue a report requested by 
the white house because he said there was insufficient scientific 
data to determine whether abortion harms women psychologically

a day after delivering a report critical of 
the performance of us high schools education secretary lauro 
cavazos faced sharp questioning from sen edward m kennedy about 
the bush administrations elimination of most federal literacy 
programs 
even before cavazos could deliver his opening statement to the 
senate labor and human resources education subcommittee kennedy a 
massachusetts democrat asked cavazos to explain why president bush 
has asked for money to fund only one major adult literacy program 
in his 1990 budget request 
we have to ask ourselves how much were really gaining if 
we are focusing on one program and yet cutting back on others 
said kennedy who heads the labor and human resources panel 
cavazos said his department was exercising a little bit of 
academic deregulation and giving the states more flexibility in 
using the available money 
bush has asked for 192 million in the 1990 education budget for 
adult literacy programs experts say there are 25 million to 30 
million functionally illiterate adults in the united states 
you raised the adult education state grant by 24 million but 
other programs are cut by 21 million kennedy said 
i cant look and read this budget and think that it does very 
much in terms of where the administrations commitments are because 
it basically is not even a current services program kennedy 
persisted in an exchange after cavazos delivered his prepared 
testimony 
we look at these projects as demonstration projects and 
thats why they are not contained in our budget request for 1990 
said d kay wright deputy assistant secretary for vocational and 
adult education 
we hope that after two years the states can take a look at 
some of these projects and decide that they want to do similar 
projects 
then the program is effectively eliminated countered 
kennedy 
i think that the effort has to come across from everybody 
it is not just a federal problem its a problem that really needs 
to be dealt with at every level said the secretary

a kremlin commission probing last months fatal 
clash between troops and protesters in soviet georgia found that 
three gas grenades exploded in the crowd but that the gas could not 
have killed anyone a government spokesman said thursday 
the findings conflicted with unequivocal statements from a 
georgian commission and top georgian officials that a chemical used 
when soviet troops charged proindependence protesters on april 9 
caused nerve damage and several deaths 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the 
kremlin panel identified one component of the gas as a chemical 
known in the west as cs an incapacitating agent used to break 
up crowds in many countries 
when this gas is used in the open air any fatality is ruled 
out gerasimov told a government news briefing 
preliminary findings from a georgian commission appointed days 
after the clash in the soviet republics capital of tbilisi held 
that many protesters suffered from poisoning by an unknown 
chemical substance with effects resembling a nerve toxin 
georgian communist party chief givi gumbaridze told foreign 
correspondents in tbilisi last week that some of the 20 deaths 
during the april 9 ethnic unrest were caused by gas 
almost 500 georgians have been treated for chemical poisoning 
and many are still hospitalized with symptoms affecting their 
nervous system vision respiration and internal organs the weekly 
moscow news reported 
the victims can only be helped by exact information about the 
formula of the chemical substance and its antidote which are still 
unknown to tbilisi doctors the weekly said in its latest 
editions 
five more young people have joined eight others who began a 
hunger strike on friday to demand that the military provide an 
antidote to the gas a georgian activist david nadiradze said 
thursday 
president mikhail s gorbachev in a speech last week to a 
plenary meeting of the communist partys policymaking central 
committee promised a thorough investigation of everything that 
happened in georgia 
the sixman kremlin panel consists of top officials of the kgb 
the georgian council of ministers and the soviet ministries of 
health defense and internal affairs its chairman is georgy s 
tarazevich president of the republic of byelorussia 
its investigation is meant to run parallel to work done by the 
georgian panel 
the 45member group based in georgia originally consisted mainly 
of government officials including georgian president zurab 
chkheidze who later resigned along with other republican leaders 
who took responsibility for the decision to send in government 
troops to disperse the protesters 
after many georgians complained that the panel could not be 
objective because officials were called upon to investigate their 
own actions the group was made offlimits to representatives of 
government agencies involved in the clash 
it is now considered an independent citizens group 
human rights activist andrei sakharov space scientist roald 
sagdeev and historian dmitry likhachev all members of a new 
national parliament have also been accepted as members the moscow 
news reported 
the georgian commission already has managed to disprove rumors 
that the bodies of some people who have been missing since the 
clash had been hidden in hospital morgues the moscow news said 
but the search for several people who have still not been accounted 
for continues it said

californias supreme court on thursday 
unanimously upheld all of proposition 103s longterm restrictions 
on insurance rates and practices but it punched a hole in a 20 
percent rate rollback and freeze 
the ruling by the conservativedominated court still was a 
serious blow to insurance companies who had predicted that 
proposition 103 would cost them 4 billion a year 
those costs may drop in the short run because of the courts 
weakening of the rate rollback the most dramatic immediate change 
proposed by proposition 103 but the provisions upheld by the 
justices are potentially much more sweeping in the long run 
they include a restriction on territorial ratesetting by auto 
insurers a 20 percent insurance discount for good drivers 
defined as those with no more than one moving violation in three 
years a requirement of advance state approval for insurance rate 
increases after this november and election instead of appointment 
of the state insurance commissioner starting next year 
until this november insurers will be allowed to increase rates 
without prior state approval but any amount that state insurance 
commissioner roxani gillespie rules to be excessive when measured 
against a standard of a fair rate of return will have to be 
refunded with interest 
the overall ruling is a major unprecedented victory for 
citizens consumers and democracy said harvey rosenfield the 
los angeles lawyer and consumer activist who drafted proposition 
103 and engineered its passage last november against heavily 
financed opposition 
insurers could ask the us supreme court to review their claims 
that the rate limitations and restrictions on nonrenewal of 
policies violate their property rights 
the industrys first response to the ruling was cautious 
there seems to be a lot of gray area in the decision said 
richard wiebe spokesman for the alliance of american insurers 
on first reading it appears that there are safeguards that would 
allow companies some relief from the rate rollbacks 
but clearly its a new day for insurance regulation in 
california and we intend to work with the insurance commissioner 
legislature and consumer groups 
insurance companies already have gone to the legislature to seek 
passage of a milder form of a nofault auto insurance plan that was 
one of four insurancerelated measures rejected by the voters last 
november 
insurers spent over 55 million in the election campaign and 
trial lawyers who backed a rateregulation measure that was more 
modest than proposition 103 spent over 16 million proposition 
103 whose backers included consumer advocate ralph nader had a 3 
million budget 
major insurance companies sued the day after the nov 8 election 
as written proposition 103 required auto property and 
liability insurance rates to be reduced 20 percent below november 
1987 levels and frozen until november 1989 unless an insurer could 
show a substantial threat of insolvency 
insurers said the exemption was too narrow to allow them a 
fair rate of return a constitutional standard set by the court 
in rentcontrol cases the courts opinion by justice alan 
broussard agreed rejecting arguments by defenders of the 
initiative that a recent surge in insurance rates justified a 
temporarily stricter standard 
the asserted rise in insurance rates rendering insurance 
unavailable or unaffordable to many is not a temporary problem it 
is a longterm chronic situation which will not be solved by 
compelling insurers to sell at less than a fair return for a 
year broussard said 
over the long term the state must permit insurers a fair 
return we do not perceive any shortterm conditions that would 
require depriving them of a fair return 
after this november proposition 103 requires an insurer to 
submit any rate increase in advance to the insurance commissioner 
who will decide if it is excessive inadequate or unfairly 
discriminatory the court left that provision intact 
the effect is to leave shortterm rate increases largely up to 
gillespie an appointee of gov george deukmejian and former 
insurance executive who has been critical of proposition 103 but 
has been active recently in enforcing some of its provisions 
backers of the measure predict that an elected insurance 
commissioner will take a tougher line on insurers

the man president bush has picked to negotiate 
trade treaties for the united states said thursday that 12 european 
governments must reform the way they subsidize their agricultural 
exports 
rufus h yerxa commented at senate confirmation hearings held on 
his nomination to become deputy us trade representative 
if confirmed by the senate finance committee yerza will be the 
chief us negotiator in geneva switzerland where about 100 
countries hope to complete trade agreements in the uruguay 
round of negotiations by the end of 1990 
agricultural exports will likely play a key role in the talks 
sen john c danforth rmo said he had spoken last week in 
brussels belgium with ray macsharry of ireland who is in charge 
of agriculture for the european commission which handles trade for 
its 12 member governments their european economic community is the 
main competitor of the united states in worldwide sales of farm 
products 
the 12 european governments subsidize agricultural exports 
through the communitys common agricultural policy the bush 
administration opposes the subsidies contending they put american 
exports at a competitive disadvantage on the world market 
the common agricultural policy is one of the most distorting 
if not the most distorting elements in agricultural trade yerxa 
said there will have to be a fundamental reform in it 
he said the united states had not yet seen what he called the 
color of the europeans money that is firm european bargaining 
proposals on farm export subsidies

a world conference on protecting the 
earths ozone layer adjourned abruptly thursday for a private 
meeting of leaders who disagree on how to help third world 
countries replace environmentally dangerous equipment 
earlier the conference agreed to safeguard company secrets on 
the production of ozonedepleting chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs and 
called for the elimination of cfcs by the end of the century 
cfcs are used in refrigerators air conditioners housing 
insulation food packaging and furniture and to clean metals and 
tiny computer components 
emissions of the chemicals are breaking down the ozone shield 
which filters out the suns ultraviolet rays increasing the risk 
of skin cancer eye diseases and hazards to marine and plant life 
scientists say 
developing countries argued they cannot afford to replace 
appliances they imported or were given in aid by industrial 
nations and the conference agreed a mechanism should be found to 
help the third world phase out such equipment 
but industrial nations objected to proposals to set up a world 
climate fund prefering to work through bilateral aid rather than 
relinquish direct control over the money they donate delegates 
said 
us delegate stephen seidel said an international fund could 
create a bureaucracy whose administration costs would divert money 
earmarked for aid britain japan and canada were among others 
opposing the fund 
mostafa k tolba head of the un environment program 
sponsoring the conference of more than 80 nations adjourned the 
plenum for private consultations to work for a consensus 
tolba summoned representatives from the united states the 
european economic community china mexico and from the group of 77 
developing countries 
an environment program spokesman said no announcement was 
expected until friday the last day of the fourday meeting 
the conference was reviewing the 1987 montreal protocol 
ratified by 36 countries which set out a timetable for slashing 
cfc production the conference resolved on tuesday to accelerate 
the timetable 
at a closeddoor session the corporate secrecy issue caused a 
fiery debate when the greenpeace environmentalist group demanded 
full disclosure of information submitted to the un group on 
production of the chemicals 
the conference adopted a useuropean economic community 
proposal to allow publication of total production figures but the 
environmental group cannot issue a breakdown of the figures by 
country and by the chemicals each produces said us delegation 
leader eileen claussen 
its a fair compromise said ms claussen who is deputy 
director of the environmental protection agency 
greenpeace delegate karen coulter said the secrecy could help 
countries hide the production of banned chemicals how is it that 
commercial confidentiality can override environmental concern 
she asked 
greenpeaces objections were supported by the soviet union 
norway and representatives of the third world countries the 
finnish news agency reported 
the resolutions adopted by concensus at the conference have no 
immediate legal standing they will be part of a summary report 
prepared for a meeting next year which will amend the montreal 
treaty

wisconsins congressional delegation 
introduced legislation thursday that would revise the terms of 
150yearold indian treaties to allow more sport fishing in the 
chippewa area of the state 
the bill adapts the treaties to todays world said sen 
robert kasten rwis 
many fear the dispute pitting northern wisconsin resort owners 
and sportsmen against the indians who have federal court approval 
to begin spear fishing before fishing season opens will turn 
violent 
kasten and three of the states congressmen said they were 
working with wisconsin gov tommy g thompson to restart stalled 
negotiations between the chippewas and the state 
a large part of what we are trying to do is get both parties 
back to the negotiating table said rep david obey dwis the 
issue is whether everyone can get along 
obey said he called every tribe in his district to tell them 
about the legislation and ask them to cease spearing he said the 
tribes are spearing more fish than they need to feed their families 
and should be willing to share with hookandline sportsmen 
kasten said he was concerned about possible confrontations 
between the indians and fishermen who say the chippewas are robbing 
the lakes of trophy size fish 
the dispute stems from a federal court decision two years ago 
that the chippewas under treaties negotiated in 1837 and 1842 
were guaranteed fishing rights in the territories they gave up to 
the government 
when the treaties were signed wisconsin was a wilderness 
said obey the court opinion that caused the problem was off 
base 
he and the others conceded that their proposed legislation may 
be difficult to push through congress 
the bill limits the chippewa tribes share of the fish from any 
wisconsin lake to 10 percent of the safe harvest level which means 
the tribes would be limited primarily to ceremonial spearing said 
the congressmen 
the legislation would allow the indians to go to court to seek 
compensation for the amount of fish they would no longer be allowed 
to spear state and federal governments would pay the costs

limoges and was executed by the nazis in march 1944 the yad vashem 
institution lists him among the righteous among the nations a 
title reserved for people who saved jews from the nazi holocaust

polish leader wojciech jaruzelski proposed 
thursday that parliament pass a blanket pardon for political 
offenses committed since the original agreements of august 1980 
that legalized solidarity 
gen jaruzelski the communist party chief made the 
conciliatory gesture toward the opposition in a speech opening a 
twoday party conference on plans for partially democratic 
elections to be held in june 
new agreements concluded april 5 made the independent union 
legal again after a sevenyear ban in exchange for opposition 
participation in the elections 
jaruzelski said thursday the arrangement was a step toward 
national harmony and declared 
we think it purposeful to file a bill on pardoning and 
committing to oblivion breaches of law that were politically 
motivated or related to strikes or protest actions after the august 
1980 agreements we hope this initiative will contribute to 
strengthening responsible democracy 
one of solidaritys main demands in negotiations for the april 5 
accords was an end to such penalties 
a union spokesman said it would have no immediate comment on 
jaruzelskis proposal 
jan bisztyga spokesman for the party central committee told 
reporters a bill to pardon political offenders would be introduced 
soon but that he could not provide copies 
in his speech jaruzelski also said the party is committed to 
political reform and recognizes that constructive realistic 
opposition is a natural consequence of democracy 
we are ahead of the major part of the opposition which seems 
to be taking a nap because it still sees us in the old socalled 
nonreformable edition he said 
jaruzelski said the april agreements were reached after a long 
and bumpy road the necessary time had to pass emotions had to 
ease and seeds of trust had to appear it is all still fragile but 
it is awakening hopes 
in any case we are treating the cause of national accord with 
utmost seriousness he said constructive realistic opposition 
is a natural consequence of broadening the democratic foundations 
of our state system 
under the agreements the opposition may contest 161 seats or 
35 percent of the total in the sejm the existing unicameral 
parliament a 100member senate is to be established chosen by 
fully democratic elections 
the sejm and senate together will form the national assembly 
which will elect a president the presidency is a new office and 
jaruzelski is expected to fill it

oliver north on thursday after a federal court jury convicted him 
on three counts and acquitted him on nine others in charges arising 
from the irancontra affair 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
todays verdict by the jury here in washington is a partial 
vindication for what has been for my family and me a very long and 
difficult process throughout this my family and i have been 
sustained by the support and the love and the kindness and the 
prayers of the american people without them and their love and 
the grace of god there is no way we could have endured the length 
of this ordeal 
certainly i hoped that this battle would be behind us by now 
but todays was not a complete victory after more than two and a 
half years and over 40 million of our taxpayers money spent on 
investigations congressional inquisitions and now a special 
prosecutor who has likened me to adolf hitler we now face many 
months and perhaps years of fighting the remaining charges 
nonetheless we are absolutely confident of the final outcome as a 
marine i was taught to fight and fight hard for as long as it 
takes to prevail we will continue this battle and with the support 
and prayers of the american people we will be fully vindicated

american engineers builders suppliers and 
development experts have an opportunity to earn some of the 
trillions of yen japan plans to pour into overseas economic aid 
us aid chief alan woods said thursday 
japan about to replace the united states as the worlds largest 
foreign aid donor is interested in making use of us expertise 
said woods head of the us agency for international development 
britain has already responded to the japanese desire for expert 
collaboration and the british have become procurement agents for 
the japanese aid agency throughout east africa he said 
japan plans to spend 50 billion on overseas economic aid in the 
next five years with the emphasis on building dams power 
stations roads railways and factories aid officials said 
american aid in recent years has shifted from such major capital 
projects to technical assistance they said 
foreign firms are already increasing their share of contracts in 
the japanese aid program but the us share is dropping strongly 
suggesting that the competitive environment has become more 
favorable but that potential america bidders are not widely aware 
of it an aid announcement said 
woods announced that aid is sponsoring conferences in san 
francisco on may 10ll and orlando fla on may 1516 to help 
american enterprises learn about opportunities in the japanese 
overseas development program officials from three japanese aid 
agencies will participate in both meetings the first such sessions 
ever held he said 
the japanese have only about 200 foreign aid specialists and 
appear eager to draw on the experience of more than 2000 americans 
working on aid programs woods said 
there is no formal agreement on collaboration between the two 
countries agencies woods said 
but foreign participation in japanesefinanced programs outside 
japan is governed by conditions different from those for japanese 
domestic projects where difficult negotiations were held last year 
to gain access for us contractors he added 
japanese aid has thus far chiefly been sent to other asian 
nations

retired army gen william c westmoreland 
urged congress on thursday to toughen the pentagons standards of 
accounting for missing american soldiers and give families more 
input into decisions to classify soldiers as dead or missing 
westmoreland who was us military commander in vietnam from 
1964 to 1968 said many families of the 2364 americans not 
accounted for since the vietnam war are plagued by the 
uncertainty of the fate of loved ones 
westmoreland and retired navy adm elmo r zumwalt commander of 
the us naval forces in vietnam from 1968 to 1970 endorsed 
legislation by rep john g rowland rconn to revamp the 
governments accounting system for missing soldiers 
rowland speaking at a news conference complained that all but 
one of the unaccountedfor americans in southeast asia have over 
the years had their official status changed from missing or 
prisoners of war to killed in action regardless of individual 
circumstances surrounding the disappearance 
our government has declared pows and mias as dead based solely 
on the passage of time this is wrong said rowland our 
interest is that we dont arbitrarily assume people are dead 
the missing service personnel act of 1989 would set up special 
threemember panels to investigate cases and prohibit 
killedinaction classifications based exclusively on the passage 
of time 
the bill would require that at least 50 years had passed or that 
no evidence exists that reasonably suggests that such a person is 
alive before classifying a soldier as dead in addition us 
officials would be required to attempt to search the area where the 
soldier was last seen and try to review records of the foreign 
government 
the measure would not automatically reverse classifications from 
dead to missing but families would be allowed to request a review 
by the board families also would have the right to challenge a 
classification in federal court 
there arent many ways we have to say thank you to the men and 
women who served in an unpopular war certainly this is the least 
we can do said rep lynn martin rill 
rep robert c smith rnh said the killedinaction 
classifications represent a strange inconsistency in government 
policy since the defense intelligence agency continues to actively 
investigate reports of missing soldiers 
lt col keith schneider said defense department officials had 
not seen the bill and would withhold comment 
several veterans groups supported the measure but the national 
league of families of american prisoners and missing in southeast 
asia criticized the legislation 
league spokeswoman betsy cox said while the current system has 
problems rowlands proposal could result in keeping many cases in 
limbo status

the jurys verdict against oliver north on 
thursday left supporters claiming he had been all but vindicated 
and detractors asserting that it reaffirmed the findings of the 
congressional irancontra committees that north displayed disdain 
for both law and constitution 
north was described by his defenders as absolutely elated 
that the jury had acquitted him guilty on nine counts convicting 
him on only three 
several members of congress all republicans called on 
president bush to quickly pardon the former marine corps lieutenant 
colonel 
former president reagan on whose watch north took the actions 
that resulted in the irancontra scandal and his trial by jury 
declined comment a spokesman said it would not be appropriate for 
reagan to do so because of the likelihood of further legal 
proceedings president bush also had no comment on the verdict 
sen robert c byrd dwva the senates president pro tem 
read off the three guilty verdicts on the chambers floor then 
congratulated the jury for its diligence 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii the chairman of the senate 
irancontra committee issued a statement quoting the panels 
finding that north and the others involved in the irancontra 
affair showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system of 
government 
the report concluded that they ran a government outside the 
government they conducted a secret foreign policy and concealed it 
through a concerted campaign of dishonesty and deception and when 
the affair began to unravel they attempted to cover it up with 
their deeds 
the verdict issued today reaffirms the conclusions of the 
committee inouye said 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house irancontra 
committee said he was neither elated nor disappointed at the 
verdict col north had a fair trial the system has worked 
he said 
i have had a good deal of sympathy for col north and the 
position he was in hamilton added the fact that col north 
was in a difficult position does not absolve him of his 
responsibility but it may go toward mitigation of his punishment 
we certainly didnt find out all the truth in the irancontra 
hearings hamilton said well be learning bits and pieces 
about irancontra for years to come and after the statute of 
limitations runs out well probably find more 
sen warren rudman rnh vice chairman of the senate panel 
said he believed justice was served in the north verdict 
north had to pay a price for his zealotry i found him a 
very tragic figure he did some things that in america today you 
have to be held accountable for 
but sen orrin hatch rutah who used his position as a member 
of the irancontra panel to defend president reagan and north 
sharply disagreed 
there have been nine acquittals he said if you look at 
this objectively oliver north has been largely acquitted 
the jury did not think he was as guilty as did the many 
members of congress who have been ready to hang him hatch said 
hatch added i think george bush should pardon him the 
presidents problem is that if he does there will be screaming and 
shouting by the same partisans 
rep henry hyde rill who also served on the irancontra 
committee said he felt sorrow disappointment with the 
verdict but not surprise 
im not sure oliver north got a fair trial the jury claimed 
they never had heard of irancontra but it had consumed all of the 
media in washington i wonder if it was jury of his peers hyde 
said 
the illinois republican said if reagan the late cia director 
bill casey and former national security adviser john poindexter had 
been available to assist north it would have been of great 
help 
colonel north was left twisting in the wind by an 
administration he served with all his heart and soul said hyde 
who believes that reagan should have pardoned north or testified in 
his behalf 
rep dante fascell dfla a member of the irancontra 
committee told reporters i have said from the beginning that 
col north was acting on orders expressed or implied an operation 
of the magnitude of the irancontra affair is not one that can be 
run solely by one lieutenant colonel out of the basement of the 
white house without the knowledge of his superiors 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine a former judge 
said only that i respect the jurys verdict in the north case 
outside the federal courthouse here rep robert dornan 
rcalif an ardent north supporter said the former marines wife 
betsy was all smiles at the verdict 
he said north smiled as the verdict came in then turned to kiss 
his wife 
dornan said north and his wife looked like 900 pounds of a 
1200pound weight had been lifted from their backs 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif a former white house aide for 
whom north campaigned last year described the defendant as 
absolutely elated 
he said that as far as he was concerned the jury found north 
guilty of only cutting corners and not breaking the law 
i think george bush should end this travesty and give him a 
pardon said rohrabacher 
john w keker the lead prosecutor in the case told reporters 
north was convicted of three very serious felony charges 
the principle that no man is above the law has been 
vindicated said keker who refused to answer questions about the 
verdict 
in a statement independent counsel lawrence walsh said it 
has been a wellconducted hardfought trial the rule of law has 
been discharged 
but richard a viguerie chiarman of the united conservatives of 
america said oliver north deserves a medal not a prison 
sentence he predicted an avalanche of conservative outcry for 
president bush to pardon ollie 
but arthur j kropp of the liberal people for the american way 
said the central lession of the irancontra episode is that 
governmental deception and excessive secrecy are invitations to 
scandal 
i hope the events of the past few weeks will lay to rest the 
question of whether oliver north is a national hero

the risk of serious safety lapses at a 
sacramento calif nuclear plant is increasing with the approach 
of a local referendum on whether to close the troubled plant a 
city utility official told a senate panel on thursday 
the potential for employees to be pressured to keep the plant 
operating even during adverse circumstances is high said ed 
smeloff a member of the board of directors of the sacramento 
municipal utility district owner of the rancho seco plant 
residents in the utility district are scheduled to vote june 6 
on whether the plant should be closed permanently 
smeloffs remarks were disputed in later testimony by lando w 
zech jr chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission which has 
spent more time over the last three years inspecting rancho seco 
than any of the 109 other us nuclear reactors 
the stressful environment for rancho seco workers has not 
resulted in unsafe nuclear plant operations and the commission 
concludes that rancho seco has been and can continue to be 
operated safely zech told a senate environment and public works 
subcomittee that is investigating nrc oversight of rancho seco 
the plant has come under increased scrutiny since an 
industrysponsored safety group the institute of nuclear power 
operations issued a report april 4 that sharply criticized the 
plants performance record and the utility districts management 
the institutes president zack t pate told the subcommittee 
his group is still concerned about the terms of the june 
referendum the utility agreed last summer that if it failed during 
an 18month trial period starting last june to operate at a 
minimum of 40 percent of capacity it would shut permanently 
smeloff said that since last december the plant has operated at 
less than 40 percent of capacity the average performance rating 
for all us nuclear plants is about 60 percent 
pate said pressure to meet the 40 percent target could cause 
some plant workers to discard normal caution in order to save the 
plant and thus their jobs

the health care system in rural america will 
crumble if a medicare reimbursement system that has caused the 
slow starvation of rural hospitals isnt quickly reversed sen 
tom harkin told a senate panel thursday 
members of the senate finance committee agreed medicares system 
for reimbursing urban hospitals at a higher rate than their rural 
counterparts is unfair and largely responsible for putting rural 
hospitals on frail financial footing 
health and human services secretary louis w sullivan 
meanwhile has recommended rural and large urban hospitals receive 
greater medicare payment increases next fiscal year than hospitals 
in urban areas with populations below one million 
sullivan said he recognizes the need to make medicares 
payment system fairer under his plan inflationbased increases 
would be greatest for rural hospitals followed by a slighter 
increase for large urban hospitals and the smallest increase for 
other urban hospitals 
he also suggests more rural hospitals be allowed to qualify as 
sole community hospitals which would allow them to receive 
higher medicare payments 
a senate committee staff member called the proposal 
encouraging but modest and no replacement for needed 
legislation federal health care officials said the 
recommendations would not save deeply troubled hospitals but would 
help equalize profit margins between rural and urban hospitals 
since 1980 206 rural hospitals nationwide have closed and 
another 500 are in serious financial trouble said harkin diowa 
a member of the senate rural health caucus 
this is a critically important issue said majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine every american ought to have access to 
medical care regardless of where we live 
minority leader bob dole and finance committee chairman lloyd 
bentsen dtexas have introduced legislation that calls for 
phasing in a uniform medicare reimbursement rate beginning in 1991 
if we dont act quickly to change medicares prospective 
payment system the health care system in rural america will 
crumble harkin said if that happens we will be forced not 
very long from now to take drastic measures with a drastic price 
tag to rebuild it 
under the prospective payment system hospitals are reimbursed 
for the average costs of their elderly medicare patients and not on 
actual costs the system enacted by congress in 1983 has meant 
rural hospitals are reimbursed by as much as 40 percent less than 
urban hospitals according to testimony 
the prospective payment system had assumed rural hospitals would 
have lower average costs than city hospitals 
we made a wrong calculation said sen david pryor dark 
who called on congress to change the formula 
pryor said 83 percent of hospitals losing money are rural 
hospitals dole argued rural hospitals are vital to a communitys 
very survival 
many rural occupations are hazardous farming mining and 
timber are among the most dangerous in the nation harkin said 
across the country rural areas show higher rates of maternal and 
infant mortality chronic illness and disability and higher 
morbidity related to diabetes cancer high blood pressure heart 
disease stroke and lung disease than urban areas

the architect of the bush administrations 
third world debt plan urged mexico and us commercial banks on 
thursday to speed up their talks on reducing mexicos debt burden 
and implied that both sides would have to shift their positions 
we are going to press all parties to move quickly david 
c mulford treasury undersecretarydesignate for international 
affairs told the senate finance committee 
asked by sen bill bradley dnj whether the banks holding 
mexicos debt should be more willing to bend he said i have no 
doubt the position taken by the banks is their first visible 
negotiating position 
however he added it takes two to tango in that case and 
said mexico should make proposals that are seen as realistic 
mulford is the chief architect of president bushs new 
initiative to relieve the crushing 12 trillion debt burden on 
developing countries particularly in latin america 
bushs treasury secretary nicholas f brady is calling on 
banks assisted by the world bank and international monetary fund 
to forgive a portion of the debt a shift from the reagan 
administrations policy of adamantly opposing any broadbased debt 
reduction plan 
as one of the first tests of the new strategy representatives 
of large banks and mexico have been meeting in new york to discuss 
mexicos proposal for about 4 billion in relief either through 
reduced interest rates or further loans 
the finance committee recommended that the full senate approve 
the nominations of mulford and two other top treasury department 
officials deputy secretarydesignate john e robson who would be 
the departments no 2 official and robert r glauber nominated 
to be undersecretary for finance glauber and mulford would be 
considered the no 3 and no 4 officials in the department 
robson was formerly dean of the business school at emory 
university in atlanta and before that president and chief 
executive officer of the pharmaceutical firm gd searle amp co in 
skokie ill 
glauber a professor at the harvard business school has been 
serving as a consultant to the treasury department since october 
and is one of the main authors of bushs savings and loan bailout 
earlier he was staff director of president reagans task force to

a yugoslav alleged to be a major in 
his countrys secret police was convicted thursday of trying to 
murder a dissident emigre and sentenced to 15 years in prison 
vinklo sindicic pleaded innocent to the charge of trying to 
murder nikola stedul with a silenced pistol outside steduls home 
in scotland and denied the prosecutions allegations that he was 
in the secret police stedul survived wounds to the head and body 
a high court jury in dunfermline found sindicic guilty after an 
11day trial 
lord allanbridge the presiding judge said in passing sentence 
the 46yearold defendant made a callous calculated and 
carefully planned attempt to murder stedul 
stedul 51 left yugoslavia as a young man to avoid military 
service and has lived in scotland for 14 years he is president of 
the croatian movement for statehood which seeks independence for 
croatia one of communist yugoslavias six republics 
he told the court he was certain the shooting last oct 20 was 
ordered by yugoslav authorities for political reasons 
sindicic said he was making telephone calls to yugoslavia at the 
time of the shooting in kirkcaldy just north of edinburgh a 
neighbor of the victim noted the license plate number of the car 
from which the shots were fired and it was traced to sindicic 
after the verdict stedul said i think this trial has proven 
beyond any doubt that yugoslavia is involved in state terrorism 
and i think this is probably more importart than todays 
conviction 
he claimed sindicic was involved in murders in other countries 
and that yugoslav agents had killed 70 people in foreign countries 
since 1969 
stedul whose wife and two daughters were with him said he felt 
a little bit safer with sindicic in jail but i dont believe 
we will ever lead a normal life 
croatian exiles have reported several attacks in recent years in 
europe and australia 
croat leader branko jelic survived a bombing in west berlin and 
josip senic leader of the croatian revolutionary brotherhood was

scandals ii has become the second abc 
special in a week to be dropped for lack of commercial interest 
but nbc said thursday a delay of the tv movie the prize 
pulitzer was not a victim of advertiser angst 
pressure groups responding to this seasons plethora of 
realitybased programs created in response to last summers 
writers strike have caused advertisers to think twice before 
associating themselves with stories of devil worship brutal crime 
and sex scandal 
both scandals ii and last weeks crimes of passion ii 
also pulled for lack of advertisers were sequels to specials that 
had racked up decent ratings if not critical acclaim earlier this 
season 
when abc tried to sell the second batch in a lowrated saturday 
time period this month no advertisers wanted to buy time 
usa today reported thursday that nbc had also dropped the 
prize pulitzer a tv movie based on roxanne pulitzers 
sensationalistic biography for similar reasons but nbc spokesman 
curt block denied the report 
the decision to put off the prize pulitzer until next season 
was made in january and is unrelated to any bailout of advertisers 
block said 
it is not in response to crimes of passion and scandals 
and these things that we made this move he said rolling over 
delaying to the next season is something all the networks do all 
of the time 
the delay of the prize pulitzer was announced in a march 22 
news release that also mentioned a perry mason movie and two other 
madefortv films that were being delayed until next season block 
said 
in a statement on the scandals ii move abc entertainment 
president robert iger said the network was considering the 
appropriate role for realitybased programming on our schedule in 
the interim we will consider each program on a casebycase basis 
crimes of passion ii was replaced by two halfhour comedy 
pilots that wound up in the bottom five in the nielsens a onehour 
drama will likely replace scandals ii this saturday said abc 
spokesman jim brochu in los angeles 
the first scandals program was one of several factbased 
shows created after last years strike by scriptwriters such 
realitybased programming was not subject to the writers guild 
of america contract and provided a stopgap until regular 
programming could resume 
nbcs unsolved mysteries enjoys continued healthy ratings 
so did a geraldo rivera special about satan worship which aired on 
nbc though it was attacked for lurid content nbc said that 
despite high ratings the network lost money on the special because 
of advertiser pullout 
in recent weeks advertisers have pulled commercials from nbcs 
saturday night live and nightingales and have expressed 
concern about the fox broadcasting cos married with 
children though its commercial time was sold out for the rest of 
the season 
snl was criticized for a sketch that involved repeated use of 
the word penis nightingales has been blasted by nursing 
groups for its cheesecake depictions of the nursing profession 
married with children is a decidedly raunchy 
counterpunch to sitcoms such as the cosby show it is foxs 
highestrated show next to americas most wanted which asks 
viewers to help solve reenacted reallife crimes

the nations highest ranking union official says 
that under new laws labor unions in the soviet union will have the 
right to strike to back up their demands 
stepan a shalaev chairman of the central council of trade 
unions made it clear however that the council does not envision 
strikes becoming common 
the decision to stop work at an enterprise this is an 
extreme measure to be taken only in extreme circumstances he 
said in an interview published wednesday the labor newspaper trud 
he said that unions must have the right to stop work at 
enterprises in organizations and institutions as a means of 
pressure on the administration for speeding up the resolution of 
labor disputes 
new regulations are included in a draft law published saturday 
and will be discussed by the unions for the next three months 
shalaev said the supreme soviet parliament will have to approve 
the legislation 
shalaev said unions will be free of government interference in 
organization and financial activity and local union officials will 
be independent of the administration of the factory or office where 
they work 
workers must be protected from losing their jobs because of 
union activity he added 
the laws are aimed at awakening the unions from decades of quiet 
subservience to the communist party and government the legislation 
granting unions a limited right to strike appears to be an effort 
to keep labor unrest from reaching the point that led to formation 
in poland of the solidarity free trade union federation 
labor unrest has spread in certain industries notably mining 
as president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms take hold and 
greater openness encourages soviets to speak out on issues 
affecting them 
soviet unions are not now permitted to strike by law and 
instead are quiet partners with management and the communist party 
in communist ideology strikes are viewed as a western phenomenon 
arising from managements exploitation of workers 
soviet unions traditionally have done nothing to advance 
employees wage and work condition demands but busied themselves 
instead with building and organizing housing for union members 
operating vacation facilities for members and the like the law 
gives unions wider rights over distribution of housing and other 
local issues such as ecological protection shalaev said

oliver north lost his pension as a retired 
marine officer when he was convicted thursday and he wont get it 
back unless the verdict is overturned on appeal a pentagon 
spokeswoman said 
north who retired as a lieutenant colonel in the marine corps 
with 20 years of activeduty service has been drawing an annual 
military pension of roughly 23100 since leaving the corps almost 
exactly a year ago 
at the time of his retirement north said he was leaving the 
service in order to better prepare his defense against charges of 
misconduct stemming from the irancontra affair 
on thursday the former national security council aide was 
convicted on three felony counts and cleared of nine others the 
jury found north guilty of shredding documents accepting an 
illegal gratuity and one count of aiding and abetting in an 
obstruction of congress 
north had been receiving his pension since he retired said army 
lt col linda dumoulin a pentagon spokeswoman 
but once the conviction becomes legally effective when the 
secretary of the navy is formally notified of it and the paperwork 
is completed north will lose his pension she said 
once the conviction goes into effect whatever time that is 
he loses his retired pay i know hes been convicted but i dont 
know exactly what time it takes effect whether its today or 
tomorrow or whatever she said 
if north wins on appeal he will get the pension back and will 
be given pay retroactively she said 
under federal law a retired officers pension is not 
jeopardized by just any felony conviction rather it depends upon 
the nature of the specific charge 
and according to lt col fred peck a marine corps spokesman 
only one of the charges on which north was convicted can result in 
loss of his pension the charge of destroying nsc records 
the conviction on that count requires the forfeiture by north 
of his office in other words his status as a retired lieutenant 
colonel in the marine corps peck said and that means you lose 
the pension 
under normal procedures peck said the secretary of the navy 
would issue an order directing revocation of norths pension once 
hes formally advised of the conviction 
monthly pension payments will then be withheld pending the 
results of any appeal should north succeed with an appeal he 
would then be entitled to restoration of his pension and back pay

vietnams foreign minister was quoted 
thursday as saying his country erred when it did not immediately 
condemn the communist khmer rouge which killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians in 19751978 
despite the mistake nguyen co thach said in an interview in the 
bangkok post vietnam corrected itself when it invaded cambodia in 
late 1978 and ousted the khmer rouge government 
thach spoke in bangkok wednesday before returning to hanoi the 
newspaper said 
vietnams communists helped form the cambodian communist party 
and gave military aid and direction to the khmer rouge whose 
insurgents won a fiveyear civil war and overthrew the usbacked 
lon nol government in april 1975 
over the next three years and eight months the khmer rouge 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and 
slave labor camps in its attempt to fashion an agrarian society 
along communist lines 
after thach condemned the crimes of the khmer rouge led by pol 
pot the interviewer said but the vietnamese did not condemn pol 
pot before 
yes it is our mistake thach was quoted as saying but we 
have corrected our mistake by military means 
vietnam did nothing until 1978 when it invaded cambodia 
following border attacks in which the khmer rouge killed thousands 
of vietnamese villagers 
and now what is the position of the western countries 
thach was quoted as saying they condemn them only by words not 
by deeds and when we condemn them by force they condemn vietnam 
so it is a pity 
some asian and western nations say the khmer rouge must be part 
of a future coalition government because it might otherwise try to 
take power by military means some reports have said the guerrillas 
have stocked up arms for an allout offensive after vietnam 
completes its promised troop withdrawal in september 
hun sen premier of the vietnameseinstalled government in 
cambodia tried to rule out any future role for the khmer rouge at 
this weeks talks in indonesia with resistance leaders prince 
norodom sihanouk and son sann 
the two noncommunist leaders are allied with the khmer rouge in 
the resistance coalition they say they hate the khmer rouge but 
need its 30000 to 40000 guerrillas 
in washington the united states praised the progress made in 
the latest round of talks in jakarta indonesia but said vietnam 
must pull its troops out for any agreement to work 
we believe the concessions discussed can help achieve a 
comprehensive and durable settlement to bring peace and stability 
to the cambodian people said state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
the key remains vietnams total withdrawal hanoi should meet 
its september deadline without preconditions and under 
internationally acceptable verification ms tutwiler said 
thach also welcomed the results of the talks in indonesia 
now is is clear they have made some progress to have 
appropriate reconciliation formula and mechanism on the basis of 
the reality in kampuchea cambodia he was quoted as saying i 
think it is a good direction 
the state department reaffirmed its views that once the 
vietnamese withdraw prince sihanouks role as a leader of an 
interim coalition preceding elections remains essential 
that comment appeared a response to reports that sihanouk told 
hun sen he would consider striking a separate deal with him if no 
agreement is reached on inclusion of the chinesebacked khmer rouge 
in an interim government

a woman went to federal appeals court thursday to 
fight demolition of her rustic cape cod dunes cottage that she 
claims is a historical relic capping a legal battle with literary 
overtones that began in 1967 
grace e bessay says her provincetown shack is one of a cluster 
of primitive beach cabins that for a century have been used as 
creative retreats by artists poets writers and celebrated 
bohemians including jack kerouac and eugene oneill 
the massachusetts historical commission has recommended that 
miss bessays shack on cape cod national seashore and 17 others 
belong on the national register of historic places 
the national park service which overseas the national seashore 
says it has identified shacks visited by notable artists but miss 
bessays cottage wasnt among them 
it says cottages frequented by such literary lights as oneill 
mabel dodge and edmund wilson are no longer standing and there is 
no proof that the likes of ee cummings kerouac and norman mailer 
spent time in the rickety buildings that still cling to the 
isolated dunes 
the governments lawyer says the case before the us circuit 
court of appeals turns not on its literary merits but on arcane 
matters of squatters rights the definition of a dwelling and 
tangled questions of titles 
the government condemned the shack in 1967 miss bessay says 
illegally but lawsuits prevented its demolition most neighbors 
meanwhile have given up and many reached agreements that will 
allow their cottages to be demolished after their deaths she said 
miss bessays is the oldest of the dune shack cases still 
pending in federal court according to one of her lawyers william 
p homans who said at least one of the original judges has died 
miss bessay who winters in cambridge says she is in her 
mid60s but wont be specific i have aged i must say by all 
this litigation she said some days i feel like im 110 
she said this legal battle and an earlier unsuccessful fight to 
keep two other dune cottages in truro have consumed about half 
of my life one way or another but i am a preservationist and a 
conservationist god help me 
the governments attorney david shilton argued that miss 
bessay does not have clear title to her property which she 
inherited from a friend in 1981 
furthermore he said the shack does not have modern 
electricity sewage lines or running water that would qualify it as 
the type of home that congress intended to preserve when it created 
the national seashore in 1961 
miss bessay said that is exactly why artists and naturelovers 
like it 
i dont want a generator banging away and making smells of 
gasoline she said living in a dune shack she said means 
getting your water by hand pumps which is a pleasure it isnt a 
burden its a pleasure and kerosene lamps for light that is also 
a pleasure 
if i were an amish person or a menonnite everyone would think 
it was wonderful she said and it is

president bush said thursday the world will 
be looking to see if there is government fraud in panamas 
elections sunday but he declined to say if he would reconsider 
relinquishing control of the panama canal should the elections not 
be free and fair 
the senate voted 1000 to approve a resolution condemning any 
attempts by gen manuel antonio noriega to manipulate the election 
process and insisting that the noriega regime conduct the 
election in a free and fair manner 
bush at a white house news conference with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney called on the panamanian people to do what 
they can to pressure noriega and his powerful military forces to 
hold fair elections 
noriega is not a candidate in sundays election but has an ally 
running for president and is seen as the countrys de facto ruler 
bush declined to answer directly when asked about a comment by 
house republican whip newt gingrich that americans will not 
tolerate turning over the canal to a noriega regime 
the united states has signed a treaty under which the 
uscontrolled canal will come under panamas jurisdiction at the 
end of the cetury 
bush said my view on that is to warn panama that the world 
will be looking at them not just the united states in terms of 
these elections deciding what to do if the elections are 
fraudulent calling on them for free and fair elections 
as to what moves he might have in mind to follow up the 
rhetorical attacks he has been making on noriega and the panamanian 
electoral process bush said 
there will be international observers there and then well 
cross whatever hypothetical bridge we may have to cross later on 
but this does give me an opportunity to say that i have been 
very disturbed by the reports that the election will be less than 
free and less that fair and less than open 
i simply want to encourage the people in panama to do 
everything they can to guarantee free and fair elections and what 
pressures they can bring to bear on mr noriega i dont know 
his call appeared to be a subtle urging to panamanian opposition 
forces to reinvigorate the energetic antinoriega protests that 
were prevalent in panama last year 
in the senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the 
united states cannot much longer tolerate noriegas corrupt 
reckless and repressive rule in panama 
we cannot much longer permit vital us interests including 
the panama canal and the us southern command to remain squarely 
in noriegas gunsights dole said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the resolution puts the 
senate strongly on record as demanding an end to the continuing 
trauma of gen noriegas rule of repression 
the senate resolution also called on bush to report to congress 
on the fairness of the elections and to consult with congress on 
the future course of action for united states foreign policy in 
panama 
one administration official noted that since the street 
demonstrations have died down it is more difficult for the united 
states to spur internal momentum to remove noriega 
gingrich suggested after he and a group of republican 
congressional leaders met with bush on thursday morning that 
continued domination of panama by noriega could jeopardize the 1979 
treaties under which the united states agreed to turn over the 
canal to panamanian control in 1999 
administration officials have indicated however that treading 
such ground is a risky area and one that is not high among the 
options the administration is considering 
us credibility particularly in latin america would be 
seriously damaged if the government backed out of the treaty 
officials have said 
bush and his advisers have been weighing a series of options for 
what policy to employ toward panama after a fraudulent election 
they have declined to say what they are looking at only that 
all options are being considered including involving us allies 
in isolating noriega 
the united states has a substantial military force based in 
panama 
bush this week is sending a team of observers to represent his 
administration at sundays elections 
it was not known how the observers will be received by noriega 
who has sought to limit the number of private observers allowed in 
for the election

the verdict in oliver l norths irancontra 
trial gave both sides credible claims to partial victory in the 
grueling battle for the jurys votes 
you cant say at this juncture that either side walked away 
with their theory intact said washington attorney lawrence 
barcella 
although north stands convicted of three felony charges the 
jury acquitted him of all the charges that he lied to congress 
including an allegation that he falsely answered lawmakers 
questions during a facetoface meeting 
there is something there for everyone said washington 
attorney richard venveniste a former watergate prosecutor 
throughout the case prosecutors for independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh argued that norths lies to congress cut to the 
heart of the democratic process by subverting the governments 
reliance on truth 
but jurors cleared the former presidential aide of these 
charges accepting norths denials that he helped prepare false 
statements jurors also apparently accepted norths explanation 
that when he did participate in fabrications it was on orders from 
superiors 
the jurys verdict on these counts was the worst defeat for 
walsh whose office has spent 16 million investigating and 
prosecuting north and the other irancontra defendants 
after dropping charges that north conspired to illegally divert 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels walsh was 
left with a case that north lied cheated and stole money 
benveniste noted that north was cleared of lies to congress 
that allegedly took place while the contra resupply operation was 
still secret but convicted him of destroying documents and aiding 
and abetting obstruction of a congressional inquiry once the affair 
was publicly known 
i think perhaps they drew a distinction between the potential 
for jeopardizing lives and assets while the mission was still 
secret and what occurred after public revelations benveniste 
said 
north himself appeared quite elated by the jurys verdicts 
moments after it was announced in court he gave his wife betsy a 
broad smile before kissing her 
later the retired marine lieutenant colonel called the verdict 
a partial vindiction and vowed in his soldierly way to fight 
for as long as it takes to prevail 
the jurys decision that north illegally destroyed national 
security council documents and aided and abetted the obstruction of 
the first congressional inquiry into the irancontra affair was a 
vindication for the prosecution 
lead prosecutor john keker noting that north stood convicted 
of three serious felony charges insisted the result showed that 
the principle that no man is above the law has been vindicated 
nevertheless the jury rejected the prosecution notion that 
north was a thief acquitting him of a charge that he converted 
4300 worth of travelers checks given to him by contra leaders to 
his personal use 
it did find that north illegally accepted a gratuity when he let 
arms dealer richard v secord build a security system outside his 
suburban virginia home 
norths admission that he fabricated proof that he had paid for 
the security system probably showed to the jury that he understood 
what he had done was wrong 
testimony by former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane about norths alleged role in the preparation of written 
responses to inquiries from various house committees was equivocal 
at best 
north told jurors he wanted to invoke executive privilege and 
refuse to answer one query 
in another case he said he edited a letter but didnt have any 
authority to make any substantive changes 
north admitted he lied to members of the house intelligence 
committee on aug 6 1986 but told jurors that he only attended the 
meeting at the insistence of his boss thennational security john 
poindexter 
you cant really tell from the verdict whether they rejected 
the authorization defense or not barcella said it appears to 
be a very factbound decision 
the jury appeared to reject the authorization defense when it 
convicted north of aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress 
in november 1986 when a false chronology of the usiran 
armsforhostages deals was prepared for lawmakers 
one could hardly say this was a jury that had it in for ollie 
north benveniste said

the us forest service will propose in 
upcoming talks that its controversial plan for preserving spotted 
owl habitat in the northwest be implemented while the bird is under 
consideration for listing as a threatened species a top agency 
official said thursday 
the plan has been widely criticized by environmentalists who 
say it is inadequate to ensure the survival of the owl and the 
timber industry which believes it locks up too much of the forests 
to logging 
a federal judge in seattle has banned sales involving nearly 1 
billion board feet of ancient timber in the northwests national 
forests while he considers a court challenge to the forest 
services plan 
in related developments thursday the forest service said it has 
identified potential sales involving roughly 280 million board feet 
of timber that could be substituted for sales currently enjoined 
the sales would involve so called thinning operations with 
trees in the 50yearold to 70yearold range some of the sales 
could be offered by late summer 
and rep norm dicks dwash said efforts are underway to bring 
together the oregon and washington congressional delegations to 
discuss the spotted owl situation 
george leonard associate chief of the forest service said in 
an interview that implementation of his agencys plan to protect 
spotted owl habitat will allow us to get on to some semblance of 
a timber sale program 
we want to get the fish and wildlife service to agree that our 
spotted owl habitat plan could be used for a couple of years 
the agencys plan would set aside between 1000 and 2700 acres 
for each of the estimated 2000 breeding pairs of spotted owls in 
the region 
the fish and wildlife service proposed last week that the owl 
thought to live almost exclusively in the oldgrowth forests of 
washington oregon and northern california should be listed as a 
threatened species under the endangered species act 
under the act the fish and wildlife service has up to two years 
to decide whether the owl should officially be listed and to 
develop management plans to protect it 
leonard said during those two years implementation of the 
forest services owl plan would allow us to follow through on the 
sales program we have planned and we think it ensures the 
viability of the owl 
the forest service bureau of land management and the national 
park service has requested a conference with the fish and 
wildlife service to discuss the shortterm impact of the proposed 
listing of the bird 
leonard said secretary of interior manuel lujan and secretary of 
agriculture clayton yeutter also will meet next week to discuss the 
spotted owl the forest service is part of the agriculture 
department and the bureau of land management part of the interior 
department 
environmentalists said they were disappointed with the 
forest services decision to push its plan 
its odd that the agency remains entrenched around a plan that 
has been widely discredited said jay watson who handles 
national forest issues for the wilderness society it seemed like 
we were moving away from that type of statement and starting 
afresh 
leonard warned that if logging were banned in all spotted owl 
habitat timber sales in the national forests of the northwest 
would be cut by about half in the short term and about onethird 
over the long term 
in addition leonard said the domestic supply of softwood lumber 
would be diminished by between 10 and 15 percent

one of two indian activists charged in 
the takeover of a newspaper last year pleaded guilty to 14 counts 
of seconddegree kidnapping and was sentenced to six years in 
prison thursday 
timothy jacobs 20 had faced up to 420 years in prison on 14 
counts of firstdegree kidnapping before he agreed to a plea 
bargain with robeson county district attorney robert townsend 
there have been attempts by some to portray timothy jacobs as 
the victim in this case townsend said but i dont want anyone 
in this courtroom to leave today thinking that the hostages and

of him is he may be trying to change from last year i hope thats 
true 
he wants to get on with his life and do something with 
himself said his mother eleanor jacobs after the court

a proposal by the house ways and means 
committee to discourage corporate takeovers helped trigger the 
record stock market crash of october 1987 concludes a study 
released thursday by the securities and exchange commission 
the committee chaired by rep dan rostenkowski dill 
approved a bill imposing a tax on takeovers on oct 15 1987 just 
four days before the record 508point decline in the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks 
the bill which would have limited the deductibility of debt 
used in takeovers has long been mentioned as one among many 
factors contributing to the crash 
however the study conducted by the secs office of economic 
analysis said the legislation was a fundamental economic event 
causing a 10 percent drop in the market from oct 1416 a decline 
that in turn probably triggered the oct 19 crash 
other factors that have been cited as causing the crash have 
been rising interest rates a dispute between the united states and 
west germany over the value of the dollar the us trade and 
budget deficit 
in support of their thesis sec researchers mark l mitchell and 
jeffry m netter say the market as measured by the standard and 
poors 500 index dropped 295 percent on oct 14 the day after word 
of the proposed legislation was released and 516 percent on oct 
16 the day after the committee passed the bill 
the market jumped 493 percent on oct 29 and 287 percent on 
oct 30 after it was reported that the legislation would be changed 
the study said traders known as risk arbitragers who speculate 
in stocks of companies targeted for takeover reacted negatively to 
news of the bills progress and positively to news of fading 
congressional support for the measure

former president jimmy carter said thursday the 
news media have shown an absence of courage by failing to 
assert press rights in restrictive nations such as south africa 
whenever an oppressive government like the one in south africa 
attempts to suppress the world press as they have in the past the 
press has been too dormant too timid i hesitate to use the word 
cowardly in fighting back carter told contributors to cable 
news networks world report program who are meeting in atlanta 
carter said reporters have surrendered too easily when faced 
with government restrictions and by doing so have encouraged 
suppression by other world leaders 
had the press collectively and individually said we will 
not abide by this censorship i think you could very well have 
lessened the amount of restraint on the news coverage out of south 
africa carter said 
the government of south africa under stateofemergency 
regulations enacted in 1986 prohibits reporting of unrest most 
forms of peaceful protest and a wide range of statements by 
opposition groups the nation has been torn by unrest because of 
its official policy of racial segregation or apartheid 
i think the precedent that was established in south africa is 
one of almost disgrace to the news media who have shown an absence 
of courage carter said 
carter said journalists would do better to risk expulsion from 
nations with severe press restrictions rather than to stay and 
become pawns of the government 
carter is scheduled to go to panama friday as part of an 
international delegation monitoring that countrys elections on 
sunday

makeshift measures filled the gap left by 
23000 fired bus workers thursday as mexico citys government 
grabbed the chance to revamp its inefficient transport system 
the drivers went on strike and were fired wednesday causing 
some panic but a spot survey showed commuters thursday were just 
15 minutes to half an hour late 
as you can see theres almost no problem city spokesman 
alfonso marin said in a telephone interview he said a panel of 
experts is meeting to discuss the reorganization 
we will come up with a solution in about a week right now we 
dont know what shape it will take but we are working it out 
marin said 
the fact that nearly a quarter of the capitals 85 million 
residents took the week off work reduced the strikes impact 
monday international labor day was an official holiday and on 
friday mexico commemorates an 1862 victory over the french 
union secretarygeneral nacio chicuellar said he hopes the 
government will reverse its decision to fire all striking drivers 
mechanics and clerks we hope so were waiting for them to give 
us an appointment he said 
ricardo barco lopez the unions lawyer said many strikers have 
returned to their depots in hopes of going back to work 
the federal district as the capital officially is called has 
85 million residents about 105 million more live in surrounding 
suburbs of the metropolitan area 
about 9 million commute to work daily 2 million by bus and the 
rest on subways trolleys and minibuses 
the 23000 bus workers walked off their jobs early wednesday 
rejecting a 14 percent pay raise offer and demanding 50 percent a 
conciliation board had declared the strike illegal in advance and 
the government fired them all bus workers are mexicos highest 
paid municipal employees earning more than 9000 a year 
the drivers were wrong they have no right to strike said 
imelda 46 a waitress who wakes up at 530 am to get to work 
across town by 11 am its perfect what the government did 
wednesday night the strikers tried to return to work but city 
transportation coordinator enrique jackson said it was too late a 
few hours later the city subway workers union accepted the 14 
percent increase 
to fill gaps jackson authorized taxicabs to pick up multiple 
fares allowed 1000 suburban line buses to extend their routes 
into the city and charge 16 cents a ride four times the usual 
fare he urged motorists to help stranded commuters 
he said bus workers can apply for jobs in the new system but 
did not say if there would be spots for them all 
mayor manuel camacho solis office said preliminary plans for 
the bus line would make workers part owners and allow more 
independent operation 
fare increases seem likely in line with president carlos 
salinas de gortaris campaign to make stateowned companies 
profitable or get rid of them 
tens of thousands of dissident public school teachers striking 
for higher pay and for union reforms marched through the streets of 
mexico city thursday snarling traffic between downtown and the 
presidential palace 
thousands of riot police were posted along the fivemile route 
but no violence was reported 
reporters estimated that the march swelled at times to about 
150000 teachers and supporters 
teachers won a 25 percent increase in wages and benefits and 
ouster of a union boss closely tied to the governing party they 
want the pay offer extended to nonteaching school employees and 
want negotiations speeded up on elections in at least 11 union 
locals 
the strike called by the dissident wing of the national 
federation of education workers is now in its third week and has 
closed down thousands of schools nationwide

at least five pages in a laboratory notebook 
from an ongoing scientific dispute probably were prepared up to two 
years after their dates and 20 more pages were questionable secret 
service experts told congres on thursday 
however the scientist who compiled the notebooks dr thereza 
imanishikari of tufts university testified that they had nothing 
to do with the published report of her experiments and showed only 
i am not a neat person and i am very bad at dates 
asked by the chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee rep john dingell dmich to 
explain secret service findings that a page dated aug 18 1984 
had been written on a pad beneath a page dated may 18 1985 she 
said she might have waited to may to record data taken the previous 
august 
what possible motive would i have to cheat she said i 
have lupus my sister died of lupus if i had fabricated data 
it would have mislead science to waste its scarce resources being 
used to find cures for such diseases 
other scientists and coauthors backed up her claim that the 
disputed notebooks did not bear on the controversial 1986 paper in 
the scientific journal cell which the subcommittee has been 
looking into for more than a year 
one of dr imanishikaris coauthors nobel prize winner dr 
david baltimore accused dingell of indulging in a classic case 
case of verdict first evidence later in the sevenhour hearing 
baltimore a professor of molecular biology at massachusetts 
institute of technology accused the subcommittee staff of not 
being fair after dingell expressed ostensible dismay that the major 
authors of the paper declined to respond to an informal staff 
briefing last week 
its as if we had presented you with the cell paper and asked 
you to analyze it on the spot baltimore said 
the cell paper explored the workings of the immune system in 
mice bred to have an immune system gene from another species 
allegations that notebook data did not support the paper first 
made by margot otoole of dr imanishikaris lab were 
investigated by the national institutes of health which paid for 
the research an nih consultants panel concluded that no fraud or 
misrepresentation had been committed but errors were made that the 
authors should correct 
the authors have written one correction letter to the journal 
and are preparing another 
james wyngaarden the outgoing director of the nih told the 
subcommittee that he has now ordered a reopening of the 
investigation based on a new allegation from ms otoole that data 
were missing to support one of the figures of the cell paper dr 
imanishikari said however that the scientist involved moema h 
reis now at the biological institute in sao paulo brazil had 
reported recording the missing data directly on the figures 
john w hargett chief document examiner for the forensic 
services division of the secret service said analysis of the paper 
and ink of two looseleaf notebooks showed at least one page in 
the book which was presented to us as having been prepared in 
1984 was not prepared in 1984 but was more consistent with the 
1986 book four other pages in all probability were all prepared 
around the same time as the 1986 pages and 20 other pages were 
questionable 
at least two dates appeared to have been changed hargett said 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan announced 
thursday that two offices have been established within the public 
health service to strengthen its ability to deal with scientific 
misconduct 
an office of scientific integrity review will be located at hhs 
in the office of the assistant secretary for health and will 
establish overall policies and procedures for dealing with 
scientific misconduct 
an office of scientific integrity at the national institutes of 
health in bethesda in suburban washington dc will monitor 
investigations into scientific misconduct conducted by institutions 
that receive public health service funds for biomedical or 
behavioral research it will also conduct its own investigations

soviet rookie hockey forward alexander 
mogilny viewed in the west as star material defected thursday 
just before the world champion soviet team left stockholm to return 
to moscow swedish and soviet media said 
mogilny who turned 20 in february did not show up at 
stockholms airport when the soviet national hockey team left at 
noon 
the official soviet news agency tass quoted viktor tikhonov 
head coach of the soviet national team as saying the defection was 
disgusting he said he believed mogilny was lured by promises 
of a lucrative contract with the national hockey league 
but no one in the nhl who was contacted by the associated press 
said they knew anything of the defection 
a spokeswoman at the swedish foreign ministry said she did not 
know anything about the defection the swedish immigration board 
said it had not received any application from a soviet player 
seeking political asylum 
mogilny who also plays for the soviet central red army team 
was the fifthround draft pick of the buffalo sabres last summer 
he would be the first soviet player to defect a former national 
team member sergei priakin signed with the calgary flames in 
march after the nhl and the soviet hockey federation reached an 
agreement allowing him to come to north america 
mogilny long has been considered a troublemaker on the soviet 
hockey team he served a tengame suspension before the world 
championships after a fight in a soviet league game 
a swedish newspaper reported last week that moligny had his 
monthly salary withdrawn after the incident and that he lost his 
masters of sports order still he was given permission to play 
in the world championships by the soviet sports committee 
the soviets took the world championship by defeating canada 
the tass account from moscow began the victorious soviet 
squad returned here today after trouncing every team at the world 
icehockey championships in stockholm and leaving one of the 
players behind 
soviet television also reported the defection and the 
sportscaster said a caller told team officials that mogilny took 
the decision to join one of the teams of the national hockey 
league 
tass said the incident with mogilny could harm relations 
between the soviet hockey federation and the nhl observers 
believe 
four soviet teams are scheduled to tour the nhl next season and 
the calgary flames and washington capitals are slated to visit the 
soviet union in september 
tikhonov said that mogilny a junior army lieutenant had asked 
the teams managers to give him a new apartment because he was 
going to marry and bring his parents to moscow from the city of 
khabarovsk 
tass said the soviet hockey federation and the nhl do not have 
an agreement banning illegal transfers but that nhl managers have 
said they will not support nhl clubs that engage in a talentdrain 
mogilny was in his third year with the central red army team and 
played 11 international games with the soviet national team before 
198889 
nhl spokesman gerry helper said in new york that mogilny is 
regarded as one of the games future stars but as for the 
defection helper said its the first ive heard of it 
tass quoted tikhonov as saying mogilnys defection soured our 
joyful homecoming after winning the championships the coach said 
tikhonov described relations between the soviet sports commitee 
and the nhl as stable and even expanding he said pryakhin was 
signed by the flames legally and to the satisfaction of all 
interested sides 
soviet sports authorities planned to discuss the signing of 
several soviet players for nhl clubs after the teams return from 
stockholm tass said

helicopter mechanic from des moines iowa 
the fifth victim was identified by his father as cpl lansden r 
good iii 24 of paducah ky 
the pilots were using nightvision goggles but military

nightvision goggles after several crashes 
rep frank mccloskey dind who favors a temporary suspension

under whose command a fatal night training crash occurred 
this individual is emphatic that the goggles are not safe for 
flight use to continue using the devices when even upper echelon 
officers are recommending against it simply makes no sense

and classmates expressed relief at his acquittal on most counts 
thursday but some were angry that a verdict had been delivered at 
all 
somebody better give him a vote of thanks said the towns 
former mayor russell robertson he was one of the nicest 
scapegoats this country ever had he took it right on the chin 
robertson said president bush should pardon north a former star 
athlete at philmont high school 
north was convicted thursday of three out of 12 charges for his 
role in the irancontra scandal including destroying documents he 
was acquitted of the other counts including lying to and 
obstructing congress 
im glad of the verdict said charlene yorck who also felt 
north was made a scapegoat by his superiors if president reagan 
didnt have anything to hide why didnt he get up on the stand 
north is remembered fondly by many in this town 45 miles south 
of albany where an oliver north day parade was held two years ago 
and stores stocked up on magazines with the hometown boy on the 
cover 
in august 1987 a crowd of more than 2000 turned out for the 
festivities honoring north 
norths mother ann who lives in the albany suburb of 
guilderland would not comment on the verdict 
government superiors had to know what north was doing said 
rebecca bonesteel who walked down philmonts sunny main street 
with her two sons 
i thought he was not exactly innocent of the things he was 
doing but i think he was acting on orders from a higher authority 
bonesteel said 
i think they ought to let him forget about it said ralph 
hoag who said he was a year ahead of north at philmont high 
school he was a good kid then i still like him 
not everyone was behind the hometown boy one woman who refused 
to give her name said shed gotten into tiffs with friends and 
neighbors over north who she said belongs in jail 
joseph krein pausing for a soda at a local convenience store 
said he was disgusted with the verdict 
it almost looks like they had to nail him with something 
krein said if he had gotten off scotfree it would have been 
too obvious i think theyre just going to slap his wrist 
but krein added i dont think he was a hero sure he did what 
he was told but didnt he have a conscience

the jurors in the oliver north trial did a 
lot of bickering and arguing but finally agreed to convict the 
former white house aide on three counts after a strong prayer 
one juror said thursday 
it was tough to come up with a decision earl f williams 
told reporters 
north was convicted of altering and shredding documents and of 
two other charges in the irancontra affair he was acquitted on 
nine other counts 
most of the jurors declined to discuss the deliberations saying 
they were tired and wanted time with their families the jury had 
been sequestered since april 20 
juror justine newell parrish said that reaching a verdict was 
the hardest decision she ever had to make 
now she said i just want to be with my family 
im going to take my shower and catch the next flight out of 
here to jamaica said juror jean johnson 
williams a former security guard said the jury did not agree 
on the guilty counts until thursday the 12th day of deliberations 
although some of the acquittals had been decided earlier 
the jury was split a while on some of the counts and in a 
case such as this there is a lot of bickering and arguing he 
said 
it was touch and go all the way he said 
but he added with gods help we prayed a lot and made a 
decision 
williams said the breaking point came thursday when one of the 
jurors said a strong prayer and it seemed to get everybody 
together and we came to a decision 
the juror said north was a credible witness i believed him 
he said no i dont think he should go to jail 
north who was at the center of the secret reagan administration 
effort to aid the nicaraguan contras could face up to 10 years in 
prison on the convictions 
the jury included nine women and three men 
williams said the female jurors were really set in their 
ways but after prayer a little consideration and friendly talking 
they came right in with us but he did not say if they wanted to 
acquit or convict north 
williams said another reason the jurors took as long as they did 
was because of the numerous documents 
there were no dominant characters on the jury williams said 
we were all pretty strongit was touch and goat one time 
this person might be a little strong and another time that person 
might be a little strong 
in general said williams the experience wasnt a bad 
situation but it was a trying experience and i wouldnt want to go 
through it again

gates 62 had announced three months ago that he was forming an 
exploratory committee to consider a gubernatorial candidacy and 
test his political support he said he would not actively campaign 
and but would continue as police chief

republican frontrunner and former baseball commissioner peter 
ueberroth who also has strong statewide recognition and has been 
mentioned as a possible gop candidate 
the chief could not be reached immediately by telephone 
although his secretary confirmed that he had decided to quit 
in an interview with knbctv gates cited his lack of support 
among conservatives and republican party regulars as reasons to 
pull out he also said that his outspokenness worked against him 
he said he believes a political candidate should be willing to 
put his political career his reputation on the block and go 
forward with an issue because he believes in that issue and we 
dont have that 
gates was booed april 1 in orange county during his address at 
the annual meeting of the california republican assembly an 
influential grassroots conservative group 
members of the audience complained stridently that gates had 
condoned police officers rough treatment during arrests of

he plans to remain police chief 
i think that the chief of police of los angeles can have more 
influence than any other statewide official except the governor

a scientist who helped develop the theory 
that nuclear war could plunge earth into a nuclear winter and a 
chemist who pioneered studies of ocean pollutants have been named 
winners of the 1989 tyler prize 
the prize for environmental achievement will be awarded friday 
night to paul crutzen director of atmospheric chemistry at west 
germanys max planck institute for chemistry and edward goldberg 
of the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla calif the 
prize committee announced 
they will split the 150000 prize money and receive gold 
medallions 
the group credited crutzen with important discoveries about 
depletion of earths protective highaltitude ozone layer the 
formation of ozone as a pollutant at lower altitudes the nuclear 
winter theory and humanitys capacity to upset the global 
atmosphere 
crutzens research indicating the ozone layer could be harmed by 
nitrogen oxide pollutants played a role in the debate over 
supersonic transport aircraft in the 1970s it also helped lead to 
later discoveries that refrigerant gases called chlorofluorocarbons 
were damaging earths ozone shield the prize committee said 
in 1982 crutzen and scientist john birks published a paper 
the atmosphere after a nuclear war twilight at noon in which 
they hypothesized that fires from nuclear warfare would blanket 
earth with smoke blocking enough sunlight to damage food crops 
the prize committee said it was the fundamental paper that led 
another group of scientists to coin the term nuclear winter and 
demonstrate that nuclear war could temporarily plunge the planet 
into freezing temperatures and cause mass starvation of survivors 
goldberg a chemistry professor at scripps dedicated much of 
his career to monitoring and finding solutions to ocean pollution 
the tyler committee said 
he helped get toxic tributyl tin boat paints banned in 
california started the mussel watch program to monitor ocean 
pollutant levels by measuring toxic contaminants in oysters and 
mussels and pioneered ocean pollution research on the insecticide 
ddt radioactive substances heavy metals and hydrocarbons 
the committee also said goldberg has pushed for using the oceans 
as safe dumping grounds for nontoxic waste to reduce air and 
groundwater pollution due to waste burning and landfill disposal 
the tyler prize administered by the university of southern 
california was established in 1973 by alice c tyler and her 
husband the late john c tyler founder of farmers insurance group

an australian aborigine at the center 
of a manhunt that sparked a public uproar was arrested with a 
hostage on the queensland gold coast after a 10day sweep across 
three states police said thursday 
john porter captured late wednesday was the key suspect in the 
shooting and wounding of two sydney policemen during an attempted 
car theft on april 24 
one of the policemen allegedly shot by porter 26yearold alan 
mcqueen died friday morning despite emergency surgery in which 
doctors removed a lung a kidney and most of his liver 
the manhunt for porter led to a dawn raid on a surburban sydney 
home last week in which an unarmed aborigine was fatally shot 
sparking an outcry among australians over the rough treatment of 
aborigines 
aboriginal activists responded to the killing of david gundy by 
putting posters up around the city calling for the murder of ted 
pickering police minister of new south wales state 
they also demanded a royal commission the highest form of 
inquiry available into police conduct 
aborigines who number about 160000 or 1 per cent of the 16 
million population also are angered by the slow progress of a 
government inquiry into more than 100 aboriginal deaths in police 
custody since 1980 
police conduct during the manhunt for porter captured frontpage 
headlines after authorities admitted that queensland police faked 
an arrest watched it reported on the evening television news and 
then told the media it was a hoax 
police said thursday that porter 27 recently was released from 
jail on parole and said he had six other criminal convictions on 
drugs and assault charges 
police said porter tried wednesday to kidnap a woman but she 
escaped and alerted police 
they said porter who was armed with a 32calber pistol 
surrendered quietly when surrounded outside an apartment block on 
the famed coastal strip of northeast australia 
police said he apparently took a man hostage after driving north 
from sydney the hostage was not injured 
porter was charged at the brisbane magistrates court with 
kidnapping grievous bodily harm and use of an unlicensed firearm

cbs news said thursday it is 
disturbed by revelations that sheriffs deputies impersonated 
members of its staff and will have an attorney contact the kootenai 
county sheriff 
undercover kootenai county deputies posed as members of a cbs 
crew in march in napa calif and another deputy claimed he was a 
montana reporter at a seattle rally in april sheriff pierce clegg 
acknowledged this week 
he said he has since adopted a policy against using such covers 
but cant promise it will never happen again clegg was unavailable 
for comment thursday said his secretary marlee aurora 
we do understand the situation it puts you reporters in 
clegg said earlier this week it would be stupid of me to say it 
will never happen again because rules are made to be broken but 
its not our intention to get information that way 
clegg said both undercover operations were to gather information 
on people expected to attend or counterdemonstrate at a 
whitesupremacist convention that took place in the county april 
2123 
deputy capt tom dickson conceded that he identified himself as 
a reporter for the missoulian in montana on april 15 when 
approached by a member of the seattle nonviolent action group 
dickson was videotaping participants at a rally to counter the 
skinhead convention the next week 
clegg also confirmed that a month earlier two of his deputies 
posed as members of a cbs crew to videotape protesters and 
neonazis at a napa calif skinhead gathering they were acting 
officially along with members of a southern california law 
enforcement agency clegg declined to identify 
the missoulian filed objections with clegg over the april 
incident and cbs news spokesman tom goodman in new york said 
wednesday the network had not been able to reach clegg yet about 
the march 4 incident in california 
thursday goodman said cbs will seek assurances from 
appropriate law enforcement officials in kootenai county that these 
actions will not be repeated 
he said a cbs lawyer will contact clegg possibly friday

an undercover investigation into the 
smuggling of chinese aliens into the united states led to nine 
arrests and gave officials a rare glimpse into how such operations 
work federal authorities said thursday 
over the course of the last few months weve learned more 
about smuggling than we have in the last 200 years benedict 
ferro buffalo district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service said thursday 
the investigation was one of the few to penetrate beyond the 
transporter level to the level of those who actually arrange 
the transactions arrangers are at the level above the actual 
smuggler himself ferro said 
two arrangers at least three illegal aliens brought into the 
country by the ring and 20 other people thought to be illegal 
aliens were arrested wednesday in restaurants in new york citys 
chinatown section ferro said 
three illegal aliens also were arrested in toronto earlier in 
the week by royal canadian mounted police and another was arrested 
last week by ins agents in albany 
three people who were indicted for conspiring to violate us 
immigration laws were being sought along with two other reputed 
smugglers ferro said 
he said the smuggling rings transported chinese nationals from 
hong kong to vancouver to toronto and had links to organized crime 
in china aliens were then transported across the niagara river 
which forms the boundary between the united states and canada and 
eventually to chinatown 
i would estimate that those nine arrangers have been 
responsible for hundreds of chinese being smuggled though these 
routes said ferro 
buffalo investigators began their investigation a year ago when 
a smuggler arrested by ins agents agreed to cooperate the 
informant introduced agents to the toronto end of the smuggling 
rings which undercover agents infiltrated 
the agents then became transporters agreeing to move aliens 
across one of four international bridges linking the united states 
and canada 
canada is a favored port of entry to north america because hong 
kong residents dont need a visa to visit canada officials said 
the investigation turned up arrangers previously on the 
sideline who we had not identified roots we hadnt identified in 
the past meeting places and safe houses the kinds of things we 
dont get being outside the organization he said 
agents learned of elaborate smuggling contracts which controlled 
the whole process from china to new york city ferro said the cost 
of the trip to aliens was usually about 20000 
they signed contracts which included such things as the 
posting of bail should they get caught he said 
once in chinatown those who are smuggled into the country often 
work many years for low wages in restaurants and sweatshops to 
pay back the cost of the trip 
more ominously ferro said the illegal aliens find themselves 
financially over their heads and are forced to be involved in 
criminal activities as a way of repaying the debt 
very often these gangs in chinatown are made up of people 
who are forced to perform in the gangs he said 
these are clearly the people we were trying to get said 
ferro of the arrests there are some significant aspects of 
chinese smuggling that the arrests of these people will address 
two of those arrested tin seong hui and william tsoi both of 
manhattan were accused of arranging the trips in a warrant issued 
by us district court judge john t curtin in buffalo 
most of those arrested were charged with conspiracy to transport 
illegal aliens which ferro said is punishable by fines up to 
250000 and five years in jail

the agency a wing of the us labor department assigned the 
case to joe kirkham of louisville who has mediated labor disputes 
for 28 years

together next week times and sites had not been decided late 
thursday 
the strike which began april 5 affects about 1500 miners in 
virginia and west virginia two hundred other union miners working 
at pittston operations in kentucky have not yet left their jobs 
for the most part the demonstrations have been nonviolent and 
the charges limited to obstructing free passage a misdemeanor 
on tuesday however seven miners and two contract drivers for 
the company were injured when miners pelted the trucks with rocks 
and the drivers plowed into demonstrators 
state police thursday arrested 21 striking miners for blocking 
the entrance to a pittston mine and processing plant at mcclure in 
separate incidents later in the day they arrested 14 miners for 
throwing rocks at coal trucks lt jb willis said

south africa offered up to 17 million for secrets 
of a british missile manufactured in northern ireland independent 
television news said thursday 
itn said the offer was made to probritish protestant 
paramilitary groups for the new surfacetoair starstreak missile 
in return for cash or arms 
rae killen south africas ambassador in london said on the 
evening news program he doubted very much if money was offered for 
starstreak secrets 
i would hope that no action is taken that would cause problems 
to our britishsouth african relations he said 
the starstreak not yet fully developed is scheduled to upgrade 
british air defenses in the 1990s 
neither protestant extremist sources nor the northern ireland 
police had any immediate comment on the report 
starstreak made at short brothers factory in belfast was top 
of the south africans shopping list according to the program 
which quoted sources in the provinces protestant majority 
protestant extremists have tried to counter the outlawed irish 
republican armys struggle to end british rule and unite the 
province with the irish republic 
the itn report said a man from northern ireland living in south 
africa approached protestant paramilitaries in 1985 and suggested 
that a request for arms would be received sympathetically it said 
one official of such a group spent two weeks in south africa 
inspecting weapons in 1985 
the program said the group could not afford the asking price of 
312500 so the south africans suggested an exchange of missile 
parts for a delivery to northern ireland of illegal weapons 
prime minister margaret thatcher and foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe complained last month to barend du plessis the 
visiting south african finance minister about alleged attempts to 
steal missile secrets 
howe said britain would view seriously any support by any 
government for those engaged in violence in the united kingdom 
the foreign office said 
published reports in britain said south africa supplied arms to 
protestant groups in january 1988 in return for blueprints of 
blowpipe a shoulderfired antiaircraft missile made at short 
brothers and also for a cash payment of 255000 
three south african officials implicated in the blowpipe case 
were ordered last week to leave france 
the federal prosecutors office in switzerland is investigating 
allegations that an american with an office in geneva was involved

atlantis astronauts safely in 
orbit after a cliffhanger weather delay sent the magellan 
spacecraft streaking across the solar system thursday night on a 
550 million mapmaking mission to venus 
the robot spacecraft reviving an american planetaryscience 
program dormant for a decade slipped from the shuttles cargo bay 
at 901 pm edt and drifted into space 
magellan is deployed reported shuttle commander david 
walker 
an hour later after atlantis moved a safe distance away both 
stages of a spacecraft motor fired to start magellan on a 456day 
journey to venus 158 million miles away it will travel 806 
million miles looping 1 times around the sun before reaching and 
orbiting its target in august 1990 
while its too early to tell about the major portion of 
magellans mission were pleased its gone so well so far 
walker replied when told both stages had fired 
minutes later mission control reported 
magellan is coming to life and is on a proper path toward 
venus falling toward the sun 
mission specialists mark lee and mary cleave operating remote 
controls inside the shuttle cabin checked the health of the space 
probe before sending a signal that springejected it into its own 
orbit while atlantis soared over the pacific ocean 600 miles 
southwest of los angeles 
magellan the first planetary craft ever launched from a 
shuttle is to map up to 90 percent of venus cloudshrouded 
surface its highresolution radar system is expected to produce 
images of objects as small as a football field 10 times the 
clarity of any previous pictures of the mysterious planet 
the release of magellan the main task of the fourday flight 
came a little more than six hours after atlantis thundered into 
orbit 184 miles high 
the launch was delayed 59 minutes by shifting clouds and winds 
that had threatened the second postponement in six days when 
atlantis finally left its pad just five minutes remained in the 
launch window dictated by the need to have the shuttle in the 
proper position to dispatch magellan to venus 
the launch team had advanced the countdown to the 5minute mark 
and held there waiting for a break in the clouds that obscured a 
runway near the launch pad where atlantis would land in an 
emergency 
chief astronaut dan brandenstein flying a weather scout plane 
found a break signaled the goahead and the count was started and 
carried down to the blazing liftoff 
it was another cliffhanger im glad you stuck with it 
acting nasa administrator dale d myers said as he congratulated 
the launch team 
it was the 60th us maninspace flight the 29th for the 
shuttle and the fourth since the challenger explosion more than 
three years ago 
four of us are very happy to be back in space and the fifth 
one is very happy to be here radioed walker 
walker pilot ron grabe and mission specialists cleave and 
norman thagard flew on previous shuttle flights lee is a rookie 
did somebody win the pool up there mission control 
commentator john creighton asked the crew we had only five 
minutes left in the window 
we wouldnt want to push it any closer replied walker 
the commander also reported atlantis separation from its 
external fuel tank as it entered orbit was rougher than he 
remembered on his first shuttle flight 
it was more violent although i hate to use that word he 
said it wasnt the soft separation i remembered from the 
previous flight 
a launch attempt last friday was halted with just 31 seconds to 
go because of a short circuit in an engine fuel pump technicians 
worked around the clock over the weekend to replace the pump and a 
fuel line nasa had to launch magellan by may 28 or ground it for 
two years until earth and venus were again in the proper alignment 
among tens of thousands who watched the rare afternoon liftoff 
were some of the countrys most renowned planetary scientists they 
have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978 
when pioneervenus was launched on the last us planetary 
expedition 
success for magellan would signal the start of a sciencerich 
threeyear period during which five major probes will be rocketed 
into space 
the overture the symphony begins with magellan said nasa 
science chief lennard fisk its going to be a long symphony 
its going to have a lot of crescendos nobody is going to 
question our leadership in planetary science again 
fisk hailed magellans flight as the start of a second golden 
age of space science the first was the period from the mid1960s 
to the late1970s when unmanned spacecraft for the first time were 
launched to make closeup examinations of venus mars mercury 
jupiter saturn and uranus 
looking ahead fisk said that in august the voyager 2 spacecraft 
launched in 1977 will take the first close look at neptune after a 
planetary odyssey that earlier took it near jupiter saturn and 
uranus 
in october another atlantis crew is to start the galileo probe 
on its way to jupiter the hubble space telescope is scheduled for 
launch from a shuttle early next year ulysses is to orbit the sun 
in october 1990 and the mars observer spacecraft will be dispatched 
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket 
the planetary program had languished for 11 years because of a 
combination of nasa budget cuts and the challenger explosion that 
delayed most of these missions more than three years 
when magellan reaches venus in august 1990 it is to fire into 
orbit and start its 243day mapping assignment 
the goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of 
the planet said stephen saunders magellan project scientist 
the radar is designed to pierce venus sulfuric acid clouds and 
produce images showing features as small as 100 yards across the 
size of a football field in comparison two 1983 soviet spacecraft 
captured features about 1200 yards across and the 1978 
pioneervenus could not distinguish anything smaller than 60 miles 
across 
everything we have learned about planetary science says that 
venus is the planet most like earth saunders said a major 
question is why earth and venus evolved so differently even though 
at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical 
the surface temperature of earths sultry twin is 900 degrees 
fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead and the atmospheric pressure 
is 90 times greater than that on earth 
the atmosphere of venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide 
and the upper clouds which hide the planet from view are made up 
of sulfuric acid droplets earlier exploration by unmanned 
spacecraft have revealed continentsized plateaus deep canyons and 
one of the highest mountains in the solar system 
saunders said the magellan pictures might answer questions about 
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether 
venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal 
plates similar to those on earth

the wouldbe novels began badly and 
turned worse before their first sentences thudded to an end 
laughable tributes to a once popular victorian master of banality 
and gratuitous polysyllabic prose 
and those were the winners 
the 8th international bulwerlytton fiction contest sponsored 
by the san jose state university english department unleashed its 
uh best entries thursday from the seamy underside of 
literature 
the grand prize from the nearly 10000 execrable entries from 
around the world went to ray c gainey of indianapolis for this bit 
of amusing albeit repulsive imagery 
professor frobisher couldnt believe he had missed seeing it 
for so long it was after all right there under his nose but 
in all his years of research into the intricate and mysterious ways 
of the universe he had never noticed that the freckles on his 
upper lip just below and to the left of the nostril partially 
hidden until now by the hairy mole he had just removed a week 
before exactly matched the pattern of the stars in the pleiades 
down to the angry red zit that had just popped up where he and his 
colleagues had only today discovered an exploding nova 
for his effort gainey gained a word processor confirming the 
computer age adage garbage in garbage out 
my wife was jumping up and down when she called me at work 
said gainey in a telephone interview they dragged me out of a 
meeting i thought somebody was dead 
gainey who enters as many as 30 items a year said he won 
dishonorable mentions in 1985 1986 and 1987 
the contest founded by english professor scott rice honors as 
it were edward george bulwerlytton 
rice describes lytton as the author of some of victorian 
literatures most turgid prose and notes that the ponderous 
meandering opening sentence to his novel paul clifford which 
began it was a dark and stormy night inspired not only the 
contest but the famous literary beagle snoopy 
the contest which rice calls a sneaky but enjoyable way to 
encourage writing invites insipid inkslingers to offer opening 
sentences to the worst possible hypothetical novels 
as anyone who has spent time on an entry knows it takes a 
good writer to write bad deliberately rice says 
here then are some of the deliberately bad winners the creme 
da dreck in various genres 
detective fiction sgt tom katt wasnt 100 percent sure of 
anything but he knew something wasnt quite right when the factory

margaret thatcher celebrated her 10th anniversary 
in power thursday declaring she has transformed britain but she 
apparently lost a previously safe welsh parliamentary district to 
socialists 
in northern ireland the irish republican army which has vowed 
to assassinate mrs thatcher killed a british soldier and said the 
bomb attack was a 10th anniversary reminder that the irish 
question remains unresolved 
mrs thatcher escaped injury in 1984 when the outlawed ira blew 
up her hotel in brighton england killing five members of her 
conservative party the ira warned her afterward we only have to 
be lucky once you have to be lucky always 
former president reagan telephoned anniversary congratulations 
thursday from california an aide said the reagans plan to visit 
london next month 
soviet tv gave her a mixed review it said she had been able to 
noticeably raise the international authority of england and 
inject a new dynamism into the economy but had done so at the 
expense of british workers 
leaders of the main opposition labor party were particularly 
delighted thursday at their apparent win in the vale of glamorgan 
a largely rural welsh district declaring they were on their way 
back to power after a decade in the shadows 
the conservatives held the parliamentary seat for 38 years 
thursdays special election was caused by the death of the previous 
legislator 
preelection polls predicted a tory loss this partly reflected 
opposition to an overhaul of the free national health service 
among the latest targets of mrs thatchers rightwing revolution 
in separate county council elections in england and wales both 
conservatives and labor made substantial gains largely at the 
expense of the two squabbling center parties the social and 
liberal democratic party and the the smaller social democratic 
party 
with results declared early friday from 40 of the 47 county 
councils the conservatives had overall control of 14 up from 
seven and labor had overall control of 12 including four new 
gains 
the social and liberal democratic party kept control of its 
district the isle of wight in county council elections but lost 
seats across the country 
of the remaining councils declared no party had overall control 
in 11 and two were controlled by independents 
speaking to reporters on the steps of her 10 downing st office 
thursday morning mrs thatcher said britain has been 
transformed since she ousted james callaghans labor party 
government and took office may 4 1979 
the standard of living for almost everyone is higher and i 
think everyone recognizes that britains standing in the world is 
greater than its been for many a very long year she said 
mrs thatcher 63 swept to power on a wave of antiunion 
sentiment after a winter of strikes left garbage piled across the 
country hospitals turning away the sick and the dead unburied 
europes first woman prime minister since has won two more 
elections she is the longest continuously serving british prime 
minister this century and is expected to run for a fourth term 
she gave no hint when she might go saying theres no thought 
of slowing down 
mrs thatcher cut an anniversary cake in the house of commons 
and was guest of honor at a downing street dinner thursday given by 
her 21 cabinet colleagues they are all men and only three are 
survivors of her first cabinet 
otherwise it was a regular day that included furious exchanges 
in the commons with opposition leader neil kinnock with whom she 
has a particularly antagonistic relationship 
he charged her with failing to fulfill st francis of assisis 
prayer where there is discord may we bring harmony which she 
quoted on the steps of downing street when she moved in 
shouting above labor jeers mrs thatcher retorted remember 
the discord in the winter of discontent in 1979 when under 
socialism you couldnt even get the dead buried

a grand jury has begun investigating 
fired tanker captain joseph hazelwood for possible felony 
violations stemming from his role in the nations worst oil spill 
sources said thursday 
hazelwood free on 50000 bail already has been ordered to 
stand trial june 20 in valdez on three misdemeanor charges that 
include operating a vessel while drunk he has pleaded innocent 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile arrived thursday night to 
inspect beaches fouled by the spill alaska officials were eager to 
give him a tour according to the states ranking environmental 
official at the spill zone 
hes going to see oil and lots of it said bill lamoreaux of 
the state department of environmental conservation the beach on 
smith island where a wooden viewing platform has been constructed 
for quayle was among the hardest hit 
quayles government jet touched down about 630 pm 1030 edt 
at cordova about 50 miles from the site of the exxon valdez tanker 
crash following the smith island stop he was scheduled to visit 
elmendorf air force base outside anchorage later for a news 
conference 
federal transportation secretary samuel skinner alaska gov 
steve cowper and coast guard commandant paul yost jr were expected 
to accompany quayle 
the grand jury probe is the first indication that hazelwood 42 
faces felony charges stemming from the spill march 24 when his 
vessel slammed into a reef and poured more than 10 million gallons 
of crude into prince william sound 
sources at the state district court and the district attorneys 
office who spoke on condition of anonymity said the grand jury 
was taking testimony on the possibility that hazelwood committed a 
felony in connection with his conduct the night of the spill 
one source said the probe concerned seconddegree criminal 
mischief which carrys a maximum term of five years in prison for 
first offenders the sentence is often two years or less with 
probation 
in other developments exxon officials thursday proposed arming 
the guards of their cleanup crews with shotguns rather than 
chemical sprays theyre now carrying to protect them against the 
coastal brown bears 
but state and federal environmental officials were concerned 
that inexperienced guards might shoot the bears needlessly 
exxon also launched a public relations offensive thursday 
against critics of its cleanup plan saying government bureaucracy 
has crippled the effort 
its a comprehensive plan its a good plan its an 
economically sound plan and were convinced it will work otto 
harrison exxons executive supervising the cleanup from valdez 
said in an interview on abcs good morning america 
exxon president lee r raymond at a news conference in his new 
york offices denied the company was trying to cut corners in the 
cleanup but he complained that as many as 14 government agencies 
may be involved in approving and carrying out the final plan 
i want one person in charge i dont care who it is because 
there has to be one person that finally says hey its midnight 
and we gotta do something raymond said anything reasonable 
anything that makes sense that they would say you ought to do in 
addition to what you have in the plan well do it 
raymond also said exxon is not seeking exemptions from 
environmental laws although the oil companys proposal 
specifically calls for letters of nonobjection waivers and 
permit modifications from state and local governments to dispose 
of the oil waste at the alyeska pipeline service co terminal in 
valdez 
raymond said yost who has authority over whether exxons 
cleanup proposal is approved was encouraged by exxons proposal 
dennis hubbard a spokesman for yost in valdez said the commandant 
has not taken a position on the plan 
earlier this week yost called the plan very thin very light 
theres not a lot of backup subsantiation 
oil from the spill has spread throughout the sound and 
contaminated shores more than 525 miles to the southwest including 
the spectacular katmai national park a wildlife refuge 
exxon has recommended cleaning 364 miles of alaska coastline by 
midseptember but the company wants to leave untouched nearly 200 
of those miles and let them be cleaned by nature 
the state responding to a request from yost to evaulate exxons 
revised cleanup plan rejected the exxon proposal saying it was 
inadequate and didnt provide for enough personnel to do the job

tall and thin pete seeger stood in front of 
the microphone in his blue jeans and flowered shirt hat pushed 
back on his head and picked out the cords on his banjo 
hes still singing the same tunes and has changed little since 
the glory days of folk music two decades ago 
thousands of those jammed into and around the big tent at the 
new orleans jazz and heritage festival knew the words they stood 
and sang without prompting 
deep in my heart i do believe we shall overcome someday 
abbie hoffman is dead jerry rubin is part of the establishment 
jane fonda is selling exercise tapes and other activists of the 
1960s have either copped out burned out or dropped out but the 
70yearold folk singer from benton ny is still at it 
seegers songs are the songs he sang for civil rights to ban 
the bomb to cry out against the war in vietnam and poverty and to 
fight for human rights throughout the world we shall overcome 
this land is your land 
the audience was made up of those who marched to his tunes 
during the turbulent 60s and who think of that era as history 
my records have never sold very well a thousand copies here 
1000 copies there but probably every elementary school system in 
the country has at least one teacher who has at least one of them 
and so kids grow up knowing my work seeger said of his continued 
popularity 
he continues to perform once or twice a week 
i usually sing to small groups 100 200 people i still have 
things to tell them nobody in this world knows all the answers 
all we can do is encourage people to hope i try to do that he 
said 
his values once the trendy slogans of a generation have held 
up for him he lists his heroes as those who suffered on the front 
lines to bring civil rights to the south and peace to southeast 
asia 
seeger said hes thoroughly respectable now disgracefully so 
that wasnt always true at the height of the mccarthy era he was 
held in contempt of congress and banned from television in 1949 
while marching with the actor author and singer paul robeson 
seeger was attacked by members of the ku klux klan 
would he rather be remembered for his music or his politics 
seeger said it doesnt matter what matters he said is what he 
can do now 
ive always said that my epitaph will be he done his 
damnedest 
seegers second book everybody say freedom written with 
robert reser is due out this year he and arlo guthrie may do a 
concert together later this year he is devoted to the clearwater 
project an effort he organized years ago to help clean up the 
polluted hudson river in new yorknew jersey he also is working 
for world disarmament 
its one of the most important issues there is he said 
the 60s may not get a curtain call but seegers not the only 
one carrying on that tradition 
there are still people who care he said still people who 
think they can make things better as long as that is true in this 
country were ok theres an old saying hope is the opiate of 
the masses i guess im still singing about hope who knows if 
people listen long enough it may make them think about more than 
the music who knows

when the history of the 20th century is written 
zbigniew brzezinski is sure the chapter on communism will read like 
an obituary so sure that the former white house policymaker 
already has it written 
there is no doubt that we are all witnesses to an event of 
fundamental importance brzezinski said in a recent interview 
about his new book the grand failure the birth and death of 
communism in the twentieth century 
this century to all of us in different ways was dominated by 
communism communism defined the philosophical debate communism 
was the source of the cold war the challenge and that is now 
fading 
the book by the former national security adviser to president 
carter has received good reviews and climbed bestseller lists 
even president bush is reading the book according to 
brzezinski but the polishborn scholar who serves on bushs 
independent foreign intelligence advisory board wouldnt say how 
his views are influencing bushs longrunning foreign policy review 
the books popularity attests to the audience for a cogent 
explanation of profound changes sweeping the communist world today 
when an ideology ceases to motivate people when it is 
discredited when it is no longer a source for policy it is dying 
and that is what is happening thats a momentous change he said 
according to brzezinski who is credited with helping to 
normalize uschinese relations in the late 1970s the failure of 
the communist command economy is at the heart of the ideologys 
failure 
he concludes that soviet communism will wither away leaving the 
country in a decadelong systemic crisis trying to hold itself 
together 
china with deeper cultural traditions will evolve into a 
noncommunist nation whose communist leaders will argue mostly 
about the pace of change 
reforms in smaller communist nations will vary in their success 
but all will depart from the evidently disastrous socialist path 
brzezinski writes 
there have been people whove always said communism is a 
failure he said but now the realization is pervasive among 
the leaders who profess to guide communism 
to save the soviet economy soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
has to redefine the partys role in society the author says he is 
seeking mass support by granting more political and social openness 
glasnost and restructuring the government to circumvent 
conservative leaders but the reforms are unleashing national 
ethnic passions among russians and nonrussians that threaten to 
tear the country apart 
its economic success can only be purchased at the cost of 
political stablility while its political stability can only be 
sustained at the cost of economic failure brzezinski writes 
chinas reforms have a better chance for success mostly because 
of pragmatic leadership and deeper cultural traditions that will 
absorb free market reforms more readily modern china may enter 
the 21st century still ruled by communists but it will not be a 
communized china he writes 
brzezinski discounts any retrenchment in beijings recent 
decision to restrict market activities to cool its overheating 
economy 
youre going have these zigzags but its not a pullback in 
any way to the original starting point he said 
it highlights the fact ultimately that there is no halfway 
house between partial communism and partial free market systems 
and communist systems do find it difficult to make that basic 
transition 
east european countries will seek greater freedom from moscow 
he said the west should encourage their independence without 
trying to dismantle the warsaw pact and deny moscow its 
legitimate security interests 
central american radicals may use communism as a rallying point 
against americanism expansionism american indifference american 
clumsiness and american proximity brzezinski said 
but even in central america none of the revolutionary 
leaders if you asked them would say if we win we want to build 
the system like the one the soviets have 
communisms demise largely reduces the ussoviet confrontation 
to the military dimension brzezinski said the real danger is 
that we will confuse the reforms and weakness with disarmament the 
former is happening the latter has not happened yet 
brzezinski said moscow has been losing the cold war but it has 
achieved a tepid armistice with the united states and could 
reassert itself after recovering from domestic problems 
our job is to translate this armistice into a more lasting and 
genuine accommodation brzezinski said

if you had your choice of paying half price for 
a timeshare unit at a vacation condominium or paying full price 
and receiving a 6 watch which would you take 
strange isnt it that many people each year pay the full price 
and accept the free gift when identical units in the same 
resort might have no takers at thousands of dollars less 
the reason says clinton burr is in the marketing 
each year more than 10 million americans are solicited to attend 
sales presentations at full price and receive an inexpensive gift 
he says while unbeknownst to them existing owners are willing to 
sell identical units for less 
acting on that knowledge burr established the resort property 
owners association bleeding and starving his family the young 
attorney built rpoa into a 17000member organization in less than 
two years 
saturday through monday he inspects and rates properties for 
resort reports his twicemonthly newsletter and for rpoa 
guides to southeast and southwest properties a northern states 
guide will be ready in september 
last weekend he toured cape cod mass newport ri and the 
maine coast before flying home to record his data and attend to his 
law practice while others bask in luxury he works convinced he 
is creating an institution 
burr seeks to be neutral a source of unbiased information in an 
industry where buyers sellers and renters have had no basic 
information source timesharing will grow he says although right 
now its reputation is damaged 
its a great way for families and seniors to vacation he 
says it matters little if they buy or if they rent from existing 
owners he says since they can enjoy spaciousness and luxury at 
prices within their budgets 
his reasons luxury condos resort properties with a convenant 
tying them to firstrate facilities such as pools oceanfront and 
golf courses are costing too much for the mass market and the 
costs might rise 
the tax benefits might disappear also condo owners now may 
deduct their mortgage interest costs and if they rent out their 
units they may claim depreciation also someday that might end 
congress is eyeing such deductions 
with costs high burr believes timesharing or sharing 
ownership of a unit with others might benefit from such 
crackdowns and he intends to be a factor in it by providing 
information similar to todays mobil travel guides 
time shares were introduced in the early 1970s as a way for 
vacationers to save through partial ownership it was a way for 
resorts to survive it was a way for ordinary folks to afford 
highclass accommodations 
then came the high pressure congratulations you have won a 
free cruise to the bahamas or maybe it was a 995 diamond and 
sapphire bracelet or a sports watch or a 35mmcamera or diamond 
earrings 
wholesale the cruise was worth 25 the bracelet 50 the watch 
6 the camera 5 the earrings made of industrial diamond dust 
2 for this you had to claim your prize in 10 days and present a 
credit card number 
not all such promotions are phony but many are burr himself a 
timesharer knew that a greater flow of unbiased information was 
needed if the healthy market he foresaw were to take hold 
a current report on sales of timeshare units is an example 
sales by resort developers have grown sharply in the past decade 
from an annual sales volume of 281 million in 1978 to about 18 
billion in 1988 
startlingly however owners of nearly a halfmillion timeshare 
units in the united states have been unable to sell their 
properties for them the market is a disaster even those who 
manage to sell often fail to profit 
at the same time operators of the very same resorts are selling 
identical units at higher prices the difference high pressure and 
marketing skills 
to help correct the situation burr offers to put individual 
timeshare sellers in touch with sales organizations if they write 
to him at po box 2395 northbrook ill 60062 or call him at 
312 2365684 
he says hes happy to provide the service to members and 
nonmembers because he wants to strengthen the market hed be even 
happier and they would be too he says if they joined at 15 a 
year

the fox broadcasting co is launching a 
onceamonth movie night in preparation for regular primetime 
programming on monday nights to begin in september 
the movies begin monday may 15 with david cronenbergs 
boxoffice hit the fly 
we really see the movies and the new night of programming as 
two separate things said peter chernin new president of the fox 
entertainment group soon after we begin mondaynight 
programming we hope to start a movie night probably on tuesday 
other upcoming movies in the fox lineup include big trouble in 
little china scheduled to air monday june 5 jumpin jack 
flash july 10 and mannequin aug 28 
the tuesday movies will begin oct 3 with black widow 
followed by predator and revenge of the nerds part ii 
meanwhile fox is looking at 13 pilots to fill two hours of 
primetime programming on monday beginning sept 11 among them 
are what would be the first television project from film director 
francis ford coppola based on his movie version se hintons 
teenappeal book the outsiders 
our company is solid and the outlook is bullish said 
chernin were going to put on monday night then were going to 
get on with the business of programming every night of the week 
i think its going to be easier going forward now than in the 
past the stations are stronger when we started sunday night we 
had no place to promote it two years ago the stations may have had 
some trepidation but theyve had such success theyre ready to 
tell us to start programming more nights everyones ratings are 
up 
fox broadcasting lost 90 million last year but chernin said 
the fledgling network will come close to breaking even this fiscal 
year 
theres clearly a good deal of pride and pleasure in how far 
weve come in the last year he said 
two fox sunday shows married with children and 
americas most wanted often finish ahead of a third of the big 
networks shows in the nielsen ratings plans are now being made to 
improve the ratings for foxs other shows duet its garry 
shandlings show and the tracey ullman show have received 
critical praise but scant viewership 
on saturday the addition of the realitybased crime show 
cops has raised the nights ratings significantly its done 
for saturday night what americas most wanted did for sunday 
night said chernin 
fox ratings may be considerably lower than the networks but so 
are its expectations fox would consider a show with an 80 rating 
a major success a network show has to do about a 140 to be 
considered a keeper each rating point equals 904000 tv 
households 
i think the shows that work best for us are those that are 
attentiongetters said chernin there are numerous ways to get 
attention quality being innovative taking chances and using 
special talents we go after the younger audience and that goes 
handinhand because younger viewers are looking for new and 
innovative shows 
its takeachance attitude has resulted in publicity for 
certain the raunchy comedy married with children drew fire 
from a michigan woman who complained to sponsors who said they 
would review its content more carefully in the future but fox has 
no plans to alter the show which has sold out its advertising 
slots for the season 
other comedies under consideration for monday include lets 
get mom a domestic comedy starring carol kane a live halfhour 
comedy bill gets a life with comedian bill maher as a radio 
talkshow host babes a female buddy show about three rather 
large new york sisters hollywood dog a comedy combining live 
action and animation and urban renewal in the tradition of 
laughin and saturday night live from keenan ivory wayans 
besides the outsiders dramas being considered include the 
movie spinoff alien nation about an alien culture coexisting 
with humans and wurlitzer about a young man who discovers an 
old jukebox that acts as a time machine

a widely respected television journalist bill 
moyers is in a tussle with fundamentalist officials of his own 
denomination the southern baptists particularly one of them 
its a peculiar scrap and may lead to further rounds 
ive been a baptist all my life and im used to this moyers 
commented they say that where two or more baptists are gathered 
together therell be a fight 
this one was started by a virtually unheardof action a 
formally adopted resolution by a major denomination assailing an 
individual journalist it said moyers tv series god and 
politics was biased 
moyers says nobody can point to a single frame of that series 
and say its inaccurate 
we tried to be scrupulously fair and with the single exception 
of paul pressler the comments we have received from all sides have 
underlined that fairness 
pressler a houston judge was the chief strategist for 
fundamentalists gaining predominance in the countrys biggest 
protestant body elevating him to its national executive committee 
there he pushed through the resolution in february charging 
that the moyers series supported one faction the moderates 
in a decadelong conflict with the nowruling fundamentalist camp 
charging biased content the resolution urged people to 
complain to sponsors and the public broadcasting system that aired 
it more than a year before in december 1987 
why they waited so long is a mystery to me moyers said in 
an interview pressler now has the committee packed with his 
people so he can do whatever he wants 
pressler singled out a part of the series called battle for 
the bible dealing with the denominational controversy and 
called it prejudiced 
that show is to be repeated sunday may 21 on pbs as part of a 
series of moyers best documentaries he notified pressler of the 
reshowing in light of your spurious accusations and so 
viewers can once more judge it for themselves 
meyers invited pressler to appear with him following the program 
for a halfhour live discussion to say whatever he wants to say 
unedited 
however the executive committees chairman the rev charles 
sullivan of lenoir city tenn replied that pressler had been 
asked not to discuss the matter further publicly until the 
committee considered it 
the committee next meets just before the june 916 southern 
baptist convention in las vegas nev moyers earlier asked to 
appear before it to discuss these matters in a christian 
manner but sullivan also had turned that down saying there was 
no time on the agenda 
pressler at one point proposed a 90minute session with him 
taped by the denominations sunday school board provided it was 
shown in full on pbs something no independent producer could 
guarantee 
ironically while the jousting went on the national convention 
of the religious public relations council representing 
communications officers of most major denominations presented a 
special award to moyers for his high journalistic standards and 
sensitivity to religious values 
fundamentalists gained hegemony among the 148 million southern 
baptists through a strategy planned by pressler of electing 
successive convention presidents to use appointive powers to 
restrict personnel to biblical inerrantists or literalists 
baptists while always honoring the bible historically have 
resisted any official creed or control of interpretation 
most baptists dont realize whats been going on moyers 
said theyre too busy doing the lords work to pay any attention 
to denominational politics 
a key element in presslers complaint against moyers was that in 
a filmed interview moyers changed the questions from those to 
which pressler is shown responding 
moyers told baptist press paul pressler is not telling the 
truth 
pressler said that during the interview the only camera shots 
were full face of me but that moyers staff later recorded 
him asking new questions front face of him 
they were somewhat similar questions but had different 
nuances he said and brother it is not fair to haveyou 
appear like you are answering questions that were never asked 
moyers recounted of the interview as i began to ask him 
questions about his ties to rightwing politics and the beer man 
joseph coors he grew angry and flushed in the face abruptly stood 
up tore off his microphone announced the interview was over and 
left the room in a huff all of which we filmed but did not use in 
the commentary 
his unexpected departure meant that he was not present when 
as is customary we reversed the single camera and repeated the 
questions which my producer had taken down as the interview 
progressed but the content of the questions was unchanged 
as a matter of professional practice i do not treat my guests 
unfairly one would not survive in journalism and do so

the queen of soul reigned over 
her recent birthday party with the aloofness of a true monarch 
aretha franklin watched with detachment while guests dined on 
smoked salmon fresh fruit and chocolate fondue and danced to the 
music of two bands the furniture had been removed from her 
cavernous home in this affluent suburb to accommodate the 300 
friends 
it all resembled a medieval court transported to the 1980s 
dandies in black tie replaced knights in shining armor and 
madrigals gave way to rhythm and blues 
looking relatively svelte in a white suit with a black halter 
top the singer often stood alone surreptitiously puffing a 
cigarette still shy at 47 aretha franklin values privacy 
when im at home im just like the lady next door she said 
later in an interview i try to leave my act on stage i do my 
share of the dishes when im at home that helps keep my feet on 
the ground 
franklin rules over soul music like a personal fiefdom shes an 
icon who has influenced singers from chaka khan to bette midler 
she won her 15th grammy award this year for a collection of 
gospel songs and she is the biggest female grammy winner in 
history her albums and singles are multimillion sellers 
her home mirrors those achievements grammys line the mantel 
piece of her office gold and platinum records cover the walls 
some even sit on the floor because there is no place to hang them 
but franklin doesnt use her success to bully those around her 
we didnt have any ego battles said narada michael walden 
producer of whos zoomin who a platinum lp if she had been 
on her throne maybe but her throne is the peoples throne 
her constant quest for perfection is sometimes misinterpreted 
the producer said giving her the reputation as being difficult 
she works on instinct on spontaneity walden said shes 
a perfectionist in terms of the feeling of a song and sometimes 
shell keep doing it until she thinks its right 
franklin tries to avoid becoming totally immersed in her work 
outside the studio she attempts to stay fresh by doing things 
unrelated to music 
shes truly an excellent cook walden said she has a 
fighting spirit and she has to balance out her life and cooking is 
that release 
there is little time for cooking these days instead of food 
projects are simmering on all burners 
her new album through the storm features duets with elton 
john james brown and whitney houston she also plans to write her 
memoirs 
the book will contain several juicy tidbits said franklin 
whose life provides a lot of material 
her father was the rev cl franklin a civil rights activist 
and religious leader who also was prominent in gospel music 
circles aretha was born in memphis tenn her mother a gospel 
singer left when she was about six and franklin moved his family 
first to buffalo ny and then to detroit 
as a child aretha saw such luminaries as the nobelist martin 
luther king jr motown records founder berry gordy and pop star 
sam cooke in the franklins innercity detroit home 
her father was a popular electronic preacher who toured the 
country with appearances and made dozens of albums under his 
tutelage a shy and introverted aretha started singing gospel songs 
at an early age she quit school when she was about 14 to tour with 
him and made the live lp aretha gospel at his detroit 
church she signed her first recording contract with columbia 
records at 18 a discovery of the great record producer john 
hammond 
hammond who produced such artists as bob dylan bessie smith 
and bruce springsteen called franklin an untutored genius he 
said she was the best voice hed heard since billie holiday who he 
had also produced 
after some minor success with such songs as otis reddings try 
a little tenderness franklin moved to atlantic records in 1966 
a year later she exploded on the charts with her interpretation of 
his respect redding who died a few months later in a plane 
crash said he liked franklins version better than his own 
by 1969 she had forged an impressive chain of hits a natural 
woman chain of fools do right woman do right man i 
never loved a man the way i love you dr feelgood 
think 
her trademark twoocatave jumps impassioned bursts and gospel 
whoops made her something of a legend she moved with ease from 
soul to show tunes to popular standards but after her two most 
ambitious albums young gifted and black and spirit in the 
dark in the early 70s her career slowed she was still 
popular but the commercial success wasnt there 
and her personal life three marriages and an especially 
difficult divorce seemed to affect her musical life she left 
atlantic and moved to arista in 1980 where she has once again 
found the golden touch 
besides the book franklin would like to make a movie she had a 
cameo role in the john belushidan aykroyd movie the blues 
brothers in 1980 singing think 
her fear of flying and addiction to afternoon soap operas keep 
her home and off the road from noon until 330 in the afternoon 
nothing gets done in my home until the soaps are over she said 
for the past few years franklin has been taking a class to 
overcome her phobia but she still hasnt flown in december she 
gave a concert in atlantic city traveling to the new jersey resort 
by luxury bus 
it was fun the singer said it gave me a chance to see 
some of the country 
shes scheduled to sing there again may 2628 
the singer scoffs at the notion that her career is on the 
decline as some in the business have suggested i would say that 
my greatest accomplishment hasnt even happened yet im just a 
baby in the industry and im still learning 
but franklin is far from a toddler in the music business having 
taken giant steps since her humble beginnings as a gospel singer 
with little formal training shes achieved great success relying 
mostly on raw talent and taking her cue from such gospel greats as 
mahalia jackson and clara ward 
shes also been able to change with the times the raw emotion 
of her music in the 60s has been refined and slickly packaged 
with synthesizers and special audio effects to widen her appeal 
in the 80s 
early on such songs as respect snared rampb fans and she 
later won a pop audience with her tributes to judy garland and 
josephine baker in the 80s she grabbed the rockers with 
freeway of love and jump to it 
shes got a core following so shell always be popular 
said mary moore director of rhythm and blues publicity at arista 
but the new album should win over even more fans because of the 
duets like the one with whitney houston 
popularity is fine but as far as franklin is concerned 
theres no place like home my family is here and my roots are 
here 
the interview abruptly ended 
i have to check on the gumbo simmering on the stove said 
the queen of soul

agricultural progress has had many mileposts 
but none is more revered in the united states than the development 
of the landgrant institutions of higher learning and the extension 
system that carried knowledge to farmers 
seventyfive years ago on may 8 1914 the smithlever act was 
signed into law by president wilson creating an agriculture 
department agency to work with states counties and landgrant 
schools to get the latest word from classrooms and laboratories 
into the farthest reaches of rural america 
the federal role had already been important for decades it was 
the 1862 morrill act after all that initially endowed the 
landgrant institutions the silo techs and cow colleges 
by selling off 11 million acres of federal land 
the hatch act of 1887 provided funds for starting experiment 
stations at every landgrant school and in 1890 a second morrill 
act established black landgrant colleges in southern states 
in 1898 usda hired an iowan seaman a knapp to work in the 
south in louisiana knapp used a farm in each township to 
demonstrate the latest rice production methods to local farmers in 
1903 he set up demonstrations to reduce cotton boll weevil damage 
in louisiana and texas 
as knapps concepts of moving information from schools and 
experiment stations caught on new county agents were gradually 
added along with home demonstration agents and youth clubs which 
became 4h 
with private funds and local tax support augmenting limited usda 
funds the cooperative extension system grew by june 1918 during 
world war i 2435 counties had agricultural agents and 1715 had 
home demonstration agents working with usda to boost wartime food 
production 
by 1921 however the number of county units was cut back 
sharply as emergency war funds dried up in the 1930s extension 
agents were selected by usda to explain and interpret for farmers 
the new agricultural agencies and programs created to help them dig 
out of the depression 
through the years says usda historian doug bowers the 
extension system has remained a popular fixture among rural people 
before extension there had been lots of books written on 
agriculture and there had been agricultural societies which tended 
to be for gentlemen farmers for the most part bowers said in a 
telephone interview 
most farmers in the late 19th century and well into the 20th 
werent reached by scholarly books and papers written by 
professors farmers were slow to change their methods 
extension was a way to get down to the level of the farmer and 
reach him with the latest research bowers said it was the 
first time that had been done systematically 
as the county agents did their jobs farmers used technology to 
produce more food and fiber they were able to plow and plant more 
land they grew larger but fewer millions left the land and 
moved to the cities as technology and economics gripped rural 
america 
in the early 1900s there were more than 6 million farms in the 
united states today there are barely 2 million 
the problem has certainly shifted bowers said back 
around the turn of the century there were a lot of farmers who had 
very little idea of the research going on they werent terribly 
well educated so it was a matter of educating farmers about fairly 
basic things 
for example he said conservation wasnt much of a concern 
until the 1930s when dust storms and drought drew national 
attention to the plight of the nations soil 
so the typical county agent of 50 or 75 years ago was concerned 
with getting farmers to try new seeds fertilizer or a different 
way of tillage perhaps crop rotation was required or drainage or 
summer fallow improved livestock bloodlines animal nutrition new 
breeds of poultry and other innovations were introduced 
a recent usda pamphlet speaks of extension professionals in 
nearly all of the nations 3150 counties 
these days the extension service cites a number of national 
initiatives that are supposed to provide a new focus for 
extensions educational efforts those range from helping farmers 
find alternative agricultural opportunities to conservation and 
management of natural resources water quality diet and nutrition 
rural development are others 
has extension been so successful that it is no longer needed 
has it worked itself out of a job 
thats a queston thats much debated says historian bowers 
i dont think i could answer that 
myron johnsrud extension service administrator says there is 
plenty to do in remarks announcing this weeks kickoff of 
observances during the 75th anniversary year johnsrud said 
extensions mission now as it was in 1914 is to deliver 
researchbased information to people where they live and work 
critical issues facing americans including food safety water 
quality and youth at risk are at the top of the extension 
agenda he said 
and the tools of technology computers video satellites 
videodiscs are revolutionizing the way modern extension staffs 
deliver programs johnsrud said

the senate wandered into one of its guided 
detours the other day taken there as so often before by sen 
jesse helms of north carolina 
after a solo campaign failed to stop a bill to finance the 
martin luther king jr federal holiday commission helms succeeded 
in having the statuary rearranged 
he got the senate to order a replica of the declaration of 
independence returned to the capitol rotunda it been crowded out 
by a bust of king and moved to a hallway between the house and 
senate 
he also won a provision forbidding the king commission from 
promoting campaigns to protest social conditions or any form of 
civil disobedience the commission can send out material 
describing kings use of those tactics but it cant run 
howtodoit sessions as it apparently did at a student conference 
last year 
the focus of the argument was a bill providing 300000 for each 
of the next five years to the commission congress set up to promote 
observance of the king birthday holiday as sen sam nunn dga 
put it the object is to make that holiday more than just another 
threeday weekend for federal employees 
it is another threeday weekend of course and not only for 
federal workers all but five states now observe the king holiday 
along with many private businesses 
helms a conservative republican opposed the king holiday in 
the first place and he opposed funds for the commission it was 
set up in 1984 to encourage and assist activities appropriate to 
the memory of the slain civil rights pioneer 
the commission originally was supposed to get along without 
appropriated funds but supporters of the bill said private 
contributions arent sufficient any more 
the bill passed the senate 90 to 7 on tuesday a final version 
now will be negotiated with the house which had voted to make the 
commission permanent and give it 500000 a year 
i think the holiday should be so well instilled in peoples 
minds in five years that we will not need a permanent federal 
commission to promote it said nunn chief sponsor of the senate 
version 
hell be up for reelection in georgia next year helms term is 
expiring too 
a king bill and a debate that verged on civil rights even 
though that wasnt the issue had political potential on each 
side that certainly wasnt lost on other senators who delivered a 
series of setpiece speeches supporting the bill and praising king 
and his cause coretta scott king listened from the senate gallery 
while helms said he didnt want a debate about king he seemed 
bent on starting one those who believe him to have been a saint 
are entitled to their beliefs said helms i am obliged to say 
however that this senator fails to understand why if dr king had 
such an unblemished career the records on his career have been 
sealed by court order until after the turn of the century 
the debate had its moments 
one came when helms proposed an amendment urging that every 
member of congress who votes for the commission appropriation 
donate 1000 in personal funds to help finance it thats a 
gimmick he has tried before i think i got seven votes he 
recalled i got a lot of hard words this time he withdrew it 
without a vote 
the bill also illustrates the persistence of federal agencies 
no matter their size or mission 
the king commission originally was to have a brief run 
encouraging special events on the first of the holidays after 
that presumably people would know how to observe the holiday 
without advice while it was to have been done without federal 
funds the commission got the right to use staffers from other 
government agencies so far that and offices have cost about 23 
million 
helms said he was worried about precedent no other individual 
has a special commission to deal with his holiday he wondered 
where it would end 
nunn countered that there are too such commissions among them 
the one preparing for the 500th anniversary in 1992 of the voyage 
of christopher columbus granted said helms but that happens only 
twice a millennium and he voted against it anyhow 
i do not think we ought to spend the taxpayers money with a 
lot of folderol even though christopher columbus did a pretty good 
thing when he discovered america helms said

interested buyers have just one week to submit 
offers for striketorn eastern airlines following a ruling by a 
federal bankruptcy judge 
a new potential bidder emerged wednesday and another airline 
made a proposal to buy easterns lucrative northeast shuttle 
service 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland set a may 10 deadline 
for bidders to make offers for eastern in its entirety or for the 
shuttle at a price exceeding the 365 million that developer donald 
trump has agreed to pay for the business 
separately america west airlines inc said it offered to pay 
726 million for the shuttle routes and landing slots along with 
10 boeing 757 airliners raising the possibility of a bidding 
contest for that business 
eastern which has been largely grounded since a march 4 walkout 
by its machinists pilots and flight attendants unions has 
rejected several buyout proposals for the entire airline the 
company plans to reorganize as a smaller carrier and to raise about 
18 billion by selling aircraft and other assets 
lifland has been pushing to get the airline back to full 
operations as soon as possible at the same time he supports a 
sale of the entire company 
david shapiro the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner who 
recommended the oneweek deadline for proposals also asked for a 
may 17 hearing to evaluate any offers that had been made by then 
all sales of eastern assets must be approved by the federal 
bankruptcy court which is overseeing the airlines chapter 11 
reorganization 
shapiro also submitted a sealed report to the court on his 
investigation of past eastern financial transactions and other 
matters 
in a brief summary he concluded there were substantial 
conflicts of interest in the bankruptcy case because eastern and 
continental airlines are run as separate subsidiaries by the same 
management that of their parent texas air corp but in fact the 
airlines are rivals he said 
during wednesdays hearing an attorney disclosed that a group 
led by william howard the former chairman of piedmont airlines 
and the investment firm prudentialbache securities inc was 
interested in making a buyout proposal 
attorney lewis kaden said the howard group had been in 
discussions with eastern its creditors and unions and was willing 
to formulate an offer by this weekend kaden declined to give 
specifics of the offer but said it would include a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan he said the offer includes easterns shuttle 
service 
kaden said the howard group had been given confidential 
financial information already provided to billionaire hotel 
executive jay pritzker who also has submitted an offer 
shapiro said he was told by eastern the financial information 
also has been given to takeover strategist carl c icahn the owner 
and chairman of trans world airlines inc who previously expressed 
interest in eastern but twa general counsel mark buckstein told 
the associated press late wednesday i absolutely and 
unequivocally deny receiving any documents from eastern 
buckstein said twa requested the documents last thursday 
eastern and texas air have turned down a buyout offer from a 
group led by former baseball commissioner peter ueberroth plus 
proposals by pritzker and others that they said were not bona 
fide offers 
shapiro seemed to agree saying he was seeking a serious 
fleshedout real life offer and not some of the things i have been 
seeing over the past weeks 
in a statement from its phoenix headquarters america west 
indicated it would pay 390 million cash for the bostonnew 
yorkwashington shuttle with the balance of its offer to be paid 
in cash and by assumption of obligations related to the 10 757 
jetliners 
eastern has agreed to sell the shuttle along with 17 smaller 
older boeing 727s to trump but the deal has not been approved by 
the bankruptcy court 
bruce nobles president of trump shuttle the name the 
developer plans to use for the service said of the america west 
proposal we have no comment we dont know anything about it 
but he said we have a signed contract with eastern 
america west has indicated its interest in buying easterns

panamas economy is holding together 
more than a year after the united states imposed sanctions on the 
panamanian government but increasingly it is a handtomouth 
daytoday brand of surival 
the sanctions imposed in march and april of last year were 
intended to force the departure of gen manuel antonio noriega the 
de facto ruler of panama who has been indicted in the united states 
on drug trafficking charges 
noriega chief of the panamanian defense forces remains very 
much in charge as sundays presidential election approaches the 
united states and opposition figures accuse the government of 
planning to cheat to give noriegas candidate victory 
the sanctions froze about 56 million in panamanian government 
deposits in american banks and banned payments of taxes and some 
other fees to entities of the panamanian government 
the united states also is holding about 140 million in withheld 
panama canal payments in the name of eric delvalle deposed by 
noriega in march 1988 and still recognized by the united states as 
the president of panama 
bank deposits here are down sharply huge sums have left the 
country savings accounts remain frozen and a shortage of cash has 
cut sharply into loan availability which means new development and 
construction are way down 
ironically the survival of the economy is due in considerable 
part to what the united states and us businesses spend here 
about 500 million a year not counting the military payroll for 
10000 southern command troops and payrolls and expenditures of 
several large american companies 
the businesses include a texaco refinery the transpanama oil 
pipeline and the cherokee land co a bananagrowing concern that 
continues to export bananas but because of the sanctions does not 
pay the government export taxes of about 1 million a month 
the 500 million most of it related to the panama canal is 
about 12 percent of panamas gross domestic product a large share 
of that could be lost to panama if the united states further 
tightens the sanctions 
the government is blaming nearly all of its problems on the 
sanctions although the economic decline actually started in 
mid1987 when panamanians worried about political instability 
started sending money out of the country 
by panamanian government figures the gross domestic product 
dropped about 171 percent in 1988 from 5 billion to about 41 
billion american economists contend only about a fourth of the 
drop is due to the sanctions 
between june of 1987 and december of 1988 internal bank deposits 
were down from 44 billion to 28 billion indicating capital 
flight of about 16 billion 
time deposits have been frozen and speculators have done a brisk 
business buying them up for cash at a discount in hopes they 
eventually will be released 
panama which uses the american dollar has no central bank and 
cannot print more money unless it establishes its own currency 
which then would be subject to heavy inflationary pressures 
in a statement published wednesday the governments national 
banking commission said the situation had hit bottom and was 
starting to improve slightly especially with foreign deposits in 
panamanian banks 
but the commission said the banking system has a long way to go 
before returning to where it was before the crisis 
it still is necessary to increase the availability of loan 
funds in banks and this can be achieved if we panamanians keep our 
funds in banks in panama it said 
it predicted that the opposition will refuse to accept defeat in 
sundays presidential election and resort to violence and for that 
reason the commission could not assure that savings accounts would 
be freed in june as had been predicted 
unemployment in panama is put at about 20 percent but that 
figure does not take into account the partial employment and 
underemployment brought about by sanctionrelated stagnation 
normally in latin america repatriation of capital flight follows 
a period of political stability something panama may not see for a 
time panama has suspended payment of its considerable domestic and 
foreign debt which once took about 40 percent of the national 
budget 
a panamanian government assessment of damages from the 
sanctions published in february said 778 million in loan 
agreements and donations for development projects had been 
cancelled by the us agency for international development 
the governments income was down 44 percent the study said the 
number of panamanians below the poverty line it said has risen 
from about 33 percent to 40 percent

the aflcio urged a bankruptcy judge to order 
strikecrippled eastern airlines sold condemning its current 
owners for treating the carrier as a fiscal carcass to be picked 
over for the benefit of other corporate entities 
the 14 millionmember labor federations governing body also 
promised wednesday continued support for easterns striking 
machinists union and the flight attendants and pilots who have 
honored pickets saying their solidarity in the twomonth strike 
has won the admiration of the entire labor movement 
the statement was issued by the aflcio executive council as the 
bankruptcy court in new york held a hearing on whether eastern 
should be sold in its entirety the judge set a oneweek deadline 
for potential buyers to make proposals 
easterns owner texas air corp has insisted none of several 
offers for the airline is workable and proposed a plan to shrink 
eastern that it says would allow the airline to emerge from 
bankruptcy the plan includes selling about 18 billion in eastern 
assets 
the aflcio said texas air chairman frank lorenzo has engaged in 
systematic milking of easterns assets to feed other sectors of 
his texas air corp and said his mismanagement has literally 
run the airline into the ground 
leaders of easterns unions briefed the executive council before 
the statement was issued and pledged to work with new management 
should the airline be sold 
the aflcio has raised more than 12 million in strike aid for 
the eastern unions and promised to continue fundraising and other 
support efforts until the strike is concluded

maria troy penniless and far from home found 
both a motel room and a job through a national motel chains 
program to help the homeless 
roughly about 35 percent of the hotel rooms in the united 
states go empty every night on an average said mike leven 
president and chief operating officer of atlantabased days inn of 
america and certainly other businesses could do the same kind of 
housing training and rehabilitation that weve done 
ms troy and her 9yearold son john were among the first 10 
to 15 people helped by the program they had spent two months in a 
shelter for the homeless before ms troy was given a job taking 
reservations at days inn of america headquarters she and her son 
moved into a motel owned by a days inn franchisee 
the two had been in the united states about two years since 
leaving mexico and did not have enough money to rejoin ms troys 
family there 
they finally went home last month in an interview before their 
departure ms troy said days inn made her feel like im not just 
an employee or a computer im a human being 
so far the program has been limited to the atlanta area where 
an estimated 10000 people are homeless 
participants often work in reservations where they make 450 
to 550 an hour plus incentives they are provided rooms at half 
the normal rate of 20 a day with days inn making up the 
difference to the franchisee 
we do it through a payroll deduction leven said theyre 
able to get a decent place to stay they pay 50 percent of it from 
their wages and we pay the other 50 percent and then theyre 
rehabilitated into the work force and trained and put into work 
some of them have already been promoted and left our jobs for 
better jobs 
ms troy had been promoted from reservations to a position 
involving tours and special packages before she left 
happily maria reached a point where she could make a choice 
and do what she felt was best for her said carol bivins the 
motel chains vice president of public relations 
in washington michele kelley of the american hotel and motel 
association said she knew of no other such programs in the lodging 
industry 
i think were going to see it more and more from the public in 
general that theyre going to do more for the homeless because 
its such an issue ms kelley said 
leven started the program in february 1988 after being asked to 
visit a homeless shelter with the idea of possibly making a 
donation 
mike leven spent one evening at the shelter and turned around 
and said why dont we do something that will really make a 
difference why dont we do something that really will employ some 
of the homeless ms bivins said 
a days inn job meant the end of life in a shelter for delores 
smith 31 and her three children ranging from 16 months to 12 
years old 
ms smith who spent about three months in a homeless shelter 
last year before she joined the days inn program came to atlanta 
from colorado looking for work 
i had been seeking work for a long time she recalled 
every day i would go out and i would fill out applications and 
nobody ever responded 
a cashiers job she had briefly didnt work out and in april 
1988 she entered the shelter 
that was the end of my hope she said 
she recalled that a woman at the shelter just looked at me and 
said i dont think you want to be in here would you like a job 
she asked if i could type i said yes she got me in contact with 
days inn 
she chose to stay at the shelter briefly and then found an 
apartment working but never living in a days inn 
i have a lot of confidence in myself now ms smith said 
i think theres a lot of people out there who just need a 
chance ms smith said thats what they gave me they gave me 
a chance ive been working i feel like ill be somebody

cosmetics maker avon products inc has rebuffed 
takeover feelers from amway corp and investor irwin l jacobs and 
says it isnt entertaining any offers 
minneapolisbased jacobs and rival direct selling company amway 
told the securities and exchange commission on wednesday that they 
hold about 557 million of avons 5388 million shares outstanding 
or about 103 percent they also purchased options to buy 40000 
shares on april 5 for 125 to 2 a piece 
most of the shares were bought from april 3 to may 2 for prices 
ranging from 23 to 3228 each the partners disclosed in a 
document submitted to the sec 
the aj partnership formed by the two said avon stock seems 
undervalued and they might buy more shares from time to time the 
partners may make a merger proposal to avon but no decision has 
been reached they said in the sec filing in response avon 
chairman and chief executive officer james preston issued a 
statement declaring we want to make it clear that avon is not 
for sale 
avon stock gained 475 in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading wednesday closing at 3687 in heavy volume the price 
surpassed its previous 52week high of 3250 
at that price if the partners were to buy all avon common stock 
and equivalents they dont own the cost would total about 24 
billion 
avon is widely known as a doortodoor distributor of 
toiletries fragrances and household products made famous by its 
avon lady ad campaigns of years past but much of avons 
revenue now comes from workplace and telephone orders avon has 
been moving toward more direct marketing via mailings 
the new yorkbased company has been realigning its operations to 
focus on its beauty businesses after a largely unsuccessful foray 
into the health care services industry avon sold or is in the 
process of selling its nursing homes retirement living facilities 
and alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers 
preston stated that avon has been improving its profitability 
and stockholders would be better off if avon pursues its current 
objectives avon had sales of 306 billion in 1988 and lost 4045 
million mainly due to the cost of getting out of the health care 
services industry 
we believe that avon can provide the best value to its 
shareholders by remaining independent preston said our 
strategies have resulted in the strong sales and profit growth of 
our beauty business for the last three years 
avon has been the subject of takeover talk for some time most 
recently last week after unilevers planned acquisition of the 
faberge and elizabeth arden toiletries cosmetics and fragrance 
lines fell through 
there has been speculation that unilever a huge european 
personal products conglomerate would turn its attention on other 
cosmetics concerns and avon has been mentioned by wall street 
analysts as a possibility 
avon owns several properties that unilever which has said it 
would like to increase its interests in expensive or prestige 
items might find appealing among avons prestige products are the 
fragrances red and giorgio and actress chers uninhibited scent 
the financial markets have bid up avon stock on the hunch that a 
suitor might come calling 
amway based in ada mich was founded about 30 years ago and 
is closely held by jay van andel and richard devos it has become 
the secondlargest direct sales firm after avon and says it has 
more than 1 million distributors vs avons 1475 million 
independent sales representatives worldwide 
telephone calls to amway seeking comment on its intentions were 
not returned 
calls to jacobs also went unreturned he has had experience with 
the direct sales business as the owner of watkins products co a 
personal products company which uses the doortodoor technique

automakers incentives appear to be working some 
magic as sales during april bounced back from levels a month 
before and a year earlier but the pace may taper off in may 
last months vehicle sales ran 76 percent ahead of last aprils 
pace the eight major automakers with us plants reported 
wednesday 
but during april 2130 the carmakers said their car and light 
truck sales were down 07 percent falling to an average daily rate 
of 46394 compared with a rate of 46736 during the same time last 
year 
the industry was focused on april sales after the nations big 
three automakers introduced new incentive packages at the beginning 
of the month that were designed to inject some adrenalin into the 
sluggish sales recorded in march 
march sales created fears that the market was drying up and 
april sales figures reversed that said analyst scott merlis of 
morgan stanley amp co of new york 
the results of the incentives have been gratifying for us 
said robert rewey vice president for north american sales for ford 
motor co 
in april ford cornered 303 percent of the usmade car 
market compared with 459 percent for general motors corp and 
133 percent for chrysler corp in april 1988 ford held 286 
percent of the same market gm had 483 percent and chrysler 
accounted for 146 percent 
typically automakers let their inventories build during the 
first two months of the year in anticipation of active sales during 
march and april as americans prepare to take to the road during 
summer vacations and weekend trips 
automakers with us plants reported a sales rate of 37708 
vehicles during march of this year 103 percent behind the rate 
for april giving an indication that the incentives were working 
i think the incentives have spurred people in here said 
jack adler sales manager of galles chevroletgeo in albuquerque 
nm 
april sales reduced inventory merlis said they showed 
that incentives at least worked a little and there is no sign of a 
downward spiral 
automakers became concerned about their inventories in march 
when softerthanexpected sales coupled with ambitious production 
schedules expanded inventories 
to counter that and to entice buyers gm ford and chrysler a 
month ago introduced such new incentive programs as low financing 
and cash rebate offers the ford program expires may 31 gms runs 
out june 5 and chryslers are in effect indefinitely 
despite the yeartoyear sales increase in april the rate was 
disappointing to tom webb a senior economist for the national 
automobile dealers association in mclean va 
i think it implies that the underlying demand is much weaker 
than most people expected he said i think theyre either 
going to have to do something to spur sales or enact further 
production cuts 
there has been speculation that the manufacturers will take 
longer than usual in the late summer and early autumn to prepare 
factories for the 1990 models some of which already are in 
showrooms such a move could further reduce 1989 inventories 
but merlis said wednesdays figures might defuse that 
speculation 
april sales obviate the need for wholesale production cuts 
he said although i think well have a normal cyclical cooldown 
this year april suggests that sales are not falling off a cliff

as slogans go the heartful food with a harmony 
taste lacks the gusto of drag it through the garden but a 
japanese company is hoping it will strike the right chord with 
tokyo office workers hungry for a taste of chicago 
the product is the chicagostyle hot dog an allbeef weiner 
with tomatoes onions mustard relish cucumbers jalapeno peppers 
and celery salt in a poppyseed bun 
chicago foods corp a tokyobased company formed by the japan 
tobacco co the kitoku rice co and yonekyu meatprocessing 
company plans to open the first chicago hot dogs stand in tokyo in 
july with managers trained in a chicagoarea hotdog restaurant 
richard portillo the local entrepreneur who struck the deal 
with chicago foods said he hopes chicagostyle hot dogs will be as 
big a hit in japan as mcdonalds hamburgers which are available at 
more than 650 locations 
nobodys taken a concept like the hot dog and tried to do 
something like this in japan portillo said wednesday in a 
telephone interview from his car which has license plates reading 
topdog1 
actually the japanese can already buy something called a hot 
dog but its a far cry from the hefty handful available in chicago 
the asian fastfood chain lotteria sells a version consisting of 
spiced meat chunks in a casing and sausages coated with batter and 
deepfried are popular festival fare 
but the chicagostyle dog is another breed altogether said paul 
chang a chineseborn americaneducated chicago foods employee who 
is learning the hot dog business from portillo 
we call it a harmony taste he said from end to end of 
bun you can have the same flavor at any bite 
chang said chicago foods advertising will also reflect their 
products heritage 
in the midwest you call this place the heartland right so 
we call this food heartful food heartful food with a harmony 
taste 
portillo whose 11 namesake restaurants dot chicagos western 
suburbs reached an agreement in august to teach the japanese 
company the secrets of his success 
he said chicago foods selected his company as a model after 
scouring the country for a chain offering a uniquely american food 
the japanese company sent chang and three other prospective 
restaurant managers to the chicago area this spring for eight weeks 
of training at portillos restaurant in naperville they will 
return to japan later this month 
if all goes well with its first two outlets in tokyo chicago 
foods plans to open 70 restaurants within three years said 
portillo who will receive a percentage of the companys sales for 
20 years 
portillo said he also received a large fee up front but he 
would not disclose the amount he said his chicago restaurants had 
sales of more than 20 million last year 
chang said he eats hot dogs every day usually with the works 
while the training groups leader takashi kogahara prefers only 
onions tomatoes and cucumbers 
in japan he said chicago foods may add grilled onions and 
shredded lettuce to the list of condiments

helping people figure out how much to 
pay uncle sam paid off for hampr block inc this year 
the company prepared 13090000 tax returns worldwide according 
to preliminary figures released wednesday by the kansas citybased 
firm 
that was an increase of 526000 or 42 percent from 1988 the 
returns accounted for 6309 million in taxes 
the figures bucked a trend in the taxpreparation business the 
company said usually fewer people use tax preparers in the second 
year after taxoverhaul legislation is enacted said donald ayers 
blocks vice president for finance 
after the tax reform act of 1986 went into effect block had a 
record increase in the number of tax returns it prepared ayers 
said but the company had expected trouble this year 
in the first year after tax reform we always have a boost in 
business because people are confused ayers said but in the 
second year the numbers decrease because many people go back to 
selfpreparation 
block and its franchises operate more than 8700 taxpreparation 
offices worldwide

us rep bob carr and wayne county officials 
oppose a debt financed buyout of northwest airlines parent 
company fearing it could ground expansion plans at detroit 
metropolitan airport 
were fighting for our lives wayne county executive ed 
mcnamara said wednesday 
northwest and takeover specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
declined to comment wednesday on a wall street journal report that 
kkr with access to 413 million in michigan pension funds might 
bid for the airline 
marvin davis who bid 27 million for the parent company nwa 
inc in march has agreed to a truce in his proxy fight for 
control of nwa 
michigan has committed 413 million to kkr from five state 
employee pension funds since 1982 kkr has drawn 171 million and 
the state has realized a 40 percent return on the investment a 
state department of treasury spokesman said 
kkr has agreed to study any michiganbased company trying to 
resist a takeover but has said it would emerge as a white 
knight only if that would be profitable 
kkr would have to formally request any state funds wanted for a 
northwest takeover the treasury department spokesman said 
northwest is the largest airline at metro airport and would pay 
the biggest share of costs of a planned expansion 
mcnamara said wayne county lawyers will file a lawsuit friday 
aimed at blocking the sale of nwa inc to anyone who would finance 
the acquisition with huge amounts of debt 
a county contract with the airline bars a takeover or merger 
that reduces nwas net worth he said 
carr said in washington he would introduce a bill next week to 
require the us department of transportation to examine airline 
buyouts more closely 
the bill would prohibit the sales if high debts from the buyout 
threatened to compromise safety or the carriers ability to 
operate said carr a member of the house appropriations 
committees transportation subcommittee

the countrys biggest store chains today posted varied april 
sales tallies and analysts said more springlike weather in the 
latter half of the month spurred seasonal purchases partly 
compensating for earlier weakness 
softness in sales at several big general retailers reflected 
slower economic activity due to costlier debt burdens and inflation 
worries analysts said 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co said sales 
on an industrywide basis this year have barely outpaced the 
inflation rate indicating that consumer spending a key element in 
economic growth is easing feiner has scaled down his forecast for 
average 1989 retail sales growth to 55 percent from 6 percent 
based on sales results so far this year 
nonetheless analysts found some signs in the april figures 
indicating that shopping momentum is picking up particularly for 
womens clothing and seasonal goods 
thomas tashjian an analyst with seidler amdec securities inc 
in los angeles said retail business was only soso in the first 
two weeks of april 
but it became better once temperatures turned warm enough to 
remind people they needed new spring and summer clothing 
doityourself gadgetry patio furniture and other outdoor gear 
the arrival of spring weather was the main theme said 
tashjian 
furthermore most big retailers waited out the sluggish period 
rather than engaging in widespread price cutting to attract 
customers easing the impact on their profit margins tashjian said 
todays results were from some of the biggest general 
merchandise chains in the united states plus apparel retailers 
monthly retail sales figures from the government are more 
comprehensive and include the take at other types of establishments 
such as auto dealerships supermarkets and restaurants 
sears roebuck and co the nations biggest retailer said its 
lowprice policy introduced earlier this year continued attracting 
shoppers 
chicagobased sears said its sales rose 92 percent to 25 
billion in the 4 weeks ended april 29 from 229 billion sales at 
stores open at least a year called same or comparable store sales 
rose 68 percent 
retailers and industry analysts consider samestore sales a more 
accurate indication of a companys performance than totals that 
include sales at newly opened stores not every retailer reports 
samestore sales 
sears sales through the first quarter of its financial year came 
to 762 billion up 112 percent from the 1988 first quarter 
figure of 685 billion 
k mart corp the secondlargest general retailer based in 
troy mich said sales gains in the second half of april at its 
outdoor garden shop home improvement and ladies apparel 
departments only partially offset weakness in the first two weeks 
of the month 
k marts sales in the four weeks ended april 26 totaled 205 
billion up 23 percent from april 1988s 201 billion on a 
samestore basis though k marts sales fell 1 percent 
sales at k mart through the first quarter came to 607 billion 
up 39 percent from 584 billion 
here are some of the other results 
walmart stores inc the discounter based in bentonville ark 
said its sales rose 25 percent in april to 198 billion from 158 
billion its samestore sales were up 11 percent for the month 
sales at walmarts through the first quarter were 537 billion 
up 25 percent over 428 billion in 1988s first quarter 
dallasbased jc penney co inc said its sales amounted to 
106 billion in the four weeks ended april 29 up 93 percent from 
966 million a year earlier on a comparable store basis april 
sales were up 67 percent 
for the first quarter penneys sales came to 31 billion a 
47 percent increase from 297 billion in 1988 
fw woolworth co based in new york said its domestic sales 
increased 111 in april 29 to 348 million from 313 million 
samestore sales gained 67 percent 
for woolworths year to date domestic sales totaled 112 
billion up 77 percent from 104 billion 
limited incs 4week sales were 307 million up 22 percent 
from 2511 million in the 1988 period comparable store sales rose 
18 percent 
for the first quarter of 1989 limiteds sales rose to 9466 
million up 19 percent from 8111 million the specialty apparel 
retailer is based in columbus ohio 
carter hawley hale stores inc based in los angeles reported 
april sales of 1903 million up 31 percent from 1845 million 
in the corresponding 1988 period samestore sales rose 22 percent

the public agency that manages alaskas 
10 billion oilwealth savings account will send a message to exxon 
corp at its annual meeting by withholding 650600 shares of exxon 
stock from voting 
the alaska permanent fund corp sent a letter to exxon chairman 
lawrence rawl this week informing him of the largely symbolic 
action to underscore alaskas concern over the exxon valdez oil 
spill in prince william sound 
this incident has brought incredible devastation to regions of 
this state and will have longlasting consequences wrote oral e 
freeman chairman of the permanent fund board 
freeman urged rawl to take all necessary and appropriate 
action to insure that the oil spill is dealt with fully and in a 
timely matter 
the permanent fund is a state trust created in 1976 to ensure 
that alaska residents benefit from the states oil wealth long 
after the oil is gone 
the funds investment in exxon is the second largest of its 
stock portfolio and is worth more than 281 million however it 
represents only a small percentage of the total shares of exxons 
outstanding stock 
withholding the shares at exxons annual meeting may 18 in 
parsippany nj will mean the votes they represent cannot be used 
to establish a quorum or for any vote of the stockholders 
exxon spokesman dave parish said exxon officials had not seen 
freemans letter and would have no comment 
fund board member byron i mallott chief executive officer of 
sealaska corp suggested the board take the action he said it 
probably would have no major effect on the meeting other than to 
make a point 
this is one way that corporations speak to one another 
mallott said we wanted to make a responsible statement without 
being negative without casting any kinds of aspersions but we 
also wanted to make it clear how seriously we consider the 
circumstances that exxon has essentially placed the state of alaska 
in 
freeman said in his letter that he hopes exxon will meet its 
responsibility to clean up the spill and that the permanent fund 
will be able to vote its shares in subsequent annual meetings 
the boards action tuesday was unanimous mallott also said 
sealaska corp one of 13 regional native corporations established 
under the alaska native claims settlement act was withholding its 
2600 exxon shares from voting

the typical american household nearly six 
members strong when the nation was new is down statistically to 
just over 2 people a record low the census bureau said thursday 
the decline reflects changes in the age structure of the 
american population said census bureau demographer campbell 
gibson in a telephone interview 
the household is shrinking as families have fewer children more 
young people set up housekeeping on their own and the number of 
elderly maintaining their own households grows 
there were 915 million households in the country as of last 
july 1 the bureau said with an average population of 262 people 
each 
that was down from 264 people a year earlier and 275 people in 
the 1980 census as the number of households in the country 
continues to grow faster than the population as a whole 
from 1980 to 1988 the number of households increased 139 
percent while the population rose 85 percent 
back in 1790 the first national census found that the typical 
household contained 579 people 
that was a time of extended families and generations living 
together circumstances which have become less common over time 
more than anything else sid gibson decline in fertility 
has had an impact on household size 
between 1980 and 1987 the proportion of the total population 
under age 18 dropped from 281 percent to 26 percent he said 
the nations birth rate fell from 182 births per 1000 people 
in 1970 to 156 in 1987 
in recent years there has been an increase in the total number 
of births largely a result of the giant baby boom generation being 
in its prime childbearing years 
however this generation is still reproducing at a lower rate 
than the parents resulting in fewer children per household 
total births are still nowhere near what they were in the 
decade following world war ii gibson said 
this decline in young people is reflected in the maturing of 
americas population a change emphasized on wednesday with a 
separate census bureau report showing that the nations median age 
has risen to 323 years its highest level ever 
at the other end pulling up the age are members of the 
postworld war ii baby boom generation moving into middle age and 
the growing number of elderly americans whose lives have been 
extended by improved medical care 
with better health more and more elderly maintain households on 
their own either as couples or alone rather than living with 
children or in group homes for older people or nursing homes 
for example in 1970 about 5 million people aged 65 and over 
lived alone while by 1987 that had risen to 85 million 
in addition many young people continue to set up housekeeping 
on their own rather than forming families as they pursue education 
and careers 
in 1987 there were 65 million persons aged 25 to 44 living 
alone compared with just 16 million in 1970 census studies show 
gibson discounted the effect of the rise in divorce and 
separation on household size however commenting that detailed 
statistics are not available to determine this result 
for example a divorced couple may form two smaller households 
may remarry or one or both may go to live with parents or others 
familyoriented utah was the only state with an average 
household size of more than three at 317 the bureau reported 
florida and oregon had the smallest average household size at 246 
the household measure counts the number of persons residing in a 
single housing unit this can be a single person living alone or 
any number of people sharing the home the size of a household is 
usually slightly smaller than that of a family since it includes 
single people while a family must include at least two related 
individuals

years

a group of new england investors has filed a 
classaction lawsuit seeking to regain tens of thousands of dollars 
from blinder robinson amp co a denver pennystock brokerage 
the suit filed in us district court in hartford conn 
claims the nine investors were defrauded in 1988 when they 
purchased mortgagebacked securities known as fannie maes the 
securities were bought on margin and brought heavy losses to the 
investors according to the lawsuit 
a preliminary hearing in which the investors are seeking 
600000 from blinder robinson to cover their known damages is 
set for wednesday in hartford 
teresa leahy of old greenwich conn said she and her husband 
lost more than 15000 in the investment program it hurt because 
were on social security she said it takes a long time to get 
that together 
the investors said they were told by salesmen for blinder 
robinson that they could make 40 percent to 60 percent profits in 
three years with little risk however their investments were sold 
in less than a year with substantial losses 
blinder robinson attorney alan jacobson responded to the suit 
thursday saying our impression is there is no factual or legal 
basis for this lawsuit jacobson said the brokerage does not 
believe in litigating cases in the media each investor signed an 
arbitration agreement and such agreements are considered private 
i do not think very highly of people who dont honor their 
contracts or of attorneys who run to the media 
officials of the federal national mortgage association wrote to 
the brokerage last year warning that it was failing to adequately 
explain the risks involved in such securities and was exaggerating 
yields fannie mae is a governmentchartered corporation that buys 
and sells mortgages on the secondary market 
no specific claims of overall monetary damages were cited in the 
lawsuit because the amount could increase as more investors join 
the action said attorney richard weinstein 
a federal judge still must rule on whether the lawsuit may 
continue as a class action

western savings and loan association which wiped 
out the equity of its shareholders and fell below regulatory 
capital guidelines at the end of 1988 on thursday reported a 998 
million firstquarter loss 
the loss compares with one of 19 million for the first three 
months of last year 
it marks the second straight heavy quarterly loss for the 
thrift which has shrunk by 602 million in deposits and 773 
million in assets since march 31 1988 
chairman robert w stallings who took over april 3 said 
continuing additions to real estate loanloss reserves pushed the 
thrift into another loss 
depositors should not worry he said because of the federal 
deposit insurance corps standard guarantee on the first 100000 
of deposits in each account 
however he noted that the quarterly loss reduced westerns 
regulatory net worth to 99 million that is about 17 percent of 
liabilities and less than half of what federal regulators have said 
western should maintain for stability

donald j trump a consummate 
player in the highstakes world of big business was the new game 
in town thursday as he toured milton bradley co to herald new 
editions of trump the game 
women workers screeched as he passed by and one cried when he 
bussed her on the cheek he kissed me he kissed me said a 
shaky grace adams of springfield mass who has worked 31 years at 
the company 
the real estate mogul flew to the western massachusetts factory 
of 2300 workers in the huge black trump helicopter to fulfill a 
promise to the company that expects trump the game to be the 
biggest seller in its 129year history despite its 25 pricetag 
they were intent on having me come up to meet the real 
people trump said these are the people doing the work to 
hell with the executives 
employees clapped at each stop in the 45minute visit women 
sighed isnt he handsome and men lined up for autographs on 
the paper money that bears his likeness and comes in denominations 
no smaller than 10 million 
more than 2 million games are scheduled for production by years 
end it is the no 1 seller in the 300 stores that have received 
advance copies milton bradley president george ditomassi said 
neither the company nor trump will disclose his royalties but 
both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the homeless and 
for research on aids cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis 
the board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first 
bid against each other using trump cards of course for 
airlines casinos luxury hotels and other trump properties then 
try to negotiate deals 
if you dont do well at this game you should stay on 
9to5 trump advised adding that the game is tough even for a 
veteran like him 
but he resisted explaining its appeal if i said it youd say 
i have a big ego so why say it 
although several game manufacturers tried to peddle their ideas 
to trump the one that caught his eye came from an independent 
inventor from chicago who suggested milton bradley as a 
manufacturer 
trump said he settled on the nations largest board game maker 
because the loyalty decisiveness and professionalism of this 
company is just unbelievable as the applause died down he 
barked at workers ok get some overtime 
trump later denied rumors that he planned to run for mayor of 
new york which had surfaced with a recent fullpage newspaper ad 
he took out supporting the death penalty 
and he sneered at the suggestion that a new bidder for 
strikebound eastern airlines northeast shuttle could affect his 
365 million offer for the service its not serious he said 
of wednesdays bid from regional carrier america west airlines i 
have not even heard of them 
besides trump said his contract with eastern guarantees him a 
lot of money even if the deal falls through theyll pay me a 
fairly substantial amount of money and ill go home he said 
but i would rather get it 
under the contract trump would receive 8 million from eastern 
if the deal isnt consummated according to sources close to the 
situation 
trump declined to jibe at cartoonist garry trudeau for the comic 
series that depicted him as a mogul with an overriding ego i 
think its an honor he said garry trudeau is a talented guy

the coauthor of a 1972 law that curbed 
american trade with the soviet union called on president bush and 
congress today to waive the restriction for one year to encourage 
further improvements in human rights under mikhail s gorbachev 
the process under way appears to be in earnest said charles 
a vanik a former democratic congressman from ohio who sponsored 
the law with the late sen henry m jackson dwash that is 
designed to force increased jewish emigration 
vaniks plea was endorsed by meyer berger a member of the board 
of the national conference on soviet jewry he said a waiver would 
help stabilize ussoviet relations and send a message that 
american jews recognize the great change in the human rights 
process under gorbachev 
the board is due to take up the question of us trade 
restrictions at a meeting here next month berger of pittsburgh 
said he was not speaking for the board 
the law known as jacksonvanik denied the soviet union the 
trading privileges accorded most nations unless jews were allowed 
to emigrate freely 
last month 4557 jews left the highest monthly figure since 
october of 1979 the year emigration reached an annual high of 
51320 
vanik projected an exodus this year of 38000 to 43000 he had 
called for a waiver which is permitted under the law in 1979 as 
well 
besides increased jewish emigration the former congressman 
cited a pledge by soviet president gorbachev to abolish all laws 
restricting religious and cultural practices 
we cannot expect instant democracy he said in a speech at a 
luncheon sponsored by the american committee on ussoviet 
relations a private group that seeks reconciliation between the 
superpowers we must measure progress in the soviet union from 
ground zero 
vanik placed himself between proponents of outright repeal of 
the law and hardliners in congress who he said will resist 
any accommodation with the soviet union 
he said only about a dozen countries are denied what is known 
technically as mostfavored nation trading status these 
include albania cuba czechoslovakia laos and romania 
vanik said trade with iran and south africa is only partially 
impeded 
even colombia the south american country vanik said is the 
major drug supplier to the united states enjoys 
mostfavorednation privileges he said 
berger said a waiver would improve trade and also boost 
emigration providing israel with skilled russian immigrants he 
said it also might facilitate the resumption of diplomatic 
relations between jerusalem and moscow 
martin a wenick executive director of the jewish group said 
at a news conference earlier that in reassessing its position on 
jacksonvanik the board would consider various factors 
he said these included whether visas were issued to some 600 
longterm refusenik families jews waiting for years for 
permission to emigrate

the detroit free press parent company thursday 
affirmed its commitment to the newspaper and to pursuing a 
longstalled joint operating agreement with the detroit news 
we are firmly committed to continue to publish an excellent 
and competitive newspaper in detroit knightridder inc 
president james batten said in a thursday news release 
when the us supreme court decided monday to hear a challenge 
of the joa with a decision expected next year some analysts 
wondered if miamibased knightridder would be willing to absorb 
the free press losses for another year 
but the companys board of directors thursday unanimously agreed 
to continue publishing the newspaper while the appeal is pending 
although we are disappointed by the delay necessitated by the 
supreme courts decision to review the case we remain confident 
that the court will affirm the actions of the attorney general and 
the lower courts batten said 
the free press and the news the latter owned by gannett co 
inc have sought the partial merger since 1986 the papers aim to 
cut costs by combining advertising circulation and production 
operations while keeping separate news and editorial departments 
the free press lost 227 million in 1988 knightridder said in 
the statement gannett hasnt released annual loss figures but has 
said the news lost 6495 million from 1980 through 1987 
while the joa ruling is pending the free press will try to keep 
its losses to 1988 levels knightridder said 
and in concert with the news it will reopen contract 
negotiations at once with both newspapers unions more than 3000 
union employees have gone without contractual raises since 1986 
knightridder has said it would close the free press if the joa 
were denied

american engineers builders suppliers and 
development experts have an opportunity to earn some of the 
trillions of yen japan plans to pour into overseas economic aid in 
the coming years us aid chief alan woods said thursday 
japan about to replace the united states as the worlds largest 
foreign aid donor is interested in making use of us expertise 
woods head of the us agency for international development told 
reporters 
britain has already responded to the japanese desire for expert 
collaboration and the british have become procurement agents for 
the japanese aid agency throughout east africa he said 
woods announced that aid is sponsoring conferences in san 
francisco may 10ll and orlando florida may 1516 to help 
american enterprises on the pacific and atlantic coasts learn about 
opportunities in the japanese overseas development program 
officials from three japanese aid agencies will participate in both 
meetings the first such sessions ever held he said 
the japanese have only about 200 foreign aid specialists and 
appear eager to draw on the experience of more than 2000 americans 
working on aid programs woods said 
there is no formal agreement on collaboration between the two 
countries agencies woods said in answer to a question but 
foreign participation in japanesefinanced programs outside japan 
is governed by conditions different from those for japanese 
domestic projects where difficult negotiations were held last year 
to gain access for us contractors he added 
in japanese foreign aid the receiving country has the 
responsibility for organizing competitive bidding on projects it 
was pointed out 
japan plans to spend 50 billion on overseas economic aid in the 
next five years with the emphasis on building dams power stations 
and transmission facilities roads railways telecommunications 
factories and water management projects aid officials said 
american aid in recent years has shifted from such major capital 
projects to technical assistance they said 
foreign firms are already increasing their share of contracts in 
the japanese aid program but the us share is dropping strongly 
suggesting that the competitive environment has become more 
favorable but that potential america bidders are not widely aware 
of it an aid announcement said 
the idea that japanese aid is tied to the use of japanese firms 
and products is becoming obsolete and today less than half of 
the total is tied said jerome sherry chief of aids development 
assistance staff by contrast about twothirds of the current 
years us aid spending of about 85 billion is tied to us 
firms and goods he said in answer to a question 
japanese aid has so far have emphasized asia the proposed 
multibilliondollar multilateral aid initiative for the 
philippines led by the united states japan west european 
countries and the world bank is expected to be the largest program 
in any single country 
the united states and japan have consulted on projects for 
indonesia and india and potential new progams in africa weeks said 
he said koichiro matsura director general of the japanese 
foreign ministry economic cooperation bureau voiced interest in 
us collaboration when they met in manila last december

beatrice foods co has denied that it conspired to 
withhold engineering reports and other documents from the families 
of leukemia victims who lost a 1986 lawsuit charging the 
conglomerate with polluting their drinking water 
in papers filed late wednesday in federal court the company and 
its lawyers said they did not intentionally conceal anything 
and said the families had presented no evidence of a conspiracy 
neither beatrice nor its counsel intentionally concealed any 
documents or information from the plaintiffs or engaged in any 
conspiracy to conceal beatrice attorney jerome facher wrote 
the filing was the latest round in a longrunning legal battle 
between the families and the chicagobased food conglomerate the 
families attorney jan schlichtmann is appealing the jury verdict 
in the case and seeking a new trial 
in a brief filed last month schlichtmann charged that beatrice 
and its boston law firm hale amp dorr engaged in misconduct by 
concealing documents that could have influenced the case 
schlichtmann has asked us district judge walter jay skinner to 
find beatrice in default 
under orders from the 1st us circuit court of appeals skinner 
is conducting an unusual posttrial hearing into the fairness of 
the trial he presided over three years ago his first task is to 
determine whether beatrice willingly concealed evidence if so he 
will hold a hearing into whether the evidence was relevant 
skinner made no immediate ruling in response to beatrices 
filing and was not expected to rule until later this month

both sides are claiming degrees of victory in 
the court fight over californias insurance rateslashing 
proposition 103 but the verdict on wall street was unequivocal 
the insurance companies lost 
stock prices for several insurers heavily committed to the 
california market fell thursday after the state supreme court 
upheld most of the voterapproved ballot measure 
were all sitting here looking at our screens watching the 
stock drop said g alan zimmermann who follows the industry for 
smith barney upham amp co in new york 
investor skittishness was most evident among smaller insurers 
with significant amounts of their business in auto or property and 
casualty lines in california 
stock in 20th century industries dropped 187 to 2337 per 
share mercury general corp fell 150 to 15 a share safeco fell 
212 to 2650 a share and firemans fund fell 62 cents to 
3362 a share 
larger companies presumably are less prone to be hurt by 
regulatory decisions in any one state but stock prices declined 
for at least two big insurers which do at least 10 percent of their 
property and casualty business in california chubb corp was down 
162 to 6462 and cigna declined 37 cents to 5250 
the court unanimously upheld most provisions of the measure 
which requires insurers to submit rate hikes to state regulators 
for approval outlaws territorial rating creates an elected job of 
insurance commissioner and requires a gooddriver discount 
beginning in november the first anniversary of proposition 103s 
passage 
but the justices weakened the most controversial of prop 103s 
provisions an immediate rate cut to 20 percent below november 1987 
level 
prop 103 would have spared insurers the rate cut only if they 
could prove it threatened them with insolvency the court eased 
that standard ruling insurance companies are entitled to a fair 
rate of return 
the measure was triggered by dramatic increases in the price of 
car insurance but affects most property and casualty coverage as 
well 
wall street analysts called the ruling bad news for the 
business but noted the rollback section softened the blow somewhat 
however smith barneys zimmerman suggested a freshly elected 
insurance commissioner would be unlikely to be generous in granting 
exemptions 
confusion in the market likely will continue because of 
uncertainty in interpreting the courts fair return standard 
said a michael frinquelli an analyst at salomon brothers in new 
york 
i think the turmoil now simply shifts from the supreme court 
to the insurance commissioners office frinquelli said 
another analyst marvin shulman of moodys investors service 
suggested that any rate cuts would be delayed by appeals and 
administrative filings thus blunting any immediate effect of the 
ballot measure on insurers earnings

the house and senate approved on thursday 12 
trillion budgets which uphold a muchcriticized agreement with 
president bush to reduce the deficit without cutting spending or 
significantly raising taxes 
each chamber rejected several attempts to overhaul their 
blueprints for tax and spending policy in fiscal 1990 and then 
ratified the packages strongly in their final votes 
the house approved its plan 263157 after budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif called it the only choice for us 
to fulfill our budget responsibilities and avoid crisis 
the senate then passed its version 6831 after some minor 
tinkering and much grumbling that the deficit reduction in it was 
inadequate 
its clearly an attempt for this administration to be able to 
muddle its way through its first year said sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas who was the democrats vice presidential candidate last 
year 
both chambers on thursday overwhelmingly rejected more ambitious 
proposals to freeze government spending and cut further into 
the deficit the house also soundly defeated a proposal to cut red 
ink by taxing imported oil a day after the senate went on record 
against a gasoline tax boost 
as laid out by the white house agreement the budgets claim to 
shrink the federal deficit to just below 100 billion as required 
by the grammrudman law they would allow federal programs to grow 
but especially at the pentagon at less than the rate of inflation 
more than half of the nearly 28 billion in claimed savings 
would be from higher revenues sales of government assets higher 
fees for government services and 53 billion in unspecified tax 
increases 
critics said too much of the deficit reduction would be achieved 
through false accounting and gimmicks which do nothing to address 
the governments longterm fiscal imbalance 
defenders of the plan said more could be done later they 
described the budget as the first step in a continuing 
deficitreduction effort with the white house a cooperation 
marking a sharp change from the years of budget warfare during the 
reagan administration 
its minimal manageable done collaboratively said sen 
pete v domenici rnm senior republican on the senate budget 
committee who argued that the longterm fruits of the new spirit 
of bipartisan cooperation were immeasurable 
sen bennett johnston dla said the rosy economic assumptions 
used to calculate the lower deficit figures were somewhere 
between unlikely and preposterous 
this budget can at the most charitable be characterized as a 
slideby budget said rep charles schumer dny who said many 
lawmakers were frustrated by the constraints of the white house 
agreement 
while some may have been frustrated it appeared most were 
willing to go along in putting off any more ambitious 
deficitreduction efforts until later 
house democratic and republican leaders cooperated to assure 
passage thursday of their chambers version of the budget ruling 
out in advance any amendments which threatened to upset the 
delicate pact worked out in weeks of talks with the white house 
newt gingrich of georgia the new no 2 republican in the house 
urged everyone on our side to vote for the bipartisan package 
in past years gingrich and other house gop members rarely 
supported a budget in significant numbers 
the senate meantime appeared resignd to its own version of the 
plan 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine noted that the senate 
was accomplishing in two days what often has taken two weeks or 
more the senate even took time off from its budget debate thursday 
to consider a resolution on the elections in panama 
the house and senate must reconcile their competing versions of 
the budget before it becomes final that should be an easier task 
than usual this year because the broad outlines for federal 
spending were set in the bipartisan agreement 
military spending was set at 2992 billion about the same as 
this year and 42 billion less than needed to keep pace with 
inflation total pentagon obligations including those which spread 
past the end of fiscal 1990 were capped at 3055 billion 
about 17 billion would be set aside for foreign aid 
the house and senate versions both under the agreement call 
for costcutting in entitlement programs including medicare 
payments to doctors and hospitals and farm subsidies 
the agreement set an overall cap for domestic spending and the 
two chambers took somewhat different approaches the house 
allocated slightly more for education and health while the senate 
favored agriculture energy and law enforcement 
both chambers voted during their debates to increase spending 
for veterans health care well above the presidents request to 
address problems in that system 
the house plan contains more specifics but both envision 27 
billion in new fees for government services targets for the new 
fees include boat owners the nuclear power industry and 
broadcasters a current fee for veterans home loans due to expire 
would be extended 
the 57 billion in assets sales called for under the agreement 
remain mostly unspecified as is the next largest revenue source 
the 53 billion in taxes 
bush has said the tax money should be generated by cutting the 
tax rate on capital gains but democrats say cutting that rate is a 
big revenue loser in the long run and the wealthy would benefit 
the most 
in seeking to avoid the impact of the grammrudman law which 
calls for acrosstheboard spending cuts if the deficit projections 
later soar 10 billion above its 100 billion target the budgets 
and white house agreement relied on various accounting moves 
for example 
850 million in payments for farmers scheduled for fiscal 1990 
would be moved up to before the oct 1 start of the fiscal year 
477 million in savings is claimed by writing off food 
stamps which were issued but never used 
credit is claimed for 88 million not spent when congress 
rejected its pay raise earlier this year

avon products incs chairman reiterated at 
thursdays annual shareholders meeting that the cosmetics giant 
intends to remain independent and focus on its core beauty and 
direct selling businesses 
the assertion came a day after minneapolis investor irwin jacobs 
and rival amway corp disclosed they had amassed a 103 percent 
stake in avon and might seek to acquire the company 
but talk at the avon meeting was dominated by animal rights 
issues not takeovers as shareholders rejected a proposal to force 
the company to disclose details of animal testing used for its 
products 
chairman and chief executive james preston got prolonged 
applause when he opened the crowded meeting by saying i want to 
make it clear that avon is not for sale 
avon is completing the divestiture of its unprofitable 
healthcare services operations which include nursing homes 
retirement living facilities and substance abuse treatment centers 
making this the worst time to sell the rest of the company 
preston said 
in addition our distribution and selling systems to say 
nothing of our culture and values are enormously different from 
amway we see more conflicts than commonalities he said 
in march 1988 avons board approved a poison pill stock 
plan aimed at making an unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive 
the plan was designed to encourage prospective acquirors to 
negotiate with the board and deter takeover abuses 
according to avons proxy statement 
some 54 percent of the shares voted on thursday favored putting 
the plan to a shareholder vote but it did not constitute a 
majority of the shares outstanding needed to pass the resolution 
only one shareholder voiced support for a takeover saying that 
irwin jacobs and amway have done more for the share price in the 
last few days than management has done in the last year 
preston said avon stock which rose nearly 4 a share over the 
past two days still did not reflect the value of its basic 
businesses the stock closed down 87 cents thursday at 36 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
preston forecast that avon should grow at least as fast as the 
beauty industry which is about 2 or 3 percent in real terms he 
said the international direct selling business and retail sales of 
the companys giorgio red and uninhibited fragrances should lead 
sales growth 
preston conceded that avons financial condition is not 
strong he said in the next five years avon will attempt to halve 
its debt which should total less than 1 billion at the end of 
1989 and noted that costcutting measures will be offset somewhat 
by severance payments to employees 
many securities analysts attending the meeting were more 
concerned about how avons preferred shareholders would fare in the 
face of a takeover 
preferred shares are convertible to roughly 34 in cash or to 
one share of common stock preston stressed he would not speculate 
about what action the company would take against a takeover 
most of the twohour meeting was dominated by animal rights 
issues prestons disclosure that avon has not done any testing 
on animals since march 15 did little to calm more than a dozen 
animal supporters attending the meeting 
shareholders ultimately defeated a proposal that would have 
required avon to disclose the number of animals and their species 
used each year in both inhouse and contract laboratories and 
procedures that involve pain 
of the shares that voted on the proposal 101 percent supported 
it which the special interest group people for the ethical 
treatment of animals construed as somewhat of a victory last year 
a similar proposal garnered 6 percent of the vote 
several animal rights activitsts including one dressed as a 
rabbit carried placards outside the posh pierre hotel on fifth 
avenue site of the meeting
