a onetime chief aide to former hud secretary 
samuel pierce refused wednesday to answer questions from a house 
subcommittee investigating the agency saying he had been labeled a 
prime candidate for a criminal investigation 
lance h wilson asserted his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination just as pierce did a day earlier 
during the days proceedings a former hud staffer told of 
investigating a project on behalf of a contributor to president 
bushs 1980 campaign for the vice presidency 
my counsel has advised me that it is unwise for anyone labeled 
a prime candidate for a criminal investigation to testify under 
such circumstances wilson told the employment and housing 
subcommittee of the house committee on government operations 
echoing comments pierce made tuesday wilson said he was 
convinced the subcommittee had already prejudged me 
pressed by committee members on how he had been prejudged 
wilson cited a comment by rep christopher shays rconn at a 
july hearing at which wilson failed to appear 
shays said then he was convinced people would be prosecuted for 
influencepeddling and fraud at hud and that wilson was a prime 
candidate for criminal investigation 
wilson is the fourth former department of housing and urban 
development official to cite the fifth amendment 
deborah gore dean who in 1984 succeeded wilson as pierces 
chief aide and r hunter cushing former director of huds 
multifamily housing programs asserted the same rights in hearings 
during the summer 
however only pierce and wilson alleged they had been prejudged 
former regional hud officials in testimony wednesday described 
wilson as the man to see for getting approval of hud grant loan or 
guarantee applications both during and after his tenure at the 
agency 
dick eudaley who headed huds fivestate regional office in 
fort worth texas from 1982 to may 1984 said wilson had told him 
that a 7 million apartment project in fort worth was going to be 
approved despite unanimous opposition from the agencys technical 
staff 
the feeling within the agency was that this project had the 
personal interest of the secretarys office and mr wilson 
eudaley said 
the 800unit regalridge apartment project developed by fort 
worth real estate developer leonard briscoe is now in shambles 
financially eudaley said 
two years later briscoe gave wilson a 15 percent interest in 
the 24 million wedgewood plaza apartment project briscoe was 
developing in riviera beach fla lantos said 
alexander naclerio former director of housing in huds new york 
area office said he was called at home by wilson on a weekend 
evening in 1982 and asked to look into a project in puerto rico 
wilson indicated this was on behalf of a major contributor to 
george bushs vice presidential campaign delio rojo naclerio 
testified 
naclerio said he reported his findings to wilson that revenue 
from nearby commercial property owned by rojo be used to reduce the 
required subsidies 
the washington post said in thursday editions that hud officials 
it did not identify had reported an aide to bush asked wilson to 
meet with rojo about the project 
the newspaper said aides to vice president bush said they made 
referrals to government agencies without endorsements 
rojos consultant carlos figueroa said he arranged the 
rojowilson meeting on his own and probably discussed the matter 
with rafael v capo an aide to the vice president 
naclerio who became a consultant after retiring in 1986 said 
he sent wilson a 5000 check that year after getting a 15000 
check from a puerto rican developer who had sought help on a hud 
rehabilitation project 
naclerio said he also sent a 10000 check to wilson in seeking 
hud mortgage assistance for a 123 million 467unit apartment 
project in manhattan after being told that the departments 
approval was being held up because i had a problem with hunter 
cushing 
naclerio a 39year career employee at hud before his 
retirement said wilson called back and said cushing assured him 
there would be no interference 
wilson a vice president of paine webber group inc an 
investment banking house took the fifth amendment four times to 
questions posed by subcommittees chairman rep tom lantos 
dcalif 
after several bitter exchanges between his lawyer and lantos he 
did answer two questions posed by shays 
shays asked if huds inspector general who earlier this year 
released a report finding widespread problems in the departments 
moderate rehabilitation housing subsidy program had tried to 
interview him and if he had in fact been interviewed 
wilson responded yes to having been asked to meet with the 
inspector general and no to whether they met asked to explain 
why he didnt meet with the inspector general wilson again cited 
the fifth amendment 
you have a lot of similarity with your boss samuel pierce 
because he basically did the same thing shays said he used 
every excuse not to meet with the ig inspector general like you 
did 
wilsons lawyer raymond banoun tried to object but was 
lectured by lantos you will not interrupt a member of this 
committee 
outside the hearing room banoun assailed the committee members 
for ridiculing someone because he asserted his constitutional 
rights 
wilson requested and was granted a leave from paine webber after 
his name surfaced in lantos investigation 
paine webber chairman donald b marron told the subcommittee 
wednesday that wilson had not sought approval to engage in outside 
business activities such as consulting as required by the 
companys code of conduct 
wilson signed a statement at the end of 1988 certifying that he 
had abided by the company code marron said 
james treadway a paine webber vice president who conducted an 
internal inquiry into wilsons activities after charges surfaced 
that he used political connections to attract hudrelated business 
for the company said the probe turned up nothing improper 
lantos cited paine webber documents indicating that wilson had 
spent more than 10000 entertaining hud officials 
to the extent they the expenses are personal we will seek 
reimbursement he said

twice a month when the moon is full muoi 
cao am and his wife take white flowers and incense to pray at the 
graves of their sons soldiers who died because of vietnams 
intervention in cambodia 
we burn this incense to remember you may god give you good 
fortune said muoi 70 bowing before the peeling white 
tombstones invaded by grass his wife 66 stood aside and wept 
quietly 
thinh 18 was killed in cambodia in october 1978 when khmer 
rouge soldiers ambushed vietnamese forces operating in the country 
two months before hanois invasion 
the next year sau 21 died along vietnams northern border 
with china which beijing attacked to punish vietnam for 
invading cambodia that was two months before his first child was 
born 
the tombstones yellowing photographs and the equivalent of 2 
a month compensation from the government are virtually the only 
reminders of the youths their parents called kind and friendly 
the tragedy of the muois of dan phuong tri village near hanoi 
is the tragedy of the 11year cambodian war that some foreigners 
have called vietnams vietnam a comparison to americas 
intervention in vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s 
vietnam says it has withdrawn its soldiers and will let the 
hanoiinstalled government fight the guerrillas vietnam couldnt 
eradicate despite superior firepower 
vietnam is a communist nation so the war has not provoked the 
public anguish that tore america but it is clear it was a costly 
venture for vietnam 
the former deputy commander of vietnamese forces in cambodia 
said last year that 30000 vietnamese died in border clashes with 
pol pots fanatical khmer rouge regime in 1977 to 1978 and 25000 
vietnamese soldiers have died since vietnam invaded in december 
1978 and drove the khmer rouge to the jungles 
many of the remains of vietnamese soldiers are along the 
frontier at western tay ninh province waiting to be returned to 
families said gen tran cong man editor of the official army 
newspaper quan doi nhan dan 
we will build a memorial for them at the border he said 
tens of thousands of young vietnamese served in what must be 
among the worlds most difficult battlefields tran dinh dac 31 
recalled long periods in the forests hungry often stricken by 
malaria always fearful of guerrilla mines and ambushes 
and the skins of the pol potists are thicker than that of the 
vietnamese he said at his roadside drinks stand they are not 
affected by thorns 
the cambodian war broke out after millions of vietnamese already 
had been killed or wounded in four decades of virtually continuous 
fighting 
the north vietnam communists had fought the french colonial 
rulers the japanese occupiers of world war ii then south vietnam 
and its american allies thousands more died in chinas punitive 
strike across the border 
many millions who escaped the fire of battle also suffered 
noncommunist nations punished vietnam for invading cambodia by 
diplomatic and economic blockades that have added to the poor 
living conditions for vietnams 65 million people more than 
600000 people have fled the country by boat in the last decade 
ten years ago the development of vietnam and south korea was 
at the same level but now korea has left us far behind said a 
vietnamese government economist who requested anonymity 
we hope to have peace to concentrate all our efforts to 
rebuild our country our economy we want to begin a new period 
minister of justice phan hien said in an interview 
the young people today talk not of sacrifice for the revolution 
but of school and careers marriage and children or simply 
enjoying life 
we have a hard time having fun we are always working said 
a young foreign ministry worker whose major goals are being able to 
go dancing to american pop music and to buy a japanesemade 
motorbike 
a couple of months ago students at the university of hanoi 
protested the conditions on campus including the lack of equipment 
and the meager salaries of teachers a western ambassador said the 
government promised improvements 
the burden of the war in cambodia probably wont end with the 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers need jobs in a society 
already troubled by high unemployment 
vietnam may also remain isolated because its pullout was not 
internationally monitored and thus will be greeted with skepticism 
also the noncommunist world demands not just a pullout but a 
political settlement in cambodia

three cuban human rights activists will be 
tried next month on charges of spreading false information after a 
drug trafficking trial that led to several executions cubans 
official news agency said 
prensa latina said tuesday that elizardo sanchez hiram abi 
cobas and hubert jerez were arrested in august and charged with 
giving false information to us television networks and radio 
marti a us government station beamed to cuba in an attempt to 
discredit cuban courts 
the prosecution has asked for prison terms of three or four 
years for the three activists 
prensa latina said lawyers for the defendants would have 10 days 
to study the charges and prepare their cases and that the trial 
would begin within 20 days after that 
the defendants were accused of telling us media that maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa sanchez had been psychologically tortured and had 
confessed to drug trafficking while under the influence of drugs 
administered by his interrogators 
ochoa a cuban war hero and three other men were executed in 
july following trials that revealed a criminal ring in the cuban 
defense and interior departments that helped smuggle drugs from 
colombia to the united states 
the trial and the corruption it revealed were extremely 
embarrassing to cubas communist leader fidel castro who had 
insisted for years that accusations of drug trafficking were part 
of a us plot to discredit his government 
the three rights activists were members of a group called 
defenders of human rights which prensa latina said was 
counterrevolutionary and illegal

as a child ingmar bergmans parents 
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed to amuse himself he 
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and 
pretended he was at the movies 
now 71 the famed director has written a screenplay about his 
father erik bergman an insecure and depressionprone pastor and 
his mother karin a woman of iron selfdiscipline who cringed at 
any show of love 
in good intentions bergman casts back his memory and his 
imagination to the first 10 years of his parents turbulent 
relationship and marriage 
the play is a sixhour chronicle in four acts to be shown as a 
fourpart television series and a twopart movie production begins 
late next year and the scheduled premiere will be on swedish 
television channel one in 1992 
i feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who 
are in my blood my nerves and my genes bergman said 
bergman gave up film direction after his 1982 fanny and 
alexander which won four academy awards since then he has been 
busy producing stage plays at the royal dramatic theater in 
stockholm which once rejected him for a job when he was an 
aspiring 21yearold production assistant 
for good intentions bergman vacated the directors chair to 
danish filmmaker bille august whose pelle the conqueror won 
the 1989 academy award for best foreign film bergman said that 
after he saw pelle six times the choice of the 40yearold 
dane was obvious 
august called the screenplay one of the best love stories i 
have ever read it is a great drama and an honor to take part in 
delivering 
as evidenced in his confessionlike autobiography the magic 
lantern bergman has been grappling with confusion for many years 
over his feelings for his parents 
they have appeared on screen before in some of the best of 
bergmans 50 films in fanny and alexander a softspoken 
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and 
hatred 
the 1973 film cries and whispers is about three sisters and 
a servant girl bergman has said they represent four aspects of his 
mother whom he was seeking to understand through his characters 
he nurtured the idea for good intentions ever since 
completing fanny and alexander in his memoirs he wrote about 
his parents from his childhood perspective which was often brutal 
and angry 
it left him unsatisfied i started writing about all the 
dreams and memories of my parents finally i had a script he 
said it took him five months last year to write it 
the new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple a 
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an 
affluent home the characters have fictional names which allows 
bergman to play with facts 
the movie covers the time of the couples meeting in 1909 to the 
year of bergmans birth in 1918 
in his memoirs bergman wrote about his failure to reach his 
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display 
of feeling his emotions he said inhabited a closed room and 
were produced on command but never rashly 
he was raised according to the concepts of sin confession 
punishment forgiveness and grace concrete factors in 
relationships between children parents and god 
he described his father a lutheran minister as nervous 
irritable and depressive he was always fretting and given to 
violent outbursts of temper 
his mother was always tense slept badly and used strong 
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety 
like father she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy 
the book barely touches on his parents feelings for each other 
but a stormy picture emerges when it does 
as a child he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and 
scuffle we didnt know that mother had gone through a passionate 
love affair or that father suffered from severe depression mother 
was preparing to break out of her marriage father threatening to 
take his own life 
divorce in those days was almost unthinkable especially for a 
respected pastor and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple 
yet the reconciliation was mostly for show what was outwardly 
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery 
and exhausting conflicts he wrote

priceless diaries and other confederate 
relics have been destroyed or damaged by hurricane hugo the 
director of the confederate museum says 
whats left of the collection was to be moved today said the 
director june wells 
the roof of the 148yearold market hall building was blown 
away exposing the collections flags papers and uniforms to wind 
and rain 
the damage is quite extensive said mrs wells one of the 
160 or so members of the charleston chapter of the united daughters 
of the confederacy which owns the collection 
the reason were having to leave so quickly is the ceiling is 
falling 
many paper items have been damaged she said including portions 
of a daily log kept at fort sumter by the fortress engineer during 
fighting in 1861 and 1863 after confederate forces occupied the 
site 
those papers she said are now soaking wet and of course it 
was watersoluble ink some of them hopefully we can dry out 
mrs wells said the collection was started when confederate war 
veterans convening in charleston in 1898 donated memorabilia 
the cityowned building is itself significant 
when the war between the states started our market hall was 
where the young men came into charleston to get their armaments and 
supplies and destinations she said 
the collection includes the first rifle cannon made in america 
the original secession flag flown at charlestons customs house 
after south carolina seceded from the union on dec 20 1860 and 
the first and last confederate flags to fly over fort sumter where 
the first shots of the war were fired on april 12 1861 
the museum is selective 
nothing from sherman she said of william tecumseh sherman 
the union general who led the march to the sea from atlanta to the 
atlantic 
no yankee things the only thing we have are a few captured 
yankee things 
mrs wells is uncertain where or for how long the collection 
will be stored 
this will be first time theyve ever left that building since 
they were put there in 1898 she said the building is unsafe 
and the collection is unsafe its kind of unbelievable

portauprince haiti ap the united states should restore 
60 million in suspended aid now that haiti has scheduled elections 
for next year military president lt gen prosper avril says 
avril in power since being installed in a coup a year ago said 
that without international assistance his government has been 
unable to provide the people of this impoverished caribbean nation 
with jobs and and security 
nevertheless we have demonstrated our will to govern this 
country democratically avril said in an interview monday at the 
national palace but if the us does not assist us financially 
we still may have problems 
washington suspended twothirds of its direct aid to haiti after 
a nov 29 1987 electionday massacre and the subsequent suspension 
of balloting by the military the us government has said that 
transfering power to a civilian government is a key condition for 
restoring the aid 
avrils government said sunday that local legislative and 
presidential elections will be held next year in the interview 
avril said the army would not interfere with the balloting and 
would ensure security 
the government has not said however whether or not it will 
allow international observers monitor haitis next election 
presidential elections are to be held in two rounds oct 17 
and nov 11 1990 the first round will be among about 10 
candidates and the second will be a runoff among an unspecified 
number of the top votegetters 
we have announced the electoral timetable we now expect to 
receive the assistance which will make the elections a success 
avril said 
when asked whether he would be a candidate avril said the 
only thing i do with my power is try to put my country on the road 
to democracy the only way to develop this country 
under haitis constitution no member of the military can become 
president less than a year after resigning therefore avril would 
have to resign before oct 17 in order to run 
next years balloting will be haitis first presidential 
election since jan 17 1988 when civilian leslie manigat was 
elected in balloting widely regarded as fraudulent he was ousted 
in an army coup five months later 
a previous military government stopped balloting during the 1987 
election when street gangs assisted by soldiers shot and hacked to 
death 34 people at the polls 
the canceled vote was the first attempt at free elections after 
decades of duvalier family dictatorships presidentforlife 
jeanclaude duvalier who succeeded his father francois papa 
doc duvalier on his fathers death fled during antigovernment 
demonstrations in february 1986 and now lives in france 
avril 51 took power on sept 17 1988 after a coup against 
the regime of lt gen henri namphy that was organized by 
noncommissioned officers the coup leaders said they wanted 
democratic reforms and an end to what they called statesponsored 
violence 
shortly after taking office avril began a 19point program to 
give haiti a constitutional government purge undesirable elements 
from the army and improve soldiers living conditions 
on dec 14 his government signed five international human 
rights conventions but rights groups have said violations often 
perpetrated by soldiers are still common in haiti where 80 
percent of the 5 million residents live in poverty 
in march avril partially restored the 1987 constitution that 
namphy had suspended and in april installed a ninemember 
independent electoral council to organize next years elections

teresa stratas returned to the metropolitan 
opera on the second night of its season for the first time since 
the 198182 season and triumphed 
she sang gloriously in all three of the puccini oneact operas 
called il trittico 
before the evening began on tuesday an announcement was made 
from the stage that miss stratas had food poisoning on sunday and 
was feeling weak but would sing 
an unusually long first intermission made the audience uneasy 
about the canadian sopranos health but in the second opera 
suor angelica she touched the audiences heart and made the 
biggest triumph of all that opera received a standing ovation and 
small pieces of paper were thrown from balconies 
miss stratas always has been an actress acting by moving on 
stage and by coloring her voice creating people of depth of the 
characters she sings 
when she sings as sister angelica in a convent one could 
imagine her previous life of enthusiasms sorrows and loveliness 
she is visited by her aunt a princess who says the child she bore 
out of wedlock has been dead two years miss stratas flings herself 
down with a howl of naked pain 
only twice during the evening was she shrill with high notes 
both for effect 
the other time was during the first opera il tabarro the 
cloak miss stratas always has been superb as gritty characters 
the kind some prima donnas are too stiff or grand to convey in 
il tabarro she is the bored restless wife of an aging barge 
captain attracted to a handsome younger man 
the despairing barge captain finds out strangles the young man 
and hides the body under his long cloak usually the opera ends by 
his opening the cloak and showing his wife the corpse on tuesday 
it was made a little more gruesome the husband enfolding his wife 
under his cloak too then pushing her down atop the corpse 
in the final opera the splendidly staged comic opera gianni 
schicchi miss stratas sang a smaller role the young daughter of 
gianni schicchi but in it she gets to sing the most famous aria 
of the evening o mio bambino caro which she did with sublime 
tenderness 
other important singers of the evening were juan pons and 
giorgio merighi as the husband and lover in il tabarro 
florence quivar as the cold princess in suor angelica and bruno 
pola as gianni schicchi along with mignon dunn vinson cole and 
federico davia among a dead mans avaricious relatives

as vietnamese soldiers nearby packed 
their bags to return home a dozen cambodian troops were loading 
crates of sovietmade mortar rounds onto a truck bound for the 
distant mountains 
just down the dirt road barechested kan kun one of the 
countrys tens of thousands of village militiamen showed off his 
ak47 automatic rifle and two magazines 
all the men who can use a gun to fight pol pot he said 
referring to the shadowy figure believed to still lead the khmer 
rouge guerrillas 
it was an ominous portent of cambodias future these scenes 
that reporters stumbled upon along the tonle sap lake in 
northwestern siem reap province 
what hanoi said were its last soldiers in cambodia returned home 
tuesday 10 years and nine months after vietnam invaded ousted the 
fanatical khmer rouge and sparked a civil war 
like the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan vietnams purported 
pullout likely will improve the international standing of the 
former occupier but condemn the country it occupied to a new phase 
of fighting 
since peace talks again have failed the vietnameseinstalled 
phnom penh government will now face guerrillas alone as the 
sovietinstalled government in kabul has done since the red army 
went home in february 
but kabul still stands despite widespread predictions of a 
quick collapse and phnom penhs position is even stronger said 
many diplomats including a soviet embassy official and ngo dien 
vietnams ambassador to phnom penh 
unlike kabul phnom penh controls most of the countrys 
territory they said the afghan resistance can recruit from 6 
million refugees in pakistan while the cambodian guerrillas have 
just 300000 in thailand 
the afghan guerrillas have much wider international backing and 
support from the people within afghanistan 
the khmer rouge the largest cambodia guerrilla group is widely 
hated and cannot survive without chinese and thai support and 
that is wavering 
in the not too far away future i dont think thailand will go 
on supporting the khmer rouge and china also ngo dien said 
the communist khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people 
in during its nearly fouryear rule as it tried to turn the country 
into a primitive agrarian commune 
just as in afghanistan superpowers continue supplying the means 
to kill chinese shipments continue so do soviet arms to phnom 
penh soviet ambassador rashit khamidouline said although they 
were not increased with vietnams pullout because we dont want 
to escalate the war 
the khmer rouge siege of pailin near its sanctuaries in 
thailand has been compared with the afghan guerrillas siege of 
jalalabad near the pakistan frontier the cambodian guerrilla 
attempt to create a liberated zone has intensified with 
vietnams retreat and is seen as a crucial test of whether pure 
firepower can resolve the war 
most analysts say neither army can win in cambodia 
the key then will be whether there can be talks between phnom 
penhs premier hun sen and guerrilla leader prince norodom 
sihanouk who heads the coalition joining his forces with the khmer 
rouge and the khmer peoples national liberation front 
in the coming dry season the guerrillas will launch 
attacks to test the strength of the phnom penh government after 
that both sides may become more flexible said khieu kanharith 
a prominent newspaper editor in the cambodian capital 
if genuine the vietnamese pullout would weaken phnom penh 
militarily but perhaps more crucially it would erode the 
guerrillas international position 
the guerrillas call the troop movement a fake but many 
diplomats believe vietnam has withdrawn at least the bulk of its 
army that weakens the key guerrilla charge that phnom penh is 
merely a vietnamese puppet 
the guerrillas may also lose morale if they see they are now 
only killing fellow cambodians 
anticipating this the guerrillas recently stepped up charges 
that vietnam is controlling the country with 125 million 
vietnamese settlers 
phnom penh wants a political settlement because otherwise most 
noncommunist countries will not end diplomatic and economic 
embargoes that have hurt impoverished cambodia 
but it sees a good second option in hints that even without a 
settlement a few countries like australia and thailand may 
recognize phnom penh after a general election expected early next 
year 
there are no signs of progress on breaking the central impasse 
in talks the future of the khmer rouge 
hun sen repeated sunday that he will make no concessions on his 
demand that the khmer rouge army and political organization be 
dismantled sihanouk says the khmer rouge will continue fighting 
unless it is allowed into a transitional coalition government 
however the claimed vietnamese pullout will focus greater 
attention on resolving this question and more than ever the khmer 
rouge is being pressured by its two strongest backers china and 
thailand 
for the first time since vietnams invasion three chinese 
officials visited cambodia for economic talks earlier this year an 
indication beijing is keeping its options open 
and at pailin and elsewhere the thai army has halted artillery 
support for the khmer rouge and cleared out some of its military 
bases and secretive civilian camps officials said 
hanoi hopes its pullout will end the western economic blockades 
that have made vietnam worse off than the country it occupied 
its retreat from cambodia coincides with declining soviet 
influence in both countries and could begin a strategic realignment 
favoring the noncommunist world diplomats say

a new study by the agriculture department 
suggests that a phaseout of worldwide farm subsidies and trade 
barriers could put american corn farmers in an even stronger 
position to dominate international trade in coarse grains 
nearly threefourths of the worlds coarse grains corn 
barley sorghum oats and rye are grown in the united states 
soviet union european economic community china and eastern europe 
the united states alone produces about 30 percent of the total 
mostly as corn which as a livestock feed grain is the main 
ingredient for producing meat poultry and dairy products for 
american consumers 
one of the us goals in the current uruguay round of 
negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade is to 
eventually eliminate agricultural trade barriers including 
subsidies that would impair free trade 
the report one of a series by the departments economic 
research service is in the october issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine 
while there are adjustment costs involved in moving away from 
protectionism both theory and research results suggest that the 
benefits of free trade outweigh the costs the report said but 
because there never has been free trade in agriculture the 
findings in these articles are of necessity speculative 
if the move toward free trade is successful it would push up 
the volume of world coarse grain trade and increase grain prices 
the report said 
us exports likely would increase in response to rising 
demand the report said in turn market receipts for us 
producers would go up as world prices rose 
however it added total returns to farmers would decline 
including losses in government payments unless some kind of 
decoupled income support was provided 
coarse grain production in the united states would probably 
increase as much of the land idled under annual federal acreage 
programs returned to production the report said and us 
livestock producers would likely boost output to help fill a rising 
world demand for meat 
world meat consumption would go up as the eec and japan 
removed trade barriers which would lower their domestic consumer 
meat prices the report said more us livestock production 
would boost the demand for us coarse grains 
as a result of a move away from protectionism world coarse 
grain production would shift away from inefficient producers to 
more efficient ones the report said that would occur within 
individual countries as well as around the world 
the us argentina and thailand all efficient producers 
probably would increase output the report said however 
production likely would decline in the eec japan and taiwan 
over the long haul coarse grain production probably would 
increase because of the rise in world livestock prices the report 
assumed that the rise in meat demand and prices would be triggered 
by a growing population and rising incomes particularly in the 
third world 
because of lower domestic coarse grain prices eec farmers 
probably would reduce production the report said but the size 
of the adjustment would depend on how relative prices changed and 
how much land went out of production 
livestock producers in the eec would increase their feed 
demands which could force the 12nation trading bloc into becoming 
a net importer of coarse grains once again 
china the soviet union and eastern europe the other major 
producers of coarse grains probably will not participate in this 
round of gatt trade reform the report said 
as it is now the united states eec argentina canada china 
australia thailand and south africa account for more than 90 
percent of the worlds coarse grain exports the us share was 55 
percent in the 198587 period 
some of the major exporters also are importers and there have 
been shifts for example the report said since 1985 the eec and 
china have changed from being net importers to net exporters 
the biggest coarse grain importers include japan eec soviet 
union saudi arabia south korea taiwan eastern europe and 
mexico these account for nearly threefourths of the world total 
coarse grain imports

thousands of miles of track cast off by the 
big railroad companies are a growing part of the rural 
transportation network as local or regional systems says an 
agriculture department report 
martin buzz fitzpatrick administrator of the departments 
office of transportation said tuesday the number and mileage of 
small railroads began to increase in the 1970s but gained a full 
head of steam in the mid1980s 
however future growth in the local and regional railroad 
movement probably will be determined by the outcome of court 
rulings as to the rights of rail labor in branch line sales and in 
transactions that create new railroads he said 
since the staggers act of 1980 which eased the way for the big 
companies to sell off unprofitable branch lines nearly 200 new 
small railroads have been formed the report said a fifth of these 
are owned by shippers 
local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15 
percent of the nations rail system or 30000 miles and employ 
30000 people the report said last year these carriers 
generated 15 billion in revenues 
small railroads include local freight lines that earn less than 
20 million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track 
regional freight lines earn between 20 million and 87 million 
annually and operate at least 350 miles of track 
the report said that as much as 25000 additional miles of rail 
line is expected to be cast off by the bigger class i railroads 
before they are finished with restructuring plans eighteen 
thousand miles are to be sold to small railroads over the next two 
years

the setting for president bushs 
education summit this week is the university of virginia the 
academical village that thomas jefferson founded in the serene 
foothills of the blue ridge mountains as an experiment in learning 
jefferson wanted to avoid the usual large and common den of 
noise at other universities but whether bush and the nations 
governors respect jeffersons wishes will be evident when they 
convene today 
the purpose of the twoday summit a major bush initiative is 
to look for ways to improve american public education jefferson 
also was searching for something different and better in higher 
education 
the third us president and squire of nearby monticello where 
bush and the governors will dine during the summit jefferson 
sought a new kind of learning environment at his university 
rather than building a single huge structure jefferson 
envisioned a campus of small classroom dwellings where professors 
and students would live closely together as a community of scholars 
such a concept he wrote would amount to an academical 
village instead of a large and common den of noise of filth and 
of fetid air 
jefferson also redirected the focus of higher education toward 
public service and practical matters and away from the university 
as a training academy for clergymen and academics 
the university received its charter from the state in 1819 and 
opened with 68 students and a faculty of eight in 1825 it has 
grown to an enrollment of 17000 undergraduates and 6000 graduate 
students today but still preserves much of its jeffersonian 
heritage 
students still live on the lawn designed by jefferson four 
colonnaded rows of rooms reserved for selected applicants claiming 
an address on the lawn is regarded as a high honor even though 
residents must walk outside on winter mornings to reach the 
bathroom 
at the end of the lawn is the rotunda a former library and 
classroom building which jefferson modeled after the roman 
pantheon it is now reserved for important meetings such as the 
bush summit 
if bush or the governors refer to the campus here they will 
be wrong according to jeffersonian tradition it is called the 
grounds and students are firstyear secondyear and so on 
instead of freshmen sophomores juniors and seniors 
bush is following jeffersons example in wanting to be known as 
the education president says jennings l wagoner a university 
professor who is an expert on jeffersons educational views 
jefferson saw education as a national priority that required 
federal leadership wagoner said and believed that carrying out 
those priorities was the responsibility of state and local 
governments 
most of the universitys students are likely to regard the 
summit as a sideshow causing only minor inconvenience such as 
cancellation of boxing and weightlifting classes because of the 
gymnasiums conversion into a press center 
nonetheless some students are keenly interested in the summit 
i think its exciting that the 51 most important 
administrators in the country are meeting here said jim greiner 
a junior who is studying government 
greiner said summits tend to be exercises in press relations 
where no real work is accomplished what really matters here he 
said is how much money bush is willing to pump into the schools 
if bush wants to be known as the education president he will 
have to restructure his spending priorities greiner said when 
people say what has he done for education he can point to the 
conference as a positive step but the bottom line is money

intercity bus service operators say attempts 
to open all buses to disabled americans will instead mean the end 
of public transportation for many rural areas and the poor 
bus operators from greyhound down to small regional carriers 
told a house subcommittee tuesday that the proposed americans with 
disabilities act unfairly singles them out with its requirement 
that all buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts 
no other segment of the transportation industry would be told 
how to make vehicles accessible and none are being told to make 
every vehicle accessible bus operators said 
the mandatory lift requirement with its attendant costs 
including installation would spell the end of intercity service 
in the united states frank m henry of the american bus 
association told the house public works and transportation surface 
transportation subcommittee 
rural communities now served only by intercity bus would have 
no public transportation available he said customers now 
served many of whom are young old and poor and who have no other 
means of transportation would be stranded 
advocates for the disabled say many handicapped people are poor 
and live in the country so it is essential they have access to 
intercity buses 
without access to transportation all the other things the act 
provides dont matter said tim cook director of the 
washingtonbased national disability center 
the act guarantees a broad range of rights to the nations 
estimated 43 million disabled estimates by various groups at the 
hearing were that anywhere from 760000 to 17 million of those 
disabled use wheelchairs 
fred g currey head of dallasbased greyhound bus lines inc 
said 50 percent of the companys passengers earn less than 15000 
a year even a slight increase in ticket costs due to the act would 
price many passengers out of a ticket he said 
the company would have to cut service to up to half its 10000 
communities and companies that operate feeder lines would have to 
do the same 
the bus operators propose that service be available on demand 
advocates of the disabled say this violates the intent of the bill 
since the disabled have the same right to spontaneous travel that 
others have 
the disabled advocates also say the intercity bus services are 
treated more leniently because of compromises in the version of the 
bill passed earlier this month by the senate 
the senate bill gives the bus industry six to seven years to 
comply longer than anyone else they say they also say that 
wheelchair lifts are not the only way to provide access although 
the lifts have been the main item of discussion in testimony on the 
legislation

president bush may be fulfilling one campaign 
promise with his education summit that begins today but his 
overall report card at this point would bear a lot of incompletes 
any compilation of the presidents record eight months into 
his first year would show movement on dozens of campaign pledges 
but final action on only a few particularly in the domestic arena 
in fact many of bushs firstterm initiatives are caught in a 
colossal congressional logjam just days before the start of fiscal 
year 1990 
the president did score some impressive victories in recent days 
on the foreign policy front including his wellreceived un 
initiative to limit chemical weapons and an array of soviet 
concessions on arms control issues 
and a senate deadlock over funding bushs war on drugs appeared 
to be broken with white house acceptance of a compromise plan 
still the bulk of bushs domestic proposals to congress 
nearly all of them reflecting campaign promises appeared to be 
languishing 
and then there are the bush summits 
the twoday conference of the nations governors today and 
thursday in charlottesville va is just one of five separate 
summits bush the candidate said he would call in his first year 
only one other has actually been held last mays summit of 
north atlantic treaty organization members but that coincided with 
natos 40th anniversary celebration and was not specifically 
arranged by the united states 
another summit is said to be in the planning stage although no 
date or location has yet been set a latin american summit on drug 
trafficking 
bush also proposed an international summit on global warming to 
be held in washington and to include the soviet union china and 
developing nations as well as western industrial nations 
but little has been heard on that subject since he took office 
also proposed but not heard from again devoting a sevennation 
economic summit to agriculture 
the president has a better track record on submitting items on 
his 1988 campaign agenda to congress but the bulk of them are now 
bogged down in the democraticcontrolled house and senate 
for instance on education subject of todays summit bush last 
spring proposed a 414 million package that included a 250 million 
proposal for national merit scholarship and 100 million for magnet 
schools 
but the only part of bushs package to make any headway in 
either chamber to date is a relatively modest math and science 
scholarship program which has passed the house 
bushs proposal to overhaul the clean air act following up on 
campaign pledges to be the environmental president as well as the 
education president is creeping along house speaker thomas foley 
dwash recently said house action on it this year is unlikely 
bushs proposal for child care and adoption tax credits are also 
in congressional limbo and his proposal to reduce the capital 
gains tax is now the subject of fierce partisan wrangling 
the president vowed anew on tuesday to fight for the lower rate 
even if it means prolonging an impasse that threatens to trigger 
automatic spending cuts next month 
chances seem good that fiscal 1990 will begin without agreement 
on deficitreduction legislation to which the capital gains issue 
is tied 
a variety of other bush proposals including much of his 
anticrime package also are making little headway 
one problem suggested political analyst norman ornstein at the 
conservative american enterprise institute is that bush may have 
waited too long allowing the mythical first 100 days to elapse 
before submitting many of his proposals 
we did not have the usual pattern of a new president coming in 
and having a package of items being ready to go ornstein said 
after all for months we were saying is he ever going to 
propose anything 
now it means more than our usual share of chaos as a new 
fiscal year is about to begin without a budget without a great 
sense of direction he added 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee also contended bush dumped too many initiatives on 
congress at once without suggesting how he would pay for them all 
its kind of the free lunch approach to dealing with national 
issues panetta said 
then there are some bush campaign pledges that havent yet 
surfaced 
for instance his proposal for individual savings account a 
plan under which americans could stash away up to 2000 a year and 
not pay taxes on the interest until the account matured after five 
years or so 
when bush unveiled the plan it was immediately ridiculed by 
democrats who challenged gop campaign aides to explain how it 
differed significantly from us savings bonds 
they couldnt and that was the last heard about it

the number of physicians hit with serious 
disciplinary actions is increasing but it is still too easy for 
doctors to get away with negligent practices a public interest 
health group said today 
there were 1495 physicians who had their medical licenses 
revoked or suspended or who were put on probation by their state 
medical licensing board in 1987 a 17 percent increase over the 
previous year said a public citizen health research group report 
public citizen said thats nearly three serious disciplinary 
actions for every 1000 us doctors but that its not enough 
a physician could still operate drunk commit a gross act of 
negligence or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slap on 
the wrist from his or her states medical board in most states 
the groups report said 
public citizen estimates more than 100000 americans are injured 
or killed each year because of physicians negligence 
the absence in most states of the maximum effort to discipline 
these doctors is one of the most serious threats to the health of 
american patients the report said 
public citizen a public interest group associated with ralph 
nader began tabulating the actions of the state medical boards in 
1984 when it found 745 serious disciplinary actions revocation 
suspension or probation in 1985 boards took 1089 actions a 46 
percent increase from the previous year that rose by 17 percent to 
1277 in 1986 
the report attributes the increase to a spate of adverse 
publicity and state and federal legislation during 1987 and 
1988 44 state legislatures strengthened state oversight of 
physicians the group said 
the group praised the efforts of west virginia which had the 
highest rate of serious disciplinary actions against doctors in 
1987 the states medical board ordered serious disciplinary 
actions at the rate of eight physicians per 1000 public citizen 
said 
kansas had the lowest rate about one per 2000 according to 
the groups analysis 
until the rate of doctor discipline in this country 
significantly increases there is no realistic possibility of a 
major decrease in the amount of medical malpractice said public 
citizen 
the group recommends raising doctors licensing fees to 500 per 
year to finance doctor disciplinary actions and reduce the backlogs 
that plague many state medical boards 
public citizen also recommends periodic recertification of 
physicians giving state boards broader authority to evaluate 
doctors and take action against them and requiring insurance 
companies to rate doctors so those with the best records pay the 
lowest premiums

house members who want stricter auto emissions 
standards say they wont let an initial defeat prevent another bid 
to toughen president bushs clean air bill 
administration opponents on the energy and commerce environment 
subcommittee failed tuesday to amend the bill as they sought to 
make auto requirements far tougher than those in smogchoked 
california 
panel chairman henry a waxmans plan lost on a voice vote but 
the california democrat said his forces would make another attempt 
possibly today when the subcommittee considers more amendments 
to the administration plan 
many didnt want to go with our provisions he said but 
predicted some members might support a middleground something 
like the california standards 
california has the toughest auto pollution requirements in the 
country exceeding federal requirements for the rest of the nation 
because its ozone problem is so serious 
motor vehicle emissions are a prime source of ozone although 
some pollutants also contribute to the other problems the bill is 
trying to address acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals 
ozone is a highly reactive gas that is the prime ingredient of 
smog a term coined by combining smoke and fog ozone is produced 
by the combination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides in the 
presence of sunlight and heat both gases are produced from mobile 
sources cars trucks and buses but also from stationary sources 
major industrial plants such as utilities and some small 
businesses 
the outgunned waxman who is closely allied with environmental 
organizations conceded defeat without requesting a roll call 
sometimes you dont want them on record so they can rethink 
their position and come around said waxman who can renew his 
proposal in the full energy and commerce committee and the house 
floor if he loses in subcommittee the senate has not begun 
amending clean air legislation 
rep norman f lent rny the main gop sponsor of the bush 
legislation said waxmans proposals would have cost consumers an 
extra 500 per car if fully implemented by model year 2000 for 
that expense he said pollution under waxmans plan would only be 
cut an additional 27 percent compared to the bush proposal 
motor vehicles are mainly responsible for ozone pollution 
although some emissions also release toxic chemicals and a 
component of acid rain 
rep doug walgren dpa said he supported waxmans plan in 
order to send the right kind of signal to the auto industry 
and the public that congress backs the strictest limits 
but he added we dont know where those numbers are going to 
lead us 
the latter point was made repeatedly by lent who said the 
technology doesnt exist to meet the waxman standards but only is 
alive in the dreams of the authors of the amendment even 
california is smart enough not to adopt these standards he 
argued 
waxmans plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 025 
grams per mile from 1993 through 1999 and 0125 grams per mile 
after that 
nitrogen oxides an ingredient of acid rain would have been 
capped at 04 grams per mile from 199399 and 02 grams afterward 
carbon monoxide a toxic pollutant was set at 34 grams per 
mile from 199299 retaining current law and 17 grams afterward 
under the waxman proposal 
the bush standard for hydrocarbons is 025 grams per mile by 
1998 for nitrogen oxides 07 grams by the same year and 
retention of the current 34 gram carbon monoxide limit 
californias limits for hydrocarbons starting in 1995 will be 
025 grams per mile for 50000 miles and 031 grams between 50000 
and 100000 miles 
the states nitrogen oxide limit already in effect is 04 
grams up to 50000 miles the carbon monoxide standard now is 34 
grams but rises to 42 between 50000 and 100000 miles 
current federal law outside california requires car limits of 
041 grams per mile for hydrocarbons 1 gram for nitrogen oxides 
and 34 grams for carbon monoxide

the indictment of defense consultant 
thomas e muldoon will likely send prosecutors investigating 
pentagon procurement fraud to trial for the second time in the 
3yearold probe 
all but two of the 23 individuals convicted in the ill wind 
case have pleaded guilty but muldoons lawyer said tuesday that 
muldoon has already turned down a government offer to plead guilty 
and denies charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe a 
marine corps procurement official 
muldoon denies it all denies there was any criminal intent on 
his part at any time albert j ahern jr said his position 
from the very beginning is that he denied any bribery therefore he 
isnt going to plea to that 
court documents portray muldoon as a major figure in the defense 
procurement scandal operating in a network of people who got 
secret information on contracts from pentagon sources and sold it 
to companies seeking the military contracts 
he was charged tuesday after two former executives of whittaker 
command and control systems and the corporate unit itself pleaded 
guilty to participating in the bribery scheme with muldoon 
scott m lamberth the subsidiarys former president and john 
f van tassel once director of its fayetteville ark operations 
said they funneled more than 80000 in bribes to marine corps 
procurement official jack sherman through muldoon and two other 
defense consultants john marlowe and donald illeman 
marlowe is the governments original informant who led 
investigators to sherman who pleaded guilty to taking other bribes 
and received an 18month sentence 
according to court papers filed tuesday the bribery scheme 
began with a private company called lee telecommunications which 
whittaker corp purchased in 1986 and made a subsidiary 
in 1981 lee telecommunications arranged through muldoon to 
bribe sherman to help obtain a contract to provide an electronics 
component for a battlefield air traffic control system being 
developed by the marines according to the court papers 
over seven years lee paid 200000 to marlowe muldoon and 
illeman who shared their fees with sherman prosecutors say 
the marine corps official then authorized modifications in the 
companys contracts that brought their total value to 77 million 
indicted with muldoon on tuesday was leonard l ingram former 
vice president of lee telecommunications and later of the 
whittaker command subsidiary 
ingrams attorney marcus topel said ingram also wanted to 
stand trial 
i think this is a classic case of guilt by association the 
san francisco lawyer said i think the trial will show he had 
absolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities and 
at most was present at various times when they were discussed and 
did nothing further than that 
in the only other jury trial resulting from the investigation 
two teledyne electronics executives were convicted last spring of 
conspiracy and wire fraud but were cleared of charges they 
participated in a separate bribery scheme 
the guilty plea by the whittaker subsidiary is the third by a 
corporation in the case 
teledyne industries and hazeltine corp pleaded guilty in 
connection with their roles in the procurement scandal 
the whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay 35 million in fines and 
penalties according to court papers lamberth deliberately 
withheld information about the bribery scheme from whittaker corp 
officials in los angeles 
company attorney daniel h bookin told us district judge 
claude hilton whittaker officials in los angeles were unaware of 
the scheme no one who is involved in those activities is 
currently with the company he said

federal safety officials are blaming the pilot 
and copilot but not the third man in the cockpit for a delta 
airlines crash at dallasfort worth airport that killed 14 people 
the aug 18 1988 crash was caused by a lack of cockpit 
discipline the crews attempt to take off with wing flaps and 
slats in the wrong position and failure of an alarm system to warn 
that something was wrong the national transportation safety board 
concluded tuesday 
the board laid secondary blame on delta for sloppy cockpit 
procedures and training and on the federal aviation administration 
for failing to correct deltas known deficiencies 
board staff members who conducted the yearlong investigation 
said delta has since corrected the deficiencies 
board member james burnett dissented from the decision saying 
the conclusion let delta off too easily by citing it only for slow 
correction of problems during a period of rapid growth and merger 
he also said the board should have laid more direct blame on faa 
failures 
the responsibility here lies as much with the faa and delta as 
it does with the crew said burnett 
i couldnt be more strongly opposed to that view said james 
kolstad acting board chairman who pushed to leave out any 
criticism of the faa in the final statement 
delta conceded in july that errors by its flight crew in failing 
to set the boeing 727s flaps and slats in the proper takeoff 
position led to the crash 
a delta official attending the board meeting declined to comment 
on the boards decision 
the airliner taking off with more than 100 people on a flight 
for salt lake city was piloted by captain larry l davis 48 with 
first officer carey w kirkland 37 and second officer steven mark 
judd 30 in the cockpit 
delta fired all three cockpit crew members when the company 
accepted responsibility for the crash 
the boards assessment of probable cause did not include actions 
by judd who board members said was the only pilot to perform 
professionally during the takeoff 
they noted that judd failed to report a malfunctioning warning 
light but said monitoring the light was not his specific 
responsibility and he was performing all of his other duties 
board members in discussing the accident which destroyed the 
boeing jetliner criticized the presence of a flight attendant in 
the cockpit for 18 minutes just before the takeoff the board said 
davis and kirkland engaged in idle conversation when they should 
have been attending to takeoff preparations 
the board viewed computer animations of the planes flapsdown 
takeoff as its tail and a wing clipped the runway the animations 
prepared by the safety board staff also showed that the plane 
could have taken off safely if the captain had applied full 
throttle once he realized there was a problem getting lift but he 
failed to do so 
the plane plowed into the ground beyond the runway and burst 
into flames first reports from the control tower indicated the 
crash was nonsurvivable but more than 90 people crawled out 
of the wreckage and survived 
the board concluded that the jetliners takeoff warning system 
had an intermittent failure problem which was not corrected during 
its last maintenance and occurred again during the crash of flight 
1141 
the board whose conclusions carry no force of law recommended 
that the faa check the cockpit procedures employed by carriers and 
develop improvements in takeoff warning systems 
it also called for a governmentindustry task force to make 
rules for establishing flight safety programs at major airlines 
the air line pilots association criticized the board for 
stressing actions by the pilots rather than the malfunctioning 
takeoff warning system 
the group said the boards conclusion that the pilots failed to 
set the flaps is based largely on circumstantial evidence

millicent fenwick recalls a conversation with 
president ronald reagan during a flight from washington to new 
jersey when she promoted a proposal to develop an elderly housing 
complex in a town called ewing 
on the ground later reagan told a rally for fenwicks 1982 
senate campaign that the department of housing and urban 
development would fund the project the former gop congresswoman 
said tuesday 
i was absolutely stunned when he said that she said in a 
telephone interview given the events were hearing about today 
it makes me feel badly but at the time it seemed so innocent 
reagans decision to award subsidies to the new jersey project 
forced hud to withdraw a commitment to fund a north carolina 
project a democratic lawmaker said in contending reagan used the 
agency to boost mrs fenwicks unsuccessful campaign 
i cant seen how it could be any more political said rep 
thomas lantos dcalif contending the example showed hud how 
political favoritism permeated hud during the reagan administration 
lantos made the charge at a hearing at which former hud 
secretary samuel pierce invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination to refuse to answer to answer questions about 
his eightyear tenure 
the project that lost its funding to the new jersey facility now 
figures prominently in questions about pierces conduct at hud the 
converted hosiery mill in durham nc was funded five years later 
over the objections of agency experts 
reagan announced the new jersey award at a sept 17 1982 
campaign appearance for fenwick who said she had failed in 1981 to 
convince hud officials to support the ewing development 
the same day reagan made the announcement a deputy wrote a memo 
to pierce saying hud had received a call from the white house 
the president who is en route to new jersey has agreed to 
fund with section 8 new construction funds the 125unit housing 
project in ewing near trenton the memo said 
on the bottom of the memo the word noted is scribbled 
alongside pierces initials 
the memo taken from pierces files was released by the 
subcommittee 
stuart weisberg the subcommittee staff director and chief 
counsel said other hud documents obtained by the panel indicate 
hud because of reagans promise in new jersey withdrew a 
commitment to provide subsidies to the durham hosiery mill 
the durham project was ultimately given more than 11 million in 
hud financing in 1987 despite the objections of agency officials 
a former pierce deputy shirley wiseman told congress she 
refused to sign the funding papers even after pierce ordered her to 
do so pierce in a recent interview with time magazine said he 
had overruled senior staff to fund the durham project 
reagan spokesman mark weinberg said he was not familiar with the 
project cited by lantos we wouldnt comment on a pending 
congressional investigation anyway said weinberg

percent drugfree 
random drug tests on 15352 department workers most of them in 
sensitive jobs at the federal aviation administration turned up 
illegal drug use in 99 the transportation department said monday 
the 99 positive results were 06 percent of the total tests 
conducted between jan 1 1988 and april 30 1989 according to the 
departments drugfree workplace program evaluation report for 
marijuana use accounted 
september 1989for approximately twothirds of 
positives with cocaine for all but a small percentage of the 
rest the report says 
the department said it spent 4 million on its antidrug program 
in the 1988 fiscal year which ended last sept 30 covering 
collection laboratory testing staff support and informational 
services according to the report 
federal aviation administration employees accounted for 95 
percent of those tested under the random testing program which

secretary of state james a baker iii is using 
his meetings here with foreign ministers to appeal for private 
contributions to defeat daniel ortega the sandinista president of 
nicaragua us officials say 
he made the request of the foreign ministers of japan and west 
germany on tuesday and he did make it with others the 
officials said in confirming a japanese report 
baker did not specify how much of a contribution the bush 
administration wanted for violeta chamorro the newspaper publisher 
who is running against ortega and he was given no commitments by 
the ministers said the officials who demanded anonymity 
last week baker abandoned a plan to have the national endowment 
for democracy make contributions to mrs chamorros campaign to 
defeat ortega in next years presidential election in nicaragua 
baker concluded such use of the group went beyond its 
congressional charter the national endowment for democracy will 
participate in poll watching as it has done in panama chile and 
other countries 
appealing to the foreign ministers to arrange private 
contributions was something that was suggested by some members of 
the democratic leadership when we talked with them about ned 
funding an official said 
baker asked japanese foreign minister taro nakayana to use his 
influence with the liberal democratic party to obtain contributions 
for mrs chamorros campaign the officials said 
baker made an indirect approach also to hansdietrich genscher 
the west german foreign minister at a separate meeting the 
officials said 
the free democrats have ties to one political institute and the 
christian democrats to another one 
its an effort that we are making and an effort that we will 
pursue the official said 
it wasnt just funds said another us official this 
came up in several meetings he also has encouraged people if they 
wished to send election observers to have visits down there so it 
wasnt just funds 
baker is in new york to attend the special session of the united 
nations general assembly but he is spending most of the week 
meeting with dozens of foreign ministers here for the session 
baker also met tuesday with foreign ministers krzysztof 
skubiszewski of poland and gyuia horn of hungary 
the us officials said the pole outlined a major overhaul 
of the east european countrys monetary policy and economic 
structure 
were very pleased to see that because we see it as moving in 
the direction that we had set out from the very start which is to 
try and build an effective private sector to try and deal with 
problems an official said 
the plan he said is designed to cope with inflation now about 
40 percent a month and to promote private enterprise 
the program impressed baker and his aides but the officials 
declined to say whether it would cause the bush administration to 
increase aid to poland 
president bush has asked congress for 119 million in 
developmental assistance last week bowing to pressure from 
congress an additional 50 million in food aid was tacked on 
still the senate foreign relations committee led by the 
democrats approved a nearly 12 billion threeyear aid package 
for poland and hungary 
i think from the outline of what weve seen its a very 
positive development the official said of the polish program

another oil pressure problem according to the pentagon 
a sept 21 flight was scrubbed after three hours after 
indications of low oil pressure in the planes no 1 airframe 
accessory drive said pentagon spokesman pete williams a similar 
problem had forced cancellation of a flight on aug 16 
a flight saturday ended after 77 minutes because of gusty 
winds at the altitude at which the plane was flying william 
said adding that he could not say what the wind strengths were 
the batwinged bomber is designed to pass through enemy radar 
virtually undetected the accessory drive is the gear box that 
powers the jets generators and controls 
the government has spent about 224 billion in the b2 program 
which is 18 months behind schedule and congress has balked at 
paying more than 500 million each for 132 bombers

a genetic abnormality that appears to play a 
role in many common cancers has been solidly linked to lung cancer 
raising hopes of improved diagnosis and treatment scientists say 
researchers examining lung cancer tumors discovered a series of 
abnormalities in the socalled p53 anticancer gene according to a 
report tuesday by dr john minna of the national cancer 
institutenavy medical oncology branch in bethesda md 
defects in the gene also have been linked to colon cancer to an 
uncommon bone cancer called osteogenic sarcoma and to chronic 
myelogenous leukemia minna said 
obviously everybody is going to be looking for it in 
everything else minna said 
bert vogelstein of johns hopkins university in baltimore who 
identified p53 abnormalities in colon cancer said from what 
ive heard of dr minnas work it seems quite clear that the p53 
gene will play an important role in lung tumors 
current evidence suggests that p53 is likely to play a role in 
many common cancers including breast cancer ovarian cancer and 
bladder cancer he said 
during the past few years researchers have found indirect 
evidence that defects in at least six genes can contribute to lung 
cancer which afflicts an estimated 150000 americans a year 
the new study has pinpointed chemical changes in one of those 
genes that should be useful for identifying people at high risk of 
getting lung cancer or for predicting how deadly a particular case 
of lung cancer will be minna said 
one thing you could do would be to take peoples tumors see 
how many genetic lesions they have and determine how virulent 
they are minna said tuesday in a telephone interview from 
toronto where he presented his findings at the bristolmyers 
cancer research symposium 
vogelstein has found that the more genetic abnormalities a colon 
cancer tumor has the more virulent it is minna said 
minna said he is beginning studies to determine if the same 
thing is true in lung cancer 
determination of a tumors virulence could lead to better 
decisions on treatment he said 
minna also said screening for genetic abnormalities in people 
who dont have lung cancer could reveal those who are about to get 
cancer that is people who have some but not all of the genetic 
changes needed to produce a tumor such people could be followed 
closely for the appearance of tumors he said 
the protein made by the p53 gene located on chromosome 17 
normally protects the body against cancer if the protein is 
defective the protective effect is lost and one step has been 
taken toward the formation of a tumor minna explained the gene is 
called an anticancer gene because it normally protects against 
cancer 
minna said that although only six genetic abnormalities have so 
far been linked to lung cancer there may be as many as 10 or 20 
most of the evidence for the six abnormalities already found 
consists of studies with genetic signposts called restriction 
fragment length polymorphisms these studies show the approximate 
location of the abnormalities on chromosomes but do not reveal 
precisely what the abnormalities are 
the p53 gene is the second anticancer gene to be carefully 
studied minna said the first was a gene identified in 
retinoblastoma a rare childrens eye cancer the retinoblastoma 
gene also was shown recently to be important in lung cancer minna 
said

a palestinianamerican accused of participating 
in a deadly terrorist attack on a bus in israel should be 
extradited to the jewish state to face trial a federal judge ruled 
mahmoud elabed ahmad 36 hasnt been charged in the united 
states but has been imprisoned nearly 2 years while attorneys 
argued whether he would get a fair trial in israel 
us district judge jack b weinstein ruled tuesday that ahmad 
should be extradited but then delayed the order for 10 days to 
allow an appeal 
american and israeli authorities say ahmad played a major part 
in a 1986 firebomb and machine gun attack on a bus killing four 
israelis 
ahmads lawyer former us attorney general ramsey clark said 
ahmad did not participate in the attack but was implicated by two 
cousins after they were tortured by israeli security agents 
in his ruling weinstein said ahmad failed to show he would be 
subject to procedures or treatment so offensive to our nations 
sense of decency as to obligate the court to block his 
extradition 
clark was in los angeles on tuesday and did not immediately 
return a call for comment clark has said he would appeal if 
weinstein ruled for extradition 
weinstein also rejected an argument that the bus attack was a 
political act that would exempt ahmad from extradition 
were a civilian to detonate a bomb in a peaceful marketplace 
or rake peaceful shoppers with a machine gun to make a political 
point this and most civilized countries would not consider such 
indiscriminate violence an unpunishable political act weinstein 
said 
ahmad who israeli authorities sometimes refer to as mahmoud 
abed atta is charged with taking part in an april 12 1986 attack 
in which three terrorists hurled molotov cocktails and then opened 
fire with machine guns on a bus carrying jewish settlers in the 
occupied west bank 
ahmad who israel says is a member of the abu nidal palestinian 
terrorist group was born in the west bank town of ramallah and 
became a us citizen seven years ago his last job was working at 
his brothers filling station in puerto rico 
according to travel documents he was visiting his family in the 
west bank at the time of the attack but he denies involvement 
he was arrested upon entering venezuela in april 1987 that 
country did not have an extradition treaty with israel and he was 
handed over to us authorities clark said that was illegal

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze has hailed president bushs call for the superpowers 
to destroy most of their chemical weapons but says washington 
should go further and agree to stop making all types of poison gas 
in his speech tuesday to the general assembly shevardnadze also 
challenged the united states to join the soviets in halting all 
nuclear tests and ending the production of weaponsgrade plutonium 
and uranium 
shevardnadzes address was a rapid reply to bushs offer in a 
speech to the assembly on monday to cut us chemical weapons 
stockpiles by 80 percent if the soviets reduce their arsenal to the 
same level 
the soviet envoy said moscow is ready to join the united states 
and radically reduce or completely destroy all its chemical 
weapons even before an international treaty is adopted 
he said the soviets had stopped producing some chemical weapons 
already and challenged washington to do the same 
cease the production of chemical weapons as we have done 
already i am referring also to binary weapons said 
shevardnadze binary weapons are harmless until two chemicals are 
combined just prior to use of the gas shell 
congress has approved funds to continue production of binary 
poison gas bombs and shells 
viktor p karpov the soviet unions chief arms control expert 
said it will not be sufficient only to get rid of old weapons if 
the united states is going to produce new chemical weapons 
it was not clear from shevardnadzes address whether soviet 
cooperation with a weapons cut hinged on washington agreeing to end 
poison gas production the speech seemed deliberately vague on that 
point 
at white house bush said tuesday the reaction from the 
soviets to our proposals yesterday has been positive so now the 
goal is to get moving and try to work out these agreements 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called 
shevardnadzes statements a very constructive response our 
ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons and it 
appears that both nations are now ready to act 
bushs proposal is intended to spur a 40nation conference in 
geneva to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years 
the soviets would have to scrap more poison gas as us 
officials contend moscow has far greater stockpiles than washington 
an acknowledged 50000 tons compared to an estimated 30000 tons 
for the united states 
bush proposed a ussoviet agreement to begin those cuts at 
once while an international treaty is worked out in which the 
united states would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over 
eight years if the soviets joined the ban 
the remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if 
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban 
speaking to delegates of 159 nations on tuesday shevardnadze 
also said moscow is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all 
nuclear explosions any day and hour if the united states 
reciprocates 
he said moscow was considering extending the 1963 nuclear test 
ban treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions 
in another disarmament proposal shevardnadze said that if 
nato countries agree to start talks on tactical shortrange 
nuclear weapons the ussr will respond by further unilateral cuts 
in its tactical nuclear weapons in europe 
he also proposed that the production of nuclear fissionable 
material for weapons be halted and that the ban be verified 
the soviet union has announced it is halting the production of 
enriched uranium 
the weekend agreement that bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will hold a summit meeting shows that we have moved 
quite far ahead in solving a number of major bilateral and 
international problems shevardnadze said 
in our view by the time the summit is held next year in late 
spring or early summer we may have passed the last turn on the 
road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms or 
longrange nuclear missiles by 50 percent 
in a speech that praised the right of a people to choose its 
government and course of development shevardnadze also wished 
every success to polands new government the first east bloc 
government not led by communists 
he pledged to cooperate with it 
shevardnadze denounced the socalled movements that allow 
actions humiliating other nations or use terrorist barbaric and 
inhuman methods in waging their struggle a pointed reference to 
kidnappings by shiite moslem extremists in lebanon and palestinian 
guerrilla attacks on israel

under a bill being taken up by 
parliament hungarians will now be able to speak their mind and 
agitate for political and social change without fear of 
prosecution the countrys justice minsiter says 
the amendment to the penal code to be debated today is just 
another step toward the greater democracy promised by hungarys 
communist leaders as they prepare for the free elections they have 
promised by june 
the bill is part of a package of legislation now before 
parliament that is designed to prepare the east bloc country for a 
multiparty system and bring its laws in line with international 
covenants on human rights 
with poland hungary is taking advantage of moscows greater 
tolerance to end decades of oneparty authoritarian rule 
as parliament convened tuesday it adopted important new bills 
that will liberalize travel and emigration removing most 
restrictions on hungarians wishing to travel or live abroad 
justice minister kalman kulcsar told parliament that with the 
broadening of civic rights the penal code must be appropriately 
reformed 
he said the amendment to be debated today aimed to guarantee 
greater freedom for political activity 
kulscar said a comprehensive reform of the penal code was under 
way but that the amendments now before parliament addressed certain 
urgent problems that could not wait 
hungarys rapid liberalization has allowed a degree of free 
expression that would have been difficult even one year ago 
opposition leaders are now quoted in the official media and in 
most instances people are permitted to demonstrate freely on a 
wide range of issues including such sensitive topics as the 
withdrawal of soviet troops 
the communist party has agreed to relinquish its leading role 
and enter into free elections with independent parties even 
pledging to go into opposition if it loses 
the communists have also sat down with opposition groups and 
parties to work out the transition to a multiparty system and the 
countrys first free elections in more than 40 years 
the legislation now before parliament at this session is partly 
a result of agreements reached at those talks 
other key bills are to be taken up by parliament in october 
they will include bills on political parties electoral law and 
changes in the judiciary a measure on changes in the constitution 
will remove references to the leading role of the communist party 
officials say 
the emigration and travel laws adopted tuesday lifted most 
restrictions on travel and guarantee the right of hungarians to 
choose freely their desired place of residence to leave and return 
to their own country 
interior minister istvan horvath said hungarians who had 
emigrated for personal or even for political reasons would be 
allowed to return at any time 
he said 19 restrictive measures would be removed when the laws 
take effect jan 1 
hungarys liberal policies on travel have already been 
illustrated by the governments decision in may to remove barbed 
wire and other barriers along its border with austria 
the budapest leadership angered its hardline east german 
czechoslovak and romanian allies earlier this month when it decided 
to open its borders to thousands of east germans seeking to 
emigrate to the west

a renewed fight over the teaching of 
evolution and creationism in california will have a crucial test 
this week in a battle that has national implications 
the focal point is the upcoming adoption of a new science 
curriculum framework a detailed statement of what should be taught 
in california and how it should be taught 
the framework doesnt mandate course content which is 
determined by the states 1030 local school boards but it sets 
standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective 
as mandates 
in 1985 california education authorities drew national 
attention by successfully demanding that publishers devote more 
space to evolution the revised textbooks are now being used in 
schools across the nation 
the new proposal would strengthen the teaching of evolution 
if adopted it would be a national victory for science over 
dogma said michael hudson western states director for the 
washingtonbased people for the american way a 270000member 
advocacy group for civil and constitutional liberty issues 
the teaching of evolution is so entrenched in california that 
fundamentalist christians who support creationist theory arent 
trying to exclude it they hope to persuade the state to recommend 
that students hear differing views on evolution 
material should be included in the textbooks by various 
scientists who say that evolution cannot be substantiated if 
credible competing views are not discussed and evolution is spoken 
of as a theory with no critical information provided the textbooks 
will present evolution dogmatically said the rev louis sheldon 
chairman of the traditional values coalition a coalition of 6000 
california churches 
but bill honig the state superintendent of public instruction 
and the major force behind californias drive to strengthen the 
teaching of evolution contends no credible scientific evidence 
refutes evolution 
honig said evolution belongs in science classes because there is 
hard scientific evidence to back it and creation theory belongs in 
philosophy or history classes because it is based on faith and is 
part of western cultural heritage 
evolution teaches that the earth is billions of years old and 
that life forms gradually began developing millions of years ago 
creationscience is linked closely to a literal translation of 
the biblical book of genesis teaching that the earth and most of 
its life forms came into existence suddenly more than 5000 years 
ago 
the science subcommittee of the state curriculum commission will 
hold its final hearing on the proposed new framework thursday with 
a vote scheduled friday if approved the state board of education 
will hold a hearing on it in october and vote in november 
the proposal which a panel of 18 prominent educators has been 
working on for 1 years includes revised recommendations on dozens 
of scientific subjects such as physics and aids 
but evolution remains the only hotly debated topic said glenn 
thomas manager of the state office of curriculum frameworks and 
textbook development 
it pulls together all that we have been trying to do into one 
strong document it clearly states why evolution is a necessary 
organizing framework an essential foundation in teaching the 
sciences thomas said 
earlier this decade the state declared that evolution must be 
taught in 1985 educators adopted a new list of approved textbooks 
and pressured publishers for more emphasis on evolution since most 
publishers sell the same textbook to schools across the country 
the revisions california sought appear in books used in schools 
nationwide thomas said

says is urgently needed so that economic instability does not 
threaten the countries reforms 
wrapping up a daylong meeting of 24 major noncommunist donor 
nations on ways to encourage democratic reform in eastern europe 
senior eec officials also urged that poland and hungary work out 
agreements with the international monetary fund to reschedule their 
foreign debts

billion and poland owes a debilitating 39 billion 
tuesday marked the second time the 24 nations have met to 
discuss aid to eastern europe and they are scheduled to meet again 
in november the first meeting was held aug 1 
a communique issued at the end of the meeting noted that 
noncommunist nations have already pledged 271 million in food aid 
to poland and hungary 
of the 648 million in aid for next year half would be financed 
by the 12 european community member nations and the remainder by 
the 12 other donor nations all donor nations and the european 
parliament must approve the proposals 
the us delegation did not pledge more aid than the 169 
million already promised but indicated it could find additional

at 3537057 on tuesday it had gained 48411 points the 
secondlargest oneday gain this year reaching a high of 3544482 
the index had gained 97424 points over four trading days 
the dollar closed at 14135 yen down 145 yen from tuesdays

yen and 14162 yen 
the dollars close today was its lowest since 14010 yen on aug 
11 
the us currency now has fallen 365 yen in the three trading 
days since seven major industrial nations agreed to cooperate in 
checking the dollars recent rise the agreement was followed by 
coordinated dollar selling by central banks traders said 
the bank of japan was selling dollars again today but the 
amount was unknown said masafumi koyama a bank of tokyo trader 
the central bank does not comment on its exchange market 
activities 
koyama said the dollar was unlikely to fall much below 140 yen 
since an excessive fall over a short period would be unfavorable 
for the international economy 
in addition considering that the dollars recent fall has 
been mainly prompted by the central banks coordinated 
intervention it will not last long because its impossible for the 
banks to keep selling the dollar every day forever koyama said 
as soon as they stop the dollarselling operation the 
currency will start rising back he said 
on the stock exchange the major reason for the indexs fall 
today was too much gain yesterday said tomoyuki morimoto a 
dealer with new japan securities co ltd he said investors sold to 
take profits after tuesdays substantial gains 
the rumor that west germany might raise its interest rate also 
discouraged investors he said

johannesburg formally opened 
all public facilities to blacks today after the city council voted 
to desegregate buses swimming pools and recreation centers 
the move was approved at a city council meeting tuesday night 
despite strong opposition from members of the farright 
conservative party who favor strict segregation 
we are taking a large step in south african terms said 
council member harold rudolph who voted in favor of integration 
i am so glad we are putting right that which was wrong 
most public facilities in major cities have been desegregated in 
recent years either informally or by the repeal of apartheid 
legislation 
however the councils decision marked the first formal 
declaration to integrate all public facilities controlled by the 
city cape town already has taken similiar steps 
the councils decision does not affect schools neighborhoods or 
hospitals which are segregated by national and provincial laws 
also private facilities may be segregated under the separate 
amenities act 
earlier this year the johannesburg city council polled white 
voters on the question of integration most said they approved of 
desegregated buses and recreation centers but almost 60 percent 
were opposed to opening swimming pools to blacks 
we know integration is going create problems but these are 
manageable problems and we will rise to the challenge said 
council member ian davidson 
the five freedoms forum an antiapartheid group said it 
welcomed the councils decision 
if facilities controlled by the council can be opened so then 
can the facilities such as hospitals and schools that are 
controlled by the central and provincial governments the group 
said 
antiapartheid groups launched a nationwide defiance campaign on 
aug 2 that has targeted segregated schools neighborhoods 
beaches buses and other facilities 
a major demonstration is planned saturday at beaches near cape 
town where last month police used batons whips and tear gas to 
disperse blacks who attempted to march on whitesonly beaches 
the beaches fall under the jurisdiction of provincial authorities 
not the city council 
johannesburg along with durban and cape town are considered 
the most liberal cities in the country towns just outside 
johannesburg such as boksburg have been reimposing rigid 
apartheid since the conservative party won control of some local 
councils in municipal elections a year ago 
in boksburg and elsewhere blacks have been barred from public 
parks and other facilities that had been integrated for several 
years 
the johannesburg city council is controlled by the national 
party which has governed south africa for 41 years and codified 
apartheid laws in the early 1950s 
president fw de klerk who was sworn into office last week 
said his government seeks to end discrimination but he has not 
specified any apartheid laws that he will repeal 
he also has said he favors segregated schools and neighborhoods 
for whites who want them 
tens of thousands of blacks have moved illegally into 
whitesonly neighborhoods in inner cities the government has 
virtually stopped prosecutions under the law that segregates 
residential areas and says it is considering opening some 
neighborhoods to all races

shrimpers whose families have made a 
living off the sea for generations are vowing to return even 
though hurricane hugo wiped out shrimp beds and tossed around their 
trawlers like toys 
im going to have to get my house straight and my boat 
straight and i reckon ill have to go south for shrimping said 
charles sellers 37 a shrimper for 14 years 
but he added ill be back 
generations of families have made their livelihoods shrimping 
the marshes and creeks of the intracoastal waterway hugo with its 
135 mph winds and 17foot tidal surge destroyed the shrimp beds in 
this fishing village of 500 at the height of the season 
shrimpers said the harvest this year had been one of the best 
before hugo struck with daily catches running at 300 pounds to 500 
pounds which is double last years the shrimping season runs from 
may to november 
shrimping is a 30 million a year industry along the coast and 
the fishermen arent the only ones to suffer 
the biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp the packing 
houses theyre all wiped out theyre destroyed said jimmy 
scott 45 a shrimper for the past 21 years by the time they get 
it built back the season is over 
his 68foot boat the mary margaret lay stranded on the main 
approach to the dock its riggings were tangled with a battered oak 
tree 
scott said hell still live in mcclellanville but will have to 
find another place to shrimp 
im born and raised here ive got to stay here he said 
the town three miles from the ocean was founded in the early 
1800s by planters who wanted to escape the intense summertime heat 
it evolved into a quaint village of mossdraped oak trees and 
narrow streets with many of its residents making their living 
catching shrimp oysters and fish 
thomas colleton and his family of nine weathered the storm in 
their home two miles from the water colleton 57 who works for 
other shrimpers said he was unsure when he would work again 
wayne potters 60foot trawler was destroyed and he lost his 
house in the storm but potter who has been a shimper for 35 years 
like his father and grandfather before him cannot imagine a life 
away from the sea 
nor can other shrimpers he said 
theyre going to stick with it as soon as they get their 
boats back in shape theyre going to get right back into 
business potter said

john ring and his sister marie were mostly 
homebodies but they kept up appearances by dressing well going to 
church every sunday and sending bouquets of flowers to neighbors 
every christmas and easter 
only when marie ring died friday of hardening of the arteries at 
age 58 did their hermitlike existence become known 
inside their threestory row house the reclusive siblings lived 
in what had become a kind of urban cave with two dozen cats they 
had no running water electricity or heat 
they also had a third sibling 62yearold vincent who 
apparently never went outside 
police said they found marie dead and 59yearold john and 
vincent in poor mental condition the brothers refused to leave the 
house but were sent to boston city hospital for evaluation a 
hospital spokeswoman would say only that they were in stable 
condition and that doctors had forbidden interviews 
but in an interview with the boston globe in tuesdays editions 
john ring said the cats took all our money cost us 60 a 
week worth of cat food thats why we couldnt fix the place up 
but were gonna now 
the city though has boarded up and condemned the house 
and the animal rescue league has taken the cats 
gerri abban the cashier at bells market near the house said 
the rings would not let anyone into their home she asked city 
counselors and priests to help them but they told her the family 
had a right to privacy 
ms abban said she and her bosses matthew cohen and his son 
alan were able to provide some assistance 
i sold them charcoal in the winter so they could heat the 
house ms abban said i sold them rubbing alcohol five 
bottles at a time so they could cook i sold them bottle after 
bottle of anacin because theyd get wicked headaches from the smell 
in the house paper plates paper cups bottled water it was 
unbelievable 
their toilets didnt flush they used candles and flashlights 
and they cooked meals in a pan on an alcohol burner 
i couldnt believe it said matthew ryan a 72yearold 
retired union leader who has lived next door to the rings for about 
30 years who could get by today without electricity and gas and 
water i would have helped them but they werent people who 
wanted you to get involved 
john ring told the globe that vincent was wounded in world war 
ii and hadnt worked since 1953 marie quit working in 1957 and 
john hasnt had a job since 1961 they had lived in the house with 
their parents who died more than 10 years ago 
ryan said he thought vincent had died until a fire broke out in 
two nearby houses 15 years ago 
he saw a man with a beard down to his belt and a blanket over 
his head i said who is that and someone said thats 
vincent i never believed there was a third person in there 
matthew cohen proprietor of bells since 1956 said the rings 
paid with personal checks that occasionally bounced cohen who 
gave them discounts said the brothers received disability checks 
or veterans checks or something 
he tried to send an electrician and a plumber to their house 
but the rings wouldnt let them in he knew john ring was on 
medication and when he was off it 
if john didnt take his medication he went wild when hed 
come down to the store to buy hed stuff his pockets hed throw 
things around and yell at people we understood him we did the 
best we could we got him home 
cohen said marie ring once an accountant was a very fine 
lady always wellspoken she seemed to be wellread and her whole 
life was taking care of her two brothers its a mystery to me why 
but she did it

a band of chippewa indians has agreed 
to curtail its spearfishing and other treaty rights in exchange for 
an expected multimilliondollar aid package 
the tentative accord tuesday came after months of negotiations 
by the state with leaders of the lac du flambeau chippewa band 
whose spring spearfishing has sparked widespread and sometimes 
violent protests by treaty rights opponents 
if approved by tribal members and the legislature the agreement 
would be the first reached between the state and its six chippewa 
bands the mole lake band reached a tentative agreement with the 
state but that 10 million 10year deal was voted down by tribal 
members in january 
treaty rights of the chippewa to hunt and fish on 
nonreservation lands across much of northern wisconsin have been 
upheld in a series of federal court rulings since 1983 
state attorney general donald hanaway said the tentative 
agreement with the lac du flambeau would span 10 years and include 
a trust fund for the band 
the lac du flambeau the most active chippewa band in 
spearfishing would continue ceremonial spearfishing but agreed 
to forebear and forego the exercise of their treaty rights 
hanaway said 
both sides declined to disclose details 
lac du flambeau leaders had been seeking a 10year deal worth 
42 million including payments of about 1400 per individual 
member the state recently added other provisions reportedly worth 
up to 10 million 
hanaway said he hoped to have the tentative agreement in writing 
within a week and have a final document ready for the legislature 
by midoctober 
gov tommy g thompson said he supported the tentative accord 
but some legislators expressed caution 
assembly minority leader david prosser called the agreement an 
encouraging sign but sen joseph leean said it probably would 
take one heck of a sell job for him to support it 
he said voters did not believe we ought to have to ante up 
millions of dollars when the problem was created by federal 
treaties 
michael allen tribal chairman said the tribal council approved 
of the package and he planned to take it to members for a vote 
james klauser state administration secretary and thompsons 
chief adviser said the fund would be administered by trustees and 
the money would be used for education law enforcement health and 
economic development programs 
the accord could serve as a model for the states other five 
chippewa bands said james jannetta lac du flambeau tribal 
attorney 
hopefully other bands will look at this as a historic step 
he said 
spearfishing by the chippewas prompted demonstrations at some 
northern boat landings by hundreds of people in recent years 
opposition to spearfishing grew even more heated this year after 
the state announced it would reduce walleye pike catch limits for 
sport anglers the announcement followed a federal court ruling 
that allowed the chippewa to spear as many of the fish that 
biologists determined could be taken from the lakes without hurting 
the fish population 
last springs spearfishing season was marked by incidents of 
namecalling and rockthrowing at some lakes and resulted in about 
200 arrests 
federal court rulings since 1983 upheld provisions of 19th 
century treaties that allow the chippewa to fish hunt trap and 
harvest wild grain on nonreservation lands across most of northern 
wisconsin

a man under investigation in the green 
river serial slayings of up to 48 young women pleaded innocent to 
possession of a firearm while a fugitive 
william jay stevens ii finished a sentence for burglary and 
escape in seattle on monday and was brought here tuesday by federal 
marshals said deputy us marshal marvin lutes 
magistrate james hovis entered a plea of innocent on behalf of 
stevens to the charge of being a felon and fugitive in possession 
of a firearm 
roger peven a courtappointed defense attorney said he would 
move today for a bail hearing to win stevens release 
the green river task force has characterized stevens as a 
viable suspect in its investigation into the deaths of 40 women 
and the disappearances of eight others in the northwest from 
198284 
stevens has not been charged in any of the killings and has 
denied he is the killer 
a 45caliber colt handgun found in a house where stevens was 
arrested in january is the basis for the federal charge he was 
arrested for a 1981 escape from a work release center where he was 
serving a burglary sentence 
if convicted on the weapon possession charge stevens faces a 
maximum 10 year prison term and 250000 fine

this island towns oneroom onepupil 
school has hired its one teacher a former professor with a 
doctorate in education 
eloise seifert of centerville the former education coordinator 
of schools in coastal scituate beat out a field of applicants from 
around the country for the 24000 job on the island which has a 
yearround population of 50 people 
we got applications from people who didnt have any 
credentials but figured we might get stuck and people who just 
decided it looked like a pleasant place to be for a year said 
russell latham superintendent of the berkleygosnold schools 
seifert an owner of a barnstable cleaning business who received 
her doctorate from boston university also has been a university 
professor in new york and a reading specialist in the needham 
public schools 
its assumed by some that its a snap latham said but 
its quite a job to offer a young man a chance to do some 
independent work when there are only two of you in the room and to 
plan interesting things all the time 
island life also may be an adjustment the only telephone is a 
pay phone at the general store and a ferry to the mainland runs 
only on tuesdays and fridays in the winter 
gosnold is the only town on cuttyhunk island a popular summer 
tourist spot about 15 miles southwest of woods hole the town has 
an innrestaurant a bakery and delistyle sandwich shop the 
general store municipal offices and a library 
in the 1930s as many as 17 students were enrolled in gosnolds 
centuryold school house but this year like last only one 
youngster is in school and it may close in 1991 when the 
13yearold seventh grader attends high school on the mainland 
the school probably will close unless some family presents a 
child latham said

government troops waging a campaign 
against sinhalese militants today began observing a threeday 
ceasefire but extremists ignored the truce killing at least two 
people 
the government had hoped the ceasefire would encourage members 
of the militant peoples liberation front to open peace talks with 
the sinhalesedominated government 
but less than four hours after the ceasefire began at 6 am 
sinhalese extremists shot and killed two bodyguards of jayasinghe 
bandara a member of the governments provincial council military 
officials said 
the gunmen ambushed bandaras car about 80 miles east of colombo 
but he escaped unharmed said the officials who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules 
sinhalese radicals also set fire to three governmentowned buses 
in central sri lanka but there were no casualties they said 
the ceasefire was ordered one week after indian peacekeeping 
soldiers suspended military operations against minority tamil 
rebels demanding a separate homeland in the northeast 
tamil separatists have so far honored a truce called for in the 
agreement under which the 42000 remainingindian troops are to be 
out of the country by years end 
the decision to call the threeday ceasefire was made during a 
meeting last week between president ranasinghe premadasa and the 
five major opposition party leaders 
it was agreed as an immediate step to call upon all armed 
militant groups to desist from acts of violence and sabotage 
officials said in a statement if the armed militant groups 
respond favorably to this call this period of three days would 
be extended 
the ceasefire was one of 10 proposals in an oppositionproposed 
plan aimed at ending the campaign of strikes assassinations and 
terror inspired by the sinhalese militants 
the peoples liberation front began its antigovernment campaign 
after sri lanka signed a peace accord in july 1987 aimed at ending 
the tamil insurgency by offering the tamils limited autonomy if 
they would give up their weapons 
troops from neighboring india were invited in to supervise the 
surrender 
but the sinhalese militants said the accord offered too many 
concessions to the mainly hindu tamils who comprise 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people 
tamils claim they are denied jobs and education by the 
mostlybuddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population 
and dominate the government and military 
sinhalese militants also objected to the presence of indian 
peacekeeping troops saying it threatened the countrys sovereignty 
more than 11000 people including 1000 indian peacekeeping 
troops have been killed in the tamil insurgency since it started 
in 1983 more than 5000 others have died in the sinhalese backlash 
more than 200000 leaflets in the sinhalese language were 
dropped from airplanes by government troops tuesday over remote 
villages the leaflets offered up to 20000 rupees 510 to 
extremists who surrender 
it is foolish to destroy young lives in this way you are 
destroying the future of the countrys youth take advantage of 
this opportunity and give yourselves up you will be warmly 
received and fully protected the leaflets said 
there were no reports of any surrender but officials said it 
was too early for reports to come in

gay rights and aids activists blocked the entrance 
to the dallas county health department with 90 dummies to protest 
the start of a federal doortodoor aids survey 
the time for studies is passed the time for action is now 
activists chanted tuesday as they blocked the health department 
door with shirts and pants that were sewn up and stuffed to 
resemble bodies 
the number of dummies represented the number of people who will 
die of aids in dallas county during the survey period said william 
waybourn president of the dallas gay alliance 
there is an aids death in dallas county every day waybourn 
said 
the us department of health and human services approved last 
month a survey of dallas county residents over a three to 
fourmonth period in an attempt to determine the countys rate of 
aids infection 
the survey of 3400 households also is intended to determine the 
feasibility of a national aids survey next year 
the survey asks one adult in each of the households to take a 
blood test for the aids virus and answer questions about sexual 
habits and drug use a pilot study was conducted in pennsylvanias 
allegheny county early this year and 85 percent of the 308 eligible 
residents approached participated 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the hiv or 
human immunodeficiency virus the virus damages the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and 
cancer 
proponents say the survey will shape government spending on aids 
prevention and treatment 
at this point the only solid numbers that we have deal with 
aids patients not with hivinfected persons said dr gordon 
green director of the dallas county health department

peace activist abie nathan pleaded guilty 
today to breaking an israeli law that bans contacts with the pl0 
but said he would keep defying such laws in his quest for peace 
with the arabs 
nathan 63 who operates the pirate radio station voice of 
peace was indicted last year for meeting plo chief yasser arafat 
and several of his aides in tunisia and france in september 1988 
i knew about the law and i know that it entailed punishment 
but i acted in order to save the lives of people and i am prepared 
to break the law to acheive this nathan said in an emotional 
plea to the court 
i think i convinced our main enemy to grasp the olive 
branch nathan said i dont think i did any harm to israels 
security 
the law forbids unauthorized contacts with terrorist groups 
and provides for a maximum three year jail sentence the plo is not 
named in the law but israel considers the group a terrorist 
organization 
on wednesday the jerusalem post reported that two palestinians 
from the occupied west bank met with arafat abroad recently with 
the knowledge of israels defense ministry 
it quoted an israeli source as saying the government does not 
encourage such meetings but does not punish palestinians for taking 
part 
nathans sentencing was scheduled for tuesday 
prosecuting attorney raanan ben yosef asked for a stiff 
sentence saying nathans meetings abroad harmed israels security 
by legitimatizing terrorist organizations and serving to 
dedemonize arafat 
nathans radio station broacasts from a ship in the 
mediterranean he is known for making a private peace mission to 
egypt when the country was at war with israel in the 1960s and 
staging a 45day hunger strike in 1978 to protest the building of 
jewish settlements in the occupied lands

a state law that allows men to go 
barechested in public but forbids women from doing the same is 
unconstitutional contends a group of women fighting for topfree 
equality 
ten women arrested june 24 for doffing their tops at a beach on 
lake ontario argued tuesday in court that a statute prohibiting 
them from baring their breats is discriminatory 
city court judge john manning regan will resume hearing 
testimony in the case today 
the statute denies the women their constitutionally guaranteed 
right to equal protection under the law said attorney sharon kelly 
sayers who represents eight of the women 
this statute is a tool for police officers to harass and 
intimidate women she said its a discriminatory law 
assistant district attorney ann chase said she does not plan to 
address the constitutional issue 
the women were charged under new yorks exposure of person 
statute for refusing to put shirts on when monroe county sheriffs 
deputies asked them to 
they are here only because they are women doing simple 
everyday things that men are allowed to do everyday said jeffrey 
wicks attorney for defendant nina leibowitz 
topfree equality picnics have been held since 1986 when several 
of the same women were arrested for going topless those charges 
were dismissed when a judge ruled that the topless picnic had been 
an expression of free speech 
women are allowed to expose their breasts while entertaining or 
breastfeeding said group organizer mary lou schloss who 
represented herself at the trial 
those exemptions result in a patriarchal situation where a 
woman is allowed to expose her breasts to feed a baby or to dance 
provocatively to sexually arouse men but may not for her own 
comfort swim or sun topfree she said 
state law barred men from baring their chests until 1942 
schloss said when their protests provoked a change in the statute 
women must be allowed the same right that men have had for 50 
years in new york state the right to enjoy the sun air and water 
topless she said

buckshot injuries he said 
nine inmates were taken to chester memorial hospital four with 
gunshot wounds four with stab wounds and one with contusions to

hundreds of shells pelted a khmer rouge 
refugee camp near the cambodian border today forcing thousands of 
refugees to flee or take cover a relief official said 
the official who asked not to be named said more than 1000 
refugees fled the site 8 refugee camp into the mountains deeper 
inside thai territory as the barrage was fired from inside cambodia 
the shells were believed fired by cambodian government troops 
reacting to khmer rouge operations in the area 
the bunkers are full the culverts are full nobody is out on 
the road the official said of the camp which houses 41000 
refugees for safety reasons the un border relief organization 
placed the camp offlimits to aid workers 
fighting along the thaicambodian border has intensified in 
recent weeks as vietnam announced a total pullout of its forces 
that were backing the vietnaminstalled government vietnam says 
the pullout was completed on tuesday 
the khmer rouge are loosely allied to two noncommunist 
guerrilla groups that have been fighting the phnom penh government 
and the vietnamese who invaded cambodia in late 1978 and toppled a 
khmer rouge government 
the khmer rouge were in power in cambodia in 19751978 during 
that time hundreds of thousands of cambodias 8 million people 
died from khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest 
the khmer rouge radio said its guerrillas have begun a new 
offensive on the gemtrading center of pailin in western cambodia 
and were shelling the town from all sides 
the guerrilla radio the voice of the national army of 
democratic kampuchea has recently claimed a series of battle 
successes in the region around pailin the town is northwest of 
phnom penh close to the thai frontier 
the latest claim came late tuesday as vietnamese troops were 
completing what they said was their final withdrawal 
a text of the broadcast was received today in bangkok 
it said the guerrillas had reorganized into three attack forces 
after smashing the small medium and large positions of the 
vietnamese enemies and their puppets protecting pailin from the 
north and west 
the radio charged that despite vietnams assurances that all its 
troops have left cambodia hanoi had sent 3000 troops to help 
defend pailin 
it was not possible to verify this claim however many western 
analysts doubt that the vietnamese would have left behind such a 
large force 
gen pat akkanibut of thailands supreme military command told 
the associated press that there were suspicions about a residual 
vietnamese military presence in cambodia but that it was too early 
to make an assessment 
let this game withdrawal finish and then we will watch he 
said adding that it was vital for all parties that an 
international monitoring mechanism be set up to determine whether 
vietnam had kept its pledge 
thailand supports the guerrillas and allows weapons from china 
to pass through its territory to their border bases 
in trang lon tay vietnam officers from a withdrawing 
vietnamese army division said today that they believe the cambodian 
government forces could quickly defeat the khmer rouge if thailand 
stops giving them shelter 
if the thai government stops its support of the guerrillas 
the cambodian government will have no problem ending the 
insurgency said bui buc tran deputy commander of the 5th 
division we are completely satisfied that the cambodian people 
now have the full ability to defend themselves 
pat indicated that thailands backing would continue until 
vietnams withdrawal could be proved and external military aid from 
all sides was halted the soviet union is the major weapons 
supplier for the phnom penh side

relentless as a professional criminal than mr manna said

that led to 100year prison terms for the mafia top bosses in 
the face of this awesome criminality you almost lose the capacity

it is too early to tell whether a treaty that 
would halve us and soviet longrange nuclear arsenals will be 
ready for a superpower summit next year moscows chief envoy to 
the arms talks said today 
on the eve of a new round of negotiations yuri nazarkin said 
that after last weeks concessions by the soviet union the most 
difficult remaining issue involves airlaunched cruise missiles 
he said he will await us reaction to the soviet moves which 
include a proposal on the missiles before assessing chances for 
completing a draft strategic arms reduction treaty 
i wouldnt dare to forecast the prospect of the negotiations 
from the point of view of the forthcoming summit nazarkin said 
at a news conference we still expect the american reaction here 
in geneva 
but an accord between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev for a summit in the first half of 1990 
reflects the confidence of the sides that major agreement and 
substantial progress are possible nazarkin said in a prepared 
statement 
he said the outstanding points on the airlaunched cruise 
missiles include their allowed range and how to deal with bombers 
carrying cruise missiles tipped with conventional rather than 
nuclear warheads 
his remarks were similar to others by senior officials on both 
sides who have said an agreement is within reach but that remaining 
obstacles should not be underestimated 
talks began in march 1985 on a treaty aimed at reducing us and 
soviet longrange nuclear forces by 30 percent to 50 percent both 
sides have already agreed to ceilings of 6000 nuclear warheads and 
1600 delivery vehicles missiles and bombers with which each 
superpower can strike the other directly 
the talks are to resume thursday when delegation officials 
discuss how the session will be organized nazarkin and us chief 
envoy richard burt are to meet friday and the first full meeting 
of both delegations is set for monday 
us secretary of state james baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze met in wyoming over the weekend and 
moscow removed a longstanding obstacle in the talks by announcing 
it would not let its objections to us plans for spacebased 
missile defenses block the signing of a treaty 
under the new soviet position us tests involving the 
strategic defense initiative connected with research would be 
permitted but not trials of systems or prototypes nazarkin 
said 
the soviets also agreed to a us demand for not including 
seabased cruise missiles under the weapons ceilings of a treaty 
washington says the rockets cannot be monitored reliably 
the two sides also agreed on certain anticheating measures for 
the proposed treaty 
earlier the bush administration said it would drop its demand 
for a ban on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles provided 
congress approves funding for such missiles the soviets have them 
but the united states does not

salman rushdie is not the only author vilified 
for writing about topics that upset moslems the pen international 
writers association says 
there is a new threat to freedom of expression alexander 
blokh pens international secretary said tuesday 
iranian radical moslem clerics offered a multimillion dollar 
bounty for the death of rushdie whose book the satanic verses 
was thought by many moslems to be blasphemous 
while protesting the campaign waged against rushdie blokh said 
his group became aware of other writers living abroad who face 
pressures intimidation sometimes direct threats because of 
their work 
pen the international association of poets playwrights 
editors and novelists is holding its world congress this week in 
toronto and montreal it recommended that its member chapters 
invite writers in the islamic community to discuss such situations 
their causes and the means to find a solution 
we would ask them to come and very discreetly tell us their 
story if they want to blokh said at a news conference that 
concluded the toronto portion of the conference 
they are at certain moments in a state of terror he said 
he a writer can be in a very free city and yet he lives in 
a very permanent state of terror discreet terror 
blokh who lives in paris said he also learned of a similar 
case in moscow 
im not going to tell you any concrete cases because they are 
still quite secret he said 
blokh said only the rushdie case was known to have official 
status issued by a government but other incidents of 
religious fanaticism certainly could be considered a new threat 
to freedom of expression that came as a surprise at the end of the 
20th century 
he said the new form of censorship discovered only recently was 
something for which were not prepared 
the threats were coming not from a government but from a very 
hard to define community he said 
the groups recommendation on intolerance and fanaticism as 
translated by the associated press from a french copy said the 
rushdie incident is not isolated and revealed many other 
pressures happily less grave but equally as unacceptable for 
freedom of expression 
it said the pressures might be exercised through diplomatic 
family community religious or terrorist routes by governmental 
authorities or others in the name of islam 
blokh said the association wanted to be careful not to appear 
racist in discussing the situation but wants its members to study 
together our possible reaction and how we should face this new 
threat to freedom of expression 
the association also recommended increased contacts between 
writers from western and eastern european countries with a first 
session planned next year in vienna austria to work toward 
exchanging information that may have been missed during the past 40 
years of limited contacts 
a new russian soviet chapter based in moscow is attending the 
conference for the first time pen had kept out the soviet union 
for 65 years because of its persecution of writers and other 
intellectuals and moscow had regarded the authors group as 
anticommunist

the communist party has rebuked two government 
ministers for failing to produce and deliver basic consumer goods 
including soap clothing and shoes the newspaper pravda said today 
the report said that 88 percent of basic consumer goods were 
generally not available mainly because of ministerial 
mismanagement 
out of 276 basic consumer goods 243 cannot be found in shops 
including soap toothpaste razor blades notebooks pencils 
clothing and shoes pravda said 
checks show that a number of ministers are still using old 
approaches to planning and financing production of consumer 
goods it said 
the chronic shortage of consumer goods which has worsened over 
the past several years despite the economic restructuring initiated 
by president mikhail s gorbachev has top billing during the 
current session of the supreme soviet legislature 
in an effort to stem the shortages the central committee 
ordered the party control committee to find out which party members 
in the council of ministers were responsible pravda said 
the committee considered the issue of the issue of party 
responsibility of a number of communists heads of standing 
committees of the council of ministers ministries and departments 
who are guilty of frustrating the production of consumer goods and 
unsatisfactory supplies of these goods to the population pravda 
said 
reprimanded as a result of the investigation were vladimir 
gusev the minister responsible for chemical and timber industries 
and v lakhtin who is in charge of social development pravda said 
gusev was reprimanded for committing errors failing to take 
necessary measures for providing basic consumer goods the report 
said and lakhtin was reprimanded for failing to take measures to 
increase deliveries of basic consumer goods 
several lowerranking ministers also were reprimanded for their 
failure to get goods to the market in response to consumer demands 
pravda said 
an official reprimand which goes into a party members 
permanent file is considered a serious punishment and weighs 
heavily in any decision regarding the members future in the party

cowardly terrorist act 
a senior philippine official said president corazon aquino had 
accepted the us offer to begin talks in december on whether to 
extend the leases on six military bases the leases expire in 
september 1991 
police fired tear gas to disperse 2000 leftists near the 
presidential palace who refused to end an antibases rally

the capital in response us officials banned nonessential 
travel between bases by the 40000 american troops civilian 
employees and military dependents in the philippines 
quayle called the killings cowardly murders that would 
only serve to strengthen us support for mrs aquino 
later he told us troops and their families that he was 
convinced a majority of the people in the philippines want us to 
stay let me be direct terrorists will not drive americans from 
the philippines 
the attack occurred shortly before quayle arrived to discuss 
extending the leases of the six us military installations among 
the largest such bases outside the continental united states

said he delivered a letter from president bush suggesting talks 
begin in december on the future of clark air base the subic bay

will be making an appropriate response i had a very positive 
impression from mrs aquino regarding the relationship between the 
united states and the philippines 
there was no formal announcement from the philippines on whether 
mrs aquino agreed to the proposal but presidential executive 
secretary catalino macaraig told the associated press bushs offer 
was accepted and that written confirmation would be handed to 
quayle before he leaves thursday for malaysia 
asked why no announcement had been made macaraig replied 
when youre being courted you have to be coy 
opposition to the bases is mounting in the philippines mrs 
aquino who is to visit washington in november has offered new 
talks on the issue but refuses to say whether she will support an 
extension 
a filipino official speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
did not want to discuss the bases in detail during her washington 
visit 
quayle told reporters i hope that the people of the 
philippines understand and appreciate not only the special 
relationship the sense of stability that the facilities offer 
stability in the political sense stability in the economic sense 
stability in the sense of hopefully seeing expanded economic 
opportunities and development to the people of the philippines

to the main gate they held a rally about a half mile from the 
gate where speakers called for the bases to be closed 
any new agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate where opposition to the installations 
is strong 
during a courtesy call on senate president jovito salonga

more than 230 people arrived in southern 
japan today in a 50ton wooden boat many of them believed to be 
chinese seeking jobs not asylum in asias wealthiest nation 
the boat people were the first to land in japan since an 
unprecedented influx forced the government two weeks ago to tighten 
its policy on who will be accepted as refugees officials said 
the new arrivals who appeared tired but healthy were the fifth 
group to be brought ashore in okinawa japans southernmost 
prefecture since august said kazuyoh sameshima a spokesman in 
naha for the maritime safety agency japans coast guard it was 
the largest group of refugees this year 
sameshima said 231 people were crowded aboard the boat which a 
coast guard ship escorted into port at naha okinawas capital 
1000 miles from tokyo 
though most were young men about 12 children were aboard 
sameshima said young mothers could be seen cradling babies as 
immigration officials began herding them on to buses most refused 
to answer reporters questions 
sameshima refused to comment on whether they were vietnamese 
but he said the boat originally had departed from vietnam and 
stopped in china because of typhoon damage a new boat brought the 
group from china to japan 
a vietnamese interpreter who requested anonymity said that 
although some of the passengers spoke vietnamese most appeared to 
be chinese 
after being checked by immigration officials the arrivals were 
taken to a nearby university where they were to spend the night on 
a gymnasium floor officials said they would be transferred soon to 
an immigration center that is already filled to three times its 
normal capacity 
so far this year 2950 vietnamese boat people have arrived in 
japan compared with 219 in all of 1988 
on sept 13 japan began a policy of screening boat people 
accepting those deemed to be fleeing political persecution but 
refusing permission for economic migrants to stay 
todays arrivals were the first since then said an official at 
the refugee division of the justice ministry in tokyo 
he said if immigration authorities determine indochinese among 
the boat people had fled their homeland for economic reasons they 
would be detained until accepted back in their home country or in a 
third country 
if they are not indochinese they are not eligible for refugee 
status and will be repatriated the foreign ministry has said

seven white policemen demanding a level 
playing field are suing over a 1979 courtordered affirmative 
plan that they say unfairly promoted lessqualified minorities 
ahead of them 
it could be the first test of a recent us supreme court ruling 
that gives municipal employees the right to challenge 
courtapproved preferential employment practices 
the suit filed monday in superior court claims the seven 
officers are the victim of racial quotas it maintains that the 
city has violated a state civil rights law against the use of race 
or sex in hiring and promotion 
robert gyemant the attorney for the officers said his clients 
should not be forced to pay the price to right wrongs carried out 
before any of them were involved with the department 
all we are saying is why make our clients pay for it he 
said 
he said his clients only want a level playing field 
the suit seeks back pay punitive damages and an end to the 
alleged discrimination the amount of damages sought was not 
disclosed 
earlier this year the us supreme court decided that white 
firefighters hired in birmingham ala after a consent decree was 
approved could fight the preferential promotion of allegedly less 
qualified black firefighters

the countrys deeply split 
communist leadership today asked slovenias legislature to postpone 
a vote on constitutional changes that would spell out the 
republics right to secede 
but miran potrc president of slovenias parliament said 
slovenians are determined to go ahead with the amendments and 
media reports said lawmakers would almost certainly approve the 
package 
the slovenian parliament is the only legal institution that 
can decide on such crucial matters potrc said during a 
legislative session today in the regional capital ljubljana 
besides declaring slovenias right to secede the changes place 
strict controls on the use of army units in the republic and 
restrict imposition of martial law there by yugoslavias collective 
eightmember presidency 
but after a 17hour debate that lasted into today the countrys 
policysetting communist party central committee voted 9740 to 
call on slovenian communists to postpone the adoption of the 
amendments in question 
delegates to the hurriedly convened belgrade session said 
passage of the amendments might lead to military intervention in 
slovenia the richest and most westernoriented of yugoslavias six 
republics 
and there were sharp exchanges between delegates from slovenia 
and serbia home to the national capital belgrade 
serbia the largest of the republics advocates transforming 
yugoslavia from a loose federation to a more unified nation by 
limiting regional rights serbian delegates said that the changes 
would open the way to eventual dissolution of the yugoslav 
federation 
the slovenian leadership said tuesday however that the 
amendments in no way contradict the federal constitution 
we are convinced that the changes will only serve to 
strengthen and not to threaten the concept of yugoslavia as a 
free democratic and equitable community of peoples potrc said 
as he spoke 2000 workers of a construction company in 
titograd capital of the southern republic of montenegro went into 
the streets today to protest the impending adoption of the 
controversial amendments the official tanjug news agency 
reported 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure serbia 
is the largest republic and kosovo and vojvodina provinces are part 
of it but not fully subject to its control 
the decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in 1974 to prevent one republic from 
gaining sway over the others but it has resulted in an ineffective 
government by compromise 
milan kucan head of the slovenian communist party said the 
central committee debate on the issue amounted to a restriction 
of the sovereign will of the slovenian people 
slovenian communists will choose to defend the interests of 
the slovenian people rather than becoming quislings kucan said 
ivo druzic a central committee member from croatia warned that 
should the military intervene to prevent the changes this would 
mean the compromising of the army command which would be seen as 
suspending the constitution instead of defending it 
but a military representative adm petar simic said the 
yugoslav army was not a mercenary army that would allow anyone 
to use it as they see fit 
janez kocijancic a slovenian businessman referring to the june 
military crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in china asked 
whether anyone wishes to expand tiananmen square to the gates of 
trieste an italian city on the yugoslav border 
slovenia is the countrys smallest but most economically 
developed republic accounting for more than 20 percent of the 
national product and 30 percent of hard currency exports 
its population however represents just eight percent of the 
countrys total 
belgrade radio reported that janez drnovsek a slovene who 
currently heads yugoslavias collective presidency cut short his 
visit to the united nations and was expected back in slovenia today

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
today the senates refusal to put an additional 300 million into 
star wars reflects a growing sentiment toward reining in the 
missiledefense shield 
i think there is a growing recognition that we have to 
reduce our expectations and level of resources committed to it 
mitchell dmaine told reporters he said the senate vote was a 
strong indication of concern in that regard 
by a vote of 6634 tuesday the senate turned aside a 
republicanbacked attempt to restore funds to star wars formally 
known as the strategic defense initiative to a level closer to the 
45 billion approved by the senate in its authorization bill last 
month 
mitchell said the vote amounted to a major blow to the program 
thenpresident reagan proposed star wars six years ago hailing it 
as a nuclearage antidote to a strike against the united states 
the funding level adopted in the 288 billion appropriations 
bill totals about 41 billion 37 billion for the pentagons 
program and 355 million in energy department and military 
construction money that amount falls 900 million short of what 
bush requested for the program in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
members of the senate armed services committee who are 
negotiating with house members on a final defense authorization 
bill said the chambers votes undermine chances that star wars 
spending will be higher than the 41 billion spent in fiscal 1989 
the house this year approved a defense blueprint that earmarks 
31 billion for star wars 
there isnt any question that sdi is extremely weak it looks 
to me now that it will be under last years level when we get out 
of conference sen james exon dneb said shortly after the 
senate action 
its continuing the downward pressure said sen tim wirth 
dcolo theres an increase in the effort to make it a research 
program where it belongs 
lawmakers said the soviet unions announcement this weekend that 
it would separate star wars from negotiations on a treaty to reduce 
strategic arms may have taken steam out of the drive to increase 
sdi spending 
sdi has now been cut loose sen john warner of virginia 
ranking republican on the armed services committee 
but some members said that since star wars was also one of 
several items in an 85 billion amendment to the spending bill 
the senate vote was not a clearcut referendum on the program 
this was not prosdi or antisdi said sen william cohen 
rmaine a member of the armed services panel they put in apache 
helicopters the space program sealift 
the amendment with the increased star wars spending introduced 
by warner and sen malcolm wallop rwyo would have also restored 
910 million for the submarinebased longrange trident 2 nuclear 
missile and reduced funds for the apache helicopter 
in other action the senate 
rejected 7129 an amendment that would have cut 27 billion 
from bushs request for 47 billion next year to buy and test the 
first 13 models of the b2 stealth bomber 
overwhelmingly endorsed a costsaving plan to shut down 86 
military bases and scale back five more the vote was 8614 
approved 6534 a nonbinding resolution calling on bush to 
report to congress before april 1 1990 on the us militarys 
presence in south korea sen dale bumpers dark had proposed a 
reduction of 3000 in the 43800 us troops stationed in the asian 
nation but the sense of congress measure prevailed 
approved the transfer of 135 million from the defense 
department to the energy department for the restart of the three 
tritium reactors at the savannah river nuclear plant 
provided 20 million in military assistance for jordan this 
amendment was introduced at the request of bush and approved by 
voice vote 
approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in the 
caribbean and united states damaged last week by hurricane hugo 
the total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available but 
sen ernest hollings dsc the plans sponsor said 50 million 
was for a navy shipyard in charleston and 25 million was for shaw

rain and illnesses worsened the 
plight of hundreds of east german refugees crowding the west german 
embassy compound but more newcomers kept scaling the fence of the 
missions garden today 
according to the refugees who talked to reporters the number of 
people thronging the compound had reached 1500 by midday 
only 177 of them were said to have left tuesday and today 
accepting an east german government offer of guaranteed emigration 
within six months if they return home 
in talks with the refugees tuesday east german emissary 
wolfgang vogel a confidant of communist leader erich honecker 
said those willing to return could emigrate without facing 
prosecution for flight from the republic and other offenses 
the emissary was evidently seeking to persuade larger numbers of 
refugees to accept the government offer but the majority 
apparently remained skeptical 
some of the refugees told reporters that the crowd inside 
contained a lot of people with a criminal record people who are 
not politically motivated to emigrate from east germany 
in an effort to accommodate the swelling crowd several hundred 
beds today were made available by the west german army 
nevertheless living conditions in the compound were getting 
ever more precarious for the refugees most of them housed in red 
cross tents 
several of the more than 250 children were said to have fallen 
ill with diarrhea and colds following heavy rain that set in during 
the night 
we are humans not animals arent we they cannot let us rot 
away here can they a man asked western reporters talking to him 
through the fence 
i dont accept the east german offer i leave here only to 
the west or in a coffin said a mother of three 
the number of east german refugees in bonns mission in warsaw 
was reported to have reached 400 
after holding inconclusive talks with his czechoslovak 
counterpart west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher 
was to confer with his east german colleague oskar fischer at the 
united nations in new york 
the east german flood to the west occurred after hungary opened 
its borders and allowed up to 20000 east germans in that country 
to flee into austria east germany and czechoslovakia are hardline 
communist bloc nations unlike hungary which is embracing liberal 
reforms and closer ties to the west

an inexpensive drug used to treat 
bronchitis appeared to block production of the aids virus in 
testtube experiments researchers said 
the researchers cautioned against human use of the drug until 
the outcome of further study 
the drug is not a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
scientists at stanford university said tuesday in announcing 
results of lab tests 
but they said it could slow down the virus assault on the 
immune system as well as prolong and improve the patients quality 
of life when used with azt or other drugs approved for treating 
aids 
unlike compound q a sometimes toxic protein distilled from a 
chinese cucumber root dextran sulfate from japan or highpriced 
azt the drug under study at stanford is readily available and 
relatively cheap and safe 
i am really optimistic about this said dr leonore 
herzenberg a professor of genetics at stanford who worked on the 
research with her husband geneticist dr leonard herzenberg 
looking at the scientific evidence for what this drug does 
and the scientific evidence for how aids works our guess is that 
treatment with this drug may be quite good but until we get it 
tested in patients we wont know if it will work 
the drug nacetylcysteine nac is used for treating chronic 
bronchitis and other lung ailments and as an antidote to overdoses 
of acetaminophen the ingredient in tylenol and other 
overthecounter pain relievers the drug is made by the zambon 
group in italy and is available in liquid form in the united states 
and in tablet form in europe bristolmyers co makes a vaporized 
formula with the drug called mucomist 
mrs herzenberg warned that aids patients should not begin 
taking the drug in any form before further experiments show whether 
the drug works on aids in humans 
were moving as quickly as possible and we are now talking 
with physicians about doing clinical tests she said 
dr mervyn silverman president of the american foundation for 
aids research said the experiments sounded promising but he also 
urged caution 
while i think this holds promise we have to have tests on 
humans before we know how effective it will be silverman said 
nac blocks the triggering of aids virus production by increasing 
glutathione levels in blood cells affected by the virus the 
herzenbergs said glutathione eliminates potentially harmful 
oxidizing agents and is essential for energy generation and other 
cell functions 
the herzenbergs are scheduled to report preliminary results of 
the research today at an international conference exploring 
research strategies on aids in geneva

senate majority leader george mitchell accused 
president bush today of being overly timid and urged him to 
suspend trade restrictions with the soviet union as a reward for 
permitting freer emigration 
mitchell called for the temporary waiver of the jacksonvanik 
amendment which links nondiscriminatory trade treatment by the 
united states with the freedom of soviet citizens to leave their 
country at will 
the democratic leader noted that more than 100000 people have 
been permitted to leave the soviet union since the beginning of the 
year and that as many as 50000 more have received permission to 
depart 
this indisputable rise in soviet emiagration is a step that 
deserves an american response mitchell told the senate the 
response quite clearly should be the conditional lifting of 
impediments to trade imposed by the jacksonvanik amendment 
the jacksonvanik amendment was adopted by congress in 1974 at 
the height of the cold war named for its principal sponsors the 
late sen henry m jackson dwash and former rep charles a 
vanik dohio the amendment bars the extension of trade credits 
and the granting of mostfavored nation trade status to communist 
nations which deny citizens the freedom to emigrate 
mitchell noted that the law permits the president to waive the 
amendment if he determines soviet citizens are no longer denied the 
right to leave or if such a waiver will promote freedom of 
emigration 
he said lifting the amendment would not automatically confer 
dramatic trade benefits that a ussoviet commercial agreement 
would be needed to do that and that trade would continue to be 
limited by a lack of demand for soviet products 
but jacksonvanik is of tremendous symbolic importance 
mitchell said noting that soviet leaders have long cited it as an 
obstacle to closer relations 
bush has said he will consider waiving the amendment only when 
the soviets formally change their emigration laws and when the 
results of that change are seen to be both visible and permament 
i believe this is an overly timid approach mitchell said 
declaring that soviet emigration levels are now three times what 
they were in 1979 the previous highwater mark 
if the president temporarily waives jacksonvanik he loses 
nothing he can only win mitchell said 
he can refuse to renew it should the soviets restrict 
emigration or refuse to codify their emigration laws and i would 
be among the first to urge him to do so the majority leader said 
waiving the law now would conform with the intent of the 
amendment provide a carrot and stick to influence the future 
of soviet emigration and demonstrate that ussoviet trade is 
primarily limited by the failure of the soviet economic system not 
by us actions he said 
it is disappointing that the president has failed to recognize 
that the goals of jacksonvanik have been met mitchell said 
president bush should accept victory and respond accordingly

investigators in the crash of a usair jet that 
skidded off a runway into the east river last week are looking into 
reports that the cockpit crew was at a bar hours before takeoff 
the new york post said today 
detectives were trying to find the hotel bartender who was 
working sept 20 before the boeing 737400 crashed at laguardia 
airport the newspaper reported citing sources it did not 
identify two passengers died in the accident 
in another development a grand jury was assembled tuesday to 
hear testimony about the crash 
prosecutors said monday that capt michael w martin and 
copilot constantine kleissas tested negative for alcohol but the 
urine samples were taken 48 hours after the accident experts said 
alcohol consumed two days earlier would probably not show up anyway 
questions about drinking were raised by eric trendal the 
husband of a usair employee who told authorities he had been out 
bouncing with the captain and the copilot he said he was with 
them at a bar in the marriott hotel between 730 pm and 930 pm 
wednesday the flight crashed at 1129 pm 
investigators want to find out what trendal means by 
bouncing they said they believe it means drinking or bar 
hopping the post said 
a detective close to the investigation told the post it is 
believed the crew spent as many as five hours of their sixhour 
layover in bars near the airport 
frederick hafetz an attorney for the pilots refused to comment 
on the grand jury investigation begun by the queens district 
attorneys office 
the national transportation safety board conducting its own 
probe reported tuesday tha investigators found that almost all of 
the tread on the jets front tires was gone 
that was consistent with the pilots statements that he had 
tried to halt the jet before it hit the water said ntsb spokesman

the cbs evening news aired fake combat 
footage and false news reports of the war in afghanistan in the 
mid1980s the new york post reported today cbs declined immediate 
comment 
howard stringer a top cbs corporate official who formerly was 
executive producer of the program said he would look into the 
matter 
most of the questioned footage was shot by mike hoover 45 a 
freelance cameraman who the post said staged scenes of guerrilla 
sabotage and made a chinesemade pakistani jet fighter on a 
training run appear to be a soviet plane bombing afghan villages 
im going to have to look into it said stringer now 
president of the cbs broadcast group and the programs executive 
producer from 1981 until january 1984 before the suspect footage 
was aired 
stringer himself a former documentary maker for cbs news 
declined comment on the post story saying he hadnt yet read it 
and that its assertions are all news to me 
i dont know who the people involved are or who the 
accusations are coming from he said in a telephone interview 
from washington 
we cant respond to the story until we talk to the freelance 
cameraman involved said a cbs news spokesman tom goodman 
cbs anchorman dan rather had no immediate comment a spokeswoman 
said 
rather also anchored a 1987 cbs reports documentary the 
battle for afghanistan that used footage shot by hoover that 
previously had aired on the cbs evening news 
cbs at the time said the programs footage represented 18 trips 
into afghanistan by hoover and his crews over a threeyear period 
the program included some of the footage whose authenticity was 
questioned in the post story 
a woman who identified herself as beverly johnson and said she 
was hoovers wife said he was working in remote caves in new 
zealand and could not be contacted according to the post 
in a los angeles times interview in 1987 hoover explained that 
he would propose coverage of the fighting in afghanistan on a 
storybystory basis to cbs which then would either approve or 
reject each proposal 
cbs never turned him down he said crediting rather as really 
the muscle behind his cbs assignments to cover the war 
in the same interview hoover said that he had gone to vietnam 
in 1968 on assignment for nbc he also said he didnt consider 
himself a news cameraman in the traditional sense im really 
kind of a film maker he said 
during news broadcasts on nov 12 and 13 1984 rather said 
hoover had been on hand for the largest sabotage operation of the 
war videotape shot by hoover showed mujahedeen rebels 
purportedly blowing up pylons to cut power to the afghan capital of 
kabul 
the actual sabotage however took place 12 days before hoover 
arrived on the scene the post said etabari an afghan serving as 
the cameramans translator told the newspaper hoover persuaded 
guerrilla leaders to order about a dozen rebels to return to the 
site so he could stage the sabotage 
he told the mujahedeen to destroy pylons that were already 
destroyed it was completely wrong it was just for the movie 
the post quoted etabari as saying 
an afghanbritish journalist habib kawyani confirmed hoover 
arrived in the pakistani border town of peshawar too late to shoot 
the actual sabotage the post said 
in a pakistani military training camp hoover staged rebels 
stalking alleged government guards and blowing up a mine etabari 
also said some footage of 4000 afghanis shown purportedly fleeing 
their homes near kabul actually was shot near the afghanpakistani 
border etabari said 
the network won the du pont silver baton award for the news 
segments the post said 
the newspaper said cbs in 1987 also bought footage stolen from 
mohamed salam an afghan journalism student under boston university 
dean joachim maitre rather reported the tape was shot by hoover 
and depicted the biggest oneday defeat of soviet forces since 
world war ii 
the tape actually showed afghan government troops under attack 
according to the post there were no soviets there said maitre 
maitre said he sought and received an apology from cbs 
according to the newspaper his office said today he was at 
conference in washington and was unavailable for comment

abortion foes demonstrated at the home of a city 
solicitor who called the protest an intimidation ploy that would 
not stop him from prosecuting operation rescues leader on 
trespassing charges 
about 15 people gathered tuesday night outside the home of chief 
assistant solicitor general robert lee obrien jr police reported 
no arrests 
people need to know hes protecting child killers said one 
demonstrator archie bradley of delaware 
randall terrys trial resumed as scheduled this morning and the 
prosecutor was back in court as expected 
this is obviously a definite attempt to influence the way i 
handle the case and its not going to happen obrien said 
tuesday it kind of makes me a little angry that they would come 
to my private residence and do this type of thing 
i will not let it interfere with my job he said its not 
appropriate for them to try to intimidate a prosecutor whos trying 
to do his job 
tuesday nights demonstration followed the start of terrys 
trial which stems from protests outside abortion clinics during 
the 1988 democratic national convention 
obrien objected in court when terry told jurors that the 
demonstrations were held last year to save children from abortion 
judge john bruner ruled that terry could not use justification 
as a defense in his trial on criminal trespass and unlawful 
assembly charges 
terry who is representing himself is among about 60 
antiabortion demonstrators scheduled for trial only a few are 
expected to be tried in the next few weeks 
if convicted terry could be sentenced to a one year in jail and 
fined 1000 on each misdemeanor charge 
terry told jurors that while prosecutors made it seem like 
this is a fairly open and shut case i mean to show you we 
had no intention to break the law our only intention was to save 
children from abortion 
obrien objected saying abortion was not the issue with the 
jury absent he said justification is a proper defense only when a 
person believes he must use force or threat to defend himself 
against the use of force by another 
hes trying to present his view that abortion is not right 
but in this state abortion is legal the prosecutor said 
terry countered im not talking about a justification defense 
but what was in my mind 
operation rescue based in binghamton ny organized 
antiabortion demonstrations around the country 
more than 1200 arrests were made at about 20 protests at 
atlantaarea abortion clinics during the summer and fall of 1988

archbishop of grahamstown along with other local clerics and human 
rights lawyers 
the rally clogged the entire downtown area and most shops closed 
for the day marchers danced chanted and sang freedom songs and 
some carried the green gold and black flag of the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement 
leaders of the rally marched to the headquarters of the security 
police and presented written demands that call for the release of 
political prisoners the legalization of banned opposition groups 
and the lifting of the 3yearold state of emergency 
there was a heavy police presence at the rally including 
armored vehicles and a helicopter but officers stood aside and no 
incidents were reported 
all the approved mass rallies in the past two weeks have been 
peaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in the 
southeastern city of pietermaritzburg in pretoria police used 
clubs saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with a 
protest march that was not authorized 
in johannesburg white students at rand afrikaans university 
jeered and heckled about 200 black students who marched today to 
protest the segregated dormitories about 75 percent of the 
students at the overwhelmingly white university voted last week to 
maintain segregated residences the black students said 
in another development authorities released a prominent 
antiapartheid activist who went on a hunger strike after being 
detained without charge last month his attorney said 
trevor manuel who was freed tuesday is one of the topranking 
leaders in cape town of the banned united democratic front the 
countrys largest antiapartheid coalition 
manuel who has been detained previously was held in the 
central city of bloemfontein and refused to eat for two weeks of 
his 30day confinement attorney essa moosa said 
before his most recent detention manuel was under police 
restrictions that limited his movements moosa said he did not know 
if any new restrictions had been placed on his client 
many activists have ignored the police orders as part of the 
nationwide defiance campaign 
the government released hundreds of detainees earlier this year 
after they launched a hunger strike and only a few dozen were 
being held without charge in june and july 
however a human rights groups estimate that the number has 
risen to about 250 more than 30000 people have been detained 
without charge for varying lengths of time under the 3yearold 
state of emergency 
in johannesburg meanwhile the city formally opened all public 
facilities to blacks today after the city council voted to 
desegregate buses swimming pools and recreation centers

handicapped people who occupied a federal 
building for two days in a bid to get wheelchair lifts installed on 
public buses ended the protest after winning a pledge of support 
from the bush administration 
the group the american disabled for accessible public 
transportation failed to achieve their main demand tuesday a 
federal order requiring such lifts 
but federal officials promised to urge transportation secretary 
samuel skinner to meet with them 
this agreement by no means resolves the problem of access it 
just brings us a step closer said mark johnson one of the 
protest leaders who met with steven diaz chief counsel for the 
urban mass transportation administration 
the protest at the richard b russell federal building began 
monday with two dozen protesters chaining themselves to the main 
doors and blocking elevators with wheelchairs the action coincided 
with skinners appearance at the convention of the american public 
transportation association 
authorities tried to eject the protesters monday night but 
president bush intervened and let about 100 spend the night inside 
rather than send them out into the rain 
on tuesday about 160 chanting singing activists blocked 12 of 
14 elevators security officers kept two elevators open by using 
plant stands to keep wheelchairs away 
diaz told protest leaders that the transportation department 
cannot issue a summary order commanding immediate access 
including wheelchair access for all transit we would if we could 
under an agreement between federal officials and the protesters 
skinner will be urged to meet promptly with disabled activists to 
ensure a principle of accessibility until congress passes a law 
requiring wheelchair lifts 
in addition the protesters may continue a symbolic presence 
at the building 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said wheelchair lifts on 
public buses would be required under a bill bush has endorsed 
government officials have estimated that putting lifts on new buses 
would cost 90 million a year

water began flowing to the homes of 
thousands of san juan residents today for the first time since 
hurricane hugo slammed into the island nine days ago 
officials had expressed concern that the prolonged shortage was 
posing a serious health hazard 
the water and sewer authority said 90 percent of the homes in 
the city of san juan where onethird of puerto ricos 33 million 
people live were receiving running water today spokeswoman 
lilliana rivera said most of the rest of the island also had water 
in a school shelter in the town of yabucoa in eastern puerto 
rico health officials said a monthold girl died sunday of 
salmonella at first it was believed the baby had died of 
meningitis and 40 hurricane victims housed in the same school were 
given antibiotics to ward off the contagious illness 
health officials were concerned disease might spread from 
insects and rats feeding on the piles of garbage which contain 
rotting meats vegetables and fruits that spoiled from lack of 
refrigeration in the hurricane aftermath 
worst hit was the san juan metropolitan area home to more than 
half of the islands population twothirds were without water 
after five motors at the carraizo dam were damaged by hugos 140 
mph winds 
health officials concerned about the spread of disease 
launched a campaign giving residents tips on how to survive the 
shortage radio and television broadcasts periodically remind 
people to boil their drinking water 
the major problem is the lack of water said patricia 
perdue a nurse with the red cross that and the fact that trash 
is not being picked up and people cant maintain proper hygiene 
she said the red cross and other health agencies were launching 
a hygiene educational campaign at 120 shelters housing 
thousands of hurricane victims 
to bathe people have dipped into swimming pools dived into the 
ocean and kneeled beside fire hydrants they have caught rain water 
in buckets or stood for hours behind national guard and water tank 
trucks to fill plastic containers 
two us navy destroyers distributed 20000 gallons of fresh 
water 
at the ritzy el san juan hotel and condado plaza hotel amp casino 
owners brought in five 10000 gallon water trucks 
when you dont have water you cant wash your hands which is 
the best way to prevent disease so just from there the system 
breaks up said jim maze a nurse with the red cross disasters 
health service 
the water shortage provoked many complaints about the bathroom 
facilities at the luiz munoz marin international airport 
they are so filthy maintenance personnel must make a special 
effort to get near enough to clean them read an editorial

president bush told the 152nation 
international monetary fund today we must do more to help the 
new noncommunistled government of poland citing our 
selfevident stake in its success 
the president urged the international lending organization and 
its sister agency the world bank to work rapidly with poland 
to help the nation restructure its economy 
the bush administration is supporting a 119 million package of 
us economic aid to poland and another 100 million in food aid 
congressional critics are calling for more 
bush told reporters after his speech it is still too early to 
tell how much additional aid the united states might be willing to 
give to poland 
i think the key thing now is that the poles themselves are 
working on a reform package bush said we want to work with 
them in every way we can but i think its important to see what 
their plan is for economic reform 
asked about an appeal by poland for a 1 billion loan from 
industrial nations bush said the 12member european community is 
working on their side weve been helpful on ours so well see 
what final figures are arrived at 
well do everything we can we are committed to the success 
for democracy in poland he said speaking to a group of 
reporters in the oval office 
in his speech bush also vowed that the united states would work 
with the imf to help develop a compromise by the end of this year 
to help increase the organizations funds 
in his maiden speech to two multinational financial 
organizations bush also called on commercial banks to carry more 
of a burden in easing the troubled economies of latin america and 
other developing nations 
we encourage these steps not as selfsacrifice but as 
selfinterest bush said in prepared remarks success not only 
will help the debtor nations but it will also strengthen the 
banks by putting their portfolios on a sounder footing 
bushs comments to the annual imfworld bank meeting were a 
toneddown rendition of an appeal he made to a group international 
bankers and financial officials tuesday night at the white house 
at that session bush lobbied hard for the third world debt 
relief proposal crafted by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
saying bankers must accept some losses on third world loans as part 
of a new realism 
the socalled brady plan unveiled last march endorses 
voluntary efforts on the part of commercial banks to forgive part 
of the 400 billion they are owed by the largest debtor countries 
many of them in latin america 
however banks have been reluctant to endorse the plan because 
it requires them to partially forgive old loans then turn around 
and make new ones 
in todays speech to the gathering of most of the worlds 
finance ministers bush said there may be no greater opportunity 
before us all today than the challenges of poland and more 
broadly eastern europe 
bush urged the lending organizations to give special attention 
to funneling western financial aid to poland noting the united 
states and some other western nations had individually already come 
up with aid packages 
in light of clearly growing needs the recent accession of a 
solidarityled government and our selfevident stake in its 
success we must do more bush said 
for its part the united states intends to be out in front of 
this effort to take advantage of this historic development and to 
ensure its success bush said 
he called recent movement toward new freedoms and toward 
openmarket economies both in eastern europe and in the soviet 
union stunning 
the jury is no longer out look at the two economic systems 
and see who has prospered and who has struggled lets put an end 
to the economic experiment because history has decided he said 
bush told the financial officials a more open and humane 
soviet union can only be in the interest of the west 
and as we see the evidence of that reform we can match it 
with steps of our own he added 
shortly before bush spoke japanese finance minister ryutaro 
hashimoto said his government is offering poland lower tariffs on 
its exports to japan in an effort to help the reform of polands 
economy we see reform in poland as a major historical challenge 
for all of us he told reporters 
the president also appealed to the financial officials 
representing rich and poor nations alike to join forces in the war 
on drugs calling it a worldwide problem that can only be 
solved by joint international action 
to conceal their obscene profits drug barons must wash their 
money by cycling it through financial institutions and illegitimate 
shell corporations bush said 
we need tough measures to track down and confiscate the 
profits of drugrelated crime bush said he reiterated the us 
call for all countries to ratify the united nations vienna 
convention which makes money laundering a criminal and 
extraditable offense 
bush also applauded what he said was an increased attention 
being given by the world bank to the environmental consequences of 
some of its projects in developing nations but there is more to 
be done he said 
bush said the nations of the world should work more 
cooperatively to deal with the problems of global warming

the daily oklahoman oklahoma city on chemical weapons 
chemical weapons as president bush told the united nations 
are a scourge that threatens all mankind and the threat is growing 
rather than diminishing 
perhaps the most sobering statement bush made in calling for an 
international ban on these terrible weapons is that more than 20 
nations now produce them or have the ability to do so 
for a worldwide treaty to be enforceable it will require not 
only the cooperation of major countries but also some kind of 
mechanism to monitor and eliminate the use of chemical weapons by 
thugs like moammar gadhafi 
bushs goal is highly noble but one that will be extremely 
difficult to achieve

the state columbia sc on hurricane hugo 
the destruction wrought by hurricane hugo was described by 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr as unprecedented in anyones 
living memory it will take time hard work and hundreds of 
millions of dollars before south carolina especially its coastal 
areas can recover from the huge storm which landed a direct hit 
on the historic port city and nearby barrier islands 
gov carroll campbell mayor riley state health officials 
emergency preparedness personnel and thousands of national guard 
troops and law enforcement officers deserve major credit for 
minimizing the human toll from the hurricane 
tragically at least 17 lives were lost in south carolina but 
that figure might have been much higher had it not been for the 
excellent emergency planning that began long before hugo made 
landfall 
even with federal aid the blow to this states economy will be 
heavy scores of historic buildings and homes were leveled in the 
300yearold city of charleston and its barrier islands were in 
ruins many grand strand homes were swept away amusement parks 
were wiped out bridges and roads were damaged or destroyed 
at least for a while the tourist trade which brings in several 
billion dollars annually is likely to fall on hard times 
today south carolinians mourn those who did not make it through 
the storm and give thanks for those who did it was bad very bad 
but it could have been worse

assessing fully the ravages of hurricane hugo may take weeks

countless families lost homes businesses all of their 
possessions and their livelihoods battering 20foot waves and 
140mph winds devastated the isle of palms and sullivans island 
and destroyed the only bridge connecting them to the south 
carolina mainland 
homes and other structures were smashed along a corridor of 
destruction many miles wide and hundreds of miles long 
the storms worsthit victims need help and need it badly 
the need will continue until the emergency has ended and it is 
impossible at present to predict with any certainty when that will 
be either on the islands ravaged before the hurricane swept onto 
the mainland or along the arc of destruction it left as it roared 
northward 
the mayor of charleston joseph p riley after touring his 
city said we have on our hands a degree of physical destruction 
that is unprecedented in anyones living memory 
but he also promised we will not just rebuild we will 
restore 
if so the famous beauty that was charleston will not be forever 
gone with the wind 
that is the spirit it will take to recover from a stunning

portland maine press herald on flag burning 
president bush was silly to propose in response to a supreme 
court decision in june a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag 
burning and congressional democrats are cowardly in pushing 
legislation to accomplish the same end 
it would be tragic indeed if the legacy of gregory l johnson 
who triggered the case by burning the flag in a repulsive and 
childish protest were to be the undermining of our bill of rights 
there are strong indications the american people understand 
that after initial public outrage over the decision common sense 
has replaced passion 
upon calm reflection the public has increasingly accepted the 
notion that the glory of our freedoms as symbolized by the flag 
is that it protects even those who would hold it in contempt

argus leader sioux falls sd on barney frank 
when ronald reagan was president us rep barney frank was 
among those who called for attorney general edwin meese to resign 
frank has been an advocate for high ethical standards during his 
nine years in congress 
now influential voices are beginning to call for him to resign 
so far he has refused to quit 
the massachusetts democrat probably should step down if for no 
other reason than his effectiveness has diminished 
frank ought to be judged on the propriety or impropriety of what 
he did not for being a homosexual frank acknowledged publicly in 
1987 that he was gay 
he is presently under fire for involvement with a male 
prostitute who claims to have run a bisexual prostitution ring out 
of the congressmans apartment in washington dc 
frank does not deny that he had a relationship with stephen 
gobie 
in public life frank has condemned people such as meese and 
illinois rep gus savage who is accused of sexually harassing a 
peace corps worker then in private frank associates with people 
like gobie who operate at best on the fringes of the law 
franks sexual preference is not the issue the issue is

the government and colombias most 
notorious leftist guerrilla group have signed a peace accord but 
there will be no peace for the nations cocaine cartels president 
virgilio barco said 
barco was to travel to the united states today to talk with 
president bush about colombias war against the drug traffickers 
he announced the treaty late tuesday night in a surprise 
nationwide television and radio address and said it calls for 
pardons for members of the may 10 guerrilla movement and for them 
to give up their weapons the rebels also would be allowed to form 
a political party under the agreement reached after six months of 
negotiations barco said 
a deadline for the guerrillas to turn in their weapons will 
presumably be set when the congress approves an amnesty colombias 
slow moving congress probably will not decide on that until at 
least december 
there was no immediate comment from m19 one of six rebel 
groups in colombia the colombian congress must approve the accord 
the guerrillas are urging the government to end its war against 
the cocaine cartels to pardon drug traffickers and to refuse to 
extradite them to the united states 
a statement by m19 published in a fullpage advertisement 
tuesday in el tiempo colombias largest newspaper also urged 
immediate negotiations between the government and drug barons 
but bombings apparently by drug traffickers continued tuesday 
and barco said his government will press its 5weekold crackdown 
war on the cartels 
one bomb exploded at a supermarket and seriously injured five 
people and the other went off in the evening at a catholic high 
school the school was closed and there were no injuries there 
police said 
since the government crackdown began there have been 112 
bombings police say the bombs have killed eight people and wounded 
137 
drug traffickers are trying to destroy the most precious thing 
that colombians have their democracy barco said in the speech 
he said that since he declared war on the traffickers security 
forces have sezied 1056 properties from the cocaine lords along 
with 525 vehicles 74 boats and 375 airplanes 
more than 10800 people have been arrested and 535 of them have 
been charged with crimes that link them to drug traffickers barco 
said 
the government claims that the drug lords and an estimated 
10000 guerrillas from six groups work together with the cocaine 
cartels providing money to the insurgents in exchange for armed 
protection 
m19 believed to have about 2000 members is the only 
guerrilla group negotiating with the government 
m19 or may 19 was formed in 1970 by dissidents who claimed a 
presidential election that year was fraudulent 
the group has waged a campaign of assassinations kidnappings 
bombings and armed raids but its actions in recent months have 
been overshadowed by the battle between the government and drug 
barons 
in 1985 m19 guerrillas seized the palace of justice in bogota 
and 95 people were killed during the army assault to recapture the 
building 
barco said british prime minister margaret thatcher had approved 
an aid package for colombia to help fight drug traffickers and that 
aid also was coming from west germany france and argentina he did 
not give details 
the united states has approved 65 million in aid and much of 
it already has arrived in colombia 
barco said he will appeal for help from more countries in an 
address friday before the united nations general assembly

the clarionledger jackson miss on chemical weapons 
president bush received a ringing ovation by representatives of 
the nations around the world when he called chemical weapons a 
scourge of the earth 
the proposal he unveiled before the united nations general 
assembly to destroy more than 80 percent of the united states 
stockpile of those weapons if the soviets reduce arsenals to an 
equal level is praiseworthy but its not as sterling an ambition 
as his wish to have international treaties ban the weapons entirely 
the presidents proposed ban makes sense 
militarily the use of deadly chemicals is a repugnant 
alternative unlike other weapons lethal gases cannot be carefully 
targeted they know no boundaries save the wind 
sooner or later chemical weapons could find their way into the 
hands of terrorists 
the president said more than 20 nations have chemical weapons or 
the capability to produce them 
for the sake of mankind we must halt and reverse this 
threat the president said 
we couldnt agree more

los angeles times on the gorbachev revolution 
the soviet union may be heading for a second october revolution 
this one little more than a year from now when a communist party 
congress convenes ahead of schedule for the purpose of packing the 
important central committee with people who are more in step with 
mikhail s gorbachevs reformist plans 
moving up the date of the next congress by some months was 
approved at last weeks central committee meeting also approved 
was a shakeup in the partys ruling politburo that should work to 
further consolidate gorbachevs power 
steadily and surely the opponents of change along with inept 
and unpopular regional leaders are being pensioned off in favor of 
gorbachev loyalists the october 1990 party congress is expected 
to advance or even complete the consolidation process by providing 
gorbachev with the instrument he needs under party rules to fill 
vacancies on the central committee with his supporters 
for all the talk of powerful opposition to his economic and 
political reform efforts and even widely reported rumors of plots 
to oust him from office gorbachev thus seems to have emerged 
stronger and more in charge than ever before 
the downside could be that in reshaping the party and government 
leadership in his own image gorbachev will lose what until now had 
been a builtin excuse for not making more effective progress more 
quickly

the daily journal vineland nj on the federal election 
commission 
it should come as no surprise that the federal election 
commission set up in 1974 to enforce federal campaign laws 
apparently has not been doing its job 
a common cause study said that the commission has sanctioned 
campaign activities that run counter to central provisions of the 
postwatergate reform laws including the states campaign 
contribution and expenditure limit 
the sixmember commission has on a number of occasions even 
rejected the advice of its attorneys who have argued for 
enforcement of the law 
the commissions real flaw is the people who sit on it and 
given the widespread inattention to ethics throughout government 
these days were not sure how that one will be solved except by 
throwing the blackguards out

the registerguard eugene ore on the brontosaurus stamp 
the postal service is in trouble with some people for putting 
out a stamp with a picture of a dinosaur labeled brontosaurus 
scientists say the correct name for what is popularly known as 
brontosaurus is apatosaurus 
one expert in paleobiology at the smithsonian museum of natural 
history said such willful disregard for the correct name of an 
animal suggests that the postal service cares little for the 
accuracy of the stamps it issues and it prefers cartoon 
nomenclature to scientific nomenclature 
our office dictionary carries nothing under apatosaurus 
but under brontosaurus features a drawing of the beast and a 
definition 
if scientists want the world to get these names straight 
perhaps they should start with the dictionary publishers 
the postal services error will provide a benefit the 
controversy accompanying their issue will produce more instant 
knowledge about this question of nomenclature among both children 
and adults than could ever be achieved by books or classes

words he loves me and a blank space next to the words he

likely among their american counterparts as well option b he 
loves me not seems to be in vogue 
a survey of 6911 white middleclass college males in canada 
found that 80 percent of them were aware of the role condoms played 
in curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases yet only 19 
percent of the students who were sexually active said they used 
condoms regularly an amazing 26 percent said they never used them 
these guys are dancing with death not only for themselves but 
for their sexual partners as well of course the images of sex they 
often see in movies on television in books and magazines 
seldom leave the fantasy world far enough to have lovers 
incorporate condoms into their passion but unprotected sex is not 
fantasy it is reality and it can have fatal consequences

the proposal by sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky to allow law

can you imagine the embarrassment as well as the anguish when

president bush has declared war on drug trafficking and we 
endorse every resonable means to stop this terrible blight on our 
country but we dont think the president meant open warfare which 
seems to be mcconnells goal 
his fellow senator from kentucky wendell ford tried to kill 
the amendment last month and now rep larry hopkins rky says 
he will use his influence on the senatehouse conference committee 
to eliminate this part of the bill since the house version has no

the morning news tribune tacoma wash on smoking during 
flights 
the us senate and the american tobacco industry go back a long 
way over the years whenever congress would try to pass a law 
protecting nonsmokers an alliance of tobaccofinanced senators 
could always be counted on to kill or weaken it 
thats why the senates recent action on inflight smoking is so 
encouraging for once the senate has taken the hard line against 
tobacco interests pushing aside sen jesse helms rnc and 
other members of the tobacco caucus the full senate approved 
an amendment that would ban smoking on all airline flights in the 
united states 
most air travelers 80 percent of whom dont smoke will 
applaud the measure airlines currently maintain separate seating 
sections for smokers usually in the rear of the airplane but the 
air in a pressurized cabin is recirculated partially filtered 
smoke permeates the entire compartment this may pose genuine 
health risks for asthmatics and flight attendants for other 
passengers it can be an obnoxious annoying nuisance 
if the senate is going to start standing up to helms and 
company the tobacco lobby will have a much tougher time buying 
influence in high places the industry has lost a lot of its old 
influence in state capitals no fewer than 44 states have enacted 
laws restricting smoking in lobbies stores restaurants and other 
public places and most companies now restrict smoking in shared 
work areas its a healthy trend

washington ap president bush said today that he wont be 
deterred by rumors that colombian drug lords have threatened to 
kidnap one of his five children if the us and colombian 
governments dont grant them amnesty 
i cant do my job if i get deterred by rumors bush told 
reporters in the oval office 
however the president confirmed that secret service protection 
had been increased for his children 
but that to the degree security has been stepped up in 
accordance with the law on the bush kids it is not becausse of a 
specific hard piece of intelligence hard threat and im 
confident of that bush said 
new york newsday quoted unidentified intelligence sources in 
todays editions as saying that they believe bushs 30yearold 
daughter dorothy leblond is most vulnerable to an attack 
the sources told the newspaper the kidnap threat also applied to 
top us officials involved in antidrug efforts the sources 
declined to elaborate 
the threats surfaced about two weeks after bushs sept 5 speech 
outlining his strategy against drug smuggling and abuse the 
sources said 
in addition to leblond a businesswoman in portland maine the 
bushes have four sons george john neil and marvin 
bush asked if he had any information on the newsday report 
said i do not and i have a feeling that that matter is of 
enough interest to me that it would have been brought to my 
attention 
increased surveillance of the children had been reported 
previously but word of a possible kidnapping was new the newspaper 
said 
richard abrams a secret service spokesman would neither 
confirm nor deny that protection for the bush family was increased 
security is always tight as you know abrams said 
initially the bush children had resisted extra security but all 
finally agreed to an increased secret service presence the 
newspaper said

sinhalese radicals shot and killed 
three people wednesday the military said the same day the 
government began a ceasefire aimed at encouraging the radicals to 
begin peace talks 
the victims were a train driver a government labor officer and 
a bodyguard of a provincial council member 
soldiers halted military operations against sinhalese militants 
at 6 am and said the ceasefire would last three days 
less than four hours later sinhalese militants shot and killed 
a bodyguard of jayasinghe bandara a member of the governments 
provincial council military officials said the gunmen ambushed 
bandaras car in baddula district 80 miles east of colombo but 
bandara escaped unharmed 
the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said the radicals also shot to death a train driver and a 
government labor officer and torched 10 government buses in central 
and southern sri lanka 
however about 50 sinhalese radicals took advantage of the 
ceasefire and surrendered at several military camps the officials 
said 
the government hopes its ceasefire will encourage radicals of 
the peoples liberation front to put down their weapons and open 
peace talks with the government 
the front began its campaign to overthrow the 
sinhalesedominated government in july 1987 after the president 
signed an accord aimed at ending a war for independence by the 
minority tamils 
many sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population said 
the accord granted too many concessions to the tamils who account 
for 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
a statement said the decision to call the ceasefire was made 
during a meeting last week between president ranasinghe premadasa 
and the five major opposition party leaders 
if the armed militant groups respond favorably to this call 
this period of three days would be extended the statement 
said 
the ceasefire was one of 10 points in a plan proposed by the 
opposition and intended to end the campaign of strikes 
assassinations and terror inspired by sinhalese radicals 
the government said troops will suspend all raids and search 
operations but will help police maintain law and order 
more than 200000 leaflets in the sinhalese language were 
dropped from airplanes by government troops tuesday over remote 
villages the leaflets offered rewards up to 510 to extremists who 
surrender

the missile frigate that led the 
fight in a major usiranian battle has returned to the persian 
gulf but sailors find themselves patrolling sealanes becalmed by 
more than a year of peace 
its much harder to convince people they need to stay 
constantly alert when theres nothing going on said lt cmdr 
wally bloss the ships executive officer 
bloss described the current situation as boring for the 100 
or so battle veterans aboard the jack williams at least compared 
with early 1988 when the gulf tanker war was at its peak and 
us warships protecting americanflagged vessels faced constant 
threats by iranian forces 
there have been no reported incidents in the gulf since iraq and 
iran agreed to a ceasefire aug 20 1988 ending their 8yearold 
war foreignflag ships no longer fear iranian gunboat attacks and 
tehrans own ships sail unmolested by iraqi bombers 
the united states having cut its gulfbased force from 16 to 10 
ships scaled back further this month by deactivating the hercules 
the last of two oncesecret barges set up in 1987 as bases for army 
helicopters and navy patrol boats to disrupt iranian minelaying 
and raids on commercial shipping 
like other us ships the jack williams still maintains a 
wartime condition called modified zebra in which watertight 
doors and hatches can be sealed off in seconds six lookouts are 
posted at all times including a special mine watch on the bow 
to spot drifting mines 
precautions also include going to general quarters or 
battle stations when entering the silkworm envelope the 
110mile strait of hormuz within range of irans chinesemade 
antiship missiles 
since returning to the gulf in early august for a threemonth 
tour of duty the ship based in mayport fla has had one close 
call a tail rotor failed on aug 27 sending a helicopter to the 
water before pilots regained control 
such incidents though hairraising pale next to april 18 
1988 when us and iranian forces engaged in a oneday battle 
later called the most important naval surface action involving us 
warships since world war ii 
two iranian oil rigs were destroyed and six vessels including 
two naval frigates sunk or damaged in operation praying mantis a 
us reprisal for the nearsinking of the missile frigate uss samuel 
b roberts by an iranian mine 
iran later acknowledged several dozen casualties the united 
states lost a helicopter gunship and its twoman crew to hostile 
action hours after the fighting ended 
mementos such as the unit commanders flag and a defense 
department battle citation are displayed in the crews mess as 
reminders of the jack williams role directing air and missile 
strikes while dodging what were believed to be at least four of 
irans silkworm missiles 
the pentagon later insisted that iran had not fired any 
missiles it said electronic analysis showed us radar operators 
had misinterpreted the blips of american missiles as hostile 
there is little sympathy for that explanation among the ships 
battle veterans although preferring not to be quoted by name some 
say they remain convinced silkworms were fired 
skeptics suggest the truth was concealed because us officials 
decided iran had been punished enough and feared that fulfilling a 
previous vow to retaliate for any silkworm firings would inflame 
the situation 
i dont suppose the issue will ever be resolved to everyones 
satisfaction a senior officer said 
being in the headlines had led the jack williams to expect a 
heros welcome at mayport but by the time it arrived home two 
months later the public had pretty much forgotten about praying 
mantis bloss said 
except for some local coverage it was just like any other 
homecoming he said we didnt mind we were glad to be back

whats so wrong with americas 
schools that the president his cabinet and the nations governors 
must retreat to this quiet college town to spend two days searching 
for solutions 
after all the nation is pouring 353 billion into education 
thats 5246 per pupil this year 29 percent more in real 
inflationadjusted dollars than in 1981 according to federal 
estimates 
but all that money and a decadelong clamor for school reform 
seem to have hardly dented the national deficit in what students 
know about the world around them 
bush the governors and educators all have expressed hope the 
summit on wednesday and thursday will be a first step in supplying 
us schools with something theyve never had before national 
goals and standards 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
met privately wednesday here with govs garrey carruthers of new 
mexico and booth gardner of washington and said the governors 
had a sense of optimism that the meeting can come up with some 
general goals to take home to their states 
but the governors have some question about whether the meeting 
can put together a plan to meet those goals thats not going to 
happen in two days geiger said adding that with over 900 
reporters crowded onto the university of virginia campus the 
only sure thing is that this is a big media event 
bush and others believe that in an increasingly competitive 
world economic climate its high time the nations schools agreed 
on what students at different grade levels should know 
a raft of recent reports suggest they dont know plenty 
less than half the nations fifthgraders know enough basic 
science to realize it takes a few days to travel to the moon 
twothirds of high school students know so little economics 
they cant define profits 
fewer than one in four high school juniors know when abraham 
lincoln was president or that tennessee williams wrote a 
streetcar named desire 
in a comparison with pupils from 20 nations us students 
ranked 10th in eighthgrade arithmetic 12th in algebra and 16th 
in geometry 
seventysix percent of us 17yearolds are unable to write 
adequate imaginative prose 
despite the muchballyhooed classroom computer revolution 
a majority of us students remain computer illiterates unable 
for example to correctly explain the role of a computer program 
scores on college entrance exams notably the scholastic 
aptitude test have stagnated for the past five years and the 
performance gaps between whites and blacks and between males and 
females are huge and growing 
tests show that elementary schools are doing better at teaching 
the basics such as reading and arithmetic but a federal 
critique of us grade schools also found that pupils leave with 
the idea that science is a bore history is a laundry list of 
unconnected events and art and music are mainly about 
fingerpainting and kazoos 
finally some 23 million adults in the richest nation on earth 
cannot read at acceptable levels 
since the 1983 federal report a nation at risk kicked off 
the current reform movement with its conclusion that americas 
schools had sunk into mediocrity states and local districts have 
tried strategy after strategy to turn schools around 
states now require students even 4 and 5yearolds to pass 
competency tests twentyseven states have enacted tougher teacher 
training standards fortysix states have made teacher competency 
testing mandatory average teacher salaries have risen by over 
onethird since 1981 to about 29000 
reformers first demanded that schools go back to basics then 
they counseled that schools be restructured to give students more 
individual attention and teachers more authority 
the latest push from bush and others is for parents to have 
more choice over where their kids can attend school the resulting 
competition would make all schools better according to that 
belief which is challenged by others 
student progress after a decade of such reform ferment has been 
at best debatable 
the plain truth bush said earlier this month is that our 
educational system is not making the grade spending more money on 
education than most countries were getting less return on the 
investment it is time for change perhaps radical change 
most educators agree that the 1980s reform movement helped 
students improve basic skills but american youngsters remain 
illequipped to compete in a complex hightech job market where 
critical thinking skills are allimportant 
hence the summit

the norwegian state railroads luck was on 
the wrong track this week 
the trouble started monday when sparks from a bonfire lit by 
railroad workers set fire to a wooden structure used to keep snow 
off the tracks 
workers rolled out fire hoses only to find that a defective 
coupling had cut water pressure they fixed the coupling but the 
old hoses ruptured when the pressure increased 
the blazing structure then collapsed onto the tracks and the 
heat warped the rails 
the newspaper bergens tidene said about 1000 passengers were 
stranded for hours in the mountains outside bergen and finally put 
onto buses 
we had certain technical problems traffic manager lars 
bjoerndal was quoted as saying 
no one was injured in the mishaps

british filmmakerplaywright david hare thinks 
american love stories arent very realistic 
and he considers his latest work strapless a romantic 
drama starring blair brown and bridget fonda far more believable 
than current hollywood offerings strapless will have its 
premiere at the new york film festival which began sept 22 
after a recent screening the british director and he two 
costars talked about romantic comedies 
he attacked rob reiners hit movie when harry met sally 
for failing to integrate the lead characters into the outside 
world 
at no point was there any reference to the characters jobs 
or to what their relationships were outside dating said hare 
they were people who dated that was their primary social 
function they either were happy or unhappy according to whether 
they were dating 
its this way of looking at the world through people who exist 
in rooms and the minute the door closes everything that is the 
world is shut out of that room and you are simply together eating 
lasagna or spaghetti or whatever kind of pasta the scene is about 
in strapless brown stars as a 40yearold american doctor 
working in a london hospital and living with her rebellious younger 
sister fonda while on holiday brown is pursued by a romantic 
entrepreneur bruno ganz who follows her back to london and 
eventually persuades her to marry him 
but ganz substantially in debt suddenly flees and brown is 
forced to put her life back together again and provide support for 
fonda who has become pregnant after a brief affair 
hare who also wrote the screenplay said he enjoyed the 
challenge of creating female characters theres nothing harder 
to get than a member of the opposite sex i know the benefit of 
writing about women is you have such an extraordinary range of 
underused actresses actresses able to do all sorts of things 
theyre not ususally given a chance to 
hare also directed the 1984 drama wetherby and wrote the 
play and screenplay plenty meryl streep starred in the film 
version 
strapless currently has no distributor but hare said a deal 
would be announced soon

officials speaking on condition they not to be identified 
it was not clear whether plo visa applications were received 
only from those two officials 
there had been speculation that plo chairman yasser arafat might 
request a visa and the state department has refused to say whether 
it would approve a request from him 
on tuesday more than twothirds of the senate urged the bush 
administration to deny any visa request from arafat to address the 
general assembly 
the united states ended its efforts to isolate the plo last 
december after arafat at us urging said publicly he renounced 
terrorism and accepted israels right to exist

attorney general richard thornburgh today 
said 229 million seized from drug traffickers and organized crime 
groups will be used to build more than 3000 new federal prison 
cells 
the money ordered transferred from the justice departments 
asset forfeiture fund to the federal bureau of prisons is a 
downpayment on president bushs proposed 15 billion in prison 
construction thornburgh told an annual gathering of federal 
prosecutors 
this is one of the nicer ironies of our times thornburgh 
said were now taking that money and turning it against those 
criminals from whom it was so justly taken talk about poetic 
justice this is that 
since october 1988 agencies within the justice department 
seized property valued at more than 1 billion more than 500 
million in forfeited and liquidated criminal property has been 
deposited into the asset forfeiture fund thornburgh said 
about 150 million of that seized money has been shared with 
local law enforcement agencies 
its i think satisfying to think that its now possible for 
a drug dealer to serve time in a forfeiturefinanced prison after 
being arrested by agents driving a forfeitureprovided automobile 
while working in a forfeiturefunded sting operation the 
attorney general said to rousing applause from about 150 people 
the asset forfeiture fund has increased in yearly receipts from 
272 million in 1985 to more than 500 million so far this year

congress probably will need to come up with 
about 4 billion over the next few years to rescue the fund that 
has helped millions of americans buy houses with fha loans the 
governments chief auditor said today 
charles a bowsher head of the general accounting office told 
a senate panel the taxpayer money will be needed because the 
federal housing administration sustained a 42 billion loss in 
1988 that plunged the fha insurance fund 29 billion into the red 
that is the first time the agency has been in the hole 
the outgoing reagan administration previously reported losses of 
more than 800 million in the fha fund in 1988 less than 
onefourth the amount gao auditors calculated 
bowsher said further losses must be anticipated in the next few 
years as homeowners who have taken out governmentbacked loans 
recently in economically depressed regions of the country find 
themselves unable to keep up their payments 
the current losses the gao chief said stem from a combination 
of hard economic times in what he called oil patch states and 
mismanagement at the department of housing and urban development 
which administers the fha 
basic management weaknesses must be corrected if future losses 
are to be brought under control bowsher said in a report to the 
senate banking housing and urban affairs housing subcommittee 
in testimony accompanying the report bowsher told the panel he 
believes new hud management is moving to correct past problems 
which he blamed partially on inadequate congressional oversight 
i dont think were in a free fall bowsher said what we 
have here is a program in trouble 
he said his audit staff had received full cooperation from hud 
assistant secretary c austin fitts who appeared with him at the 
subcommittee hearing 
we acknowledge that fha has incurred substantial losses she 
said the bad news is out on the table we believe the problems 
are manageable and fixable 
she asked in advance for congressional support for some reforms 
she said hud secretary jack kemp will be outlining soon for housing 
programs and introduced two top assistants from wall street she 
said she has recruited to help shore up management of the agencys 
fha programs 
we cant wring our hands about the past said sen alan 
cranston dcalif the subcommittee chairman 
he complimented ms fitts for her initial efforts and said we 
will pursue any legislative remedies that are necessary to make fha 
a strong and responsive institution that is able to serve the 
housing needs of future generations in all parts of this country as 
magnificently as it served the needs of the american people years 
ago 
bowsher outlined the basic problems with fha for the same 
subcommittee in august but did not have specific loss figures in 
that preliminary report

melissa ann roush to her father rodney roush hey also voided

president bush said wednesday there is a 
good likelihood he and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
be able to sign a landmark treaty to slash the deadliest weapons in 
the superpowers nuclear arsenals in a summit meeting next year 
bush said that the scheduling of a summit in late spring or 
early summer will serve as a catalyst for moving forward on a 
treaty and that it may be ready by the summit 
its not absolutely certain that thats going to happen but i 
would have to agree there is a good likelihood that might 
happen bush said in an interview with a small group of reporters 
in the oval office 
bushs statement put him in sync with an optimistic forecast by 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who told the united 
nations on tuesday there are realistic prospects by the time of 
the summit for passing the last turn on the road to a strategic 
arms reduction treaty start to trim 30 to 50 percent from the 
each nations arsenals of longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines 
i dont want to set it up so that if we dont have every t 
crossed and i dotted on a treaty that the summit is 
considered a failure bush said but he said he agreed with 
shevardnadzes statement 
bush held the news conference after delivering a speech before 
the annual meeting of the world bank and international monetary 
fund and before flying to charlottesville va for a meeting with 
the nations governors to improve the countrys education system 
he said he was looking forward to a candid and very 
freeflowing discussion at the twoday meeting at the university 
of virginia bush predicted the sessions would result in strong 
consensus for national educational goals as well as in greater 
flexibility in the way states can use federal education aid 
moreover bush said theres a strong recognition among the 
governors that we need accountability for achieving results 
relating to the goals 
on another subject bush confirmed that security has been 
tightened around his four sons and one daughter all of them 
adults but said it was not in response to any hard threat 
from colombian drug lords 
asked about a published report that drug barons had threatened 
to kidnap one of his children unless granted amnesty bush said 
i have not heard that and i feel confident i would have if 
thered been what i call hard intelligence 
expressing confidence in the secret services ability to protect 
his family bush said i dont live in fear of anything like that 
i cant do my job if i get deterred by rumors 
on other subjects 
bush balked at a soviet proposal to go beyond the plan he 
outlined earlier this week to the un general assembly for deep 
cuts in the superpowers chemical weapon stockpiles asked if he 
would accept the kremlins offer to eliminate all poison gas from 
us and soviet arsenals bush said no absolutely not we need 
a certain sense of deterrence 
the president said i would have difficulty eliminating all 
testing of nuclear weapons bush said he was willing to discuss 
soviet proposals to ban testing but added we do have some 
differences on it with gorbachev 
bush avoided making a commitment for additional us aid for 
poland beyond the 219 million in economic and food aid already 
promised saying he wanted to see what kinds of reforms poland 
adopts bush said lets move apace lets see what it is that is 
required in terms of reform and then well try to do everything we 
can 
the path toward a start treaty became brighter last week when 
the soviets in two major concessions said they would not let 
their objections to the us star wars missile defense program and 
to submarinelaunched cruise missiles stand in the way of a nuclear 
arms pact 
the spirit that prevailed in wyoming is just one more 
manifestation that we dont have a disconnect with mr gorbachev 
on sovietus relations bush said and that spirit will 
obviously make it much easier to discuss contentious regional 
issues or arms control issues 
at the same time bush said the united states must still regard 
the soviets as an adversary from a military standpoint 
i want to have a prudent defense policy bush said i 
dont want to do something naive or silly in defense just because 
we are working more closely with the soviets today 
the president echoed warnings by defense secretary dick cheney 
that the united states must not drop its guard in anticipation of a 
less militant policy by moscow 
bush told the reporters 
cheneys voice is loud and clear and hes saying dont do 
something dumb dont make the mistake of unilaterally disarming 
knocking out strategic modernization programs at the very minute 
that the soviet union is going forward on the modernization front 
and thats good advice for the president of the united states 
and believe me it is needed and good advice for the congress of 
the united states 
bush noted that he has been criticized by democrats for being 
too timid in dealing with arms proposals from the kremlin i 
think the team that i have knows what its doing he said

production company in a cash deal valued at 34 billion 
sonys us subsidiary sony usa inc said a tender offer of 
27 a share had been approved by columbias board of directors 
subject to certain conditions but that it expected to complete the 
acquisition by early november 
cocacola co columbias largest shareholder at 49 percent 
said it had signed an option agreement to tender its stake subject 
to ratification by the cocacola board which was expected at a 
meeting next monday 
the deal had been widely rumored since monday when columbia 
disclosed it was in buyout talks with a third party that it refused 
to identify 
the buyout of columbia which began as a tiny studio in 1920 and 
grew into a major hollywood force is the latest chapter in a wave 
of consolidation that has swept through the entertainment industry 
columbias chairman donald r keough said sony was an ideal 
buyer 
it has all the right characteristics and very importantly has 
the ability to take the company to its next important step he 
said 
michael schulhof vice chairman of sony corp of america said 
the purchase of a major film studio extends sonys longterm 
strategy of building a total entertainment business around the 
synergy of audio and video hardware and software 
he said the electronics giant will place daytoday operation 
operation of columbia in us hands and keep it as independent as 
possible as a fullfledged member of the us film industry 
columbia said victor kaufman its president and chief executive 
and lew korman chief operating officer will resign once the deal 
is completed 
there were published reports today that peter guber was expected 
to replace kaufman guber who coproduced batman rainman 
and flashdance is considered one of hollywoods top producers 
columbia owns two major film studios columbia pictures and 
tristar pictures but its boxoffice results have been 
disappointing in recent years among its recent releases are 
ghostbusters ii the karate kid part iii and casualties 
of war 
it has been a more impressive force on television where it has 
produced or distributed 11 primetime series including five new 
shows among its productions are whos the boss and designing 
women 
columbia also about 820 movie screens in 220 locations and a 
library of more than 2700 films and 23000 tv episodes 
in other media deals mgmua accepted a 15 billion buyout 
offer earlier this month from the qintex group of australia 
time warner inc is on the verge of completing its acquisition 
of warner communications inc which owns the warner bros movie

president bush headed for a twoday 
education summit with the nations governors today predicting a 
strong consensus for overhauling public schools and improving 
classroom performance but he rejected any major new federal 
spending 
meeting with reporters before leaving the white house the 
president said he was looking forward to a candid and very 
freeflowing discussion with the governors and anticipated much 
agreement for greater flexibility in the use of federal funds 
for the schools 
im hopeful were going to come out of the summit with a 
commitment to restructure and to make those fundamental changes 
that are needed if we are going to improve educational 
performance bush said 
but the president balked at suggestions by several governors for 
expansion of the head start program for needy preschool children 
and other federal school programs bush said were not going to 
quintuple spending while struggling to reduce the budget deficit 
our problem is not money our problem is using the money that 
is there effectively white house chief of staff john sununu said 
on nbctvs today show 
after a helicopter flight from washington bush planned to join 
the governors in a series of closeddoor discussions on 
revitalizing the teaching profession improving the learning 
environment including keeping drugs out of schools and deciding 
whos in charge of the schools 
even as the governors gathered on the university of virginia 
campus under clear sunny skies there was grumbling about white 
house limitations on the role and visibility of the governors 
at the summit 
with more than 900 reporters covering the talks the only sure 
thing is that this is a big media event said keith geiger 
president of the national education association and according to 
at least one governor thats the way the white house wanted it 
democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas told his fellow 
governors in a memorandum monday that white house officials were 
keeping them on a short leash at the summit 
he complained that the white house refused to make any of the 
working sessions public barred staff members from meetings between 
governors and cabinet members and allow only administration 
officials to prepare a summary of the discussions 
roger porter a domestic policy aide to bush and the chief 
summit planner was reported to have replied that the governors had 
approved of the original summit scenario but clinton press 
secretary mike gauldin said porter agreed to clintons request for 
the governors to bring notetaking aides to the meetings 
geiger said govs garrey carruthers of new mexico and booth 
gardner of washington told him they were optimistic that the summit 
could produce some general goals but questioned whether a plan 
could be developed for meeting those goals thats not going to 
happen in two days geiger said 
the president was expected to resist any demands for hefty 
increases in federal spending on education which currently 
accounts for 467 billion of the 353 billion spent at the 
federal state and local levels 
education secretary lauro cavazos a former college president 
led bushs entire cabinet with the exception of secretary of state 
james baker iii to the summit most of the governors were bringing 
along their top school superintendents or education advisers 
bush said tuesday in washington that he wanted to listen and 
work with the governors not try to impose an agenda from here 
his aim he said was to see us come up with some suggestions 
that will dramatically change things 
not since 1933 when franklin d roosevelt called together the 
governors in the midst of the great depression have the states 
chief executives and the president joined forces to examine one 
pressing issue 
by merely inviting the governors to the summit bush has drawn 
unprecedented attention to the failings of the nations schools and 
dismal academic achievements of students 
i think we will establish the fact that we need measurable 
national goals bush said today and this i am told most of 
the governors agree on 
the governors headed for the summit with plenty of their own 
ideas 
democratic gov evan bayh of indiana said he wants national 
goals to boost pupil achievement scores reduce teenage 
pregnancies and lower the school dropout rate and assurances that 
each state will have flexibility to meet its school needs free of 
federal intervention 
although some governors insisted that more federal money is 
essential bayh asserted that just throwing money at the problem 
is not all there is to something as complex as education 
georgia gov joe frank harris a democrat said what is 
needed most critically from the president and the federal 
government in the area of education is leadership 
after a state dinner tonight in a tent outside monticello 
jeffersons home near the university bush and the governors are to 
reassemble thursday morning for more working sessions a luncheon 
convocation and a finale at which republican and democratic 
governors will join bush in delivering closing statements

a former top assistant to onetime housing 
secretary samuel r pierce jr cited his fifth amendment rights 
today in refusing to answer substantive questions by a 
congressional panel about the scandals at hud 
lance wilson once pierces executive assistant appeared under 
subpoena but refused to answer most questions 
that means pierce and his two closest aides at hud wilson and 
his successor as executive assistant deborah gore dean have all 
refused to respond to questions by the house subcommittee probing 
allegations of influencepeddling fraud and mismanagement at the 
department of housing and urban development 
wilson read a brief statement saying statements made by the 
subcommittee members convinced me the subcommittee had already 
prejudged me and identified him as a prime candidate for a 
criminal investigation 
committee chairman tom lantos dcalif then posed a series of 
four questions to wilson who refused to answer each one 
although wilson said he would answer no substantive 
questions he later responded to two questions put to him by rep 
christopher shays rconn 
shays asked if the hud inspector general who earlier this year 
released a report finding widespread problems in the departments 
moderate rehabilitation housing subsidy program had sought to talk 
to him about that program and if wilson had done so 
wilson responded that he had been asked to meet with the 
inspector general but did not do so asked to explain why he did 
not meet with the inspector general wilson refused to answer 
outside the courtroom wilsons attorney raymond banoun charged 
that members of the subcommittee were trying to grandstand and 
had spent much of the meeting ridiculing someone for exercising 
his rights 
they dont want to know the truth banoun said 
as pierce had done a day earlier wilson used a house rule to 
bar television radio and photographic coverage of his appearance 
the panel also planned today to question donald maron chief 
executive officer of paine webber about the companys dealings 
with hud wilson went to work for paine webber after leaving hud 
and helped the company obtain hud business 
pierce in a dramatic session tuesday appeared under order of 
subpoena before the house government operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing 
lantos and other committee members responded today to pierces 
charge that he had been prejudged by the panel 
lantos said the panel has not prejudged pierces potential 
criminal culpability but had reached a judgment about his tenure as 
secretary of hud for eight years 
he was a miserable secretary of hud lantos said the 
record of hud is clear its there for all to see 
rep bruce morrison dconn called for a grand jury 
investigation of the toplevel hud activities during pierces 
administration he said the justice department should view this 
not just as a case of mismanagement and mistaken judgment at the 
highest levels of hud but an instance in which whitecollar crime 
may well have occurred 
despite congressional protests that he was throwing up 
roadblocks in their investigation pierce read a brief statement 
saying he had not had time to prepare did not have the hud 
documents he needed and would invoke his constitutional right not 
to testify 
the subcommittees desire to rush me through this process 
together with various statements made by members leads me to 
the painful conclusion that i hae been prejudged by this body 
pierce said 
under these circumstances my counsel has advised me and i 
have agreed to assert my constitutional rights under the fifth and 
sixth amendments by refusing to answer questions before this 
subcommittee he said i trust this subcommittee will remember 
that these rights are intended as shields for the innocent and that 
they do not create any inference or presumption of wrongdoing 
paul l perito his attorney said pierce might be ready to 
testify on oct 27 the next date he has been ordered before the 
panel but outside the committee room perito told reporters the 
subcommittee wouldnt give pierce a fair hearing 
they want to try convict and sentence him and we will not 
let that occur perito said this man is an innocent man 
wilsons appearance under subpoena follows his refusal to appear 
aug 18 before the panel and his refusal to comply with its 
subpoena demanding records of his dealings with hud after leaving 
government 
after leaving the agency wilson invested in several projects 
that received lucrative subsidies from hud and helped his employer 
paine webber obtain business with hud 
banoun said a report by paine webber attorneys who questioned 
wilson concluded there was nothing improper in his conduct or in 
matters related between paine webber and hud 
dean wilsons successor as pierces executive assistant 
appeared before congress in may but refused to answer questions 
asserting her fifth amendment rights as well

capital gains tax will be a vote for a tax increase and said 
any additional us aid to the noncommunist government in poland 
would depend on economic reform in that eastern bloc nation 
longrange weapons talks in geneva have been deadlocked but 
within the past week the soviets removed two major obstacles to a 
stratetgic arms reduction treaty start which would cut by 30 
percent to 50 percent the warheads carried on longrange bombers 
and missiles 
in the biggest development soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze told secretary of state james a baker iii that moscow 
would not let its objections to the us star wars program block 
completion of a treaty but would insist on compliance to a 1972 
treaty that bans spacebased defenses 
shevardnadze also told baker the soviets would agree to a 
separate deal on limiting submarinelaunched cruise missiles which 
they had wanted to include in the start talks 
bush hailed the improvement in ussoviet relations 
particularly the array of agreements reached by shevardnadze and 
baker

gen michel aoun told christian lawmakers 
to oppose political reforms contained in an arab league peace plan 
until syria agrees to withdraw its forces from lebanon sources 
said wednesday 
both moslem and christian lawmakers are to meet in saudi arabia 
on saturday to discuss political reforms called for in the peace 
plan since march syrian forces have been aiding moslem factions 
fighting aouns christian troops 
a christian source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
aoun had passed the message to several parliamentary deputies 
to oppose the political reforms which call for moslems to have a 
greater say in governing this divided nation 
the prosyrian ashsharq daily accused aoun of obstructing the 
peace process by bringing pressure to bear on legislators not to 
attend the meeting in saudi arabia 
a sunni moslem parliamentarian speaking on condition of 
anonymity alleged aoun wanted to do his best to prevent a 
parliamentary quorum in saudi arabia because he fears that 
legislators might elect a president there 
twothirds of the 73 parliamentarians constitutes a quorum 
which is needed to elect a president 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 22 1988 
when president amin gemayels sixyear term expired with parliament 
unable to elect a successor that political crisis triggered the 
latest spasm of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
in damascus syrian vice president khaddam held talks with 
moslem legislators and a prosyrian christian deputy michel daher 
who was syrias candidate to succeed gemayel last year 
syrian officials referred to daher as the lebanese 
presidential candidate that indicated they may present him again 
if the legislators make headway in saudi arabia 
the proposed reforms call for lebanons maronite catholics the 
dominant christian sect to surrender the privileges they have held 
since independence from france in 1943 and share power equally with 
moslems 
in 1943 the christians were considered the majority but 
moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of the countrys 4 
million people 
aoun a maronite fought the syrians for six months of savage 
artillery battles in a bid to force them to pull out of lebanon 
where they have had a military presence since 1976 
he claims the syrians who support the moslems are an 
occupation army 
the syrians long the main power brokers in lebanon consider 
the country vital to their strategic defense against israel which 
occupies a border strip in south lebanon 
aoun reluctantly accepted the arab league plan even though it 
made no specific mention of a syrian withdrawal 
a ceasefire called by the arab league saturday generally was 
holding wednesday despite sporadic sniper clashes on beiruts 
dividing green line and the other fronts in the north and the 
eastern mountains 
three christian legislators crossed beiruts dividing green line 
in a rare foray into moslem west beirut and held a lengthy meeting 
with shiite moslem parliament speaker hussein husseini at his home 
the arab league plan calls for increasing the number of seats in 
lebanons onechamber parliament to 128 to be divided equally 
between moslems and christians 
it also proposed stripping the president of the authority to 
appoint and dismiss prime ministers who would be elected instead 
by parliament

after decades of pressing for freer emigration 
american officials said tuesday that a boom in wouldbe immigrants 
likely will force the united states to turn away more than 200000 
soviets in the next year 
many never would have tried to leave the country before the 
soviet union liberalized its emigration procedures some jews and 
other groups that long have been an american priority are worrying 
they will be forgotten 
refuseniks believe new us procedures going into effect oct 1 
are sure to limit jewish emigration to the united states at a time 
when they say antisemitism is on the rise in the soviet union 
the situation here is getting worse elena rappoport a 
leader of the jewish refusenik group poor relatives said in an 
interview 
us embassy officials following ceilings set in washington 
said they will accept 50000 soviet refugees next year and permit 
an additional 20000 to 30000 to enter the country on a parole 
system parolees are not given the same federal assistance as other 
refugees 
thats more than the roughly 50000 the united states will admit 
this year but only a fraction of the 300000 applications embassy 
officials said they expect to receive next year the us embassy 
says it is receiving about 10000 applications a month or about 
90000 so far this year 
there is a limit to the number of soviet emigrants and to the 
number of emigrants the united states can take a us embassy 
official said 
the united states is appealing to other western countries to 
help said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
nowhere is it written that the united states should be the 
only destination of soviets who want to emigrate he said 
under the new regulations wouldbe refugees must fill out a 
questionnaire that will be sent directly to washington for 
consideration 
based on a review giving priority to those with relatives in the 
united states or members of groups considered to be persecuted in 
the soviet union such as jewish refuseniks and pentacostalists 
officials in washington will send notices to those who qualify for 
interviews at the moscow embassy 
us officials acknowledged that the system depends on the 
notoriously slow and unreliable soviet mail they say applicants 
who hear nothing after several months will have to assume they are 
being rejected and they said it is possible that people who face 
persecution in the soviet union and therefore qualify for refugee 
status may fall through the cracks 
threequarters of the spaces are likely to go to people with 
parents children brothers sisters or spouses already in the 
united states embassy officials say 
jews will no longer be able to leave the country on an israeli 
visa and then apply for admission to the united states in vienna or 
rome where thousands are now waiting 
the us official said new procedures will save the money spent 
on them in rome or vienna estimated at more than 30 million and 
allow it to be used to increase emigration 
the new procedure also is intended to cut down on the long lines 
outside the us embassy in moscow the line to receive an 
application was said at one point to include thousands of people 
and a spot at the front of the line reportedly cost hundreds of 
dollars in bribes to soviet police 
jews and armenians together still make up the vast majority of 
the applicants but us officials are seeing large increases in 
applications from others 
they said 10 percent or more than 1000 of the applicants in 
august were ethnic russians few with relatives in the united 
states 
one wouldbe applicant 18yearold vladimir azarov of moscow 
said he had some brushes with the law because of his political 
views and wanted to receive political refugee status 
its not that i have a big reason to leave the soviet union 
its just that i want to live in the united states he said

confederate flag as the school flag after some said they found it 
racially offensive 
about 200 parents and students packed tuesdays meeting room and 
spilled outside where members of the jackson association of 
concerned parents paraded and waved large rebel flags

the rebel flag wouldnt be allowed on campus or at any school 
event when several students carried flags to an oncampus football

president bush said wednesday that he wont be 
deterred by rumors that colombian drug lords have made threats 
against his five children but he confirmed that security had been 
increased for his family 
i have confidence in the secret service and their ability to 
do their job bush told a group of reporters in the oval office 
the president was skeptical of a published report that drug 
lords had threatened to kidnap one of his children if us and 
colombian governments dont grant them amnesty bush has pledged an 
allout war against colombian drug traffickers 
the story in wednesdays editions of new york newsday quoted 
unidentified washington intelligence sources 
however bush said intelligence officials never mentioned such a 
threat to him and i have a feeling that that matter is of enough 
interest to me that it would have been brought to my attention 
i dont mean to be complacent but i have confidence in our 
intelligence community bush said 
although heightened security had been noticed recently around 
bushs family it was the first time anyone in the government had 
confirmed it publicly 
there had been earlier reports of possible threats by colombian 
drug figures against the presidents family and us officials 
that icluded congressional testimony earlier this month from a 
former drug dealer who suggested hit squads already might be in 
this country 
to the degree security has been stepped up in accordance with 
the law and the bush kids it is not because of a specific hard 
piece of intelligence hard threat im confident of that bush 
said 
so i dont live in fear of anything like this i cant do 
my job if i get deterred by rumors he said 
newsday quoted the intelligence sources as saying they believed 
the most vulnerable to a kidnapping was bushs youngest child 
dorothy leblond 30 a portland maine businesswoman 
the bushes also have four sons george john neil and marvin 
the sources told the newspaper the kidnap threat also applied to 
top us officials involved in antidrug efforts 
secret service spokesman richard abrams would neither confirm 
nor deny that protection for the bush family was increased 
security is always tight as you know abrams said 
initially the bush children had resisted extra security but all 
finally agreed to an increased secret service presence newsday 
reported 
adding fuel to speculation of colombian hit squads was the 
arrest in new brunswick canada earlier this month of five men 
with an arsenal of weapons venezuelan papers and links with 
colombian suspects in a drugtrafficking case 
canadian officials said there was a link between the arrested 
men and a hearing for two colombians suspected of cocaine 
trafficking although they denied that any us or canadian 
official was in danger 
however the men were carrying maps of new brunswick and 
neighboring maine where bushs daughter lives and where he has a 
family vacation home in kennebunkport 
police said several locations were highlighted on the maps but 
refused to say what they were

portauprince haiti ap almost all businesses were closed 
and public transportation was halted wednesday in a nationwide 
strike called to protest the military governments austerity 
measures 
the hugely successful 24hour strike was called by 32 different 
groups representing farmers workers opposition parties and 
others lt gen prosper avril the military ruler had predicted 
the strike would fail 
police offered free rides in government trucks but unlike 
during previous strikes there were no long lines of residents 
waiting for them 
the normally crowded and bustling downtown sidewalks were empty 
as all street vendors stayed home the outdoor market also was 
empty in the wealthy suburb of petionville which usually does not 
heed strike calls 
almost all factories at the industrial park on the north side of 
this city of 1 million were closed 
the strike was called to protest last months austerity 
measures which include an increase in tariffs on imports and a 
lowering of the ceiling on taxable businesses to include those that 
earn as little as 25000 a year other measures included a price 
hike for some staple foods 
avrils government said the measures would allow haiti one of 
the worlds poorest nations to qualify for aid from several 
lending institutions including a 265 million loan from the 
international monetary fund 
the strike was one of the most successful since dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in france in february 1986 
unions as well as management appeared to back it in previous 
strikes factory owners kept plants open for any employee who 
wanted to work 
for the first time since duvaliers departure everybody has 
unanimously rejected the socioeconomic policy of the government 
opposition leader hubert de ronceray told the associated press 
the strike shut down all provincial towns though in the north 
coast city of cap haitien a few businesses opened radio stations 
said 
the government has decreed tax measures in an underhanded 
dictatorial way harmful to the majority of the people said 
jeanclaude roy head of the union of haitian constitutionalists 
party 
the groups backing the strike included haitis biggest union 
the autonomous central of haitian workers the communist party the 
centerleftist congress of democratic movements party and the 
papaye peasants movement the largest farmers group in haiti 
the chamber of commerce and the haitian association of 
industrialists have strongly criticized the austerity measures 
saying they will cause a social explosion though they did not 
formally back the strike they appeared to tacitly support it since 
virtually all businesses and factories were closed 
avril told the associated press on monday the strike would fail 
he came to power in a soldiers coup in september 1988 ousting lt 
gen henri namphy who assumed power when duvalier left

during three months of treatment 22 of 37 patients given 
cyclosporine showed improvement compared with 11 of 34 of those 
who took placebos during a threemonth followup the improvement 
continued to 38 percent of the cyclosporine patients and 15 percent

the researchers said their results were rather encouraging 
but they said more study is needed and this treatment should be 
limited for now to formal research experiments

a tin roof and the roof started ripping off the house the house

the use of ghetto shooting galleries to share 
needles may help explain why aids infections are more common among 
black and hispanic drug addicts than among white users a study 
concludes 
the study conducted in a methadone treatment program in new 
york city found that use of shooting galleries was the single most 
important difference between those who got infected and those who 
did not 
blacks and hispanics were more likely than whites to go to 
shooting galleries places where drug abusers buy or rent needles 
to inject drugs 
it is clear that the social milieu in which drugs are 
injected not just the number of injections is a powerful 
predictor of the transmission of hiv the aids virus the 
researchers wrote 
the study was conducted by dr ellie e schoenbaum and 
colleagues at montefiore medical center in the bronx it was 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
among the 452 people who took part in the study the aids 
infection rate was 49 percent in blacks 42 percent in hispanics 
and 17 percent in nonhispanic whites 
while the blacks and hispanics were more likely to frequent 
shooting galleries the whites were more apt to share needles with 
friends and relatives 
shooting galleries are particularly well suited for the 
transmission of hiv since used needles are usually rented and then 
reused by strangers or acquaintances they wrote in our study 
drug users who shared needles with strangers or acquaintances were 
at high risk for hiv infection whereas those who shared with close 
friends or relatives were at lower risk 
twothirds of those took more than 25 percent of their drug 
injections in shooting galleries were infected compared with less 
than onethird of those who never went there 
the study also found that the risk of aids infection increased 
by 24 percent with each sex partner who used intravenous drugs

parliament on wednesday adopted a law 
giving people the right to express opinions or advocate political 
and social change further expanding freedom of speech before 
multiparty elections next year 
the bill and a related amendment of the criminal procedure law 
are part of a package of legislation designed to bring hungarys 
laws in line with moves toward a pluralistic system and with 
international covenants on human rights 
under the penal code amendment which takes effect immediately 
expressing ones private opinion or advocating political or social 
change can no longer be considered crimes 
hungarys rapid liberalization has allowed a degree of free 
expression that would have been difficult even one year ago 
opposition leaders can have their say in the official media and in 
most cases people are permitted to demonstrate freely on a wide 
range of issues including such sensitive topics as the withdrawal 
of soviet troops 
the draft legislation before parliament must create the legal 
preconditions for the transition leading to a new constitutional 
order and eliminate obstacles in the path of the transformation 
to a multiparty system justice minister kalman kulcsar said 
the penal code amendment was designed only to deal with urgent 
matters and a comprehensive penal code reform is under way 
kulcsar said 
jozsef debreczeni one of four new members of parliament who 
belong to the opposition and received the majority vote in recent 
byelections the first in which hungarians had a genuine choice 
of candidates under communist rule said a reformed penal code is 
needed immediately 
under the current legislation he said the new opposition 
parties could be legally charged with conspiracy to overthrow the 
established constitutional order 
parliament is drafting a new constitution that is to ensure 
separation of powers guarantee human rights and remove all 
references to a oneparty state but it is not to be formally 
adopted until after elections due by june when the new parliament 
has begun work 
hungarys communist party has agreed to relinquish its leading 
role and to enter into free elections with independent parties 
even pledging to go into opposition if it loses 
on tuesday parliament adopted new emigration and travel laws 
that will allow unprecedented freedom of movement to hungarians and 
allow those who emigrated for personal or even for political 
reasons to return home if they wish

defense secretary dick cheney releasing the 
pentagons annual assessment of soviet military might said 
wednesday that congress should not impose spending cuts in 
anticipation of a kinder gentler soviet union 
the secretary warned that the soviet union continues to 
modernize its armed forces and will remain the worlds largest 
military power even if soviet president mikhail gorbachev makes 
good on his promised cutbacks and pledges of reform 
in sum we now find a soviet union which retains enormous 
military power the only nation still capable of threatening the 
very survival of the united states cheney said at a pentagon 
briefing prudence therefore dictates that we maintain our 
defenses while we wait and see about soviet developments 
cheney issued the report soviet military power as congress 
debates pentagon spending cuts 
the senate on tuesday voted to trim president bushs star wars 
program by 800 million a move that could spell the first annual 
budget reduction in the spacebased antimissile shield 
congress seems determined to want to take cuts in the defense 
budget in anticipation of a kinder gentler soviet union cheney 
complained during his meeting with reporters 
the secretary said that in the midst of all the hope and 
optimism about prospects for arms accords and a less threatening 
international environment americans must remember the united 
states faces a more formidable offensive strategic arsenal than 
when gorbachev came to power 
he said congress should go along with the presidents requests 
for star wars the b2 stealth bomber the submarinelaunched 
trident missile and a mobile missile force in order to counter 
soviet improvements 
at the white house bush said cheneys message was good 
advice for both the administration and congress 
hes saying dont do something dumb dont make the mistake of 
unilaterally disarming knocking out significant strategic 
modernization programs at the very minute that the soviet union is 
going forward bush said in an oval office exchange with 
reporters 
the annual study which in its early editions under the reagan 
administration was derided on capitol hill and outside government 
as an overblown estimate of the soviet militarys effectiveness 
has evolved amid the changing ussoviet relationship 
now sprinkled among its 159 pages are a photo of gorbachev 
garnering support for his reforms at a communist party conference 
a picture of ethnic demonstrations in a baltic republic and a 
snapshot showing adm william crowe jr and soviet military leader 
gen sergei akhromeyev reviewing troops at the pentagon 
whereas previous volumes made references to soviet intentions of 
world domination the new volume notes that the likelihood for 
conflict between the superpowers is as low as it has been at any 
time in the postwar era 
but it also portrays the soviets as an extremely formidable foe 
facing a united states that grapples with such things as the 
selection of a mobile missile force 
cheney insisted that the first version of the publication to be 
issued on his watch was an attempt to be fair and accurate about 
the threat the united states faces 
my point here today is not to in any way be critical of the 
reforms efforts we see mr gorbachev undertaking cheney said 
adding that the pentagon has been extremely supportive of the 
move to engage the soviets in the arms control arena 
cheney called the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan a 
significant development it is pictured on the cover of the 
report 
the report also cites gorbachevs announcement of significant 
cuts in conventional forces reductions in the soviet defense 
budget and weapons procurement and the ussoviet arms control 
agreement on banning intermediaterange missiles in europe 
cheney said hed like to see gorbachevs announced intentions 
enacted as well as continued ussoviet efforts to reduce 
conventional arms in europe reach a treaty on strategic nuclear 
weapons and increase militarytomilitary exchanges 
the secretary announced that next week he intends to play host 
to soviet defense minister gen dmitri yazov during a weeklong 
visit to the united states 
among other soviet military developments he cited 
despite gorbachevs announced 142 percent reduction in soviet 
defense spending outlays since 1985 have increased by an average 
of 3 percent a year in real terms 
the soviets are deploying a new silobased ss18 
intercontinental ballistic missile with 10 warheads each while they 
continue to field 170 ss25 roadmobile missiles and some 18 
railmobile ss18s 
the soviets have augmented their strategic ballistic missile 
submarine force by launching the sixth units of the typhoon and 
delta ivclass submarines 
while the soviets are unilaterally withdrawing some ground 
forces opposite nato they are reorganizing and modernizing their 
general purpose forces upgrading their communications networks and 
researching future generations of weapons systems 
even though a significant trend was sighted of lessened 
soviet naval operations in waters far from the homeland new major 
surface combat ships were added to the fleet

runway wednesday after its takeoff was aborted because of suddenly 
shifting winds airline officials said no serious injuries were 
reported 
the ati airline jet carrying 102 people was taking off from 
palermos punta raisi airport for a flight to milan when it 
experienced the condition known as wind shear said airport 
director ignazio bonaccorsio 
as a consequence the airplane while maintaining power lost 
speed and altitude retouching the ground at this point action of 
the flight crew was masterful even on a runway drenched with rain 
they did not lose control of the aircraft he said 
wind shear is a dangerous downdraft associated with severe 
thunderstorms that has been known to cause aircraft accidents 
airline officials said a man with a heart condition was 
hospitalized for observation as a precaution and a women was 
treated for a cut caused by a beverage cart that broke loose during 
the landing

pilot aborted the takeoff at about 330 pm an airline official 
said 
the company issued a statement that did not mention wind shear 
it said only that the pilot made the decision to abort because of a 
sudden change in the weather and because he still had time to abort 
the takeoff safely 
the aircraft suffered no apparent damage when it touched down on 
the runway and rolled off

the senate voted overwhelmingly for a 
bipartisan 94 billion antidrug package today with leaders of 
both parties saying their two weeks of contentious bargaining had 
produced an effective and needed plan 
this is the first step sen robert byrd dwva his 
partys chief negotiator during the justconcluded talks said 
before the 972 vote weak shots across the bow will not cripple 
the garbage scow of drug violence and drug dependency 
sen mark hatfield rore who led the gop negotiating team 
during the bargaining that began sept 15 said the package 
addresses a problem that is being battled in every congressional 
district 
the troops are out there said hatfield all theyre 
waiting for is the orders a plan of attack and theyre ready to 
march 
agreement on the proposal nailed down thursday night ended a 
fight between the two parties that had blocked senate passage of 
spending bills for the new fiscal year that begins sunday 
its eye on the calendar the senate passed two spending measures 
for fiscal 1990 late tuesday a 144 billion foreign aid package 
and a 1574 billion measure for labor health and education 
programs 
but with congressional leaders convinced lawmakers will never 
finish all 13 annual appropriations bills by the oct 1 start of 
the new federal budget year the house adopted legislation keeping 
government agencies operating through oct 25 
we have no alternative complained the ranking republican on 
the house appropriations committee rep silvio conte of 
massachusetts 
the senate action came after republicans lifted the roadblock 
they threw two weeks ago in front of spending measures while they 
and democrats searched for a compromise on a broad package of 
antidrug programs 
when a deal among democrats republicans and the white house for 
a beefedup drug plan was announced the senates legislative 
logjam dissolved and things moved quickly 
senators voted 8911 to adopt the foreign aid bill boosting 
assistance to the new noncommmunist government of poland to 45 
million president bush has sought 35 milion less for the first 
annual installment of a threeyear commitment he detailed at 119 
million exclusive of 100 million in food aid handled in a 
separate bill 
the measure also brings us military aid to el salvador to 90 
million a 5 million addition to this years total 
lawmakers also adopted by 8119 a 1574 billion measure for 
labor health and education programs that includes slightly relaxed 
abortion restrictions the measure expands the medicaid program for 
the poor to pay for abortions to women made pregnant by rape or 
incest currently only mothers whose lives are threatened qualify 
for assistance 
housesenate negotiators must now write compromise versions of 
both measures before offering them to bush for his signature so 
far only one of the 13 annual spending bills has been sent to the 
white house 
senate passage of a 672 billion package for veterans housing 
and space programs was delayed while lawmakers weighed adding aid 
for victims of last weeks hurricane hugo 
also held up was final approval of an 119 billion 
transportation measure the antidrug package was to be inserted 
into that bill before its passage 
senate leaders said that when added to the 79 billion bush has 
already proposed the new antidrug package will bring next years 
spending on the drug problem to 94 billion some 600 million of 
the total however had previously been proposed by congress 
of the remaining 900 million senators agreed to seek 100 
million would be for law enforcement and the rest for treatment 
education and rehabilitation 
overall the package would tack nearly 32 billion to the 
governments 57 billion antidrug effort this year 
the extra spending would come from a 043 percent cut on federal 
spending with social security and other benefit programs exempted 
final agreement on the antidrug package came when the senates 
democratic leaders agreed to let the chamber consider a republican 
anticrime package later this year 
the measure will contain many of the elements of a measure bush 
proposed in june including such items as widening the application 
of the death penalty limiting appeals by some prisoners and making 
it easier for police to obtain evidence

a lebanese man serving a life sentence for the 
attempted assassination of a former iranian prime minister said 
wednesday he would pay damages to the victims of his attack in 
exchange for his release from prison 
in a statement issued by his lawyers anis naccache said his 
proposal would improve franceiranian relations there was no 
immediate response from the french government to the proposal 
the lawyers jacques verges and antoine comte also told 
reporters that their client had nothing to do with last weeks 
crash of a french airliner en route from ndjamena chad to paris 
there has been speculation that the uta flight on which 171 
people died could have been bombed in an effort to press for 
naccaches release 
iranian officials have called publicly for naccache to be freed 
but france has denied widespread reports that it agreed last year 
to free him as part of a deal for the release of the remaining us 
hostages in iran 
naccache led a fiveman team that tried to kill shahpour 
bakhtiar the last iranian premier before the islamic revolution 
outside his paris exile home in 1980 bakhtiar was unhurt but a 
neighbor and a policeman were killed and three other people injured 
at his trial naccache said he was carrying out orders from 
irans islamic authorities 
naccaches statement also urged the release of the four others 
convicted in the attack 
comte said the precise amount naccache would pay those injured 
in the attack and relatives of those killed had not been set but 
would amount to several million francs one million francs is 
equivalent to about 160000 
asked where naccache could get the money comte said one can 
deduce that iran would help pay for his release

the government on wednesday 
dismissed as pure speculation a british tv report alleging west 
german investigators committed major blunders before the pan am 
bombing over scotland in december 
the british broadcasting corp current affairs program 
panorama earlier this week said one blunder allegedly made by 
the west germans was the release of the suspected bomb maker two 
months before the jet was blown up 
this report is pure speculation chief government 
spokesman hans klein told reporters in bonn 
another highranking government official said that nine months 
after pan am flight 103 blew up over lockerbie us british and 
west german investigators still have no clear knowledge about 
who was responsible for the bombing 
all 259 people aboard flight 103 from frankfurt to new york via 
london were killed in the dec 21 attack along with 11 people on 
the ground in lockerbie 
hans neusel the no 2 official in the interior ministry 
repeated west german doubts that the bomb had been loaded onto the 
flight in frankfurt 
there was no evidence on whether the bomb was placed aboard the 
plane in frankfurt or london and investigators remained in the dark 
about the kind of detonator used neusel said 
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio station neusel said 
west german investigators have found no links between members of a 
radical palestinian group arrested in west germany in october 1988 
and the pan am bombing two months later 
west german authorities arrested 16 suspected members of the 
syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command but quickly released 14 of them citing a lack of evidence 
among those released was a jordanian marwan khreesat the 
panorama program said khreesat is a known bomb maker and is 
widely believed by british and us investigators to have made the 
lockerbie bomb and several others 
the program said khreesat was in hiding in jordan and that the 
west germans apparently released him because he was a double agent 
who was also working for jordanian intelligence 
two of those seized in october remain in custody on other 
bombing charges including hafez kassem dalkamoni a top aide to 
pflpgc leader ahmed jabril 
in a us television interview in april jabril denied that his 
group had any role in the pan am bombing but he said dalkamoni 
often built and used the type of bomb that blew up flight 103 
the bbc program said that investigators were convinced that 
pflpgc masterminded the attack the group has long been the prime 
suspect 
in a statement distributed in britain and bonn lord fraser 
chief legal officer of scotland said he found the panorama 
program extremely interesting and clearly it was the product of 
considerable work 
lord fraser said his legal position prevented him from 
commenting on any specific allegations

to a halt in midtown manhattan 
in an attempt to list the 10 most congested roads in the 
metropolitan area the club said wednesday that every street 
between 34th and 59th streets in manhattan should qualify as a 
motorists nightmare and lumped them together as one 
it blamed double parking heavy pedestrian volume lack of 
traffic signal coordination and lack of offstreet parking and 
loading zones for stifling congestion virtually any day any 
time 
one other of the nine roads winning the dubious gridlock honors 
was in manhattan chambers street a main crosstown route from the

boot camp veterans may think of drill 
sergeants as people who cause rather than suffer anxiety but the 
army is planning stress management programs for the sergeants and 
for their wives 
the training already has been implemented at fort sill okla 
and fort leonard wood mo 
the program will highlight pressures facing drill sergeants and 
offer ways to deal with that stress said sgt maj william mayo of 
fort bennings infantry training center command and it is designed 
to show the sergeants wives what their husbands go through he 
said 
the 13week program to be offered every four months will 
give the drill sergeants a release to talk about their anxiety 
mayo said the wives too because they spend a lot of time 
alone the husband can see what the wives are going through and 
maybe we can provide a better understanding of whats really on the 
mind of soldiers and their wives 
he said drill sergeants work 14 hours a day during a twoyear 
tour and the wives seldom see their husbands during that time mayo 
said studies have shown that drill sergeants experience the most 
stress during the first nine to 12 months of their duty tour

although more physicians are being disciplined 
by state regulators lax treatment of negligence still poses a 
serious risk to public health a health research group said 
wednesday 
state licensing boards took serious disciplinary actions 
license revocation suspension or probation against 1495 
physicians in 1987 a 17 percent increase over the previous year 
said a public citizen health research group report 
nationally thats a rate of nearly three serious actions for 
every 1000 doctors 
but some states continue to be more vigilant than others in 
weeding out bad doctors and in some states physicians can still 
operate drunk commit a gross act of negligence or sexually 
assault a patient and receive a mere slap on the wrist the 
report said 
the numbers are based on actions reported by the federation of 
state medical boards whose executive vice president bryant 
galusha agreed that the number of actions has been increasing but 
said the public citizen report does not present a full picture 
galusha said the group failed to tally the 1106 remedial 
actions state boards took in 1987 by which physicians are allowed 
to continue practicing with certain limitations also not all 
actions taken are disciplinary in nature such as when a board 
denies a license he said 
these protect the public too galusha said 
public citizen estimates that more than 100000 americans are 
injured or killed each year because of physicians negligence and 
that lax treatment of physicians negligence is one of the most 
serious threats to the health of american patients 
the public interest group associated with ralph nader said 
serious disciplinary actions against physicians have more than 
doubled since 1984 and attributes the rise to a spate of adverse 
publicity and state and federal legislation 
during 1987 and 1988 44 state legislatures strengthened state 
oversight of physicians the group said 
also the federations physician disciplinary data bank a 
computerized network linking all the state boards has made it 
easier for states to keep track of errant doctors galusha said 
were hardly ever seeing a physician once theres an action 
taken against him pack his bag and go to another state without 
being detected its very difficult for that to happen now whereas 
five years ago it was done with relative ease galusha said 
the most common charge against doctors leading to a serious 
disciplinary action is incompetence said sidney wolfe a physician 
and head of the health research group other charges include 
writing an excessive number of prescriptions for controlled 
substances and personally abusing drugs he said 
the group recommends raising doctors licensing fees to 500 per 
year to finance doctor disciplinary actions and reduce the backlogs 
that plague many state medical boards 
public citizen also recommends periodic recertification of 
physicians giving state boards broader authority to evaluate 
doctors and take action against them and requiring insurance 
companies to rate doctors so those with the best records pay the 
lowest premiums

palestinian activists have begun returning 
israeli identity cards they had seized from gaza strip arabs who 
needed the cards to travel to israel arab sources said wednesday 
the return of the cards is a victory for israels tighter 
security measures to control the uprising in the occupied lands 
the cards apparently were returned because of the economic hardship 
their seizure caused palestinians who have jobs in israel 
israel began issuing the magnetic cards in june and by 
midaugust all gaza men were required to have a card to enter 
israel as a security precaution 
the issuing of the cars and the boycott of them declared by the 
uprising leaders severely curtailed the entry into israel of arabs 
who live in the gaza strip but work in israel about 50000 gazans 
worked regularly in israel 
fayez abu rahme a prominent gaza lawyer acknowledged that the 
leaders of the 21monthold uprising against israeli rule in the 
occuped lands had failed to pressure israel to halt the magnetic 
card project 
taking the cards from workers means imposing unemployment 
they have no alternative there are no jobs available in the gaza 
strip abu rahme told the associated press 
denying them the magnetic cards means they have to starve 
he said 
the israeli daily yediot ahronot reported wednesday that workers 
in gaza had banded together to resist by force the masked gangs who 
were confiscating the cards 
the gangs hacked to death at least one palestinian who refused 
to hand over his card and threatened hundreds of others 
according to yediot the gangs confiscated 10000 magnetic cards 
since june about 60000 have been issued 
arab sources said the activists stopped confiscating the cards 
two weeks ago and have since allowed gazans to leave freely for 
jobs in israel 
the authorities have won the battle over the magnetic cards 
one palestinian journalist said 
also wednesday an israeli human rights organization the israel 
information center for human rights in the occupied territories 
criticized the armys policy of demolishing the homes of

at least 5000 people arrived in a remote 
central indian village wednesday to protest a dambuilding project 
that environmentalists say will displace about 1 million people 
archaeologists say some of the countrys richest prehistoric 
sites and oldest fossils also will end up under water when four 
dams are built on river narmada 
the save narmada committee is battling the government to stop 
the project it staged the twoday protest 
we expect thousands more to come from all parts of the country 
thursday said group spokesman vinod raina 
the narmada river originates in madhya pradesh state and flows 
through maharastra and gujarat states before emptying into the 
indian ocean 
raina said about 5000 people arrived wednesday for the protest 
in harsud about 150 miles from bhopal capital of madhya pradesh 
state he said the protesters should number 50000 by thursday 
in addition to the four major dams the government plans to 
build about 3000 smaller ones on the river and its 41 tributaries 
environmentalists working with the save narmada committee say 
the project will flood 864500 acres of forest and 494000 acres of 
cultivated land as a result more than a million people will be 
displaced they say 
the government says the project is essential because it will 
irrigate vast tracts of land in the three states generate 
electricity and solve the drinking water problem in neighboring 
gujarat state which often suffers from drought 
it also has said it will provide land for people who are 
displaced by the flooding 
but why should we leave our village and the soil where we were 
born said nagin chand misrilal a trader in harsud one of 573 
villages that will be under water when the dams are completed 
the trouble with people today is that they think the society 
is only of human beings and nature is a commodity he said 
raina said the protesters will form a human chain in the area 
it will be symbolic in that we will not let the government 
destroy our land he said 
over the years archaeological teams have found hundreds of 
fossils of extinct animals and ancient stoneage implements 
fashioned by prehistoric humans 
among the activists expected in harsud were sunder lal bahuguna 
who led a successful campaign against tree cutters in northern 
india by urging activists to hug trees to stop cutters

a city council candidate who landed in 
jail because of unrequited love believes he can win over voters 
from his cell even if he couldnt woo his girlfriend back with his 
aerial antics 
mark roddam was free on 5000 bond on a burglary charge filed 
by his girlfriend and under court order not to see her when he 
rented a small airplane sept 9 and flew it over the birmingham 
race course where the woman works 
jefferson county judge robert cahill didnt take kindly to 
roddams ignoring his order and put the candidate under a 500000

rendering a false alarm and wreckless operation of an aircraft

for roddam on oct 18 roddam 33 is trying to unseat bill myers 
59 a veteran council member and former birmingham police chief 
the election is oct 10 
i do have a chance to win roddam said this week but with 
me in here it kind of puts a damper on things 
although the felony count carries the most serious penalty up 
to 20 years in jail it was the aircraft misdemeanor that landed 
roddam behind bars 
roddam said he wasnt flying exceptionally low but news cameras 
captured the plane buzzing the race course 
then the judge got mad at me for breaking the order of not 
going near her and he gave me the half a million bond i couldnt 
pay that so here i am in jail roddam said 
the federal aviation administration also revoked roddams flying 
license roddam who is a usedcar salesman said he believes he 
can win because he has name recognition 
ill do a better job than bill myers ever did roddam said 
i know ive got a better personality and its obvious im better 
looking and im a whole lot younger

soviet physicist andrei sakharov the 1975 
nobel peace prize winner said wednesday that a very big part of 
soviet territory is an environmental catastrophe area 
sakharov an activist once held in the soviet closed city of 
gorky made his comments during ceremonies at claude bernard 
university where he was awarded an honorary doctorate 
the soviet academician 68 said the catastrophe has never 
happened anywhere else as it has in the soviet union adding that 
it is the heritage of stalinism 
over the past several years a number of soviet officials and 
newspaper reports have outlined significant problems of air water 
and soil pollution experts also cite radiation and health problems 
stemming from the 1986 disaster at the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant in the soviet ukraine 
fyodor morgun head of the state committee for the protection of 
nature has said that pollution levels in 102 soviet cities 
affecting more than 50 million people are often 10 times higher 
than soviet laws permit 
according to un estimates the soviet union is the worlds 
leading source of sulpher dioxide and the soviet political 
journal novymir reported the bed of the neva river in leningrad 
has oil sludge in some areas 25 feet deep and pesticide use in the

gulf state lawmakers trying to convince the 
white house to abandon regulations that require shrimpers to equip 
their nets with trap doors were told wednesday to justify their 
request with scientific findings 
president bushs chief of staff john sununu said the shrimping 
industry should conduct the same kind of scientific studies as the 
government in exploring the relationship between shrimping and sea 
turtle deaths according to congressmen who met with sununu 
the commerce department earlier this month ordered shrimpers to 
resume using devices that keep endangered sea turtles from drowning 
in their nets 
under a congressional mandate to protect the turtles the 
department earlier had promulgated alternative regulations 
requiring lifting of the nets every 90 minutes or so to let turtles 
escape it abandoned those rules under a court challenge by 
environmental groups 
environmentalists argue the timing limits let too many turtles 
die and the trapdoor mechanisms turtle excluder devices or 
teds are by far the best way to protect turtles 
gulf shrimpers say the devices can be dangerous to use and 
reduce their catches by 10 percent to 30 percent the shrimping 
industry has not been unanimous on the issue atlantic fleets have 
generally adopted excluders and florida has made it mandatory for 
boats using state waters 
president bush has agreed to look into the longrunning dispute 
beginning oct 15 shrimpers in the gulf face fines for not 
using the devices said rep billy tauzin dla who attended 
wednesdays meeting with sununu 
tauzin said that with implementation of the fines less than 
three weeks away we have to move fast to give the white house 
the kind of studies sununu requested 
were obviously working with someone who has given what 
appears to be a great deal of time and attention to the issue and 
does want to find a workable solution tauzin said were not 
going to miss the opportunity to persue that 
rep solomon ortiz dtexas also at the meeting said in a 
statement that shrimpers are not the main culprit in the decline of 
the endangered sea turtles and many shrimpers are beginning to 
report accidents and near accidents caused by the use of teds

president bushs proposal to extend steel 
import restraints for 2 years was swiftly approved by a house 
panel wednesday as negotations continued with japan and other 
trading partners to carry out its provisions 
trade representatives from japan south korea the european 
community mexico venezuela and romania are all in washington this 
week for negotiations with the bush administration on new 
productbyproduct steel trade restrictions 
the old restraints which took effect in 1984 expire on 
saturday 
us trade representative carla hills expects to report on the 
progress of the talks in a statement on monday according to her 
spokeswoman christina mccown 
meanwhile the house ways and means committee approved on a 
voice vote a bill carrying out bushs program to extend the 
restrictions with 29 countries until march 31 1992 
the administration hopes that 2 years will be long enough to 
negotiate an end to foreign government subsidies on steel and other 
trade practices that the american industry considers unfair 
the earlier agreements were negotiated by the reagan 
administration in 1984 to give us steelmakers breathing space 
from foreign competition and allow them to modernize at the time 
american firms had been filing trade litigation charging overseas 
competitors with employing unfair subsidies and selling imported 
steel at less than fair market value 
the american industry had sought a full fiveyear extension but 
many steelusing manufacturers argued that the quotas had driven up 
prices and caused steel product shortages 
bushs plan announced july 25 was intended as a compromise 
the extension will allow some countries market shares to rise by 1 
percentage point per year until quotas are phased out entirely 
hills said the yearly increase will be allocated to countries that 
exhibit the most willingness to stop subsidizing their domestic 
industry 
the senate has not yet acted on the plan which must first be 
considered by its finance committee but even opponents who wanted 
a longer or shorter extension concede there is little they can do 
to stop the bush program now 
in 1984 the united states had particular difficulty negotiating 
an agreement with japan its largest steel trading partner japan 
finally agreed to cap its share of the american steel market at 58 
percent but not before complaining that it was being 
straitjacketed by us demands

attorney general richard thornburgh unveiled 
a plan wednesday to use 229 million seized from drug traffickers 
and organized crime rings for construction of more than 3000 
federal prison cells 
were now taking that money and turning it against those 
criminals from whom it was so justly taken talk about poetic 
justice this is that thornburgh said in a speech to us 
attorneys 
he described the money transfer to the federal bureau of prisons 
as a down payment on president bushs 15 billion proposed 
prison expansion 
justice department agencies have seized property worth more than 
1 billion since october 1988 and more than 500 million in 
forfeited and liquidated criminal property has been placed in the 
asset forfeiture fund thornburgh said 
of that money about 150 million was shared with local law 
enforcement agencies 
its i think satisfying to think that its now possible for 
a drug dealer to serve time in a forfeiturefinanced prison after 
being arrested by agents driving a forfeitureprovided automobile 
while working in a forfeiturefunded sting operation thornburgh 
said drawing applause from about 150 prosecutors 
recent changes in federal laws have helped in the seizure of 
criminals property thornburgh said the forfeiture fund has grown 
in yearly receipts from 272 million in 1985 to more than 500 
million this year according to justice department statistics 
thornburgh also said he will create an executive office for 
asset forfeiture to better coordinate the fund 
our focus as prosecutors has to be attacking these 
organizations where it hurts he said of drug traffickers 
theyre only in business for one purpose and thats to make 
money

the military commander of us strategic 
defenses citing the potential threat of military advances by the 
soviet union said wednesday the united states must forge ahead 
with its star wars space defense programs 
the statements by gen john piotrowski commanderinchief of 
the north american aerospace defense command known as norad comes 
a day after the senate voted down a measure to add 300 million to 
the star wars program formally called the strategic defense 
initiative 
we didnt develop those antisatellite spacecraft for war 
the general said adding that us programs are for early 
warning of a possible attack the soviet space weaponry however 
gives them the type of military capability one would like to 
have 
piotrowski made his remarks at a seminar sponsored by the 
american association for the advancement of science 
painting the us space programs as defensive and those by the 
soviets as offensive piotrowski made no mention of advances made 
by the superpowers last weekend during talks in wyoming the 
soviets pulled back an earlier demand to link longrange strategic 
arms talks on us curbs on the star wars program 
kent stansberry the defense departments director of defense 
and space arms policy said previously scheduled negotiations 
between the united states and the soviets will resume friday in 
geneva to work toward a stragegic arms reduction treaty an 
agreement would cut longrange strategic arms by up to 50 percent 
the soviet agreement not to link the treaty with limits on the 
us star wars program ended a fouryear deadlock 
stansberry cautioned however that the soviet union could try 
again to put conditions on future arms talks 
piotrowski said the united states was illprepared to deal with 
the soviets in the event they used weapons against american 
satellites 
would they shoot down a mechanical device in space that was a 
threat to security you bet they would the general said what 
would we do 
congress has banned antisatellite tests against objects in 
space earlier this year secretary of defense dick cheney called 
the lack of space testing for antisatellite weapons the single 
most vulnerable point in us defenses 
in recent years piotrowski said the united states detected and 
tracked about 1700 missiles launched by the soviets and other 
nations and needed the ability to track them to assure they did 
not pose a threat 
im convinced we need an antisatellite weapon to protect 
our troops and respond in kind the general said 
the star wars program and the antisatellite weapons have been 
sources of controversy for years president reagan first proposed 
the space programs in 1983 and his aides said the star wars 
defense shield would include several hundred large orbiting 
platforms equipped with killer rockets and hundreds of supporting 
surveillance and tracking satellites 
lawmakers have argued that some of the testing would violate the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty between the united states and 
the soviet union 
congress on tuesday voted down a republican effort to restore 
funds to star wars to a level closer to the 45 billion approved 
by the senate in its authorization bill last month

a woman who died of a heart attack in jail 
before she could be arraigned on a prostitution charge will be 
buried in a paupers grave because fairfax county authorities could 
not identify her 
the woman left a trail that included 38 aliases five social 
security numbers four claimed dates of birth and at least 28 
arrests for crimes from bank robbery to drug possession over 15 
years according to fbi files 
we will never know who she was said sheriff m wayne 
huggins we worked on it for two weeks but it became one of 
those situations where the more you looked the stranger it got 
it just makes me sad sad to look at this life and see what a 
tragedy it was huggins said 
her aliases included catherine ann kaine katherine ann caine 
candy caine for short when she was arrested aug 31 at a motel on 
a prostitution charge 
she died sept 5 before her arraignment 
police believe she was 34 but was emaciated worn and looked at 
least 50 when the tall blonde was arrested she had fresh needle 
marks on her arms from a drug habit police said 
the woman told police she was married but didnt leave behind 
any emergency telephone numbers 
there seemed to be a lot of information there but we just 
couldnt really find anyone who knew a lot about her huggins 
said 
the woman who was cremated will be buried by the county social 
services department in potters field the fairfax city cemetery 
huggins said 
during the investigation one man surfaced who claimed to have 
married her in a 10 ceremony in las vegas but investigators 
couldnt find any records and allege he was actually in the 
prostitution business with her 
another man said he was her brother but authorities doubted 
him that man said she was from roanoke but no leads were found 
there 
huggins last hope was in chicago where she was first arrested 
for prositution 15 years ago that was also a futile search

restructuring the nations 
educational system should begin with allowing parents to decide 
where to send their children to school education secretary lauro 
cavazos said wednesday 
cavazos in an interview shortly before the official opening of 
the nations first education summit said president bush and other 
administration officials would not pressure governors to support 
the concept of parental choice but would still recommend it 
i dont think that were going to be selling an idea to these 
governors cavazos said i think what we need to do is put an 
idea out and say this is a mechanism thats very very important 
ive called choice the cornerstone for restructuring 
while bush has been a staunch advocate of the idea making it 
the centerpiece of his education initiative cavazos initially was 
lukewarm he has since strongly endorsed it 
conservatives had hoped the administration would showcase the 
idea at the summit and try to get commitments from governors to 
support the concept in their states 
the most controversial form of school choice allows parents to 
send their children to schools outside the districts where they 
live so far this year arkansas iowa and nebraska have joined 
minnesota in calling for open enrollment options for their citizen 
minnesotas open enrollment plan went into effect the past 
school year 
shortly after the summit in midoctober cavazos is slated to 
begin a whirlwind choice tour that will take him to minnesota 
north carolina colorado and california his plans include daytime 
hearings and nighttime sessions with working parents 
were not really selling the program said cavazos we 
simply are taking it out there people are going to consider it 
as with most of the education programs being discussed at the 
summit finding money to implement choice programs may be a problem 
cavazos admitted theres no way in the world that we can fund 
that kind of program transportation costs are one of the most 
expensive aspects of the concept

south carolinas senators said wednesday they 
would try to win congressional approval this week for up to 11 
billion to aid residents of areas stricken by hurricane hugo 
sen fritz hollings dsc said he would seek 400 million for 
victims in south carolina north carolina puerto rico and the 
virgin islands sen strom thurmond rsc said he has asked for 
11 billion and has the support of hollings and sen jesse helms 
rnc 
hollings said the money would be requested as part of a 
continuing resolution aimed at keeping the government in business 
when the new government fiscal year begins sunday 
the house passed such a measure on tuesday in anticipation of 
the senate being unable to pass all the appropriations bills by the 
end of the week the senate now has the measure 
thurmond spokesman christopher simpson said the continuing 
resolution was the most likely vehicle for obtaining the money 
quickly 
thurmond said that the bush administration supports his request 
in a related matter hollings sharply criticized the federal 
emergency management agency for its response to the hugo emergency 
he said he was angered in particular about the failure of fema 
to order provide emergency generators immediately when hollings 
called acting administrator robert morris on saturday 
fema spokesman bill mcada said the agency has answered the 
states request for generators which was made this week he said 
the red cross national guard and statebased authorities make the 
first responses and the state governors must request fema 
intervention 
meanwhile the agriculture department said it has approved the 
emergency release of food to help residents in six south carolina 
counties 
deputy secretary jack c parnell said the food was approved for 
charleston berkeley sumter dorchester and georgetown counties 
and parts of orangeburg county 
food was issued to families in dorchester sumter and orangeburg 
counties tuesday he said the other three counties may wait for 
emergency food stamps rather than take food commodities 
parnell said south carolinas request tuesday for emergency food 
stamps for the hardest hit counties was approved immediately and 
that nearly 33 million worth of stamps are being sent for 
emergency distribution later this week when retail grocery stores 
are operating again 
south carolina officials estimated 100000 households in the 
state are in need of emergency food aid

rep kika de la garza dtexas said wednesday 
that new farm legislation will not be held up so trade negotiations 
can proceed in geneva or any other place 
in fact he said there will be a push for farm bill completion 
by next spring with or without a proposal from the bush 
administration 
de la garza chairman of the house agriculture committee 
reacted to recent comments by agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
who has indicated that only minor work might be necessary on 
current farm law until substantive progress is made in the uruguay 
round of talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the current law the food security act of 1985 will expire at 
the end of next year and congress is just getting started on a 
1990 bill 
much of the nuts and bolts of the legislation will bear directly 
or indirectly on gatt trade policies and whether the united states 
will be successful in its bid to scale back and eventually 
eliminate trade barriers and subsidies that distort agricultural 
trade 
yeutter said earlier this week in minneapolis minn that he 
expected only minor changes in the commodity portions of the 1985 
farm law and that major modification could come in 1991 after gatt 
negotiations are completed 
de la garza said it is the responsibility of congress to 
legislate and decide how long a farm law shall be in effect 
the congress will decide whether or not to accept or reject 
any agreement made by the administration in geneva or any other 
place he said in a statement 
we will cooperate to the extent possible with the 
administration but it is my firm intention to continue with our 
stated goal of concluding the most extensive set of farm bill 
hearings in history by the end of this calendar year de la garza 
added 
further he said it is my intention to begin the markup of a 
farm bill early in 1990 with or without a proposal by the bush 
administration 
yeutter has said he expects the administration will send its 
1990 farm bill to congress by the end of this year 
de la garza said it is his intention to have a fiveyear farm 
billl completed and on the presidents desk by the end of may

americans will drive 4 trillion miles in 2007 
about double the number they drove in 1987 a transportation trade 
group executive said wednesday 
a growing desire for mobility will account for most of the 
growth in traffic said francis b francois executive director of 
the american association of street highway and transportation 
officials 
americans drove 2 trillion miles in 1987 about triple what 
they drove in 1956 francois said this is not the 1950s where 
american families had one car which dad may or may not have driven 
to work because he took public transportation 
both government and commuters must accept new ways to pay for 
new roads and improvements to existing ones said francois and 
others at a news conference where they presented findings of a 
congestion study sponsored by the urban land institute 
the institute is a research group supported in part by real 
estate developers 
there is the prevailing sentiment in local government to 
approach the problem simplistically like if you stop development 
you will stop traffic growth that is clearly not the case 
northern virginia developer and study director james defrancia said 
even with no new real estate development in the suburbs traffic 
would increase the study argued 
in norrs has increased twice as fast as population defrancia said 
nationally the number of miles driven and the number of cars 
increased about 55 percent from 1969 to 1983 and the number of 
drivers rose 43 percent while the population increased only 14 
percent 
the institute recommended greater use of public transit and car 
pools as well as new financing to reduce road congestion 
the united states spent about 66 billion on its roads in 1987 
but should be spending at least 80 billion annually just to 
maintain old roads and build the most vital new ones francois said 
it should be 100 billion to really meet all the needs he 
said

senate agriculture committee chairman patrick 
leahy said wednesday we dont need a james watt clone as he 
opened confirmation hearings on president bushs nominee for 
assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and the 
environment 
i expressed serious reservations when the bush administration 
announced the nomination of mr james cason the vermont democrat 
said 
he said he delayed the hearings to give the committee time to 
review the questions that had been raised about cason who has been 
a highranking official at the interior department since 1982 
mr casons background and alleged actions while at the 
department of interior concern me leahy said 
he said cason 35 has no professional training in forest 
landuse stewardship or soil and water conservation which would be 
his responsibilities as assistant agriculture secretary 
the nominee also has been accused of advocating positions at the 
interior department that reduce the returns to taxpayers from our 
federal resources and undermine sound protection of the 
environment leahy said 
sen slade gorton rwash asked cason to compare himself to 
watt the former interior secretary whose prodevelopment policies 
were considered by environmentalists to be destructive to public 
lands 
cason said he and watt worked under the same mandate to provide 
public lands for multiple uses including private and public 
interests 
but he said i dont know jim watt that well 
in his opening statement leahy said we are at a time when a 
strong and heightened awareness of the environment is needed in the 
department of agriculture a spirit of cooperation among all 
interests has to prevail 
we do not need a james watt clone in this position 
cason whose parents were migrant farm workers graduated magna 
cum laude from pacific university in forest grove ore with a 
bachelors degree in business administration 
his was a world of hard work and hard living said sen mark 
hatfield rore in a special appearance before the committee 
though his remarks about cason were laudatory and he admonished 
the committee to separate fact from fiction when reviewing

the soviets ended decades of 
secrecy wednesday by opening the worlds busiest spaceport to 
foreign journalists and revealing one of the worst disasters of the 
space age the 1980 explosion of a vostok rocket during fueling 
that killed 50 people 
moscowbased correspondents were invited to this military 
facility set among birch forests and lakes 530 miles north of the 
soviet capital to observe backtoback launches of a soviet molniya 
television satellite and an east bloc research probe designed to 
reveal secrets of the ionosphere 
the officially sanctioned trip to the spaceport in northwestern 
russia whose existence was acknowledged by the soviets only five 
years ago was further proof of the increased candor in soviet 
society as well as the space establishments pursuit of foreign 
clients and funds 
this is a time of openness and we have to make everything 
known that was hidden before like how space has been mastered and 
what scientific results are being obtained said army lt gen 
ivan i oleinik the space centers commander also he said we 
need to learn how to count money 
to help their space program yield bigger commercial dividends 
the soviets are hunting for foreign partners in space in april 
the first commercial payload was launched at plesetsk for the 
french firm matra last month a west german consortiums 
experiment to grow protein crystals in orbit was launched 
the growing commercialization and resulting welcome given 
foreigners at plesetsk is something new in the history of the base 
founded in 1957 as a topsecret launch site for soviet military 
missiles that would be relatively near us targets on the other 
side of the north pole 
behind the electrified barbed wire fences and armed guards 186 
miles south of the white sea port of archangelsk lies what east and 
west agree is the worlds busiest space center 
in his respected annual report on the soviet space program 
nicolas johnson of teledyne brown engineering said that by 1987 
the number of launches into space from plesetsk had reached 1159 
more than all total us european japanese and chinese space 
launches combined 
oleinik interviewed on the launch pad minutes before blastoff 
of the fourstage soyuz booster rocket carrying the molniya put 
the number of launches at plesetsk at 1000 and someodd 
this is the worlds hardestworking spaceport the general 
added 
under the kremlins openness policy stunning revelations have 
been made about failures in the soviet space program including the 
1960 explosion of an icbm that killed the head of soviet missile 
forces field marshal mitrofan nedelin and 53 others at the famous 
soviet space center baikonur home of the countrys manned space 
program 
soviet space specialists however say there has been no public 
mention of accidents at plesetsk but a 30foothigh rocketshaped 
aluminum monument in the bases bedroom community of mirny honors 
the victims of two apparently previously unreported disasters 
on march 18 1980 a vostok rocket the same twostage booster 
used to send soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin into orbit in 1961 
exploded while being fueled on the launch pad fortyfive people 
mostly soviet army inductees in their late teens and early 20s 
were instantly burned to death said anatoly lapshin senior 
scientific collaborator in plesetsks commercial department 
five other men who suffered burns over as much as 90 percent of 
their bodies died after being hospitalized lapshin said 
the 45 killed instantly were buried under red granite tombstones 
next to the monument near the shore of lake plesetsk and their 
enameled portraits were affixed on two low concrete walls in front 
of a row of fir trees an eternal flame burns in memory of the 
heroes 
despite 4 years of the kremlins official openness policy 
nothing yet has been written by state media about one of the 
biggest tragedies and its victims lapshin said 
the 1980 explosion was not the only catastrophe at plesetsk 
lapshin said on june 23 1973 a cosmos booster rocket also 
erupted in flames while being fueled and nine technicians and 
soldiers were killed 
lapshin said that following the accidents government 
commissions met and enacted safer guidelines for the refueling of 
rockets 
oveikin said the accidents were tragedies but that human 
loss in the pursuit of progress was unavoidable 
when the first automobile was tested there were accidents 
too the twostar general said 
the molniya satellite designed to rebroadcast programs from 
state soviet television and provide radiotelephone service to 
siberia and the soviet far east shot skyward with an earsplitting 
roar atop the soyuz booster 
nine minutes after launch the 47yardhigh rocket powered by 
liquid oxygen and kerosene was reported in orbit to journalists 
watching from a site nearly two miles from the launch pad 
before dawn thursday technicians at plesetsk were scheduled to 
launch intercosmos24 an east bloc research satellite 
the spacecraft will carry a metal coil that will expand into a 
ring 20 yards in diameter once the satellite reaches its elliptical 
orbit up to 1500 miles above earths surface 
the ring will be powered by lowfrequency radio waves and will 
become an antenna stimulating the ionosphere much the way the sun 
does

us about our literary and scientific achievements great houses of 
government and monuments which witness the sacrifices that people 
have made to keep our country alive 
it just seemed to me that among those symbols should be 
there had to be something which said something about the 
future she said 
catalanos design was among 930 proposals 
rep george miller dcal introduced the national peace 
monument bill in march 1986 former president reagan signed the 
measure into law in june 1987 
of the estimated 6 million cost for the gardens more than 
300000 dollars has been raised so far ms ratcliff said 
according to the law the project must be completed by 1992 or 
the entire legislative process must be repeated 
the gardens will be composed of seven large leaf forms each of 
which will be bordered by paved pathways that will enable visitors 
to walk from leaf to leaf 
the curvilinear paths join where the leaves meet each other 
forming the spine of the olive branch circular planters will be 
placed between the leaves where their stem forms to create the 
main branch 
the leaf forms will consist of a variety of low ground covers 
extending about a foot high and will form a rich varied and 
intricate texture spreiregen said

professor to deputy prime minister of poland solidarity activist 
leszek balcerowicz was holding roundtheclock meetings wednesday 
with western leaders to find the means for his governments 
survival 
we face a great threat and to reduce the threat we see aid 
from foreign nations not as a substitute for our own efforts but as 
a condition that could reduce the risk and could ensure a 
reasonable degree of success balcerowicz said during a pause in 
his hectic schedule 
balcerowicz 42 the senior polish leader to visit washington 
since the solidarityled government came to power aug 24 holds 
the twin titles of deputy prime minister and finance minister 
making him the senior solidarity backer in the cabinet after prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
mazowiecki heads the first noncommunist government in the 
soviet bloc 
balcerowicz may have been chosen not only because of his loyalty 
to solidarity and knowledge of economics but because of his past 
affiliation with the united states 
he speaks english with an american accent he picked up along 
with a masters degree in business administration from st johns 
university in queens new york he earned a doctorate at the warsaw 
main school of planning and social statistics where he taught 
until this summer 
balcerowicz supported the independent solidarity trade union 
during its 198081 legal existence after the martial law crackdown 
against the union dec 13 1981 he quit the polish united workers 
party the communist party 
visiting washington for a session of the 152nation 
international monetary fund balcerowicz has met with the finance 
ministers of six of the seven major western industrialized nations 
including us treasury secretary nicholas brady 
poland wants at least 15 billion over the next few months to 
ensure a steady supply of essential goods and to stabilize the 
faltering polish currency he said 
there are no good precedents for what we have to do 
balcerowicz said at a news conference 
we had quite numerous and quite productive meetings at least 
in terms of numbers the atmosphere was warm and i would hope 
results would be forthcoming quite quickly 
earlier wednesday president bush told the imf that we must do 
more to help poland urging the international lending 
organization and its sister agency the world bank to help poland 
restructure its economy 
balcerowicz said he welcomed both bushs comments and approval 
by the european economic community of a 660 million aid package 
for poland and hungary which is also moving quickly on the path of 
democratic reforms 
balcerowicz said he had heard about 100 ideas for the west 
to aid poland and that he would welcome the idea of forming polish 
and western groups to coordinate the aid program 
i would see the need for coordination on the western side and 
we are taking coordinating measures on our side he said

hundreds of east germans ignored 
spreading illness and pouring rain wednesday as they crowded into 
the west german embassy compound to press their demands to emigrate 
to the west 
i leave here only to the west or in a coffin said one woman 
newcomers scaled the fence of the embassy garden and refugees 
told reporters that about 1500 were inside the embassy compound 
the east german government tuesday offered them guaranteed 
emigration with impunity within six months if they would return 
home but only 177 people accepted the offer 
the east germans are hoping they will have the same luck as 
hundreds of east germans who crowded the west german embassy in 
budapest hungary in hopes of winning permission to leave their 
hardline communist homeland the refugees had been drawn to 
hungary since may when the reformist nation began dismantling its 
barriers along the western border 
in west germany border officials said more than 500 east 
germans arrived overnight from hungary via austria since hungary 
decided on sept 10 to allow east germans free passage to the west 
more than 22000 refugees have arrived in west germany where they 
are given automatic citizenship 
west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher arranged to 
meet east german foreign minister oskar fischer at the united 
nations in new york on wednesday night with the refugee situation 
high on their agenda 
genscher told the un general assembly on wednesday that 
reforms in east germany would open new prospects and encourage 
people to stay there 
hundreds of beds were made available wednesday to accommodate 
the swelling crowd in the prague embassy conditions were 
deteriorating for the east germans housed mainly in red cross 
tents 
several of the more than 250 children were said to have fallen 
ill with diarrhea and colds following heavy rain that began during 
the night the embassy was dubbed leipziger hof or hotel by 
the refugees after the east german city of leipzig 
we are humans not animals arent we they cannot let us rot 
away here can they a man told a western reporter talking to him 
through the fence 
some refugees said the crowd included many people with criminal 
records who were not trying to emigrate for political reasons 
the czechoslovak communist party newspaper rude pravo said 
providing the wouldbe emigrants with food and accommodations was 
getting more difficult 
it said the situation could be resolved only through discussions 
between east and west germany east germany has responded harshly 
to hungarys decision to let the east germans leave 
the refugees in prague said they were given three days to accept 
the offer by wolfgang vogel an east german lawyer who is acting as 
a negotiator for the east german government 
vogel left prague for warsaw wednesday to discuss the fate of 
about 400 east german refugees in the west german embassy in the 
polish capital 
he is expected to meet with walter priesnitz and juergen 
sudhoff two west german foreign ministry officials who negotiated 
with vogel in prague 
vogel is expected to make a similar offer to east german 
refugees in poland as he did to those in prague 
negotiations are on the right path for resolving the fate of 
the east german refugees in warsaw stefan staniszewski a 
spokesman for the polish foreign ministry said wednesday 
both german countries seem to be approaching an agreement 
that would take into account the standpoints of the interested 
sides as well as a humane approach to the matter staniszewski 
told a news conference 
he would not elaborate on the course of the negotiations except 
to say the solution of this difficult question is on the right 
path

the state department has approved visa 
applications for at least two palestine liberation organization 
officials to attend the un general assembly session in new york 
it was announced wednesday 
there had been speculation that the administration might approve 
a visa for plo chairman yasser arafat in light of the improved 
usplo relationship but state department spokesman richard 
boucher said arafat did not apply 
officials declined to say whether us and plo representatives 
had discussed the possibility of a visa request by arafat the 
state department has declined comment on how it would respond to a 
such a request but congressional sentiment was strongly opposed to 
granting arafat entry 
one of the visas was for adb rabbuh head of a plo delegation 
that has been holding periodic talks since december in tunis with 
us ambassador robert pelletreau 
rabbuh who attended the general assembly session last year is 
second in command of the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine 
the second visa was authorized for suliman najab a member of 
the plo executive committee and of the palestine communist party 
boucher indicated that the visa authorizations were a routine 
matter 
weve authorized these visas for a number of years consistent 
with our international legal obligations as host country to the 
un and following a full legal review of the application he 
said 
bouchers comments left open the possibility that other plo 
officials may accompany rabbuh and najab to new york the visas 
restrict the travel of the plo representatives to a 25mile radius 
of new york city 
the visas were issued solely to enable the palestinians to take 
part in unrelated activity they are expected to leave the 
united states when the general assembly adjourns in december 
on tuesday 68 senators urged the bush administration to deny 
any visa request from arafat contending that he has not lived up 
to promises made in december to renounce terrorism and recognize 
israels right to exist 
the plo is on a collision course with the peace process 
arafat and the plo must reaffirm and implement in deed and in 
word the statements of just nine months ago the senators said 
after arafat made those statements the united states abandoned 
its opposition to direct talks with plo officials four formal 
meetings have been held since then the last of which was in july

teacher unions were not invited to 
the twoday education summit that opened wednesday between 
president bush and the nations governors in fact no education 
groups were 
but leaders and staff of the national education association and 
the american federation of teachers were nonetheless very much in 
evidence here determined to play a behindthescenes role at the 
historic gathering that could determine the future directionn of 
school reform 
keith geiger president of the 2 millionmember nea spent 
wednesday meeting with govs booth gardner of washington james 
blanchard of michigan and garrey carruthers of new mexico pressing 
the unions agenda that includes increased funding for federal 
programs geiger said he planned to meet with about 10 governors 
before the meeting adjourned thursday 
albert shanker president of the 710000member aft said he 
planned to arrive at the summit thursday with about 10 other union 
officials 
essentially were going in order to be in a central position 
to comment said shanker reached by telephone in washington 
both shanker and geiger denied any anger or bitterness at not 
being invited 
when the education summit was first discussed we wondered how 
in the world you could have it without groups like the nea and 
other educational organizations but its now a moot point had it 
been opened up to a select group of organizations and if we 
werent among them then wed have been upset geiger said 
but as it turned out the summit consists of a very defined 
group of people on that basis were comfortable he said 
i was invited to the white house before the summit and we 
spent considerable time talking with governors said shanker who 
added that he took no offense at not being invited to the summit 
its a big country he said there are 16000 school 
boards and many other constituencies you have to draw the line 
somewhere 
the three top officers of the nea and six staff members were on 
the scene many of them in the press area in the university of 
virginia gymnasium with somewhere around 1000 reporters here 
we wanted them to have the neas perspective geiger said

consumer advocates and insurers who have 
clashed in the past joined forces wednesday to push for legislation 
such as mandated autosafety features and a return to the 55 mph 
speed limit on all interstate highways 
the advocates for highway and auto safety will pursue a 
balanced and aggressive approach to reduce highway deaths and 
injuries and the high cost of automibile accidents said executive 
director judith lee stone 
insurers hope improved auto safety will help stem rising auto 
insurance costs said gerald l maatman president of kemper 
national property and casualty cos one of several major insurance 
firms joining the coalition 
researchers say auto accidents kill 48000 americans a year and 
cost an estimated 74 billion 
in the past the insurance industry has come under fire from 
consumer advocate groups over the cost of premiums 
maatman said reform movements like one in california where 
voters passed a referendum mandating reduced rates helped prompt 
the industry to join the coalition the referendum was promoted by 
consumer advocate ralph nader 
theres no doubt the california referendum has heightened in 
the minds of our industry the fact that the public is now expecting 
an increased amount of effort in participation on problems 
maatman said 
in a telephone interview nader said the insurance industry had 
taken a first step toward fulfilling its neglected responsibility 
in loss prevention 
nader said that without the california referendum insurance 
companies never would have done this 
insurance companies and groups representing 40 percent of the 
american automobile insurance market have pledged 15 million for 
the organizations efforts in the first year stone said 
at the federal leval the group backs a senate bill to extend 
current auto safety features to trucks and vans it also adds 
features to protect against impact from side collisions and require 
motorcycle helmet usage antilock brakes and passenger side air 
bags 
the group also wants a return to the 55 mph speed limit on all 
interstate highways in 1987 congress allowed states to raise the 
speed limit to 65 mph on rural stretches of interstates 
at the state and local level the group plans to push issues 
such as drunken driving safety belts and child seats 
insurance discounts for using safety devices are not among the 
groups priorities 
we will work hard to make this marriage work and well worry 
about whether we have any children later maatman said of 
divisive issues that might come up later 
consumer advocate groups that will be part of the coalition 
include public citizen a naderfounded group in addition safety 
and medical experts will also be on the group

tens of thousands of protesters 
demanding justice peace and freedom marched wednesday through 
an east london seaside resort in what probably was south africas 
largest legal demonstration 
in johannesburg the city council voted to desegregate buses 
swimming pools and recreation centers 
the decision to integrate all public facilities controlled by 
the city south africas largest counters wishes of most white 
voters who in a poll earlier this year approved desegregating buses 
and recreation centers but opposed opening whitesonly pools to 
blacks 
among those marching in east london was the white managing 
director of the citys mercedesbenz car manufacturing plant and 
many of the companys black employees who were given the day off 
to take part 
police estimated the crowd at 25000 to 40000 
the largest previous governmentapproved rally was a march in 
downtown cape town two weeks ago by 20000 to 25000 people 
there have been mass demonstrations across the country since 
president fw de klerk announced sept 13 that authorities would 
not break up lawful peaceful protests 
the east london rally for justice peace and freedom was led 
by david russell the anglican archbishop of grahamstown along 
with other local clerics and human rights lawyers 
protesters clogged the downtown area and most shops closed for 
the day marchers danced chanted and sang freedom songs and some 
carried the green gold and black flag of the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement 
rally leaders marched to the headquarters of the security police 
and presented written demands for the release of political 
prisoners legalization of banned opposition groups and lifting of 
the 3yearold state of emergency 
there was a heavy police presence including armored vehicles 
and a helicopter but officers stood aside and no incidents were 
reported 
all the approved rallies in the past two weeks have been 
peaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in 
southeastern pietermaritzburg in pretoria police used clubs 
saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with a protest 
march that was not authorized 
wednesdays rally was part of a nationwide protest campaign 
launched aug 2 targeting segregated schools hospitals beaches 
buses and other facilities 
in johannesburg white students at rand afrikaans university 
jeered 200 black students who marched wednesday to protest 
segregated dormitories about 75 percent of students at the 
overwhelmingly white university voted last week to maintain 
segregated residences the black students said 
the johannesburg city council vote does not affect schools 
neighborhoods or hospitals that are segregated by national and 
provincial laws also private facilities may be segregated under 
the separate amenities 
the council voted tuesday night amid strong opposition from 
members of the farright conservative party 
in a poll earlier this year white johannesburg voters favored 
desegregating buses and recreation centers but 60 percent voted 
not to swim with blacks 
we are taking a large step in south african terms said 
council member harold rudolph i am so glad we are putting right 
that which was wrong 
most public facilities in major cities have been desegregated in 
recent years either informally or by repealing legislation cape 
town already has formally repealed racist laws 
johannesburg durban and cape town are considered the most 
liberal cities in the country towns just outside johannesburg 
such as boksburg have been reimposing rigid apartheid since the 
conservative party won control of some local councils in municipal 
elections a year ago 
the johannesburg council is controlled by president fw de 
klerks national party

the no 3 executive at cbs said wednesday he 
will investigate claims that the cbs evening news in the 
mid1980s aired fake combat footage and false news reports of the 
war in afghanistan 
the new york post reported wednesday that most of the questioned 
footage was shot by mike hoover 45 a freelancer who covered the 
war on a storybystory basis for cbs and won an oscar in 1985 for 
a short liveaction film called up 
im going to have to look into it cbs broadcast group 
president howard stringer a former cbs news president said of the 
claims in the post which cited military and media sources in 
the united states europe and asia 
the post quoting an afghan rebel who it said served as hoovers 
translator reported that hoover staged scenes of guerrilla 
sabotage the paper also quoted a defense consultant as saying the 
cameraman passed off pictures of a chinesemade pakistani jet 
fighter on a training mission as a sovietmade jet bombing afghan 
villages in 1986 
stringer was executive producer of anchorman dan rathers cbs 
evening news but left it in january 1984 10 months before the 
disputed footage aired in two reports the reports won the 
broadcast a prestigious columbiadu pont silver baton award 
in the broadcasts film shot by hoover showed mujahedeen rebels 
reportedly blowing up pylons to cut power to the afghan capital of 
kabul during the war that began in 1979 
the actual sabotage the post said occurred 12 days before 
hoover arrived on the scene 
a rebel serving as hoovers translator told the newspaper that 
hoover persuaded rebel leaders to order about a dozen of their 
troops back to the site so he could stage the explosions according 
to the newspaper identifying the translator only as etabari 
we cant respond to the story until we talk to the freelance 
cameraman involved said cbs spokesman tom goodman 
hoover was unavailable for comment a woman who the post said 
identified herself as his wife said he was working in remote caves 
in new zealand and couldnt be contacted 
it is the goal of cbs in every instance to gather and report 
the news accurately fairly and with integrity in the case of the 
afghan war we believe we have done so cbs news president david 
burke said in a statement 
rather did not immediately return calls 
stringer declined to comment on the post story saying he hadnt 
read it i dont know who the people involved are or who the 
accusations are coming from he said 
in a 1987 los angeles times interview hoover explained that he 
proposed coverage of the afghan war on a storybystory basis and 
never was turned down he said rather was really the muscle 
behind his cbs assignments 
the denverborn hoover also said in the interview he didnt 
regard himself as a news cameraman in the traditional sense im 
really kind of a filmmaker he said 
perry wolff executive producer of a cbs reports documentary 
in 1987 an emmywinner called the battle for afghanistan that 
used some of the questioned footage did not return phone calls 
rather narrated that documentary 
this summer a cbs source said wolff was suspended by cbs news 
after the disclosure that a july special on mans first walk on the 
moon identified footage taken in 1972 as having occurred during the 
first moon walk in 1969 
wolff called it an honest mistake and blamed a mislabeled 
tape both he and cbs news spokesmen have refused to confirm or 
deny that he was suspended 
the post also quoted h joachim maitre dean of boston 
universitys college of communications as saying cbs news in 1987 
bought footage stolen from mohamed salam an afghan journalism 
student at the school 
the post said rather on a cbs evening news broadcast later 
showed the footage and described it as a the biggest oneday 
defeat for soviet forces since world war ii when in fact 
according to maitre thered been no such battle 
what the tape actually showed maitre said was a small 
successful rebel attack against afghan government troops he said 
he asked for and got an apology from cbs 
maitre an east german defector known for conservative political 
views was not available for comment his office said a secretary 
there said he was at an allday conference on defense journalism in 
washington

supporters of two rival political factions battled in windhoeks 
black townwship wednesday hospital officials said 20 people were 
injured 
the fracas began as the democratic turnhalle alliance drove a 
united nationsmonitored motorcade through a neighborhood that 
supports the guerrillabacked southwest africa peoples 
organization called swapo 
residents of the neighborhood accused alliance supporters of 
stoning houses that flew swapo flags 
one rock struck the head of a 2yearold boy standing in the 
doorway of his home said residents he was hospitalized in serious 
condition they said 
a 20yearold man was hospitalized with multiple cuts on his 
head and 15 to 20 other people were treated for cuts and bruises 
hospital officials said 
no arrests were reported 
the united nations is monitoring the campaign leading to 
independence elections nov 711 observers were present when the 
violence began but their job was to monitor the police said un 
spokesman fred eckhard 
un special representative martti ahtisaari has requested a 
meeting with territorial administrator louis pienaar to discuss 
how law enforcement authorities came to allow such a situation to 
arise eckhard said 
the southwest africa peoples organization whose guerrilla 
wing fought a largely unsuccessful 23year war against south 
african rule of the territory is favored to win most votes in the 
election its chief opponent is the democratic turnhalle alliance 
a multiracial party that participated in a transitional government

the slovenian parli 
the federal parliament earlier wednesday asked slovenia to postpone 
adoption of the changes 
westernstyle democracy is generally opposed in yugoslavias 
other regions 
commenting on the vote joze smole head of the slovenian 
socialist alliance a communistled umbrella organization told the 
ap that we must now calm the passions aroused by this in 
yugoslavia 
it is a gross lie that slovenia wishes to withdraw from 
yugoslavia smole said dismissing protests against the changes 
as irrational acts 
authorities in slovenia have never actually proposed that the 
republic withdraw from the yugoslav federation 
slovenias 2 million inhabitants make up 8 percent of 
yugoslavias population and speak a different language from the 
serbocroat used by threequarters of the federations inhabitants 
they have traditionally safeguarded their autonomy since the 
region was incorporated into yugoslavia in 1918 
the leadership of serbia slovenias main political foe 
advocates strengthening the role of the loose federation by 
granting greater powers to the federal government limiting local 
autonomy 
serbian lawmakers repeatedly charged that the amendments would 
open the door to the eventual breakup of the yugoslav federation 
federal authorities including the countrys 8member 
presidency repeatedly demanded that some proposed amendments be 
dropped because they conflict with the federal constitution 
the armed forces came out openly wednesday in support of the 
serbian position in the longstanding political feud between 
liberals and conservatives 
the consequences which could arise from these amendments are 
extremely serious and we must warn the slovenian authorities 
about this said adm stane brovet a central committee member 
but milan kucan head of the slovenian party told the session 
slovenian communists will choose to defend the interests of the 
slovenian people rather than become quislings

angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi has proposed a fivepoint peace plan calling for an african 
force to supervise a truce in his countrys 15year civil war 
according to reports wednesday from london and portugal 
savimbis plan outlined to a congress of his national union for 
the total independence of angola at his bush headquarters in jamba 
southeastern angola was reported by the british broadcasting corp 
in london and correio da manha a portuguese newspaper in lisbon 
the usbacked guerrillas are proposing direct talks with the 
marxist government that won power shortly after independence from 
portugal in 1975 a ceasefire and release of all political 
prisoners a transitional government of national unity immediate 
rewriting of the constitution and free and fair elections 
according to the reports the plan calls for a monitoring force 
from several african nations to supervise the ceasefire three 
months after it begins formation of a transitional government 
within nine months and six months later elections supervised by 
the united nations and the organization of african unity 
a june 24 ceasefire mediated by zaires president mobutu sese 
seko quickly broke down with each side blaming the other 
efforts to bring them together for new talks have failed last 
month eight african leaders endorsed the angolan governments 
peace plan which calls for savimbi to be exiled from the country 
during a transitional period and for his forces to be absorbed into 
the present government 
savimbi says he will not consider leaving the country and that 
his forces have not been defeated and would not accept integration 
into the ruling popular movement for the liberation of angola led 
by president jose eduardo dos santos 
south africa provided military aid to the guerrillas during much 
of the civil war but agreed to halt that assistance as part of a 
regional peace plan that includes the withdrawal of the 50000 
cuban troops in angola 
the united states continues to aid the guerrilla movement and 
the soviet union still supports dos santos government 
the state department has supported savimbis insistence that 
elections be held in angola 
his movement never has had a chance to test its popularity at 
the polls the portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the 
country in 1975 leaving three rival factions to fight for power 
dos santos group won

secretary of state james a baker iii opening a 
round of talks with mideast leaders wednesday offered assurances 
to israel of full us support for its proposal for palestinian 
negotiations 
baker met for 45 minutes with israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens afterward arens and a senior us official said baker had 
not asked israel to adopt a formula for negotiations sponsored by 
egyptian president hosni mubarak 
we have wholehearted american acceptance of the israeli peace 
initiative and nothing has changed on that arens told reporters 
there is no alternate initiative to ours there is only one 
peace initiative on the table and it is the one that was formulated 
by mr shamir he said 
we didnt discuss any new formula the foreign minister said 
mubaraks 10point formula includes at least two elements 
rejected by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir that 
negotiations should be based on an israeli commitment to yield 
territory for peace and should include palestinians from outside 
the west bank and gaza as participants in the talks 
two prominent labor party members of the israeli cabinet deputy 
prime minister shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin 
have approved of mubaraks approach 
but labor is in the minority in the coalition government shamir 
and arens are from the dominant likud coalition 
a senior us official said baker had told arens that he did not 
view mubaraks 10 points as a proposal or as a plan 
we are not asking them the israelis to accept the 10 
points this official said at a briefing for reporters conducted 
under ground rules that prohibit identification 
the 10 points are not a basis for negotiations describing 
them instead as a vehicle for a dialogue 
baker will continue the discussions at a threeway meeting on 
thursday with egyptian foreign minister esmet abdulmeguid and 
arens 
on friday arens meets with mubarak who is in new york to 
address the special session of the un general assembly 
next wednesday the principal members of the israeli cabinet 
will meet for a formal decision on the egyptian leaders formula 
shamirs proposal is to hold elections among the 14 million 
palestinian arabs who live on the west bank and gaza to chose 
negotiatiors 
they would work out a fiveyear program of local selfrule with 
israel this would be followed by negotiations on an overall 
settement with egypt and jordan as well 
egypt formerly controlled the gaza strip and jordan the west 
bank israel conquered the territories in a 1967 war against many 
of the countrys arab neighbors

a gay rights group offered 100 wednesday to the 
first person who refuses to participate in a federal doortodoor 
aids survey contending it is a waste of time 
the survey of 3400 dallas county residents begins saturday if 
officials of a research group hired to conduct the survey are 
satisfied with the sampling they will canvass about 50000 homes 
nationwide 
william waybourn president of the dallas gay alliance said his 
group will pay 100 for the first uncompleted survey form brought 
to its headquarters 
thereafter for each one not completed and brought to us we 
will contribute 50 to aids research he said we challenge the 
county for every one they get completed to donate the same amount 
to research 
the government is paying survey participants 50 each 
the organization and other activists piled 90 dummies on the 
steps of the dallas county health department on tuesday to 
represent the estimated number of aids deaths here during the 
survey period of three to four months thousands more would perish 
over the span of a threeyear national study activists claim 
the dallas survey is a pilot project to determine the 
feasibility of another study that could cost up to 32 million 
said waybourn if the federal government can put its aids 
treatment efforts on hold for three years the government can save 
money but thousands more will die 
one health official said it would be imprudent for opponents to 
sabotage the survey 
that just reflects a lack of appreciation on what is going on 
in aids treatment and research tremendous sums are being spent on 
them millions are spent on aids care said dr gordon green 
director of the dallas county health department 
dallas county was chosen for the experimental survey because of 
the high number of people suspected of being exposed to the aids 
virus between 15000 and 30000 the countys population also 
includes a favorable variety of ethnic and social groups health 
officials said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the hiv or 
human immunodeficiency virus the virus damages the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and 
cancer 
the national household seroprevalence survey would be the first 
to track the virus through the general population said donald l 
zimmerman the research triangle institutes director of outreach 
programs in research triangle park nc 
the nonprofit research agency has been hired to conduct the 
survey for the federal government zimmerman said he didnt think 
the survey which got an 85 percent response rate during a trial in 
pennsylvanias allegheny county would be hurt by opponents 
efforts 
i dont think the opposition reflects accurately the 
opinion of the gay community zimmerman said in this survey 
it doesnt matter whether someones gay or not likewise the virus 
doesnt care whether you are gay or not 
the us department of health and human services which last 
month approved the anonymous survey of dallas county residents 
sent letters tuesday to selected households 
survey teams will ask one adult in each of the randomly chosen 
households to take a blood test for the aids virus and answer 
questions about sexual habits and drug use 
a dallas gay alliance official john thomas said the 
organization doesnt have the money in hand to donate 50 to 
research for all 3400 surveys but he said the groups 700 members 
will raise it or contribute themselves

congressional negotiators wrestled wednesday 
with whether the government should finance exhibitions of art some 
peoplem consider obscene reaching no solution but revealing clues 
about the direction they are headed 
house and senate bargainers planned to resume their efforts on 
thursday to find a compromise to a measure proposed by sen jesse 
helms rnc and passed by the senate barring federal subsidies 
for obscene or indecent material or works that offend members 
of any race religion or sex 
rep sidney yates dill an opponent of the helms provision 
said he was considering offering guidelines similar to supreme 
court rulings permitting federal aid to art that attained certain 
artistic scholarly or other standards 
yates long a supporter of federal backing of the arts has said 
the socalled helms amendment is little short of government 
censorship 
we dont want to hamstring the national endowment for the 
arts the national endowment for the humanities and every museum in 
the country he said 
sen james mcclure ridaho a conservative who said he supports 
the thrust of helms language said he believed a study of the 
endowments grantmaking procedures was needed he also said 
legislation was needed stating what current congressional 
attitudes are about offensive art 
somebody made a mistake mcclure said during the 
negotiations somebody should have stopped those materials from 
being a taxpayerfinanced show 
helms who is not a negotiator on the fate of his own amendment 
told a reporter that he believed the bargainers would gut his 
proposal and indicated he might force the full senate to vote on 
whether to drop any compromise that emerges in favor of his 
original provision 
im not going to back up one inch he said they may have 
to vote on it three or four times before were through 
two grants made by the national endowment for the arts in the 
past year prompted helms provision 
one of the controversial grants supported an exhibit that 
included a photograph by andres serrano of a christ figure 
submerged in a jar of urine the other included robert mapplethorpe 
photographs depicting homosexual acts and the genitalia of children 
helms provision is part of the 109 billion senate version of 
a bill making appropriations for interior department and certain 
other programs including arts programs 
the 115 billion house version includes a symbolic 45000 cut 
sponsored by yates in the 171 million appropriation for the 
national endowment for the arts the two grants at issue came to 
45000 
yates is chairman of the house appropriations interior 
subcommittee and leads the house members of the conference 
committee handling the question 
the senate adopted the helms amendment with almost no debate on 
a july 26 voice vote 
helms and other conservatives have argued that the government 
has no business backing works of art that are ffensive to most 
people 
some arts groups civil libertarians and others have said the 
measure represents unconstitutional censorship although many have 
conceded that the endowments use of the money seemed of 
questionable taste 
the helms amendment prohibits federal aid for obscene or 
indecent materials including depictions of sadomasochism 
homoeroticism the exploitation of children or individuals engaged 
in sex acts 
it forbids tax money to be spent on art that denigrates 
people based on their religion race sex handicap age or ethnic 
origin 
it also bans for five years any federal assistance to the 
southeastern center for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
which showed the serrano work and the institute of contemporary 
art at the university of pennsylvania which hosted the 
mapplethorpe exhibit 
on sept 13 the house rejected 264153 an attempt by 
conservatives to accept the helms amendment

a draft law dubbed the journalists dream for 
its ban on censorship and secretive government has won support from 
a working group of three legislative committees moscow news 
reported wednesday 
the bill includes a section ordering government organizations to 
answer questions from the press they may refuse only on the 
grounds of state or other legal secrets and reporters may appeal 
to the courts the newspaper said 
the measure supplanted a more restrictive version offered by the 
kremlin moscow news said the progressive paper called it the 
journalists dream because it would let them serve the 
interests of society and its citizens without taking into account 
the bureaucratic view of the world 
already the title has been changed from the law on the 
press to the law on freedom of the press the newspaper said 
it has been approved by a working group of the three legislative 
committees on law on glasnost and on science education and 
culture 
although the draft says that censorship of the mass media is 
not permitted its authors clearly have a realistic view of 
imposing such a drastic change on the soviet union censorship has 
considerably eased under president mikhail s gorbachev but 
official publications still must bear the censors approval stamp 
before they can be printed 
moscow news said the bill would allow only the prosecutor to 
hold up publication a court would have to rule within 72 hours 
whether the edition will be fully distributed confiscated or 
delayed for a specified time it said 
the draft specifically permits the media to print the name and 
rank of any person who succeeds in halting publication of an item 
it said 
libel law is simple if a publication does not have evidence to 
support its charges it must print a correction 
the supreme soviets committee on legislation legality and the 
rule of law will consider the bill thursday the official news 
agency tass said 
certain bureaucrats dislide the draft the paper said including 
an unidentified representative of the state publishing committee 
he was quoted as telling a legislative hearing that the section 
allowing virtually any legal organization or citizen to start a 
newspaper would permit the cia to buy up all the newsprint in the 
country for publications it supports 
paper is in short supply here 
in other legislative committees wednesday deputy fyodor 
burlatsky a leader in the official organization involved in 
winning the release of hundreds of political prisoners charged 
that moscow is lagging on its promises to pass human rights 
guarantees tass reported 
it is necessary to overcome the stereotypes and thought 
patterns remaining from the past and clear a road to new thinking 
in this area burlatsky was quoted as saying 
he said the proposed law on emigration has serious drawbacks and 
a law on human rights has been delayed tass reported 
tass said other deputies asked further cuts in the military 
budget than the proposed 8 percent for a wage freeze for 
bureaucrats and for public sale of apartments garden plots and 
building lots for summer cottages private land ownership is now 
banned under soviet law

accompanying a rocket ship made of purple construction paper 
krikalev 31 a flight engineer who lives near moscow visited 
367 kindergarten through secondgrade students at the mars primary 
center he was joined later wednesday by us astronaut mario runco 
jr 37 a navy lieutenant commander awaiting assignment to his 
first shuttle mission 
hopefully this is one small step if you will for some future 
cooperation between the two nations runko told reporters after 
he gave the school 485 nasa photographs 
the soviet spaceman said he was touched by the students gifts 
which included letters tshirts freshcut flowers russian tea 
cakes and crayon and watercolor renderings of their vision of outer 
space 
its not so much the gifts its the friendliness that went 
behind the gifts its coming from the insides of the people who 
gave the gifts he said 
krikalev passed out photographs showing himself and his two 
partners during a fivemonth frenchsoviet soyuz mission that ended 
in april 
the cosmonaut in mars for an eightday visit and runko were 
invited to this small community 25 miles north of pittsburgh by the 
mars area foundation for educational excellence both men also 
visited the communitys adams intermediate elementary school for 
grades two through five 
each man put on a rubber boot and stepped into a tray of brown 
clay then signed his name in the clay the footprints and 
signatures were sealed in glass and marked with a plaque noting 
that both men stepped on mars sept 27 1989 
the goal was to bring unusual cultural programs to the school 
district and it has blossomed beyond anything i had imagined 
said ralph terrell foundation chairman 
what i really want to promote is for the kids to study hard 
and in the future to get along with the other country krikalev 
said through an interpreter 
krikalev fielded questions from the students during a morning 
assembly then visited classrooms one student asked whether he 
worries about accidents like the explosion of the space shuttle 
challenger 
no we all have our jobs to do said krikalev whose gray 
suit sported a lapel pin depicting the us and soviet flags 
other students asked what its like to sleep eat and float in 
space 
i answer the same questions from our children he said with 
a smile 
the schools hallways were decorated with the childrens space 
drawings a flying saucer 10 feet in diameter and made of steel 
barrel lids adorned the town center 
krikalev said his soviet friends were surprised to hear of a 
town named mars and an american acquaintance in moscow had never 
heard of it 
i couldnt find mars on the map he said i didnt know 
what kind of clothes to bring because i didnt know where it was 
the teachers and the childrens parents seemed almost as excited 
as the children by the visit 
its almost like putting mars on the map this mars not the 
planet said minette thompson a fifthgrade teacher

usair and federal investigators wednesday 
dismissed a report the pilots of a jetliner that skidded into the 
east river last week had been drinking for five hours before 
getting into the cockpit 
meanwhile investigators said a device that holds the rudder 
steady for the pilot during takeoff was wrongly set in the full 
left position which could account for the drift the pilot reported 
led him to abort the takeoff 
that would tend to want to move the plane to the left if he 
didnt do other things to compensate for it said ted 
lopatkiewicz a national transportation safety board spokesman in 
washington 
peter baron who heads the national center for air traffic 
safety a consumer advocacy group said the rudder trim clearly 
could have been one of the factors that led to the crash he said 
it would not have become apparent until the plane had built up 
speed during takeoff 
responding to the drinking report usair spokesman david shipley 
in arlington va said the cockpit crew had only about two hours 
between the time they arrived at laguardia airport on sept 20 and 
the time they reported to the gate for the illfated flight 
thats documented he said 
in addition the ntsb said the copilot was on the plane for 
most if not all of that time while the captain went to usair 
offices at laguardia 
two passengers were killed after the boeing 737400 aborted 
takeoff and skidded into the water 
federal aviation administration regulations prohibit drinking up 
to eight hours before a flight 
drug and alcohol tests on the pilot and copilot came out 
negative but the urine samples were taken 48 hours after the 
accident making them virtually useless for alcohol testing 
the new york post reported wednesday that a detective close to 
the investigation said the crew may have spent as many as five 
hours in bars near the airport 
it said that a passenger ken trendel the husband of a usair 
employee told authorities immediately after the crash he had been 
out bouncing with the captain and the copilot investigators 
said they believed he meant drinking or bar hopping 
trendel said he the two pilots and a fourth man had been at a 
bar in the nearby marriott hotel between 730 pm and 930 pm on 
sept 20 the plane crashed at 1129 pm 
the ntsb has turned up no suggestion that the pilots were 
drinking lopatkiewicz said no one has volunteered that kind of 
information he said 
in addition shipley said capt michael w martin and copilot 
constantine kleissas did not arrive at laguardia until 840 pm 
they flew in from baltimore 
they were then assigned to flight 5050 which was scheduled to 
depart at 1030 pm the plane left the gate at 1052 pm and was 
held on the ground until about 1120 pm lopatkiewicz said 
the new york post story and this other gentlemans allegations 
just dont jibe with the facts shipley said 
lopatkiewicz said kleissas basically stayed with the plane 
most of the time 
martin went to the usair operations center to get weather 
information and fill out some paperwork he also had a meeting with 
some people in usairs ground control office lopatkiewicz said 
the post said trendel may be subpoenaed to testify before the 
grand jury investigating the crash

radio free europe and radio liberty 
opened a bureau in budapest on wednesday the first in eastern 
europe for the two usfunded radio stations 
the opening of this bureau is less a cause for surprise than a 
reflection of the fact that hungary is open to the free flow of 
ideas the stations president eugene pel said at the official 
opening 
hungary became the first soviet bloc country to accredit a 
permanent correspondent from the stations in may 
us ambassador mark palmer said rfe is a strange institution 
because its very aim is to selfdestruct we hope it will 
achieve this in hungary 
radio free europe was founded in 1949 and radio liberty two 
years later to inform people in the soviet union and eastern europe 
about issues they could not learn from the official media 
however in the wake of farreaching political reforms 
hungarian state media have become increasingly open and critical 
the sister stations with headquarters in munich west germany 
are controlled by the washingtonbased board of international 
broadcasting and are funded by the us government 
radio liberty broadcasts in 12 languages to the soviet union 
while radio free europe transmits to bulgaria czechoslovakia 
hungary poland and romania as well as the soviet states of 
lithuania latvia and estonia they reach about 55 million people 
after being jammed for decades the stations recently have 
benefited from a spirit of openness being promoted by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
however palmer noted some warsaw pact members still are 
resistant to reform there are still some countries in the region 
which need radio free europe he said 
the budapest office is to be staffed by a correspondent from the 
stations news and current affairs division and by programmers from 
hungarys broadcasting department it is to broadcast daily news 
and reports about hungarian events and issues as well as live 
programs station officials said 
wednesdays reception was attended by leading members of all the 
main opposition parties and groups in hungary 
none of the invited communist leaders were there but us 
officials familiar with hungarian affairs suggested they may have 
stayed away because of political commitments 
parliament is meeting this week to discuss key legislation to 
pave the way for transition to a multiparty system the communist 
party also is to hold a key congress in budapest next week at which 
reformists and hardliners are expected to clash 
in the past the communist leadership perceived radio free 
europe as a subversive force 
during the anticommunist uprising in 1956 radio free europe 
broadcasts led many hungarians to believe the west would help when 
soviet troops invaded to crush the revolt this did not 
materialize and many hungarians have remained resentful 
nevertheless the station is popular in hungary particularly 
among the countrys youth and intellectuals

in a move that could further delay the 
production of a scarce gas needed for nuclear warheads energy 
secretary james d watkins on wednesday ordered additional testing 
of the governments tritium reactors before they are restarted 
in a brief announcement watkins said all three 
tritiumproducing reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken 
sc would undergo ultrasonic testing for cracks before they are 
restarted 
watkins provided no details his spokeswoman christina sankey 
later said the decision was a change from earlier acceptance of a 
recommendation by the plant operator westinghouse corp that 
ultrasonic testing need not be completed before the first reactor 
is restarted 
ms sankey said it was too early to tell whether the 
additional testing would mean a further delay in restarting the 
first reactor designated k reactor 
watkins announced sept 7 that lowpower testing of the reactor 
would begin late next summer and that production would be resumed 
sometime in the octoberdecember quarter of 1990 
he said he would review the timetable next april 
tritium is a rare radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to boost 
the destructive power of nuclear warheads and to provide most of 
the power of thermonuclear warheads about 55 percent of any 
amount decays in the course of a year which means that warheads in 
service must periodically receive new supplies of the gas 
all three reactors have been closed for more than a year for 
repairs and safety improvements 
recent ultrasonic testing on the p reactor vessel at savannah 
river had discovered a potential indication of a crack in 
excess of nine inches in the area of a welded seam watkins said 
this finding is still being studied and further tests are being 
performed watkins said ms sankey said later were quite 
confident there is no crack in the vessel 
ms sankey said there was no technical reason to condition a 
k reactor restart on completion of the ultrasonic testing but that 
watkins chose to impose the condition in order to instill greater 
public confidence in the restart program 
in ultrasonic testing highfrequency sound waves are passed 
through the reactor vessel walls and any abnormalities show up as 
breaks in the waves the energy department last year had said it 
would require the completion of ultrasonic testing of the three 
reactors before any were restarted but the requirement was dropped 
after westinghouse took over from ei du pont de nemours amp co as 
operator of the plant last april 
james moore president of the westinghouse unit that is running 
the savannah river complex said in an interview last spring that 
ultrasonic testing for cracks would be just an added burden 
that would not enhance safety 
ms sankey said watkins decided this week to overrule the 
westinghouse recommendation after it was roundly cricitized by some 
of his own advisers environmental groups opposed to operation of 
the reactors also had criticized the plan 
a leak from a crack in the vessel of another savannah river 
reactor known as c reactor was discovered in 1984 that led to 
its permanent shutdown a year later

indefinitely by the suppression of peaceful dissent 
major said britain will offer a package to encourage people 
essential to hong kongs future stability and prosperity to stay

the exodus of east germans who have fled their country for greater 
freedom in west germany 
deeply moved we witness the fate of young people who are

world war ii that west germany would never again threaten its 
frontiers 
the wheel of history will not be turned back genscher said

senate rejection of a 300 million addition to 
president bushs star wars proposal reflects an increasing 
congressional sentiment to limit the program majority leader 
george mitchell said wednesday 
the senate as part of its work on a 288 billion military 
spending bill refused a day earlier to restore funds for star wars 
to a level closer to the 45 billion it approved last month in 
authorization legislation 
the overwhelming vote of 6634 was perceived by some lawmakers 
as a blow to the program 
i think there is a growing recognition that we have to 
reduce our expectations and level of resources committed to it 
mitchell dmaine told reporters the senate vote was a strong 
indication of concern in that regard he said 
president reagan proposed star wars formally known as the 
strategic defense initiative six years ago hailing it as a 
nuclearage antidote to a strike against the united states 
but vice president dan quayles recent comment that the reagan 
administrations sdi astrodome approach to protect the united 
states was political jargon and the soviet unions decision to 
separate star wars from a strategic arms reduction treaty have 
undercut support for the program 
sdi has now been cut loose sen john warner of virginia 
ranking republican on the armed services committee said tuesday 
work on the military spending bill was put aside wednesday as 
the senate took up a 94 billion compromise plan to pay for the 
bush administrations war on drugs that plan was approved 972 
later in the day however the senate did briefly take up the 
bill and passed by voice vote an amendment limiting production of 
the airborne selfprotection jammer until further testing is 
completed in addition a nonbinding resolution was introduced 
calling for us participation in a multinational antidrug strike 
force 
the senate will vote on that measure thursday when it is 
expected to complete the appropriations bill a handful of 
amendments on antisatellite weapons us troop levels in europe 
and star wars are still pending 
the senate appropriations committee in adopting the spending 
legislation approved on a 1611 vote a measure requiring that 820 
million of the 37 billion for star wars be used for research on 
lasers and particle beams 
proponents of the amendment expressed concerns that the 
administration will sacrifice longterm research on directed energy 
weapons such as lasers and particle beams in favor of a quick fix 
or a phase 1 deployment that would favor the socalled 
brilliant pebbles scheme favored by many in the administration 
the funding level for star wars adopted in the appropriations 
bill totals about 41 billion 37 billion for the pentagons 
program and 355 million in energy department and military 
construction money that falls 900 million short of what bush 
requested for the program in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
among the other amendments are 
a measure to bar funds for antisatellite weapons tests unless 
the administration could certify that the soviets had engaged in 
tests of their own had refused to bargain in good faith in 
limitations and had blocked international verification efforts 
a proposal calling for either a reduction of 30000 american 
troops stationed in europe or a requirement that us allies foot 
the bill for those personnel if nato and the warsaw pact nations 
fail to reach a conventional arms agreement by oct 1 1990

cambodian forces could quickly 
defeat khmer rouge guerrillas if thailand stopped giving them 
shelter vietnamese military officers said wednesday 
in thailand the countrys top military leader said bangkok will 
stop aiding the guerrillas after it has confirmed that vietnamese 
soliders have indeed left the country and after all other foreign 
aid is halted 
relief officials meanwhile said a large khmer rouge refugee 
camp just inside the thai border was shelled from cambodia 
presumably by government forces 
the khmer rouge reported a new offensive on the strategic 
cambodian city of pailin and contended vietnamese soldiers still 
were defending the city vietnam denied the allegation insisting 
it withdrew the last of its troops tuesday 
officers from vietnams 5th division one of the most active in 
fighting in cambodia said they had achieved all their goals before 
withdrawing from their communist neighbor after a 10year 
occupation 
the difficulties which our division faced in the cambodian war 
were very minor compared with those faced in the war with 
america said bui buc tran deputy commander of the 5th division 
in the american war we had the philosophy that one doesnt 
win because of equipment and supplies but because ones cause is 
just i think the cambodian people also have a just cause in trying 
to prevent the return of the khmer rouge he said 
about 2000 of the withdrawn troops are being housed on this 
base near tay ninh about 35 miles from the cambodia border 
at the united nations in new york foreign ministers roland 
dumas of france and ali alatas of indonesia on wednesday welcomed 
vietnams withdrawal but asked new diplomatic negotiations to reach 
a comprehensive peace settlement 
france and indonesia are leaders of the international conference 
on cambodia which broke up in paris in august after the warring 
parties failed to agree on a peace plan 
the khmer rouge are loosely allied to two noncommunist 
guerrilla groups that have been fighting the phnom penh government 
and the vietnamese who invaded cambodia in late 1978 and toppled a 
khmer rouge government 
the khmer rouge were in power in cambodia from 197578 during 
that time hundreds of thousands of cambodians died from khmer 
rouge executions famine and civil unrest 
after its invasion vietnam helped the prohanoi government it 
installed in phnom penh battle the khmer rouge and two other 
guerrilla groups armed by china and granted sanctuaries inside 
thailand 
if the thai government stops its support of the guerrillas 
the cambodian government will have no problem ending the 
insurgency tran said we are completely satisfied that the 
cambodian people now have the full ability to defend themselves 
in bangkok gen pat akkanibut of thailands supreme military 
command told the associated press that thailands backing would 
continue until vietnams withdrawal could be proved and external 
military aid from all sides halted the soviet union is the major 
weapons supplier for cambodian government troops 
fighting along the thaicambodian border has intensified in 
recent weeks during the vietnam pullout 
the khmer rouge radio said its guerrillas have begun a new 
offensive on the gemtrading center of pailin in western cambodia 
and were shelling the town from all sides 
the guerrilla radio the voice of the national army of 
democratic kampuchea has claimed battle successes around pailin 
the town is northwest of phnom penh and close to the thai frontier 
the radio charged that hanoi has sent 3000 troops to help 
defend pailin 
vietnamese military spokesman thai denied the claims but 
acknowledged guerrilla forces had taken some territory 
hundreds of shells pelted a khmer rouge refugee camp near the 
cambodian border wednesday forcing thousands of refugees to flee 
or take cover a relief official said

president bush gave new ammunition to 
congressional democrats wednesday when he called on the 
international monetary fund to increase aid for polands 
beleaguered economy but said he was not ready to call for 
additional us help 
bush has been wrangling with the majority democrats since he 
revealed his proposal for 219 million in assistance to poland and 
hungary during his muchpublicized summer trip to warsaw 
the democrats who control the senate and the house have 
demanded that bush up the ante and do substantially more for 
eastern europe up to 37 billion more when the costs of 
democratic economic and foodaid plans are totaled 
bush has resisted contending that it is inappropriate to give 
more aid until the poles themselves demonstrate they can and will 
revolutionize their countrys staterun communist economy and turn 
to freemarket principles 
congressional republicans meanwhile accuse the democrats of 
political oneupmanship in a politically motivated bidding game 
the republicans are irked that the democratic leadership is 
characterizing the bush proposals as pathetically timid and 
woefully inadequate 
on wednesday the scenario took another turn as bush urged the 
world bank and the international monetary fund to do more for 
poland because of our selfevident stake in its success 
for its part the united states intends to be out in front of 
this effort to take advantage of this historic development and to 
ensure its success bush said 
but immediately after his address the president told questioning 
reporters he is not now prepared to commit himself to increasing 
his own aid package for poland 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine leading the 
recent chorus of democratic criticism repeatedly has described the 
administrations response to a potentially historic opening toward 
democracy in eastern europe as inadequate and disappointing 
the administrations timidity in the face of these 
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying mitchell said in a 
senate speech last week 
bush supports making 119 million in economic assistance 
available to poland over the next three years he also proposes 
100 million in food assistance an amount that was doubled from a 
proposed 50 million after the personal intervention of senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas who met with polish leaders 
in warsaw last month 
congressional democrats are rallying support for food and 
economic assistance packages for eastern europe that total at least 
37 billion most of it earmarked for poland 
the senate foreign relations committee ignoring boycotting 
republicans voted 101 a week ago to send to the senate floor a 
118 billion threeyear economic aid package for poland and 
hungary 
that democratic proposal would authorize 423 million in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 and 381 million in each of the 
next two years 
the centerpiece of the plan is an annual 300 million 
enterprise fund to support private economic development in 
poland and a similar 75 million annual aid fund for hungary 
on tuesday eight democratic members of the senate agriculture 
committee proposed canceling polands 2 billion agricultural debt 
to the united states as the keystone of a 225 billion food aid 
package 
chairman patrick leahy dvt urged bush to accept the 
proposal which would give poland 150 million in corn grain 
sorghum wheat butter and pork products the plan also seeks 
authorization of an additional 150 million in other assistance and 
calls for the extension of preferential tariff treatment and 
technical agricultural aid 
the presidents plan is a welcome but stopgap effort that 
fails to give poland the longterm help it needs to restructure its 
agricultural economy and to sustain the worlds newest economy 
leahy said 
joining the opposition chorus for increasing aid to poland 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said recently that 
the changing political environment in poland and hungary is so 
potentially historic that congress should quickly appropriate 
everything bush has requested then make substantial additions 
meanwhile the senate approved a resolution wednesday to 
dispatch a team of legislative and administrative experts to assess 
the immediate needs of polands new noncommunist parliament 
the aim of the resolution sponsored by sen pete domenici 
rnm is to lay the groundwork for a first gift of democracy 
from congress and the us private sector to the twochamber 
parliament in warsaw 
the measure which must also be endorsed by the house was 
approved by voice vote 
domenici recently returned from discussions with 
parliamentarians in warsaw said they lack the most rudimentary 
equipment to do their jobs including typewriters computers 
copying machines and research and information facilities

portuguese prime minister anibal 
cavaco silva laid a wreath wednesday at the tomb of mozambicans who 
died fighting for independence from portugal then discussed 
improving relations with the former colony 
at a meeting with mozambican president joaquim chissano cavaco 
silva said the traumas of the past are over 
we must have a spirit of construction he said 
the two men met on the second day of the portuguese leaders 
fiveday visit 
we want to consolidate the existing relations between portugal 
and mozambique that have been forged over centuries chissano 
said 
cooperation between the two governments should bring mutual 
benefits despite the unequal levels of development he said in 
apparent reference to the lack of infrastructure and trained 
professionals in mozambique when portuguese colonialism ended 
chissano invited portuguese companies to help increase food 
production in mozambique where nearly half the 14 million people 
need partial or complete food aid he also suggested portugals 
membership in the european community could be used to the benefit 
of mozambique and other african countries 
the portuguese leader appeared to agree 
the tendency just to look eastwards in europe leaving 
africa aside should be avoided he said 
mozambiques economy has been drained by a civil war that has 
continued since independence in 1975 rebels of the rightleaning 
mozambique national resistance presently are engaged in peace talks 
with mozambican church leaders representing the marxist government 
cavaco silva earlier had laid a wreath at the starshaped white 
marble monument of heroes the burial place of several prominent 
members of the front for the liberation of mozambique who died in 
the revolution that led to independence among them are samora 
machel mozambiques first president and eduardo mondlane the 
first nationalist leader whom most mozambicans believe was killed 
by portuguese secret police machel died in an october 1986 plane 
crash that officials here blame on south africa a charge pretoria

condemned the execution of 16 kuwaiti shiite moslems in saudi 
arabia and called for the holy city of mecca to be liberated from 
the claws of oppression 
the saudi agents beheaded 16 of the best children of islam 
and added another black page to the thick volume of their black 
book ayatollah mohammad araki said in a statement read on tehran 
radio monitored in cyprus 
araki 99 was appointed paramount religious leader or marja 
taqlid by the countrys top theologians after the june 3 death of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
khomeini who died of a heart attack at age 86 was irans 
highest religious and political authority ayatollah ali khamenei 
voted to succed him in the political role is a middleranking 
cleric and lacks the authority needed to rule on religious matters 
the 16 shiites were beheaded after they were convicted by saudi 
authorities of planting bombs in mecca that killed a pakistani man 
and wounded 16 other pilgrims july 10 
after the death sentences were carried out saudi television 
screened taped interviews of the condemned men in which they 
confessed to setting the bombs and said two iranians at the iranian 
embassy in kuwait supplied them with explosives and training iran 
denied it 
araki said it was up to the moslem clerics not to remain 
silent adding 
it is up to them to raise their cry to inform the public to 
support islam and the religion of god and to salvage the two holy 
places from the claws of oppression and the government of the 
blasphemers 
iranian leaders have long demanded that mecca and medina 
islams holiest cities be wrested from the control of the saudi 
royal family and put in charge of an international commission 
following the executions iranian leaders repeatedly have called 
for revenge against saudi arabia 
on wednesday four masked men who said they represented 
hezbollah or party of god in kuwait and saudi arabia held a news 
conference in beirut and threatened to punish saudi arabia 
the executions brought to an end recent efforts to improve 
relations between shiite moslem iran and saudi arabia which 
follows the sunni moslem sect the two sects have been antagonistic 
since a split in islam in the 7th century 
relations between tehran and riyadh previously reached their 
nadir in 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims most of them iranian 
were killed in clashes with saudi security forces in mecca

government employees in charge of americas 
bomb factories and the contractors who run the plants have been 
let off the hook for the biggest environmental scandal of the 
century rep thomas luken complained wednesday 
luken dohio heads a house subcommittee thats been probing 
problems at the nations nuclear weapons plants which are so 
contaminated that the energy department expects cleanup costs to 
exceed 90 billion 
luken made public a letter in which the justice department said 
neither environmental protection agency nor federal bureau of 
investigation had ever sought prosecution of environmental crimes 
at weapons plants just one case has ever been referred to 
prosecutors involving a 1983 incident in tennessee but no charges 
were brought the congressmans staff said 
the unprecedented radioactive and hazardous waste pollution at 
does weapons plants results directly from the failure to hold 
anyone accountable luken said in a statement 
until environmental crimes at the weapons plants lead to jail 
sentences and until doe holds its contractors feet to the fire 
doe will continue to pollute faster than it is cleaning up said 
luken repeating his contention that someone should be put behind 
bars as punishment for the years of radioactive and hazardous waste 
contamination 
incredibly the department of justice and the doe inspector 
general are now telling us that does contractors and their 
employees have been let off the hook for the biggest environmental 
scandal of the century he said 
on tuesday sen john glenn dohio put into the senate record 
a doe inspector general report urging changes in the way the 
government handles weaponsplant contracts 
the lessons of the past tell us that to a major extent the 
enormous and costly problems facing the does nuclear program are 
due to a basic failure to adopt normal practices of 
accountability glenn said 
the report prepared at glenns request said the governments 
been forced to pay obviously fraudulent expenses and is barred from 
ordering the firing of incompetent weapons plant workers because of 
the way its contracts are written 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said the department would 
demand stronger contracts when they come up for renewal

governors at the education summit 
pressed the bush administration wednesday to free states and local 
districts from restrictions on federal school money and urged 
greater commitment to early childhood programs 
the two issues were among key themes emerging at the first 
working sessions of the twoday summit between president bush his 
cabinet and the nations governors 
of the first three sessions all of which were behind closed 
doors the most contentious was apparently on the topic the 
learning environment 
the moderator of the session federal drug policy coordinator 
william j bennett said in an often sarcastic summary to reporters 
that there was lots of talk about early childhood everyone 
agreed they like little children but he said that unless the 
nation did something about poor schools in later grades spending 
more money on early education programs would be a waste 
arkansas gov bill clinton in a summary of a second working 
session governance whos in charge said much of the 
discussion had to do with how to exchange red tape for results 
new mexico gov garrey carruthers a republican who cochaired 
that panel with democrat clinton told reporters that bush had 
spent 40 minutes in the session and had responded to governors 
pleas for more spending freedom with a challenge for more specifics 
on how states would demonstrate results in the absence of 
regulations 
carruthers said governors told the president let us do it our 
own way we will demonstrate that were doing it better 
a third session on how to revitalize the teaching profession 
centered on among other issues how to recruit more minorities 
but the discussion included a recognition that for a long time to 
come minority students will be taught mainly by white teachers 
said democratic washington gov booth gardner cochair of that 
group 
a twopage memo summarizing objectives for the summit by the 
national governors association outlined seven general national 
performance goals which members hoped would become more specific as 
the meetings progressed 
the memo a copy of which was given to the associated press on 
wednesday outlined points that governors were to make during 
closeddoor working sessions with bush 
those goals according to the document were that 
all children be ready for first grade by the time they reach 
the appropriate age 
student achievement levels rise to internationally 
competitive levels especially in math and science 
disparities in achievement between students of different races 
and economic backgrounds be dramatically reduced 
the number of students going to college or other higher 
education be greatly increased 
adult illiteracy be virtually eliminated 
schools have welltrained teachers and modern technology 
the memo proposed that once goals are set and steps taken to 
achieve them we should move to a report card issued every year 
on the efforts of students schools the states and the federal 
government 
the governors memo also suggested that the summit be used to 
push changes to give states more flexibility in using federal 
education dollars and to eliminate unnecessary regulation 
at an opening news conference the governors stressed national 
goals and played down the issue of federal money at the summit 
the federal funding question is not the major issue for this 
summit said clinton 
if we dont have national performance goals how are we going 
to move from the bottom to top in international exams in math and 
science how are we going to stop being the only advanced economy 
in the world that has no system for guaranteeing that all 
5yearolds are ready to start school he asked 
still on the issue of money the memo said governors would be 
calling on the federal government to keep commitments it has 
already made 
it suggested that governors urge bush to get each member of his 
cabinet to target federal resources to ten of the largest and most 
troubled districts and 50 to 100 poor rural districts to reduce 
racial and economic disparities in educational opportunities 
states for their part should agree to restructure the 
education system in each state work with the federal government 
to reduce losses in the student loan program and work toward 
drugfree schools the memo said

drug czar william bennett a bit 
player in president bushs education summit with the governors 
stole a scene tuesday night with a stinging review of one of the 
closeddoor discussions 
the truculent former reagan administration secretary of 
education moderated one of the sessions and had some feisty 
exchanges with new york gov mario cuomo and other democrats over 
defense spending 
but in summarizing the talks afterward for reporters bennett 
gave what was in effect a pox on both their houses democrats and 
republicans alike 
bennett a onetime philosophy professor said there was pap 
standard democratic pap there was standard republican pap and 
there was stuff that rhymes with pap on both sides too 
there were a couple of good exchanges an occasional outburst 
of candor attempts to suppress it but a few people persisted 
in candor so we got a few points made said bennett 
much of the discussion took part in total absence of any 
knowledge of what works or whats effective in the actual 
experience of school said bennett who published a series of 
what works guides when he ran the department of education from 
1985 to 1988 
several governors including mississippis ray mabus spoke to 
the importance of federal programs to help feed and nurture infants 
and preschool children including head start 
but bennett felt the emphasis on preschool development was 
being ballyhooed 
there was a lot of talk about early childhood everyone likes 
small children and wants to do better by them he said 
but he added you cant fix american education simply by 
focusing on early childhood because if you give kids good early 
education but you mess it up after that when they go into regular 
schools you havent done anything more than just spend more 
money 
he said everyone liked the idea of national performance goals 
for education 
one governor suggested that his fanny would be out if he 
didnt reach his accountability goals which i thought was 
encouraging and candid said bennett 
bennett said sardonically there is progress in one part of 
americas curriculum and that is the selfesteem curriculum we 
are doing worse but feeling much better about it 
in a recent international comparison american students scored 
last in math and koreans first he said but when asked if they 
were good at math 68 percent of the us youths said yes compared 
to only 23 percent of the koreans 
that is a sort of druginduced curriculum said bennett 
people feel good on drugs while not doing good at all 
asked why he felt much of the discussion was uninformed bennett 
replied some people were saying things that other people had 
written for them and they were reading them out of books and 
reading them off cards and thats fine but what we were hoping for 
was a candid discussion 
some people really talked some people didnt said bennett

a senior military officer said 
wednesday that the last vietnamese soldiers were hauled out of 
cambodia atop brokendown trucks to end vietnams nearly 
11yearlong war in cambodia 
now there are absolutely no vietnamese soldiers in cambodia 
said gen nguyen van thai chief spokesman for the ministry of 
defense 
thai also disclosed that vietnam will spend 5 million to move 
to vietnam the graves of vietnamese soldiers who were buried in 
cambodia 
and he said two soldiers died during the sixday pullout making 
them the last casualties in the conflict that has cost 55300 
vietnamese lives 
several vietnamese soldiers riding in vehicles that had broken 
down on their way home were towed across the border at moc bai 112 
miles from ho chi minh city between 4 pm and 5 pm tuesday 
thai said 
most of the soldiers had crossed by noon 
thai made his comments to several reporters including the 
associated press 
troops at the moc bai border crossing were serenaded by popular 
singers and cheered by thousands of children in an emotional 
homecoming earlier tuesday 
vietnam says it has withdrawn the last 26000 of its troops in 
cambodia although the cambodian guerrilla resistance calls the 
pullout a sham 
rebel radio broadcasts monitored in bangkok thailand on 
wednesday said khmer rouge troops launched a threepronged attack 
on the gemrich town of pailin on the thaicambodian border the 
broadcast claimed 3000 vietnamese troops were defending pailin 
thai denied the claims about vietnamese soldiers but 
acknowledged that guerrilla forces had taken some territory he 
said vietnamese troops left the area last year 
the announced vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears that 
cambodia will slide into a protracted civil war wars and bloody 
revolution have kept cambodia torn by conflict for the last 20 
years 
of the last two vietnamese soldiers killed in cambodia one died 
on sunday when the truck he was riding in overturned throwing him 
into the mekong river the same day a second soldier died when he 
and a cambodian soldier clasped hands as the two sped by each other 
in separate trucks on route 5 thai said the vietnamese soldier was 
yanked from his vehicle and pulled under the passing truck 
thai contradicted a recent report out of the cambodian capital 
phnom penh which quoted the vietnamese ambassador to cambodia as 
saying vietnam would continue giving military aid to cambodia 
thai claimed vietnam has no military advisers in cambodia and 
supplies no military aid to the cambodian government vietnam 
installed the cambodian government in 1979 after vietnamese troops 
invaded the country ousting the khmer rouge regime 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people during 
its brutal rule from 1975 until the vietnamese invasion in december 
1978 
thai acknowledged many vietnamese families are angry that their 
sons and husbands are buried in cambodia and not in vietnam he 
said the military would dig up the graves of the war dead and bring 
them back to vietnam 
he said many graves had been lost and remains of others were 
hard to find but vietnam would mobilize itself to get the remains 
back he estimated 90 percent of vietnams war dead had already 
been returned home 
still he said not all the mothers in vietnam can have 
the remains of their sons right now 
thai estimated that from 200 to 300 vietnamese were missing in 
action in cambodia and said vietnam would intensify its efforts to 
find them 
in ho chi minh city attention turned to the returning troops 
and the difficulties they will find having jobs 
the army says it has demobilized 500000 men between 1987 and 
1988 and that further discharges will occur this year and next 
col nguyen huu tinh commander of regiment 742 said that since 
last year 70 percent of his 1500 men have been sent back to 
civilian life he said he worries that many of them will not be 
able to find work 
one veteran interviewed at a shoe factory said it took him 
three years to find a job after he returned from cambodia in 1986 
vo dien luong 26 now works in an unskilled position glueing shoes 
together he said he wasnt satisfied with his work but that he had 
to eat 
unemployment in vietnam is generally recognized to exceed 20 
percent 
both tinh and luong and other soldiers and veterans interviewed 
wednesday said they were having trouble finding girlfriends and 
wives 
some suggest that vietnams inability to secure a clear victory 
in cambodia has contributed to soldiers apparent unpopularity but 
unemployment and the low earning power of a recently demobolized 
soldier are also factors

a 10yearold boy missing for nearly five 
days in an abandoned mine was found wednesday suffering from 
dehydration and mild frostbite but otherwise looking remarkably 
well 
joshua dennis was on a boy scout outing friday night when he got 
separated from the others in the hidden valley mine in western 
utahs oquirrh mountains 
if you dont believe in miracles youd better believe in 
this so help me said the boys grandfather robert dennis 
the boy was found by searchers on a ledge in the mine at about 
245 pm he said he had stayed on the ledge in the pitchblack 
darkness the whole time pacing back and forth at times without 
food or water 
he knew he should stay put said his tearful mother janeen 
dennis he prayed he said he was being taken care of while 
he waited 
she said he had faith he would be found 
he never heard rescuers until today she said and he 
heard their voices and he yelled for help and they heard him 
joshua was taken to tooele valley hospital before being flown by 
helicopter to a hospital in salt lake city 
he really looks remarkably well said trudy curtis the 
tooele hospitals nursing director of course hes very 
dehydrated very gaunt and very tired maybe a little shocky 
he does have what at this point we think is a mild frostbite 
on the toes curtis said but this is just remarkable 
dr tony woodward at primary childrens said it was not unusual 
for a 10yearold to survive without water for that period 
the boy from the salt lake suburb of kearns was taken to 
primary childrens medical center in salt lake city some 45 miles 
northeast of the mine where workers had tied a yellow ribbon 
around a pillar outside the emergency room and some 50 people 
cheered as he was wheeled in on a stretcher 
joshua was last seen inside the mine friday night with his 
father terry dennis and a group of boy scouts the father was 
helping supervise during an overnight camping trip 
the boy told rescuers and hospital personnel he become separated 
from the others and had tried to find his way out of the mine by 
feeling the walls curtis said stumbling and falling at one 
point he got scared and just stayed put 
searchers and joshuas family had all but given up hope of 
finding him alive after exhaustive searches of the mine in rugged 
dry canyon turned up no trace of the boy sheriff don proctor said 
earlier wednesday 
a utah power amp light co mine rescue team descended into the 
mine for a second day wednesday and found the boy between 600 and 
700 yards inside the eightlevel labyrinth the team was 
accompanied by a guide who had been doing historical research on 
the gold silver and zinc mine last worked in 1953 
the familys bishop phillip fielding had spent the day with 
the boys parents in a motel and was with them when the good news 
came 
its like nothing ive ever witnessed in my life an absolute 
miracle he said we practically had to carry them they were 
weak with joy

character witnesses called by the defense

with ardent supporters of bakker testifying that they thought he 
was a fine man who was underpaid and unjustly accused the defense 
was in its fifth day of trial with an interruption friday by 
hurricane hugo 
arnold santjer who owns a shiploading business in bradenton

the hotel at the ptl theme park 
asked whether he had any regrets santjer said im not 
unhappy the lord gave me the money to start with it was his in 
the beginning 
assistant us attorney jerry miller pressed santjer on cross 
examination about his confidence in bakkers claims that he would 
limit the number of partnerships to 25000 the indictment charges 
he sold more than 66000 
the 6foot3 220pound miller pointed to a water pitcher on a 
table and asked santjer if mr bakker said he could fit me

number of character witnesses after wednesdays testimony ms 
smith said 37 character witnesses had been called

witnesses in a trial 
bender however disagreed that he was calling character 
witnesses 
we have not put up anyone for the purpose of specifically 
being a character witness bender told potter these are the 
partners judge people who have put their money into this 
ministry 
potter said the defense was invited to put on whatever defense 
you feel is appropriate but he issued the warning im not 
going to sit here forever

ms smith asked if he objected to the use of 265000 in 
partnership money to pay church secretary jessica hahn for her

i have no problem if it was spent on the heritage grand 
jessica hahn or unwed mothers he said its their money to 
spend the way they see fit

defense forces troops raided an 
opposition printshop and an advertising agency wednesday and 
arrested eight people witnesses and opposition leaders said 
opposition leader ricardo arias calderon said in a telephone 
interview that seven people including three women were arrested 
when soldiers raided the sigma printing plant 
witnesses who asked anonymity for fear of reprisals said the 
troops loaded printing presses and other equipment onto two trucks 
and carted them away 
another opposition source who insisted on anonymity said 
valerio arauz owner of the cosmos advertising agency was also 
arrested in another defense forces raid but gave no details 
both companies were doing propaganda work for the civil 
democratic alliance a coalition of political parties labor unions 
and other groups opposed to panamas military dominated government 
the alliance popularly known by its spanish initials as adoc 
is engaged in a campaign to induce people not to pay taxes 
telephone or light bills buy lottery tickets or gamble in casinos 
to pressure the government into turning power over to civilians 
running water and virtually all the countrys other public 
utilities are governmentowned and so is the lottery and gambling 
casinos and the government depends heavily on them for revenue 
guillermo endara adocs presidential candidate has been on a 
hunger strike for the past eight days as part of the campaign 
according to international observers both endara and running 
mate arias calderon won the elections may 7 which the government 
annulled a few days later claiming the opposition had committed 
fraud 
opposition leaders have been demanding that the government 
respect the may 7 election and that gen antonio noriega step down 
as the defense forces chief and cease his de facto rule of the 
country 
noriega was indicted february 1988 by federal grand juries in 
florida of drug trafficking and money laundering charges and the 
united states has been exerting pressure including trade and other 
economic sanctions on panama in an effort to force him out 
so far noriega has refused to budge but the sanctions have left 
the government short of funds

parliament indicted former premier andreas 
papandreou early thursday ordering him to stand trial before a 
special court on charges he was involved in the 210 million bank 
of crete embezzlement scandal 
the 300member unicameral chamber also decided four of 
papandreous former senior cabinet members must stand trial with 
him for complicity in the scandal 
parliaments decision by secret ballot ended a twoday debate on 
evidence presented by a parliamentary commission of inquiry that 
recommended the five men be prosecuted 
the vote was 166 for 121 against with two blank ballots and 
six that were ruled invalid five deputies including papandreou 
were not present 
papandreou 70 and the former ministers from his panhellenic 
socialist movement pasok are accused of involvement in the 
embezzlement of the bank along with its chairman george koskotas 
the investigative parliamentary committee alleged that during their 
eight years in office they skimmed off interest from money 
deposited by statecontrolled organizations 
the indicted former ministers are agamemnon koutsogiorgas who 
was deputy premier and justice minister giorgos petsos of 
transport and communications dimitris tsovolas of finance and 
panayiotis roumeliotis of the ministry of national economy 
four of the accused appeared in parliament to defend themselves 
during the debate while roumeliotis a deputy of the european 
parliament sent a memorandum 
the accused face a minimum of five years imprisonment each if 
found guilty of the charges 
the debate began in a numbed atmosphere on tuesday morning 
hours after terrorist gunmen killed lawmaker pavlos bakoyannis a 
member of the conservative new democracy party led by his 
fatherinlaw constantine mitsotakis 
bakoyannis acknowledged killers the elusive november 17 
organization charged in a proclamation that he acted as a front 
when koskotas the bank scandals central figure set up a 
publishing company prior to buying the bank of crete in 1982 
making one of his rare appearances in parliament papandreou 
told the packed chamber wednesday that i have come not to 
respond to the transparent charges nor to my slanderers but to 
restore the truth 
he pointed out that accusations he accepted bribes from koskotas 
and that he authorized the embezzlement scheme were based solely on 
koskotas testimony 
papandreou accused local and foreign interests of being 
behind what he called his defamation a charge that he has made 
repeatedly since the bank of crete scandal officially broke last 
october 
before walking out of parliament for reasons of personal 
sensitivity papapandreou said he could accept political 
responsibility for the scandal but not criminal charges 
petsos who was not a candidate in the june election told 
parliament tuesday that papandreou was responsible for accusations 
he petsos had accepted bribes from koskotas in return for 
ordering state companies to deposit funds in his bank when it began 
encountering cash flow problems 
tsovolas also addressed parliament on tuesday he claimed the 
charges against him were a frameup because he refused to bow to 
pressure exerted by foreign and greek special interest groups 
koutsogiorgas who was dropped by the party as a candidate in 
the last election told the lawmakers shortly before they voted 
that he had not committed any wrongdoing and denied taking a 2 
million bribe from koskotas reportedly desposited in a swiss bank 
account 
papandreous socialist administration was succeeded by a 
conservativeleftist coalition government after national elections 
in june resulted in a hung parliament the government has vowed to 
send those involved in scandals to special courts before holding 
new elections by nov 5 
with the governing coalition controlling 173 seats it appeared 
certain when the debate started that the accused would be indicted 
this is the second indictment against papandreou who was 
referred to a special court last week for allegedly instigating 
widespread illegal wiretapping of friends and political opponents 
while in office 
it was the first time in greeces history that a political 
civilian leader was ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing 
in office 
the special court is not expected to hear the two cases until 
midnovember this raises the possibility that papandreou will be 
running for office in the next election while under indictment 
koskotas fled to the united states last november after a central 
bank audit at the bank of crete uncovered the embezzlement scheme 
the 35yearold fugitive in interviews from his salem mass 
prison cell where he is fighting extradition to greece claimed 
papandreou blackmailed him into embezzling funds for the benefit of 
his party 
according to a constitutional amendment passed by the 196774 
military dictatorship government officials can only be tried by a 
13member special tribunal made up of supreme court judges and 
appeals court presidents 
the indictments must be made by parliament acting on the 
recommendation of an inquiry conducted by deputies in the 
parliamentary period immediately following the one in which the 
crimes were allegedly committed

agreement will provide for a longtime stay by the united states 
the talks are expected to begin in december the lease on the 
six us bases expires in september 1991 and opposition to them is 
growing among filipinos who see the facilities as an infringement 
on national sovereignty 
quayle was to depart later thursday for malaysia 
on wednesday police hurled tear gas to disperse 2000 leftists 
demonstrating against quayle and the us bases 
his visit was also marked by the killing of two american 
civilians near a us base hours before he arrived from japan on 
tuesday police suspect communist rebels were responsible

clark local officials said both had lived in the area about two 
years

a sightseeing plane making its final 
approach for landing veered into a wooded hill near the grand 
canyon airport on wednesday killing 10 people and injuring the 
other 11 people aboard eight critically 
the aircrafts wings were sheared off by tall ponderosa pines 
but some passengers survived because the fuselage of the de 
havilland dhc6 twin otter remained largely intact said coconino 
county sheriff joe richards the two crew members were killed he 
said 
national park service ranger paul crawford who was among the 
first to reach the wreckage said some of the passengers were 
walking around when he arrived at the scene on a small ridge about 
300 yards east of a runway 
they were shellshocked they had that empty dazed look he 
said 
the twinengine grand canyon airlines plane was on its second 
flight of the day and making its final approach to the airport when 
the accident occurred said ronald l warren the airlines vice 
president and general manager he said it was cleared for landing 
preliminary reports indicate the aircraft touched down 
normally on the runway became airborne again and veered to the 
east side of the airport he said 
federal aviation administration spokeswoman elly brekke said the 
plane was about 1500 feet down the 9000foot runway when it 
veered to the right then to the left and into an open space where 
it descended into trees and crashed flipping over 
warren said the plane had left the airport at 9 am for the 
onehour scenic flight which covers about 100 miles and was on 
schedule for its arrival when it crashed at about 955 am 
all 19 passengers were americans he said several were from 
california and many were from the east coast two of the dead were 
modesto calif city councilman john sutton and his wife donna 
said modesto mayor carol whiteside 
the airport is located about five miles south of the grand 
canyon ten of the injured were taken by ambulance airplane and 
helicopter to the flagstaff medical center about 75 miles away 
the injured suffered fractures lacerations and head wounds 
said hospital spokeswoman ann hartmankolacky eight were listed in 
critical condition and two were stable the 11th person wasnt 
brought to the hospital apparently because the injuries werent 
that bad she said 
warren said the pilot was in his mid40s and had worked for the 
airline for 4 years he said the pilot was also a training officer 
and accustomed to handling unusual occurances unusual events 
that was his job and to teach others to handle them 
the copilot was in his mid20s and in his first season with the 
airline warren said both crew members were from tusayan 
the sheriffs office was to release additional information on 
passengers pending notification of relatives 
larry nickey a grand canyon national park fire department 
captain said there was fuel in the planes cockpit area but the 
wreckage did not catch fire its just good luck that we didnt 
have a fire richards said 
nickey said firefighters cut out the planes bottom to free a 
man and a woman he said they were the only two still alive in the 
plane when he arrived 
a national transportation safety board investigation team was 
not expected to reach the airport until late wednesday richards 
said the plane possibly had a power failure or may have struck a 
power line 
a small brushfire was caused by a downed power line but it was 
not known if the plane hit the line as it crashed 
warren said the craft manufactured in 1975 had been owned and 
operated by the airline for two years he said the aircraft had no 
history of any kind of problems 
no cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder was onboard 
because the devices arent required or even manufactured for that 
type of aircraft he said 
at the time of the crash winds were calm and visibility was not 
a problem although the sky was partly cloudy richards said 
gary mucho ntsb regional director said the plane normally is 
configured to carry 19 passengers and two crew members 
in 1986 a grand canyon airlines plane collided with a 
sightseeing helicopter inside the canyon killing 25 people in 
august 1983 10 people died when a sightseeing charter plan from 
las vegas smashed into a cliff near the canyons south rim a 
crashinvestigation report said the pilot encountered rough weather 
and could not climb out of the canyon 
in washington ntsb spokesman mike benson said the de havilland 
twin otter is a popular commuter plane that carries 20 passengers 
he said the model has been involved in 77 accidents since 1962

federal aviation officials gave final approval 
wednesday to a 23 billion new denver airport and signed a 60 
million grant to help launch construction of the huge facility on 
the plains northeast of denver 
crews were expected to begin work this week at the site 18 miles 
from downtown the groundbreaking would mark the end of a long 
struggle by denver officials that included a citywide referendum in 
may and battles with the citys major airlines 
federal aviation administrator james busey said the complex 
scheduled to open in 1993 will remove a major bottleneck from 
the aviation system 
that bottleneck is denvers stapleton airport which is reduced 
to one runway during bad weather and can cause traffic to backed up 
at airports that feed flights through it from around the country 
busey said the new airport to be built 18 miles northeast of 
downtown denver will be the nations third busiest by 2000 in both 
number of flights and passengers stapleton currently ranks fifth 
the new airport would handle 817000 takeoffs and landings and 
board 332 million passengers a year busey said it will open with 
five runways and expand to 12 by 2020 
replacing stapleton with a new allweather airport not only 
will benefit denver but also will promote more efficient traffic 
flows nationwide the faa chief said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner noted that the airport 
will be the first major complex since the dallas fortworth airport 
was opened in 1974 
the grant for denver is to be used to reimburse cost of 
obtaining the land and to fund relocation assistance terminal 
building design and initial site preparation for the main terminal 
area and an eastwest runway faa officials said 
the grant followed federal aviation administration approval of a 
final environmental impact statement for the new airport marking a 
formal federal goahead for the project environmental study of the 
site took two years 
denver voters approved the airport in a referendum earlier this 
year

president bush urged governors at an 
education summit wednesday to forge fundamental changes to rescue 
the nations troubled schools but was told in return the federal 
government must spend more if that goal is to be reached 
weve got to challenge the education system if were to meet 
the challenge of educational excellence bush told the governors 
in a pep talk that opened the nations first educational conference 
between a president and the states executives 
all agreed that help is needed for a national school system 
wracked by drugs high dropout rates and mediocrity but behind 
closed doors bush and members of his cabinet heard what they did 
not want to hear that the federal governments commitment has to 
grow 
if they would give us a 5yearold that is healthy and alert 
the system would be much more productive said republican gov 
garrey carruthers of new mexico 
the summit scene was the historic campus of the university of 
virginia whose establishment was the proudest accomplishment of 
thomas jefferson americas first education president the 
university is still called mr jeffersons school and bush 
referred to it that way too 
bush dined with the governors at jeffersons famous home 
monticello atop a nearby mountain a fife and drum corps played 
and soldiers in colonial costume bearinhg the flags of the states 
lined the walkway to the main entrance where bush and his wife 
barbara stood in a receiving line that passed the diners through 
the building into the back yard 
an army band played swing tunes for the guests at rose and 
orchidbedecked tables beneath a large tent 
governors circulated a memo outlining their own goals their 
plan called for eliminating illiteracy curtailing the dropout rate 
and making american students the equal of their counterparts 
anywhere in the world especially in mathematics and science 
after the first round of meetings there was sharp and sarcastic 
criticism of some of the governors from william bennett bushs 
drug policy coordinator who served as secretary of education in the 
reagan administration 
bennett told reporters that in addition to a couple of feisty 
exchanges about education and defense spending there was pap 
standard democratic pap there was standard republican pap 
added bennett much of the discussion took place in total 
absence of any knowledge of what works or whats effective in the 
actual experience of school some people were saying things 
that other people had written for them and they were reading them 
out of books and reading them off cards 
one governor trying to make a point by comparing military and 
education spending was democrat mario cuomo of new york 
you spent over 300 billion on missiles that youll never 
fire he said in an interview on the cable news network 
addressing his remarks to the republicans now the american 
people are saying ok a few less missiles because we dont need 
them as much anymore a little more money on education i think 
the people will understand that 
carruthers of new mexico was one of several who raised the point 
about early childhood programs and said bush was urged to cut 
federal regulations 
he said the president was told at one closeddoor session let 
us do it our own way we will demonstrate that were doing it 
better 
bennett discussing that session said there was lots of talk 
about early childhood everyone agreed they like little children 
but he said that unless educators concerned themselves about 
poor schools in later grades more money for early childhood 
programs would be a waste 
its time to get on with it said bush challenging the 
governors to do more than just study the issues and to act without 
partisanship 
one plan pushed by the administration and welcomed by a number 
of governors would allow parents to shop around for schools 
sending youngsters to the ones they think will educate best 
this is a mechanism thats very very important education 
secretary lauro cavazos said in an interview ive called it the 
cornerstone for restructuring 
he said he would begin a whirlwind tour in midoctober to sell 
the idea to educators in states including north carolina colorado 
and california conducting hearings during the day and meeting with 
working parents at night 
before leaving washington bush told reporters that he was 
loking for commitment from the governors to make those 
fundamental changes that are needed if we are going to improve 
educational performance 
controversy over federal spending rumbled just below the 
surface but a number of governors said it would not be a major 
issue at the meeting bush said he was not prepared to quintuple 
spending 
gov bill clinton of arkansas a democrat conceded we do not 
expect a big increase in federal funding to flow out of this 
summit 
arriving to join his cabinet his wife and the governors in a 
day and a half of meetings bush deplored the state of the nations 
schooling 
millions of americans cannot read some never even make it to 
graduation dropping out of school and society as well he said 
drugs have invaded our classrooms violence has entered our 
schoolyards and clearly the enlightened america dreamed of by 
thomas jefferson still eludes us 
we must decide on a course of action the time for study is 
now over bush said 
a consensus appeared to form quickly around a need for 
national performance goals under which every schools 
performance could be measured against every other school in the 
country 
i think we will establish the fact that we need measurable 
national goals bush said and some governors were making the 
same point 
the summit was called in fulfillment of bushs pledge during his 
presidential campaign to become the education president 
education has taken on new urgency since then with warnings from 
businessmen that schools are not turning out graduates capable of 
competing with their foreign counterparts in japan or germany at a 
time when reasoning power becomes an ever more important onthejob 
skill 
critics cite statistics suggesting american youngsters are not 
keeping pace one study comparing us students with those of 
other countries put the americans 10th in eighthgrade arithmetic 
12th in algebra and 16th in geometry census figures show about a 
fifth of americans age 18 to 24 lack high school diplomas

two top officers at a dallas company cheated 
lied stole and covered up in an attempt to win a 400 million 
postal service contract to build mailsorting equipment a federal 
prosecutor said wednesday 
assistant us attorney joseph valder said recognition equipment 
inc its chief executive officer and marketing vice president were 
involved in a scheme to defraud the government by buying peter 
voss a former member of the postal services board of governors 
the two rei officers are william moore and robert reedy 
in opening statements at the nonjury trial the prosecutor said 
rei paid 325000 to detroitarea businessman john gnau in 1985 and 
early 1986 in an attempt to win work with the postal service 
gnau funneled some of the money to voss who as vice chairman of 
the postal board of governors had urged moore and reedy to hire 
gnau as a consultant in the fall of 1984 
rei lawyer jack cooney responded that no one at the company knew 
of the arrangement between gnau and voss 
the conspiracy between voss and gnau was up and running and 
profitable before rei was contacted said cooney rei was 
victimized rei was one of many companies this conspiracy tried to 
seduce 
but valder said the company polluted and tried to 
capture the postal service procurement process and moore was 
obsessed with getting a postal contract for the company 
moore and reedy cheated they lied they stole they 
covered up valder said 
the charges of conspiracy theft and fraud are being tried 
before us district court judge george revercomb 
moore and reedy participated in an arrangement that has been 
around since the beginning of time valder said the defendants 
were trying to buy a government official 
valder said moores own notes refer to gnaus firm at one point 
by saying consultant wired adjacent to a notation reading 
peter voss 
but the prosecutor acknowledged there will be no evidence that 
gnau voss or their associates ever specifically told rei or its 
officers of the corrupt arrangement 
valder hangs his case on words like wired which connote no 
illegality cooney said 
other companies had hired highprofile lobbyists such as former 
white house political director lyn nofziger cooney said and a 
lot of people would think those people were wired 
voss who headed ronald reagans 1980 ohio presidential 
campaign received a fouryear sentence in 1986 after pleading 
guilty to taking an illegal gratuity and to expense account fraud 
the gratuity from gnau was in connection with reis attempt to get 
postal service work 
gnau who headed reagans 1980 michigan campaign was sentenced 
to three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal 2500 gratuity 
to voss 
both men are expected to testify as government witnesses at the 
trial which could last several months 
valder said evidence will be presented showing that 
reedy asked one of gnaus business partners why dont you 
get voss to go solesource by awarding a noncompetitive 
contract to rei 
moore and reedy worked with voss through gnau associate william 
spartin to get rid of us postmaster general paul carlin and 
replace him with someone sympathetic to rei 
spartin under contract with the postal board of governors 
asked moore to suggest replacements and moores first choice was al 
casey who quickly was selected by the board 
but cooney said a tape recording of the meeting in which carlin 
was fired shows the board of governors voted 60 to dismiss him 
because he was a poor manager

israeli leftists and jewish settlers wrangled 
over the palestinian issue in a nationally televised debate 
wednesday during which settlers shunned one of their rabbis for 
meeting a palestinian activist 
the debate on israel televisions moked focus program was 
broadcast from kfar etzion in the occupied west bank after another 
settlement refused to act as host for rabbi menachem froman the 
television said 
several settler leaders refused to sit next to froman during the 
hourlong show to show their wrath over his sept 19 meeting with 
feisal husseini a palestinian jailed twice during the 21monthold 
arab uprising 
husseini is responsible for the bloodshed taking place today 
in the land of israel its improper to shake his hand said 
hanan porat a national religious party legislator 
israeli leftists often meet moderate palestinians but froman 
of tekoah settlement in the west bank is the first settler leader 
to meet a palestinian activist 
froman advocates a grassroots dialogue led by religious 
figures his ideas include a state run by israelis and palestinians 
together 
his fivehour secret conversation with husseini has split the 
70000strong settler community which mainly supports annexation 
of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
militant settlers have demanded froman be removed from his post 
at tekoah which he has held for 11 years or even jailed but some 
settler moderates said his initiative reflects a growing readiness 
to compromise 
we should fight our enemies said froman but we should 
make an effort to explore the possibility of this enemy ceasing to 
be an enemy 
but some settlers accused froman of fueling the uprising by 
meeting husseini who they said was a rebellion organizer at least 
574 arabs and 40 israelis have died in the violence 
after all those years we have some opening leftwing 
writer and journalist hanoch bartov complained and people dont 
want to hear dont want to talk dont want anything 
yohanan benyakov recalled the history of his kfar etzion 
settlement now a religious communal settlement 10 miles southwest 
of jerusalem that first was founded in 1932 and was destroyed in 
the arab riots of 1936 
reestablished in 1943 kfar etzion was besieged and destroyed 
again during israels 1948 war of independence but was founded 
anew in 1967 
the road you walk leads to a binational state now and to 
an arab state tomorrow insisted bartov who had been a guard for 
jewish convoys that brought supplies and ammunition to the area in 
1948 
we now have 2 million arabs and dont know what to do about 
them and even you are seeking a way for coexistence because the 
present situation is unbearable he said 
a settler in the audience countered to applause 
you oppose the idea of transferring arabs but support 
transfer of people from here and tekoah uprooting them from their 
place from the land 
leftwing activist avishai grossman intervened 
if we choose life and not death and suicide we should reach 
an agreement divide the land and give the palestinians a 
possibility of national expression 
israelis called in during the show to complain people like 
grossman were ready to present this beautiful state to the 
arabs on a silver plate and a palestinian phoned from gaza to 
offer a territoryforpeace exchange 
i only see jews who want peace and a state that wants peace 
noted an israeli woman calling from jerusalem but i dont see 
the palestinian side so there is no point in this debate

the senate on wednesday overwhelmingly 
approved a 94 billion plan to pay for the war on drugs and called 
for mandatory drug and alcohol testing of millions of 
transportation workers in safetysenstive jobs 
this proposal represents the strongest first step we can make 
to win the war against drugs sen robert c byrd dwva said 
as senate voted 972 to couple the drug plan to an 119 billion 
transportation bill 
the senate then passed the transportation bill 990 with the 
drug plan attached and sent it to a housesenate conference 
committee 
also included in the transportation bill is a measure last week 
that would ban smoking on all domestic airline flights 
the drug plan represented a compromise produced in weeklong 
negotiations between the white house and senators of both parties 
the negotiations began after democrats sought to add 22 
billion to the 79 billion war on drugs announced by president 
bush on sept 5 in a nationally televised address they said the 
administrations blueprint failed to earmark enough for prevention 
and treatment 
the compromise contains the 79 billion plus 400 million in 
anticrime funds 200 million for juvenile justice 800 million in 
additional prevention and treatment money and 100 million for law 
enforcement grants the additional funds would be gained through a 
043 percent cut in federal spending 
before approving the transportation bill the senate attached on 
a voice vote a provision offered by sen john c danforth to 
require drug and alcohol tests in the industry 
it would require random preemployment postaccident and 
forcause testing of an estimated 3292000 employees in 
safetysenstive positions in the airline rail bus and trucking 
industries 
danforth and a number of lawmakers have been pushing for several 
years for testing of transportation workers citing repeated fatal 
accidents traced to employees under the influence of drugs and 
alcohol a measure applying only to rail workers is part of the 
house version of the transportation bill 
the transportation department said tuesday 15352 random drug 
tests of its own employees during 16 months in 1988 and 1989 turned 
up 99 indications of drug use or 064 percent of those tested 
seventeen tests of suspected users turned up eight positive 
indications 
the central transportation provisions of the bill call for 119 
billion in new spending plus 159 billion in already collected 
fuel and passenger taxes the measure envisions 122 billion for 
highways projects 73 billion for aviation programs and 3 
billion for mass transit assistance 
smoking already is banned on domestic airline flights of two 
hours or less the senate measure would extend that to all flights 
it was adopted last week over the objections of tobaccostate 
senators 
voting against the 94 billion drug funding plan were 
republicans jake garn of utah and steve symms of idaho sen jim 
sasser dtenn did not vote not voting on the transportation 
bill was sen william armstrong rcolo 
garn said in a statement the drug plan was the result of a 
bidding war between the administration and congress over who is 
going to spend the most on drugs and the cuts required elsewhere 
would hurt valuable programs 
reaching for the advantage on the politically charged issue 
democrats took credit for reshaping the measure 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine said the bush 
administration proposal in its initial form was painfully 
inadequate for the task that we face in this country in dealing 
with drugs 
we have a chance to do something meaningful on the most 
serious domestic problem we face and we are going to take that 
action and dramatically improve the program that the president 
proposed mitchell said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the presidents 
strategy is sound we may nibble around the edges 
were not going to whip this problem in one year three years 
four years lets find out what works dole said were going 
to save a generation if we can it may take a generation to do it 
sen orrin hatch of utah one of the gop negotiators noted 
pointedly that the final addition to the program was 
substantially less than the initial amount byrd had sought 
the senate is pushing to wrap up work on money bills for the 
upcoming fiscal year once it does lawmakers plan to take up a 
bill that would put in place the nonmoney side of the war on 
drugs under an agreement between democratic and republican leaders 
the agreement also calls for the senate consideration this year 
of additional components of the longdormant bush anticrime bill 
such as extension of the death penalty to cover more offenses 
limits on the number of appeals prisoners may file and an easing of 
the rules of evidence that would favor prosecutors

the framework doesnt mandate course content which is 
determined by the states 1030 local school boards but it sets 
standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective 
as mandates 
in 1985 california education authorities drew national 
attention by successfully demanding that publishers devote more 
space to evolution the revised textbooks are now being used in 
schools across the nation 
the new proposal would strengthen the teaching of evolution 
if adopted it would be a national victory for science over 
dogma said michael hudson western states director for the 
washingtonbased people for the american way a 270000member 
advocacy group for civil and constitutional liberty issues

after 25 years of independence the 
maltese are still having trouble reconciling political differences 
that have kept them sharply divided often with bloodshed or the 
kind of turmoil that saw the armed forces cmmander thrown into the 
sea 
partisan passions generally simmer near the boiling point on the 
mediterranean island nation which has a history of foreign 
domination going back about 2000 years to the phoenicians greeks 
carthaginians romans saracens normans knights of malta french 
and british 
political disputes are fierce and often argued with firearms 
most recently the two major political parties could not get 
together to mark the anniversary of independence gained from 
britain on sept 21 1964 
socialist party leaders boycotted the celebrations on grounds 
that the governing nationalist party did not consult them about the 
plans 
national reconciliation is a muchdiscussed political issue that 
so far has remained only talk 
party rivalry is bitter enduring and often violent 
leo brincat a socialist party official maintains that the 
single biggest failure of prime minister edward fenech adamis 
2yearold conservative government is its inability to bring about 
national reconciliation 
it makes a mockery of reconciliation he said 
the nationalists in turn blame the socialists for the partisan 
fighting and for the outbreaks of political violence and 
hooliganism that it inspires 
i think the political leadership in the opposition party 
believes that an attitude of reconciliation could be considered by 
several of its followers as a capitulation said deputy prime 
minister guido de marco 
in june several hundred socialist supporters violently 
disrupted the wedding attended by the prime minister of the 
daughter of a prominent nationalist party politician 
police said 29 people were injured including 10 policemen by 
gunfire when police clashed with the crowd that shouted insults at 
the bride and pelted her with garbage and rabbit skins outside the 
church rabbit skins apparently were used because one of the prime 
ministers names fenech means rabbit in maltese 
on march 31 brig john spitieri was overpowered by a mob as he 
took the salute at the freedom day parade hit on the head with his 
ceremonial sword and tossed into the sea 
that unceremonial dunking of the armed forces commander was 
typical of the turbulent nature of politics on this rocky 
sunbaked island of 340000 people 
at least 20 people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds after 
clashes at rallies that preceeded the razorthin 1987 election 
victory for fenech adami and his conservative party one 
nationalist party activist was shot to death at a party clubhouse 
in what colleagues called a political murder 
after the election fenech adami immediately began to alter the 
course the socialists set for malta during their 16 years at the 
helm he moved the country away from the soviet union and libya and 
closer to the united states and the european economic community 
he scratched a clause from the preamble of a 1981 treaty with 
the soviet union that said malta would consult with moscow in case 
of a threat to peace and quickly scrapped part of a 1984 treaty 
with libya that called for an exchange of military and security 
information 
former maltese officials have said that a halfhour before the 
us air raids on libya in april 1986 maltese air traffic 
controllers warned libya that the warplanes were en route 
fenech adami has said malta wants to retain friendly relations 
with libya which lies 87 miles to the south and intends to 
renegotiate the 1984 friendship treaty with libya that expires in 
november but his government is looking to the west to help its 
sagging economy 
the government is seeking full membership in the european 
economic community and has liberalized its tax laws in an effort to 
lure foreign investment 
socialists complain that the conservatives are simply 
compromising maltas treasured neutrality and constitutionally 
mandated commitment to nonalignment they also assail the 
conservatives economic approach 
deputy prime minister de marco acknowledges that there has been 
no rush of foreign investment but says such things take time 
some foreign companies have come to malta but not nearly as 
many as the conservatives had hoped 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
maltese disappointment in the response stems from unrealistic 
expectations western governments he said are pleased with 
maltas new direction but in free market economies that pleasure 
does not translate directly into investment he said 
the 25 years as an independent nation have taught us many 
lessons said de marco the greatest of them all is that it is 
good to have friends but rely on yourself

environmentalists are breathing a bit 
easier here in mexicos third largest city even though noxious 
gases still spew from buses industrial smoke stains the sky 
rivers foam with waste and bulldozers uproot trees to make room for 
mansions 
in the past months authorities in the state of nuevo leon have 
taken the most serious steps toward preserving the eroding 
environment since 1939 when the 600000acre cumbres de monterrey 
national park was established in an arc west and south of the city 
ecology protection appears to be coming into vogue in 
mexico said roberto ortiz a member of the monterrey ecology 
movement theres more civic awareness and the interest of the 
authorities even by the president of mexico is more notable 
to start the state expropriated nearly 4500 acres of land on a 
pinecovered ridge called chipinque and turned it over to the 
public it was land that already supposedly belonged to the 
national park but had been parceled out to private buyers anyway 
then on aug 25 nuevo leons first ecology preservation law 
went into effect 
the law one of only three state environmental protection acts 
in the country promises to fine or close down polluting 
industries take polluting cars and buses off the road create 
waste dumps improve drainage and start environmental awareness 
programs 
local authorities were motivated by fears that monterreys 
ecological problems could reach the proportions of mexico city one 
of the most crowded and polluted cities in the world said elida 
rizzo state ecology director 
the environment just cant be ignored any longer she said 
we have do do something now or never 
but the sticking point for antipollution laws in mexico 
however wellintended has usually been enforcement 
if the ecology law is applied with the spirit in which it was 
written than theres hope said luis sepulveda a member of the 
environmental group long live chipinque but if its compromised 
by politics then itll end up like all the other laws in mexico 
that were made to be violated 
a chief problem is mexicos poverty antipollution efforts are 
not the top priority for officials focused on creating jobs and 
restarting an economy that has been stagnant for six years 
we dont want there to be a witch hunt against us said 
armando rodriguez legal director for the monterrey chamber of 
industry if the government acts drastically it could close maybe 
50 percent of the plants in monterrey 
about 150 miles south of texas rio grande valley monterrey is 
northern mexicos largest most industrialized and wealthiest city 
nearly 3 million people live in the metropolitan area about 75 
percent of nuevo leons population 
at one time it also was one of the norths most beautiful 
communities nestled in the shadows of 7500foot peaks and 
bisected by the rippling santa catarina river 
but rapid industrialization and urbanization monterrey had 
just 130000 residents in 1930 helped turn the santa catarina 
into a dusty channel as demands for its water increased 
ecology director rizzo said monterrey households create nearly 
900000 tons of garbage a year industry produces 15 million tons 
of waste annually much of it toxic but the state got its first 
industrial waste dump just last year 
mexico has had several federal environmental protection laws 
the newest 7 months old and president carlos salinas de gortari 
has promised a serious fight against the problem in mexico city 
new rules requiring that vehicles stay off the road one working day 
in five are due to go into effect nov 1 
but while lead emissions are a major cause of air pollution in 
the cities cars still use leaded gasoline 
ecologists lauded the seizure of chipinque 
the expropriation indicates that at least an effort is being 
made to save what nature gave us said sepulveda 
the nuevo leon law said rizzo gives us more power and allows 
us to take quicker action 
the new law gives the state the power to levy fines of up to 
20000 times the daily minimum wage now about 350 a day and 
prison terms of up to five years so far no enforcement action has 
been taken as the state organizes an environmental commission and 
prepares impact studies 
two major polluters an oil refinery and the power authority 
are owned by the federal government but rizzo promises the state 
law will be enforced against all polluters and will show 
positive results within five years

tax reform is an idea whose time has come and 
gone with some frequency right now it is going piece by piece 
as congress works toward reviving tax breaks the reformers scrapped 
as loopholes just three years ago 
the rival tax plans that are being pushed by republicans and 
democrats each involve tax preferences that were eliminated in the 
1986 law that was to have been the landmark of lasting reform 
there had been some tinkering but now the proposals for change 
involve major features of the law president reagan hailed as the 
prize in the world series of tax reform 
one is the capital gains tax break president bush campaigned 
for and squeezed through the house ways and means committee with 
the help of democrats who broke with their partys leaders the 
other is an acrosstheboard deduction for individual retirement 
accounts ruled out for upper income taxpayers under the 1986 
overhaul now the democratic counter to the bush plan 
the tax issue is one of the few that really was presented to the 
voters in the campaign of 1988 in bushs daily promises that there 
would be no increase and in his call for reduction of the tax on 
capital gains realized from the sale of stocks real estate and 
other assets he said that would spur investment and help create 
jobs then as now the democrats denounced the proposal as a tax 
break for the rich 
in congress democratic leaders argue that the measure to reduce 
the tax on capital gains undoes one of the central compromises that 
opened the way for enactment of the tax reform act of 1986 
rep richard a gephardt of missouri the house majority leader 
said the essential tradeoff was that tax deductions and tax breaks 
like the lower rate for capital gains were dropped in exchange for 
reductions in income tax rates he said the republicans now want to 
keep the rates but restore one of the tax breaks 
the bill they now favor would reduce the effective capital gains 
tax to a maximum 196 percent for the next two years which is just 
about where it was before the 1986 tax bill eliminated special 
treatment for capital gains and made it subject to income tax rates 
which now range up to 33 percent 
that strikes at the heart of tax reform gephardt said 
then again the individual retirement account deduction was 
restricted as part of the same tax reform deal one of the 1986 
changes was to eliminate that deduction for taxpayers whose joint 
returns showed income over 50000 a year 
so while the democrats complain that bush wants a tax break for 
the rich most of direct benefits of either proposal would go to 
people high on the income ladder 
democrats want to finance the retirement account deduction by 
boosting the top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers to 33 percent 
that would affect about 600000 taxpayers who now pay top rates of 
28 percent although people with slightly lower incomes already are 
at the higher rate bush says that would be a tax increase and hed 
veto it in keeping with his campaign vow 
either formula runs counter to the premise of the 1986 reformers 
that tax laws should be written to raise revenues rather than to 
determine how people use their own money that and the drive to 
keep total revenues at their prereform levels while rates were 
being slashed led to the wholesale elimination of tax deductions 
and shelters 
the next step in the cycle it seems is to start putting some 
back 
as the process unfolds lines are being drawn on an issue that 
will resound in the 1990 congressional election campaigns as it 
has in the last four presidential elections 
the democrats only won one with jimmy carter who said his 
advocacy of tax reform was one of the reasons he won in 1976 
carter campaigned for a complete overhaul of the income tax system 
calling it a disgrace to the human race in the next three 
elections republican candidates used the tax issue effectively in 
defeating democrats they said were bent on raising taxes 
thats a script republicans hope to use again in state and 
congressional elections

middleaged person makes early withdrawals 
from ira and pays no penalty 
maybe that will never make it as a headline at the supermarket 
checkout stand but it is a feat that can be accomplished in real 
life quite possible to your financial benefit without breaking 
the law 
as millions of americans opened individual retirement accounts 
in recent years they were cautioned that they were tying up their 
money until the year in which they reached age 59 
any withdrawals from the account before then except in cases of 
death or disability are hit with a 10 percent penalty tax in 
addition to ordinary income tax 
however there is a littleknown poorly understood exception 
to this rule says the accounting firm of kpmg peat marwick 
people of any age can withdraw money from an ira provided they 
do so under a system that provides for roughly equal periodic 
payments based on their life expectancies 
to see how this works in practice consider this example 
provided by accountants deloitte haskins amp sells 
a 50yearold woman wants to start tapping a 250000 ira in 
which she has stashed a lumpsum payment from a former employer 
she consults the current tables published by the internal 
revenue service available at her library perhaps or her bank 
and determines that her statistical life expectancy is 331 years 
dividing 250000 by 331 she calculates that she can withdraw 
7553 this year subject to income taxes but no penalty 
when it comes time to make next years withdrawal she will 
recompute how much she is entitled to based on the remaining 
balance in her ira and the latest lifeexpectancy tables 
chances are the balance will be a bit more than 250000 then 
since she withdrew only about 3 percent of her money this year and 
can easily earn a higher interest rate on the remaining amount in 
the account 
if she wants to gain access to more money in the early years of 
her withdrawals she can figure what is coming to her using an 
annuity formula that also is based on life expectancy but adds 
an assumed future return on the capital she has invested 
with an assumed return of 9 percent she is entitled to a 
penaltyfree distribution of about 24000 this year 
once you commit yourself to either approach you must keep using 
it faithfully until you reach age 59 or more and have been taking 
the distributions for at least five years 
fail to meet this requirement and you are subject to something 
called a recapture tax that amounts to a reimposition of all 
the penalties you thought you had avoided 
now that you know how to do it is it time to rush out and start 
mining your ira gold not without some careful consideration 
financial advisers say 
as a general rule most individuals should leave their ira 
balances intact at least until retirement kpmg peat marwick says 
after all the point of most ira saving is to accumulate a nest 
egg specifically for the later years of your life when you may 
have less control over your financial circumstances than you did 
before 
furthermore the earlier you withdraw money from an ira the 
less time it has to enjoy the potent benefits of taxdeferred 
compounding 
but the early withdrawal strategy may have appeal in special 
situations for example when you feel your retirement can be 
secured from other sources and you see an opportunity to put your 
ira money to work elsewhere and it remains as an option for all 
ira savers should their needs change with time

you dont have to have inside information or 
economic insight to get a clear concise and probably accurate 
forecast of where the economy is going over the next few months 
just watch automobile sales 
in order to benefit you dont have to have plans to buy a car 
although discounts would indeed leave more money in your pocket 
consider any discount a bonus and continue to watch the direction 
of car sales in general 
should sales rise strongly it could mean the economy has a 
reserve of strength the federal reserve had not foreseen those 
higher sales could carry the economy for several months they also 
might force borrowing costs higher 
if sales lag it would suggest an economy still cooling down 
and with recession always a threat the lower sales might spur the 
federal reserve into allowing interest rates to fall thus giving a 
lift to economic activity 
the situation isnt unique car sales always are important 
being the biggest item in a consumer market that accounts for 
twothirds of the gross national product but now those sales are 
playing an unusually critical role 
will sales continue strong as they have for several years or 
will they decline not even carmakers can say but already they 
have signaled their anxiety general motors has announced discounts 
on its upcoming 1990 models and others might follow 
never before has a company the size of gm raised prices on 
products to be introduced and then discounted prices on those 
products before they reached the market 
that is how uncertain the car market is and maybe the consumer 
economy too 
should sales weaken carmakers would be in a fix they might be 
forced to discount more deeply and if that failed they would be 
forced into layoffs eventually suppliers would have to do the 
same 
the impact would be huge the effect of car sales penetrates the 
entire economy eventually showing up in areas that might seem to 
have only a remote connection 
that impact spreads through categories of industry wholesale 
and retail textiles metals mining plastics chemicals rubber 
oil through all levels of labor white collar blue collar 
skilled unskilled and through every geographic region bar none 
that is why car sales are a measure of consumer sentiment and an 
indicator of economic direction they involve every residence from 
the white house to your house 
seldom however are they afforded the high recognition of 
stocks as an indicator of future economic developments stocks it 
is said foretell the economy six months in advance and there is 
some supporting evidence 
the big problem with the stock market however is that it has 
evolved from a random selection of economic sentiment to a 
marketplace dominated by likethinking institutional buyers it can 
give false signals 
perhaps the most notorious of these alarms was the price 
collapse of october 1987 bringing with it dire warnings of a 
recession to come that didnt come 
researchers found a telling reason why too few americans owned 
stocks and therefore werent affected directly in the pocketbook 
many of them didnt even follow the market 
the same isnt true of car sales

not satisfied with extended weekday hours 
saturday hours and automated tellers open 24 hours some banks are 
crossing the onceunthinkable financial frontier of sunday hours 
its well under way in atlanta and by november at least two 
california banks plan to offer full service on sundays from new 
accounts to home equity lines of credit most of the branches will 
be located in a common sunday stopping place supermarkets 
a smattering of other banks have also tried sunday hours the 
latest strategy in a trend toward greater flexibility that began 
with bank deregulation a decade ago 
since deregulation banks have courted customers with everything 
from free toasters to interestbearing checking accounts to 
saturday hours 
weekend banking is acknowledging the fact that life in the 
80s aint as simple as a couple of decades ago said nancy 
evans spokeswoman for the california bankers association 
banks are finally learning they will have to be retailers 
theyve been too conservative said jack seefus president and 
chief executive of the sixbranch antelope valley bank in the 
desert 60 miles north of los angeles 
all seefus branches already are open from 9 to 1 on saturdays 
and they will stay open from 11 to 3 sundays beginning in november 
a boon to the booming population of people who work in los angeles 
but live in distant cities like lancaster and palmdale where 
housing is cheaper 
the demographics have changed so much these commuters have 
got to have a place to bank and they dont pull into town until 6 
or 630 seefus said 
this is just another type of convenience were providing for 
people agreed michael wallace executive vice president at 
eightbranch fremont bank near san francisco 
fremont has had saturday hours at its regular branches for 20 
years it plans to open eight more that will be open from 11 to 5 
on sunday beginning with two in november 
both banks are small fremont has 220 million in assets 
antelope valley has 112 million 
and both will tie their sunday hours into another emerging 
banking trend branches at supermarkets the eight new fremont 
branches will be built inside safeway stores in cities along the 
east side of san francisco bay 
two antelope valley bank minibranches are already located in 
markets and seefus hopes to add more 
its a very inexpensive way to expand your operations he 
said 
people think only the consumer will use a bank like that in a 
market seefus said but thats not true businesses use those 
little banks too the k mart in mojave uses us they come over to 
the stater brothers market and do their banking 
seefus wont be surprised if californias bigger banks 
eventually open at least some branches on sunday to keep their 
smaller rivals from taking away customers 
elsewhere in the country georgias bank south 75 branches 5 
billion in assets has tried sunday banking over the past year at 
its 31 branches in big kroger stores in the atlanta area 
it has been very successful said spokesman bolling bo 
spalding 
we were primarily a corporate bank and now were trying to 
build a retail presence spalding said we want to do that by 
differentiating ourselves being the most convenient bank in 
atlanta 
like fremont bank bank south builds its offices into the front 
of the supermarket they stay open seven days a week until 8 pm 
beginning at 10 am monday through saturday and 1 pm on sundays 
the advantage is the relatively low overhead both in building 
the branches and staffing them spalding said we have two or 
three people in a supermarket branch compared to 10 or 12 in a 
regular branch 
the reason that makes sense for us and the customers is that 
sunday is krogers secondbusiest day of the week behind 
saturday 
sunday banking suits peoples lifestyles better he said 
with twoincome families both people working they cant meet 
the banks traditional hours 
savings and loans traditionally more sensitive to retail 
customers have experimented with sunday hours over the years they 
include western savings amp loan association in arizona which has 
branches in 24 smittys markets in the phoenix area which are open 
from 8 to 7 on sundays and 8 to 9 on saturdays 
but finding banks willing to stay open on sunday has been very 
rare said virginia stafford a spokeswoman for the american 
bankers association in washington 
still she suggests that may change at least in some places 
banks are being much more aggressive about drawing customers 
these days ms stafford said 
they are making branches more attractive figuring out ways of 
attracting customers rather than just waiting for them to walk in 
selling bank services like you would sell other retail services or 
products

albert campion often acts like a superficial 
flippant twit but what can you expect from a detective who says 
hes a specialist in fairy tales 
hes fairly hard to fathom said peter davison the english 
actor who plays the 1930s sleuth in a new series called campion 
kicking off the fall season for pbs mystery davison was 
formerly doctor who and appeared in all creatures great and 
small 
people think he doesnt take things seriously or doesnt 
understand whats going on its really a device to keep suspects 
off guard he wears little round horn rim glasses weve decided 
those probably arent real and are just part of the image too 
the series is adapted from the books by british crime writer 
margery allingham a peer of agatha christie and dorothy l sayers 
the new mystery season opens thursday with campion and 
the introduction of diana rigg as host in place of departing 
vincent price 
campion is himself a bit of a mystery 
hes a slightly enigmatic figure and its not made clear in 
the books what hes really about said davison hes the 
youngest son of a duke whos gone off to seek adventure in the 
1930s it was the practice to send the youngest son off to the 
colonies but he didnt want to do that and set himself up as a 
private detective 
his righthand man is a big baldheaded exconvict named 
magersfontein lugg hes given up his criminal activities but hes 
a source of priceless information for campion albert campions not 
his real name someone calls him christopher twelvetrees and 
someone else calls him orlando hes obviously a gentleman and well 
mannered and is equally at home with the aristocracy or criminals 
and gypsies 
there are four campion stories each told in two weekly 
episodes brian glover is lugg and andrew burt is inspector 
stanislaus oates of scotland yard 
british critics have said the major strength of the campion 
books were the outrageous plots and their many twists the opening 
story of the case of the late pig is about how campion 
investigates the murder of a friend months after attending the 
friends funeral the pigs death turns out to be a clue 
davison said allingham wrote some of the books as cerebral 
exercises and some as ripping yarns so there will be a mixture in 
the series she also peopled her books with a lot of americans but 
some of have been taken out a main character in the first show was 
changed from american to a scot 
most of the stories take place in england although one is set 
on a cruise ship an opening scene in the french riviera in one 
show was changed to avoid a costly trip to france to film just one 
scene 
davison grew up in south london and began acting in an 
afterschool drama club i thought id have a go at it he 
said i never did well academically it was always a lastminute 
scramble to put things together so i went to drama school instead 
of university i worked in a dry cleaners and a factory and was a 
hospital orderly before starting school 
davison married about 10 years to american actress sandra 
dickinson has an apartment in los angeles they met at the central 
school of speech and drama where both attended 
i dont think we ever said a word to each other in school 
he said i was aware of her but we were in different years then 
we did a rock musical version of a midsummer nights dream at the 
edinburgh festival sandra has become quite well known in england 
davison said he never trained for a second career in case acting 
didnt work out

marisa blay was content as a wife 
mother and homemaker until a dream changed her life and led her to 
become a guardian of some of the youngest and mostabused victims 
of aids 
in my dream i was in heaven and god told me i was going to 
hell because he had given me so much and i had never helped anybody 
in return she says 
the result is a nonprofit charity called proyecto amor or 
project love puerto ricos first home for newborns and toddlers 
who are not only infected with the aids virus but also have been 
battered neglected or abandoned 
i want the kids nobody wants mrs blay says 
she and her husband jorge who owns a swimming pool 
construction company used their savings to buy an 85000 house 
and halfacre lot for proyecto amor in the san juan suburb of rio 
piedras local businesses civic groups and individual donors 
provided paint furniture clothes and toys 
after months of untangling red tape with the health authorities 
the home which mrs blay runs with an assistant eight nurses and 
two cooks finally opened in july 
proyecto amor is a cheery bungalow surrounded by palms and 
broadleafed tropical plants with a swing set a slide and monkey 
bars in the back yard the rooms are airy and freshly painted the 
closets bulge with little dresses and shirts bright new cribs sit 
in tidy rows in the three bedrooms 
this is my bed 4yearold hilario says proudly hurrying 
over to a crib where he has left his teddy bears from the night 
before 
hilario carmen 3 and margarita 11 months were the first 
children brought to proyecto amor their names are changed here at 
mrs blays request 
twelve more children including a newborn whose drugaddict 
mother walked away from her in the hospital are expected in the 
coming months 
the project love home escaped serious damage from hurricane 
hugo but the children were temporarily moved out when the 
electricity was knocked out 
puerto rico with a population of 33 million is experiencing 
one of the most serious aids epidemics in the western world since 
1982 there have been 2940 reported cases of aids and authorities 
estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus 
mrs blay met carmen on a visit with her church group to a 
shelter for battered children at the age of 4 months carmen had 
been left alone in an apartment with two toddler brothers for about 
five days 
she was undernourished and had pneumonia and a fungal infection 
blood tests determined that she was hivpositive a carrier of the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
police picked up hilario at the age of 2 wandering the streets 
of old san juan the capitals historic district his mother was a 
chronic drug abuser and he was found to be an aids carrier 
he was brought to the same hospital where carmen was staying

food medicine and a 5000 monthly staff payroll mrs blay says 
the blays who have two young children of their own retain 
title to the proyecto amor property and pay taxes and utility 
charges even though they do not live there mrs blay says they 
plan to build on more rooms if necessary and did not want to ever 
give up ownership for fear it would become too much like an 
institution 
i want it to work as a home full of love for these kids as 
long as they last she says 
hilario carmen and margarita all appear healthy now but 
medical statistics are stacked against them mrs blay says she is 
trying to prepare herself emotionally for their deaths 
i know that they have a sickness that will one day bring their 
lives to an end she says but i have faith they are going to 
last a long time

mao tsetung the revolutionary forefather of a 
communist china that now craves stability rather than revolution 
has become a figure of the past 
maos portrait still hangs imposingly from tiananmen gate just 
below the rostrum from where he declared the birth of a new china 
40 years ago 
on the opposite side of tiananmen square his preserved body has 
been viewed by more than 50 million people since the mausoleum 
opened 12 years ago mao died sept 9 1976 
a few mao statues still stand in provincial capitals although a 
fourstory landmark at beijing university was torn down last year 
weathered photos of the great helmsman as he was called 
occasionally adorn the walls of peasants homes 
but for most chinese mao has little relevance in a country that 
has undergone vast changes over the past 40 years 
under deng xiaoping a prominent victim of maos purges chinese 
historians have judged mao a revolutionary hero who in his later 
years made serious mistakes 
his great leap forward the disastrous 1958 plunge into rapid 
industrialization and 196676 cultural revolution are high on a 
list of blunders now attributed to him 
the communist partys history research center concluded last 
year that maos ideological system is basically divorced from the 
realities in china and is thus incorrect 
mao buttons appeared during democracy demonstrations this past 
spring in some cities and marching workers carried portraits of 
mao but these gestures appeared to be more a slam at corruption 
among todays bureaucrats unlike the old revolutionaries who took 
pride in their honesty and simple lives 
more in evidence are portraits and references to the late 
premier chou enlai who remains universally beloved among chinese 
the conservatives in power since the june crackdown on dissent 
have stressed the importance of maos thought as well as the ideas 
of marx and lenin but no attempt has been made to reappraise maos 
role in history 
a new movie of maos revolutionary exploits has come out in time 
for the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the communist 
takeover of china but it is unlikely to inspire many to dig out 
their little red books of mao quotations as people did during 
the cultural revolution

if life begins at conception does 
that mean a fetus cannot be jailed or that someone can add nine 
months to his age to avoid being convicted of underage drinking 
some missouri attorneys are asking such questions after the us 
supreme court upheld key portions of the states 1986 abortion law 
legal experts say the lawyers are limited only by their imagination 
at issue is the laws preamble that says the life of each human 
begins at conception it also says a fetus has the rights 
privileges and immunities available to other persons citizens and 
residents of the state 
in its july ruling the supreme court did not strike down the 
preamble saying it was not unconstitutional because it has no 
enforceable restrictions on abortions it also said state courts 
must decide how it applies to other missouri laws 
since the supreme court ruling some lawyers have started using 
the lifebeginsatconception argument for other issues 
for instance 
a us district court lawsuit contends a fetus is illegally 
imprisoned because the mother is an inmate at a state prison it 
argues the fetus is not charged with a crime convicted or 
sentenced attorney michael box who filed the suit said if 
life begins at conception then fetuses are supposed to be like 
anyone else theyre a person and they have constitutional 
rights 
a 20yearold columbia man charged with driving while 
intoxicated and possession of alcohol by a minor claimed the 
states law against underage drinking does not apply to him he 
said the lifebeginsatconception doctrine adds nine months to his 
life making him 21 missouris legal drinking age a trial judge 
disagreed but the mans attorney daniel dodson plans to appeal 
antiabortion protesters in st louis were acquitted of 
trespassing charges from sitin demonstrations at an abortion 
clinic they argued they were trying to save lives by preventing 
abortions the judge agreed citing the preamble previously 
another st louis judge used the same legal logic to find other 
protesters innocent of trespassing in a similar case 
while such arguments are inventive legal authorities say they 
still must show legal merit to prevail 
i think you are going to have to make a close relationship 
between the abortion statute and whatever other statute the court 
or the attorneys are trying to apply said timothy heinsz dean 
of the university of missouricolumbia school of law the 
argument is limited only by the creative mind of the attorney 
michael boicourt the assistant attorney general who helped 
defend the abortion law said the preamble doesnt create any 
rights or privileges for fetuses and merely states legislative 
policy he said its main effect will be in property rights 
personal injury and criminal law cases 
i dont think the preamble will ever be interpreted by the 
courts to create a ridiculous result boicourt said 
referring to attempts to apply the preamble language to the 
underage driving and similar cases he added these cases arent 
serious they are interesting to the public but they arent 
legally serious 
state rep sue shear has asked attorney general william webster 
for an opinion on whether the preamble affects various state laws 
involving age requirements webster argued the case before the 
supreme court 
ms shear said she sought the nonbinding opinion because she 
thought lawyers would have a heyday with the preamble and it 
needed to be resolved websters office says it is researching the 
issue 
louis defeo executive director of the missouri catholic 
conference said many of the issues could be raised under other 
state laws and court decisions 
the rights of unborn children didnt originate with this 
said defeo a lawyer and one of the laws authors lawsuits can 
be filed and claims recovered trusts and property can go to unborn 
children there is nothing new with the law recognizing the rights 
of the unborn 
in an unrelated tennessee case a judge ruled recently that 
life begins at conception and awarded temporary custody of 
seven frozen embryos to a woman who is divorcing her husband the 
husband plans to appeal but legal authorities have said the 
decision that embryos are persons might lead to inheritance 
disputes or prompt invitro fertilization doctors to fear murder 
charges if implanted embryos fail to come to term 
st louis attorney frank susman who argued against the missouri 
law before the supreme court said he warned that the ramifications 
would be unknown and numerous 
the law he said demonstrates the total absurdity of what the 
legislature did and of not having thought things through on a piece 
of legislation 
as to whether attorneys have any legal basis in some of the 
cases susman said it seems they do the language suggests that 
you are a person from the moment of conception 
others say the publicity from the case has drawn lawyers 
attention to the lifebeginatconception argument 
its almost like the supreme court put its stamp of appoval on 
it by not striking it down and that makes it easier to utilize 
said st louis attorney andrew puzder who came up with the idea of 
the preamble 
even so puzder questioned some of the arguments including the 
imprisoned fetus lawsuit 
its a silly issue whether an unborn child has a right to be 
where the mother isnt that can never be the legitimate issue is 
the quality of prenatal care and that is a legitimate issue with 
or without this statute he said 
puzder said the underage drinking case lacks merit because state 
law says a persons age is calculated from the time they are born 
this law was never intended to change the time by which you 
compute a persons age by their date of birth he said nobody 
has the right to have that date moved up or back nothing that says 
life begins at conception changes how the state computes age 
the question of when life begins already has been addessed for 
tax purposes by state revenue director duane benton after the 
courts ruling some questioned whether a fetus could be claimed as 
a state tax deduction 
but benton a tax lawyer decided the answer was no he said 
missouris tax law adopts provisions of the federal tax code which 
say an unborn child is not a person for the purpose of a personal 
exemption

the head of the world bank responding to 
longstanding criticism pledged tuesday that his agency would make 
protection of the earths resources a top priority in the 1990s 
in the coming decade it will be impossible to improve the 
quality of life in developing and industrial countries alike unless 
we do much more to conserve our global environment world bank 
president barber conable said in his opening address to the annual 
meetings of the world bank and the international monetary fund 
over the years environmental groups have attacked both 
international lending organizations for ignoring the environmental 
threats posed by the loans they made to the third world for such 
projects as hydroelectric dams roads and other development 
projects 
last years annual meeting in west berlin was disrupted on the 
opening day by thousands of environmental protestors 
conable told the delegates from 152 nations that his agency is 
striving to improve in this area by building environmental impact 
assessments into its loan review process and by boosting its 
monetary support to address such key environmental threats as 
depletion of tropical rain forests ocean pollution and global 
warming from the excessive use of fossil fuels 
in addition to global pollution the finance officials were 
reviewing such issues as the third world debt crisis the political 
upheaval in eastern europe and the efforts needed to keep huge 
trade imbalances from derailing the global economic expansion 
the us delegation led by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
continued to push forward with its debtreductioninitiative which 
seeks to trim poor countries debt burden by using imf and world 
bank resources to spur debt forgiveness on the part of commercial 
banks 
president bush met with 65 leading bankers and other 
international leaders at the white house to solicit support for the 
brady plan 
the administration got good news tuesday when venezuelan 
planning minister miguel rodriguez fandeo indicated that his 
country was backing away from its demand that commercial banks 
provide the nation with a 50 percent debt reduction a demand the 
banks had dismissed as completely unreasonable 
while the negotiations are continuing rodriguez said a group of 
15 banks has indicated it would provide venezuela with a shortterm 
loan of 600 million to allow the country to catch up on late 
interest payments 
the remarkable political changes under way in eastern europe 
were also under review at the annual meetings polish finance 
minister leszek balcerowicz held discussions this week with brady 
to outline the proposals his new government the first in eastern 
europe to be led by noncommunists was considering adopting to 
restructure the countrys crippled economy 
president bushs speech to the finance ministers wednesday will 
touch on the need for the west to provide financial support for the 
historic reforms underway in the communist bloc according to 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
other countries have also made international aid to poland and 
hungary top priorities with many officials saying the imf and the 
world bank need to focus expanded resources during the next decade 
toward the goal of integrating the communist world into the global 
economy 
in his opening speech imf managing director michel camdessus 
called this development complex and historically unprecedented 
and said many of the communist nations needed to better address the 
high rates of inflation plaguing their nations 
fitzwater said that the administration was sympathetic to the 
need for more funds being sought by the world bank and the imf to 
meet its growing responsibilities but that we havent made 
judgments yet about the amounts of aid 
finance officials from the worlds seven richest countries 
continued their efforts tuesday to push the dollar lower on foreign 
currency markets as a way of addressing americas huge trade 
deficit 
currency traders reported that major central banks intervened 
numerous times during the day to sell dollars as the banks 
continued to back up a joint statement by the group of seven 
nations on saturday that a further rise in the dollars value 
represented a threat to the world economy 
the efforts managed to drive the dollar lower in trading in 
tokyo and london but the dollar rose slightly against the yen in 
new york to 14235 still down significantly from the 146yen 
level of just last friday 
referring to the environment french finance minister pierre 
beregovoy said he believed the rich nations should voluntarily 
provide more money to the world bank for environmental problems he 
said france was prepared to contribute 140 million toward a goal 
of creating an environmental fund of 125 billion 
brady in his speech at the opening session called it essential 
for the world bank to be guided by the principle that development 
and environmental protection must go hand in hand but brady 
offered no proposal to boost world bank resources for this purpose 
the worlds richest countries also addressed environmental 
problems at this years economic summit in paris in his remarks 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said his country was 
moving forward with commitments made in paris to provide 21 
billion over three years to support conservation efforts in the 
third world 
in addition to the environment conable said the third world 
must trim the 200 billion it spends annually on defense if it 
expects to end its prolonged debt problems 
conable said developing countries are devoting 20 percent of 
their government spending to defense and in the mid1980s military 
costs exceeded the amounts third world nations were devoting to 
health and education combined 
let us hope that in the changing political climate of the 
1990s resources are increasingly allocated to more productive 
purposes in industrial countries as well as developing 
countries conable said

anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith says 
the defensive restructuring proposed by bat industries plc is 
welcome but wont deter his hostile 22 billion bid for the british 
conglomerate 
bat on tuesday announced plans to sell its us retailing 
businesses spin off other operations and buy back 10 percent of 
its stock to enhance the value of its shares 
later in the day goldsmith characterized bats plan a first 
step to the unbundling plan he has proposed through his 
hoylake investments ltd takeover bid he said hoylake would vote 
its shares in favor of it 
the restructuring wouldnt mean he would be willing to give up 
the takeover bid which has been suspended while it overcomes us 
regulatory hurdles he said 
analysts said bats proposal would enhance the british 
conglomerates stock price and was likely to be approved by 
shareholders but they said hoylake could come back later and bid 
for what is left of bat 
bat said it would reshape itself to concentrate on its tobacco 
business which is a steady cash generator and its fastgrowing 
financial services operations this would be a significant 
departure from its previous strategy of gradually diversifying away 
from tobacco 
hoylake consisting of goldsmith british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild australian entrepreneur kerry packer and other 
investors has proposed restructuring bat by selling off all its 
nontobacco interests 
bat said the businesses it would retain were expected to account 
for 80 percent of its forecast 1989 pretax profit of 32 billion 
the us retailing operations that would be sold include 46 saks 
fifth avenue stores and 24 marshall fields stores the two chains 
have combined annual sales of 2 billion 
these and other planned smaller disposals could fetch 24 
billion analysts said 
bat said it would create two new publicly held companies by 
giving its existing stockholders shares in its british retailing 
company argos as well as shares in a combination of its paper 
companies wiggins teape and appleton 
bat said it would buy back 10 percent of its shares which would 
cost the equivalent of 2 billion at tuesdays closing price 
it also pledged to significantly increase its dividends the 
total dividend for 1989 could go as high as the equivalent of 48 
cents a 49 percent increase over the previous year bat said 
its a useful start nigel utley an analyst with laing and 
cruickshank said of bats plan it will enhance shareholder 
value but not necessarily enough to defeat a serious bid 
andrew mitchell an analyst with the london investment firm 
smith new court plc said it does seem likely that they 
shareholders would approve these proposals because it gives them 
a bird in the hand 
bat called a special oct 19 shareholders meeting to vote on the 
measures 
bat shares rose the equivalent of 3 cents to close tueday at 
1317 on londons stock exchange they were up more than 81 cents 
earlier in the day 
hoylake has suspended its offer of 1414 in debt securities for 
each bat share while us state insurance commissioners review its 
proposed change of ownership of bats farmers insurance group inc 
of los angeles 
in a telephone interview with apdow jones news service 
goldsmith said the point is that theyve bat made a first 
step in the direction of realizing a higher share value which is 
the basis of the hoylake argument

estimated at 150 million churchs and popeyes will operate under 
al copeland enterprises with offices in new orleans and san antonio 
paul hargett senior vice president of finance for the merged 
companies said chicken lovers will continue to have a choice 
between churchs and popeyes although there will be areas of the 
country where we will have conversions from one chain to the 
other 
a total of 150 churchs stores were closed and are being sold 
for real estate value hargett said 
in an attempt to wipe away some of churchs red ink the company 
plans to emphasize franchised stores rather than companyowned 
stores within the churchs division 
the real crux of the matter is we have half a billion dollars 
worth of debt said hargett who was with churchs and is staying 
on after the merger 
churchs had 1107 company stores and 361 franchises compared 
with 101 popeyes company stores and 618 popeyes franchises 
by years end the company aims to operate 801 churchs company 
stores and have 371 franchises while running 150 popeyes company 
stores and 643 franchises 
churchs stores averaged an annual sales volume of 420000 
each far short of the 750000 annual sales volume averaged by 
popeyes stores 
so we are concentrating a lot on these stores that fit the 
demographics of the popeyes profile hargett said 
what is that profile 
a proxy statement to shareholders says popeyes restaurants 
have experienced significantly higher per unit sales in suburban 
and middleincome urban locations than have churchs restaurants 
meanwhile churchs has targeted primarily urban blue collar 
customers including those in the ethnic and minority segments of 
the population the proxy states 
the company is experimenting with a new churchs look that 
includes more space and brighter colors menu changes also are in 
order churchs already has introduced a new type of biscuit and 
will be selling a new southernstyle fried chicken 
also according to the proxy statement the past churchs policy 
of big pieces little prices was ineffective contributing to a 
decline in revenue consumers can expect a backing away from that 
strategy as churchs stops buying larger chickens and tries to 
reduce its perpiece cost it also plans to raise some prices 
not everyone is predicting a smooth ride for churchs and 
popeyes 
ernie renaud former president and chief executive officer of 
churchs said placating popeyes franchisees will be the biggest 
obstacle 
you expect to be given 110 percent by the franchiser to help 
make sure you succeed renaud said its like going to a doctor 
and finding out hes got too many patients and cant do right by 
you how he copeland handles his franchisees is going to be 
the key to his success 
howard hansen an analyst with kidder peabody amp co who follows 
the fastfood industry said that while churchs and popeyes are 
settling in to their new relationship archrival kentucky fried 
chicken will continue opening stores 
catching kentucky fried chicken a unit of pepsico inc will be 
a long race for copeland enterprises hansen said its like 
burger king trying to catch up with mcdonalds 
greg reynolds kfcs vice president for public affairs said he 
is hesitant to criticize competitors but proclaims that his company 
plans to stay on top 
kentucky fried chicken feels a bigger threat from more 
mainstream fastfood companies such as mcdonalds which are 
introducing new chicken dishes he said 
clearly the market for chicken is out there

the labor department announced plans to fine 
chevron usa inc 877000 for 114 safety violations in 
connection with a richmond calif refinery fire last spring in 
which three workers were severely burned 
the great tragedy of these injuries is that they were 
avoidable labor secretary elizabeth dole said tuesday in 
announcing the findings of the departments occupational safety and 
health administration which inspected the refinery after the 
accident 
the safety agency concluded that chevron was aware that workers 
responsible for assisting firefighters should have had protective 
equipment and clothing it said individual refinery workers and 
union officials have been requesting protective equipment for 
several years but the company saw no need for it 
the company failed to provide even this most fundamental basic 
equipment mrs dole said 
jeff krag a chevron spokesman at the refinery said the company 
had not finished reviewing the proposed labor department fines but 
on initial glance saw flaws in oshas analysis of the accident 
he said the company would appeal the penalties 
the company has 15 days to contest the fines in administrative 
proceedings before the department makes them final 
the safety agency determined that the april 10 fire began when a 
pipe carrying highly pressurized hydrogen gas separated at a weld 
the resulting fire and explosion weakened an adjacent reactor 
which fell and engulfed four workers in flames 
three who were wearing no fireresistant clothing received 
second and thirddegree burns over as much as 70 percent of their 
bodies from hot oil 
the fourth worker a firefighter escaped with minor first and 
seconddegree burns on his face because he wore fireresistant 
clothing that covered the rest of his body the dpartment said 
five other workers suffered less serious injuries

the house banking committee has voted to strip 
the treasury departments authority over lowinterest loans and 
loan guarantees to third world countries for buying hightech goods 
or construction services from us companies 
on a 2822 vote tuesday the committee effectively turned that 
authority over to the exportimport bank as part of a bill raising 
its tiedaid war chest by 200 million and imposing new 
environmental conditions on us approval of world bank and 
international monetary fund aid to underdeveloped countries 
us manufacturers have complained that the treasury in its 
effort to deter the use of such tiedaid packages by other other 
countries chiefly japan and france has been too tightfisted in 
approving loans and loan guarantees to finance their exports 
as a result the american companies claim they are losing out on 
2 billion to 4 billion a year in foreign contracts 
the bill also authorizes 400 million over the next five years 
for the multinational interamerican development bank to support 
loans in latin america and 150 million for a special imf account 
that subsidizes interest payments on loans owed by very poor 
countries especially in africa 
under the legislation which was approved by the committee on a 
voice vote the us representatives to the world bank and imf 
would be prohibited from approving loans for third world projects 
without an environmental assessment first 
the environmental measure was modified tuesday to allow for some 
exceptions after the treasury department threatened to recommend a 
veto of the bill unless it was given some discretion

the united states should not fear a fortress 
europe when the 12nation european economic community forms a 
single trading market in 1993 a european community official said 
the united states and other european community trade partners 
will benefit considerably when the western european nations unify 
into one 4 trillion market with 320 million consumers said willy 
de clercq a member of the european parliament and chairman of its 
committee for external relations 
us business interests fear that local content regulations 
requiring many goods to be produced in european community nations 
and proposed technical standards for imports could result in 
barriers against us products and turn europe into a trading 
fortress 
these fears are unjustified de clercq said tuesday at a 
washingtonbrussels trade forum far from creating a fortress 
europe the creation of an internal market will create significant 
benefits for our trading partners 
he said the european community 1992 internal markets scheme 
which goes into effect jan 1 1993 will offer considerable 
opportunities to noncommunity interests selling to the european 
community 
those would include he said uniform standards and procedures 
increased investment opportunities and nondiscrimination against 
foreign companies with european community ties 
as for concerns that a selfabsorbed european community will 
become more protectionist de clercq said it would not be in our 
own interests to go down this road 
he noted that the european community relies much more on trade 
than the united states or japan the european community derives 13 
percent of its industrial and commercial goods from imports while 
it has captured 24 percent of the worlds export trade 
by comparison the united states has 8 percent of the world 
export market the japanese 16 percent he said 
tom duesterberg the assistant commerce secretary for 
international economic policy said the united states welcomed the 
european calls but still had major concerns over some provisions of 
european community 1992 
the united states still is worried about standards testing and 
certification procedures for us goods and by local content 
provisions on the auto and broadcasting industries duesterberg 
said 
france is lobbying for tough mandatory quotas on 
foreignproduced tv programs and the us entertainment industry 
fears it could suffer a drastic cutback in its multibilliondollar 
export business to europe 
the european community will adopt a final guidelines on tv 
program content next month and if france prevails that would be 
a very serious problem duesterberg said 
us trade representative carla hills earlier this year said a 
tough european community quota system on television would give the 
bush administration no choice but to consider sanctions under us 
trade laws

los angeles investor alfred checchi has 
agreed to cut klm royal dutch airlines stake in the northwest 
airlines buyout to ease government concerns about foreign airline 
influence over northwest according to a published report today 
the minneapolisbased northwest has agreed to a transportation 
department demand to reduce a 400 million investment by klm and to 
remove klm from the board of nwa inc the airlines parent 
company the wall street journal reported quoting an unidentified 
source 
the star tribune quoting unidentified government sources 
reported wednesday that transportation secretary samuel skinner has 
determined that klms existing 400 million equity stake exceeds 
federal regulations which restrict foreign ownership to 25 percent 
of a us carrier 
according to the wall street journal checchi has agreed to cut 
the klm stake by 225 million to 175 million 
the cutback in the klm investment would reduce the dutch 
airlines percentage of the 700 million in cash equity raised for 
the buyout from 57 percent to 25 percent the journal said klm has 
only a 5 percent voting stake in northwest because its stake is 
mostly in nonvoting preferred stock 
skinner and checchi met friday to discuss skinners review of 
checchis 365 billion takeover of nwa inc neither skinner nor 
checchi has commented publicly on the talks 
northwest spokesman kevin whalen said wednesday the airline 
would have no comment on the published reports until the 
transportation department releases its findings 
in his first public appearance since acquiring northwest this 
summer checchi tuesday night made no reference to the 
transportation department review other than to say sam skinner 
and i are becoming great friends 
in a speech to minnesota businesspeople checchi predicted 
dramatic growth for the airline and outlined his philosophy 
all the assets are in place here for success checchi told 
900 members of the minnesota chamber of commerce at the groups 
annual meeting i look at northwest as absolutely the culminating 
challenge of my career 
checchi who has maintained a low profile since the acquisition 
has spent the past several months meeting northwest employees at 
the company headquarters in eagan a minneapolis suburb he said he 
soon would embark on a worldwide tour of northwest employees in 
an effort to foster employeemanagement relations 
i really do believe that people are our most important 
assets he said i want our employees to have the same sense of 
satisfaction from their work that ive had from mine in the last 15 
years 
checchis group wings holdings ltd bought nwa for 365 
billion or 121 a share he predicted that bank debt for the 
acquisition would be paid off in between five and six years 
northwest is going to grow dramatically in the pacific and 
domestically checchi predicted noting that among the companys 
hidden assets is a 15 billion equity value in its aircraft 
american airline companies checchi said are basically the 
same he said nwa under his reign will surpass the others because 
of its commitment to customer satisfaction 
the airline industry is the industry in which the american 
people have the least confidence of any industry in the us 
providing superior service is the only way to differentiate 
yourself he said 
checchi who holds an mba from harvard business school was 
formerly associated with the marriott hotels and walt disney co

ford motor co shortcircuited a plan earlier 
this month for general motors corp to acquire 30 percent of jaguar 
plc by moving to buy some of the british luxury carmakers stock 
the wall street journal reported today 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources at ford and gm said 
ford announced it was seeking to buy 15 percent of jaguars stock 
shortly after it got wind of the deal top gm executives were 
discussing with jaguar 
executives at gm and the financially troubled jaguar are 
reassessing their positions in light of the ford move the journal 
said 
gm spokesman jack harned said the company had no comment on the 
journal report 
fords announcement on sept 19 that it was buying the jaguar 
stock came in reaction to an anticipated bid by gm for all or part 
of jaguar but ford officials didnt know that the two companies 
were on the verge of announcing the deal in which gm would own 30 
percent of jaguar according to the newspaper 
ford spokesman rex greenslade said the company had heard rumors 
for months that a variety of companies including gm were 
interested in a stake in jaguar but ford did not react solely to a 
gm bid for part of jaguar 
we felt that we wanted to do this to show that we felt this 
was a very good fit between the companies greenslade said talks 
between ford and jaguar had gone on before fords announcement he 
added and none have been scheduled since 
jaguar officials called fords announcement unwelcome 
its obvious that companies the size of jaguar cannot and will 
not survive in the long term greenslade said theyre going to 
have to have strategic associations 
ford has no luxury performance car in its lineup that would 
compete with jaguar gm markets the cadillac allante in the market 
segment ford has confirmed that it is talking with the swedish

former singer co chairman paul a bilzerian was 
sentenced today to four years in prison and fined 15 million for 
federal securities and tax law violations related to three takeover 
attempts and a stock deal 
the sentence for bilzerian 39 a onetime corporate raider who 
made a stunning raid on singer was the largest handed down in the 
governments threeyear crackdown on wall street crime 
us district judge robert l ward also sentenced bilzerian to 
two years probation and 250 hours of community service for his 
conviction on nine felony counts involving deals in 1985 and 1986 
the lure of money has caused him an intelligent young man 
to lose what i perceive to be proper perspective ward said in 
short he lies 
bilzerian was convicted by a federal jury june 9 of securities 
fraud conspiracy to commit tax fraud and filing false disclosure 
statements to the securities and exchange commission 
the charges involved three failed takeover attempts involving 
apparel maker cluett peabody amp co building supplies maker hh 
robertson amp co and hammermill paper co and another transaction 
of armco inc stock 
bilzerian of tampa fla bowed his head and closed his eyes as 
ward read the countbycount verdict his wife terri and other 
family members sat in the front row of the courtroom at us 
district court in manhattan 
ward sentenced bilzerian to four years and fined him 250000 on 
each of six of the counts but ordered the prison terms to run 
concurrently 
bilzerians attorney arthur mathews said he planned to appeal 
assistant us attorney david brodsky cited bilzerians alleged 
arrogance and utter disregard for the law during the court 
proceedings and said a lengthy prison term would serve as a 
deterrent to similar crimes 
he has been convicted of a pattern of fraudulent securities 
transactions brodsky told the judge over an 18month period 
bilzerian committed serious securities crimes over and over again 
mathews sought a suspended sentence on the grounds that the 
conviction was bilzerians first that the violations for which he 
was prosecuted had never before been tried criminally and that 
deterrence had been achieved in the case 
the bilzerian conviction was the first jury verdict in the 
governments whitecollar investigations to date the longest 
sentence was given to admitted felon ivan boesky who is serving a 
threeyear prison term 
the charges were derived from information supplied by boesky 
none of the charges involved bilzerians 106 billion takeover of 
singer in 1988 the case was the first to prosecute illegal stock 
parking in which securities ownership is disguised to dodge 
federal disclosure laws 
bilzerian faced a maximum 45 years in prison and fines of 225 
million 
he resigned as chairman of singer on june 29 when the sec filed 
a suit seeking to recover more than 31 million in illegal profits 
from bilzerian for numerous and serious securities violations

cutting the tax on capital gains both supporters and opponents 
agreed today 
i think we have on my side a slight margin at the present 
time said rep ed jenkins dga chief sponsor of the 
capitalgains cut i think its a very close vote 
rep sander levin dmich who is fighting the reduction told 
reporters after a closed democratic caucus on the issue he still 
does not see enough votes to block the cut but he said i think 
we can catch up 
republicans held their own strategy session where the 
democratic plan of substituting liberalized individual retirement 
accounts for a lower capitalgains tax was portrayed as an excuse 
to raise taxes iras would be financed by a tax increase on 
topincome americans 
its exactly the kind of tax increase democrats proposed 
in 1984 said rep newt gingrich of georgia the republican whip 
i think well find the extra five or six votes necessary to win 
the capitalgains cut is one of numerous divisive issues 
attached to a deficitreduction bill the house is considering 
the 2000page bill would reduce the deficit by 166 billion 
during the budget year that begins oct 1 enough to meet 
requirements of the grammrudman balancedbudget law and avoid 
automatic spending cuts in most federal programs 
because the legislation is so important and considered by some 
to be vetoproof it has become the vehicle to carry numerous 
amendments many having nothing to do with cutting the deficit 
but president bush said tuesday he would continue his fight for 
a lower capital gains tax even if it ties up the bill and triggers 
acrosstheboard cuts 
a president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish 
the ends for which he was elected bush said and i plan to do 
exactly that 
as the sparring on capital gains was taking on more urgency 
votes were expected today on lesser provisions one would block a 
decline in the 8 percent airline ticket tax and other aviation 
taxes and one would repeal a 1986 law requiring employers to prove 
their health insurance plans do not discriminate against lowerpaid 
workers 
the house is to decide thursday between a capital gains tax cut 
and a democratic alternative to expand taxdeductible individual 
retirement accounts 
votes are likely next week on proposals to repeal or modify 
catastrophic medical insurance for retirees and to boost benefits 
for child care for lowincome families 
the democratic leadership hoping to recover from a defeat in 
the house ways and means committee on the capital gains issue is 
instead proposing to expand iras 
bush contends a cut in taxes on capital gains profits from the 
sale of stock and other assets would spur saving and create jobs 
democrats say liberalized iras would serve the same purpose and 
provide more benefit to those with lower incomes 
at the white house on tuesday bush told business leaders he 
will fight for the tax cut even if that delays action on the 
deficit bill and triggers automatic spending reductions 
he said he would not accept the proposed ira liberalization 
which democrats want to finance by raising taxes on the wealthiest 
600000 couples and individuals bush also disputed democratic 
arguments that a capital gains cut is a windfall for the rich 
i think we ought to stand up to the understandable political 
rhetoric on the other side rhetoric that we heard all last year 
and that were now hearing once again he said 
rep barbara boxer dcalif a former stockbroker called the 
capital gains plan a quick fix for a quick profit for those who 
earn over 200000 a year 
as the house began what is expected to be a week and a half of 
debate on the spending bill few members bragged about the massive 
package 
some complained that many of the deficit reductions are phony 
simply shifting costs from one budget year to another others 
criticized the use of amendments that do nothing to cut the deficit 
some measures would outlaw obscene dialaporn phone 
services renew tax benefits for a variety of special interests 
raise the amount that social security recipients may earn without 
losing part of their pensions boost assistance for the poor and 
write into the law the fairness doctrine which would require 
broadcasters to air all sides of issues 
this is the melting pot act said rep steven schiff rnm 
it seems that every issue we have been debating in the 101st 
congress is a part of this bill 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the ways and means 
committee said that in packing the bill lawmakers signaled our 
willingness to bow to any specialinterest group that is aggressive 
and singleminded enough to hound us into submission

opec ministers today struck a deal to boost their 
production ceiling a modest amount in the final months of the year 
but two cartel members indicated they would not go along 
nigerian oil minister rilwanu lukman president of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries said the countries 
would lift their supply cap by a million barrels a day to 205 
million barrels 
algeria declared the move illegal and kuwait who has been 
openly exceeding its production limit said it had made no 
commitments 
the head of the algerian delegation who demanded anonymity 
said it is something that algeria doesnt associate itself 
with 
it is a decision that is illegal he said immediately after 
the ministers final round of talks at a luxury geneva hotel 
as far as we can see it has kind of poor thinking behind 
it he said 
kuwaiti oil minister sheik ali khalifa alsabah said his country 
would continue not to recognize any restrictions on its output he 
said kuwait had made no commitments either legal or moral to hold 
down production 
the disarray came in the fifth day of talks held to try to come 
up with an acceptable production strategy in the final quarter of 
the year 
the ministers were at odds throughout the meeting over how much 
they could raise any production ceiling without sending prices 
sliding 
algerian oil minister sadek boussena who left the meeting 
monday to return to algiers for a legislative meeting had pressed 
for retaining the current ceiling of 195 million barrels a day 
he had said the cartel should concentrate on bringing prices up 
about a dollar to the cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
others argued the market was strong enough to absorb the 
additional supply 
the ministers failed to come up with a formula for meeting some 
countries demands for a higher share of opecs production 
we solved a good deal iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi 
said before the meeting maybe well leave something for 
november 
the ministers were scheduled to meet in late november to plan 
their production strategy for 1990 
the officials had spent the day studying a surprise iranian 
proposal to see if it could form the basis of a compromise but 
they deferred taking any action on the plan 
in its plan iran proposed the production ceiling be pegged 
above 205 million barrels a day to take care of demands by kuwait 
the united arab emirates gabon ecuador and qatar it could go as 
high as 215 million barrels to cover them 
its a good proposal said a senior kuwaiti delegate who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
as sketched by iranian delegates their formula would give all 
13 countries larger individual quotas meaning they could produce 
more crude in the last quarter than now but kuwait the united 
arab emirates gabon ecuador and qatar would be given bigger 
percentage shares 
each country is assigned an individual quota based on its 
percentage share of the total for example saudi arabia the 
cartels no 1 producer has nearly a 25 percent share of the total 
supply 
before the latest proposal the members were considering a saudi 
plan to push production up to 205 million barrels a day according 
to a delegate all countries would share proportionately in the 
increase 
opec ministers have been meeting since saturday to find a way to 
raise their output ceiling in the last quarter without sending 
prices tumbling the talks had been on the verge of collapse monday 
evening 
crude prices have held fairly steady in recent months despite 
reports that some members have been overproducing 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate the key american brand closed up 7 cents 
on tuesday at 1953 a 42gallon barrel well above the cartels 
benchmark 18 a barrel 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

a group of seven cement manufacturers have 
complained to federal officials that mexican competitors unfairly 
are selling cement in the united states at cutrate prices 
the manufacturers committee made up of producers in texas 
arizona new mexico and florida said it filed petitions tuesday 
with the us international trade commission and the us commerce 
dept asking for duties on imports of gray portland cement large 
enough to eliminate any price differential 
dumping cement in us markets cannot be allowed to 
continue said clarence c comer chief executive of 
houstonbased southdown inc and head of the manufacturers group 
which claims the us price for the imported cement is about 
onehalf what mexicans are charged 
if we lose out to fair competition from mexico so be it 
comer said our investigation to date however convinces us that 
the mexicans success in us markets is due to dumping and not to 
any other factor 
since 1983 the group said seven cement plants have closed in 
arizona new mexico and texas with two more closing in florida 
last year mexican imports accounted for 14 percent of the market 
in the three border states and 22 percent of the florida market 
the group said 
mexican producers continue to build exportoriented capacity 
aimed at american markets comer said we dont want to see 
imports stopped or to deter fair competition but when dumping of 
cement hurts us companies and workers the time has come to 
enforce united states laws against unfair import practices 
besides southdown the manufacturers are box crow cement co 
midlothian texas florida crushed stone co brooksville fla 
giffordhill and co dallas ideal basic industries denver 
phoenix cement co phoenix and texas industries inc dallas

five months after spurning a takeover bid from 
ncnb corp citizens and southern corp has agreed to a 47 
billion merger with virginiabased sovran financial corp to create 
the nations 14thlargest banking company 
atlantabased camps and sovran announced the deal tuesday saying 
the merger has been discussed over the past two years the combined 
banks which will maintain separate headquarters under a new 
holding company will have assets of 47 billion and 976 offices in 
seven states plus washington dc 
the new company will be calle avantor financial corp 
we are creating a large nationally competitive franchise with 
a powerful presence in major highgrowth markets and were 
underwriting it with superior credit quality the two banks said 
in a joint announcement 
we feel its a perfect fit said camps spokesman scott 
scredon we dont overlap our management cultures are very 
similar and we each double our market presence we both feel it 
couldnt be any better 
in terms of assets the merger would create the nations 
14thlargest bank holding company 
the friendly nature of the merger was in stark contrast to the 
mood in april when charlotte ncbased ncnb targeted camps in a 
24 billion takeover bid that would have created the nations 
sixthlargest bank 
bennett a brown camps chairman and designated head of the 
combined company told securities analysts in new york today that 
the campssovran merger wasnt in reaction to ncnbs unwanted offer 
we started conversations two years ago he said 
ncnb also issued a statement today dismissing speculation that 
it might want to reenter the picture since its previous offer 
would now be worth about 54 a share substantially higher than the 
approximately 34 of stock that camps shareholders would receive 
under the merger with sovran 
during a tense monthlong courtship by ncnb camps officials 
refused even to discuss the deal ncnb eventually withdrew the 
offer saying it did not want to get involved in a long fight 
brown said camps board of directors saw greater longterm value 
in the deal with sovran than in the short profit shareholders 
would have received from ncnb 
this is an extremely friendly deal said lacy shockley a 
banking industry analyst with smith barney harris uphan amp co in 
new york ncnb was unusually hostile here you have two very 
similar banks this is the truest merger of equals ive ever seen 
ginny mackin an ncnb spokeswoman tuesday declined to comment 
on the campssovran merger we dont comment on what other banks 
do she said 
scredon said the boards of the two institutions approved a 
definitive agreement tuesday he said final approval from 
shareholders and regulatory agencies is expected during the first 
quarter of 1990 
under the merger agreement each of sovrans 598 million shares 
of outstanding common stock will convert into 123 shares of the 
new companys common stock 
each of camps 62 million shares of outstanding common stock will 
convert into one share of the new companys common stock worth 
about 3487 
camps chairman bennett a brown will become chairman and chief 
executive officer of the new company while retaining his position 
at camps sovran chairman albert b gornto will become chairman of the 
new companys executive committee and will retain his position at 
the norfolk vabased bank 
dennis c bottorff president and chief operating officer of 
sovran will be president and chief operating officer of avantor 
and become chief executive officer of the new company upon browns 
retirement at that time hugh chapman now president of camps would 
become chairman of avantor 
camps has 489 bank offices in georgia florida and south carolina 
sovran has 487 offices in virginia maryland tennessee kentucky 
and washington dc 
its a big deal said ms shockley its going to create 
the powerhouse in the southeast 
she said the merger is likely to spur more such activity in the 
region it puts pressure on other southeastern banks to do 
something she said 
katherine hart an analyst at interstate johnson lane in 
atlanta said however that while the merger greatly increases the 
banks presence it is premature to predict what effect it will 
have on earnings 
size itself does not make you automatically better than 
everyone else ms hart said

the leader of the striking eastern airlines pilots 
wednesday said they are appalled at transportation secretary 
samuel skinners opposition to government intervention into the 
strike 
skinner disclosed tueday he has written to senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine and called a proposed 
congressionally mandated committee entirely inappropriate such 
a move can only hinder the work of the bankruptcy court 
skinner wrote 
the senate may consider a version of a house of representatives 
bill passed in march that would force president bush to establish 
an emergency board or blueribbon commission to investigate and 
make recommendations on the dispute between eastern and its three 
major labor unions 
we urge the members of the senate who have followed the 
course of this struggle for almost seventh months and who 
understand both the issues and will of the voters to look beyond 
the limited vision of the secretarys letter said skip copeland 
recently elected to head the pilots local 
copeland said 1988 department of transportation and federal 
aviation adminstration probes of eastern operations were fatally 
flawed whitewashes copeland said the pilots union had withheld 
criticism of the faa probe which copeland said found safety 
deficiencies that could have warranted shutting down eastern 
because it was hoped promised safety improvements and cooperation 
would save the airline 
a new investigation would examine past practices current 
eastern operations he said are on a very thin margin of 
safety 
theyre trotting out the old red herring of safety company 
spokesman robin matell said its an obvious act of desperation 
by the pilots union in response to easterns ability to rebuild 
successfully despite alpas efforts to shut the airline down 
easterns three unions went on strike march 4 and eastern filed 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days later eastern 
is trying to rebuild without the unions and says it will emerge 
from bankruptcy at about twothirds its prestrike size 
copeland said easterns rebuilding plan is a controlled 
liquidation that signals the demise of a onceproud company and 
he said despite skinners comments he didnt think president bush 
could in good conscious veto the bill if passed by the senate 
skinner said that while the bush administration regrets that the 
strike wasnt resolved by mediation it believes government should 
not take over in managementlabor disputes he also noted that 
eastern is in the jurisdiction of federal bankruptcy court 
skinner told mitchell the court is the proper place to handle 
the dispute unless it threatens safety in which case the dot would 
get involved he argued that congress has no appropriate role 
and said he would urge bush to veto the bill if it is passed

a savings and loan and two former officers 
have been indicted on charges of conspiracy theft and fraud in 
connection with the studentloan program federal prosecutors said 
wednesday 
florida federal savings bank through its studentloan division 
submitted fraudulent insurance claims for 17000 students totaling 
35 million said gregory w kehoe assistant us attorney for 
floridas middle district 
he said the claims were supported by documents falsely showing 
that attempts were made to collect 
florida federal received some 18 million from the department of 
education before the agency shut the door keohoe said 
named as defendants with the st petersburgbased thrift were 
robert o harmas 42 of noblesville ind and james j lamantia 
59 of largo 
the doctored claims were submitted between novemmber 1986 and 
july 1987 the 43count indictment states 
at the time florida federal formerly florida federal savings 
and loan association was the second largest thrift in the 
southeast and the third largest provider of guaranteed student 
loans in the country authorities said 
harmas was a vice president and operations manager of the loan 
division lamantia was assistant vice president and manager of 
collection and claims 
the loan program makes lowinterest loans available to students 
to pay for postsecondary education lenders lend their own funds 
and the federal government or a guarantee agency insures against 
loss due to default by a borrower 
the students never had an opportunity to repay the loans 
kehoe said theres no evidence the claims or proper documents 
were ever sent to them 
kehoe said evidence indicated the money went to the bank 
each count carries a maximum penalty on conviction of five years 
in prison and 50000 the prosecutor said the defendants were 
expected to surrender

a dallas company tried to win a 400 million 
contract to build mailsorting equipment by buying a member of 
the us postal services board of governors a federal prosecutor 
charged today 
in opening statements at the fraud and conspiracy trial of 
recognition equipment inc and two of its top officers assistant 
us attorney joseph valder said the firms chief executive 
officer william moore became obsessed with getting a major 
postal contract 
in an attempt to achieve his goal said the prosecutor moore 
and his codefendant rei vice president for marketing robert 
reedy sought help from peter voss a member of the postal 
services board of governors 
at voss urging rei hired a small consulting firm headed by 
detroitarea businessman john gnau valder said rei arranged to 
pay 325000 to gnaus firm in little more than a year the 
prosecutor said with a portion of the proceeds being funneled to 
voss 
this case is not about aggressivebutlegal business 
practices said valder its about the fact that moore and 
reedy cheated they lied they stole they covered up 
the case is about moore and reedy blocking government 
functions by deceit valder said 
moore and reedy were involved in a scheme to defraud the 
government by buying a governor he said 
voss who headed ronald reagans 1980 ohio presidential 
campaign received a fouryear sentence in 1986 after pleading 
guilty to taking an illegal gratuity and to expense account fraud 
gnau who headed reagans 1980 michigan campaign was sentenced 
to three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal 2500 gratuity 
to voss 
the case is being heard by us district court judge george 
revercomb because attorneys for rei moore and reedy waived their 
clients constitutional right to a jury trial 
jenny haynes barker rei vice president said the case is so 
complicated that it would best be handled by a judge 
if convicted moore and reedy would each face a maximum of 33 
years imprisonment and 15 million in fines both men are on paid 
leaves of absence they have maintained their innocence and say 
they plan to return to their former jobs if exonerated 
a sevencount indictment in october 1988 followed an 
investigation by the us postal inspection service and a federal 
grand jury into details of competition for a computer automation

flagship chain prefers a mixture of top 40 jazz contemporary 
tunes and light rock n roll to make the buttoneddown blazered 
set feel at home 
retailers changing their merchandise mix might need a face lift 
for their musical profiles when safari wear seemed to be going out 
of style gap incs banana republic chain switched from fantasy 
islandtype melodies and bird calls to contemporary jazz says 
malone 
marketing experts say music is an important element of the 
atmosphere within stores and elsewhere tailoring an 
establishments ambience to a specific target market can work 
wonders for business 
its very clear that music affects behavior especially in 
terms of shopping behavior says ronald e milliman a marketing 
professor at western kentucky university 
research on the subject is limited milliman says but it is 
believed that music can improve store image make employees 
happier reduce stress and stimulate purchases 
a poll by the gallup organization inc done for aei said 91 
percent of store patrons surveyed thought music had an effect on 
their actions the respondents said music could induce good moods 
and boost energy levels aei contends that customers who feel 
comfortable in stores might spend more time there and wind up 
spending more money 
aei which claims to have pioneered the idea of programming 
original artist music is regarded as the leader in the field the 
privatelyheld seattle company supplies sound for most major 
restaurant chains and scores of retailers hotels banks and other 
places where music is heard it also handles inflight music for 
numerous airlines 
besides offering advice on which music would suit a specific 
audience aei helps with selection and installation of sound 
systems 
but most important it provides a constantly updated collection 
of tapes that fits into various categories ranging from smooth 
savoir faire featuring swing blues and sultry numbers to hot 
amp hip a mixture of current pop favorites light funk dance 
reggae and foreign hits 
to preserve the mood during special seasons like christmas a 
dash of traditional fare can be blended into the mix 
people would get suicidal if you blasted white christmas at 
them all day says malone 
the music on aeis tapes are original recordings not special 
arrangements made just for the tapes aei negotiates with artists 
to use their work and works closely with the distribution arms of 
record companies 
a casual listener might think theyre hearing a commercialfree 
radio station instead of an aei tape playing radio stations in 
stores is a marketing nono because competitors ads might be heard 
music can have a great impact on a comfort zone says 
malone referring to how an atmosphere affects a listener 
obviously not everyone has the same taste in music 
so next time youre blasted out of a trendy boutique by 
earpiercing rock with a chestpummeling beat consider this maybe 
youre not the type of customer that the retailer expects to shop 
there

sugar cane harvesters have filed a 
lawsuit claiming they have been underpaid by more than 30 million 
during the past six seasons by south florida growers 
the lawsuit filed monday as an amended classaction to include 
more than 10000 workers who have worked for six companies since 
1982 alleges that sugar cane harvesters were not given proper 
credit for the amount of cane cut 
the original lawsuit was filed in palm beach county circuit 
court in august on behalf of four jamaican farmworkers in a 
separate action monday the growers filed a motion to dismiss the 
original lawsuit 
defendants named in the suit are the sugar cane growers 
cooperative atlantic sugar association united states sugar corp 
okeelanta corp osceola farms and cane contractors 
under the federal governments guestworker program growers can 
hire foreign cane cutters if the companies can show there are not 
enough us citizens willing to work for the minimum task rate of 
530 for each ton cut growers then submit to several state 
employment centers clearance orders that explain the work the 
rate of pay and how much work is expected each day 
the clearance orders cited in the suit stated that workers were 
to average one ton per hour for eight hours a day according to jim 
green a lawyer for the canecutters 
for that work according to the clearance orders harvesters 
were to be paid at a rate of 530 a ton the attorney said the 
lawsuit claims the workers received 350 per ton and 425 per ton 
but charles caulkins an attorney for the growers said the six 
companies contend the clearance order calls for payment per hour 
not per ton

hasbro inc said it will no longer use 
white rats rabbits and other animals to test childrens cosmetics 
for safety 
the decision follows similar announcements by adult cosmetic 
manufacturers animalrights activists have staged two 
demonstrations at hasbros plant here in the past two years and 
urged consumers to boycott hasbro cosmetics 
we certainly applaud hasbros decision said steven ruggeri 
new england director of friends of animals i think its the most 
enlightened approach 
hasbro spokesman wayne charness said tuesday the company has 
used animals to test 15 products in the past six years he did not 
identify the products but said the tests verified they were safe 
if swallowed and did not irritate eyes or skin 
weve always been sensitive to both sides of the issue and 
always made a policy of avoiding tests on animals whenever 
possible he said because there was such a limited amount of 
products requiring animal testing we decided to eliminate it 
charness declined to say whether the protests influenced 
hasbros decision 
animalrights activists have said tests to determine whether the 
products are safe for eyes caused the rabbits unnecessary pain 
because their eyes do not produce tears to wash the substances away 
avon products inc and revlon inc two of the biggest 
manufacturers of adult cosmetics recently announced they would 
replace animal tests of new toiletries with computer models 
existing safety records and human volunteers

final approval of former ohio financier 
marvin warners 16 million bankruptcy settlement plan was delayed 
wednesday because of questions over court costs a family trust and 
interest on back taxes 
us bankruptcy judge george proctor set a nov 19 deadline to 
solve the problems 
the judge said he wants to either confirm a plan to settle 
warners personal bankruptcy case dismiss it convert it again to 
a chapter 7 liquidation or handle it some other way under chapter 
11 reorganization 
the biggest problem is a dispute with the internal revenue 
service over back taxes and interest owed by warner 
warners tax attorney bart brown testified that discussions 
with the irs showed that warner owes 25 million in taxes plus 
37 million in interest for a total of 62 million the irs has 
filed a claim against warners estate for 13 million 
under the proposed plan warner said he will pay the irs back in 
yearly installments over six years at dispute is the amount of 
interest warner will have to pay during the period 
also at issue is dissolving a warner family trust containing 
some of the money needed for settlement attorneys said they need a 
circuit court judge in ocala to approve dissolving the trust which 
they said could happen in under a month 
warner also must pay legal fees ordered by the court or reach an 
agreement with attorneys before the next hearing 
warners creditors have approved the settlement and it has 
cleared critical court hearings in ohio and fort lauderdale 
under the proposal warner immediately would pay 10 million and 
make three annual payments of 2 million beginning with the first 
anniversary of the plans approval 
ohio officials said the state will accept 8 million because 
warner cant afford the 22 million a court ordered him to pay as 
restitution for bailing out his failed thift home state savings 
bank of cincinnati creditors will divide the other 8 million 
at a hearing monday in fort lauderdale thomas tew the 
courtappointed trustee representing investors of defunct esm 
government securities inc backed the plan 
fort lauderdalebased esm was closed by federal regulators in 
march 1985 home state which lost about 144 million in esm 
investments collapsed four days later and triggered a crisis among 
ohio thrifts 
tew said the esmrelated creditors will receive about 128 
million under the settlement leaving warner about 5 million and 
his 153acre ocala horse farm 
warner 70 who was flooded with 45 billion in lawsuits 
following home states collapse filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection in october 1987

to 252 billion after a 2 percent rise to 2566 billion in july 
contracts for public works projects fell 10 percent to an annual 
rate of 424 billion the lowest value in six months reflecting 
budgetary restraint on the funding for construction of highways 
bridges and other infrastructure work the survey said

relatively unchanged from july at 1186 billion a decline in 
multifamily construction was offset by a gain in hotel contracts 
onefamily home contracts remained steady 
starts of onefamily units havent changed significantly since 
april despite the decline in mortgage rates since that time 
said george a christie economist for fw dodge 
nonresidential building slipped 2 percent in august to an 
annual rate of 91 billion 
for the first eight months of the year the unadjusted figure 
for all newly started construction totaled 1758 billion down 1 
percent from the same period in 1988

in building contracts over the first eight months of last year the 
northeastern and western sections of the country were unchanged 
from last year and the south was down 4 percent

with several bigname department stores seeking new owners the 
us retail industry may be looking at a 4 billion clearance sale 
in an industry already reeling from the effects of financial 
difficulties facing one major store operator some of the nations 
most famous department store chains are on the block in sales that 
analysts estimate could reap more than 4 billion 
two respected chains catering to affluent customers saks and 
marshall fields became the latest to go on sale as their parent 
company bat industries plc launched a major realignment of 
operations 
by undoing some of its diversity the british conglomerate hopes 
to thwart a 22 billion takeover charge led by financier sir james 
goldsmith 
bat will sell its american retail holdings but keep its 
lucrative tobacco and financial services businesses in a plan to 
boost its worth to shareholders and keep them loyal to current 
management 
arthur martinez senior vice president in charge of retail 
operations at batus inc bats american arm expressed optimism 
about the intention to sell the retailing businesses which was 
announced tuesday 
we have working for us the lack of a distress sale environment 
and some splendid properties he said in an interview im very 
confident of our ability to get a satisfactory price 
the batowned retailers joined trendsetting bloomingdales on 
the auction block bloomingdales has been on the market for 
several weeks due to the problems of its debtencumbered owner 
campeau corp 
the canadian holding company might be forced to part with other 
pieces of its vast retail collection depending on orders from its 
financial rescuer olympia amp york developments ltd 
if high fashion isnt to everyones tastes may department 
stores co wants to sell its caldor and venture discount chains 
and if this isnt a big enough selection us stores belonging 
to australias troubled hooker corp including the b altman amp co 
and bonwit teller chains may be in the market for new owners 
hookers us subsididary lj hooker corp is restructuring 
after filing for bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
theres an awful lot of retail property on the block right 
now it may make some available at very attractive terms and i 
dont mean junk debt said analyst janet mangano of josephthal amp 
co inc 
bidders with the wherewithal to make a mostly cash offer could 
be in the drivers seat if theyre steering toward a retail 
acquisition said mangano 
but the glut means a desperate seller like campeau probably 
cant count on getting as much money as desired 
gilbert harrison chairman of financo inc a merger advisory 
firm specializing in retail industry transactions said saks and 
bloomingdales are worldclass businesses that will lure many 
potential buyers from the united states and abroad 
two possible bidders have revealed their intentions toward 
bloomingdales the chains chairman marvin s traub and crown 
american corp a big us shopping mall developer 
as many as 10 other individuals or groups reportedly are 
considering whether to pursue the new yorkbased 17store chain 
nonretail groups might be reluctant to bid for the stores in 
light of the predicaments of campeau and hooker which both were 
more surefooted in real estate when they ventured into us 
retailing 
for one thing nonretailers are unaccustomed to the amount of 
credit management thats involved in buying merchandise that might 
sell out quickly or linger on shelves if fickle consumers change 
their buying habits 
i am distressed to see how many retail properties are for sale 
at the same time said morgan stanley amp co analyst walter loeb 
he said heavy debt loads have put unbearable pressure on retailers 
and led many of them into trouble 
on top of the 1 billion or so analysts expect bloomingdales 
might sell for theres the roughly 15 billion that caldor and 
venture should fetch 
st louisbased may which itself is mentioned as a possible 
pursuer of saks or bloomingdales has about 120 caldor stores and 
about 73 venture outlets may owns the lord amp taylor chain 
bats retail businesses would go for at least 2 billion 
analysts said new yorkbased saks has 46 stores from coast to 
coast and chicagobased marshall fields operates about two dozen 
stores in illinois ohio texas and wisconsin 
fields chairman philip b miller is considering a 
managementled buyout of the chain but he has not disclosed what 
price might be offered 
among bats other us retail businesses are iveys a 
charlotte ncbased chain of 20plus stores and breuners of san 
ramon calif which has nearly four dozen furniture stores and 
rental outlets

columbia pictures entertainment incs 
34 billion purchase by japans sony corp adds another chapter to 
the upanddown history of a scrappy little studio that rose from 
poverty row to become a major force in hollywood 
for sony the deal announced wednesday means another big 
foothold in the us entertainment industry for the giant 
electronics manufacturer 
sony which bought cbs records for 2 billion last year has 
been seeking properties that will provide the records and movies it 
hopes consumers will use with its stereos and videocassette 
recorders 
columbias attractiveness stems from its successful stable of 
television productions as well as the storied studio responsible 
for such movies as it happened one night on the waterfront 
and ghostbusters 
columbias rise was led by bombastic founder harry cohn dubbed 
white fang by writer ben hecht commenting on cohns 
wellattended funeral in 1958 red skelton cracked on his 
television show it only proves that if you give the people what 
they want theyll turn out for it 
columbia began in 1920 as the cbc film sales co using the 
initials of its founders brothers harry and jack cohn and harry 
brandt the quality of their initial films prompted the movie trade 
to call the company corned beef and cabbage the founders changed 
the name to columbia pictures in 1924 
harry cohn operated a tiny studio on hollywoods poverty row 
alongside other shoestring producers columbias growth accelerated 
with the advent of frank capra in 1928 during which he directed 
seven films capras movies of the 1930s including it happened 
one night lost horizon mr deeds goes to town and you 
cant take it with you helped establish columbia as a major 
studio 
cohn and columbia produced some of the most popular and 
sophisticated films of the thirties and forties one night of 
love the awful truth here comes mr jordan gilda 
the jolson story cover girl all the kings men among 
the columbia stars were rita hayworth glenn ford william holden 
kim novak broderick crawford and judy holliday 
in 1952 cohn broke hollywoods opposition to television and 
formed a subsidiary screen gems to produce tv series the film 
division continued to thrive with such hits as born yesterday 
from here to eternity on the waterfront the caine 
mutiny and the bridge on the river kwai 
columbias television arm remains hugely profitable making 155 
million on revenue of 620 million in the companys last fiscal 
year ended feb 28 
the death of harry cohn in 1958 coincided with the end of the 
bigstudio era columbia became host to a number of independent 
producers such as sam spiegel lawrence of arabia ray stark 
funny girl the way we were carl foreman the guns of 
navarone otto preminger anatomy of a murder stanley 
kramer guess whos coming to dinner and mike frankovich 
cactus flower 
once located in the heart of hollywood columbia sold its famous 
sunset and gower studios in the late 1960s and moved production 
facilities to the burbank studios which it shares with warner bros 
columbias unsteady course continued during the 1970s and in 
1982 it was acquired by cocacola co the marriage between the 
softdrink empire and the entertainment company worked for a time 
thanks largely to ghostbusters and the karate kid 
columbias share of the 1984 boxoffice receipts was 21 percent 
another cocacola subsidiary tristar pictures claimed 53 
percent of domestic theater admissions warner bros had 23 percent 
and paramount 226 percent that year 
but despite cocacolas attempts to inject its production and 
marketing techniques into the movie business its film divisions 
declined tristar could not produce a solid hit and columbia 
sponsored the disastrous ishtar 
columbias stability also was undermined by unsteady management 
the studio had a parade of bosses including david begelman who 
was deposed in an embezzlement scandal francis fay vincent who 
now is commissioner of major league baseball frank price and david 
puttnam producer of chariots of fire and the killing 
fields 
after taking over columbia in late 1986 puttnam said he 
wouldnt follow the hollywood establishment trend toward bigger 
budgets and higher salaries for stars the stand quickly alienated 
powerful producers directors actors and talent agents including 
actor bill murray director norman jewison producers ray stark and 
martin ransohoff and the creative artists agency 
after less than a year puttnam he was replaced by movie 
producer dawn steel 
in 1987 cocacola combined columbia and tristar into a new 
company columbia pictures entertainment and retained a 49 percent 
interest while distributing part of its interest to cocacola 
shareholders 
during cocacolas ownership columbias loews theatre 
management corp took off loews acquired in 1986 is among the

citizens amp southern corp of atlanta said 
wednesday its merger with virginiabased sovran financial corp 
creating the nations 14thlargest banking company was not a 
reaction to an earlier hostile bid by ncnb corp 
this is not a reactionary thing we started conversations 
with sovran two years ago bennett a brown camps chairman and 
designated chief executive officer of the new combined company 
told a meeting of securities analysts in new york 
he said those negotiations werent revealed at the time of 
ncnbs stockswap offer last april because the bid valued at 
around 44 a share or 24 billion was too pricey 
citizens had claimed the value of ncnbs stock was inflated 
after its takeover of the banks of the first republicbank corp of 
dallas last year 
sovran didnt have the capacity to be a white knight 
brown said we were never considering an acquisition of each 
other only a merger of equals 
the campssovran agreement announced tuesday would give sovran 
control of 53 percent of the combined bank holding company to be 
known as avantor financial corp and camps a 47 percent stake 
under the deal sovran shareholders would receive 123 shares of 
avantor for each of their 598 milliion common shares outstanding 
citizen shareholders would get one share for each of their 62 
million outstanding shares the agreement is conditioned upon 
approval from shareholders and bank regulators 
wall street gave the deal a lukewarm reception wednesday in 
composite trading on the new york stock exchange camps closed down 
25 cents to 3462 while sovran fell 75 cents to 4137 
the merger creates the nations 14thlargest bank holding 
company with 47 billion in assets 34 billion in deposits and 976 
branches in eight states in the southeast 
besides creating a regional powerhouse the deal also represents 
the secondlargest bank merger in the united states behind the 
combination of bank of new york co and the irving bank corp 
earlier this year 
brown said camps board of directors saw greater longterm value 
in the deal with sovran than in the short profit shareholders 
would have received from ncnb 
the mutual attractions are largely due to the cultural 
similarities brown said 
he noted the combined banking company will have double market 
power but little overlapping operations in maryland virginia 
kentucky tennessee south carolina georgia florida and 
wshington dc 
brown said avantor had more growth potential on the consumer 
level than most larger moneycenter banks because it wasnt bogged 
down by problem loans to less developed countries only 50 million 
of avantors 31 billion total loan portfolio includes third world 
debt he said 
i believe were well armed to address the future challenges of 
the 1990s added hugh m chapman camps president and chief 
operating officer 
sovran chairman albert b gornto will serve as chairman of the 
executive committee of avantor 
during wednesdays meeting at least one analyst speculated ncnb 
might want to reenter the picture since its previous offer would 
now be worth about 54 a share much higher than the approximately 
34 of stock camps shareholders will get under the sovran merger 
but charlotte ncbased ncnb which withdrew the previous 
offer after camps refused to even discuss the deal dismissed such 
speculation 
in a brief statement wednesday it said it would continue its 
strategy of acquiring thrifts in texas and the southeast

opec ministers wednesday adjourned five days of 
sometimes heated talks by raising their production cap only a 
modest amount to try to strengthen crude prices in the coming 
months 
but the final accord still grossly understated the actual amount 
of oil the cartel is believed to be producing and at least three 
members said they would refuse to recognize the deal 
kuwait and the united arab emirates already producing beyond 
their assigned limits said they had no plans to restrain their 
pumping algeria declared the deal illegal 
opec president rilwanu lukman said the group would raise its 
output ceiling by a million barrels a day to 205 million barrels 
from 195 million for the final three months of the year various 
estimates put opecs actual production at closer to 225 million 
barrels a day 
the meeting of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries ended in confusion after the ministers failed to resolve 
their deep divisions several countries reportedly had asked for a 
bigger share of the pie 
crude oil prices fluctuated during the talks as investors 
awaited a decision 
some analysts predicted the cartels decision would translate 
into even higher production and dampen prices 
fergus macleod analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london 
said it means oil prices could weaken a bit from now on 
on the consumer side it may portend slightly lower prices 
said michael rothman analyst at merrill lynch capital markets in 
new york 
west texas intermediate the us benchmark crude was off about 
a dime at midday but closed 6 cents higher at 1959 a barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
a basket of crudes monitored by opec had been trading about a 
dollar off the cartels target of 18 a 42gallon barrel 
lukman said the extra production would be divided 
proportionately among all 13 members each countrys quota or 
supply target would be raised by a certain amount 
lukman said the arrangement should mean slightly lower 
production well see a lot better prices he predicted 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said he felt 
positive about the agreement 
the others are worried prices will go down he said i 
think at the minimum they will stay level 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been ignoring their 
quotas to press their demands for bigger shares 
ali khalifa alsabah the kuwaiti oil minister said he made no 
commitments either legal or moral to anybody to hold down 
production 
the united arab emirates mana saeed otaiba said he did not 
intend to go along with the deal according to ginandjar 
sabah predicted demand would rise to 23 million barrels a day in 
the octoberdecember quarter 
hopefully he said that will keep prices at very near 
opecs reference price 
others however have estimated demand for opec oil at 22 
million barrels 
the decision to increase the ceiling was made after the 
ministers struggled for a day with a surprise iranian plan to solve 
the output demands of kuwait and the united arab emirates 
after failing to do so they settled on the stopgap measure 
immediately after the decision was announced the head of the 
algerian delegation who demanded anonymity said it is 
something that algeria doesnt associate itself with 
it is a decision that is illegal he said adding it was 
based on poor thinking 
the algerian minister sadek boussena returned to algiers on 
monday to attend a legislative meeting before his departure he 
had urged the participants to concentrate on getting prices up to 
the cartels 18 target 
the ministers were at odds throughout the meeting over how much 
they could raise any production ceiling without sending prices 
sliding 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said that if prices tumbled much 
the ministers would gather again opec has already planned a 
meeting for november to plan production strategy for 1990 
the ministers said they intended to take up the iranian plan 
again at that meeting 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said his proposal would 
raise the supply ceiling to 215 million barrels a day this he 
said would satisfy the demands of kuwait the united arab 
emirates gabon and ecuador for bigger slices of the production pie 
saudi arabia iran iraq and qatar would retain their current 
shares all others would lose some 
this would be the basis to solve the problems of opec 
hopefully for good aqazadeh said 
he said libya and the united arab emirates could not immediately 
go along with the plan libya has demanded the same share as kuwait 
each country is assigned an individual quota based on a formula 
of percentages for example saudi arabia the cartels no 1 
producer has nearly a 25 percent share of the total supply 
several opec members such as kuwait and the uae believe they 
are entitled to larger quotas based on production capacity 
opec members include algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

international business machines corps stock 
sank wednesday putting a drag on the broader market after the 
company said it expected earnings for the quarter to be below 
analysts forecasts 
the stock dropped at the opening bell and ended up down 6 a 
share to 11150 on heavy volume of more than 5 million shares 
ibm is the most valuable company in the united states as 
measured by its market value and is a component of the dow jones 
industrial average of 30 stocks the average managed a gain of 912 
points to 267306 but it would have risen more without ibms drop 
besides its quarterly troubles ibm said that if the effects of 
the stronger dollar and the shift to leasing by ibm customers 
continues for the rest of 1989 it will also be difficult for ibm 
to achieve fullyear results within the current range of 
estimates 
the rise of the dollar hurts reported earnings of multinationals 
such as ibm by cutting the dollar value of profits that are made in 
foreign currencies the shift to leasing from buying cuts into 
shortterm revenue by spreading out payments received from placing 
new products with customers 
in addition ibm said profits were being hurt in the 
julyseptember quarter by the transition to a new range of 
products which increases costs and temporarily depresses revenue 
by interrupting sales of the older lines 
ibm chairman john f akers said demand for ibm products and 
services continues to be good worldwide he said the company 
expects growth in all major geographic areas for the year with the 
rate of growth continuing to be stronger outside the united states 
ibm had been expected to earn about 222 a share in the current 
quarter according to a survey of 23 security analysts by the 
institutional brokers estimate system of lynch jones amp ryan the 
range of estimates was 214 to 228 
frank metz ibms chief financial officer told an analyst that 
net earnings in the current quarter would be measurably below the 
195 a share in operating earnings the company had a year ago 
spokesman peter thonis confirmed 
for the full year the average estimate of 42 analysts had been 
1036 a share and the range was 10 to 1080 the estimate

crude oil futures seesawed in hectic trading 
wednesday before closing higher after opec announced it had agreed 
to raise its official production limit by 1 million barrels a day 
observers said that while the agreement legitimizes part of what 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries is already 
producing it still undershoots the cartels actual production 
believed to be above 225 million barrels a day 
the new accord raises the official ceiling to 205 million 
barrels a day in the fourth quarter from 195 million in the third 
period 
theyre getting closer to institutionalizing what theyre 
already doing said peter beutel assistant director of the 
energy group at elders futures inc so it didnt solve any 
questions

markets in the eastern united states

prices in coming weeks would fluctuate along with the temperature 
in opec in advance of the regularly scheduled meeting in november

said

another change in its production ceiling at the next meeting

columbia pictures entertainment inc the 
storied producer of such movies as ghostbusters and tv hits 
like whos the boss agreed wednesday to a 34 billion cash 
buyout by sony corp 
the deal comes 21 months after the huge japanese video and audio 
equipment maker bought cbs records for 2 billion it marks the 
biggest step of sonys push into the software side of the 
entertainment business that will provide products such as movies 
and records to complement its stereos televisions and 
videocassette recorders 
the agreement also extends the recent trend of foreign buyouts 
of hollywood studios that has gobbled up mgmua entertainment co 
and 20th century fox 
sony said it intended to allow columbias us management 
independence in daytoday operations but some toplevel changes 
are expected 
columbia said its president and chief executive victor a 
kaufman and its chief operating officer lew korman intend to 
resign on completion of the buyout 
there were published reports that movie producer peter guber was 
expected to replace kaufman guber who coproduced batman 
rainman and flashdance is considered one of hollywoods 
top producers 
the deal should provide a big payday for cocacola co which 
stands to collect 145 billion in gross proceeds from selling its 
49 percent stake in columbia under sonys 27 a share offer 
cocacola signed an option agreement with sony to tender its nearly 
54 million shares of columbia stock subject to approval by 
cocacolas board which is expected to meet monday the investment 
firm allen amp co inc signed an option agreement to sell its 3 
percent stake 
cocacola declined comment on what it intends to do with the 
cash but analysts speculated that it would reinvest in its 
softdrink operations and possibly repurchase some of its stock 
in trading on the new york stock exchange columbia rose 25 
cents a share at 2650 while cocacola rose 50 cents a share to 
6462 
sony reportedly has been looking for a movie studio for more 
than a year in an effort to extend its reach into new areas of the 
entertainment business that it already serves as a dominant maker 
of consumer electronics 
michael schulhof vice chairman of sony corp of america said 
he had held informal discusssions with columbia executives for 
about a year but that the talks got serious only in the past week 
he said sony decided on a proposal this past weekend and presented 
it on monday 
sonys us subsidiary sony usa inc intends to launch its 
tender offer by next tuesday and expects to complete the 
acquisition by early november 
the deal had been widely rumored since monday when columbia 
disclosed it was in buyout talks with a third party that it refused 
to identify sony confirmed early wednesday from tokyo that it had 
made an offer 
columbia chairman donald r keough who also is president of 
cocacola said sony was an ideal buyer 
it has all the right characteristics and very importantly has 
the ability to take the company to its next important step he 
said 
columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major 
hollywood force placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic 
boxoffice revenues through sept 4 according to the trade journal 
variety 
its owns two film studios columbia pictures and tristar 
pictures but its boxoffice results have been considered 
disappointing in recent years among its most recent releases have 
been ghostbusters ii the karate kid part iii and 
casualties of war 
it has been more impressive in television where it has produced 
or distributed 11 primetime series including five new shows 
cocacola has been involved in columbia since 1982 when it 
bought a predecessor company cocacola subsequently launched a new 
studio called tristar pictures in a joint venture with cbs inc 
and home box office inc 
in late 1987 cocacola merged its entertainment business with 
tristar and wound up with 80 percent of the company that was 
called columbia pictures entertainmment it subsequently 
distributed part of its interest in columbia to cocacola 
shareholders and retained 49 percent 
in its statement cocacolas chairman and chief executive 
roberto goizueta said cocacola shareholders have benefited 
significantly from our investment in the entertainment business 
during the decade of the 80s 
but he said the companys core soft drink business offers 
unequaled opportunity to expand our global leadership in the 
1990s 
analysts said columbias huge library of more than 2700 films 
and more than 23000 tv episodes should prove valuable to sony 
in the columbia library are such films such as on the 
waterfront lawrence of arabia the bridge over the river 
kwai kramer vs kramer and tootsie tristar films have 
included the natural and rambo first blood part ii 
its tv programs include designing women and married 
with children as well as syndicated programs such as the 
jeffersons and barney miller its tv library includes the 
series father knows best and route 66 
columbia also operates 820 movie screens in 220 locations 
through its loews theatre management corp 
columbia earned 16 million or 14 cents a share on revenue of 
162 billion in the fiscal year ended feb 28

company plans to market the new diesel fuel at selected 
philadelphiaarea service stations

agency standards scheduled to take effect in 1993 the fuel will 
meet the proposed standard of 05 percent sulfur by weight the 
company said and will maintain a cetane rating of 45 cetane is 
the diesel equivalent of a gasolines octane rating 
in january the armellini trucking co will use the fuel on its

president bush on wednesday urged western 
nations to increase their financial support for poland and a top 
polish official appealed for 15 billion to help his nation cope 
with a period of potentially explosive social conditions 
in his first address to the annual meetings of the international 
monetary fund and world bank bush praised the efforts of the 
solidarityled government to handle the economic crisis facing 
poland 
there may be no greater opportunity before us all today than 
the challenge of poland and more broadly eastern europe where 
countries are in the throes of dramatic political and economic 
change bush told the delegates from 152 nations 
the united states bush said will be in the forefront of aid 
efforts as eastern europes first noncommunistled government in 
four decades struggles with soaring inflation food shortages and a 
huge foreign debt 
he called on the imf and the world bank the top international 
lending agencies and western nations individually to boost their 
aid for poland 
in light of clearly growing needs the recent accession of a 
solidarityled government and our selfevident stake in its 
success we must do more bush said 
however he immediately told reporters hes not prepared to 
increase his 219 million us aid package saying any increase 
will be hinged on the success of the reform measures being drafted 
by the polish government 
the urgency of the situation was stressed by polish finance 
minister leszek balcerowicz who sought immediate assistance during 
a round of meetings with finance officials attending the imf and 
world bank meetings 
balcerowicz told reporters he wanted a 1 billion loan from 
western nations by early next year to provide critical reserves 
needed to stabilize exchange rates but poland also needs up to 
500 million in shortterm trade loans sooner to buy essential 
foreign goods such as fertilizer and medical drugs he said 
the reform process at least in its initial phase will 
proceed in extremely difficult and potentially explosive social 
conditions balcerowicz said pleading for western aid to ease 
the poles hardships 
he said he wasnt disappointed that bush didnt offer any 
specific figures on how much the united states might boost its aid 
proposal saying he expected the details to be forthcoming 
the administration is supporting a 119 million package of us 
economic aid to poland and another 100 million in food aid 
congressional democrats have termed the package woefully inadequate 
and called for more 
polish officials have sought 700 million a year over the next 
three years from the imf and there were indications that the imf 
assistance program could be approved as soon as november 
in his speech bush also stressed the need to keep pushing 
forward with his initiative to ease the 13 trillion burden of 
debt being carried by developing countries in latin america and 
elswhere 
the imf and the world bank have been supporting the effort by 
providing incentives to encourage commerical banks to forgive a 
portion of their loans to poor nations but banks have been 
reluctant to support the plan because it requires them to partially 
forgive old loans then make new loans 
bush made an even more blunt appeal to a group of commercial 
bankers at a white house reception tuesday night lobbying for the 
debtrelief plan put forward by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told reporters 
wednesday that twisting bankers arms was a very foolish thing to 
do 
banks have to make their own decisions in light of their own 
assessment of their longterm interests he said 
later wednesday argentine president carlos menem announced that 
his country had reached agreement clearing the way for an imf loan 
to his nation the third largest debtor in the developing world 
with 60 billion owed 
an imf statement put the loan amount at 14 billion 
menem in a speech after a morning meeting with bush at the 
white house said argentina was facing the most dangerous 
economic crisis in our history because of hyperinflation a huge 
foreign debt and a stagnating economy 
the government must root out the structural causes of 
stagnation he said individual initiative and competitiveness 
within a market framework is the answer

manipulating the price of a publicly traded stock has been fined 
50000 and suspended from the national association of securities 
dealers 
the nasd said wednesday the action was part of a crackdown on

bailey martin amp appel inc was accused of violating the nasds 
antifraud provisions by artificially increasing the price of stock

the brokerage neither admitted nor denied the allegations it 
settled the case by paying the fine and agreeing to the suspension 
two of the firms owners who also were suspended from the 
association denied any wrongdoing they said they had agreed to 
settle the case to prevent a long costly legal fight 
we feel theyve made an enormous mountain out of a molehill 
said donald bailey chairman of bma group ltd the holding company 
that owns bailey martin 
howard m appel a coowner of the firm said the sales involved 
only 30 clients and none had complained to the association which 
regulates overthecounter stocks 
the associations marketsurveillance committee filed a 
complaint in july stating that bailey martin had acquired 70 
percent of northgates stock at 20 cents per share shortly before 
it merged with starcom entertainment international inc a company 
with no operating history or revenues 
after the merger the brokerage increased the price of the stock 
to 3 per share an increase of 1400 percent by purchasing and 
selling shares at higher prices despite limited wholesale and 
retail demand for the stock the complaint said
