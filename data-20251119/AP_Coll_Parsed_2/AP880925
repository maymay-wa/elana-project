and i think that most people know my position on the sanctity of 
life i favor adoption i do not favor abortion 
lehrer question for the vice president anne 
groer mr vice president id like to stay with abortion for 
just a moment if i might over the years you have expressed several 
positions while opposing nearly all forms of government payment 
for it you now say that you support abortion only in cases of 
rape incest or threat to a mothers life and you also support a 
constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most 
abortions but if abortions were to become illegal again do you 
think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway as 
they did before it was okd by the supreme court and the doctors 
who performed them should go to jail 
bush i havent sorted out the penalties but i do know i do 
know that i oppose abortion and i favor adoption 
and if we can get this law changed where everybody should make 
the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and 
sometimes aborted take the let them come to birth and then put 
them in a family where theyll be loved 
and you see yes my position has evolved and its continuing 
to evolve and its evolving in favor of life 
and i had a couple of exceptions that i support rape incest 
and the life of the mother 
sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this 
but its much clearer for me now as ive seen abortion is 
sometimes used as a birth control device for heavens sakes see 
the millions of these killings accumulate 
and this is one where you can have an honest difference of 
opinion we certainly do but no im for the sanctity of life 
and once that illegality is established then we can come to 
grips with the penalty side and of course theres got to be some 
penalties to enforce the law whatever they may be 
q governor 
dukakis well i think what the vice president is saying is that 
hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision 
its as simple as that i dont think its enough to come before 
the american people who are watching us tonight and say well i 
havent sorted it out 
this is a very very difficult and a fundamental decision that 
all of us has to make and what he is saying if i understand him 
correctly is that hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for 
making this choice 
bush i just 
dukakis no let me finish 
bush yes sure 
dukakis let me simply say that i think it has to be the woman 
and the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that 
makes that decision 
and i think thats the right approach the right decision and i 
would hope by this time that mr bush had sorted out this issue 
and come to terms with it as i have 
i respect his right to disagree with me but i think its 
important that we have a position and that we take it and we state 
it to the american people

an associated press panel of six veteran 
debate judges gave michael dukakis a narrow edge over george bush 
in their first presidential debate sunday night 
three judges rated dukakis the winner and three picked bush but 
the democrat got the most points overall on their ballots 144141 
the judges used a scorecard modeled after the kind used in 
collegiate and scholastic debates a perfect score would have been 
180 points 
the judges gave dukakis top marks for presentation and 
organization while bush bested his opponent in refutation and 
reasoning they said they rated the candidates even in evidence 
and crossexamination 
separately an abc poll of 639 registered voters who watched on 
television gave the debate nod to dukakis 44 percent to 36 
percent with 20 percent calling it a tie 
those polled by abc had been contacted by the network prior to 
the debate and at that time 48 percent supported dukakis 46 
percent backed bush and 6 percent were undecided after the debate 
52 percent said they supported dukakis 45 percent supported bush 
and 3 percent were undecided a shift toward dukakis that was too 
slight to be statistically meaningful given the polls 45 percent 
margin or error 
as for the associated press panel of judges james m copeland 
national executive secretary of the national forensic league in 
ripon wis who scored it 2321 for dukakis said bush was 
choppy and fumbling in a lot of his answers dukakis was nervous 
but clearly in command he was more direct and substantive 
james j unger director of the national forensics institute at 
american university in washington and chairman of the ap panel 
gave bush a 2524 edge but said there was no knockout punch by 
either party 
bush did a good job of mixing the words and the music he 
offered a vision of where the country was going and a reasonable 
roadmap of how to get there said unger 
melissa maxcy wade who like unger has judged every presidential 
debate for the ap since 1976 said its the first time ive ever 
heard the candidates laughed at by the audience bush was laughed 
at twice on irancontra and the abortion question and dukakis was 
laughed at on crime 
wade director of forensics at emory university in atlanta 
scored it 2522 for dukakis she said bush rambled while dukakis 
did a good job defending himself on patriotism 
william southworth director of forensics and professor of 
speech at the university of redlands calif scored it 2726 for 
bush in the foreign policy half of the debate he said there 
were so many positions that bush articulated that dukakis never 
responded to 
ld naegelin speech and theater arts consultant for the north 
east independent school district san antonio texas who scored it 
2523 for bush said bush came across with much more sense of 
control than did dukakis i particularly liked his ill take 
all the blame if you give me half the credit 
that was a great line but he immediately stepped on it 
said frank sferra director of forensics at jk mullen high school 
in denver and president of the national forensic league who scored 
it 2321 for dukakis 
dukakis was better organized i thought bush lost it a couple 
of times during the debate said sferra 
the judges watched the debate on television in their own 
hometowns using a scorecard modeled after the american forensic 
association debate ballot for collegiate and scholastic debates 
they awarded one to five points in each of six categories 
reasoning evidence organization refutation crossexamination 
and presentation a 1 was poor 2 fair 3 average 4 excellent and 
5 superior 
each judge could award a maximum of 30 points a perfect score 
would have been 180 
here are the candidates combined scores

labor leaders for bay area rapid transit 
train operators threatened to halt service sunday unless the agency 
stops teaching supervisors how to drive trains as preparation for a 
strike by another union 
since there isnt a strike our unions position is bart 
cannot train people to do our work when were still there on the 
property said hank white president of the amalgamated transit 
union 
although it isnt striking the transit union which represents 
500 station agents and train operators has promised to honor 
picket lines by united public employees union 
the transit agency started classes saturday because of a 
threatened strike at 1201 am monday by 1200 janitors 
maintenance workers and clerks represented by local 790 
at first white threatened to order train operators to get off 
their trains at the end of their routes starting at 2 pm saturday 
unless the classes were canceled 
bart spokesman mike healy said the training was temporarily 
discontinued white said he expected the classes to resume sunday 
if that happens we will instruct our train operators to 
complete their runs but go no farther than the end of the line and 
then to stand by the trains and await further instructions white 
said saturday night 
were not going to stand by and let management learn to drive 
our trains when were not even on strike white said 
meantime some 100000 commuters face the threat of gridlock 
this week as both sides in a contract dispute predict a strike 
against the 71mile train system 
a state mediator saturday succeeded in getting representatives 
from bart and the united public employees union to resume 
negotiations but initial efforts at averting the strike failed

abelson but its not looking too good 
itll be holy hell said 29yearold tracy hughes a bank 
teller who relies on bart to get her to san francisco from her 
oakland home

a car it would increase the number of rushhour vehicles that now 
compete for position on the 84mile san franciscooakland bay 
bridge by 50 percent 
the disputed contract proposals involve profits from retirement 
fund investments union activity during work hours sick leave 
restrictions and overtime

thousands of japanese waited in the rain outside 
the imperial palace sunday to pray for emperor hirohito but the 
health of the worlds oldest monarch remained precarious 
imperial officials said the 87yearold emperor continued to 
hemorrhage and his condition remained serious although his 
temperature declined sunday from the dangerous level of saturday 
it appears that his internal bleeding is continuing 
imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda told reporters 
sunday 
imperial officials said the emperors temperature at 
midafternoon was 984 compared to his normal body temperature of 
about 959 and his pulse rate was 84 
they said the emperor received another blood transfusion sunday 
of 85 pints bringing the total of his transfusions since last 
monday to 553 pints 
the officials said the large amounts of blood given the emperor 
to replace that lost from bleeding had reduced his bloods ability 
to coagulate and made it more difficult to stop the hemorrhaging 
thousands of people ignored a sunday morning rain and waited 
outside the palace in central tokyo to pray for the emperors 
health and sign registries for wellwishers more than 175000 have 
signed 
on saturday relatives arrived in black sedans after the palace 
announced the monarchs temperature was rising rapidly by 
midafternoon it hit 1026 degrees the highest since hirohito 
vomited blood after an intestinal hemorrhage late monday the fever 
dropped to 1002 saturday evening 
court physicians gave the emperor 128 pints of blood through 
the day after finding signs of further intestinal bleeding they 
gave him 085 pints friday plans to administer highcalorie 
nutrients into hirohitos chest were scrapped after doctors deemed 
the emperor too weak reports said 
aside from two small ice cubes thursday the emperor has been 
unable to take food and continued to receive intravenous treatment 
through a vein in his arm 
for the first time since the crisis began palace officials 
acknowledged hirohitos condition was serious 
kyodo news service and the asahi shimbun japans secondlargest 
newspaper reported the emperor is suffering from cancer of the 
upper intestine in the area where the duodenum and pancreas meet 
asahi said the cancer may have spread to the pancreas 
the agency lodged protests with asahi and kyodo for their 
reports but issued no denials 
the position of the imperial household agency is not to allow 
such speculation while the emperor is still conscious and 
fighting his illness maeda said 
crown prince akihito who assumed the full roster of imperial 
duties thursday continued his daily shuttles saturday to his 
fathers fukiage palace from his nearby residence under the 
constitution the emperor has no real power but signs documents 
already approved by the government and serves as a symbol of japan 
akihito was joined by prince mikasa hirohitos younger brother 
princesses chichibu and takamatsu his widowed sistersinlaw and 
prince hitachi his second son 
maeda said they spoke briefly with the emperor 
prince aya akihitos son planned to interrupt his studies at 
britains oxford university to return to japan the palace said 
foreign minister sosuke uno canceled plans to leave for new york 
sunday to attend the un general assembly the ministry said 
other cabinet ministers also canceled plans to leave tokyo 
news reports said organizers were postponing festivals 
fireworks displays and moonviewing gatherings out of deference to 
the emperor it was an unusual trend not seen even when the emperor 
underwent surgery for the first time in september 1987 
physicians have said the intestinal hemorrhaging was coming from 
the site of the surgery hirohito was diagnosed as having chronic 
pancreatitis and surgeons performed an intestinal bypass 
more than 50000 visitors turned out in the rain saturday to 
sign registries at the palace 
a restaurant owner recited a buddhist prayer outside the palace 
and said japan is not japan without him japans prosperity 
peace and our spiritual wellbeing are owed to him to the greatest 
extent 
the tokyo stock exchanges main index fell during saturdays 
halfday trading session from concern over hirohito analysts said 
there may be no clear logic to why stocks go down when the 
head of the state dies but it creates a serious uncertainty 
said jeff bahrenburg an analyst at merrill lynch in tokyo

network documentaries a string of new books 
an allnight capitol vigil and memorials by former peace corps 
volunteers and pt boat veterans will help commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of the assassination of john f kennedy in november 
but family members plan a lowprofile remembrance much 
different from the 1983 nationally televised observance of the 20th 
anniversary of that fateful day in dallas 
they have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his 
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth said melody 
miller an aide to sen edward m kennedy dmass the senator and 
other family members have said they will not grant interviews 
some family members likely will follow tradition and quietly 
visit jfks grave site at the arlington national cemetery while 
others join family matriarch rose kennedy at her regular daily mass 
at the kennedy compound in hyannis port mass said ms miller a 
longtime kennedy aide who worked for the late robert f kennedy 
despite the familys low profile there are a series of events 
scheduled around the country to remember the 35th president his 
spirit and the events surrounding nov 22 1963 
in washington 500 original members of the kennedycreated peace 
corps will hold a 24hour vigil in the rotunda of the capitol said 
dennis grubb a manhattan investment banker and former kennedy 
advance man who went to colombia in 1961 with the first wave of 
corps volunteers 
grubb said each former volunteer will read brief eulogies many 
written in peace corps diaries during the hours and days following 
the assassination 
after the vigil a memorial service will be held at st 
matthews cathedral with sargent shriver who was jfks 
brotherinlaw and the first peace corps director and bill moyers 
the television journalist who was an assistant corps director 
across the river the green berets will conduct their 
traditional nov 22 wreathlaying ceremony at the kennedy grave 
site but cemetery historian tom sherlock said starting next year 
the green berets will follow the familys lead and hold the 
ceremony on jfks birthday may 29 
on nov 20 surviving members of kennedys 50officer class 
which received its pt boat training in rhode island in the fall of 
1942 will hold a service at the cemetery and their own wreath 
ceremony 
we kept our friendships up all through the years said fred 
rosen a business consultant in dalton ga and former navy 
lieutenant commander who is organizing the event its our own 
class reunion 
in boston 25 roses will be displayed near the entrance of the 
kennedy library and admission will be free for visitors that day 
there also will be a special program for high school students who 
have no memory of president kennedy and the impact of his death on 
the world said library spokesman frank rigg 
that day is usually a quiet one here rigg said its more 
a day of quiet reflection and meditation 
i usually go to church light a candle and have a drink 
said david f powers one of jfks closest associates who is the 
librarys curator 
in dallas preparations continue for a museum at the texas 
school book depository where assassin lee harvey oswald gunned down 
kennedy as the presidential motorcade rode through dealey plaza 
the museum will not be ready until next year 
in pennsylvania scholars and researchers who have devoted much 
of the past quarter century to investigating the kennedy 
assassination will gather at the university of pittsburgh for a 
series of seminars 
but television is likely to dominate the anniversaryrelated 
activities 
in addition to a string of local jfk specials cbs nbc and pbs 
all are planning extensive primetime features on the assassination 
cbs news will air a twohour special nov 17 anchored by dan 
rather that will show highlights of the networks original 53 
hours of live coverage 
it starts with the bulletin that interrupted as the world 
turns on nov 22 and ends with the burial of president kennedy 
said cbs spokeswoman donna dees walter cronkite was the anchor at 
the time and rather who is now the networks anchorman was the 
new orleans bureau chief and lead reporter in dallas 
nbc plans a twohour documentary the night of the anniversary 
anchored by tom brokaw that will feature old footage along with 
interviews 
pbs has two jfk specials a nov 15 segment of the series 
nova will focus on new analyses of assassination evidence 
we undertook an investigation using modern science and 
technology of the physical evidence connected to the assassination 
of president kennedy including ballistics acoustics photographic 
evidence and autopsy evidence said producer robert richter 
we have developed some information that is new that has 
previously not been developed and we have new findings that have 
previously not been available weve hired our own experts and they 
have conducted tests for us 
richter said in addition to producing a threedimensional 
computerized model of dealey plaza pbs received permission from 
the kennedy family to examine photos taken at the autopsy 
another pbs special scheduled for nov 21 includes interviews 
with kennedy friends associates and others to try to recapture 
the impact of the kennedy assassination and its meaning 25 years 
later said david merrill a spokesman at wnet in new york 
abc had no plans for a jfk special although the network is 
working on a miniseries on the kennedy clan based on historian 
doris kearns goodwin book the fitzgeralds and the kennedys 
a dozen new jfk books are being published around the anniversary 
some celebrate kennedys life and times including a compilation 
of his speeches statements and writings by former aide theodore 
sorenson a biography and an assembly of life magazine photographs 
others focus on the assassination such as a collection of new 
letters from leading political sports and entertainment figures 
discussing their recollections of the assassination and its impact 
on their lives including contributions from michael dukakis and 
george bush 
and several books talk about assassination theories old and 
new

trees forest upon forest of them are being 
advanced as one of mankinds best friends for future efforts to 
combat global overheating from the greenhouse effect 
right now however trees represent one of the earths worst 
enemies 
left alone trees are storage sinks that consume large 
quantities of carbon dioxide the worst of the greenhouse gases 
that scientists say are collecting in the atmosphere and trapping 
heat that once escaped into space 
but a tree felled by a logger or consumed by fire is doubly 
dangerous not only will it no longer consume carbon dioxide its 
death releases stored carbon dioxide to join the atmospheric 
accumulation that scientists say will produce major global climate 
changes in the 21st century 
the scientists warnings are coming at a time when forests 
particularly in developing nations are being destroyed at record 
rates the senate energy and natural resources committee was told 
last week 
focusing on the role of forests in the greenhouse equation the 
committee heard that the headlinegrabbing forest fires that 
ravaged some 4 million acres of the american west this summer were 
relatively small potatoes 
it is generally agreed that global deforestation particularly 
in the tropics accounts for approximately 20 percent of the annual 
injection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere said daniel 
dudek senior economist for the environmental defense fund 
annually forest destruction producing these emissions equals 
an area slightly larger than the state of indiana or more than 
245 million acres he said this global total dwarfs our own 
domestic losses this summer 
david wirth senior attorney with the natural resources defense 
council said that because of massive destruction of forests 
brazil currently ranks third after the united states and the 
soviet union in overall contribution to the carbon burden of the 
atmosphere 
cutting down tropical forests to bring land into agriculture is 
especially critical in the amazon basin according to robert 
mcneal of nasas earth sciences and applications division 
if only half of the amazon basin were covered with forests it 
would absorb 20 percent of the carbon which is presently released 
into the atmosphere globally he said 
he also said the basin is the source of about 12 percent of the 
methane another greenhouse gas that reaches the atmosphere from 
wetlands replacing forests with wetlands or rice agriculture would 
likely mean more methane production in the tropics he said 
committee witnesses said that unlike the united states and 
europe which actively plant new trees to replace harvested 
forests many third world trees are not replaced 
only a very small percentage of the worlds tropical forests 
are being managed said richard bissell assistant administrator 
of the us agency for international development which is now 
stressing resource management to countries receiving its assistance 
planting new forests to absorb carbon dioxide sounds like a 
simple solution until its magnitude is considered 
sequestering five gigatons per year of carbon from the 
atmosphere an amount roughly equal to current annual additions 
would require between 128 billion and 165 billion acres of new 
plantation forests dudek said by comparison the total land 
area of the united states is 227 billion acres 
gregg marland of the environmental sciences division of oak 
ridge national laboratory estimated that under current us forest 
management practices this nation would need about 4 billion acres 
of trees to offset its emissions of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere from all sources 
the witnesses said a minimum antigreenhouse strategy requires 
that new sources of carbon to the atmosphere should be offset by 
carbon traps such as new trees 
marland gave a formula for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions 
from a coalfired 1000 megawatt power plant surround it with 
sycamores spaced four feet apart to a radius of 153 miles and 
harvest the trees every four years because younger trees absorb 
more carbon dioxide than mature trees 
gary moll vice president of the american forestry association 
said third world tropical forests are not the only places trees are 
being lost 
our urban forests are dying he said a 1987 survey done 
by the association indicated that on average four urban trees are 
dying or being removed for every new one planted today he said 
we estimate that there are somewhere on the order of 100 
million tree spaces in urban communities where new trees are 
urgently needed moll said planting those trees could result 
in a savings of as much as 18 million tons of carbon dioxide 
production a year 
dale robertson chief of the us forest service said that trees 
offer a partial solution to global warming but he sounded an 
ominous note about the droughts that scientists say will be part of 
the greenhouse process 
robertson said the dry years have had a serious effect on our 
forest resources sparking killer fires weakening seedlings and 
leaving droughtstressed trees more susceptible to insect attack 
a serious potential effect of a change in our worlds climate 
would be changes in tree growth and yield robertson said

populations of the pacific islands under us 
jurisdiction are skyrocketing but departures are holding down 
growth in puerto rico the census bureau reported sunday 
leading in growth was the island of guam where net immigration 
helped boost population sharply 
both military personnel and civilian workers from the 
philippines helped increase guams population the report said 
between 1980 and 1987 the population of guam jumped by 24400 
or 231 percent to 130400 the bureau said of the increase 
5200 were immigrants 
the northern mariana islands were second in growth increasing 
211 percent to a total of 20300 people last year this increase 
was largely from births however 
and american samoa added 19 percent to its population to climb 
to 38400 also due to an increase in births 
on the other side of the nation the us virgin islands had 
population growth of 98 percent to a 1987 total of 106100 people 
natural increase overcame the departure of 4400 people to keep 
growth ahead of the us national average of 74 percent 
that was not the case however with puerto rico where the 
departure of 227000 residents between 1980 and 1987 held the 
islandss overall growth to just 30 percent during the period 
puerto ricos total population was 3292000 last year up 
95000 from the 1980 census

the two schools 15 miles apart are now in different leagues 
and no longer play each other 
the codger bowl was dreamed up by actor john crawford who was 
known as cleve richardson when he played for the bulldogs crawford 
said he wanted to make amends for a dropped pass during the 1938 
game and he caught all four passes thrown to him saturday 
if i had the speed i had 50 years ago i would have gone all 
the way he said of one of his receptions 
rules of the onehanded touchfootball game were casual the 
teams played with eight men to a side to simplify the action and 
make passing easier there were unlimited timeouts and 
substitutions after playing 12minute quarters in the first half

five lootings in rangoon and that two mobs violated the 8 pm4 
am curfew imposed by the new military regime the looters were 
after rice gasoline and corrugated iron sheets it said 
the bloodiest incident occurred when security forces shot seven 
people to death while halting a crowd of 100 looters sunday night 
at the stateowned five star shipping line near rangoon river the 
radio said 
it said two others were killed when security forces dispersed a 
mob of 1000 people looting a government rice warehouse and three 
died while looting of another government warehouse 
the government says security forces have killed more than 250 
civilians mostly people described as looters since the sept 18 
coup western diplomats believe more have died including many 
unarmed demonstrators who marched to demand democracy after 26 
years of authoritarian rule 
security officials in thailand said sunday that burmese student 
leaders have been fleeing across the border almost daily after the 
military crackdown drove them underground 
pinit sunantha a border patrol police official in northern tak 
province of thailand said student leaders have been crossing into 
thailand almost daily but did not provide an exact figure 
a group of 62 students teachers and villagers crossed the 
narrow moei river into tak on friday some swimming and others 
riding in long boats pinit said 
on saturday a spokesman for burmas strongest ethnic rebel 
group said about 90 student protesters fled to his groups border 
base camps where they may get military training the spokesman for 
the karen national union said about 200 more students were on their 
way to the bases 
a woman who identified herself as from the all burma students 
union telephoned the associated press bureau sunday in rangoon to 
warn students not to proceed to the border area because of the 
danger 
their security condition is extremely grave please try to 
stop them immediately she said before hanging up 
diplomats believe the military apparently established effective 
control of the country after the coup ending street marches and 
breaking up protest centers in dozens of towns nationwide 
rangoon residents have ventured out of their homes only to shop 
and a stateowned newspaper announced strict rules from the road 
transport board requiring pedestrians to walk facing traffic and in 
single file along the side of roads 
no one must stop walk sit or play on the roads without 
sufficient reason said the rules published thursday in the 
working peoples daily 
it had no explanation why the rules were issued and there were 
no reports of government enforcement efforts

syria on sunday rejected lebanons 
3dayold christian military government in favor of a rival 
government declared by its moslem allies two bombs exploded in 
syriancontrolled areas 
the crisis threatened to formally partition the tiny 
mediterranean nation along sectarian lines and rekindle the 13year 
civil war which killed 150000 people 
syrias althawra daily which speaks for president hafez 
assads government branded the christian cabinet of army commander 
gen michel aoun a military coup detat against legitimacy 
this government not only constitutes a coup against legitimate 
state institutions and laws but it is also a coup against the 
historic chance to elect a new president and pave the way for 
national reconciliation and salvation it said in an editorial 
syria the main power broker in lebanon backs the fiveman 
cabinet of sunni moslem prime minister salim hoss which includes 
the two main moslem militia chieftains druse warlord walid 
jumblatt and shiite leader nabih berri 
the syrians maintain an estimated 40000 troops in north and 
east lebanon as well as in moslem areas of beirut with their druse 
and shiite allies they control 70 percent of the country lebanon 
has 4036 square miles and 4 million people 
police said attackers fired a rocketpropelled grenade into a 
hotel in syriancontrolled moslem west beirut during the night 
gutting an unoccupied third floor room 
an hour later a dynamite bomb exploded near a syrian army 
checkpoint a block from the hotel police reported no one was 
injured in either attack 
firemen quickly put out the fire at the heavily guarded bristol 
hotel where robert franjieh son of syrianbacked former president 
suleiman franjieh has been staying since his father announced his 
candidacy in lebanons abortive presidential election 
an aide said the younger franjieh left his fourth floor suite 
for the familys summer resort of ehden in north lebanon hours 
before the grenade attack 
no one claimed responsibility for either incident but they and 
a string of bombings and attacks on syrian forces over the last 
year appeared to be aimed at discrediting syrias peacekeeping role 
in west beirut 
the deadlock stemmed from parliaments failure to elect a 
successor to president amin gemayel before his sixyear term 
expired at midnight thursday 
aoun a maronite catholic was named prime minister by gemayel 
minutes before his term ended 
hoss cabinet is all that remains of a national government under 
gemayel a maronite but that administration fractured along 
sectarian lines rarely even consulted with him and had not held a 
full session for years 
the moslem leaders had threatened to declare a breakaway state 
in territory controlled by their militias if gemayel handed over 
power to a christianled cabinet 
under an unwritten covenant lebanons president must be a 
christian the prime minister a sunni moslem and the parliament 
speaker a shiite moslem 
alas this appears to be it lamented beiruts 
moslemcontrolled voice of the nation radio station unless a new 
president is quickly elected and this seems to need a miracle 
lebanon is irrevocably partitioned 
parliament failed three times from aug 18 up to gemayels 
departure to elect his successor because militant christians 
rejected two syrianbacked candidates suleiman franjieh a close 
friend of assad and parliamentary deputy mikhail daher 
hoss became acting premier after prime minister rashid karami a 
sunni was assassinated in a bomb explosion aboard an army 
helicopter in june 1987 
on saturday aouns threeman cabinet ordered civil servants not 
to take any orders from the hoss government 
hoss said in a statement broadcast sunday by moslem radio 
stations gen aouns cabinet is illegal and unconstitutional 
therefore it cannot issue orders or directives to anyone 
but aoun appeared bent on pressing his quest for recognition he 
called all the arab ambassadors in lebanon to meet him monday at 
the presidential palace in suburban baabda northeast of beirut

the health ministry on sunday urged israelis to 
combat an outbreak of polio by observing rules of hygiene 
including washing fruit and vegetables with soap and water 
the government set up a task force to improve the nations 
sewage treatment facilities which have been blamed for at least 
nine confirmed cases of polio near tel aviv state radio and the 
health ministry said 
health officials continued vaccination campaigns for the 200000 
people in and around the towns of hadera 30 milies north of tel 
aviv and ramla and lod which are near the city 
the cabinet decided against universal immunization for the 
countrys 44 million population and instead agreed to continue 
checking sewage and vaccinating people where contamination was 
found 
the sea of galilee a main source of drinking water was being 
checked several times a day for purity the radio said 
all soldiers in the army and police officers are to be 
vaccinated in areas where polio cases have been reported the 
government announced earlier 
the health ministry published a notice in sundays newspapers 
which said 
the public is again requested to carefully observe the rules 
of personal hygiene washing hands with soap and water before 
eating and after visiting the toilet and washing fruits and 
vegetables with soap and water 
panicstricken israelis besieged pharmacies to buy 
selfadministered vaccines and some said they were boiling water 
before drinking 
we are simply terrified said a woman living in tel aviv 
who spoke on condition of anonymity on the army radio they will 
vaccinate us all for sure they just dont want to frighten us 
health officials denied that israel faced an epidemic but the

social initiatives from welfare to child care 
are hanging in the balance as congress draws toward adjournment 
increasingly impatient and preoccupied with presidential politics 
in a year of rhetoric about the american family lawmakers have 
yet to complete action on major initiatives to raise the minimum 
wage expand and improve child care reform the welfare system and 
guarantee leave to workers with pressing family responsibilities 
a number of appropriations bills including one providing about 
300 billion for the defense department have been approved in some 
form but differences remain between the house and senate versions 
also on the incomplete roster is the biggest environmental bill 
of the 100th congress a revision of the clean air act to 
strengthen the battle against urban air pollution acid rain and 
airborne toxic substances 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva has warned 
senators to be prepared for saturday sessions if the 100th congress 
is to end by oct 16 two weeks beyond the original target date 
for finishing business 
the senate has been mired for days on a bill to raise the 
minimum wage from 335 to 455 over three years unable to cut 
off a filibuster mounted by conservative republicans the week 
ended with no resolution and a vow to try again this week 
republican presidential candidate george bush has become 
involved in the debate saying last week he would support a modest 
increase in the minimum wage but only if it is coupled with a 
lower training wage 
the minimum wage family leave and child care bills all have 
become entangled in presidential politics with democrats trying to 
get bushs running mate sen dan quayle rind to take positions 
on social measures he has opposed in the past 
house democrats jumped on a bush comment last week which seemed 
to endorse the family leave act opposed by the administration 
saying in a letter that they would welcome his support 
the family leave bill opposed by small business lobbies is 
scheduled for consideration this week the measure would guarantee 
workers with a newborn newly adopted or very ill child at least 10 
weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave workers with serious medical 
problems themselves would be entitled to at least 15 weeks of leave 
without losing their jobs 
welfare negotiators were meeting monday to discuss the latest 
offers and counteroffers on an overhaul bill that would bolster 
child support payments from absent parents and create a major jobs 
training and education program for welfare recipients 
we havent given birth yet but were about in the ninth month 
of gestation said rep hank brown rcolo as he emerged from a 
meeting friday 
his colorado colleague republican sen bill armstrong was 
slightly less optimistic about the bills prospects were just 
right on the brink again he said the conferees clearly want 
a bill the question is can we get something we can sell to our 
colleagues 
the question is particularly acute in the house where a handful 
of negotiators led by rep augustus hawkins dcalif are firmly 
opposed to a work requirement for twoparent families on welfare 
the reagan administration is just as firm about its insistence that 
the requirement be included 
the latest senate offer adds a degree of flexibility to the work 
requirement and phases it in starting in 1991 the changes didnt 
move hawkins according to his spokesman jay butler 
but other negotiators appeared headed toward compromise with a 
final overhaul costing about 3 billion in the offing if they 
reach agreement hawkins and his followers will be outnumbered 
sens christopher dodd dconn and orrin hatch rutah 
reportedly have agreed on major elements of a compromise 
bipartisan child care bill based on the democrats 25 billion act 
for better child care services 
the bill would help lowincome and to a lesser extent 
middleincome families pay for child care and would require child 
care homes and centers receiving federal money to conform to 
minimum federal health safety training and staffing standards 
the powerful national education association along with the 
parentteachers association the american civil liberties union and 
other groups are mounting a campaign against the bill because 
churchsponsored day care programs would be eligible for aid 
but if the senate ends up passing a popular bipartisan bill the 
house is expected to resist the lobbying pressure and follow suit 
closeddoor negotiations over the air legislation have been 
going on for weeks on both sides of the capitol lawmakers are 
divided over whether congress can agree on the complicated package 
in the remaining weeks of the session 
slated for house consideration this week is legislation to 
authorize the corps of engineers to build about 20 new water 
projects around the nation the projects still need separate 
appropriations legislation before they can get under way the tight 
money situation had caused congress to vote no money for new 
projects this year

homeless activist mitch snyder said sunday 
that efforts by the city transit authority to keep homeless people 
from finding shelter in subway station entrances are absolutely 
revolting 
the city installed permanent barriers earlier in the day at the 
entrances to several downtown subway stops to prevent entry to the 
stations after the subways stop running at night 
homeless people had used the areas for shelter at night but 
city transit officials complained that they also littered the 
stations and used them as a bathroom in the morning 
this is intended to permit the authority to continue to 
provide a clean and safe transit environment for riders and 
employees said beverly silverberg spokeswoman for the 
washington metropolitan area transit authority 
snyder said his group the community for creative nonviolence 
would meet to decide how to respond 
i think its absolutely revolting especially with the 
approach of cold weather he said what theyve done is to drive 
a fair number of people away from those cracks and corners where 
they found a little bit of warmth 
metro officials placed temporary grates at the entrance of one 
downtown stop last year to block entry after the subway station 
closed at night homeless activists responded with protests and 
sitins 
the permanent barriers electronic garagetype doors and 
decorative bars replaced the temporary structure at that station 
and were installed at three other stations officials said

the dream of creating roomtemperature 
superconductors is impossible unless scientists come up with 
materials different from those they are now developing new studies 
suggest 
superconductors transmit electricity without resistance various 
copper oxides are now the best superconductors under development 
but have so far worked only if chilled to at least 234 degrees 
below zero fahrenheit 
commercially available superconductors must be kept much colder 
with liquid helium an expensive and cumbersome process 
researchers believe that if they can create roomtemperature 
superconductors it may be feasible to build faster smaller 
computers cheaper superefficient power transmission lines 300 
mph trains that float above tracks and extraordinarily powerful 
magnets to help produce electricity from nuclear fusion 
it will not be possible with this class of copper oxide 
materials to get roomtemperature superconductivity said 
california institute of technology chemist william a goddard who 
will present his study here monday during the american chemical 
societys annual meeting which started sunday 
when electricity is transmitted by normal conductors some 
electricity is converted to heat and lost because of resistance as 
electrons move through the conducting material just as swimmers 
encounter resistance as they move through water 
electricity flows through superconductors without resistance 
like a swimmer who could take one stroke and glide through the 
water forever 
the theoretical study by goddard and his graduate students was 
based on laws of physics and previous experiments on superconductor 
behavior it produced a single mathematical equation to describe 
superconductivity 
the equation suggests somewhat warmer temperatures for 
superconductivity but predicts there is no way to fabricate copper 
oxides to work as superconductors at temperatures higher than minus 
54 f 
in another study to be presented monday university of georgia 
chemist r bruce king produced a less detailed equation by 
analyzing how atoms bind together in various compounds his 
equation suggests copper oxides wont be able to superconduct 
electricity at temperatures above minus 135 f 
goddards upper temperature limit probably is more accurate 
because his equation is based on more information said thomas f 
george natural sciences dean at the state university of new york 
at buffalo who will preside over the superconductivity session 
king agreed 
minus 54 f is much warmer than dry ice which has a temperature 
of minus 108 f so goddards equation suggests scientists should be 
able to develop copper oxide superconductors that can be 
refrigerated with dry ice which would make them more practical 
than any existing superconductor 
the equations should provide a mathematical basis for developing 
a theory to explain why superconductivity happens george said 
its like knowing the fastest we can go is the speed of 
light he said you cannot develop a theory of relativity 
without that limit 
king said both equations fail to provide any hint about what 
materials could work as roomtemperature superconductors 
scientists for years believed superconductivity was impossible 
at temperatures above minus 418 f they were proved wrong in 1986 
when ibm scientists k alex muller and j georg bednorz in zurich 
discovered the superconducting properties of bariumlaced lanthanum 
copper oxide they won the 1987 nobel prize in physics 
the history of science if full of things that were said to be 
impossible king said my gut feeling is that at some point in 
time somebody is going to find a roomtemperature superconductor 
but its going to require some accidental discoveries known 
principles and materials are not enough to allow the orderly design 
of roomtemperature superconductors

winstonsalem nc ap george bush and michael dukakis 
after months of longrange exchanges headed for a 90minute debate 
sunday that promises an estimated primetime television audience of 
100 million people their first sidebyside look at the 
presidential contenders 
at stake was an edge in a campaign rated a tossup in most 
national polls with many voters undecided or wavering the debate 
starting at 8 pm edt was viewed as a potentially pivotal event 
bush told reporters on the flight from washington that he was 
relaxed and determined to beat dukakis he said the debate was 
the second most important day of his political life after the 
nov 8 presidential election itself 
dukakis told several hundred cheering supporters on his arrival 
that the debate was long overdue its time we had a facetoface 
debate and this is going to be a good one he said 
both campaigns took pains to portray their candidates as 
underdogs 
dukakis is a good debater republican nominee bush recently 
told reporters he is a professional debater and im not 
george bush was the best debater in the republican field 
said dayton duncan the spokesman for democratic candidate dukakis 
it was the first of two debates between the candidates the 
second will take place in los angeles oct 13 or 14 their running 
mates democrat lloyd bentsen and republican dan quayle will 
debate oct 5 in omaha neb 
both candidates flew to north carolina hours before the debate 
to check the lighting and sound systems in wait chapel on the 
campus of wake forest university and to browse through their 
briefing books 
bush and dukakis whose campaign wrangling has turned 
increasingly negative were believed entering the debate with some 
wellrehearsed oneline barbs as well as more complex statements 
of their positions on the issues 
the debate moderator was jim lehrer coanchor of public 
broadcastings macneillehrer newshour 
three journalists john mashek of the atlanta journal and 
constitution abc anchorman peter jennings and orlando fla 
sentinel reporter anne groer were the questioners the republican 
and democratic parties sponsored the event leaving the league of 
women voters to oversee the bentsenquayle showdown 
the format agreed to after weeks of discussions between the two 
campaigns allowed each candidate two minutes to answer a question 
and one minute for rebuttal 
at the end of the debate each candidate was allowed two minutes 
for a closing statement 
other points over which the campaigns haggled were the makeup of 
the panel the height of the podiums and whether the candidates 
would sit or stand 
while the format allowed no opportunity for the candidates to 
question each other they were certain to find ways to raise 
questions that have marked their stump attacks on each other 
where was george has become a democratic campaign slogan 
referring to questions about the vice presidents role or his 
lack of one in the secret sale of arms to iran and other 
controversial reagan administration actions 
dukakis also has repeatedly questioned bushs relationship with 
panamanian military leader manuel antonio noriega who has been 
indicted in the united states on drug charges 
bush has portrayed the massachusetts governor as an opponent of 
most major military weapons systems and criticized his 1977 veto of 
legislation that would have required his states public school 
teachers to lead students in reciting the pledge of allegiance 
bush also has criticized the massachusetts program of weekend 
furloughs for prison inmates 
both candidates watched tapes of their own and their opponents 
debate performances and engaged in mock debates with aides 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman plauyed the role 
of dukakis in bushs practice sessions washington attorney robert 
barnett was the bush standin for the dukakis rehearsals 
dukakis did much of his debate preparation in a boston hotel 
suite that aides said was used by bush during a visit to the city 
months ago spokesman mark gearan said the bush connection to the 
suite was purely coincidental 
in advance both campaigns gave similar assessments of what they 
hoped their candidate would accomplish 
its a chance to show the governor in command of the facts 
knowledgeable to show that hes demonstrated he can be 
president said gearan 
its important for him bush to show that hes presidential 
substantive and in command said bush aide rich bond 
national polls show the race is very close with a large number 
of voters indicating they are undecided or wavering in their 
support for bush or dukakis 
wait chapel the debate site seats about 2400 people but the 
real audience for the candidates confrontation was the tens of 
millions of tv viewers 
traditionally the first of a series of presidential debates 
draws the largest television audience 
estimates of the audience for the first debate in 1984 between 
president reagan and democratic challenger walter f mondale ranged 
as high as 132 million voter turnout for the presidential election 
was fewer than 100 million 
its the beginning of a new phase of the campaign sen bill 
bradley dnj said after a debate practice session with dukakis

richard nixon says the 1988 battle for the 
presidency has been reduced to the trivial superficial and 
inane as george bush and michael dukakis play to the limitations 
of television and stress style over substance 
the former president said in an essay published in sundays 
editions of newsday that serious speeches by republican nominee 
bush and democrat dukakis on the economy and foreign policy have 
received relatively little attention from the electronic medium 
they have found that the surest way they could make the 
evening news was to be silly irresponsible or both he said 
television commentators breathlessly inform us that bush eats 
pork rinds and that dukakis has a 25yearold snow blower 
nixon also predicted that the debates between bush and dukakis 
starting with the matchup sunday night in winstonsalem nc 
will have the biggest impact on the election in the history of 
presidential debates 
after what happened to me in the 1960 debates i consider 
myself an expert on what not to do nixon said 
political analysts have said that a nervous haggardlooking 
nixon was outpointed by an assured authoritative john f kennedy 
who gained in public opinion polls after the debates and squeaked 
to a win in the general election 
nixon said the candidates should not get bogged down in facts 
and must remember that how he looks is more important than what 
he says 
it means being strong but not belligerent confident but not 
cocky he wrote above all a candidate should be presidential 
which means avoiding petty cheap shots at his opponent 
he suggested that bush and dukakis avoid clever oneliners 
because most of their audience already will have heard them before 
and might think the candidates are being patronizing 
try to educate the voters but dont talk down to them always 
remember that people are smarter than you think they are and many 
of them are smarter than you are he said

winstonsalem nc ap reporters gave republican nominee 
george bush two dozen christmas cards sunday in a joking reminder 
of his campaign blooper in misstating the date of the japanese 
attack on pearl harbor by three months 
during the flight from washington for his televised debate with 
democratic rival michael dukakis the vice president dutifully 
opened each card within two hours he had written a reply to each 
writer 
to all at cbs well almost all merry christmas bush wrote 
on one note perhaps recalling his testy encounter with cbstv 
anchorman dan rather earlier this year 
its a very tense kind of moment here in history do i want to 
see this what youre going to give me bush said as he walked 
down the aisle of the plane in response to a message that the press 
corps had something for him 
he read each inscription read my lips merry christmas one 
card said paraphrasing his own line about no new taxes 
as the scene was recorded by a network television camera bush 
began making up inscriptions instead of reading what was written 
you have been superb on the campaign trail he claimed one 
card read his wife barbara pretending to read another card 
said were all behind you mrs bush said that another one 
read good luck in the debate i know youre the best man 
going by bushs faulty calendar sunday sept 25 would be 
christmas day he made his threemonth mistake during a speech 
before an american legion convention when he said the anniversary 
of pearl harbor was sept 7 instead of dec 7 
earlier in washington bush had joked about the debate with 
dukakis and told reporters heres my key line who would have 
thought wed be debating christmas night sept 25

nasa postponed the start of the 
countdown for space shuttle discovery by eight hours sunday because 
of lagging preparations but still aimed for a thursday morning 
liftoff 
were still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and thats 
the plan said launch director bob sieck 
the countdown was rescheduled to begin at 8 am edt monday for 
the first manned american space flight since the challenger blew up 
over the atlantic 32 months ago 
the space agency had added 27 unprogrammed hours to the 
countdown as insurance for lastminute problems and sieck said 
eight hours of that time would be used in advance to complete the 
work of replacing panels and work platforms 
we dont want those people to have to do that under the gun 
with the clock counting he said so we said take all the 
time it takes and well delay the call to stations to accommodate 
that 
nasa had planned to start the countdown at midnight but 
buttoning up the aft end of the spaceplane akin to closing 
the hood on a car was delayed by a problem that had the potential 
of postponing the launch for two days 
low voltage readings were found in an electrical circuit that 
triggers the explosive charges used to separate the shuttle from 
its fuel tank when the tank is empty eventually engineers 
determined that the fault was in a ground circuit which does not 
affect the flight 
the winged spaceplane rides aloft attached at three points to 
the 154footlong external tank at 8 minutes into flight just 
before the shuttle reaches orbit the explosive devices release the 
tank and it breaks up in the atmosphere as it falls toward the 
indian ocean 
discoverys launch date has been changed five times in the past 
as new problems cropped up in getting ready for sts26 the 26th 
mission of the space transportation system 
the cape canaveral area was bracing for an influx of visitors 
comparable to the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981 when 
more than a million crowded the roads outside the launch center 
the renewed interest too was evident at the press site where 
4500 representatives of the news media applied for credentials by 
contrast there were 500 journalists here when the challenger 
exploded on jan 28 1986 73 seconds after liftoff 
when discovery lifts off with five veteran astronauts aboard 
it will be a far different vehicle than on its six previous 
flights the orbiter has had 210 changes and the solid fuel rockets 
had 145 
the booster rockets which supply more than 70 percent of the 
power to get the shuttle off the ground were of the greatest 
concern since it was the righthand rocket that leaked flaming gas 
and doomed the challenger with its seven astronauts 
the joints of the segmented boosters which permitted the leak 
have been completely redesigned and have been tested in five 
fullscale firings but their only real test will come when the 
discovery lifts off its seaside pad the same one used for the 
first time for challenger 
the accident grounded the manned space program for the 
intervening 32 months and caused a complete rethinking in official 
attitudes toward the shuttle the air force which was to have been 
nasas biggest customer taking onethird of shuttle space for 
satellite deliveries has been building its own fleet of 
expendable rockets 
because of the extensive redesign nasa is treating the flight as 
it did the first the hold time in the countdown sequence a 
cushion to fix any problems that might crop up adds up to 40 
hours almost equalling work time 
its as safe as the designers could make it merlino told 
reporters sunday 
navy capt frederick h hauck and his fourman crew of 
astronauts will fly to the launch site from their houston training 
center monday afternoon for last minute briefings and some practice 
landing on the kennedy runway in an aircraft that handles like a 
shuttle 
discoverys cargo will be a 100 million communications 
satellite that nasa needs for communications with future shuttles 
and 11 scientific experiments

one african in four cannot afford to eat enough 
for an active working life and the number of hungry is rising the 
world bank reported sunday 
edward v k jaycox the banks vice president for africa 
released a report saying 1037 million africans are among the 
food insecure 
communist ethiopia buffeted by wars and drought has the 
largest number 147 million nearly half its population it is 
followed by nigeria with 137 million and zaire with 12 million 
both with close ties to the united states 
chad somalia zambia and mozambique have higher percentages 
but their population is smaller egypt is the best off among the 36 
countries listed with only 4 percent of its population about 17 
million in the food insecure category 
other egyptians get at least 2200 calories a day which jaycox 
says is the minimium needed for a working person 
in the 1980s both the proportion and the total number of 
africans with deficient diets have climbed and will continue to 
rise unless special action is taken the report said 
barely a quarter of africans lived in countries where food 
consumption was increasing in the 1980s down considerably 
from about twothirds in the 1970s 
production of food grains has been declining for two decades 
jaycox told a news conference 
in some places food may be scarce but more often people just do 
not have the money to buy it he said ethiopia is the poorest 
country on the world banks list with average income estimated at 
120 a year less than 35 cents a day 
the report calls for action so that within five years half to 
twothirds of the countries below the sahara will have carried out 
programs to cover a majority of the regions most needy 
but jaycox said it would be futile to propose anything so 
specific as abolishing hunger by the year x 
we are not calling for a massive new injection of financial 
resources here he said 
he said billions have been spent on aid for africa but the 
programs have not worked well he said many solutions do not need 
new aid money 
a major one is for african governments to pay higher prices to 
african farmers jaycox said the bank completed negotiations with 
ethiopia that will give farmers more incentives and reduce state 
confiscation of crops which he said started before the present 
government took power 
but food security does not mean that every african country 
should grow all its own food he said 
if a farmer in the ivory coast makes 8 a day growing cotton 
which nobody can eat theres no point in his growing maize at 2 a 
day he said 
jaycox said some african governments pay their own farmers too 
little which discourages them from producing the governments then 
buy food from abroad and subsidize its sale in the towns 
he said these policies are worse than the policies of wealthier 
countries in america and europe where governments sell their 
surplus food cheap to benefit their own farmers at the expense of 
the taxpayer 
jaycox said the african policies encourage people to shift to 
rice and wheat which are uneconomical to grow in africa away from 
the sorghum and maize that their farmers traditionally have raised

billy carter the former first brother 
and beerdrinking good ol boy whose candor and business ventures 
amused and sometimes embarrassed the carter administration died 
sunday of cancer he was 51 
the brother of former president jimmy carter suffered for a year 
with pancreatic cancer the disease that killed his father and a 
sister and lived longer than his doctors expected he died three 
days after leaving the hospital for his home in this southwest 
georgia hamlet 
carter died quietly and peacefully in his sleep with his 
family at his bedside according to a statement issued by the 
carter presidential center on behalf of the former president and 
his family 
he had struggled courageously with his illness never losing 
his sense of humor and always more concerned about those who loved 
him than about himself the family said 
billy carter who once defined himself as a beerdrinking good 
ol boy was forced into the spotlight when his older brother 
rocketed from their tiny hometown into the white house 
he put his name on a brand of beer that flopped got into hot 
water with remarks denounced as racist or antisemitic accepted 
money from libya and was forced to sell some properties to pay a 
debt to the internal revenue service 
but underneath the mask of the court jester was a perceptive 
man an avid reader a fighter who refused to go down quietly under 
the pressures of alcoholism or cancer 
last april carter acknowledged he enjoyed being a part of the 
national scene during his brothers presidency from 1977 to 1981 
ive been asked a thousand times i guess what i would do if 
i had it to do over again he added and i said probably the 
same thing because if i had to do it over again id probably 
screw up worse the second goround 
he was born william alton carter iii the youngest of four 
children he was a child with a stutter who did badly in school 
while his siblings shone 
billy was 16 when his father died in 1953 and jimmy a navy 
officer 13 years his senior moved back home to plains to take over 
the familys peanut business billy chafed under his brothers 
stewardship and soon married his high school sweetheart sybil and 
joined the marines 
carter later drove a truck for the family warehouse then spent 
two years at emory university in atlanta before he was forced out 
because of poor grades and for turning in a term paper written by 
someone else 
he returned to plains in 1964 where he gradually assumed 
control of the peanut business which grew into a 5 million a year 
operation under his stewardship the business was placed in trust 
while his brother was president 
it changed my lifestyle completely he said later i was 
40 years old and went from one extreme to the other just 
overnight 
during his brothers presidency he made no effort to smooth out 
his image he cultivated a redneck personality and was known for a 
quick and often profane wit 
at a canadian bellyflop championship he jumped into the pool 
with a beer in his hand and a rose between his teeth he judged a 
pizza distributors beauty contest he put his signature on the 
label of billy beer but later joked that one reasonshe gave up 
drinking was that the beer was so bad 
i dont know how to describe the appeal but i think people 
cant believe a presidents brother can be like i am he told 
penthouse magazine 
finally his remarks went too far when a black california 
politician named carter gilmore joked that they might be related 
billy responded i hate to say this but weve all left a nigger 
in the woodpile somewhere at a dinner honoring atlanta braves 
pitcher phil niekro billy called him a bastardized jew and a 
polack 
jimmy carter stood gamely by his brother refusing to muzzle 
him joking about billys contributions to the beer industry and 
assuring reporters that billy was a competent capable man 
but the brothers were forced to put some distance between them 
in 1979 after billy carter visited libya and served as host for a 
return visit by libyan officials calling the libyans the best 
friends ive got in the world right now he also disclosed that 
he had accepted 220000 from the libyans to help pay bills and 
various expenses 
in all the carter presidency and the years immediately after 
were tough on the presidents brother 
in 1979 a federal grand jury investigated whether loans to the 
family peanut warehouse were diverted to the presidential campaign 
allegations carter denied he spent seven weeks in an alcohol 
rehabilitation program that year 
in 1981 to help pay a 105000 debt to the irs he sold his 
plains home and the little gas station where he used to hold court 
for reporters he moved to alabama worked as a mobile home 
salesman and returned to plains in 1986 
in september 1987 doctors told him he had inoperable cancer of 
the pancreas which had killed his father james earl carter in 
1953 and his sister ruth carter stapleton an evangelist in 1983 
he underwent an experimental program at emory university 
hospital and in may checked into the national cancer institute in 
bethesda md for what he said might be his last chance the 
only one left except prayer and im trying that too 
one of carters last public appearances came in july when he 
attended the democratic national convention in atlanta 
a funeral service will be held monday in plains where his 
mother miss lillian carter and his father are buried 
in addition to his wife and brother carter is survived by six 
children ages 11 to 31 and sister gloria carter spann

billy carter was never shy about sharing his 
opinions and they were often colorful and profane here is a 
sampling 
on his family i got a mother who went into the peace corps 
at the age of 68 i got a sister whos a holy roller preacher i 
got another sister who rides motorcycles and wears helmets i got a 
brother who thinks hes going to be president of the united states 
im the only sane one in the family 
on sleeping in the white house i didnt like it cause i got 
lost i couldnt find the bathroom and id had 20 beers before i 
went to bed 
on the press i dont believe a damned thing i read the main 
thing that turns me off about the political process is the press 
about 90 percent of you are reporters because you dont have enough 
sense to be anything else 
on his own political preferences im a george wallace 
democrat who voted for jimmy carter 
on his relationship with his brother i dont tell him how to 
be president and he doesnt tell me what to do 
on his alcoholism the toughest part was when i made up my 
mind never to drink again god knows i gave up one of my best 
friends ive found out water can be drunk straight 
on the difference between a redneck and a good ol boy a 
good ol boy is someone that rides around in a pickup truck 
which i do drinks beer and puts em in a litter bag a rednecks 
one what rides around in a truck and drinks beer and throws em out 
the window 
on womens rights i think women have rights they ought to 
have the right to be a good cook and good housekeeper look after 
the baby

finance leaders of industrialized nations 
expressed satisfaction sunday over prospects for noninflationary 
world economic growth but brazils finance minister contended that 
developing nations still were not sharing in the expansion 
despite alarms and jitters the world economy has performed 
well over the past year nigel lawson british chancellor of the 
exchequer told finance chiefs at the annual meeting of the 
international monetary fund and the world bank 
the industrialized nations he said have a good opportunity 
to extend their healthy growth pace without a fresh spurt in 
inflation 
west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg agreed with 
lawsons sentiments during closeddoor discussions with 22 finance 
ministers who make up the interim committee of the international 
monetary fund 
while growth in the industrial countries exceeds earlier 
expectations inflationary pressures have been contained 
stoltenberg said 
the international monetary fund has predicted the world economy 
would expand at a 38 percent pace this year slipping to 31 
percent next year 
but lawson and stoltenberg both urged the united states to pare 
its redink spending further 
the absorption by the united states government for a further 
long period of a sizable share of the worlds net savings would 
not be in anyones interest said lawson 
so we look to the new us administration to take early and 
effective action to reduce its budget deficit still further 
many analysts contend the united states must to keep its 
interest rates higher in order to attract money to finance the 
deficit higher interest rates generally are seen as a drag on 
economic growth 
the us delegation to the conference did not release the 
remarks to the group by newlyinstalled treasury secretary nicholas 
brady but nonus sources who demanded anonymity quoted brady 
as assuring his financial counterparts that the united states 
placed the highest priority on efforts to reduce its deficit 
spending 
brady was making his first appearance at the international 
talks which began last thursday and will run through sept 29 the 
imf and its sister agency the world bank count 151 nations as 
members 
despite the upbeat remarks from industrialized nations finance 
officials of the poorer nations worried they were being left out of 
the gains 
developing countries cannot share the relative optimism 
for the developed world said brazils finance minister mailson 
ferreira da nobrega if conditions do not change no basic 
improvement is expected this year for the developing countries 
da nobrega said the per capita income of latin american and 
caribbean nations was expected to tumble 06 percent this year 
it is clear growth in industrial countries does not trickle down 
to developing countries economies da nobrega said 
he urged the finance ministers to stop thinking that only the 
performance of developed countries economies can have a major 
impact on the recovery of the world economy 
instead da nobrega said the officials should directly attack 
developing countries economic woes with fresh money for poorer 
nations reduced foreign debt payments and removal of trade 
barriers 
da nobrega also cautioned the industrialized countries not to 
overreact to inflation fears and slow their economic growth 
but frances economics minister pierre beregovoy cautioned that 
the international economic recovery remains fragile he said 
there were inflationary tendencies because of the cash injected in 
financial markets by central bankers after last octobers stock 
market crash 
lawson said industrialized nations were prepared to tighten 
monetary policy and bump up interest rates to curb inflation but 
contended that some of the danger signs of a potential resurgence 
of inflation have receded

the race for the democratic nomination to succeed 
retiring us sen lawton chiles has become a heated personal 
battle that some party leaders worry will send a limping candidate 
into the general election 
state insurance commissioner bill gunter head of the powerful 
regulatory department since 1976 and thirdterm us rep kenneth 
buddy mackay emerged at the top of a sixcandidate primary 
field sept 6 and stepped up criticism of each other immediately 
as they headed to an oct 4 runoff 
gunter has cited mackay votes in congress to charge he has 
betrayed israel retirees and veterans appealing to three 
important florida constituencies and said mackay is out of step 
with floridians 
mackay has questioned gunters integrity for accepting campaign 
contributions from the insurance industry he regulates including 
from two companies that later collapsed gunter called mackay 
hypocritical for taking political action committee money 
mackays first television commercial of the runoff campaign 
quotes an orlando sentinel editorial endorsement of mackay 
referring to gunters severe ethical deficiency and calls 
himself the candidate of real integrity 
gunters first commercial shows a 79yearold north miami widow 
and refers to a 1985 deficitreduction package vote in which mackay 
supported freezing the social security costoflivingadjustment 
some people tried to take 228 from ida lawn and it wasnt 
muggers the commercial says it was some washington 
politicians who voted to cut social security buddy mackay was one 
of those politicians 
both democrats come from northcentral florida are nearly the 
same age gunter is 54 mackay 55 and both may be looking at 
their last shot at the senate 
the winner will face wellfunded republican nominee rep connie 
mack iii 
i am sure connie is having a ball and cheering the two 
campaigns on said charles whitehead state democratic party 
chairman im always disappointed when anything happens to help 
the republican nominee 
mark mills campaign press secretary to mack noted that the 
republican nominee after a lopsided primary victory over former 
us attorney robert merkle has stayed on television with 
commercials promoting his positions 
weve had the opportunity to get our message out and solidify 
our support while the two democrats are engaged in a bitter and 
very divisive runoff mills said i think what everybody 
thought this runoff was going to be is coming true the winner is 
going to be battered bruised and broken 
mack a former cape coral bank president and grandson of his 
namesake the baseball hall of fame manager acknowledges the 
bitter runoff is a boost for him 
mack has raised some 32 million and also has 859000 from the 
national republican senatorial committee eyeing florida as one of 
its best chances to pick up senate seats former twoterm 
democratic gov bob graham unseated republican sen paula hawkins 
in 1986 
chiles 58 a democrat who is senate budget committee chairman 
in december cited work burnout and displeasure with the high cost 
of campaigns in announcing his decision not to seek reelection to 
a fourth term 
whitehead as party chairman has twice seen wounded nominees 
fall and mackay and gunter had a hand in one of those losses the 
democrats have a 32 lead in statewide registration but floridians 
in recent years have been ticketsplitters and vice president 
george bush is favored to carry the state for the republicans for 
the eighth time in the last 10 presidential elections 
gunter lost in 1980 to mrs hawkins for the senate after a 
heated primary race involving mackay and incumbent richard stone 
and gubernatorial nominee steve pajcic lost to republican bob 
martinez in 1986 after a divisive runoff

theres no such thing as a mess hall in 
todays military its now an enlisted dining facility the 
cration is also gone replaced by the less lyrical mre short for 
meal ready to eat 
these changes and others are constantly being orchestrated by 
the us armys research and development laboratories assigned to 
develop food for all the armed forces among other tasks 
one of the latest items for gi menus is an allnatural bread 
with a shelf life of three years and tabasco sauce is now a 
required condiment for every fighting man and woman 
army scientists and engineers develop food clothing shelter 
and airdrop equipment in the labs that are spread out on the 
78acre base about 20 miles south of boston but much attention is 
paid to planning the continually evolving menus or what scientists 
call future feeding concepts 
civilians might call most of the food takeout the majority 
is designed for soldiers in combat and must last for three years 
the conception of how war needs to be fought changes and when 
the military rethinks how its going to fight we need to rethink 
food said phil brandler acting director of food engineering at 
the base 
mres replaced the wellknown crations in 1981 the heavier 
canned items that were part of the lore of world war ii and the 
korean and vietnam wars were dropped in favor of a lightweight 
meal in a pouch much of which can be reconstituted in the 
field 
the modern battlefield is more mobile it makes the men 
harder to find and get to and they go off for days at a time 
said brandler they have to be provided with foodstuffs of low 
volume that can be carried around for awhile 
army chefs are also mindful that soldiers ought to like what 
they eat or at least tolerate it 
tastes change said brandler food that we developed for 
the korean and vietnam war no longer is always acceptable 
part of that according to brandler is that the ethnic makeup 
of the army has changed over the years 
we have a higher percentage of vietnamese and orientals he 
said our troops want spicier foods hence the tiny bottles of 
tabasco sauce that surface in each mre 
loss of acceptance is the term given food items scorned by 
soldiers in periodic taste tests according to army food specialist 
sue gagner 
among the food thats been dropped are lima beans ham and 
chicken loaf threebean salad and fruitcake beef stew is on the 
way out after soldiers complained that omelettes were too 
dense they were promptly reformulated 
the first of army rations was established by congressional 
resolution on nov 4 1775 
those daily rations consisted of either beef pork or salt fish 
accompanied by bread or flour three pints of peas or beans one 
pint of milk one pint of indian meal one quart of spruce beer and 
a portion of molasses 
these days along with one of 12 different entrees such as 
chicken a la king or tuna with noodles soldiers are allotted 
crackers with cheese spread freezedried fruit candy cookies or 
cake instant coffee or tea and powders that turn into 
fruitflavored drinks 
most popular foods in the mres are spaghetti and meatballs the 
dried strawberries just add water and bags of brandname candy 
the food is surprisingly palatable and can be heated up in 
minutes 
its relative tastiness is all the more surprising given the 
ambitious shelf life requirements for combat food because food 
must be warehoused for long periods and be available for immediate 
shipment to hot spots the army has developed the bread that still 
tastes pretty good after a few years 
the bread is new and the result of recent technology developed 
at the base no preservatives or chemicals are used instead it is 
baked with a combination of ingredients designed to slow the growth 
of microbes 
you may not find it served at maxims any time soon but the 
bread has enjoyed good acceptance among soldiers and that 
suits its creators just fine 
even after three years according to gerald schulz associate 
director of food engineering they would not be repulsed by it

former veterans administration chief max cleland 
overcame vietnam war wounds to launch a successful political 
career now hes struggling to save it from a new kind of hostile 
fire distribution of a taperecorded sexually explicit 
conversation with a woman 
cleland 46 headed the va under president carter from 1977 
through 1980 he is now georgias secretary of state and is 
considered a possible democratic candidate for governor in 1990 
two weeks ago he went public with what until then had been a 
widely repeated rumor in political circles 
in an interview with the associated press cleland said a 
secretly made tape of a private conversation was being circulated 
by political adversaries to discredit me and the good record ive 
been able to put together 
cleland who is not married said the conversation was with an 
old girlfriend a year or two ago made from my own home on my 
personal private unlisted phone number the girl was single 
and it was a private conversation between us 
the woman has never been identified and cleland has refused to 
say who he believes to be involved in the distribution of the tape 
but there were these other developments the day following 
clelands announcement 
atlanta attorney guy davis who was the gop gubernatorial 
nominee in 1986 told reporters he represents the woman in the 
conversation and had a copy of the tape however he insisted that 
democrats were behind the distribution of it specifically he 
charged that the politically powerful house speaker tom murphy 
sent copies of the tape to democratic county chairmen murphy 
called davis a total liar 
lamar weaver an insurance man in suburban cobb county who 
called himself a friend of the woman told reporters he encouraged 
her to tape conversations with cleland because he felt she was 
being abused weaver said he gave copies of the tape to four 
people murphy among them 
there have been no new revelations since then 
cleland and his top advisers now beginning to assess the 
damage said it appears to have been negligible 
we havent received a negative piece of mail or phone call 
not even anonymously said bill crane clelands press secretary 
after this story broke max had 150 to 160 telephone messages 
waiting for him on his desk all saying were with you youve 
been smeared 
for the most part editorial writers and columnists also have 
rushed to clelands defense among them tom teepen editorial page 
editor of the atlanta constitution 
teepen declared the low level of georgias state politics is 
gouged to new depths by the sickening clandestine distribution of 
the tape on thursday the constitution devoted nearly half 
a page to letters from readers agreeing with teepen 
crane said early indications are that the incident has not 
affected clelands fundraising ability or political standing in 
georgia and said cleland still intends to make a decision about 
future plans sometime after the november general election 
he also said cleland and his advisers have had no second 
thoughts about going public with the issue 
if we hadnt dealt with it the rumors unsubstantiated 
rumors of all shapes and sizes wouldve continued to expand and 
choke us he said 
cleland who lost both legs and an arm in a grenade blast in 
vietnam turned his attention to politics after recovering from the 
injuries he served in the georgia senate from 1970 through 1974 
while carter was governor then became carters va administrator in 
washington 
he was elected secretary of state in 1982 and reelected in 1986

fireworks lit up the sky and gunfire 
and explosions were heard across the capital sunday in what was 
called a display of support for rebels who tried to topple 
president corazon aquino last year 
police said one man was killed and another captured after three 
gunmen in a jeep fired on a police car in suburban quezon city 
during the fireworks display 
meanwhile communist guerrillas killed a woman and her two sons 
and government soldiers gunned down three rebels in separate 
incidents over the weekend the news agency and the military said 
sgt manny siocon said the attack in quezon apparently was 
linked to the fireworks display he said the third assailant 
escaped and police recovered a rifle flares and bundles of 
fireworks from the gunmens vehicle 
police and residents said the fireworks began about 830 pm at 
military camps in the manila area and lasted up to 15 minutes 
a member of the presidential security group told the associated 
press the fireworks explosions could also be heard near the 
presidential palace 
columnist letty jimenezmagsanoc wrote in the progovernment 
philippine daily inquirer sunday that a group called the 
revolutionary association for the peoples freedom would explode 
fireworks across the nation to signal the birthing of a filipino 
movement to free the nation now mired in greed and looting 
there were no reports of displays elsewhere in the country but 
mrs magsanoc said pamphlets published by the previously unknown 
group called for dismantling of the transitional exploitative 
government a reference to the aquino administration police said 
they accept the journalists explanation but refused further 
comment 
she said the fireworks would honor the leaders of a bloody aug 
28 1987 coup attempt in which renegade soldiers led by former 
lt col gregorio gringo honasan tried to topple the aquino 
government at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were 
wounded in the coup attempt 
honasan was captured in december but escaped in april from a 
prison ship in manila bay and remains at large 
he played a key role in the february 1986 military revolt that 
toppled president ferdinand marcos and propelled mrs aquino to 
power 
but honasan became disillusioned with mrs aquino for her 
alleged failure to crush the 19year communist insurgency and 
restore an honest democratic administration 
in capiz on panay island about 200 miles south of manila 
guerrillas saturday strafed the house of boday hulido 30 killing 
her and her two sons the philippines news agency said it said the 
rebels may have been looking for hulidos husband who had just 
been recruited into a new militia force 
in bukidnon province about 550 miles southeast of manila 
soldiers killed three rebels in a clash outside magsaysay village 
early sunday the military said 
lt col antonio zaldua said the soldiers were sent to the 
village after receiving reports that rebels were allegedly asking 
residents for money 
the soldiers recovered firearms medicines foodstuff and a 
radio transmitter from the scene of the firefight the official 
said no government casualties were reported 
in another incident a grenade found by a 12yearold boy 
exploded after he brought it home killing him his two brothers 
and a friend the news agency reported 
fridays grenade blast in the village of udok on panay island 
killed gerry nadong 9 angelo nadong 12 and herandi nadong 23 
their friend hernani fernando age unknown died in a hospital 
the report said six other people were injured

col jorge vallejera as saying the grenade may have been dropped 
accidentally by military planes that had attacked a communist new 
peoples army camp in the area

administrative officer under namphy who took power after 
duvaliers ouster 
in a declaration sunday haitis 10 catholic bishops backed the

the dreaded tonton macoutes duvalier familys private militia and 
excludes from the civil service all those who actively cooperated 
in perpetuating the 29year dictatorship 
we insist on this justice to break the hellish circle of hate 
and vengeance said the statement read over the roman catholic

clevelands largest suburb is running ads 
telling minorities they are welcome in the nearly allwhite 
community but officials say the courtordered campaign is getting 
a lukewarm response 
parma launched the advertising campaign in january on orders 
from a judge who ruled the middleclass suburb of 92000 illegally 
tried to keep minorities out 
the public relations effort has included a booklet for 
prospective residents a threemonth radio campaign and yearlong 
advertisements in three local newspapers including the call and 
post a blackoriented weekly 
the ads proclaim parma welcomes people of all races religions 
and national origins and is an interracial community offering 
the advantages of a comfortable and stable suburban lifestyle 
parma has spent about 70000 on the campaign and signed a 
12000 contract with the cuyahoga plan a countywide fair housing 
organization to answer calls responding to the advertising 
but only 57 calls have come in since the agency began handling 
the inquiries in march said anda cooke the cuyahoga plans 
director of housing information 
a lot of money is put into ads and to get just 57 calls is 
disappointing she said 
the campaign is one of the remedies ordered by us district 
judge frank j battisti in 1980 he ruled that parma officials 
violated the fair housing act which forbids discrimination in 
housing on the basis of race 
the justice department filed suit after parma rejected plans for 
a federally subsidized apartment building for the elderly city 
officials argued the plans did meet building codes but battisti 
agreed with the justice department that there was a pattern of 
opposition to public and lowincome housing in parma 
the 1980 census showed parmas population included 19 percent 
racial minorities overall and 04 percent blacks clevelands 
573822 residents in 1980 included 465 percent racial minorities 
and 438 percent blacks 
among other things battisti told parma to establish a 
fairhousing committee participate in federally subsidized housing 
programs and advertise the availability of such housing 
the city now has 60 units of public housing and also 
participates in a federal rentsubsidy program for lowincome 
residents 
robert s soltis a lawyer who represented the city said parma 
has complied with everything the court wanted and then some the 
order only required newspaper ads we ran radio ads as well and of 
course these things are expensive 
however avery s friedman a fair housing lawyer who was 
appointed special adviser in the case is critical of parmas 
advertising campaign which he said doesnt include information 
about the remedial order or openhousing opportunities 
they came out with their booklet about six months ago saying 
what a wonderful thing it was to live in parma friedman said 
this wasnt just advertising it was intended to portray to 
minorities that it was fair housing 
christopher boyko parmas law director said no amount of 
advertising will change the racial mix of the population moving to 
parma which was one of the fastestgrowing cities in the country 
during the 1960s 
there was never any need to advertise people came to parma in 
natural migrating patterns and that is just the way it 
developed said boyko 
our contention is that if we do everything we can to make 
parma an open community then we cant drag people into our city

its christmas eve the snow is falling bing 
crosby is crooning ill be home for christmas the kids are 
tucked snugly into bed theres talk of santa claus and christmas 
presents 
then the young husband confesses that he has taken a contract 
out on his wife and the hired killer will be arriving any minute 
holidays can be tough sometimes sympathizes a character in 
reckless a dark dizzy and often dangerous black comedy by 
craig lucas that opened sunday courtesy of offbroadways circle 
repertory company 
its heroine rachel doesnt wait for explanations from her 
repentant hubby dressed in a bathrobe and slippers she flees out 
the bedroom window and into the snowy night her escape and 
subsequent education about life are the nightmarish stories of 
reckless a quirky often funny fantasy that grows grimmer as 
it becomes more absurd 
during her journey rachel turns into a female candide 
transported through a dreamlike cloudfilled setting designed by 
loy arcenas this suburban housewife is an eternal optimist no 
matter how badly she is battered by people and events during her 
convoluted travels 
at the beginning of her bizarre adventure this orphan of the 
storm gets picked up at a local gas station by lloyd who brings 
her home to his wife pooty a quadriplegic and deaf mute 
the trio ends up on a tv game show called your mother or your 
wife where lloyd wants to win money so he can pay child support 
to a longforgotten first wife 
rachel gets a job working as a clerk for hands across the sea a 
vaguely humanitarian organization and incurs the jealousy of her 
neurotic supervisor before she finally reaches the end of her 
travels rachel witnesses several murders and has visited various 
psychiatrists including one who practices primal scream therapy 
by the final scene she becomes a psychiatrist herself and ends up 
counseling her own son 
in terms of plot it makes for a breathless evening one that is 
astonishing in its inventiveness in bringing longlost characters 
back together after extended absences 
the comedy threatens to run out of steam several times during 
the play the game show spoof is not as ferocious or as funny as it 
could be but then it would be hard to top some of the reallife 
examples already on television 
in act 2 the laughs eventually give way to a unsettling black 
humor as rachel becomes more aware of the crazy situation she has 
gotten herself into the character and the play become more somber 
as they attempt to define what rachel has done with her life since 
leaving her husband 
rachel personifies a kind of goofy sweetness a quality further 
enhanced by robin bartletts exemplary performance miss bartlett 
is one of those radiant actresses who brings an intelligence and 
intensity to every role they play she did it two seasons ago with 
her performance of an acerbic hooker in the early girl also 
presented by circle rep 
the actress gets some strong support from john dossett as the 
goodnatured but strange lloyd welker white as the silent 
quadriplegic susan blommaert as the jealous coworker and 
particularly joyce reehling as a succession of increasingly weird 
shrinks 
director norman rene gives reckless a thoughtful fluid 
production that makes rachels journey move quickly 
the title of the play pretty much suggests what the playwright 
is doing he doesnt play safe with either his characters or plot 
lucas keeps everything off balance it may make for some awkward 
moments but the end result is an intriguing tilt a play that 
fascinates particularly because you cant secondguess where it is 
going

a test program allowing cameras in state 
courtrooms has resulted mostly in superficial news coverage 
disappointing advocates who had hoped for more substance the judge 
evaluating the experiment says 
at the same time the 18month experiment now about half over 
has not created the disruptions expected by its critics said chief 
administrative judge albert rosenblatt 
if theres no apparent damage and if it doesnt disserve in 
any way the justice system i think its very hard to exclude on 
practical realistic or intellectual grounds rosenblatt said in 
an interview friday 
if its just a clean neutral then the presence of a 
television camera should be no different than wallpaper or the 
color of the rug he said as long as it doesnt disserve its 
a fact of life 
the judge stressed however that it was premature to conclude 
whether the program should be extended past its may 31 expiration 
and he was equivocal in discussing its results so far if it is 
found to be merely inoffensive he said it may not merit the 
administrative burden it has placed on the courts 
fortyfour states allow some photographic coverage of 
courtrooms although the federal court system does not new yorks 
experimental program began dec 1 in four upstate counties and june 
1 statewide rosenblatt is to report on it to the legislature the 
governor and the states chief judge on march 31 two months before 
it ends 
the program allows camera and audio coverage of court 
proceedings by radio and television stations newspapers and 
academic institutions with approval of the presiding judge 
denials can be appealed 
as of midseptember judges across the state had approved 427 of 
482 applications for coverage or 886 percent moreover 
rosenblatt said he has received 255 evaluations of the program from 
judges with only 41 opposed 
lawyers however were divided of 225 who expressed views 88 
were in favor 84 opposed and 53 neutral some lawyers fear camera 
coverage will intimidate witnesses and jurors and impart notoriety 
to their clients 
the greatest concern for the program was that the presence of 
cameras and recording equipment would disrupt court proceedings 
much as they did in the celebrated lindbergh kidnapping trial in 
1935 when radio announcers and cameramen jammed the flemington 
nj courtroom 
those fears have not been realized rosenblatt said largely 
because of the advanced technology of electronic recording 
equipment but he said the greatest hopes for the program that it 
would serve as an educational tool to increase public understanding 
of the court system havent occurred 
an insight into the judicial process is a very healthy thing 
for the community we wanted to see whether that insight can be 
arranged without in any ways detracting from the quality of justice 
that we want to have that in a nutshell is really the basis for 
the experiment rosenblatt said 
id been hopeful that the potential for education would be 
realized to perhaps a greater degree than it has been he said 
weve not had a great deal of documentary coverage weve not had 
a great deal of coverage that goes beyond the very very brief 
segments of what might be a particularly notorious trial 
he said he would review the work of a committee evaluating the 
program conduct public hearings and consider the comments of 
lawyers judges and prosecutors before deciding whether to 
recommend continuing to allow cameras in state courtrooms

communist party leaders meet monday to 
choose a prime minister who can get a grip on polands crumbling 
economy and restore political stability before crucial talks begin 
next month with the opposition 
the second party plenum in a month will discuss formation of a 
government to succeed that of prime minister zbigniew messner 
postwar polands eighth premier 
messner resigned sept 19 with all 19 of his ministers after a 
barrage of criticism over its handling of the economy 
but obervers ranging from solidarity leader lech walesa to the 
official party weekly polityka said the appointment of a new 
government has limited significance because the issue is not new 
faces but fundamental changes in the system of governing 
diplomats and party sources suggested yet another government 
might be formed in a few months anyway depending on results of 
midoctober roundtable talks the government agreed to after a wave 
of strikes in that case whoever is named prime minister this week 
might be just a temporary caretaker 
if the central committee agrees on a candidate that person 
would be named prime minister at the meeting scheduled tuesday of 
the sejm or parliament 
polish united workers party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski made 
his own recommendation saturday the official pap news agency said 
but there was no public announcement of his choice 
possible premier candidates mentioned include politburo member 
and economist wladyslaw baka politburo member and propaganda chief 
mieczyslaw rakowski interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak 
communistallied peasant party leader roman malinowski and 
alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek 
whoever assumes the job will have a daunting task inflation in 
poland is running at 60 percent annually consumer goods are in 
short supply and workers are restive after staging two punishing 
waves of strikes 
the last series of strikes ended after authorities set aside 
their longstanding opposition to negotiating with solidarity 
agreeing to the roundtable talks to consider legalizing the banned 
trade union 
political journalist daniel passent of polityka said he expected 
whoever is chosen prime minister to continue the current 
predominant tendency in governing policies but perhaps to 
bring more members of the communistallied peasant and democratic 
parties into the government 
but he said he considered it a correct decision to change the 
government in the aftermath of the last wave of strikes between 
aug 16 and sept 3 that affected at least 20 enterprises 
not to have shaken up the government would have made it seem 
like business as usual he said 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
whatever government is chosen is likely to be rather temporary 
messners team was ousted because they needed a scapegoat 
for the strikes and the poor economy said the diplomat 
but it was expected that the roundtable talks could lead to a 
more broadly based government that could include representatives of 
church or even opposition groups the diplomat said

tens of thousands of slavs rallied 
in three cities sunday to protest alleged persecution of slavs by 
ethnic albanians in a southern province the state news agency 
tanjug reported 
tanjug reported 80000 people gathered in novi sad capital of 
vojvodina province 40 miles north of belgrade the nations 
capital 
tanjug also said about 30000 rallied in andrijevica a town in 
montenegro province near the border with kosovo the troubled 
southern province 
the figures could not be independently confirmed tanjugs total 
of 300000 participants in a similar rally in the montenegran town 
of niksic saturday appeared grossly inflated since reporters 
watching the demonstrations said protesters numbered no more than 
150000 
the agency later said another rally involving 15000 took place 
in the town of prizren in kosovo which borders albania 
the rallies are designed to generate support for hardline 
serbian leader slobodan milosevic in his campaign to tighten 
control over kosovo and vojvodina two autonomous provinces 
the mostly christian slavs live in the yugoslavian republics of 
serbia and montenegro serbia administers kosovo where the mostly 
moslem albanians make up 90 percent of the population and want a 
greater political voice 
in andrijevica vlajko cukic from kosovo said the rallies were 
aimed at searching for of solutions to prevent the use of weapons 
and avoid fratricidal bloodshed we consider honest albanians 
to be our brothers 
however at virtually all rallies crowds have been clamoring for 
strongarm solutions and calling for weapons to go to kosovo 
albanians in kosovo contend the only reason about 30000 serbs 
have emigrated from kosovo since 1982 is poverty noting that 
14000 albanians have done the same 
vojvodina premier jon srbovan denounced the promilosevic 
rallies as diverting attention from the basic issues of 
fundamental importance for this country

host on saturday to express regrets 
harris told dukakis he should skip health issues during the 
debate and concentrate on other questions said barbara morgan 
harris press secretary 
harris who said last week he was afraid some would interpret 
dukakis health care initiative as a plan for national health 
insurance told the candidate the topic appeals to rankandfile 
democrats but not the undecided voters whose help will be needed to 
put democrats in the white house ms morgan said 
other items on tap for the governors include a discussion on 
martins plan to seek a resolution calling for increased oversight 
and enforcement of ocean disposal laws 
the proposal circulated in advance calls on the southern 
states energy board to undertake a review of national and

owners of a subsidized housing complex 
plan to drop their contract with the federal government a move 
that would force the elderly and disadvantaged tenants to either 
move or pay huge rent increases 
tenants in 132 units at the chateau village apartment complex 
in du page county west of chicago were notified last week that the 
owners plan to drop the contract with the us department of 
housing and urban development if a renewal agreement cant be 
reached by jan 31 
most of the tenants in chateau village receive federal rent 
subsidies under which residents pay 30 percent of their income in 
rent and hud makes up the difference 
the owners say hud refuses to pay fair market prices for the 
apartments and some tenants feel abandoned by the government 
the owners want to keep us here but hud wants to get rid of 
us said larry saladino a tenant who lives on a monthly 
disability check they want to wash their hands of the elderly 
and the children here 
housing authorities said that as demand for housing in 
fastgrowing areas like du page county forces rents up hud offices 
nationwide will have trouble keeping up with rent increases 
this is a substantial problem nationally especially in areas 
that are booming said catherine m bishop staff attorney for 
the national housing law project in berkeley calif 
hud spokesman adolph slaughter blames the nationwide housing 
crunch on greedy developers who are seeking loopholes to get 
out of providing housing for the poor 
without the subsidies many of the poor elderly and disabled 
residents will be left looking for other subsidized housing or else 
be forced to pay hefty rent increases 
i dont know where i will go said beatrice herzog 75 who 
has cancer and lives on a 358amonth social security check i 
have friends here this is my home 
we would be happy to renew our contract if hud would come 
close to what fairmarket rents are said edward schulz vice 
president of aampr katz management agents for the complex we have 
not received a rent increase in the last three years 
hud allows chateau owners to charge 400 in monthly rent for a 
onebedroom apartment the owners are seeking to raise the monthly 
amount to 465 for 1989 
the federal agency has said it will not budge from 400 even 
though its figures show 1987 fairmarket rent in du page county to 
be 477 for a onebedroom apartment and 496amonth for 1989 
huds slaughter said that if the contract were canceled the 
residents would recieve vouchers for other subsidized housing in 
the area 
but critics contend subsidized housing in du page county is 
difficult to find and that hud has only set aside 5000 vouchers 
for the county

pope john paul ii on sunday beatified a 
spanish priest revered as the founder of californias missions but 
reviled by some who say he whipped and enslaved the indians he 
worked to convert 
the rev junipero serra moved a step toward sainthood when he 
was made a blessed of the roman catholic church along with five 
other people including a mexican priest executed by a firing squad 
john paul beatified the six in an openair mass in st peters 
square before a golden altar flanked by flowers and swiss guards in 
gold blue and red uniforms 
speaking in english the pope called serra an 18th century 
franciscan monk a shining example of christian virtue and the 
missionary spirit 
his great goal was to bring the gospel to the native peoples 
of america so that they too might be consecrated in the truth 
john paul told a crowd of 20000 people 
he sowed the seeds of christian faith amid the momentous 
changes wrought by the arrival of european settlers in the new 
world it was a field of missionary endeavor that required 
patience perserverance and humility as well as vision and 
courage the pontiff said 
serra founded the first nine missions in what is now california 
and his order eventually established 21 during his us visit a 
year ago john paul stood before serras grave at the carmel 
mission basilica and praised the monk for his missionary work among 
the indians 
critics say serra stole the indians lands refused to allow 
them to leave the missions forced them to work in the fields or on 
construction projects and exposed them to european diseases to 
which they had no resistance 
a group of nine historians asked by bishop thaddeus shubsda of 
monterey calif to give their opinions on serra said in a report 
last year that there was no evidence to support the charges against 
him 
they concluded serra was being blamed for a few incidences of 
abuse most of which occurred years after his death in 1784 
rev miguel agustin pro a jesuit priest executed by mexican 
police in 1927 was the only martyr to be beatified sunday he died 
at the height of the conflict between the roman catholic church and 
the anticlerical party that started the mexican revolution and 
still governs the country 
pro was accused of taking part in an attempt to kill mexican 
ruler gen alvaro obregon he was arrested and executed without a 
trial 
in mexico on sunday church bells rang in chihuahua to 
commemorate the beatification and mexicans packed mexico citys 
basilica of guadalupe the countrys most sacred shrine for a 
special mass 
late saturday about 3000 catholics met at a building in mexico 
city where pro was executed then marched to the church where he is 
buried 
among those at the gathering was dolores pro a niece of the 
priest 
i dont forget the reasons they killed my uncle she said 
i want a free mexico democratic with an effective vote 
john paul praised pro for organizing secret communion services 
during the years of presecution but some believe pro also was 
a political activist who disguised himself as a laborer and mingled 
with the working classes 
photographs show pro kneeling in prayer then standing before a 
government firing squad with his arms open and holding a rosary and 
a crucifix before collapsing and receiving a final shot from a 
police officer 
just before he died pro shouted christ the king lives 
the mexican government has made no official comment about the 
beatification but a leftist magazine proceso called it a slap 
in the face of the revolution 
others beatified sunday were the cardinal giuseppe benedetto 
dusmet a 19th century archbishop of the sicilian city of catania 
who devoted his life to the poor and the rev francesco faa di 
bruno a 19th century italian priest who founded an order of nuns 
the pope also beatified the rev frederic janssoone bollengier 
a french missionary in the holy land and canada who died in 1916 
and josefa naval girbes a 19th century spanish woman who opened 
catechism schools for young people and adults

a return of gusty winds 
brought renewed activity on some fires in yellowstone national 
park but officials remained confident sunday they could keep them 
in check 
helicopters continued to dump water from 700gallon buckets onto 
areas where fire crews worked to douse hot spots as temperatures 
reached into the 60s and winds gusted to 25 mph 
officials estimate the fires thus far have burned as much as 60 
percent of an area covering 16 million acres of yellowstone and 
the surrounding national forests 
forecasts both for yellowstone and the shoshone national forest 
north of yellowstone where the clovermist fire is burning called 
for continued gusty winds and higher temperatures on monday 
yellowstone spokeswoman marsha karle said the weather could 
possibly pose problems for firefighters but added she didnt 
believe firefighters were as concerned as they were over the summer 
i think its just one of those things where well have to wait 
and see she said 
officials still plan to release this week the approximately 
4100 army soldiers and marines brought in to bolster civilian 
firefighters she said 
and yellowstone superintendent bob barbee said some backcountry 
areas have been reopened for overnight camping and day use 
in the shoshone national forest about 1000 firefighters faced 
50 mph winds while trying to battle the 412550acre clovermist 
fire

a measure to move up the date of local 
elections was spurned by voters monday but premier turgut ozal 
vowed to remain in office despite an earlier threat that a losing 
vote might lead to his resignation 
state television reported early monday that with 86 percent of 
the votes counted 65 percent of the electorate voted against and 
35 percent in favor of the constitutional amendment during sundays 
national referendum 
ozal whose government is battling an annual inflation rate of 
78 percent threatened last week to quit if voters overwhelmingly 
reject the amendment 
but he said in a televised address that the result was 
satisfactory because the yes vote was about the same as the 36 
percent garnered by his motherland party last year 
the percentage the largest of any party in the elections gave 
the party control of parliament 
the people chose economic development and stability 
unchanging their appreciation of us under the most difficult 
conditions ozal said of the unofficial returns 
the referendum was on a constitutional amendment adopted last 
month with the support of the motherland party it would empower 
parliament to move up the date of municipal elections from march 
1989 to nov 23 
some say ozal wants to hold local elections soon so the 
opposition social democrats wont have time to reorganize under new 
leadership 
an immediate change of government is unlikely because the 
motherland party holds 290 seats in the 450member parliament 
but ozal 61 may find it difficult to rule until 1992 when his 
fiveyear mandate expires if the vote shows his nationwide support 
is significantly eroded observers say 
opposition leaders erdal inonu of the social democrat populist 
party and former premier suleyman demirel who heads the centrist 
true path party portrayed the result as a defeat for the 
61yearold premier 
he has not received the support he was seeking said inonu 
this government has been rejected by the people said 
demirel 
meanwhile two soldiers were slain sunday in the eastern 
province of bingol when suspected kurdish guerrillas opened fire on 
a vehicle carrying polling officials anatolia reported sunday 
six people were hurt in a clash with rocks and stones in the 
eastern province of malatya after two election officials accused 
each other of cheating the agency said five were injured during a 
fistfight in the black sea coastal province of trabzon that began 
with a political argument 
ozal has cited turkeys economic growth an average 75 percent 
for the past two years inflation is a byproduct of the high 
spending which fueled the growth 
the boom has brought electricity roads telephones and 
affordable housing to most corners of the country including the 
backward southeast acceptance of 60000 kurdish refugees from iraq 
is believed to have strengthened ozals standing in the region 
populated by turkeys own kurdish minority

the first question by agreement between the two candidates 
goes to vice president bush 
it is a domestic question 
you have two minutes for an answer sir the polls say the no 1 
domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs 
what is there about these times that drives or draws so many 
americans to use drugs 
bush i think weve seen a deterioration of values 
i think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we 
should have condemned for a while as i recall it even seems to 
me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana 
and other drugs and i think thats all wrong 
so weve seen a deterioration in values and one of the things 
that i think we should do about it in terms of cause is to 
instill values into the young people in our schools we got away 
we got into this feeling that valuefree education was the thing 
and i dont believe that at all i do believe there are 
fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use

the thirdranking prelate in the church of england 
said sunday he will refuse to recognize the rev barbara c harris 
the first woman bishop in the anglican church 
the bishop of london the rt rev graham leonard said electing 
a woman bishop was secular in origin and thought and will cause 
deep divisions in the church 
in common with many other bishops i would be unable to 
recognize a woman bishop or the validity of any ordinations or 
confirmations performed by her said a statement by leonard the 
leading opponent of women priests and bishops in britain 
harris 58 on saturday was elected suffragan or assistant 
bishop for the eastern massachusetts diocese the largest in the 
episcopal church in the united states in terms of both geography 
and population 
opponents say bishops are regarded as the successors of the 
original 12 apostles of jesus christ who were men 
bishops from the worlds 27 anglican churches approved a 
carefully worded compromise resolution in canterbury england this 
summer saying they would respect and remain in fellowship with 
churches that have women priests and bishops even if they disagree 
with their principles 
the vote at the lambeth conference held once every 10 years 
was 42328 
the conference also ordered archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie spiritual leader of the church of england and 70 million 
anglicans worldwide to establish a commission to ward off any 
split in the church over the consecration of women bishops the 
commission is to meet for the first time in november 
runcie said harris election would have farreaching 
consequences for the character of the church and its relations with 
other churches 
i know however there will be some in the church of england 
and the anglican communion who feel they will not be able to 
recognize a woman as a bishop or those ordained by her runcie 
said 
about 1200 women priests have been ordained by american 
episcopalians and anglicans in canada and new zealand

harvard law school has adopted 
guidelines designed to ensure free speech after an incident last 
year when a protester prevented former contra leader adolfo calero 
from speaking 
under the rules speakers must respond to questions from the 
audience and abide by the decisions of a moderator disruptive 
demonstrators can be ejected 
the guidelines were created by a committee formed by law school 
officials after tufts university student joshua laub jumped onto a 
podium and yelled epithets at calero when the nicaraguan rebel 
leader was speaking at harvard last october 
after laub was arrested the speech was canceled and harvards 
ability to serve as a forum for free speech came under question 
it seems to have achieved what a year ago would have been 
perceived to be difficult said richard parker a law professor 
and member of the committee protest is allowed but within 
limits 
committee members say the guidelines attempt to find a middle 
ground between allowing speakers to present their message and 
permitting protesters the right to dissent 
law professor and committee member alan dershowitz said the 
ninemember committee composed of administrators faculty and 
students strived to be sensitive to giving audience members free 
speech 
a good way to handle questions about how much protest is 
acceptable is to force the speaker to confront the criticism 
parker said of the stipulation requiring speakers to face questions 
committee members said the moderator has the power to suspend 
move or cancel speeches the guidelines also say people introducing 
speakers should not be from the group sponsoring the event

lehrer governor a followup question you have two minutes to 
answer it are you suggesting sir that president reagan is one of 
the causes of the drug problem in this country 
dukakis im saying that those of us who are elected to 
positions of political leadership jim have a special 
responsibility not only to come up with programs and i have 
outlined in detail a very important very strong program of 
enforcement as well as drug education and prevention and mr bush 
is right the two go handinhand 
but if our government itself is doing business with people who 
we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking if 
we dont understand that that sends out a very very bad message to 
our young people its a little difficult for me to understand just 
how we can reach out to that youngster that i talked about and to 
young people like her all over the country and say to them we 
want to help you 
now ive outlined in great detail a program for being tough on 
enforcement at home and abroad doubling the number of drug 
enforcement agents having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th 
of january when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies 
together here in this hemisphere and go to work together 
but we also have to take demand seriously 
you know we have 5 percent of the worlds population in this 
country were consuming 50 percent of the worlds cocaine

the rev barbara c harris elected the 
first woman bishop in the anglican communions 450year history 
said sunday her elevation is the latest step in a movement to bring 
the church into the mainstream 
ms harris 58 a former public relations executive was elected 
saturday to the position of suffragan or assistant bishop for the 
eastern massachusetts diocese of the episcopal church the diocese 
which includes boston is the nations largest in both geography 
and population 
a fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours she said 
in her first sermon at philadelphias church of the advocate since 
her election 
several elections earlier this year show the church is changing 
said ms harris who is black two black priests were elected 
coadjutor bishops who are first in line to succeed their presiding 
bishops without first serving as assistants 
one of them the rev herbert thompson jr was installed in 
cincinnati on saturday as the first black bishop of the episcopal 
diocese of southern ohio 
ms harris told a congregation of 50 people that her election 
is of significance to the episcopal church in the united states 
and to the worldwide anglican communion 
the episcopal church is one of 27 selfgoverning church bodies 
in 164 countries around the world that make up the anglican 
communion about 70 million people belong with 25 million in the 
united states 
the thirdranking prelate in the church of england said sunday 
he will refuse to recognize ms harris or any other woman bishop 
i have already stated publicly that i would not be able to 
be in communion with a woman so elected and consecrated said the 
rt rev graham leonard bishop of london 
bishops at a world anglican conference this summer approved a 
resolution saying they would respect and remain in fellowship with 
churches that have women priests and bishops even if they disagree 
with their principles 
the conference also ordered archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie to establish a commission to ward off any split in the 
church over the issue the commission is scheduled to meet for the 
first time in november 
ms harris likened the churchs actions to the rev jesse 
jacksons campaigns for the democratic presidential nomination in 
1984 and 1988 
like jacksons rainbow coalition an attempt to reach across 
color and sex lines the churchs movement gives new hope and 
new vision to hundreds of thousands who have felt alienated and 
ignored by the church ms harris said 
the church is attempting to include everyone in the mainstream 
of gods justice grace brotherhood and sisterhood she said 
in her sermon 
after services ms harris read a statement saying she was 
deeply honored to accept the position she said she could not 
answer questions until a news conference tuesday in boston 
the rev paul washington retired from the church of the 
advocate said ms harris election will allow other qualified 
women to move into bishop positions 
he said black people will be more willing to listen to her views 
because we are a people who have a certain amount of respect for 
persons in authority and now they will attach her views to a 
voice of authority 
ms harris grew up in the germantown section of philadelphia a 
childhood friend millicent hartsfield attended the sermon she 
said ms harris had a strong commitment to the church even as a 
young person 
but she was also funloving ms hartsfield said she 
still is she hasnt changed much 
ms harris was a parishioner at the church of the advocate in 
1974 when the first 11 female episcopal priests were ordained there 
against church rules at the time 
ms harris a divorcee was ordained a priest in 1980 four 
years after the church changed its policy previously she was a 
public relations executive 
she was pastor in norristown from 1980 to 1984 then became the 
executive director of the episcopal publishing co

the communist partys central committee this week 
will tackle a drastic slowdown in chinas previously headlong dash 
toward free markets and modernization 
the meeting of the 175member committee which formally sets 
party policy could turn out to be more important than the 13th 
party congress of october 1987 at which new party chief zhao 
ziyang optimistically promised we shall catch up with the 
developed capitalist countries 
since then zhaos rapid moves to free prices and markets from 
central control have produced the highest inflation in two decades 
at more than 20 percent and an atmosphere of wheelingdealing and 
corruption that has horrified many party leaders 
people panicked by the rising prices joined in runs on banks in 
major cities in august then went on a collective spending spree 
not seen since before the communist takeover in 1949 
a party work meeting held last week to prepare for the central 
committee session that begins monday announced that improving the 
economic environment a code for reducing inflation would be the 
main task for the next two years rather than the wage and price 
reform that many experts believe is essential for chinas 
transformation from a centrally planned economy 
the party newspaper the peoples daily said sunday that the 
central committee would discuss a work report by zhao but it gave 
no clue as to the contents 
however recent statements by top officials indicate that in 
addition to putting price reform on hold for two years the report 
will call for clamping down on the fastgrowing money supply and 
slowing economic growth from the current overheated 11 percent to 7 
to 8 percent 
only four months ago official newspapers were energetically 
defending mandated food price hikes intended to reduce huge 
government subsidies and hinting that the national staple rice 
would be the next reform target 
but vice premier yao yilin told visiting soviet price reformers 
friday that china is not prepared to release controls on the prices 
of grain and other staples 
similarly the peoples daily announced this month that steel 
and other key raw materials will remain under central control 
indefinitely despite earlier talk of creating free markets for them 
some foreign reports attribute the new caution to premier li 
peng a methodical technocrat and fear he may have eclipsed the 
more daring zhao but the concensus among western diplomats is that 
while the uncontrolled inflation may cost zhao prestige there is 
no indication he is in serious political trouble 
chinese leaders insist they still plan to scrap the central 
planning subsidized prices and egalitarian wage system that 
stagnated the economy for decades but faced with growing public 
dissatisfaction they now put the emphasis on restoring economic 
order 
complaints about high prices are a conversation staple but 
there are other signs of public disaffection resentment of the 
new relatively wealthy class of free traders is common as is fear 
of the new competition 
the problem is that many people cant stand to see others 
doing better said a stylishly dressed young working woman 
like the leadership ordinary people fear pushing forward with 
reform but dont want to retreat either 
all anyone wants now is to make money thats all young 
people talk about said a store clerk in his teens the reforms 
of the past decade have brought most chinese unprecedented 
prosperity and no one wants to give that up

and in my state im proud to say weve organized a drug 
education prevention program which the federal drug enforcement 
administration says is a model for the country 
were helping youngsters 
were reaching out to them 
and were beginning with drug education and prevention beginning 
in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our 
state and thats the kind of effort we need in every elementary 
school in the united states of america 
and weve got to begin early in the first second and third 
grade before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very 
very dangerous substances 
i guess the question i would ask of mr bush is how we instill 
those values how we create this environment for the drug free 
schools that we want in this country if he or representatives of 
the administration are either dealing with and involving people 
like noriega in our foreign policy or dont pursue that connection 
in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an 
example to our kids all over this country 
lehrer a minute to rebut mr vice president 
bush the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the cia 
i asked for and received the same briefing 
i am very careful in public life about dealing with classified 
information and what im about to say is unclassified 
seven administrations were dealing with mr noriega 
it was the reaganbush administration that brought this man to 
justice 
and as the governor of massachusetts knows there was no 
evidence that governor that mr noriega was involved in drugs no 
hard evidence until we indicted him 
and so i think its about time we get this noriega matter in 
perspective 
panama is a friendly country 
i went down there and talked to the president of panama about 
cleaning up their money laundering and mr noriega was there but 
there was no evidence at that time 
and when the evidence was there we indicted him and we want to 
bring him to justice and so call off all those pickets out there 
that are trying to tear down seven different administrations

train and a bus and a rape near a station within two weeks 
with all the priorities this city has this has got to be one 
of them said robert e paaswell executive director of the 
transit authority im fed up to the point where im going to go 
to bat for more police officers 
the force is made up of 222 officers 
on sept 12 attorney bruce w plattenberger was shot to death 
on a rapid transit train during a robbery that remains unsolved 
two 16yearolds have been charged in the slaying of anthony 
bruno 17 six days later on a bus police believe he was killed 
because his assailants thought he belonged to a rival gang

a downtown elevated train station 
chicagos mass transit police unit is responsible for 142 rapid 
transit stations 215 miles of track and 2247 buses which carry

lehrer all right the next question will be asked by john 
mashek it goes to governor dukakis and you will have two minutes 
to answer 
mashek governor dukakis another troublesome issue for voters 
this year is the bulging federal deficit in a dukakis 
administration you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort 
would you identify for us then please three specific programs 
that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down 
dukakis yes ive been very specific about those john and let 
me lay out for you my own strategy for bringing that deficit down 
because as the chief executive thats balanced 10 budgets in a row 
ive had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices 
first i have suggested that there are certain weapons systems 
which we dont need and we cant afford 
mr bush has been critical of me for that but i think those are 
the kinds of tough choices you have to make 
ive also suggested that there are weapons systems that we 
should proceed on and ive outlined those in detail 
secondly weve got to invest in economic growth in this 
country in every part of this country building that kind of 
growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit 
thirdly we have to bring interest rates down and we will as we 
come up with a good solid plan with the congress for bringing that 
deficit down 
and finally weve got to go out there and collect billions and 
billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid in this 
country its very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his 
taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go 
uncollected 
ive also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas 
where we can make some cuts 
we ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in 
this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent 
future without spending 20 billion to 25 billion a year which 
is what weve been doing under this administration 
we can help people to live better lives and at the same time 
save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare 
to get off of welfare and to become productive citizens again

a music historian has learned something jazz 
trumpeter louis armstrong never knew about himself his birthday 
new orleans has long celebrated july 4 as satchmos birthday as 
well as that of the united states 
but tad jones says he has proof that the jazzman not only wasnt 
born on independence day 1900 but was more than a year younger 
than he thought 
jones has a certificate from sacred heart of jesus church 
showing that louis armstrong was baptized there on aug 25 1901 
three weeks after his birth on aug 4 
music scholars have long suspected that armstrongs claim of a 
july 4 1900 birth was simply a convenient fiction for the worlds 
bestknown jazz musician and one of americas bestknown citizens 
many poor illeducated blacks born around the turn of the 
century didnt know their birthdays scholars figured that 
armstrong whose birthday apparently never was celebrated when he 
was a child simply borrowed the nations birthday for his own 
officials at sacred heart of jesus were aware of the baptismal 
record for louis armstrong but assumed it could not be the same 
person because the date was so far from the generally accepted one 
jones said but the parents names on the baptismal entry matched 
and also fit with a 1910 census record and an earlier biographical 
reference saying the child was christened at sacred heart jones 
said

president manuel solis palma left for 
new york sunday and said his appearance before the un general 
assembly will give him the recognition denied him by the us 
government 
the major accomplishment of my trip to the united nations is 
not in my speech it is in the sole fact of my being there and 
being recognized by all the countries of the world as the 
constitutional president of panama he said 
the 71yearold solis palma then boarded an ecuadorian airlines 
flight at torrijos international airport 25 miles east of panama 
city 
it was his first trip abroad since feb 26 when members of the 
legislative assembly controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle and named solis palma interim 
president 
noriega chief of the nations 15000member defense forces is 
considered the real power behind the government 
the us government continues to recognize delvalle as the 
countrys legitimate leader noriega has been indicted on drug 
trafficking charges by two federal grand juries in florida 
before his ouster delvalle tried to have noriega removed as 
head of the defense forces 
solis palma and the 38 members of his delegation were granted 
limited visas to attend the meeting a us state department 
official said last week 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
visas limit the panamanians movements to new york city to use of 
the shortest direct routes connecting airports hotels and un 
headquarters 
noriega is not a member of the delegation but foreign minister 
jorge ritter said friday that noriega had planned to go to the un 
meeting the state department official said he was unaware of any 
visa application by noriega and said it would be surprising if he 
had applied

winstonsalem nc ap vice president george bush may have 
waved the flag at presidential rival michael dukakis once too 
often before a national audience sunday night bush raised the 
pledge of allegiance issue and dukakis took it away from him 
i hope that people dont think that i am questioning his 
patriotism said the republican presidential nominee after 
bringing up dukakis membership in the american civil liberties 
union and his veto of legislation that would have required teachers 
to lead massachusetts public school students in the recitation of 
the pledge of allegiance 
of course the vice president is questioning my patriotism 
said the democratic nominee i dont think theres any question 
about that and i resent it i resent it 
my parents came to this country as immigrants they taught me 
this was the greatest country in the world im in public service 
because i love this country i believe in it and nobodys going to 
question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly 
it was a particularly passionate statement from a politician who 
was asked just moments earlier about his perceived lack of passion 
his image as the smartest clerk in the world 
the pledge of allegiance issue has become a central theme of 
bushs attacks on dukakis the massachusetts governor while 
affirming his support of the pledge of allegiance said he vetoed 
the bill because a state supreme court advisory opinion said it was 
unconstitutional 
late in the debate bush delivered one of his strongest 
statements as he responded to a question about his selection of 
sen dan quayle of indiana to be his vice president 
im putting my confidence in a whole generation of people who 
are in their 30s and in their 40s responded bush 
judge the man on his record not on a lot of rumors and 
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name bush continued 
dukakis usually refers to quayle scornfully as j danforth 
quayle 
do you know who j danforth was asked bush looking at 
dukakis he was a man who gave his life in world war ii so 
ridiculing a persons name is a little beneath this process 
from the start of their 90minute debate an event widely 
regarded as pivotal in a presidential campaign with no clear front 
runner and an electorate with no strong feelings about either 
candidate dukakis was on the attack 
the first question was about drugs and the democratic nominee 
swiftly tossed out one of his most familiar lines his accusation 
that the reagan administration has been dealing with a 
drugrunning panamanian dictator 
bush was ready 
seven administrations were dealing with mr noriega he 
said it was the reaganbush administration that brought this man 
to justice 
the first volley of oneliners came on a question about the 
federal budget deficit 
dukakis said he couldnt understand how bush could balance the 
budget and also increase defense spending cut capital gains taxes 
and refuse to consider any other tax increases 
if he keeps this up hes going to be the joe isuzu of american 
politics said dukakis in a reference to isuzu commercials in 
which the salesman makes wildly implausible claims for the car 
that answer was about as clear as boston harbor retorted 
bush who has scored points in this campaign with an attack on 
pollution in dukakis front yard 
if dukakis was the first to go on the attack bush was not far 
behind 
the vice president touched on all the issues that he has raised 
during the past six weeks a period that has seen a dramatic shift 
in the polls as dukakis big lead evaporated 
but dukakis was wellprepared for many of those attacks 
on the abortion issue bush said he had not worked out the 
penalties he would like to impose on a woman who had the procedure 
hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this 
choice responded dukakis who declared his own opposition to 
abortion but said a woman had the right to choose whether to have 
one

winstonsalem nc ap george bush and michael dukakis 
greeted one another congenially sunday at the start of their first 
presidential debate but dropped any pretense of cordiality with 
the first round of questions 
the two candidates strode energetically to center stage for the 
headtohead encounter shook hands amiably and then got down to 
business 
dukakis got the first laugh of the encounter when he questioned 
bushs tax and spending policies 
if bush keeps it up dukakis said hes going to be the 
joe isuzu of american politics referring to the comical 
lessthanforthright car company spokesman featured in tv 
advertisements 
bushs quick comeback is the time we unleash our 
oneliners 
he paused then drew a big round of laugher and applause when he 
said of dukakis statements that answer was about as clear as 
boston harbor a reference to the polluted body of water in 
dukakis home state 
both campaigns were keenly aware that the messages bush and 
dukakis hoped to deliver to millions of television viewers could be 
bolstered or undermined by their personal appearance and 
mannerisms 
dukakis stood virtually motionless except for gesturing with his 
hands as he spoke and sipping water occasionally between questions 
bush shifted around a little more and fidgeted with his hands 
between questions sometimes taking notes with a pen while his 
opponent spoke 
bush at times became heated as the debate wore on particularly 
when defending his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana he 
mopped his brow with a handkerchief after making his closing 
statement 
at the debates conclusion the two men shook hands then bush 
approached the questioners table and shook hands with the 
panelists dukakis walked over to embrace his wife kitty who came 
on stage bush also kissed his wife barbara when she came on 
stage 
in a campaign as close as this one little things assume a lot 
of importance 
thus bush and dukakis took time for predebate walkthroughs to 
familiarize themselves with the debate site at wake forest 
universitys wait chapel where a redcarpeted stage and blue 
backdrop were built over the chapel altar 
aides brought several sets of shirts and neckties to determine 
which looked better on dukakis under the tv lights said media 
consultant frank greer he opted for a white shirt and red tie to 
go with the bluishgray suit he had selected 
bush wore a dark blue suit 
appearance is very important said greer who has advised 
candidates on presidential debates since 1976 including the last 
one between president reagan and democratic challenger walter 
mondale in 1984 
greer said dukakis was wearing light makeup mostly to minimize 
shadows under his eyes but that very little makeup was needed for 
either candidate because the lighting had been carefully arranged 
to make both of them look good 
bushs podium was 48 inches high while dukakis who stands 
nearly a halffoot shorter than the vice president had a 45inch 
lectern and got a few inches of lift from a riser inserted subtly 
beneath the carpeting behind his podium 
the candidates hoped to demonstrate both knowledge and 
likability 
bush told reporters earlier that he wanted to master details but 
also to project his feelings so people could see me for what i 
think i am 
greer said he had coached dukakis on projecting a warmer image 
and had advised him to go heavy on style the massachusetts 
governor is perceived by his aides as having a curt technocratic 
style 
what everyone forgets is you win debates on style not 
substance greer said 
people dont want you to be an encyclopedia he said its 
much more creating warmth and feeling youre playing to people 
sitting in their living rooms 
greer recalled that reagan was briefed in so much detail for his 
first debate with mondale four years ago that he gave a somewhat 
rambling stumbling performance 
the debate set in wait chapel was designed to produce an 
intimate atmosphere the table for media questioners was positioned 
about eight feet in front of the debaters lecterns 
to help boost the candidates each campaign flew in a supporting 
cast of politicians to give glowing postdebate critiques of how 
bush and dukakis performed 
for dukakis they included gov bill clinton of arkansas and 
sens bill bradley of new jersey edward kennedy of massachusetts 
alan cranston of california john glenn of ohio carl levin of 
michigan and barbara mikulski of maryland 
bushs boosters included pollster robert teeter senior campaign 
officials lee atwater and craig fuller govs john sununu of new 
hampshire and jim martin of north carolina sen alan simpson of 
wyoming former delaware gov pete du pont and former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole

the thing i dont understand about mr bushs approach to this 
is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit 
down given what he says he wants to do 
he seems to want to want to spend a great deal of money on just 
about every weapon system he says hes against new taxes although 
hes broken that pledge at least three times in the last year that 
i know of 
he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a 
fiveyear 40 billion tax break and he also wants to spend a lot 
of money on additional programs 
if he keeps this up hes going to be the joe isuzu of american 
politics 
laughter 
but i hope you wont take my five seconds away from me but i 
will say this 
lehrer your two minutes is up governor 
dukakis if hes serious about what hes saying then the only 
place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the social 
security trust fund and he tried that in 1985 and i think hes 
going to try that again 
lehrer you have a minute to rebut 
bush is this the time to unleash our oneliners 
that answer was about as clear as boston harbor laughter 
let me help the governor 
theres so many things there i dont quite know where to begin 
when you cut capital gains you put people to work john kennedy 
proposed cutting capital gains paul tsongas a liberal senator 
from massachusetts said the dumbest thing i did was to oppose 
the capital gains cut 
its not going to cost the government money its going to 
increase revenues to the federal government and its going to 
create jobs 
so thats one of the things that i think makes a big difference 
between us 
now massachusetts doesnt have an enormous defense budget but 
nevertheless the governor raised taxes five different times 
that happens to be a fact 
and so lets kind of stay on the issue and i have made a 
specific proposal for what i call a flexible freeze and it permits 
economists on the east coast and west think its good it 
permits the president to sort out the priorities and we continue to 
grow because i will not raise taxes

including allowing more competition in some sectors of the 
argentine economy 
let me be blunt barber b conable world bank president 
said in west berlin where world bank and international monetery 
fund talks were being held argentina faces difficult problems 
and a tough battle to escape the low growth highdebt 
highinflation trap it is in 
but i am convinced that the program the government has 
designed is a major step in the right direction conable said 
argentine economy minister juan sourrouille in a letter 
thursday outlining his program said argentine inflation was 
running 30 percent a month in august was down to a third of that 
in september and would be much less in october 
his program also promised to cut the government deficit from 46 
percent of the countrys gross national product this year to no 
more than 24 percent in 1989 
frank vogl world banks chief spokesman said 150 million 
would be disbursed in october 350 million early next year and 
200 million in the late spring after the first 150 million the 
next 550 million would be subject to agreed conditions 
if they dont make the reforms they dont get the money 
said vogl said 
conable said another 550 million will be loaned for lowcost 
housing and electric power projects loans to be disbursed more 
slowly and not subject to the same conditions 
sourrouille told a news conference sunday the loans would make 
available a 500 million bridge loan promised by the united 
states and other governments through the bank for international 
settlements 
the money would help argentina out while it is negotiating for 
12 billion more from the international monetary fund a fund 
mission has been negotiating in buenos aires and sourrouille said 
he hoped to finish the negotiations soon argentina is also 
negotiating with the commercial banks to which more than 42 
billion of its debt is owed the market is dubious about the value 
of these loans in march of this year some of them were selling 
for 28 cents on the dollar 
sourrouille said he expected to be able to pay half the annual 
interest due from argentinas own resources he did not say where 
the rest would come from 
the world bank offers aid for economic development programs to 
developing nations with enormous debt the international monetary 
fund its sister organization has spearheaded a program of 
financial aid to those countries

lehrer your time is up too a followup john 
mashek mr vice president you have vowed not to raise taxes of 
any kind during your administration and at the same time youve 
proposed this capital gains cut youve proposed more incentive 
breaks for the oil industry youve suggested new spending programs 
and even some republicans say a flexible freeze you just spoke 
about will hardly make a dent in the deficit is the deficit no 
longer really a concern of yours the republican party or the 
taxpayers 
bush i think its the republican party and my concern to bring 
it down 
and presidential leadership that i want to provide in this 
area will bring it down 
but weve got to get the democrats congress under control 
they do all the spending they appropriate every dime and tell us 
how to spend every dime 
id like to ask the governor to join me in getting for the 
president what 43 governors have the lineitem veto 
he has to operate in massachusetts under a balanced budget 
proviso i would like a balanced budget amendment 
but the dynamics of the economy we cut the taxes and revenues 
are up by 25 percent in three years 
so the problem is its not that the working man is being taxed 
too little or the person working the woman working in some 
factory being taxed too little it is that we are continuing to 
spend too much 
so my formula says grow at the rate of inflation permit the 
president to set the priorities on where we do this spending and 
remember the federal deficit has come down 70 billion in one 
year in 1987 
and if we and actually this year congress is doing a little 
better in controlling the growth of spending spending was only up 
something like 4 percent 
so it isnt that were taking too little per taxpayer were 
spending too much still 
and the formula ive given you works 
weve put it through a good economic model 
weve got good economists on the west coast michael boskin and 
marty feldstein up there whos a very respected economist in the 
massachusetts and they agree that if we can do what ive said we 
can get it down without going and socking the american taxpayer 
once again 
and capital gains one more point on that please lets learn 
from history a capital gains differential will increase jobs 
increase risk taking increase revenues to the federal government

lehrer governor you have a minute to rebut 
dukakis well i hope all of those americans out there who are 
watching us listening to us and trying to make up their minds 
about which one of us ought to be president of the united states 
listen to the vice president very carefully 
what hes proposing after over a trillion dollars in new debt 
which has been added to the federal debt in the course of the past 
eight years an iou that our children and grandchildren will be 
paying for years is a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of the 
people in this country an average of about 30000 that were 
going to give to people making 200000 a year 
why thats more than the average teacher makes weve had 
enough of that ladies and gentlemen 
weve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all of 
the presidents from george washington to jimmy carter combined 
its time for a chief executive who can make tough choices can 
work with the congress can get that deficit down and begin to 
build a strong fiscal foundation under this country 
lehrer all right the next question will be asked by anne 
groer and it will go to the vice president you have two minutes 
to answer sir 
groer mr vice president youve said you want a kinder 
gentler presidency one that helps the less fortunate today 37 
million americans including many working families with aging 
parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance 
but earn too much to qualify for medicaid what will you do to 
provide protection for them and how will you pay for it

bush one thing i will not do is sock every business in the 
country and thus throw some people out of work 
i want to keep this economic recovery going more americans at 
work today than at any time in history a greater percentage of the 
workforce 
what i will do is permit people to buy into medicaid 
i believe thats the answer 
i am proud to have been part of an administration that passed 
the first catastrophic health bill 
and in that theres some medicaid provisions that will be very 
helpful to the kind of people were talking about here 
but weve got to keep going forward without killing off the 
engine and throwing people out of work 
so the answer lies it seems to me in full enforcement of the 
catastrophic program 
it lies to me in flexibility in medicaid so people at the 
lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then 
it also i do not want to see us mandate across the board that 
every company has to do this 
because i really think that marginal operators are going to go 
say we cant make it and i think then youre going to see 
that people are put out of work 
all of these programs and the cost on his was i saw an 
estimate id love to know what he thinks 35 40 billion and 
it seems to me that somebody pays that 
there isnt any such thing as something free out there 
it either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets 
passed along by people being put out of work so the business can 
continue to compete so i think we ought to do it in the medicaid 
system 
i think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the 
catastrophic health insurance 
i think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do 
out of conscience 
its a terrible problem in terms of the in terms of 
flexibility on private insurances but i just dont want to 
mandate it and risk putting this setting recovery back 
lehrer a rebuttal governor 
dukakis but george thats no answer you know last 
bush you dont like the answer but it was an answer 
dukakis well no its no answer to those 37 million people 
most of them members of working families who dont have a dime of 
health insurance and dont know how to pay the bills if the kids 
get sick at night 
i was in houston on tuesday meeting with a group of good 
citizens working citizens all of them with little or no health 
insurance one of them was a father who had been laid off a few 
months ago and lost his health insurance 
he has a 11 year old son and cant let that son compete in 
sports in little league because hes afraid hes going to get hurt 
and he wont be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills 
my state just became the only state in the nation to provide for 
universal health care and we did it with the support of the 
business community and labor and the health care community and 
with virtually everybody in the state 
the fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring 
their employees are paying the freight because theyre paying for 
those who arent and i think its time that when you get a job in 
this country it came with health insurance 
thats the way were going to provide basic health security for 
all of the citizens in this country of ours

from the presidential debate audience sunday night after 
questioning michael dukakis use of the term phony or some one of 
these marvelous boston adjectives to describe the reagan 
administrations foreign policy 
the audience appeared to have interpreted the remark as a 
regional slur based on the view that boston and its environs are 
home to excessively liberal politicians and ideas 
several bostonians dont like it bush said in reponse to 
the sound from the audience but the rest of the country will

the national transportation safety board has 
identified problems that lead to train wrecks but the federal 
railroad administration has not done anything about it leading to 
hundreds of deaths and millions of dollars in property damage a 
newspaper reported sunday 
critics of the fra contend the agency is using economic 
deregulation of the nations railroads as an excuse to deregulate 
safety and the rail accident rate may be climbing as a result the 
pittsburgh press reported sunday 
we certainly get the impression of a cozy relationship between 
the top echelons of those who are supposed to do the regulating and 
the railroads themselves said rep thomas luken dohio 
chairman of the house transportation and hazardous materials 
subcommittee 
a ninemonth investigation by the newspaper revealed that the 
fra usually does nothing more than simply inform railroads that 
theyve broken safety laws 
fines are rarely imposed and often are bargained down to 50 
cents on the dollar accident reports usually are based on the 
railroads own findings because the fra doesnt investigate most 
accidents the newspaper said 
fra administrator john riley however said 99 percent of all 
safety violation reports result in fines he has cited declining 
accident rates in the rail industry in defending his agency against 
criticism of its enforcement the press said 
the bottom line is that the situation has gotten safer 
considerably safer riley told the newspaper 
the fra investigates about 10 percent of all the nations 
railroad accidents the agencys statistics on accidents are 
largely compiled from the railroads own accounts the newspaper 
said 
many safety experts believe that because the fra is lax in 
enforcing safety rules railroads are even more likely to ignore 
widespread problems with track signals and other mechanical 
equipment reported by their own workers the press said 
its a remnant of a bygone era when railroads regulated 
themselves luken said we have found very little enthusiasm in 
the fra for enforcement or ferreting out or correcting problems or 
doing detailed investigation he said 
railroad employees said they feel the fra sometimes is too close 
to management 
we take our problems to the fra and the first thing they want 
to know is your name said wayne geist an amtrak engineer 
they promise anonymity but the next day the railroad knows all 
about it and then the trouble really starts geist said 
some of the agencys own investigators were among its strongest 
critics an informal press survey of 31 fra investigators and 
supervisors in 13 states found a high level of frustration at the 
obstacles they face as they try to make railroads comply with the 
law 
riley blamed the discontent on his men being overworked from 
responding to major accidents 
state rail safety investigators who also work under fra 
guidance express similar frustrations with the agency however 
the newspaper said 
we are controlled by the fras rules and how it interprets 
those rules said donald rugh rail safety inspector for the ohio 
public utility commission 
they have got some really good people out in the field but 
theyre governed by the same philosophy dont cause any waves 
dont rock the boat make it look good but dont push too hard 
rugh said 
no matter how bad a defect we cant put any equipment out of 
service said dave whanger a rail safety inspector for the west 
virginia public utility commission 
we can fine the railroad if they dont fix it but its up to 
them to stop using it whanger said

ailing emperor hirohito lost more blood one week 
after falling seriously ill with internal hemorrhaging but 
officials said monday the 87yearold monarch remained in stable 
condition 
government spokesman keizo obuchi the chief cabinet secretary 
said hirohito watched his favorite sport sumo wrestling on 
television sunday but he showed no signs of fatigue today as a 
result 
nearly 800 people waited outside the palace early monday and 
signed registries wishing the monarch well 
kenji maeda general affairs head of the imperial household 
agency said that while the hirohito was in stable condition and 
fully conscious he discharged slight traces of blood from sunday 
night until monday morning 
maeda said doctors were prepared to give more blood transfusions 
monday 
obuchi said his overall condition monday is the same as 
yesterdays its stable 
the emperors temperature was 981 monday down from 986 sunday 
night but still well above his normal reading of around 959 
according to the palace 
despite upbeat reports by government and palace officials 
shares fell as the tokyo stock exchange opened monday due to 
concern over the emperors condition traders said 
on sunday thousands of wellwishers braved thunderstorms and 
cold rain to throng the gates of the moated imperial palace in 
central tokyo under a sea of bright umbrellas palace officials say 
300000 have signed their names in a dozen registries set up 
nationwide to pray for hirohitos recovery 
hirohito has sat on japans chrysanthemum throne for nearly 62 
years 
under the constitution the emperor has no political power but 
signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a 
symbol of japans unity 
the imperial household agency said hirohito viewed the final 
matches of the autumn grand sumo tournament on television a noted 
fan of the ancient wrestling sport the emperor watched grand 
champion chiyonofuji claim his 25th tournament title with a 150 
record and commented a perfect victory isnt it 
meanwhile television stations replaced comedy and variety 
programs with more sedate documentaries out of deference to the 
monarch 
a stream of imperial relatives continued to arrive to pay 
respects at his bedside crown prince akihito who assumed all his 
fathers official duties thursday arrived from his nearby palace 
with his wife princess michiko 
two of akihitos children prince hiro 28 and 19yearold 
princess nori spoke briefly with their grandfather and hirohitos 
three daughters also paid visits the palace said 
i was anxious about his health but i feel better now that i 
was able to speak with him his daughter takako shimazu told 
reporters 
the emperor was running a slight fever of 986 f in the evening 
maeda told a press conference the level although down from its 
peak saturday was still above his normal temperature of 959 
court physicians administered 85 pints in blood transfusions 
bringing the total since last monday to 553 pints 
they also injected platelets to thicken hirohitos blood which 
was thinning from the frequent transfusions and making it more 
difficult to stop the bleeding doctors said 
the emperors pulse rate was 80 and his blood pressure 140 over 
68 maeda said

lehrer follow up anne 
groer yes since your massachusetts health plan has been 
attacked by the vice president and you have defended it in this 
way id like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical 
catastrophies facing americans today and that is aids 
at the end of september the thousands of aids patients will 
lose their access to azt which is the only federally approved drug 
for treatment of the disease 
now id like to know sir if what your position is on 
extending that and what it is that do you think the government 
ought to be doing about making azt and other drugs available to 
people who are suffering from this disease 
dukakis well anne let me just say before i answer your 
question that i didnt know that the vice president had attacked 
our program in massachusetts i hope he hasnt because it has won 
the support of agreat many people all over the state and i think 
its a model for what i hope we can do across the country 
but when i proposed my plan this past tuesday he or one of his 
spokesman called it socialized medicine 
the last time the vice president used that phrase i suspect he 
remembers it dont you it was in 1964 and thats what he called 
medicare well he was wrong then and hes wrong now 
applause 
lehrer if i may 
dukakis let me also 
lehrer excuse me governor if i may interrupt at this point 
and caution the audience as i did before we went on the air 
please hold it down youre only taking time away from your 
candidate when you do that governor continue please 
dukakis let me say this about aids its the single most 
important public health crisis single most important public health 
emergency weve had in our lifetimes 
and i think there are a number of things we have to do 
including supporting legislation which is now moving through the 
congress which will commit this nation to the resources to find a 
cure which will provide broad education and prevention which will 
provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of aids 
i think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and i think the 
fda is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for 
new and experimental drugs to be available to the people who are at 
risk at aids 
and i would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to 
bear beginning in january 
and i would encourage the current administration to proceed with 
that kind of flexibility where its appropriate and where its done 
carefully and responsibly 
but we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had 
in this particular area i think the vice president and i are in 
general agreement on what we have to do 
the special federal commission made good solid recommendations 
i think were both supportive of them and i would strongly lead in 
that area as i have in my state as governor 
lehrer mr vice president a minute rebuttal 
bush well were on the right track the nih is doing a good 
job in research the surgeon general is doing a good job in 
encouraging the proper kind of education 
i noticed that the governor did not mention any testing but 
weve got to have a knowledge base testing should be confidential 
but we have to have a knowledge base we cant simply stick our 
heads in the sands in terms of testing 
im chairman of the presidents task force on regulatory relief 
and we are working with the fda and they have sped up bringing 
drugs to market that can help 
and youve got to be careful here because theres a safety 
factor but i think these things and then also i am one who 
believes weve got to go the extra mile in clean being sure that 
that blood supply is is pure 
we cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it 
comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature 
so research speeding the drugs to market testing blood 
supply are very important elements of this 
lehrer next question will be asked by peter jennings it goes 
to the governor 
jennings good evening mr vice president governor 
dukakis peter 
jennings governor one theme that theme that keeps coming up 
about the way you govern you have both mentioned leadership 
tonight so id like to stay with that for a second the theme that 
keeps coming up about the way you govern is passionless 
technocratic 
dukakis passionless 
jennings passionless technocratic the smartest clerk in the 
world your critics maintain that in the 1960s your public passion 
was not the war in vietnam or civil rights but nofault auto 
insurance 
they say that in the 1970s you played virtually no role in the 
painful busing crisis in boston given the fact that a president 
must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion we need to 
know if this is a fair portrait of your governing or is it a 
stereotype

and if it isnt fair can you give us an example of where you 
have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president 
needs 
dukakis peter i care deeply about people all people working 
people working families people all over this country who in some 
cases are living from paycheck to paycheck in other cases theyre 
having a hard time opening up the door of college opportunity to 
their children in other cases dont have basic health insurance 
which for most of us we accept as a matter of course assuming 
were going to have and were going to pay the bills we incur when 
we get sick and somebody who believes deeply in genuine 
opportunity for every single citizen in this country and thats 
the kind of passion that i brought to my state 
i was a leader in the civil rights movement in my state and in 
my legislature i cared very deeply about that war in vietnam i 
thought it was a mistake i thought it was wrong and i was one of 
the few legislators early in that war that took a stand against the 
war i think it was the right stand at the time and i think 
history has proved us to be correct 
but i have learned over time i served one term i was defeated 
as you know and defeat sometimes is an important lesson i think 
im a much better governor today i think im a much better person 
a much better listener i think ill be a much better president for 
having gone through that experience 
but the things that weve done in my state to bring opportunity 
to people on public assistance over 50000 families on welfare 
that weve helped to move from welfare to work and to become 
productive citizens the universal health care bill that weve just 
talked about which will guarantee health care for all of our 
citizens the opening up of opportunities to minorities in my 
state affirmative action minority contracting the fact that we 
have a 3 percent unemployment rate and more jobs than people to 
fill them which gives us a tremendous opportunity to reach out to 
everybody and make them a part of this wonderful nation of ours 
with the opportunity that we create 
these are things that i believe in very very deeply i may be a 
little calmer than some about it i may be a greater 
consensusbuilder these days than i used to be and i think thats a 
good thing but im running for the presidency of the united 
states ive been in public service for 25 years because i believe 
deeply in american goals and values and the people of this country 
and thats the kind of president i want to be

lehrer mr vice president a rebuttal 
bush well i dont question his passion i question and i 
dont question his concern about the war in vietnam he introduced 
or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids from 
massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war 
now thats a certain passion but in my view its misguided 
passion 
he we have a big difference on issues you see last year in 
the primary he expressed his passion 
he said i am a strong liberal democrat august 87 
then he said i am a cardcarrying member of the aclu 
that was what he said he is out there on out of the 
mainstream he is very passionate my argument with the governor 
is do we want this country to go that far left and i wish we had 
time to let me explain but i salute him for his passion we just 
have a big difference on where this country should be led and in 
what direction it ought to go 
lehrer peter a question for the vice president peter 
jennings id just like to follow up if i may on this mention 
youve made of his cardcarrying membership in the american civil 
liberties union now youve used the phrase cardcarrying so 
many times since governor dukakis first acknowledged that he was a 
cardcarrying member of the aclu that some people some people 
have come to believe that you have used it in to brand him in some 
way to identify him as people were identified in the 1950s as 
less than patriotic 
id like to know why you keep repeating the phrase whats the 
important issue here what is so wrong with the governor being a 
member of an organization which has come to the defense of among 
other people col oliver north 
bush nothings wrong with it but just take a look at the 
positions of the just take a look at the positions of the aclu 
but peter please understand the liberals do not like me 
talking about liberal 
they do not like it when i say that he says hes a cardcarrying 
member now if that quote was wrong he can repudiate it right 
here 
ive seen it authoritatively written twice and if ive done him 
an injustice and he didnt say it im very very sorry 
but i dont agree with a lot of the most of the positions of 
the aclu i simply dont want to see the ratings on movies i dont

partisans on each side declared their man the winner in sunday 
nights debate with one democratic senator saying michael dukakis 
won on the basis of moments of spontaneity but a republican 
senator saying bush successfully fended him off 
i think george bush won dukakis had to do well and i think 
this will clearly be the opportunity michael dukakis lost sen 
alfonse damato said in new york the vice president has fended 
him off 
sen bill bradley of new jersey interviewed at wake forest 
university in winstonsalem nc where the debate was held said 
the moments of spontaneity were what distinguished michael 
dukakis tonight the real winner was the american people but 
michael dukakis outperformed george bush tonight 
former presidentialprimary rivals of the two nominees also 
picked winners along party lines 
rep richard gephardt dmo said dukakis won decisively in 
terms of picking up political support he came across as assured 
confident and clear on the facts bush seemed befuddled and 
confused 
but sen bob dole the topranking republican in the senate as 
well as a former presidential candidate said george bush had a 
mission and he can say mission accomplished he documented again 
and again that mike dukakis is a ted kennedy massachusetts liberal 
and that means someone whos out of step with mainstream 
america 
pat robertson the former television evangelist defeated by bush 
last spring said on the important issues of taxation strong 
defense and law and order george bush was a clear winner 
minnesota state auditor arne carlson the highestranking 
republican in that state said neither candidate lost ground since 
nobody made a mistake nobody offended anyone 
but other elected officials were not shy about declaring their 
partys standardbearer the victor 
democratic new york gov mario cuomo said in a statement 
released by his office governor dukakis clearly advanced his 
campaign dramatically he appeared knowledgeable decisive cool 
presidential he won 
another prominent democrat ann richards the texas state 
treasurer and keynote speaker at the democratic convention last 
july claimed similarly that dukakis looked presidential she 
added i thought bush visibly lost his temper which is a nono 
in a debate 
however fellow texan phil gramm a republican senator said 
i believe that george bush came across as more personable more 
likable i thought dukakis was especially weak on foreign policy 
and defense i believe george bush did what he had to do to win 
the election he came across as being more of a leader and more of 
a real person 
another republican senator orrin hatch of utah said both 
candidates did well in the debate but in my opinion bush really 
laid him out and for the first time he really branded dukakis as 
the liberal he really is 
sen robert byrd of west virginia the democratic leader in the 
senate said tonight we saw a leader emerge and it was michael 
dukakis i think the polls will show that the american people 
thought the same way 
some nonofficeholders based their analysis on style 
both of them were obviously very well coached said 
psychologist joyce brothers dukakis use of hands was better i 
had much more of a sense of relaxation from bush and that is a 
plus i think it was a very close debate 
dukakis did much better when the camera caught him 
accidentally he is the master of the ironic smile she said 
bush was caught making notes like a professor thats a minus 
but bush is the better master of the pause dukakis licks his lips 
too much which is a minus 
lillian glass a speech consultant who is author of talk to 
win said dukakis came across a lot weaker than bush 
bush looks presidential but he needs to hold his head up 
straighter she said he made impressive recovery when he made 
an error it made a big difference for him to drop his voice the 
wimp factor is finally gone 
not all observers wanted emotion 
i think theres too much emotion and passion in politics and 
what we need is more rationality and articulateness said sen 
claiborne pell dri it was dukakis he said whose answers 
were the most articulate and indepth 
at the same time pell said i thought the whole debate was 
pretty mundane 
california assembly speaker willie brown another democrat 
agreed it was rather boring still he said dukakis 
demonstrated that he was equal if not superior to mr bush on 
defense and he was clearly superior on domestic programs 
but delaware gov michael castle chairman of the republican 
governors association said bush came off as more caring 
clearly mike dukakis was painted as being even more liberal 
than the bush campaign has been painting him so far said castle 
at the southern governors conference in sea island ga 
florida gov bob martinez another republican at the conference 
said bush held the advantage he had going into the debate he 
said dukakis had to go there and slay a dragon and clearly he 
didnt 
two democrats at the sea island conference saw it differently 
the first round was won by governor dukakis it was not a 
knockout but clearly in my judgment a sound decision said 
virginia gov gerald l baliles dukakis was more in command of 
the facts more articulate and looked presidential 
gov ned mcwherter dtenn said dukakis showed the american 
people that he can hold his footing with george bush after all 
george bush is vice president of the united states

portray their candidate in the best possible light and make the

dukakis adviser frank greer who worked with dukakis on 
projecting a more human image said his candidate did everything 
that he needed to do and a lot more he said dukakis showed a

parents 
he laughed at himself and at bush greer said he engaged 
george bush more than george bush engaged him

i like those rating systems i dont think theyre right to try 
to take the tax exemption away from the catholic church i dont 
want to see their kiddie pornographic laws repealed i dont want 
to see under god come out from our currency now these are all 
positions of the aclu and i dont agree with them 
he has every right to exercise his passion as what he said a 
strong progressive liberal i dont agree with that i come from a 
very different point of view and i think im more in touch with 
the mainstream of america they raised the same thing with me on 
the pledge of allegiance you see id have found a way to sign 
that bill governor thompson of illinois did im not questioning 
his patriotism he goes out and says the man is questioning my 
patriotism and then all the liberal columnists join in i am 
not i am questioning his judgment on these matters or where hes 
coming from he has every right to do it but i believe thats not 
what the american people want 
and when he said when he said at the convention ideology 
doesnt matter just competence he was moving away from his own 
record from what his passion has been over the years and thats 
all im trying to do is put it in focus and i hope people dont 
think that im questioning his patriotism when i say he use his 
words to describe his participation in that organization 
lehrer governor response 
dukakis well i hope this is the first and last time i have to 
say this of course the vice president is questioning my 
patriotism i dont think theres any question about that and i 
resent it i resent it 
my parents came to this country as immigrants they taught me 
that this was the greatest country in the world im in public 
service because i love this country i believe in it and nobodys 
going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now 
repeatedly the fact of the matter is that if the pledge of 
allegiance was the acid test of ones patriotism the vice 
presidents been the presiding officer in the united states senate 
for the past 7 years to the best of my knowledge hes never once 
suggested that the session of the senate begin with the pledge of 
allegiance 
mr bush i dont question your patriotism when you were 
attacked for your military record i immediately said that it was 
inappopriate it had no place in this campaign and i rejected it 
and i would hope that from this point on we get to the issues 
that affect the vast majority of americans jobs schools health 
care housing the environment 
those are the concerns of the people who are watching us 
tonight not labels that we attach to each other questions about 
each others patriotism and loyalty 
lehrer time is up governor lets go now to john mashek again 
a question for the vice president 
mashek mr vice president in a debate during the republican 
primaries you said most of the nations homeless are suffering 
from mental illness an assertion immediately challenged by one of 
your rivals estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250000 
by the government to around 3 million including working families 
and their children what commitment are you willing to make tonight 
to this voiceless segment of our society 
bush i want to see the mckinney act fully funded i believe 
that that would help in terms of shelter i want to see when i 
talked at our at our convention about a thousand points of light 
i was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and 
organizations that help the governors wife been very active in 
the homeless and my my campaign chairman secretary jim bakers 
wife 
this isnt government these are people that care that are 
trying to give of themselves the government has a role it is to 
fully fund the mckinney act there are certain army bases that the 
act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people 
when its rough 
and so i think that were on the right track i dont see this 
incidentally as a democrat or a republican or a liberal or a 
conservative idea i see an involvement by a thousand points of 
light i see the funding that is required and i hope the congress 
will fully fund this bill they gave it a great deal of conscience 
and a great deal of work and were on the right track on this one 
but and i look mental that was a little overstated it id 
say around 30 percent and i think maybe we could look back over 
our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all of those 
mental patients out maybe we need to do a better job in mental 
clinics to help help them because there is a major problem 
there a lot of them are mentally sick and weve got to attend to 
them 
but fully my my shortrange answer is fully fund that 
mckinney act 
lehrer governor a response 
dukakis well this is another fundamental difference that i 
have with the vice president just as i do in the case of health 
care for 37 million members of working families in this country who 
dont have health insurance 
the problem mr bush is that youve cut back by 90 percent on 
our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and 
moderate income and when you do that you have homeless families 
we didnt have 2 million or 3 million homeless people living on 
streets and in doorways in this country 10 years ago 
weve got to begin to get back to the business of building and 
rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in 
this country housing for young families that they can look 
forward someday to buy weve got communities in this country 
increasingly where our own kids cant afford to live in the 
communities that they grew up in thats an essential commitment 
and i think the housing community is ready but its going to take 
a president whos committed to housing whos had experience in 
building and rehabilitating housing who understands that 
affordable housing for families of low and moderate income for 
young families first time home buyers is an essential part of the 
american dream 
and while im all for the mckinney bill that by itself simply 
wont do weve got to have a president that can lead on this 
issue that can work with the congress and im prepared to do so 
this is one of the most important priorities that faces this 
country 
lehrer john a question for the governor 
mashek governor youve mentioned the american dream of home 
ownership and its certainly become an impossible one for many of 
the young people of our nation who are caught up in this 
economic squeeze of the middle class as youve said so 
frequently during the campaign 
and yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago what 
promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with 
the costs of housing going up and with the limited help available 
from washington are we destined to become a nation of renters

winstonsalem nc ap george bush said sunday night that he 
had hoped for a little friendlier an evening with michael 
dukakis but that their often cantankerous debate reinforced the 
differences between the two presidential campaigns 
at a rally afterward bush assessed his debate performance with 
repeated thumbsup signs 
it is my firm belief that we had an opportunity to speak out 
my dreams and my objectives and i am not going to let this man move 
to the center and try to get away from his past bush told 
400500 flagwaving and cow bellringing supporters 
we had a great opportunity tonight to spell out some of the 
differences bush said but that was for tonight starting 
tomorrow on to tennessee and across the south and up into the 
midwest 
the republican presidential nominee begins a fourday tour 
through those regions beginning with a rally monday in jackson 
tenn with running mate dan quayle 
james a baker bushs campaign chairman said the debate 
really did reinforce the differences weve been talking about 
the fact that he dukakis is out of the political mainstream on a 
whole host of areas 
predictably he called bush the clear winner we also think we 
won the battle of oneliners baker joked 
in one of those oneliners bush said id hoped this had been 
a little friendlier an evening id wanted to hitchhike a ride home 
in his tank with him dukakis 
several hundred well wishers stood in misty rain at the local 
airport to welcome the vice president after his flight from 
washington bush shook hands posed for pictures and kissed a baby 
before settling in for lastminute preparations bush went to 
wait chapel on the wake forest university campus to familiarize 
himself with the debate setting 
describing what he wanted to accomplish the republican nominee 
told reporters during the flight victory i want to win but 
i dont know how you judge it 
his wife barbara interrupted and said ill tell you if you 
won or not 
asked if he felt it was the most important day of his political 
career bush replied no second most important the election 
days the most important 
bush determined to relax before the debate jogged eight 
laps on a quartermile track in 17 minutes 52 seconds 
asked if he were worried about his meeting with dukakis bush 
replied no i would have been its funny but really i feel less 
strain than i did in a couple of our other debates 
i mean i know its important and im not just saying that but 
for some reason i really do feel less strain the vice 
president said 
i know its as important probably as the convention speech but 
a certain tranquility has come over me he added it doesnt 
mean that the adrenalins not going to flow or hasnt already 
started just get back to fundamentals do your best 
bush arrived here with a team of media and political advisers 
including former sen john tower of texas pollster robert teeter 
new hampshire gov john sununu television strategist roger ailes 
and campaign aides lee atwater and stu spencer 
bush spent most of the week preparing for the debate poring 
over briefing books and holding two mock debates 
he said the preparations were not as intense not as 
cramming as some in the past i feel more comfortable with the 
issues positions and being able to spell them out in a reasonable 
period of time 
on the flight from washington bushs press secretary sheila 
tate showed off a copy of his horoscope for the day as given by 
sydney omarr in the washington post 
burden is lifted green light flashes for special assignment 
journey youll deal with persons in power positions views will be 
vindicated personal relationship is again harmonious

dukakis well i certainly hope not and its all a question of 
what our priorities are mr bush talked about values i agree with 
him what are our values isnt providing housing for families of 
low and moderate income isnt it making it possible for young 
families first time home buyers to own their own home someday 
something thats part of the american dream i think so 
you know back after world war ii when we had hundreds of 
thousands of gis who came back from the war we didnt sit around 
we went out and built housing the government was very much 
involved so was the housing industry so was the banking industy 
so were housing advocates so were nonprofit agencies so were 
governors and mayors and people all over this country who believed 
deeply in home ownership and affordable housing 
now thats the kind of leadership that i want to provide as 
president of the united states this isnt a question of a little 
charity to the homeless this is question of organizing the housing 
community 
ive talked to bankers and builders and developers to housing 
advocates to community development agencies and they want 
leadership from washington washington by itself cant do it all 
we shouldnt expect that but governors are ready mayors are 
ready builders and community leaders are ready it will require 
some funds john and we ought to be prepared to provide those 
funds 
but that too will require some choices mr bush wants to 
spend billions and trillions on star wars well thats a 
choice we have to make isnt it do we spend money on that weapon 
system in the billions and trillions or is providing some decent 
and affordable housing for families of this country something that 
isnt at least as important and probably more so because its so 
essential to our economic strength and to our future 
now thats the kind of presidency i believe in and simply to 
say well the mckinney bill will do it just doesnt do we 
need a president who will lead on this issue whos had experience 
on this issue its the kind of priority that will be at the top of 
our list beginning in january of 1989 
lehrer a response mr vice president 
bush i think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless 
lets talk about housing which the question was 
when you talked to those bankers did they discuss where 
interest rates were when your party controlled the white house ten 
days before i took the oath of office as president they were 215 
percent now how does that grab you for increasing housing housing 
is up we are serving a million more families now 
but were not going to do it in that old democratic liberal way 
of trying to build more bricks and mortars go out and take a look 
at st louis at some of that effort it is wrong i favor home 
ownership i want to see more vouchers i want to see tenant 
control of some of these projects and i want to keep the interest 
rates down theyre half now of what they were when we came into 
office and with my policy of getting this deficit under control 
theyll be a lot less 
but if we spend and spend and spend that is going to wrap up 
the housing market and well go right back to the days of the 
misery index and malaise that president reagan and i have overcome 
thank god for the united states on that one 
lehrer all right the next question is to the governor anne 
groer will ask it 
groer governor dukakis is there a conflict between your 
opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on 
demand even though in the minds of many people thats also killing 
dukakis no i dont think there is there are two very 
different issues here and theyve got to be dealt with separately 
im opposed to the death penalty i think everybody knows that im 
also very tough on violent crime and thats one of the reasons why 
my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in 
america its one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate 
of any industrial state in the country its one of the reasons why 
we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching 
out and helping youngsters all over our state the kind of thing i 
want to do as president of the united states 
you know the vice president says he wants to impose the death 
penalty on drug traffickers and yet his administration has a 
federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the 
country and which gave last year 7000 furloughs to drug 
traffickers and drug pushers the same people that he says he now 
wants to execute 
the issue of abortion is a very difficult issue one that i 
think we all have to wrestle with we have to come to terms with i 
dont favor abortion i dont think its a good thing i dont 
think most people do the question is who makes the decision and 
i think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own 
conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision 
lehrer a response mr vice president 
bush well the massachusetts furlough program was unique it 
was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had 
not served enough time to be eligible for parole the federal 
program doesnt do that no other state programs do that and 
therefore and i i favor the death penalty 
i know its tough and honest people can disagree but when a 
narcotics wrappedup guy goes in and murders a police officer i 
think they ought to pay with their life and i do believe it would 
be inhibiting and so i am not going to furlough men like willie 
horton and i would meet with the victims of his last escapade the 
rape and the brutalization of the family down there in maryland 
maryland would not extradite willie horton the man who was 
furloughed the murderer because they didnt want him to be 
furloughed again and so we have a fundamental difference on this 
one

the united states has notified kuwait and other 
friendly nations in the persian gulf that it is prepared to ease 
the convoy protection the us navy is giving oil tankers a state 
department official said sunday 
the pentagon still plans to keep warships in the troubled 
waterway to protect neutral shipping vessels from attack the 
official said 
the 14month convoy program involved a precise navy formation to 
protect kuwaiti tankers that had been reregistered under the us 
flag against potential iranian attack 
pentagon officials said last week that if the plan is finalized 
us warships would keep usflagged tankers within a defensive 
zone that would place the ships under constant surveillance 
the plan would allow a slight reduction in the number of us 
ships in the gulf perhaps by one the pentagon officials said 
speaking on condition they not be identified the united states has 
26 ships in its joint task force middle east including 17 inside 
the persian gulf itself as of sept 16 the navy had conducted 85 
convoy operations since the summer of 1987 when escorts began 
pentagon spokesman maj david super said sunday night he had no 
information on the convoy situation 
navy warships still will be close by and able to respond 
the state department official said it is definitely not pulling 
out 
however revised orders are near completion to drop the convoy 
procession without a substantial cutback in us firepower said 
the official speaking only on condition of anonymity 
he called it a slight change in configuration and said a 
final decision had not been taken yet pending thorough 
consultations with the gulf countries 
the official said the reason for the planned change in orders 
was that there had been no attack on merchant tankers in the gulf 
for at least two months as the united nations attempts to implement 
a ceasefire in the eightyear war between iran and iraq 
president reagan and secretary of state george p shultz 
participating this week in the special session of the un general 
assembly are expected to reinforce efforts by secretary general 
javier perez de cuellar to end the war that has claimed an 
estimated 1 million casaulties 
reagan and shultz strongly supported us intevention on behalf 
of free shipping against critics who feared the united states might 
be drawn into the conflict during the course of the convoy 
operation us warships were engaged in a number of firefights 
with iranian vessels but did not engage in the iraniraq war 
itself

the dream of creating roomtemperature 
superconductors is impossible unless scientists come up with 
materials different from those they are now developing new studies 
suggest 
superconductors transmit electricity without resistance various 
copper oxides are now the best superconductors under development 
but have so far worked only if chilled to at least 234 degrees 
below zero fahrenheit 
commercially available superconductors must be kept much colder 
with liquid helium an expensive and cumbersome process 
researchers believe that if they can create roomtemperature 
superconductors it may be feasible to build faster smaller 
computers cheaper superefficient power transmission lines 300

left alone trees are storage sinks that consume large 
quantities of carbon dioxide the worst of the greenhouse gases 
that scientists say are collecting in the atmosphere and trapping 
heat that once escaped into space 
but a tree felled by a logger or consumed by fire is doubly 
dangerous not only will it no longer consume carbon dioxide its 
death releases stored carbon dioxide to join the atmospheric 
accumulation that scientists say will produce major global climate 
changes in the 21st century

a longawaited study being released this week 
could dramatically change the way doctors are paid sharply 
reducing fees for many kinds of operations while raising charges 
for office visits

apprehension in the medical world since it was undertaken 2 years 
ago by economist william c hsiao of the harvard university school 
of public health 
the massive project attempts to determine the amount of work 
involved in everything doctors do from checkups and wellbaby 
visits to brain surgery and coronary bypasses so they can be paid 
what their services are worth 
there is widespread agreement hsiao said that the current 
payment system is unworkable the fees are distorted and 
inequitable

hundreds of people gathered sunday in an unusual 
officially sanctioned rally to commemorate the nazi massacre of 
jews at a ravine called babi yar but several speakers directed 
their anger not at the germans but the soviet government 
babi yar was a prelude to the spiritual genocide of the jewish 
people of our country yuri sokol a veteran of world war ii 
told at least 500 people huddled on a treelined road outside the 
gates of moscows vostryakov cemetery 
a few years ago police would have broken up such a 
demonstration as an antisoviet outpouring of nationalism but 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness only a few policemen were on hand and did not interfere

oil ministers from five opec nations met 
for three hours sunday at the indonesian embassy in an emergency 
session to deal with ways to limit production and shore up 
international crude prices 
sources said the ministers who comprise the 13nation cartels 
price monitoring committee heard a pessimistic account of the 
world oil market from subroto the organizations indonesian 
secretary general 
the group did not issue a statement following the gathering 
which included a onehour formal meeting according to one opec 
source 
we heard a long report on the state of the market which is 
not very good said a senior opec delegate who asked not to be 
further identified 
ministers from the five members of the price evolution committee 
nigeria algeria indonesia saudia arabia and venezuela were 
to meet informally for a closeddoor dinner at the saudi arabian 
embassy later sunday and hold another round of formal discussions 
monday morning 
the talks which analysts have predicted would not produce any 
dramatic results are taking place amid a crude oil market slump 
that stems largely from a production spurt by nations in the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the committee cannot take any binding decisions on its own but 
can recommend that a full meeting of the organization be called 
before its scheduled fall session scheduled on nov 21 in vienna 
to consider ways to stem production and shore up international 
crude prices 
the parisbased international energy agency says opec was 
producing 19 million barrels a day in august considerably over the 
1506millionbarrel ceiling the group had agreed to for the period 
from june through the end of the year that quota did not include 
production by opec member iran 
oil prices have hit their lowest levels since the summer of 
1986 when they fell below 10 a barrel 
north sea brent crude was quoted at 1330 a barrel on friday 
up slightly from the beginning of the week in the wake of news of 
the twoday meeting on the new york mercantile exchange the 
november contract for the benchmark grade of us crude fell 47 
cents to 1418 a barrel on friday 
according to analysts at issue in the talks is the failure of 
nearly all opec members to respect production quotas established in 
an attempt to maintain the price of oil at 18 a barrel 
opec chairman and nigerian oil minister rilwanu lukman who is 
attending the madrid meeting said last week in indonesia the group 
would examine overproduction and cooperation between opec and 
nonopec producers 
algeria has complained to saudi arabia and other gulf producers 
that failure to respect the quotas is causing serious hardships for 
other opec members whose economies are dependent on oil revenue 
since the last price committee meeting aug 3 in lausanne 
switzerland a ceasefire in the eightyear gulf war between iran 
and iraq has begun to hold both nations reportedly have stepped up 
production to earn more money for carrying out massive 
reconstruction projects 
during sundays meeting subroto welcomed venezuelas new oil 
minister julio cesar gil to his first formal opec event 
in addition to lukman and gil oil ministers attending the 
meeting are algerias belkacem nabi indonesias ginandjar 
kartasasmita and saudi arabias hishan nazer 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela
