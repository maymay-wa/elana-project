live television coverage of the joel 
steinberg murder trial helped turn a lynch mob atmosphere into a 
serious deliberative process the convicted child killers lawyer 
said monday 
ira london told state legislators that he and steinberg initially 
objected to the cameras but he changed his mind 
a television camera has a chemical effect on people london 
said it makes people more serious 
cameras have been allowed in new york state courtrooms on an 
experimental basis since dec 1 1987 the legislature is 
considering whether to extend the experiment or make it permanent 
both chairmen of the legislatures judiciary committees have 
predicted the senate and assembly would extend the experiment beyond 
its may 31 expiration date 
london whose client was convicted in january of firstdegree 
manslaughter in the death of his illegally adopted 6yearold 
daughter when the jury declined to convict steinberg of murder said 
hed like to see a permanent law passed using the regulations 
currently in place 
there was a lynch mob mentality against steinberg in new york 
city as the case began but jurors worked hard to be fair said 
london i think the television cameras had a lot to do with 
that he said 
london dismissed as misguided critics who argue the presence 
of cameras would trivialize trials and alter the behavior of 
participants he said the public received an education in the 
criminal justice process 
several full days of testimony in the steinberg trial were 
broadcast on new york city television stations and lengthy excerpts 
were broadcast nationwide on cable news network

in a muddy field near the berlin wall a young pole 
looks furtively about and pulls a bottle of vodka out of a plastic 
bag 
five marks you can have he says 
he motions to a fox fur coat on a hanger clipped to button on his 
shirt a bargain for 30 marks 17 he says 
if he sells four bottles of vodka at five marks 270 each or 
the fur coat he will have earned himself the equivalent of about a 
months salary in poland 
across town in the fashionable zehlendorf district three poles 
are painting the interior of a handsome turnofthecentury villa 
for the unbeatable price of 400 marks 220 
you couldnt get a union painter to even look at the place for 
that price said the homeowner speaking only on condition of 
anonymity 
city officials estimate that as many as 4000 poles sell goods or 
their labor illegally in west berlin now that entry into the city 
has been eased for them many advertize in the citys newspapers 
offering to do home repair work and odd jobs at prices many west 
berliners find hard to resist 
thousands of poles are also turning up on weekends at a 
fleamarket to sell everything from baby clothes to superbly crafted 
amber necklaces for hard currency such as marks and dollars 
with the polish economy in shambles the vendors say hard 
currency has become the only means to acquire quality goods and food 
items in short supply it also offers the opportunity for staggering 
profits on the black market currency exchange at home 
without hard currency you cant get anything thats any good 
said a 30yearold man from gdansk who drove through the night to 
be at the market when it opened at 5 am 
he was among a record 8000 poles who jammed a field in the 
kreuzberg district of the city on a recent weekend 
thousands of west berliners jostled through the mud to inspect 
shoes clothing household goods and food the grocery goods 
displayed in open suitcases and car trunks ranged from heaps of 
polish sausage to tins of russian caviar at dumping prices 
many poles at the market earn enough west german marks in a 
weekend to support them for several months 
ten marks on the black market in poland will get you up to 
20000 zloty or almost as much as a pension said a middleaged 
man from krakow who was selling crystal goblets from the trunk of 
his car 
a companion who said he came from warsaw added i buy goods 
in poland for 1000 zloty that i can sell here for 200 marks with 
those 200 marks i can get 400000 zloty on the black market in 
poland we can live for six months on that 
a polish house painter who asked not to be named said he could 
earn a years wages from three months work in west berlin 
under new regulations that went into effect jan 1 poles do not 
need visas to enter west berlin and are allowed to stay as long as 
three months 
however they come as tourists and are prohibited from engaging 
in commercial enterprises 
so far west berlin police have cracked down only on vendors 
illegally selling heavily taxed items such as cigarettes furs 
jewelry and alcohol 
west berlin police said that on one day alone authorities seized 
11 liters of vodka 28000 cigarettes 360 grams about 12 ounces 
of caviar and two fur coats fourteen polish vendors were charged 
with violations of import tax laws 
six poles were arrested in february and expelled after they were 
caught working illegally in the city 
customs checks have also been stepped up and the west berlin 
senate has ordered that poles caught smuggling goods be immediately 
expelled and the offense noted in their passports 
but customs officials say tourists are allowed to bring in goods 
worth up to 100 marks 54 for personal use and it is often 
impossible to prove that the goods are intended for sale 
there are too many of them and too few of us said an 
exasperated customs officer as as he made his way down a row of 
sputtering polish fiats and vans at checkpoint charley at the berlin 
wall 
around the corner where 45 cars packed to the roofs with goods 
waited for custom inspectection deals were already flourishing 
a west berliner walked away with a porcelain tea set for 50 marks 
27 three times less than the department store price

if fritz lang had known that his 1926 film 
metropolis would become a musical he might have laughed 
perhaps victor hugo would have also after all if hugos epic 
19thcentury novel les miserables could become a hit musical 
why not langs classic vision of the future 
i think les miz is the best thing ever thats what id like 
our show to live up to said joseph brooks who wrote the grammy 
awardwinning song you light up my life from the 1977 movie of 
that name 
metropolis which opened in london march 8 cost 25 million 
pounds 438 million and is the first of several largescale 
musicals to open this year in london 
its bow at the piccadilly theater follows a bad period for 
british musical productions in 1988 when chess and carrie 
flopped on broadway and cancan budgie and ziegfeld 
died in london 
brooks has cowritten the music book and lyrics of 
metropolis frenchman jerome savary who staged a hit paris 
revival of cabaret in 1986 is directing with choreography by 
tom jobe the american who starred in chess in london 
brian blessed the original old deuteronomy in cats heads 
the cast as john freeman the evil master of the machineage 
metropolis where the action takes place the romantic leads are 
played by graham bickley and judy kuhn who was nominated for a tony 
for her role in the american production of chess in a show 
that despite its emphasis on technology aims to put emotion first 
im hopeful that the music and the emotional content of what we 
want to say are what will be taken home said brooks 
brooks moved to london in 1985 with his wife and two children 
intending to write a musical and he was searching for strongly 
visual material that would transfer well to the stage 
his wife susan asked the british film institute for a list of 
its movies brooks recalled when the title metropolis appeared 
her reaction was thats the film a series of screenings 
ensued followed by negotiations with the fritz lang estate in 
vienna 
metropolis is a stupefying tale about workers in a 
modernistic city who live underground a sweet girl named maria 
soothes their unrest until a mad scientist creates an artificial 
evil maria who leads the workers to revolt the silent film a 
benchmark of german expressionism was reissued in 1984 with a 
colored tint and a score by giorgio moroder 
the play is brooks first writing for the theater he composed 
the music for the films marjoe the garden of the 
finzicontinis and the lords of flatbush and has written over 
140 advertising jingles mostly for television 
i grew up in manhattan loving all the old standards 
carousel oklahoma they all had tremendous melodies thats 
what ive tried to do 
but the initial appeal of metropolis may well lie in its 
scenery which takes up onethird of the musicals budget its 
massive grayandblack pipefilled sets evoke an oppressively cold 
mechanistic environment populated by two worlds the underground 
one of the two lovers and the elitist one ruled by the evil inventor 
freeman 
brooks and his colleagues dispute suggestions that metropolis 
is another british technospectacle such as cats and starlight 
express 
if ever a show required a big visual statement its this 
one said ralph koltai the hungarian designer responsible for the 
illfated carrie and a frequent collaborator at the royal 
shakespeare company you couldnt do metropolis on an empty 
stage with a chair 
judy kuhn who makes her west end debut as the saintly maria 
said this show is about machines its about what man has created 
as long as technology helps the show its ok its technology 
for its own sake thats the problem

since he came to power four years ago president 
mikhail s gorbachev has moved to open up a closed society the 
following article the latest in a series examining gorbachevs 
first four years looks at some of the problems the new openness has 
wrought 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
president mikhail s gorbachevs decision to permit 
freer expression has exposed longignored grievances that could 
threaten his effort to revamp soviet society 
when he came to power in march 1985 gorbachev inherited not only 
an economy in virtual ruins but a union of disparate nationalities 
bristling under moscows yoke an environment poisoned by pollution 
and a system wracked by corruption 
gorbachevs predecessors generally refused to acknowledge such 
problems and were indifferent to public opinion erecting instead a 
facade of multinational brotherhood claiming that chemicals pouring 
into the rivers and blackening the sky were not harmful and 
declaring that crime was largely a western problem 
gorbachev has lifted the veil 
democratization and glasnost have put the spotlight on problems 
which were not always taken into due consideration issues of 
language culture literature art historical heritage and 
environmental protection he told a communist party conference 
june 28 
because previous administrations were insensitive to the 
problems he said some issues began to grow more complicated 
although in principle they could have been settled quietly without 
providing a pretext for all sorts of speculations and emotional 
extremes 
nationalism alone could break the union apart the soviet union 
is composed of more than 100 national groups and several are 
clamoring for greater control of their own affairs one republic 
even climed its sovereignty 
the bloody dispute between armenians and their neighbors the 
azerbaijanis has been one of gorbachevs biggest problems 
the two southern ethnic groups clashed in february 1988 over a 
small parcel of land called nagornokarabakh it is populated mainly 
by armenians but is part of azerbaijan armenians want it annexed to 
their republic a demand moscow has refused violence over the 
issued has killed 91 people 
gorbachev first tried quiet diplomacy personal appeals for 
calm changes in the local leadership and a program to improve 
cultural and social conditions in nagornokarabakh when that 
failed troops were sent in and curfews were imposed to quell 
violence several armenian activists were arrested 
finally in january the government put the region under direct 
rule from moscow 
ashot grigoryan an armenian activist said gorbachev should be 
given credit for allowing people to speak their minds but he added 
the kremlin chief is afraid of letting armenians go too far 
if this movement continued to the end grigoryan said in an 
interview it would turn into a real revolution against the ruling 
circles 
the april 1986 chernobyl nuclear power plant accident which 
killed at least 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation around the 
world spawned a mass environmental protection movement 
armenians in the midst of the fight for nagornokarabakh began 
protesting pollution from chemical plants around their capital 
yerevan and demonstrating against a nuclear power station they 
feared could release radiation in an earthquake 
authorities agreed to scale back production at the yerevan 
chemical plants and install pollutioncontrol devices and they have 
agreed to shut the nuclear plant 
gorbachev himself noted that millions of tons of harmful 
chemicals are spewed into the air yearly destroying arable land 
vegetation and animals and he said the kremlin must in all ways 
welcome the environmental campaign 
this greater openness known as glasnost also has pushed 
authorities to acknowledge the existence of crime and the 
inadequacies of health care in the soviet union for the first time 
in a halfcentury the government released statistics showing a 
dramatic rise in murders robberies and black marketeering 
gorbachev also launched a crackdown on corruption 
in the most highly publicized case leonid i brezhnevs 
soninlaw yuri churbanov was sentenced to 12 years in a labor 
camp for taking nearly 145000 in bribes while he held the no 2 
law enforcement post in the government 
in the health field authorities admit their system of free 
medical care is woefully inadequate the one health problem blamed 
on the west aids is a growing threat here and officials 
acknowledge they need help dealing with their systems shortcomings 
residents of the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and 
estonia have begun expressing frustration with the kremlin which 
took control of the republics in 1940 
under gorbachev they have staged regular demonstrations and 
organized grassroots movements to push with some success for 
greater autonomy aimed at saving the culture economy and 
environment they say has been hurt under kremlin control 
many activists say privately their ultimate goal is secession 
from the soviet union 
gorbachev has cautiously permitted the movements to proceed and 
has installed new reformminded leaders in the baltics who have 
acceded to popular demands to make the local tongues the official 
languages restore the flags that flew when the republics were 
independent and grant more autonomy in economic and environmental 
matters 
but gorbachev and his kremlin colleagues have limits they 
declared invalid the estonian parliaments declaration of 
sovereignty in november but the soviet president indicated his 
willingness to be flexible and acknowledged his administration is 
not immune to error 
when baltic politicians complained that a proposed constitutional 
amendment would drop their republics ostensible right to secede 
from the union gorbachev admitted the leadership had erred 
we did not care about explaining the essence the meaning of 
the proposed changes he said all of us are now learning our 
lessons

standing at the sidelines of londons first major 
auction of new unknown art works were some slightly dazed artists 
suddenly in the spotlight and unsure what to think 
i think everyones feeling a little sick said emma lawton 
26 one of 25 artists whose works reaped 175685 nearly double 
what christies auction house had expected for its new 
contemporaries sale tuesday night 
anything that encourages artists is good ms lawton said 
after six of her works were snapped up at higher prices than 
anticipated at the same time this is like going off the deep end 
suddenly youre up front 
but buyers loved it an estimated 1000 people crowded into a 
hall at the royal college of art on a stormy night to bid on 132 
works by artists mostly just out of school 
christies set up neat rows of chairs for 100 people but soon 
after the gavel first fell a wall of welldressed people in suits 
and furs stood craning their necks or standing on chairs around them 
to watch or bid 
most of the artists wearing combinations of jeans hats and 
leather stood at the side of the room halfwatching the spectacle 
and talking among themselves 
we expected 60000 pounds 100000 in sales said susan 
adams a spokesman for the auction houses division in south 
kensington two young staff members there came up with the idea for 
the sale the first of its kind by a major auction house in london 
ms adams said an unusually high number of buyers were private 
individuals not gallery buyers and a lot of people came out of 
curiosity 
the highest sale price 8460 was paid for a brash red brown 
and gold painting called quartet by 23yearold rebecca price 
it was quadruple the estimate 
although some of the artists had been exhibited before none was 
affiliated with a gallery normally the first big break for a young 
artist 
christies took a 20 percent commission from the artists 
compared with 10 percent usually but waived many usual fees such as 
reproduction costs for the catalogue the auctioneers pointed out 
that galleries usually take 40 to 60 percent from the artists 
we wanted to introduce the idea of being able to sell unknown 
artists works at an auction said india dhargalkar who along 
with sarah bates spent 18 months of her spare time searching out 
hundreds of unknown artists on tips from every art school in the 
british isles 
she said they chose the works which were nearly all abstract 
brightly colored paintings on gut reaction there were also a 
few portraits and pieces of furniture 
ms price who graduated from londons prestigious slade school 
of art last year said she was quite surprised to have been 
approached by christies 
i think its all really odd she said looking around the 
auction room and pursing bright red lips its amazing that 
anybody can figure out whats going on with all these people milling 
about 
ms price who has designed stage sets and murals and illustrated 
books besides painting said it felt very nice to sell her works 
but uncomfortable at the same time 
im just trying to find out about the painting and myself when 
i paint she said the fact that its sold is like a byproduct 
john bicknell at 31 one of the elders of the group said there 
was a cattlemarket element to the affair but at our age its 
an opportunity that anybody would take 
he didnt think a christies auction would spell instant success 
however 
its pure fortune to have been chosen he said i dont 
think anybodys pretending this is the best art around

the chinese captured james george veneris in 
korea on a starry night in 1950 and the american chose not to go 
home after the war even though he suffered in the cultural 
revolution veneris is glad he stayed 
red guards accused him of counterrevolution in the 1960s and he 
was forced to work as a rag picker but life got better when 
president richard m nixon visited china in 1972 and decades of 
hatred between the united states and china began to end 
you see i just did what nixon did thats all he said 
only i did it 22 years earlier the folks in america dont 
recognize this but one day theyll come around 
the old american soldier as the chinese call him visited 
the united states in 1976 he found himself a misfit and returned to 
china where he will celebrate his 67th birthday march 30 
im living the life of riley here he said im still 
studying chinese characters three a day ive got life knocked up 
i want to live to 120 
twentytwo american prisoners of war and one briton chose to live 
in china after the korean war ended in 1953 only veneris and howard 
adams another american remain one of the others died of a heart 
ailment in 1954 and the rest have left china 
veneris the son of a coal miner was raised in vandergrift pa 
he is a gentle person with a shock of gray hair a firm handshake 
and a slight heart condition that once again has put him under a 
doctors care 
he is a man in a time warp whose conversation is sprinkled with 
expressions from maoist dogma and an america of half a century ago 
oh i got some bananas i got some bananas veneris sang 
during a recent interview from his hospital bed then he dug into a 
bedside cupboard and pulled out several pieces of the fruit just 
wish i had the rest of the makings for a good banana split he 
said 
when he and the others chose to live in china they were branded 
defectors in the west and given dishonorable discharges china 
hailed them as peace fighters and the fledgling communist 
government used them as propaganda 
veneris fought in the pacific during world war ii and joined up 
again to stop communism in korea 
heck i believed red china was going to invade california he 
said but three years in a pow camp in north korea ended the hatred 
no they didnt brainwash me thats a bunch of baloney he 
said poking with a finger to press his point i saw they were 
good people they didnt hate us they only hated the people in 
washington 
on nov 28 1950 veneris had been in korea just 27 days and was 
at the end of a retreating convoy 
i remember the day real well he said it was in the 
evening we were retreating suddenly everything stopped then came 
the chinese bugles all i could see was a quarter moon and the 
twinkling stars next day we were surrounded 
the 23 prisoners who went to china were given the choice of 
studying working in a factory or the countryside or doing nothing 
on a small monthly stipend 
i took the factory and never regretted it veneris said 
he was sent to jinan in eastern china where he worked at a paper 
mill as a lathe operator blacksmith and machine repairman 
in 1956 he met a chinese woman who would become the first of 
three wives she died a few years later of tuberculosis 
during the early 1960s he studied at the peoples university in 
beijing and wrote a thesis on how good the people are 
and thats in capital letters he said its just about 
good people 
mao tsetungs radical cultural revolution began and as a 
foreigner veneris was suspected of counterrevolution 
he returned to jinan and was forced to do hard labor 
i pulled around a cart and picked rags he said i did a 
lot of sweating 
his propaganda duties included a widely publicized speech against 
the vietnam war a second marriage ended because veneris was a 
foreigner and old friends stayed away 
after the improvement in uschinese relations veneris returned 
to the united states in 1976 for the bicentennial 
i spent a year there and must have slept in 300 homes he 
said i spoke 700 times on china i did my internationalist duty 
america had become a strange place to the exile 
all those new gadgets refrigerators that made ice phones with 
buttons on them video things he said i figured i might as 
well come back to china i knew it better 
he went to the united states again to 1984 to see sisters in 
california the only things he says he misses now are strong 
nonfilter cigarettes and good ice cream 
after retiring from his factory job veneris began teaching 
english at the university he spends his free time with his third 
wife a professor of botany and two children from his second 
marriage 
his daughter 18 sells tickets on the no 35 bus in jinan but 
his 16yearold son doesnt do much of anything except play he 
said 
blowing out a cloud of cigarette smoke the old american 
soldier lay back on the pillows and quoted chairman mao the 
road is tortuous but the future is bright 
then he grinned and said now aint that the cats meow

kingpin tuesday of masterminding a massive 1985 airlift of cocaine 
to nevada 
benjamin herrera the socalled black pope of cocaine was 
convicted of conspiracy and importation by us district court 
jurors who deliberated less than two hours before returning the 
verdict 
herrera who faces up to 80 years in prison and fines totaling 1 
million was scheduled to be sentenced may 25 
the conviction has international implications for the cocaine 
trade because federal drug agents consider herrera one of colombias 
most prominent drug lords said tom green chief of the las vegas 
drug task force 
he and brothers gustavo herrera and romero herrera probably 
operate the largest family cocaine operation in colombia green 
said 
herrera was convicted in the january 1985 shipment of 189 pounds 
of cocaine to southern nevada from bolivia the drug had a street 
value of 17 million 
drug enforcement administration agents in florida were alerted to 
the planned deal by a government informant adler barry seal 
who enabled undercover agents to infiltrate the scheme 
the drugs were flown to an airport outside of las vegas and 
several men were arrested while picking the shipment up they were 
later convicted of drug charges in federal court 
herrera was arrested by federal agents in miami in december 1987 
seal was assassinated by gunmen in baton rouge la in february 
1986 while preparing to testify against alleged drug lords in miami

in one of the largest actions of its kind the 
food and drug administration on monday warned consumers not to eat 
any fruit imported from chile after traces of cyanide were found in 
chilean seedless red grapes 
the cyanide was discovered after an anonymous threat to poison 
chilean fruit was telephoned to the us embassy in the capital of 
the south american nation 
the fda urged that all chilean fruit be removed from us markets 
while more tests continue virtually all the fresh grapes sold in 
the united states at this time of year come from chile fda 
officials said 
karen brown a spokeswoman for the food marketing institute 
which represents supermarkets said those companies that have 
chilean fruit are responding to the fda request and are withdrawing 
the product from their stores 
hours after the fda announcement canadian officials followed the 
us lead and urged stores in canada to remove all remove chilean 
produce chilean produce sent to canada first goes through the 
united states 
canadian health minister perrin beatty said canadians should 
throw out any produce from chile and should also discard any produce 
of whose origin they are uncertain if you have any doubt dont 
use it beatty warned at a news conference 
the tests were made on grape samples in philadelphia and they 
followed an anonymous threat telephoned to the us embassy march 2 
four days later the fda advised that the call was almost 
certainly a hoax but as a precaution the agency said it had 
detained chilean fruit and would continue to examine samples 
after confirming cyanide in the philadelphia samples the fda 
urged that all chilean fruit be removed from us markets and that 
shipments of chilean fruits which had not yet been distributed 
should be held for testing 
fda officials said they did not know the amount of fruit that was 
involved 
this may be an isolated incident but we can hardly take that 
chance said fda commissioner frank young 
the agency first confirmed low levels of cyanide in two grapes on 
sunday and worked through the night testing more samples said fred 
shank acting deputy director of the fdas center for food safety 
we are confident we are out there in sufficient time to warn 
the american consumer not to eat fruit derived from chile he 
said no fruit from chile is being released for distribution in 
the us food supply we are putting all the efforts that we 
reasonably can to ensure its safety 
the amount of cyanide found in the grapes is less than would be 
needed to make a small child sick but is more than would be found 
in nature the fda said 
while the fda did not announce the amount of cyanide found 
beatty told a news conference in otta that the grapes tested in 
philadelphia contained only three micrograms each of cyanide at 
that level a young child would have to eat at least 2000 grapes to 
ingest a lethal dose he said 
the fda said consumers should not be worried about fruit consumed 
in the past because cyanide is fastacting 
consumers are being advised to check the source of any fresh 
noncitrus fruit and not to eat any chilean fruit they have on 
hand the fda said in a statement 
in chile interior minister carlos caceres went on national radio 
and television monday night and blamed terrorism supported by 
international communism which does not hesitate in demaging not only 
our economic interests but also our social and moral interests 
he said chile will contrinue to be a dependable supplier to 
the international fruit market security has been reinforced 
throughout the fruitexporting process he said 
grapes make up about twothirds of the chilean fruit imported to 
the united states said the fda said other chilean fruit sold here 
at this time of year include peaches blueberries blackberries 
seedless watermelons cantaloupes juan canary and honeydew melons 
raspberries nectarines quince granny smith green apples cactus 
pears pears and plums 
the two grapes in which the cyanide was confirmed had been 
punctured and were discolored with a ring of crystalline material 
around the puncture area the fda said a third grape located near 
the other two was slashed but no cyanide was detected 
no cyanide was detected in any other fruit but as a precaution 
consumers are advised to avoid any fruit from chile at this time 
the fda said 
the agency said potassium or sodium cyanide converts to hydrogen 
cyanide in acid fruit and then can dissipate but scientists could 
not determine how much of the poison was originally introduced the 
fda said 
in the march 2 call received by the us embassy in santiago a 
male caller speaking in spanish claimed that fruit being exported 
from chile would be poisoned the call was investigated by chilean 
security officials and the us state department the fda said 
on march 6 the fda said no corroboration of the threat could 
be found and us officials said chile had taken impressive 
efforts to be sure all required controls are in place 
a second call to the embassy on march 8 was also considered a 
hoax the fda said 
the grapes in which cyanide was found were shipped to the united 
states three days before the first telephone threat the fda said 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan whose domain 
includes the fda said in a statement we regret any adverse 
effect this action may have on the chilean fruit industry and the 
people of chile

britain lived up to its reputation as a fashion 
capital for individualists in autumn collections that offered 
everything from fringes fake fur and animal prints to classic wools 
and perennial velvets 
the result was anything goes with no single direction for 
british fashion 
skirts were long or short pants were narrow or very full 
jackets were long and lean or short and swingy the looks were 
ethnic or cowboy or biker or russian or prim miss marple english 
i think anything goes this season said david sassoon of 
bellville sassoon who designs evening dresses for princess diana 
but i think people have found it difficult to buy i think theyve 
found too many kooky clothes and not enough that people will wear 
marie gavrielides of warwick ri whose company kellouies 
sells to private clients agreed saying the british shows with a 
few exceptions were too high fashion for the states 
paris is more classic she said americans are way too 
classic for most of these collections everything moves so much 
faster in england designs are very up very progressive 
the greatest excitement seemed to be generated at the young end 
of the fashion scene with the accessory and clothing firm pink soda 
setting the trend for the 1525 generation 
their collection inspired by india morocco and turkey 
featured lots of embroidery animal prints fringed scarves 
corsetlike bustiers with lurex coins bells and pom poms and 
plenty of ethnic necklaces all were topped with fake fur or 
patterned velvet bowler hats 
weve had a lot of interest from the states more than in the 
last five years said managing director david solomon 
helen storeys beaded chiffon bratops fringed zebra bolero and 
onepiece leather chaps with attached boots also were big hits in 
the young market 
some top british designers took the bizarre route during london 
fashion week which ends today 
katharine hamnetts bikerlook collection harking back to the 
1970s included a skintight black velour jumpsuit worn with 
highcut black leather briefs and a leather bomber jacket with metal 
studs bearing her latest ecology slogan clean up or die 
rifat ozbek winner of the british fashion councils designer of 
the year award returned to his turkish roots with bellydancer bras 
fringed with gold coins leopardprint pants and berberstriped 
coats 
at the other end of the fashion spectrum for autumn and winter 
were the more traditional designers who have become part of 
britains fashion establishment 
jean muir showed loose jumpsuits gina fratini had black velvet 
strapless ones molded to the body and covered with indian 
mirroredcloth jackets caroline charles reflected miss marple with 
long lean earthcolored tweeds trimmed in fakefur ally capellino 
also did a prim english look with skirts down to the ankle 
edina ronay who showed animal prints velvet suits with gold 
beading and colored venetian silks said the americans are coming 
back after several seasons in the wings 
david sassoon whose midichiffons and short sequinned wool 
jerseys were big sellers also said sales were up to the united 
states the americans want glamorous clothes that women will wear 
and they come here for evening wear no doubt about it he said 
but betty jackson who did a softer more feminine collection 
with a new aline silhouette based on tibetan and mongolian themes 
said the americans have been difficult for a few seasons now 
i think they come as voyeurs she said

several television ministries whose finances 
are being audited by the internal revenue service in the wake of the 
ptl scandal are in danger of losing their federal tax exemptions 
the irs says 
loss of the exemptions would mean future contributors could not 
claim tax deductions for donations to those ministries 
the irs investigated 23 tv ministries during the last quarter of 
1988 the agency said in a report to rep jj pickle dtexas 
chairman of the house ways and means oversight subcommittee pickle 
made parts of the report public on monday 
the service is continuing to devote significant examination 
resources to media evangelist cases robert i brauer assistant 
commissioner for exempt organizations said in a cover letter to 
pickle he identified six of those cases as involving prominent tv 
evangelists 
we anticipate that several cases involving prominent media 
evangelists will move to the final stages of the examination process 
this year brauer wrote we also anticipate that some of these 
cases will present serious issues relating to continued federal 
income tax exemption 
the report names none of the 23 ministries privacy laws prohibit 
such disclosure however it is known that one of those being probed 
by the irs is ptl which is fending off the irs and several credits 
in bankruptcy court 
the report uses numbers to refer to the cases no 15 ptl is 
under investigation for allegedly failing to pay tax on some of its 
unrelated income including rental of part of its satellite network 
for not reporting some of its income and for allowing part of its 
funds to be used for the benefit of private individuals 
in public proceedings the irs has alleged that ptl paid 
excessive salaries to founder jim bakker and some of his associates 
ptl foundered and the irs intensified its scrutiny of tv 
ministries after jessica hahn charged that bakker associates paid 
her to keep quiet about allegations that she had been seduced by 
bakker 
pickle in releasing the irs report said the agency and one 
prominent evangelist had reached agreement that led to the 
ministers payment of back taxes interest and penalties totaling 
more than 1 million over a fouryear period key issues in that 
case were the ministers pay housing and transportation 
the irs said the cases under review also involve allegations of 
political activities not fully reporting income allowing earnings 
to benefit officials of the ministry or failing to pay employment 
taxes on employees wages 
brauers cover letter said two organizations connected with 
former republican presidential candidate pat robertson have refused 
to provide records of the type that other tv ministries have 
provided voluntarily 
because the freedom council and the national freedom institute 
would not cooperate the letter stated the irs had to go to federal 
court in norfolk va to seek to enforce a summons for the records 
highlights of the report 
ministry no 1 was engaged in a lifestyle that led the irs to 
believe some income was not reported acting on an informants tip 
the criminal investigation division prepared a case that has been 
referred to a federal grand jury 
no 4 irs agents are reviewing content of tv broadcasts to 
determine whether they were primarily political 
no 8 a team of auditors and a computer specialist are 
investigating allegations of political activities lobbying and 
personal enrichment from ministry funds 
no 11 as a result of a newspaper story the irs is auditing 
the ministers individual tax return the minister is not 
cooperating 
no 12 a computer picked this ministers return for audit on 
grounds of unsubstantiated deductions the case was closed with 
payment of 3000 tax and penalties 
no 16 the irs has completed review of the books and records 
for this ministry for 1984 through 1986 the chief issue is whether 
taxdeductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefit 
of the founder and his family alleged political activities also are 
being reviewed 
no 20 the ministers personal tax return was audited he was 
alleged to have channeled church assets to personal use the case 
was closed when he reported additional taxable income

the parents of comatose 31yearold 
woman asked the us supreme court on monday to overturn a decision 
by the states highest court preventing them from removing their 
daughters feeding tube so she can die 
in november the missouri supreme court ruled 43 that joe and 
joyce cruzan could not order the removal of the surgicallyimplanted 
tube providing food and water for their daughter nancy a 1983 
carwreck victim 
this will give nancy another chance to have her wishes carried 
out through her parents attorney bill colby said in a telephone 
interview from his kansas city law office he represents ms cruzan 
and her parents who are their daughters courtappointed guardians 
attorney general william websters office said it would file a 
response to the cruzans appeal but did not think the supreme court 
would find a constitutional issue in the case 
the us supreme court has never extended the right of privacy 
to permit a patient or guardian to direct the withdrawal of food or 
water which are the basic necessities of life webster said in a 
statement 
doctors say ms cruzan of carthage has been in a persistent 
vegetative state since the accident and could live another 30 or 40 
years with daily feedings through the tube implanted in her stomach 
we know nancy would not want the treatment she is receiving 
cruzan said in a statement from colbys office what right does 
the state of missouri have to tell us that her wishes and our 
wishes do not matter at all 
the appeal argues that ms cruzans federal constitutional rights 
to liberty privacy and equal protection were ignored by the 
missouri supreme court when it refused to side with her parents 
colby said

the us bureau of indian affairs 
notified navajo officials monday that the agency will not release 
any tribal trust funds until there is a resolution of a power 
struggle involving chairman peter macdonald 
james stevens navajo area director for the bia said his letter 
to tribal officials does not involve such basic governmental 
services as welfare and law enforcement and is expected to have 
little immediate impact 
rather stevens said he intended to put the tribe on notice 
and encourage the factions in tribal government to resolve the 
dispute 
the tribal council voted last month to place macdonald on paid 
administrative leave in the wake of corruption allegations aired 
during us senate hearings macdonald has contested the legality of 
that move and others by the council insisting that he is still in 
charge 
last week macdonald ordered two tribal officials fired and had 
tribal police change the locks on the navajo council and legislative 
buildings 
tazbah mccullah a spokeswoman for macdonald said officials in 
the chairmans office monday were studying stevens letter to 
determine its impact on tribal operations 
stevens said the restriction applies to release of trust funds 
from such sources as timber coal and oil leases he said the 
navajos periodically draw on the funds mostly for tribal 
administrative costs 
he said the bia acted because it is unable to determine who is in 
charge of the tribe the nations largest 
stevens declined to say how much money was involved

minutes later then they came on and gave their report 
the countdown was longer than usual as fog and high winds delayed 
the launch by nearly two hours but malone said her part went more 
smoothly than she had expected because the launch team did such a 
good job they made my job easier 
i think i did alright 
malone expressed surprise that journalists were asking her about 
her role as the first woman to do her job 
i guess its because theyve always heard a male voice during 
commentary she said 
there are so many woman newscasters i dont really consider 
this job that much different from what theyre doing 
malone first came to the kennedy space center in 1982 as a 
journalism student at the university of alabama in tuscaloosa where 
she earned a bachelors degree in 1984 
to prepare for her debut malone provided launch commentary for 
some unmanned atlas centaur and delta launches and for the early 
portions of some space shuttle countdowns and hired a voice coach 
she is scheduled to serve as commentator again in august when 
discovery makes its ninth mission

appointed within two weeks according to james c fletcher who has 
held the job since 1986 and is eager to leave 
fletcher who announced last year he wanted to retire when a new 
administration took over the white house said he was told by 
president bushs staff that a successor would be designated soon 
ive been assured of course i was assured it would be 
february that in a week or two there would be somebody new 
fletcher said at an impromptu news conference monday following the 
launch of space shuttle discovery 
he said the failed white house effort to have former sen john 
tower confirmed as secretary of defense is one reason no new nasa 
chief has been named 
they got tied up with john tower and a lot of other 
appointments he said 
fletcher said his wait to leave the national aeronautics and 
space administration has not been easy 
im getting a little anxious about my situation he said 
im a lame duck so to speak

congress auditing agency today attacked the 
governments 1988 spree of savings and loan sales as too costly and 
said it would have been cheaper in a third of the deals reviewed to 
shut down the institutions and pay off depositors 
charles a bowsher comptroller general of the general accounting 
office said in testimony prepared for the senate banking committee 
that sampl regulators required the purchasers to invest too little of 
their own money 
officials at the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
guarantees sampl deposits up to 100000 also underestimated by 20 
percent to 40 percent the value of tax breaks offered to buyers 
bowsher said 
the report comes as white house and treasury department officials 
are reviewing a complex financing plan aimed at protecting regional 
economies from the precipitous sale of billions of dollars of real 
estate now in government hands as a result of sampl failures 
sampl regulators already control about 75 billion in real estate 
according to jerome blank of the national association of realtors 
after all insolvent sampls are cleaned up regulators will become 
the largest landowner in the united states and will have to dispose 
of over 150 billion in real estate 
discussing the 1988 sampl sales gao sharpened the tone of previous 
criticism as it presented its review of 12 of the biggest deals 
for the year regulators spent or made commitments to spend about 
37 billion to close sell or prop up 222 ailing thrift 
institutions of those 179 were sold to new owners with government 
subsidies totaling 284 billion 
regulators have said most of the rescues will be less costly in 
the long run than liquidation and were the only option for the 
cashstarved agency in the short run 
however bowsher said that in four of the 12 rescue deals 
examined the government would have been better off simply to close 
the institutions and pay off depositors 
the tax breaks offered in last years rescues totaled 7 billion 
to 8 billion and in nine of the deals examined they will permit 
the new owners to recoup their investment on average in only three 
years and in at least one instance in as little as a year he said 
the comptroller general also criticized the process for 
attracting investors to failed sampls saying it was loosely 
structured and administered inconsistently and may have 
decreased the pool of prospective bidders 
bowsher urged congress to reexamine last years deals and 
exercise options under the contracts to reduce costs including 
paying off promissory notes issued by regulators and buying bad 
loans and real estate from the institutions 
meanwhile former deputy treasury secretary rt mcnamar 
presented the real estate plan to bush administration officials in a 
private meeting late last week according to an outline prepared by 
mcnamar and obtained by the associated press it would create state 
or local real estate liquidation trusts 
the trusts would issue bonds partly backed by the federal 
government partly by state or local governments and use the money 
to buy distressed sampl real estate from the federal government 
the trusts would be independent of local government and would 
hire private sector staff who would manage the properties with the 
goal of selling them at the highest price possible over 10 to 15 
years trust managers compensation would be based on longterm 
performance of the properties under their care 
the mcnamar proposal could be warmly received by members of 
congress from energyproducing states such as texas where 
alreadyweak real estate markets could be driven into a tailspin by 
the quick sale of repossessed property 
other legislators particularly in the house may not welcome the 
mcnamar proposal members of the house banking committee over the 
last year and a half have bitterly complained about the performance 
and quasiprivate structure of the federal asset disposition 
association an agency set up by sampl regulators to manage 
repossessed real estate and bad loans 
fada critics say real estate disposal is best handled by a 
government agency less subject to industry influence and more 
subject to congressional control the mcnamar outline would put the 
real estate outside the direct control of the federal government 
white house and treasury department officials on monday did not 
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment mcnamar who 
started a merchant banking firm in los angeles after leaving the 
reagan administration said in a telephone conversation that he did 
not wish to comment 
these are just some preliminary ideas weve been working on 
they are very consistent with president bushs program and may or 
may not be useful he said

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
people who believe high price supports and supply management are the 
answer to the nations farm problems are behind the times 
the national farmers union said at its convention last week in 
little rock ark that 1990 farm legislation must increase income 
to farmers through higher price support loan rates and supply 
management of the major crops 
yeutter asked monday in a telephone interview with farm 
broadcasters about the nfu proposal said he disagreed 
we tried that in the 50s and 60s in this country and the 
policy was an ignominious failure at that time yeutter said 
there is no reason to expect it to be any less than an ignominious 
failure this time around 
the united states he said is operating much more in the global 
market than it did 20 years ago and is relying more heavily on 
agricultural exports this could not be done with higher price 
supports he said 
government loan rates essentially act as a floor on us market 
prices for such key commodities as wheat corn and cotton when 
market prices decline to the loan or support level farmers often 
take out the government loans if prices rise they can pay off the 
loans and sell their products for cash 
yeutter said he did not believe that when the us price support 
loans are raised other countries follow suit by boosting their 
prices thus keeping world markets on a fairly even keel 
even if that happened on the shortterm the higher prices would 
be great incentive for other farmers around the world to expand 
production and thereby create new surpluses and lower prices 
robert a denman nfu director of international and public 
affairs said yeutters rejection of higher supports and production 
controls raised a question about which policy has been the 
ignominious failure in recent years 
we kind of think the pricecutting policy over the last eight 
years and the way government programs have been run should be viewed 
as a greater ignominious failure denman said 
the nfu position was supported in little rock by officials of the 
national farmers organization and the american agriculture movement 
yeutter and us trade representative carla hills were in 
brussels belgium friday and saturday for talks with the european 
economic community on farm subsidies and the current uruguay round 
of negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states wants eventually to eliminate all 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies while the eec wants 
shortterm measures included in the negotiations 
yeutter reported some progress in the weekend discussions 
adding that those were confined to gatt matters and did not include 
the touchy separate issue of european rejection of us meat 
containing growth hormones 
they are delicate negotiations and its always dangerous to 
comment very much in the middle of the game yeutter said 
but he added that there had been a forwardlooking discussion 
of shortterm measures and reasonably good talks on longterm 
issues 
we certainly have not resolved the differences between us on 
either of those issues he said

private exporters have told the agriculture 
department that the soviet union has bought an additional 515000 
metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said monday the wheat was part of an 
authorization on jan 25 of more than 2 million tons under the 
export enhancement program or eep 
sims said the wheat is for shipment for april only 10200 tons 
are left in the current authorization 
with the latest sale the soviet union has bought about 4 million 
tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a longterm supply 
agreement which was extended last fall to run through dec 31 1990 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 515000 tons are equal to about 189 million bushels 
worth around 78 million at recent us farm prices of 413 per 
bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also 
included about 102 million tons of corn along with 450000 tons of 
soybeans 14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons of 
grain sorghums 
sims said the 515000 tons of wheat were sold by ferruzzi usa 
inc 100000 tons cargill inc 100000 garnac grain company 
inc 75000 louis dreyfus corp 40000 alfred c toepher 
international inc 50000 bunge corp 50000 gramplex inc 
50000 mitsubishi international 25000 and continental grain co 
25000 
the companies will get subsidies of 2270 per ton or about 62 
cents per bushel under the eep arrangement

crew members on a military helicopter that 
crashed and burned in the desert were wearing nightvision goggles 
but that was not a factor in the accident that killed 15 servicemen 
air force officials said monday 
use of the lightamplifying goggles has been questioned in a 
number of previous military crashes 
four air force reserve crewmen and 11 army special forces 
soldiers from fort bragg nc were aboard the ch3e jolly green 
giant helicopter that went down sunday night in the desert 25 
miles northwest of davismonthan air force base here 
capt carlos roque a spokesman at davismonthan said he had no 
information on the sequence of events leading to the crash and 
didnt know if there had been any radio transmissions 
sgt jill archer quoted airman 1st class john e klemack a 
spokesman for the 71st special operations squadron at davismonthan 
the crews unit as saying we dont know what height they were 
flying at when the crash occurred 
the vietnamera helicopter assigned to davismonthan was 
ferrying the soldiers from fort huachuca 79 miles southeast of 
tucson to an air force gunnery range at gila bend 124 miles 
northwest of tucson 
it went down in an uninhabited area adjacent to the saguaro 
national monument about 20 miles northwest of tucson after stopping 
at davismonthan to refuel roque said 
i looked up and i seen a yellow ball like flames coming out 
of the back said mike skrekas who lives a few miles from the 
crash site five seconds later i saw it hit the ground and then 
there was a red fireball 
a second helicopter was accompanying it but was a reasonable 
distance away and was not involved in the crash roque said 
more than 300 ch3es and similar helicopters belonging to the air 
force navy and coast guard were grounded for a week that ended 
friday to inspect for a bad part in the main rotor head navy 
cmdr david thomas a pentagon spokesman said early tuesday 
air force lt col darrel hayes said the helicopter that crashed 
was inspected last friday and had its main rotor head shaft nut 
replaced it was flown safely three times after that work 
officials at davismonthan grounded the bases five remaining 
ch3es until the cause of the crash is determined the public 
affairs office said 
roque said the flight crew was wearing nightvision goggles that 
amplify low light but that investigators had determined that the 
goggles were not a factor in the accident 
roque said previous helicopter crashes in which pilots were 
wearing such goggles were flying lowlevel or in close proxmity 
with other aircraft and that the goggles when used in close 
proximity or low level may have caused a vision problem 
he said the flight from tucson to gila bend was to be a 
regular straight level flight that is it didnt involve any 
capabilities other than flying in a straight line as opposed to 
lowlevel nap of the earth flying following the contour of the 
land he explained 
they were not doing that on this flight said roque and as 
a result when they were using the nightvision goggles they were in 
open air space and not in proximity to anything 
critics have questioned whether the goggles function adequately 
when there is no moon or in cloudy weather that obscures stars the 
national weather service said there were high thin clouds over the 
tucson area sunday night and that visibility was 30 miles the crash 
occured about an hour after sunset and about two hours before the 
rise of a quartermoon 
the orange county calif register reported that since 1978 37 
of 41 army helicopter crashes in which night goggles were used 
occurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices to 
amplify those crashes killed 65 soldiers the newspaper reported 
the ch3 series of helicopters was designed in the late 1950s and 
early 1960s and is still flown by the air force navy and coast 
guard the air force began flying the choppers in 1962 and has 63 
left in its inventory 
ms archer identified four of the victims as lt colonel lawrence 
m rolle 41 of phoenix the reserve squadron commander who was 
flying as copilot maj donald d thomas 42 of tempe the pilot 
master sgt malte breitlow 45 of tucson and tech sgt william e 
slaven 37 also of tucson 
other names were not immediately released roque said the bodies 
would have to be identified through medical and dental records 
the soldiers were attached to the 3rd battalion 5th special 
forces group at fort bragg nc said army maj richard adams 
another spokesman at the fort said they had been at fort huachuca 
since wednesday and had been scheduled to leave april 9

americas roman catholic bishops deny they were 
summoned to rome to be chided for waywardness and say their fourday 
meeting at the vatican wont affect the document they are preparing 
on women and the church 
at a news conference monday after their return the bishops said 
their meeting showed that pope john paul ii is aware of the 
particular problems the church faces in the united states 
we have a heightened sense that pope john paul and the members 
of the curia understand our situation and support us in our work 
that they recognize that it is no easy job to be a bishop 
especially in america archbishop john may of st louis said 
may president of the us conference of bishops said 
clearly there were some differences of perspective as might 
be expected in any gathering of five dozen such people but these 
differences have to do with approach and not with doctrine 
asked about reports that the bishops had been invited to rome to 
be chastised for taking too independent a course archbishop john 
quinn of san francisco said we never went to rome with the 
thought that we were to be chastised we never said were going there 
to be chastised rome never said we were going there to be chastised 
that thought developed in areas completely apart from rome or 
the american bishops i think we thought we were going there to sit 
down as brothers and talk about the things that had surfaced during 
the past several years 
may said the vatican meeting would not result in any modification 
of a document on women and the church which the us conference of 
bishops is preparing 
there was no question about our document and its development 
he said we werent advised and certainly never directed to modify 
it 
several questions touched on a statement by cardinal edouard 
gagnon president of the pontifical council for the family that in 
allowing women to help decide annulment cases we have to be 
careful that their tender hearts do not play tricks on them 
i would agree with the women of the united states in their 
consternation and their irritation about certain things that were 
said may told reporters 
he said that in replying to cardinal gagnons statement during 
the meeting we said that we believed the women on our tribunals 
had served in a most remarkably effective way and some of the best 
officers of our tribunals were women

socialist premier andreas papandreou began 
putting the political pieces together today after his government 
its credibility damaged by a financial scandal defeated a censure 
motion in parliament 
the vote just before midnight monday was 155123 
it followed three days of raucous and often angry debate and 
charges by papandreou that the united states has tried to encourage 
his political demise 
the censure motion was filed by the conservative new democracy 
party which claims papandreou and senior cabinet ministers received 
millions of dollars in payoffs in a case involving a greek banker 
now in jail in salem mass 
three deputies of the premiers governing panhellenic socialist 
movement abstained from the vote and papandreou said they were 
kicked out of the party as a result the socialists hold 157 of 
parliaments 300 seats 
had papandreou failed to receive the 151 votes needed to defeat 
the motion his government would have had to resign with elections 
held in 30 days 
in the five months since the scandal first emerged it has 
triggered the resignations of seven cabinet ministers 
prior to mondays vote papandreou indirectly accused the cia of 
helping the jailed banker 34yearold george koskotas flee the 
country 
during the parliamentary debate the premier also rejected 
washingtons denial that tom malias a selfproclaimed cia agent 
ever worked for the us intelligence agency 
malias told a parliamentary committee last week that koskotas had 
worked for the cia in a plan to destabilize the socialist government 
on sunday the us embassy issued a statement saying neither 
malias nor the others he reportedly has alleged to work for the 
cia now work or ever have worked for the cia 
the statement issued by the united states embassy that mr 
mailis was not part of the cia is unacceptable papandreou said 
in whose interest was it to allow koskotas to flee greece in 
the united states he has the entire media available to him to attack 
the government so again i ask in whose interest was it to make him 
flee he said 
the premier reiterated a call for the immediate extradition of 
koskotas who fled greece in november after being indicted in a case 
involving 200 million in fraud forgery and embezzlement 
the banker was arrested in the united states and is awaiting a 
hearing on a greek request for his extradition 
he has alleged that papandreou and some cabinet members 
authorized plans to siphon millions of dollars from the bank of 
crete while koskotas was chairman he also claimed the politicians 
received millions in payoffs 
most of the allegations were reported in the march 13 issue of 
time magazine 
papandreou has threatened painful consequences if koskotas is 
not extradited to greece before june elections 
on saturday he hinted at consequences for the united states by 
referring to his governments decision to shut down one of four us 
military bases in greece he said talks on a new bases agreement 
were continuing but that their time of stay in greece is running 
out daily 
new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis led the oppositon 
attack against the government and called the premiers allegations 
of cia involvement a childrens story 
he also repeated charges that the government was involved in 
illegal arms sales to nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and 
to iran and iraq when they were at war 
there are many large and bad smelling scandals mitsotakis 
said 
new democracy submitted the censure motion by claiming the 
banking scandal posed a danger for democracy and greece 
the party with 111 seats in parliament received support from 
some independents and a small conservative faction to compile 123 
votes for the motion the communists have 10 deputies and all 
abstained 
one independent voted with the government for the winning total 
of 155

a total of 690 million has been spent by a new 
federal board created to help bail out financially distressed banks 
of the farm credit system according to the boards first annual 
report to congress 
the farm credit system assistance boards report said 629 
million of that went to help regional banks in jackson miss 
louisville ky omaha neb and st paul minn 
eric p thor president and the boards chief executive officer 
said the 1987 farm credit act authorized the board to provide 
financial assistance to eligible farm credit system lending 
institutions and by so doing to help assure continuing credit 
services to the nations farmers and ranchers 
the law authorized up to 4 billion in aid to the beleaguered 
system that was hit hard by declining land values rising farm debt 
and the inability of farm borrowers to pay their loan installments 
from 1985 to 1987 the cooperatively owned farm credit system 
alone had losses of more than 45 billion currently the system 
has about 55 billion in loans outstanding 
the board is comprised of agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and will erwin an indiana farmer 
system institutions including those receiving financial 
assistance from the board are making progress toward financial 
viability but are not yet there the report said 
funds are raised at the request of the board by the sale of 
15year treasury guaranteed bonds interest on the bonds is paid by 
the treasury for the first five years half by treasury and half by 
the system for the second five years and entirely by the system in 
the final five years 
the systems institutions pay the principal upon maturity plus 
all interest initially funded by the treasury 
about 3706 million in the first year of operation went to the 
four banks to help them recover in return they had to carry out 
reforms to put the institutions on sound footing 
the four banks and their aid packages included federal land bank 
of jackson 376 million farm credit bank of louisville 90 
million farm credit bank of omaha 110 million and farm credit 
bank of st paul 133 million 
in addition the board assumed more than 2584 million in 
previous debt owed by those four as ious to financially healthy 
other banks in the system under an earlier bailout arrangement 
there was no breakdown for that amount 
the balance of the 690 million in expenditures included board 
expenses 2 million retirement of frozen borrower stock 21 
million interest on promissory notes payable 563000 discount of 
first bond sale 225 million and prefunding 352 million

modernday pilgrims who worry more 
about flooded basements than fur trade with the indians are upset 
with the comeback the beaver population has made in massachusetts 
wildlife biologists have stopped a beaver relocation program 
because there is no corner of the state where the toothy rodents are 
not entrenched 
theres nowhere to put them said tom decker a biologist 
with the state division of fisheries and wildlife youd just be 
moving your problem into somebody elses backyard 
the industrious animals whose dams have resulted in flooded 
basements helped the states first settlers survive state 
biologist james cardoza said monday the beavers were the reason 
they were able to sustain the colony because their sponsors wanted 
to bargain with the indians for furs he said 
by the revolutionary war however beavers had disappeared from 
massachusetts and most of new england because of yearround trapping 
and the drainage of wetlands for farming 
after an absence of two centuries two beaver colonies took hold 
in berkshire county in the 1920s 
among some of the biggest beaver headaches in massachusetts in 
recent years was a colony in the town of montgomery that drew 
spectators until the beavers set their sights in 1986 on a brook 
flowing under main street 
the animals built dams faster than work crews could demolish 
them threatening the main thoroughfare of the town of 500 people 
and inspiring one resident to hang a sign bearing a score beavers

silt a little town of about 1200 people 
along the colorado river is fighting off years of slurs and jokes 
about its name with a new bumper sticker 
silt happens 
the promotion is the brainchild of silt resident jim bailey and 
steve anderson an advertising salesman for the valley west dispatch 
in the nearby town of parachute 
silt town administrator jim yale said the idea is to get 
something to talk about and get something going in town 
several years ago the town board considered changing the name 
because of the hard time the community gets about the name silt 
the new name of pistol was proposed to capitalize on rifle a 
larger community of about 5000 people seven miles west of silt 
but a town councilor observed at the time that living in a town 
called silt is like being a boy named sue it makes you tough

on his first day as the nations first director 
of national drug control policy william j bennett took aim at an 
immediate and glaring problem washington dc 
the vast majority of the slayings that have made the district of 
columbia the nations murder capital have been drug related this 
year there already have been 107 homicides 
theres not only a real significance but a symbolic 
significance to that bennett said monday just hours after being 
sworn into office at the white house by supreme court justice 
antonin scalia fifteen minutes away from the seat of the worlds 
freest government youve got this kind of thing going on 
bennett told reporters that in the next few weeks he may declare 
washington a high intensity drug trafficking area which would 
allow him to allocate federal personnel and cash to combat the 
problem he said he hadnt decided whether he would call for law 
enforcement help from any specific agencies such as the drug 
enforcement administration the fbi or the military 
this would be an interesting test case a very hard test 
case bennett said we would be talking about moving the federal 
bureaucracy which has its own reputation and the dc bureaucracy 
which is not without a reputation moving two bureaucracies at 
once 
however he said its not a test case to see whether the 
bureaucracy will respond its first and foremost a test to see 
whether we can be helpful to a very distressing and ugly situation 
that cries out for help 
the rapid movement on the issue came as a surprise since bennett 
had declined during his confirmation hearings two weeks ago to give 
senators specifics on what he planned to do he asked them to wait 
until he conducted a complete evaluation of the situation as well as 
the dozens of government agencies involved in the drug war and 
finished his national drug control strategy a plan required within 
180 days of taking office 
but bennett said monday that it was appropriate for him to act on 
washingtons problems before analyzing the whole government and its 
budget 
we may well learn in the course of this a lot of things that 
will be useful for that sixmonth report he said one of the 
things well be doing over the course of the six months is to look 
at efforts being tried all over the country including ours to see

ten states have joined a federal pilot program 
to control medical wastes but critics say it gives too little 
protection against syringes and other contaminated items washing 
onto beaches again this summer 
the environmental protection agency said monday additional 
recordkeeping requirements for medical wastes will take effect by 
this summer in states from the great lakes to the atlantic other 
states may also choose to join the program 
the pilot program was directed by congress last year after 
numerous reports of medical wastes including syringes and other 
contaminated items being found on beaches some were forced to 
close 
the program requires under the threat of civil and criminal 
penalty detailed record keeping as a particular medical waste 
travels from origination to final disposal along the way the 
transporter and others handling the waste must sign the documents 
in addition the regulation requires waste fluids and sharp objects 
such as syringes to be separated and imposes packaging and labeling 
requirements 
the record keeping covers a broad range of medical wastes such as 
human blood and blood products human pathological wastes from 
surgery and autopsies waste from patients who have been isolated 
with communicable diseases cultures and stocks of infectious 
agents and such items as scalpels needles and syringes according 
to the epa 
epa officials acknowledged that the program even if all 10 
states agree to participate is expected to address only partially 
the problem of medical wastes washing onto beaches 
many such items come from home use and illegal drug use and are 
not covered by the additional tracking requirements officials said 
the program covers wastes that originate with physicians dentists 
veterinarians small clinics laboratories and hospitals 
nevertheless said epa administrator william reilly the rules 
will substantially increase the amount of medical wastes that 
are given close scrutiny during disposal 
but a group of 19 congressmen criticized the epa for excluding 
some categories of medical wastes including items such as surgical 
gloves and bandages even if they have been used in treating patients 
with aids or other contagious diseases 
the epa cannot make the medical waste problem disappear by 
limiting the definition of the term medical waste said rep jim 
florio dnj accusing the epa of creating sweeping exemptions to 
its tracking requirements 
senior epa officials disputed claims that some medical wastes 
were excluded even though they posed health problems for example 
they suggested a rubber glove or gown may not always be subject to 
the special tracking because by the time it is in the waste cycle it 
no longer poses a health threat 
simply a waste product coming into contact with an infectious 
agent does not constitute a health risk said sylvia lowrance 
director of the epas office dealing with solid wastes 
she said that even some items that may have been in contact with 
an aids victim or a patient with a highly communicable disease such 
as hepatitis is not always considered a health threat given how 
fragile these viruses are 
the new tracking procedures will be required under a twoyear 
program in the 10 states connecticut new york new jersey 
pennsylvania ohio michigan indiana illinois wisconsin and 
minnesota other states may choose to join the program and the 
seven states other than connecticut new york and new jersey may 
withdraw from the program within 30 days 
violators in the program are subject to civil penalties of up to 
25000 a day for each violation and possible criminal prosecution 
with a maximum 50000 fine and a jail term of up to five years

discoverys astronauts safely in 
orbit monday after a weatherdelayed launch set free a 100 million 
satellite to complete a globespanning network that will let future 
spacefarers call mission control at almost any time 
the 2ton tracking and data relay satellite its double 
parasollike antennae folded slipped clear of discoverys cargo bay 
at 410 pm est and floated into space 
we had a good deploy on time said discovery mission 
specialist robert c springer 
at a critical moment in the deployment an unexplained electronic 
signal momentarily jammed a computer used to deploy the satellite 
but then just as mysteriously the machine cleared up and appeared 
normal 
we didnt get any more of those spurious signals springer 
said 
mission control confirmed that data on the ground showed that the 
computer was functioning normally 
an hour after the deployment tdrss powerful firststage rocket 
fired and sent the craft toward a new higher orbit 
kathy sullivan an astronaut acting as mission control 
communicator with discovery told the crew the rocket firing was so 
accurate that a trim burn used to correct errors was not 
required 
fantastic news came the reply from discovery thanks a 
lot 
at 1023 pm est a secondstage rocket fired and within 30 
minutes the satellite reached its work station 22300 miles over the 
atlantic ocean 
it was a good burn of normal duration mission control 
announced 
putting tdrs in place was the major goal of the nations 28th 
space shuttle flight the rest of the fiveday mission will be 
devoted to a group of science experiments ranging from a study of 
how bones heal in space to a test of a spacecraft radiator system 
deployment of the satellite came 6 hours 12 minutes after 
discovery leaped from its seaside launch pad and raced out of view 
across a clear florida sky in a launch that marked a successful 
beginning to nasas plan to fly seven shuttles this year 
discovery its rockets firing flawlessly charged smoothly into 
orbit with five astronauts the communications satellite and a cargo 
of experiments that includes four rats with clipped bones and 32 
chicken eggs 
its a great start to a long launch season launch director 
bob sieck told a news conference at the kennedy space center 
the 957 am est liftoff was an hour and 50 minutes later than 
planned earlymorning fog so dense it obscured the launch pad 
from just a short distance away caused some delay but the major 
problem was winds five miles overhead officials feared powerful 
shear forces could tear the spacecraft apart as it raced upward 
faster than the speed of sound 
to compensate for the winds a computer aboard discovery was 
quickly reprogrammed to adjust the ships flight angle the stalled 
countdown clock was restarted and then ticked without hesitation to 
liftoff 
mission commander michael l coats a 43yearold navy captain 
leads a crew that includes air force col john e blaha 46 the 
mission pilot springer 46 a marine colonel dr james m bagian 
37 a physician and marine col james f buchli 43 
once in place tdrs will become the third and final link in a 
communications constellation that is vital to nasas future space 
plans 
by using the satellite network the space agency will be able to 
exchange radio messages with the shuttle and other satellites at 
least 85 percent of the time they are in orbit a small sliver over 
the indian ocean is the only part of the shuttle orbit blocked from 
contact 
before tdrs nasa depended on ground stations outposts with huge 
dish antennae sprinkled at points around the globe shuttle 
astronauts could speak to mission control only as they overflew the 
ground stations a link that covered only about 15 percent of each 
mission nasa will soon close six ground stations at a savings of 3 
million a month 
establishing the tdrs network has been a struggle for nasa 
tdrs1 was placed into orbit in 1983 but a rocket stage failed 
and the agency was forced to use small attitude control jets to 
maneuver the satellite into place a process that took many weeks 
and burned most of the precious control fuel 
the second tdrs was destroyed along with seven astronauts in 
the explosion of space shuttle challenger in 1986 
nasa considered the communications network so important that the 
main goal of the first mission following challenger last september 
was to put a new tdrs in place the satellite was launched smoothly 
and now hangs high over the pacific ocean 
tdrs1 now ailing and old will become a spare once the third 
satellite delivered by discovery is in place 
sharing the shuttle cabin with coats and his crew are four rats 
32 fertilized chicken eggs and a small garden of plants 
the rats are part of an experiment to test how injured bones 
would heal in the weightlessness of orbit before they were loaded 
into cages on discovery small chips of bones were clipped from each 
of the rodents when the rats are returned to earth the healing of 
their bones will be compared the healing experienced by similar rats 
on the ground 
the eggs are developing embryos at the same time as a group of 
eggs left on earth the growth rate of the two groups of eggs will 
be compared after the mission 
a similar comparative study is being conducted with two types of 
plants being grown aboard discovery

municipal officials are pointing with 
frustration to the proposed savings and loan bailout as they ask 
congress and the bush administration to consider tax increases to 
pay for urban aid 
members of the national league of cities the organization of 
municipal leaders from cities of all sizes were lobbying congress 
today armed with a list of suggestions for tax increases 
at the same time they were voicing anger over proposed rescue 
plans for the beleaguered sampl industry where estimates for the cure 
range as high as 150 billion over years 
the plan for helping banks with bad loans that they have 
already written off and never should have made is moving ahead 
while funding for the war on drugs is a billion dollars short 
said mayor terry goddard of phoenix ariz 
tell the congress we can see through the scam goddard said 
the deficit can no longer be used as an excuse to avoid setting 
legitimate spending priorities 
the nearly 3000 members conclude their annual winter meeting 
today by spreading across capitol hill to meet with their 
congressional delegations 
the leagues board of directors meeting over the weekend came 
up with the list of 16 federal tax increases its members would 
accept if our priorities are funded for urban needs 
goddard said the municipal leaders identified 14 billion in 
requests for additional federal spending that they want from 
congress and the bush administration 
they include urban enterprise zones which use tax incentives to 
attract businesses to ghettos full funding of the emergency 
homeless legislation a new housing initiative full funding for 
antidrug legislation and 7 billion for the head start program 
providing early education for disadvantaged children 
on the tax list were higher federal income taxes an oil import 
fee and broadbased energy taxes greater taxation of social 
security and limiting the interest deduction for home mortgages 
not on the list was a gasoline tax which some city officials say 
should remain dedicated to transportation needs 
in the past we have been accused of coming to capitol hill 
with a tin cup seeking a handout said goddard president of the 
league it was painful but this time we come with a balanced 
program 
the league of cities has backed higher federal taxes previously 
but the list of taxes was the organizations first attempt to 
propose specific revenue alternatives to go along with their request 
for restoration of some federal urban aid 
mayor richard berkley of kansas city mo a republican and 
former president of the league said there was some sentiment for 
higher federal taxes to cover urban needs among republican municipal 
office holders 
i think theres generally a high degree of similiarity in 
what the priorities of the democratic and republican mayors are 
maybe some differences in degree berkley said 
in the whole scheme of things were not talking about huge 
amounts of money he said 
the list was drafted because of congressional leaders statements 
that any new intitatives should be accompanied by proposals for 
where the money will come from 
goddard said that president bushs budget proposal for fiscal 
1990 while including modest increases in head start antidrug and 
homeless programs would also impose major cuts on some of the 
groups favorite programs and eliminate 82 domestic grant programs

the departure of rep dick cheney as the no 2 
person in the house republican leadership is causing an ideological 
and generational struggle for succession in a minority that has been 
losing its top people 
rep edward madigan rill a moderate counted among the partys 
pragmatists on monday formally entered the contest to replace 
cheney as house minority whip challenging conservative rep newt 
gingrich rga who had announced friday he would seek the post 
cheney was beginning the confirmation process today in his 
nomination to become president bushs secretary of defense an 
election for his successor as whip will likely come after congress 
returns from its easter recess next month 
a third lawmaker seen as a strong possibility to make the race 
rep jerry lewis of california chairman of the house republican 
conference spent monday telephoning colleagues and had not yet 
decided whether to run for the position said a spokesman 
ideologically lewis is seen as somewhere between madigan and 
gingrich 
the matchup brought to the surface a longsimmering identity 
crisis for the republicans who have been in the minority in the 
house for better than three decades 
madigan represents the old guard those who have carved out a 
role for republicans through cooperation with the majority democrats 
and by choosing their political fights carefully 
in a letter sent to his gop colleagues on monday madigan said he 
would maximize cooperation with minority leader robert michel 
rill and help president bush press his legislative agenda 
gingrich leader of a band of several dozen archconservatives 
advocates confrontation over conciliation he has been the chief 
accuser of house speaker jim wright over alleged ethics violations 
and vociferously condemns what he terms the democrats welfare 
state while advocating a conservative opportunity society 
an aide said gingrich after a weekend of calling colleagues had 
secured the support of more than 40 of the 175 house republicans 
one lawmaker rep thomas petri rwis predicted the situation 
could become a real brouhaha with the potential for a bruising 
highlevel game of musical chairs within the leadership 
the departure of cheney who as minority whip was the partys 
chief house votecounter and michels heir apparent leaves a vacuum 
in the gops top ranks in the house and was seen as a setback for 
republican efforts to regain majority status 
dick cheney was a major figure in the house republican party 
said thomas mann a longtime congresswatcher at the brookings 
institution he is a man who was able to keep the divisions 
between the older somewhat more traditional republicans and the 
younger guerrilla warriors from erupting into open warfare its 
a serious loss for house republicans 
the loss of cheney so soon after the departure of rep trent 
lott rmiss the former whip who won election to the senate last 
year and rep jack kemp rny now secretary of housing and urban 
development underscores what some see as the hopelessness of being 
a house republican 
it points to the difficulty they have in retaining their most 
talented members when other opportunities present themselves mann 
said 
an official of the conservative heritage foundation senior vice 
president burt pines said conservatives would welcome gingrichs 
participation because they believe a more activist approach is 
needed to regain the majority 
a confrontation is building between those in the house who want 
to build a republican majority and those who would become accustomed 
to coasting pines said this is going to strengthen that 
movement and maybe frighten michel out sooner michel has just 
learned to love the minority theyre happy to get some crumbs 
from the democrats 
lewis was seen as the favorite to succeed cheney should he decide 
to seek the no 2 post but such a move would open up the conference 
chairmans job and trigger a secondary scramble to fill that post 
possibly involving others in the leadership hierarchy such as rep 
mickey edwards rokla who now is chairman of the gop policy 
committee the republican research committee chairman rep duncan 
hunter rcalif might then be tempted to move up in the pecking 
order as well 
michel was said by gop officials to want to avoid a nasty fight 
within the party most in the current crop of leaders have been in 
their posts only two months and a fullscale shakeup could only 
delay organizing efforts

a one week grounding of more than 300 
military helicopters led to the replacement of a main rotor shaft 
nut on a ch3e just two days before it crashed killing 15 
servicemen officials said today 
officials at davismonthan air force base imposed a new grounding 
on its five remaining ch3e helicopters monday after ruling out the 
use of controversial nightvision goggles as the cause of the crash 
authorities meanwhile recovered the last of the bodies of four 
air force reserve crewmen and 11 army special forces members from 
fort bragg nc from the charred wreckage of the ch3e jolly 
green giant 
the vietnamera helicopter went down in flames sunday night 25 
miles northwest of davismonthan base spokesman capt carlos roque 
said flags flew at halfstaff at the base and a temporary morgue 
was set up ahead of an air force forensic teams arrival to complete 
identifications of the bodies 
its like losing a family member said capt ginny garvin a 
squadron officer 
investigators were trying to determine how high the helicopter 
was flying and whether it made radio contact with an accompanying 
helicopter or with air traffic controllers at davismonthan before 
it crashed roque said 
navy cmdr david thomas a pentagon spokesman said early today 
that more than 300 ch3es and similar helicopters belonging to the 
air force navy and coast guard were grounded for a week that ended 
friday to inspect a nut attaching the main rotor head to the 
helicopter frame he said he didnt know what would happen if the 
nut came off in flight 
air force lt col darrel hayes said the helicopter that crashed 
was inspected friday and its nut was replaced it was flown safely 
three times after that work 
neither thomas nor davismonthan officials knew whether the new 
grounding of ch3es at the base would apply to similar helicopters 
in service elsewhere 
the crash occurred after the helicopter refueled at davismonthan 
while ferrying the soldiers from fort huachuca 80 miles southeast 
of tucson to a gunnery range near gila bend 125 miles northwest of 
tucson 
the flight crew was wearing nightvision goggles that amplify low 
light but investigators determined the goggles were not a factor in 
the accident roque said 
previous helicopter crashes in which nightvision goggles have 
been suspected of being the cause were flying lowlevel or in close 
proxmity with other aircraft he said 
but sundays flight was to have been a regular straight level 
flight he said the accompanying helicopter was a reasonable 
distance away and wasnt involved in the crash he added 
critics have questioned whether the goggles function adequately 
when there is no moon or in cloudy weather that obscures stars the 
national weather service said there were high thin clouds over the 
area sunday night with 30mile visibility the crash occurred about 
an hour after sunset and about two hours before the rise of a 
quartermoon 
the orange county calif register reported sunday that since 
1978 37 of 41 army helicopter crashes in which night goggles were 
used occurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices to 
amplify those crashes killed 65 soldiers the newspaper reported 
the ch3 series was designed in the late 1950s and early 1960s 
the air force has 63 left in its inventory 
four of the victims were identified as lt col lawrence m 
rolle 41 of phoenix commander of the reserve squadron and 
copilot of the helicopter maj donald d thomas 42 of tempe the 
pilot master sgt malte breitlow 45 and tech sgt william e 
slaven 37 both of tucson 
the names of the other victims were not released 
the soldiers were attached to the 3rd battalion 5th special 
forces group at fort bragg nc said army maj richard adams 
another spokesman at fort bragg said the soldiers had been at fort 
huachuca since wednesday and had been scheduled to leave april 9

the bush administration is preparing to ask 
congress for more humanitarian aid for the nicaraguan contras at a 
time when the rebels also are enjoying greater diplomatic acceptance 
in the region than they had previously 
although no final decision has been made us officials said 
monday they expect the request probably will exceed 50 million 
contra leader adolfo calero said after a meeting with state 
department officials the request will be 40 some odd million 
dollars 
the current 27 million humanitarian aid package expires at the 
end of march and the administration request is likely to be sent to 
capitol hill before the lawmakers open a twoweek spring recess this 
weekend the officials said congress suspended military aid to the 
rebels more than a year ago 
more than 10000 contra fighters are clustered at camps in 
honduras along the nicaraguan border the administration wants to 
see the rebels survive as a unified force at least until there are 
assurances that the leftist sandinista government will carry out 
their promises to hold a fair national election early next year 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the united 
states formally made such a request monday asking honduras to let 
the guerrillas stay for another year 
the sandinistas meanwhile have maintained all along their 
interest in creating a pluralistic system but that this process was 
systematically thwarted by the reagan administrations funding of 
the contras 
there also is evidence of a softening in the honduran attitude 
toward the presence of the rebels on honduran territory 
after years of refusing to hold official talks publicly with the 
rebels and even to acknowledge the existence of rebel camps on 
national territory honduras broke the diplomatic ice monday when a 
delegation of honduran officials led by ambassador jorge ramon 
hernandez alcerro met with calero and other rebel leaders at a 
washington hotel 
hernandez spoke in unusually conciliatory terms about the 
contras declining to repeat previous honduran demands that the 
rebels be expelled from honduran territory 
asked whether the contras should be forced out of honduras before 
the 1990 elections in nicaragua hernandez said the answer depends 
on negotiations that are to be carried out in costa rica at the end 
of march by the five central american foreign ministers 
i really want you to understand that we have to proceed very 
cautiously on this he said we dont want to take any positions 
at the present moment that could impede us from achieving a 
consensus among the central american countries 
the policy of the five central american countries is based 
largely on a joint resolution approved by their respective 
presidents last month in el salvador it calls for a plan to be 
drawn up by this spring for the demobilization of the rebels in 
exchange for sandinista promises of democratic reform 
calero said there were no demands by the hondurans during the 
meeting for the evacuation of the rebels and added he was struck by 
how friendly the hondurans were for his part hernandez called the 
meeting positive 
calero said the rebel cause also received a boost on march 4 when 
he and other contra leaders met with president carlos andres perez

national security adviser brent scowcroft has 
removed himself from decisions affecting 70 companies including a 
major defense contractor because of stock he owns worth at least 1 
million and up to 33 million 
but at the same time scowcroft has notified the white house 
legal counsels office that he will seek waivers allowing him to 
take part in government dealings with some of the companies on the 
list in which his interest is insubstantial 
financial disclosure reports released monday by the white house 
also showed that chief of staff john sununu had assets and income 
together last year of between 530000 and 11 million this 
included his interest in a ski condominium a residential lot next 
to his new hampshire home and a stake in an insurance agency 
the document also said sununu a former new hampshire governor 
has decided to give up tuition benefits from tufts university for 
his children sununu has been on leave from the school since 1982 
and last year received 5500 in assistance 
the ethics in government act of 1978 requires senior government 
officials to reveal their assets liabilities and sources of income 
it does not require them to list exact amounts but rather to report 
values within a range of money such as 15000 to 50000 and 
100000 to 250000 
scowcrofts form revealed that the retired air force general was 
unable to specify for whom he provided services as a hired 
consultant for kissinger associates 
in a letter about his financial reporting form scowcroft told 
white house counsel c boyden gray that former secretary of state 
henry a kissinger who heads kissinger associates denied my 
request for a list of the clients for whom i worked scowcroft 
reported receiving 293300 for his services to kissinger 
scowcroft said that under my contractual relationship with 
kissinger associates i worked for the company not directly for its 
clients 
scowcroft has at least temporarily removed himself from decisions 
involving dozens of companies including lockheed corp a major 
defense contractor along with ibm the rand corp and aerospace 
corp 
scowcroft received over 16000 in consulting fees from lockheed 
for example and he got 50000 to perform as a consultant to the 
national council for peace and security 
the disclosure form showed scowcroft has extensive bank and stock 
holdings because officials are required under the law only to list 
the valuations of assets in monetary ranges the form indicated that 
scowcrofts holdings in 1988 were worth between 1079000 and 
3265000 
scowcroft reported liabilities ranging from 200002 to 500000 
because a part of his income came from interest and dividends 
which also needed only to be listed in value ranges scowcrofts 
report showed he earned between 527894 and 649994 
the disclosure form also showed that scowcroft formally national 
security adviser to president gerald r ford and later a member of 
the presidential commission that investigated the irancontra 
affair earned 53751 in speaking honoraria 
scowcroft whose national security post pays about 89000 a 
year also received 49452 last year for his membership on various 
corporate boards 
sununus holdings are largely in real estate 
he owns a condominium in cambridge vt and a residential lot 
adjacent to his home in salem nh and each is valued at 100000 
to 250000 he earned from 15000 to 50000 in condominium rental 
fees last year 
other major assets include a 40 percent ownership valued at 
between 100000 and 250000 in lakeside insurance agency inc it 
is listed under the name of his wife nancy 
other white house disclosure forms showed 
charles chase g untermeyer white house personnel director 
listed assets including investments partnerships and oil and gas 
holdings totaling between 155000 and 420000 
andrew card deputy chief of staff listed a twofamily 
apartment in holbrook mass as his major asset checking the 
category between 100000 and 250000 he said he earned between 
5000 and 15000 in rental income from the apartment last year 
robert m gates deputy national security adviser showed few 
assets a savings account worth between 1000 and 5000 and two 
individual retirement accounts worth from 15000 to 50000 apiece 
one for himself and one for his wife 
david q bates secretary to the cabinet listed assets of 
29000 to 100000

the government today accused communist 
north korea of preparing for war and stirring up antiamericanism as 
us forces began joint maneuvers with south korean troops 
about 200000 south korean and us troops along with naval and 
air units began 10 days of major annual military exercises 
a defense ministry statement rejected north korean charges that 
the team spirit exercises were preparations for a nuclear attack 
on the north the exercises have been held every spring since 1976 
the north should immediately stop its continuous military 
buildup and war preparations and clearly show that it is giving up 
its strategy of communizing the south by force the statement said 
north korea put its armed forces on combat alert and mobilized 
reserves in response to the exercises the north said monday that 
the exercises could trigger war 
the tension between the north and the south has been screwed up 
to the highest pitch and a dangerous situation has been created on 
the korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment said 
pyongyangs official korean central news agency 
the korean peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii when 
us and soviet troops ended japans colonial rule over the region 
the two koreas became bitter enemies and fought a war from 
19501953 the two sides are still technically at war because no 
truce was ever signed 
south korean officials said in todays statement that the north 
is trying to foment antiamerican sentiment among south koreans to 
try to force removal of the 42000 us troops based in the south 
under a mutual defense treaty 
we are compelled to point out the norths scheme to 
heighten antiamericanism and get american troops out and 
eventually realize revolution to communize the south the ministry 
statement said 
radical students other dissidents farmers and other groups in 
the south are increasingly antiamerican because of us trade 
pressure and perceptions that washington has supported authoritarian 
regimes 
a us military spokesman in seoul said this years team 
spirit maneuvers involve about 70000 us troops including the 
42000 stationed in south korea and others from hawaii okinawa and 
the us mainland 
north korea routinely charges the exercises are preparations for 
an attack on the north and puts its armed forces on alert 
the north said earlier this year that talks with south korea on 
easing tension could not progress unless the exercises were called 
off seoul refused to do so and the peace talks have stalled 
south korean defense officials said again today that the 
exercises are defensive and pose no threat to the north they 
criticized north korea for rejecting the souths invitation to send 
military observers to the exercises

us customs commissioner william von raab 
stood behind a sparkling array of bongs pipes and scales as he 
announced seizures of up to 10 million in drug paraphernalia 
were going to take away from the drug abuser the tools of his 
trade von raab said monday those who manufacture and distribute 
such products are putting yourself at risk to lose millions of 
dollars of your inventory he said 
the 306000 items seized march 1 from the contempo products inc 
warehouse in nashville filled eight 48foot containers and was the 
largest such seizure in us history he said on march 4 customs 
officials seized enough items from the award distributing co in 
philadelphia to fill four such containers the second largest 
seizure in history he said 
but von raab acknowledged that the amount confiscated would 
probably not have a measurable impact on the drug paraphernalia 
industry he estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
drug paraphernalia is sold annually 
so far there have been no arrests in any of the recent cases 
but he said us attorneys around the country are identifying 
people who might be indicted

under a new government requirement the rising sun 
will ripple over all japans schoolyards next year and the countrys 
onceshunned national anthem echo through school auditoriums 
a japanese warlord likewise will be ending his long exile from 
the history books 
the education ministry says the curriculum changes will help 
youngsters understand what it means to be japanese 
but some japanese object saying they consider the flag and 
anthem symbols of the countrys militaristic past they say the 
changes merely revive the trappings of imperialism not the truth 
behind it 
the debate over the new curriculum represents yet another chapter 
in japans struggle to deal with its past a struggle heightened by 
the death of emperor hirohito whose 62year reign encompassed both 
war and resurgence 
the curriculum to be phased in from 1990 to 1994 requires 
teachers to hoist the rising sun flag and have students sing the 
anthem at such events as graduation ceremonies 
neither the flag nor the anthem kimigayo has any legal 
standing 
the rising sun is flown in public less than the stars and stripes 
is in the united states and many schools do not follow the current 
guideline that only suggests the anthem be sung and a flagraising 
ceremony be held 
the anthem was formerly considered a prayer for the emperors 
long life now the ministry says the song seeks the japanese 
peoples prosperity centered around the emperor 
it is important to nurture a childs identity as a 
japanese says education minister takeo nishioka unless 
children have understanding and respect for their national flag and 
national anthem they will not even have the manners to pay respect 
to the flag and anthem of other countries 
masami yamazumi an education professor at toritsu university 
complained that a schools mission should be to teach meaning and 
historical background and not to force students to salute the flag 
and sing the anthem 
schools have not taught such things or the negative side of the 
emperor his wartime role for example he said 
truth must be taught to prevent history from repeating itself 
its regrettable that many schools ignore japanese modern history 
though thats the most important part yamazumi added 
japans failure to specify its wartime aggression in history 
textbooks has angered other asian nations and their protests have 
forced the education ministry to revise the texts 
takahiro miura of the liberal japan teachers union said the new 
curriculum is imperialistic because it fails to admit aggression 
and the union will urge the ministry to delete the controversial 
elements 
about 30 groups throughout the nation also have submitted 
petitions with more than 20000 signatures objecting to the flag and 
song 
the liberal tokyo teachers association said only 670 of 1700 
tokyo schools set up mourning flags for the six days suggested by 
the government after hirohitos death on jan 7 
the associations ikuya nishikawa admitted however that even 
liberal teachers have seldom discussed the emperor in class partly 
because of concern over possible attacks from proemperor rightists 
the education ministrys curriculum also is adding a 
controversial military hero admiral heihachiro togo whose ships 
sank the russian fleet in 1905 to a list of notable figures to be 
studied in sixthgrade history classes 
togo known for unquestioning loyalty to emperor and country 
became a nonperson in postwar education because of his militaristic 
connotations 
nishioka says japans strength and international position were 
heightened by victories in the 189495 sinojapanese war and the 
190405 russojapanese war 
what would have happened to japan if it had lost the 
russojapanese war he asked it can be said that this was a 
very crucial event affecting the survival of japan 
literature professor tomitaro karasawa notes that in japans 
world war iiera curriculums almost 38 percent of an ethics 
textbook and 76 percent of a japanese language text was militaristic 
and imperialistic 
a poem in a 1918 textbook read great japan great japan we 70 
million people respect his majesty the emperor as god as father and 
we must serve him 
after japan lost the war the education ministry ordered teachers 
to have students ink out such material

utah state university researchers frank 
salisbury and bruce bugbee see beyond hybrid wheat thriving in 
hydroponic gardens to a day when their experiments will help feed 
human colonies on the moon and mars 
it is that vision of mankind planted safely beyond the pale of 
earthly limitations that has kept the two plant scientists firm in 
their commitment to space agriculture despite tight funding and 
the knowledge they may not live to see their research implemented 
its longrange research that really has to be done now to be 
used later explained bugbee 38 the principal researcher for the 
universitys controlled ecological life support system celss 
project 
and its just plain interesting he added something as 
complex as a closed lifesupport system is just fascinating were 
trying to duplicate all the functions of planet earth in a 
relatively small capsule 
bugbee and salisbury 62 who serves on the national aeronautics 
and space administrations aerospace medical advisory committee say 
it could be 30 years or more before a permanent human colony is 
established on the moon and another decade beyond that before mars 
is settled 
nonetheless they are assured their work will survive them 
i dont think we can seriously talk about a permanent colony on 
the moon or mars without talking about celss salisbury said 
plants raised under hydroponics are grown in nutrientrich 
solutions rather than soil 
while funding for the hydroponic project about 130000 a year 
since it was approved by nasa in 1981 is miniscule compared to the 
billions spent on the nations manned space flight program 
salisbury and bugbee point with pride to its accomplishments 
simulating as closely as possible the conditions of a lunar or 
martian colonial farm through variations in lighting and atmosphere 
the project has grown a mexican dwarf variety of wheat yecora rojo 
with yields of 60 grams of edible wheat per square yard per day 
that is five times the estimated world record of 1214 grams 
salisbury said 
salisbury and bugbee believing they are near the theoretical 
production limits for wheat in a extraterrestrial colony setting 
say they will next turn their attention to wheats performance in 
zero gravity a crucial consideration for the day when mankind 
embarks on space voyages too long to be sustained by stored food 
to that end they are preparing an experiment for a future space 
shuttle mission nasa has approved the project but it has yet to be 
scheduled for flight the two said in telephone interviews from the 
schools campus in logan 60 miles north of salt lake city 
salisbury and bugbee say a space farm could feed the mars 
missions crew and purify air and water supplies for example a 
13squareyard space farm could feed one person indefinitely 
looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and mars 
the researchers believe a farm about the size of a football field 
could provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people 
a hydroponic space farm unlike those on earth would not be 
maintained as one huge unit but be made up of a number of 
selfcontained compartments to guard against the spread of any plant 
diseases further it likely would produce far more food than 
needed ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent more as a hedge 
against unexpected losses 
failure of a martian colonys food supply with help from earth 
at a minimum of 35 million miles away would be catastrophic 
salisbury and bugbee arent the only ones researching space food 
production 
the university of wisconsin has worked on white potatoes north 
carolina state has worked on soybeans and researchers at purdue have 
experimented with lettuce scientists at tuskegee university have 
worked on developing a sweet potato that can be grown on the moon 
in the soviet union scientists have developed a highly 
productive strain of wheat salisbury said 
in terms of yield the russians are ahead but ours is more 
efficient he said noting the soviet space wheat produces more 
but requires several times the light that its american counterpart 
does

an experiment that could be a precursor to 
space colonization was proclaimed a huge success after a marine 
biologist emerged from five days of isolation in a tiny world within 
a world 
abigail alling said the 23squarefoot greenhouselike module 
that had cut her off from the rest of earths environment since 
wednesday was truly paradise 
the three aspects of science the experiment the experimenter 
and the experience became a unity ms alling said monday as she 
emerged from the module 
what surprised me was how easy and relaxed the whole thing 
was said ms alling 29 
its very simple to say how we feel about this said carl 
hodges director of the university of arizona environmental research 
laboratory its a huge success im ecstatic 
the experiment was part of a privately funded 30 million 
research project designed to see whether human beings can exist in 
an enclosed world possibly as a precursor to space colonization 
four men and four women are scheduled to enter the 2acre 
biosphere ii structure in september 1990 for a twoyear stay 
in the experiments plants and organisms are used to purify the 
air and water and to replenish the oxygen supply according to 
margaret augustine the project director 
food is grown harvested and prepared inside the biosphere and 
wastes are biologically treated and recycled for fertilizer she 
said 
ms alling a yale universitytrained marinemammal scientist 
said she enjoyed her stay in the enclosure she said she busied 
herself by harvesting and cooking her own food and working on her 
contribution to biosphere ii which will include a 35footdeep 
1milliongallon ocean as one of its seven seperate 
environmental systems 
the test module is a selfcontained greenhouse about the size of 
a singlecar garage it is topped with a futuristic steelandglass 
canopy rising to a height of 20 feet 
lack of room forced the omission of the chicken fish and goats 
that will be included in biosphere ii but ms alling was able to 
choose from a variety of fruits and vegetables for her diet of 2500 
calories a day 
she stayed in touch with the outside world through a telephone 
and computer 
two more weeks of experiments will be conducted on the test 
module but without a human occupant 
even after the twoyear test is completed in biosphere ii hodges 
said the project will be far from complete 
when we close for two years thats just another step he 
said biosphere ii is designed to last 100 years 
the biosphere ii project is located on the 2500acre sun space 
ranch located near oracle a small town at the foot of the catalina 
mountains about 30 miles north of tucson 
the ranch is owned by space biospheres ventures a forprofit 
research company financed largely by texas oilman edward p bass 
if the project succeeds space biospheres ventures plans to 
market versions of the biosphere to governments and researchers 
studying such endeavors as preservation of endangered species or 
space colonization

a bill that would make california the 
first state to ban assault weapons was approved by the assembly but 
backers say they face a hurdle in reconciling the measure with one 
that passed the senate 
california has demonstrated that the political power of the 
national rifle association can be resisted state attorney general 
john van de kamp said after mondays assembly vote 
the measure approved by 4138 would virtually ban the 
possession sale and manufacture of more than 40 weapons including 
the type of semiautomatic rifle used to kill five stockton 
elementary school children on jan 17 
last thursday the senate overwhelmingly approved a broader 
proposal 
this is the first step in bringing some sort of sanity back to 
our communities said assemblyman mike roos who wrote the bill 
but the democratic lawmaker cautioned that supporters still face 
problems in getting a compromise bill to gov george deukmejian the 
conservative republican governor has indicated support for roos 
proposal but not the senates 
its not down hill roos said its going to be vote by 
vote every time i change a line in the bills language its a 
reason for people to drop off 
roos said he had lost some support for the bill during the 
weekend because of lastminute pressure from gun groups 
pam pryor a spokeswoman for the nra acknowledged the bills 
backers cleared a pretty big hurdle today but she said her 
group would still fight the measures both of these things have a 
long path to travel 
the two bills were introduced in january after a deranged 
drifter patrick purdy opened fire at a crowded stockton 
schoolyard killing five young pupils and wounding 29 and a teacher 
purdy sprayed more than 100 rounds with a semiautomatic version 
of the ak47 an assault rifle police say is becoming increasingly 
popular with gangs before killing himself 
roos bill started off identical to the one sponsored by senate 
leader david roberti which includes a general definition of assault 
weapons but roos bill was restricted in committee to cover about 
36 models of rifles eight types of pistols and three types of 
shotguns 
the measure with few exceptions would bar the manufacture 
import sale giving or lending of assault weapons after jan 1 
violations could bring up to three years in prison and a 10000 
fine use of the weapons in a felony could lead to an additional 
fiveyear prison term 
adults who legally possessed the weapons before this oct 1 could 
keep them if they register them with the state anyone who wanted to 
obtain one legally after sept 30 and keep it after jan 1 would 
need the same type of permit required for a machine gun which is 
extremely difficult to obtain 
roberti praised the assembly and said he would seek agreements on 
amendments to the senate version during the easter recess 
but one opponent said the state really needs tougher criminal 
laws and programs to keep mentally ill people off the streets 
the problem is that patrick purdy was allowed on the streets at 
all said assemblyman tom mcclintock referring to purdys history 
of crime and mental problems the problem is that patrick purdy 
was allowed near guns of any kind

mock versions of three daily newspapers may 
have briefly fooled readers in two states but officials were not 
amused and at least two papers planned to take legal action against 
the imitators 
thousands of lookalike front pages attacking us policy in el 
salvador were wrapped around vending machine copies of the san 
francisco chronicle chicago tribune and the state journalregister 
in springfield ill on monday 
in a news release delivered to the associated press in san 
francisco a group called citizens against the us war in el 
salvador claimed responsibility for the phony front page with a 
san francisco chornicle masthead 
over 100 activists put over 10000 copies of the special 
edition into chronicle newsboxes in san francisco the eastern san 
francisco bay area and sonoma county the statement claimed 
the real paper planned to pursue charges of product tampering and 
copyright infringement against the copycats said jessie knight 
vice president of marketing for the san francisco newspaper agency 
which distributes the chronicle 
the bogus page whose typefaces and makeup resembled those of the 
real chronicle carried headlines such as el salvador on verge of 
revolution and united states waging war on el salvador 
this kind of hoax is not the way to exercise free speech 
said william german the chronicles executive editor our readers 
will certainly see through it as a fraud upon them as well as the 
chronicle 
the baltimore sun and the arizona daily star were the targets of 
similar stunts in january 
in chicago the tribune released a statement saying it will 
take every legal step possible to prosecute the people responsible 
and prevent any recurrence 
while the right of free speech and political protest is 
understood and appreciated tampering with the front page of the 
tribune interferes with and distorts our mission as a newspaper and 
our right to do business the statement said 
several thousand newspapers were covered with the bogus front 
page which had a chicago tribune masthead a spokeswoman said 
beneath the masthead headlines proclaimed us at war in el 
salvador and death squad activities tribune officials said a 
group calling itself the people for a free el salvador said it 
made the switch 
in springfield ill steve fagan editor of the state 
journalregister said about 30 of their 200 street boxes were 
targeted those papers said the lampoon was the work of people for 
a free el salvador 
we view this as a childish prank as well as an incident of 
vandalism and criminal trespass fagan said the worse part of 
it is this is an unwarranted intrusion on our readers 
leslie schuld of the committee in solidarity with the people of 
el salvador approved of the effort but did not take credit 
there has been little in the press about what is happening down 
there schuld said in chicago the tribune in particular hasnt 
been covering the death squad activities adequately 
the san francisco activists statement said the prank was an 
attempt to get out the truth about the situation in el salvador 
we believe that actions like this can contribute to building a 
political movement in the us that can stop the war in el salvador 
and support selfdetermination for the salvadoran people it said

opening higher following comments by karl otto poehl president 
of the west german central bank the dollar fluctuated as 
speculative investors adjusted their positions and took profits 
said ichiro takeda of chemical bank in tokyo 
speaking after a bankers meeting monday poehl said he thought 
current west german interest rates could contain inflation and that 
the bank had no intention of raising them 
but after japans trade surplus was released investors started 
selling some of the dollars they bought earlier which helped the 
yen recover a bit ikeda said 
japans trade surplus widened for the sixth consecutive month 
from yearearlier levels in february to 72 billion dollars from 
52 billion dollars the finance ministry announced today 
the market is waiting for the wholesale price index report to 
come out later today which is expected to be higher than last 
years ikeda said investors are also concerned about the us 
january trade figures due out tomorrow 
on the stock market overnight gains on overseas markets inspired 
the nikkeis rise today an analyst with nomura securities said 
he said market players stepped to the sidelines before a series 
of releases of economic indicators including japanese trade figures 
the wholesale price index and the us trade figures 
if the wholesale price index growth marks more than 03 
percentage points it wouldnt be too good for the stock market 
the dealer said adding that it would discourage investors because 
price increases can lead to tighter economic policy including 
discount rate hikes 
increases in the discount rate generally discourage stock trading 
trading was moderate with the first section volume estimated at

however the disturbance continued and several demonstrators 
hurled firebombs and rocks into the range he said 
the spokesman quoted maj john anderson the range commander as 
saying the range will be reopened after the repair of 70 feet of 
fence also damaged in the protest 
the us planes that practice at the range are stationed at osan 
and kunsan air bases 
villagers have complained in past weeks that the noise from the 
practice bombing runs is unbearable they have formed a committee to 
demand that they be compensated for living with the noise or that 
the range be moved

her murder is seeking a retrial a newspaper reported today 
the genovese case became a nationwide symbol of how fear and 
apathy can override compassion 
catherine kitty genovese a 28yearold bar manager was 
stalked and stabbed to death on a street in queens on march 13 1964 
thirtyeight people reportedly either saw the attack or heard her 
cry help me help me oh god hes stabbed me but no one went 
to her aid 
winston moseley confessed to the killing and was sentenced to 
death later commuted to life in jail 
now moseley 54 has filed for a new trial charging that his 
courtappointed lawyer never told him he had been representing 
genovese in a gambling case when she died the daily news said 
the queens district attorneys office is opposing moseleys 
petition 
theres no possibility at all of any conflict of interest 
said richard piperno a spokesman for the district attorney there

police 911 emergency lines lit up as unusually explosive activity 
on the sun touched off onceinalifetime sightings of the 
northern lights causing jitters as far south as texas and 
florida 
worried sky watchers thought they spotted wildfires or falling 
debris from the space shuttle discovery but scientists advised 
people to sit back and marvel at the unusual occurrence 
wow enjoy the show said a special advisory issued monday by 
the national weather service in fort worth texas it is an 
extremely rare event for the southern latitudes of the us in fact 
it would be a quintessential onceinalifetime event 
jack horkheimer director of the miami space transit planetarium 
and a astronomy expert for the public broadcasting system said he 
had not seen the northern lights in his 25 years in southern florida 
for you to see them down here is rarer than snow he said 
chris balch a forecaster for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration in boulder colo said that multicolored 
lights in the nighttime sky usually visible only in or near the 
arctic circle were reported late sunday and early monday in 
pennsylvania new york detroit and colorado sightings also were 
reported in delaware indiana and georgia but in much of the 
nation clouds or haze obscured the show 
northern lights also called aurora borealis and their 
counterpart in the southern hemisphere are believed to result as 
tiny charged particles that pour out by the sun during solar flares 
strike the earths upper atmosphere hours or days later 
the geomagnetic storms caused as the charged particles smash 
into the earths magnetic field can also disrupt satellites and 
communications on earth but balch said he had heard no reports of 
significant problems 
experts differed on whether the continuing disturbance on the sun 
is likely to mean more northern lights this week 
joe allen a noaa solarterrestrial expert in boulder said he 
thought there was a good chance of further northern lights displays 
this week across the northern third of the country 
but balch said that although the forecast could change if another 
huge solar flare bursts out were not really looking for the 
northern lights to continue 
in utah the northern lights early monday covered about 40 
percent of the sky at one point those who rose early enough to 
witness them reported seeing a shifting curtain of red or purple 
light with occasional vertical white streaks moving from the 
northeast to the northwest and back again 
it was the most brilliant display of northern lights any of our 
people can remember in the last 30 years said bill alder chief 
meteorologist at the weather services salt lake city office 
in florida and texas the northern lights caused mass confusion 
ive been having a lot of calls said ignacio casanova a 
dispatcher with the cameron county sheriffs department in 
brownsville near the mexico border theyre just callings to find 
out what it is on 911 ive had about 10 calls theyre worried 
about whats going on 
in anchorage alaska where the northern lights are far more 
common than in the lower 48 states the color display seemed to last 
longer than usual with viewers reporting sightings over 6 hours 
sunday evening to early monday 
clear skies provided a clear view for watching the everchanging 
lights dance around a quarter moon but the lights sunday night were 
not as brilliant as they have been on some sightings in anchorage 
when greens blues and reds bounce off snowcovered mountains under 
a full moon

afghan guerrillas claim to have 
captured part of the key eastern city of jalalabad but the 
government says the insurgents were routed in their first major 
offensive since the soviet pullout 
government and rebel troops have clashed at jalalabad since march 
6 in the first major test of communist defenses since the red army 
ended its nineyear intervention in afghanistan one month ago 
official radio kabul and the soviet news agency tass said monday 
that afghan regime forces had repulsed about 14000 insurgents and 
3000 pakistani advisers after a week of heavy fighting 
as a result of the heroism and power of the armed forces the 
insurgents faced shameful and deadly defeat the radio said in a 
broadcast monitored in islamabad 
communist sources claimed government troops killed more than 
2000 of the attackers but guerrillas put their losses at about 100 
dead and 400 wounded pakistan which supports the antimarxist 
insurgents denies it has any combat troops in neighboring 
afghanistan 
the guerrillas called mujahedeen or holy warriors said 
monday they had captured jalalabads key garrison at samarkhel 
breached part of the airport perimeter and were holding the old 
section of the city 
they claimed to have captured about 700 regime troops most of 
them from samarkhel 
ghaus amer of the afghan news agency an organ of hardline 
guerrilla leader gulbaddin hekmatyar today described a lull in 
fighting the previous 24 hours as a change of tactics the 
mujahedeen are now switching to increase the siege of the city to 
avoid further bloodshed 
it was not clear whether the insurgents were preparing an 
immediate second attack 
correspondents and other eyewitnesses arriving in pakistan have 
described intense aerial shelling of mujahedeen positions between 
jalalabad and the border 33 miles to the east 
they estimated hundreds of insurgents and fleeing civilians were 
killed but had no precise figures 
the capture of jalalabad a city of about 200000 would be a 
crucial moral victory for the guerrillas who are fighting to 
establish an islamic republic of afghanistan 
the fight for the capital of nangarhar province has sent 
thousands of afghans fleeing over the border to pakistan and filled 
hospitals in this country with hundreds of wounded 
the united states pakistan iran and saudi arabia are the main 
military backers of the mujahedeen 
pakistan already shelters more than 3 million refugees of the 
decadelong war and iran hosts about 2 million 
hekmatyar foreign minister in an interim government established 
by pakistanbased guerrillas said monday that the insurgents are 
capable at any time of taking jalalabad and the rest of afghanistan 
hekmatyar who was in riyadh saudi arabia on monday for a 
meeting of the organization of islamic conference said najibs 
government will fall within weeks 
we are perfectly capable of overrunning kabul and jalalabad and 
other regions but we prefer to delay military action in inhabited 
regions we do not want to spill blood any more 
he said a qualified organization would be selected to estimate 
the amount of afghanistans losses as a result of the soviet 
military intervention and how much moscow should pay us in 
reparations

romania today said it has charged with 
spying a senior diplomat whose father and five other veteran 
communists reportedly petitioned president nicolae ceausescu to stop 
repressing his people 
in a bold challenge to the autocratic romanian leader the six 
demanded in a january letter that he improve human rights and stop 
exporting food from his shortageplagued country emigre sources say 
the official romanian news agency agerpres said mircea raceanu 
who was arrested jan 31 in bucharest had been charged with spying 
for a foreign power and engaged in steady treasonable action 
since 1974 
agerpress did not name the power 
raceanu had served for several years in romanias embassy in 
washington in the 1970s and as deputy head of the foreign ministrys 
us desk in bucharest and emigre sources said he was arrested en 
route to the us ambassadors residence 
the official yugoslav news agency tanjug quoted unidentified 
diplomatic sources in the romanian capital as linking the arrest to 
the letter to ceausescu 
raceanus father ion raceanu had joined the other veteran 
officials in criticizing ceausescus plans to destroy up to 7000 of 
the countrys 13000 villages in a resettlement campaign according 
to a text of the letter made available to the associated press 
the letters six signatories are all retired senior leaders two 
of them former politburo members their initiative marks the first 
time senior communists have banded together to protest ceausescus 
stern policies suggesting dissatisfaction in party ranks 
the letter condemns a late 1970s decree that forbids romanians to 
speak to foreigners 
it also criticizes the use of secret police against workers 
demanding their rights against old members of the party and honest 
intellectuals exercising their right to petition 
and it decries forced sunday labor and alleged systematic 
violations of private mail and phone communication 
the letter accuses ceausescu of damaging romanias economy and 
reputation 
you started changing the geography of the countryside but you 
cannot remove romania to africa the text says alluding to 
romanias increasing international isolation 
how are you going to improve romanias external relations when 
all the leaders of the noncommunist nations of europe refuse to 
meet with you 
the letter demands that ceausescu immediately renounce plans to 
destroy the villages restore constitutional guarantees to meet 
european human rights agreements and halt food exports 
in announcing the arrest agerpres made no mention of the letter 
saying only that the state security bodies had uncovered a grave 
action of betrayal of the interests of the romanian people and 
state by raceanu 
it said he managed to supply unspecified secret data and 
intelligence to the unidentified power for which he allegedly 
worked 
agerpres did not say what sentence raceanu faces if convicted 
the maximum penalty for treason is death 
the emigre sources said both raceanu and his wife were initially 
detained while en route to the us ambassadors residence but that 
she was later freed a western diplomat in bucharest confirmed by 
telephone that raceanu was invited but didnt appear 
after that raceanu was said to have been transferred from his 
post at the foreign ministry the diplomat said

a liberianregistered tanker laden with thousands of 
tons of toxic chemicals exploded in flames today spewing out poison 
gases that prevented rescuers from searching for 23 missing crew 
members officials said 
the 23038ton maasgusar was engulfed in flames about 61 miles 
off the pacific coast of central japan 
rescue and fire teams cant even approach because of the blaze 
and poisonous gas from burned chemicals that the vessel was 
carrying said yoshi nakamura a spokesman for the maritime safety 
agency we just have to stand by and wait for the fire to burn out 
by itself 
nakamura said the tankers 25000 tons of petroleumbased 
chemicals including ethylene chloride isopropyl benzene and 
paraxylene had begun to leak into the ocean 
he said the vessel was afloat but tilting to port most 
structures on the deck had burned down he said 
the crew of 23 men including 19 from the philippines and four 
from britain were missing the coast guard earlier identified the

cambodias oftenfractious resistance forces took 
a first step today toward unifying their armies by forming a defense 
council headed by prince norodom sihanouk 
in their joint statement the leaders also announced a common 
political program calling for a multiparty parliamentary 
government with western democracy and free enterprise in 
cambodia after the vietnamese withdraw 
all of them the rebel forces now are practically under my 
command said sihanouk the president of a threeparty cambodian 
governmentinexile that is fighting the vietnamese who invaded in 
1978 
sihanouk who lives part of the year in beijing announced the 
new high council for national defense together with his two partners 
in the resistance government communist khmer rouge leader khieu 
samphan and son sann who heads a smaller nationalist party 
the three have been holding closeddoor meetings in beijing since 
sunday to discuss cambodias future in view of vietnams rejection 
of sihanouks peace proposals and a planned chinesesoviet summit in 
may 
sihanouk said he was confident that china a main backer of the 
cambodian resistance will not drop its support to reach agreement 
with the soviets on a speedy vietnamese withdrawal moscow is 
vietnams main ally 
i am 100 percent sure china will continue to support my plan 
and support us sihanouk said a vietnamese withdrawal that leaves 
the vietnamese client government of hun sen to confront the 
resistance a la afghanistan is not acceptable the prince said 
in afghanistan soviets troops have withdrawn and left afghan 
forces to fight rebels 
sihanouk predicted that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
senior chinese leader deng xiaoping will agree at their may 15 
summit to pressure hun sen and vietnam into accepting his plan it 
calls for un supervision of a vietnamese pullout and free 
elections under a provisional government representing all parties 
vietnam has said it will withdraw by september if a political 
agreement can be reached on cambodias future but it promised to 
leave in 1990 whatever the case 
the main snag in advancing that plan has been the refusal of 
vietnam and hun sen to accept khmer rouge participation in a future 
government and un supervision the united states which helps the 
resistance has also been wary of a return of the khmer rouge to 
power 
the khmer rouge seized power and killed at least 1 million people 
in a reign of terror from 1975 to 1978 under pol pot who is said to 
have retired 
sihanouk said khieu samphan has agreed pol pot will remain out of 
the picture 
if they break their promise sihanouk said turning to khieu 
samphan my army will fight them indefinitely 
khieu samphan smiling broadly said his party was willing to 
accept realities in order to end vietnams occupation 
the possible role of the khmer rouge has been one of the main 
sources of conflict within the threeparty resistance sihanouk has 
accused its forces of repeated attacks on his army 
however he told the news conference no new attacks have occurred 
in several months and that one role for the new defense council will 
be to resolve such conflicts 
the joint statement said the council will ensure solidarity 
cooperation and mutual respect and assistance among the three 
resistance armies it did not say in detail how that would be 
achieved 
sihanouk said the council is a first step toward uniting the 
three armies in a national cambodian army in the near future for 
now the three armies will keep their own commanders

austrias last empress zita who 
played a key role in a failed effort to negotiate peace during world 
war i died today she was 96 
born in italy as a princess of bourbonparma zita was the widow 
of charles i the last crowned head of the hapsburg dynasty that 
ruled for 640 years 
she died at 130 am at johannesstift a home for the aged run 
by franciscan nuns at this winegrowing village on the upper rhine 
a spokesman for the house of hapsburg bernd posselt said she 
had not been treated for any particular illness but just faded 
away after ailing for some time 
posselt said her eldest son otto von hapsburg received word of 
her death while attending a meeting of the european parliament at 
strasbourg otto left for switzerland where a private funeral 
ceremony was scheduled for wednesday 
zita is to lie in state for three days at st stephens cathedral 
in vienna and a requiem mass is to be held april 1 the 67th 
anniversary of the death of her husband she is to be interred in 
the hapsburg vaults of viennas capuchin church 
zita had lived at johannesstift for the past three decades two 
plainly furnished rooms were the home of the woman who once held 
court at the versaillessized castle of schoenbrunn in vienna 
her eyesight faded in recent years but intellectually she was 
described as alert as ever fluent in five languages she remained 
keenly interested in world affairs and had newspapers from several 
countries read to her regularly even as she turned 95 
her husband had ruled over a multilingual empire of 50 million 
people stretching from what is now poland to the mediterranean 
after the allied victory in world war i he agreed to temporarily 
relinquish his imperial rights but he never officially abdicated 
zita a mother of eight and a devout roman catholic wore 
mourning black from the time charles died in exile on the island of 
madeira in 1922 
tragedy surrounded the ascent of her husband he was crowned 
emperor of austria and king of hungary after the death in 1916 of 
his uncle francis joseph who had reigned 68 years 
francis josephs wife elisabeth was fatally stabbed by an 
italian anarchist in geneva in 1897 their son crown prince rudolf 
killed himself in a suicide pact with his mistress in 1889 and 
their nephew francis ferdinand the new heir presumptive was shot 
by a serbian assassin in sarajevo in 1914 triggering world war i 
after his coronation charles i initiated moves in 1916 to 
negotiate a peace he hoped would save the austrian monarchy zita 
helped arrange secret contacts with the allies 
the gobetween was her brother prince sixtus of bourbonparma 
then serving in the belgian army who was in touch with french 
president raymond poincare in turn poincare notified king george v 
of britain 
the austrian efforts were revealed by france in early 1918 
causing an uproar and rocking the austriangerman alliance austrian 
hawks fanned public ire and the oncepopular zita became known as 
the spy of the bournons 
the 1918 exodus from schoenbrunn castle was the beginning of a 
long odyssey 
initially charles took exile in a lake geneva chateau at 
prangins switzerland but after launching from there an abortive 
combeack attempt he was banished to the portuguese island of 
madeira where he died a year later at age 34 
a widow at 29 zita turned down invitations from royal relatives 
and instead chose to bring up her children in modest environments 
first in a spanish fishing village and then in the belgian 
countryside where she raised chicken and sheep to help augment the 
family menu 
hitlers blitzkrieg sent the family fleeing to canada and the 
united states where they lived at tuxedo park ny after the war 
zita toured many american cities to promote humanitarian aid for 
europe 
in the early 1950s she returned to europe and settled at 
zizers only a few hours drive from the postwar home of her oldest 
son she curtsied before him when otto at age 18 became the new 
titular head of the hapsburg dynasty 
although the austrian border is only about 18 miles from zizers 
she did not visit the country for 63 years an austrian law enacted 
after the revolution in 1919 allowed entry only to those members of 
the hapsburg family who pledged allegiance to the austrian republic 
all but zita signed the pledge my mother felt that abdication 
would have amounted to a betrayal of my father otto explained 
once 
in 1982 austria relaxed the ban following a personal request by 
spains king juan carlos a relative of zita at her first visit to 
vienna she was cheered by a crowd of 10000 when she appeared at 
evening mass in st stephens cathedral

soon abe stolar will be able to claim the 
luggage that left moscow more than a dozen years before he did 
stolar a chicagoborn jew who spent 58 years in the soviet 
union arrived in vienna on monday with his wife son 
daughterinlaw and two grandchildren 
even in the plane i still felt paranoic i still felt we 
werent safe said the 77yearold stolar 
stolar who was taken to the soviet union in 1931 by his 
communist parents had tried to leave in 1975 he got as far as the 
entrance ramp of his plane at moscows sheremetyevo airport only to 
have the authorities drag him and his family back 
their luggage went on israel their destination its been 
waiting for them since throughout the long battle to emigrate that 
took two superpower summits and heavy lobbying by us congressmen 
to finally win 
the whole family was subdued and tired after their 2hour flight 
from moscow to vienna 
at last i got free thats all i feel said stolars wife 
zita 
it did feel great to get off the plane stolar said just 
walking into this building you could feel right away that it wasnt 
russia 
its really wonderful to be here great even though i havent 
seen anything yet i havent felt anything yet he said as he 
received a hug from linda opper a member of a chicago jewish action 
group that kept stolars case alive 
he waved an i love chicago button he said hed been saving 
for the arrival and chicago loves you ms opper said 
stolars parents russian emigres fled the depression and 
arrived in a soviet union where josef stalin was just starting the 
wave of mass collectivization and purges 
stolars father was among the millions who perished in the 
purges stolar remained in moscow and worked for 20 years until his 
retirement in the mid1970s as an englishlanguage translator at 
radio moscow 
but he was disenchanted with soviet life and decided to join the 
wave of soviet jews emigrating to israel 
in 1975 stolar his wife and son michael got almost to the 
plane when officials pulled them back saying his wife was privy to 
state secrets and could not leave for at least another two years 
in some ways the stolars were better off than other 
refuseniks those denied permission to leave the soviet union 
stolar had a us passport as did his son in 1977 israel granted 
a passport to stolars wife 
although foreigners they couldnt leave and since they had 
given up soviet citizenship a soviet requirement for emigration to 
israel they found themselves in a bureaucratic limbo 
they had given up their apartment and couldnt officially 
register to live in another when michael married in 1983 he 
couldnt go through with official ceremonies because he was not 
registered to live in moscow 
in 1985 thenpresident reagan held his first meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in geneva and the stolars were on the 
list reagan handed gorbachev of emigration cases he wanted solved 
the soviets granted the wish but refused to let michaels wife 
and their newborn daughter go 
stolar said he thinks the case was finally solved through the 
summit meeting gorbachev and reagan held in moscow although it took 
several more months to pry loose exit visas 
stolar said in moscow earlier monday that he did not consider 
himself a refusenik because he always has been a us citizen 
i was an american pure and simple and so i considered myself a 
hostage all these 13 years he said

the plobacked leadership of the palestinian 
uprising issued a leaflet today rejecting us calls for an easing 
of tension and vowing to continue and escalate the rebellion 
the underground leaders discounted us criticism of palestinian 
guerrillas attempts to infiltrate israel from lebanon and demanded 
serious and constructive dialogue with the bush administration 
the leaflet called for two days of general strikes and the 
boycott of israeli products and issued a warning to arabs working 
for the military government in occupied lands 
consider this leaflet as a last warning to them said the 
leaflet distributed in jerusalem and the west bank if they dont 
resign the strike forces will strike them violently 
the leaflet praised israels peace now movement which has 
engaged in a series of public discussions with palestinians but it 
signaled no flexibility towards lessening confrontations in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
we will continue and escalate the intefadeh it said 
intefadeh is the arabic term for the uprising 
the statement came a day after foreign minister moshe arens of 
israel met in washington with president bush and secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
to create a climate for negotiations us officials urged israel 
and the plo to reduce the level of conflict both in lebanon and in 
the occupied territories 
baker told reporters he was seeking various reinforcing and 
reciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse tension in the 
west bank and gaza strip 
according to unofficial counts 396 palestinians and 17 israelis 
have been killed since palestinians launched their uprising against 
israeli rule in the territories in december 1987 
today four palestinians a 7yearold boy and three teenagers 
were shot and wounded by israeli troops in a stonethrowing clash 
in the jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza strip arab reports said 
the army said it was checking the report 
us officials reportedly urged israel to take a number of 
measures such as withdrawing troops from heavily populated areas 
releasing some of the 5000 palestinian detainees reopening schools 
and allowing freer travel 
the plo would be asked to limit violent demonstrations and 
provocative leaflets and halt antiisraeli raids from lebanon 
arens told israel radio today that baker was of the opinion it 
was important to reduce tension to take steps that could bring 
that about but he didnt elaborate what steps 
arens added i said nobody is interested in reducing this 
tension more than us but how to do it is another question 
the hebrew daily newspaper maariv quoted unnamed sources in 
jerusalem as saying israel would continue to bypass the plo which 
it considers a terrorist organization and pursue efforts to deal 
directly with palestinians who live in the occupied territories 
the latest underground leaflet condemned zionist terrorism in 
which it alleged israeli soldiers purposefully killed and wounded 
demonstators demolished homes and arrested thousands of 
palestinians 
it termed the us proposals for lessening tension as political 
blackmail and said us efforts to label palestinian guerrilla 
attacks from lebanon as terrorism represented a onesided 
manipulation of the media that does not distinguish between 
terrorism and legitimate resistance 
maj gen yossi peled commander of the northern zone said 20 
palestinian guerrillas have been killed attempting to infiltrate in 
the last month

the leader of the rebel army fighting 
angolas marxist government says hes called a fourmonth halt to 
attacks in an effort to produce peace talks and denies reports he 
has tortured and killed critics 
rebel chief jonas savimbi who spoke at a news conference monday 
on the 23rd anniversary of the founding of his unita movement even 
brought forward an alleged victim of abuses to personally refute the 
claims 
the new york times in a dispatch saturday from london quoted 
former unita supporters as saying savimbi ordered the torture and 
killing of rebel dissidents 
it said tito chingunji former unita representative in 
washington was being held against his will in jamba the rebels 
southern angolan stronghold 
asked at a news conference about the allegations in the times 
savimbi referred reporters to chingunji now deputy 
secretarygeneral of unita who appeared along with savimbi 
chingunji said the reports were lies attempting to split the 
unita leadership 
other leaders of unita the national union of the total 
independence of angola described recent reports by the british 
broadcasting corp and the new york times alleging unita human 
rights abuses as propaganda 
in an interview at his headquarters in southeastern angola 
savimbi said his usbacked movement would refrain from launching 
any military offensive against the government until july 15 to allow 
for a possible diplomatic breakthrough in the stalemated war 
we are optimistic that there will be progress savimbi said 
if there is no production of goods by then we resume offensive 
operations 
the government has refused to negotiate with the rebels even 
though there is little prospect for a military victory by either 
side in the 14year civil war savimbi acknowledges he cannot win a 
conventional war against the cubanbacked government forces but his 
rebels have for years controlled about a third of this sparsely 
populated country of 9 million people 
savimbi said officials from several african states including 
zaire congo and the ivory coast met with angolan officials 
earlier this month in an attempt to launch peace talks 
he also said unita leaders would be meeting with cuban military 
officials in the ivory coast in about two weeks to discuss the 
withdrawal of cubas 50000 troops from angola 
savimbi has pledged not to attack withdrawing cuban forces 
cuba has agreed to a phased withdrawal as part of a regional 
peace pact also signed by angola and south africa the south 
africans have agreed to grant independence to neighboring namibia 
and to end assistance to unita which still receives aid from the 
united states 
at his news conference savimbi also offered to bow out of peace 
talks and instead send other rebel leaders the angolan government 
has been adamant in refusing any contact with savimbi 
he further said the rebels would not interfere with 
reconstruction of the strategic eastwest benguela railway 
destroyed by rebel attacks and he said he would be willing to 
release 100 captured government troops

islamic foreign ministers met today 
to arrange a swap of prisoners between iran and iraq and discuss 
ways to revive peace talks between the longtime foes sources said 
the ministers meeting under the auspices of the 46member 
organization of islamic conference also planned to discuss postwar 
reconstruction projects in the persian gulf nations 
conference sources said the meetings were also expected to try 
and heal the rift between iran and saudi arabia and hopefully talk 
the two islamic powers into resuming diplomatic relations 
saudi arabia severed ties with iran last year to protest alleged 
iranian attempts to instigate shiite moslem supporters to sabotage 
oil and public utility installations in the kingdom 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
ministers hope to convince iran and iraq to accept a simultaneous 
release of all prisoners of war a unbrokered ceasefire halted 
eight years of hostilities between iran and iraq on aug 20 but 
peace talks launched five days later have been deadlocked over the 
issue of troop withdrawals 
both countries are members of the islamic conference tehran sent 
a lowranking delegation to the meeting 
conference members mainly arab countries were expected to 
criticize irans efforts to export its fundamentalist revolution to 
neighboring nations the sources said 
the iranian delegation was expected to appeal to the conferences 
foreign ministers to support ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis edict 
urging moslems to kill british writer salman rushdie for allegedly 
blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic verses 
saudi arabia has criticized rushdie and banned his book but 
would not support khomeinis death threat 
arab diplomatic sources have said the saudis will resist irans 
attempts to project khomeini as defender of islam they said 
khomeini was bent on using the rushdie affair to arouse public 
sentiment hoping to improve unfavorable political conditions at 
home 
moslems were offended by a scene in rushdies book where 
prostitutes take their names after prophet mohammeds four wives in 
the novel rushdie also suggests that mohammed wrote the koran the 
holy book of islam rather than receiving it directly from god 
the conference sessions were held behind closed doors and the 
saudis were understood to have argued that khomeinis order only 
portrays moslems as bloodthirsty and precipitates unnecessary rifts 
with the west 
conference sources said the saudis were to offer a compromise 
proposal based on sending conference delegations to western 
countries to request that rushdies book be denounced and banned 
meanwhile the saudi newspaper okaz reported that the conference 
was to discuss collective action to regain the arab sector of 
jerusalem okaz said that islamic conference member nations want the 
sector of jerusalem occupied by israel in 1967 to become capital of 
a palestinian state 
the foreign ministers it said plan to discuss ways to bolster 
the palestinian uprising against israel in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip

frederik w de klerk chosen by 
the governing party as south africas next head of state says party 
leaders will meet with president pw botha but will not press him 
to resign immediately 
the national partys parliament members voted unanimously monday 
to back de klerk as head of state 
but botha who is 73 and suffered a stroke in january has said 
he plans to return to work wednesday and wants to stay in office at 
least until next year 
there will be discussions with him with regard to his position 
and there is nothing in the decision that says he must now step 
down de klerk told reporters after the national party vote 
i am the leaderinchief of the national party and the decision 
was in principle that the leaderinchief of the national party 
should be state president 
botha made no immediate response to the announcement by the 
governing partys parliamentary caucus the president has been 
active in national party politics since 1935 and has led the 
government since 1978 
a power struggle between botha and de klerk 52 has intensified 
since botha resigned as party leader feb 2 two weeks after the 
stroke it worsened sunday when botha said de klerk had been 
misused by some people and said he would not call early elections 
this year 
the party leader has no policymaking powers and there has been 
widespread support in the parliamentary caucus for de klerk to share 
that power with botha or replace him altogether 
de klerk who has been education minister is widely viewed as 
more openminded than botha and more likely to end the blackwhite 
political stalemate 
under the constitution adopted in 1984 south africas president 
is chosen by an electoral college controlled by members of the party 
with a majority in parliament the electoral college convenes after 
a general election 
party leaders met for more than three hours monday before the 
caucus passed the resolution which said it was in the national 
interest for the same person to be president and party leader 
it said the cabinet should discuss the position with botha but 
did not say when de klerk said the resolution did not imply the 
president should resign immediately 
until botha quit the job six weeks ago the man serving as party 
chief had led the government throughout the national partys 40 
years in power 
in a report after the caucus announcement the independent south 
african press association said the statement after the caucus 
meeting is an unequivocal demand that mr botha step down and get 
out of mr de klerks way it is now expected to be merely a matter 
of time and procedure to arrange for the departure of mr botha 
news reports said many national party officials were angered by 
bothas refusal to call elections early the latest election date 
mentioned is march 1990 
a party official was quoted in the star as saying the situation 
is intolerable and will have to be settled this week the official 
was not identified 
botha said in a television interview sunday after describing de 
klerk as misused that the new party leader was one of my good 
advisers and there was no personal conflict he appeared healthy 
and said he wanted to remain in office because it was his duty

belonging to the navajos to prod the tribe into resolving a dispute 
over the status of embattled chairman peter macdonald 
james stevens navajo area director for the us bureau of indian 
affairs said the freeze announced monday does not involve such

that it must settle the dispute over macdonald 
he declined to say how much money was involved 
the tribal council voted feb 17 to place macdonald on paid leave 
in the wake of corruption allegations aired during us senate 
hearings macdonald has denied an wrongdoing and has contested the 
legality of that move 
stevens said the freeze applies to funds in trust from such 
sources as timber coal and oil leases the navajos periodically 
draw on the funds mostly for tribal administrative costs he said 
were of the position that legally we cannot say that one has 
the authority to sign or the other group and we cant make that 
determination he said 
i agree that the bia should stay out of politics macdonald 
said in a statement 
the navajos are the nations largest indian tribe about 150000

two cities lawyers said today 
all but four are being held at westville prison in the port city

the chief government spokesman today defended 
chinas crackdown on protesters in tibet and said authorities will 
never allow the region to be independent 
in a wideranging news conference yuan mu also denounced dissent 
within china he said a battle to improve the economy is showing 
results 
asked about recent campaigns by chinese intellectuals calling for 
democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners yuan 
said we are not happy with this situation 
chinas constitution yuan said guarantees freedom of speech 
but no one is allowed to infringe upon the interests of the state 
society and other citizens 
he said some critics of the government whom he did not name 
were denying the basic tenets of marxism and rule of the communist 
party and relying on foreign forces to spread their message 
this is something we are not in favor of he said china 
has no intention to import from western political systems things 
which are not in keeping with reality in china 
yuan denied china has any political prisoners 
china showed its displeasure with political activism by 
preventing astrophysicist fang lizhi the nations best known 
dissident from attending a banquet held by president bush during 
bushs visit last month 
asked about tibet where dozens of people have died in 
antichinese riots since 1987 including 16 people killed last week 
yuan said conflicts arise there because some separatists 
want to split tibet from the motherland and we wont allow that 
the channel for dialogue is always open with tibets exiled 
spiritual leader the dalai lama yuan said 
the dalai lama has agreed to talk to the chinese but china 
rejects his proposals to give tibet greater regional autonomy 
yuan said chinas sixmonth effort to reduce an inflation rate 
officially set at 26 percent has had some success although 
further efforts will be faced with great difficulties 
he also said government reassertion of controls over many aspects 
of the economy is not a setback for the 10yearold policies of 
marketoriented reforms 
while enlivening the economy chaos cant appear he said 
good order must be maintained while invigorating enterprises 
saving deposits are on the rise the momentum of price rises has 
leveled off since the beginning of the year and industrial growth 
through february has been held to a manageable 8 percent less than 
half the overheated rate of the past year he said 
yuan said further reforms in the nations heavily subsidized 
price system deemed crucial to increased productivity and economic 
efficiency will slow this year because of the inflation problem 
asked if the government would meet its goal of substantially 
lowering inflation this year yuan said it will be very 
difficult that remains to be seen

a doctor pleaded guilty to charges he bought 
blood from junkies and the poor and then billed medicaid for 36 
million worth of unnecessary lab tests 
prosecutor edward j kuriansky of the attorney generals office 
called the scam the largest and most nefarious fraud ever 
perpetrated on this countrys health care system 
dr surinder singh panshi 40 pleaded guilty monday to all 127 
counts against him 
panshi recruited junkies and the poor to sell a pint of blood for 
10 investigators raiding apartments where the blood was given 
often found lines of poor people waiting to get in said sonya 
hoover a spokeswoman for kuriansky 
tests on the blood then were performed in panshis laboratories 
where one pint could yield 2000 in billings to medicaid the 
federal healthcare program for the poor said kuriansky 
in 2 years the labs billed medicaid more than 316 million 
officials do not know how much of the total was legitimate 
the 36 million is what we felt we could prove in a court of 
law hoover said 
state supreme court justice herbert a posner ordered the labs to 
repay the 36 million the judge indicated he would give panshi a 
five to 10year prison term at sentencing april 6 and order him to 
repay 300000 
officials began looking into the scam after emergency room 
doctors reported that junkies were showing up with half their 
blood supply gone said hoover 
panshi pleaded guilty to grand larceny conspiracy offering a 
false instrument for filing and falsifying business records 
his father gurdial singh panshi is also charged in the case and 
is the subject of an international manhunt

amnesty international today urged cambodia to 
furnish information about hundreds of political prisoners the human 
rights group says remain jailed despite an amnesty proclaimed last 
may 
amnesty said it has names of more than 400 people including some 
prisoners arrested as long ago as 1979 who have yet to be charged or 
tried and others who may have died in jail 
amnesty international asks for an independent and impartial 
investigation into the deaths of these prisoners the londonbased 
organization said in a statement issued by its french section 
it said the cambodian council of state declared an amnesty for 
political prisoners in may 1988 but it is difficult to see who 
benefited from it whats more sentences have been prolonged for 
prisoners refusing to repent 
amnesty said 412 people were arrested in the first nine months of 
1988 all considered hidden enemy elements 
in the course of recent years amnesty international has made 
known on numerous occasions its preoccupation with the allegations 
of torture and the detention of numerous political prisoners in 
cambodia amnesty said in june 1987 the organization 
published a report on this subject the cambodia government has 
never reacted to requests for information and to proposals for 
sending a delegation to the country

seven state corrections officials face 
disciplinary hearings for their roles in approving an eighthour 
pass for an inmate who allagedly murdered his exwife while he was 
out of prison 
gov evan bayh announced the proceedings monday as he received an 
internal report that showed officials knew that alan l matheney 
harbored ill will toward his exwife and that she had expressed fear 
over any plan to release him 
matheney 38 is charged in the march 3 beating death of lisa 
marie bianco 29 outside her home in mishawaka 
among those facing hearings which could begin this week are the 
superintendent of the correctional industrial complex at pendleton 
where matheney was serving an eightyear sentence for beating ms 
bianco and confining their children in 1987 
he had no business being part of the furlough program said 
bayh who has suspended the program pending review by new correction 
commissioner james e aiken 
the report by board of correction chairwoman virginia dill 
mccarty said officials had denied matheneys requests for passes six 
times bayh and mccarty also said officials should have notified the 
prosecutors office or bianco of the pass 
a prison counselor replying to a letter from bianco had written 
the woman in january to say she would be notified before matheneys 
release the report said 
we have a questionable program implemented poorly compounded 
by human error bayh said 
aiken serving his first day on the job monday said it is 
impossible to say that the slaying could have been prevented even if 
the program had been administered more strictly 
bayh said the seven correction officials two of whom were 
suspended last week could receive punishments ranging from verbal 
reprimands to dismissal 
those scheduled for hearings also include the director of the 
division of adult institutions and two assistant superintendents 
mccarty said prison officials first behaved well in response to 
matheneys requests for passes but as time passed the combination 
of lack of clear lines of authority lack of procedures perhaps cic 
personnels lack of training in special assignment procedures and 
human error caused the system to fail

attacks

town of bongaigaon in assam state 
police said two bombs went off in a crowded marketplace and a 
third occurred near a railroad crossing

the bombs were planted by bodo tribespeople who are demanding a 
separate homeland on the northern bank of the brahmaputra river in 
assam a remote and hilly state bordering bangladesh and bhutan 
the bombings were the most serious attacks attributed to the 
bodos since they began their separatist campaign in 1987 claiming 
discrimination by other settlers of the area 
todays deaths raise to 99 the number of people reported killed 
by bodo militants at least 44 of the victims have been killed since 
feb 8

czech playwright and activist vaclav 
havel imprisoned after being convicted of taking part in a protest 
will get an appeal hearing on march 21 his brother said today 
ivan havel speaking by telephone from prague said the 
prosecution also has appealed for a longer sentence and a fine for 
his brother 
the playwright filed an appeal seeking to overturn the conviction 
immediately after a prague court sentenced him feb 21 to nine 
months in jail on charges of incitement and obstructing a police 
officer 
the charges arose from an unprecedented week of public protest in 
prague in january the protests marked the 20th anniversary of the 
death of czech student jan palach who set himself on fire in 1969 
to protest the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
havels jailing provoked strong protests from several western 
nations and even from the east bloc where polish premier mieczyslaw 
rakowski attended a warsaw premiere of two havel plays both banned 
in czechoslovakia the weekend after the prague trial 
the sentencing was part of a communist crackdown on dissent that 
resulted in the jailing of two more activists last week and led to 
fines jail terms or suspended sentences for seven other dissidents 
the londonbased emigre publishing house palach press said monday 
that two leaders of the independent peace association who were 
arrested in october will be tried in prague on thursday on charges 
of incitement if convicted they could be jailed for up to five 
years 
hana marvanova and tomas dvorak have been charged with incitement 
on grounds of addressing a crowd at an aug 21 rally in prague that 
turned into a demonstration by about 10000 people protesting the 
sovietled invasion of 1968 that crushed communist reforms 
the two face an additional charge of preparing to incite in 
connection with an oct 28 demonstration to mark the 70th 
anniversary of czechoslovakias preworld war ii independence 
palach press said 
also it said a brno cultural activist eva vidlarova will be 
tried march 23 on charges she organized a petition for another 
jailed cultural activist

one man died today as fire gutted the top two 
floors of a 27story building housing the governments radio and 
television services it was the second blaze in less than a year to 
hit the cairo landmark on the banks of the nile 
officials in the building and witnesses said the fire started at 
715 am and was under control two hours later it was restricted 
to the top floors and roof which holds a transmitting tower 
immediately after the blaze was extinguished cairo governor 
youssef sabry abutaleb said it caused no casualties but police 
sources reported later that firefighters searching the ruins found a 
mans charred body on the 27th floor they identified it as that of 
wasfi zaki abdelmalaak a night watchman 
two firefighters and five employees in the building were treated 
for smoke inhalation the sources said on condition of anonymity 
official radio cairo broadcast a government statement saying a 
malfunction in a subsidiary electric connection far away from the 
main cables powering radio transmissions caused the fire 
interior minister zaki badr who was at the scene said the fire 
was being investigated he ruled out sabotage 
the two top floors of the 29yearold building contain 
administrative offices and were believed to have been unoccupied 
when the fire began the work day for radio and television 
administrative employees normally begins after 8 am 
about two dozen fire engines rushed to the scene where flames 
poured out of the two floors and licked at the bottom of the roof 
but the first ladders only went up the side of the building an hour 
after the fire began 
two military helicopters circled above and river police provided 
special boats to supply additional water for firefighters 
an electrical short circuit caused a smoky fire on the eighth 
floor of the building last april and 40 people were treated for 
smoke inhalation 
the building houses about 6000 people at peak working hours 
employees of state radio and television broadcast artists and the 
staff of the information ministry that controls them several 
hundred people probably were in the building at the time of the 
fire most of them in the first nine floors officials said

bartenders mixed singapore slings by the dozen 
today as visitors savored a last taste of the old orient before 
raffles hotel closed for a twoyear renovation 
the hotel established in 1886 was the social center for the 
grand and the beautiful when this southeast asian island was a 
british colony the raffles guests once included such writers as 
somerset maugham rudyard kipling and joseph conrad 
maugham said raffles stands for all the fables of the exotic 
east kipling advised eating there but sleeping elsewhere he said 
the beds were uncomfortable 
visitors today thronged the hotels bar where the singapore 
sling was invented 74 years ago others wandered around the 
groundfloor lobbies and shops where sadfaced staff sold tshirts 
coffee mugs and other souvenirs of raffles final hours 
the 127room hotel was to close at midnight for renovation of the 
building and construction of an extension at a cost of 78 million 
it is to reopen in 1991 as a luxury hotel to compete with the 
skyscraper hotels that have opened in recent years renovators also 
plan to retain raffles oldworld features 
the hotel owner dbs land ltd is an arm of development bank 
singapore of which the singapore government owns a majority 
the threestory hotel is named after sir stamford raffles a 19th 
century british official of the east india co he is regarded as the 
founder of colonial singapore 
during the japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 the hotel is 
reputed to have been the center of the japanese secret police the 
kempeitai 
british colonial officials returned after the war to patronize 
raffles after singapore became independent in 1965 the hotel still 
had a magnetic draw for those who wanted to taste the orient 
the posh new hotels in the city offer much more comfort and 
service but lack the charm of raffles which relies on high 
ceilings and whirring fans to dispel singapores equatorial heat 
air conditioning was installed in the guest rooms some years ago 
but it threw out all the atmosphere recalled mike gallagher of 
darwin australia who first stayed at raffles in 1968 
this is a trip down nostalgia lane for me gallagher said as 
he sipped a 9 singapore sling in the long bar where some of the 
atmosphere is provided by sparrows that flit in through the verandas

the government has promised to protect 
chilean fruit from further contamination and is blaming terrorists 
and communists for a cyanide scare that threatens one of the 
countrys most lucrative exports 
the us food and drug administration on monday warned consumers 
not to eat any fruit imported from chile after traces of cyanide 
were found in chilean seedless red grapes in philadelphia 
the cyanide was discovered after an anonymous threat to poison 
chilean fruit was telephoned to the us embassy in santiago on 
march 2 
news reports in japan said today the japanese embassy in santiago 
had received a similar call warning of cyanide poisoning the 
reports said japan will halt chilean fruit imports 
chiles interior minister carlos caceres went on national radio 
and television monday night and blamed terrorism supported by 
international communism which does not hesitate in damaging not only 
our economic interests but also our social and moral interests 
chile has been under rightwing military rule since september 
1973 when the armed forced ousted the elected government of marxist 
president salvador allende the coup was led by gen augusto 
pinochet the current president 
despite the cyanide scare caceres said chile will continue to 
be a dependable supplier to the international fruit market 
security has been reinforced throughout the fruitexporting 
process from the crop to the port of destiny he said 
caceres said an investigation conducted after the anonymous 
caller said some export fruits would be laced with poison had 
uncovered no problem 
we have now come from the anonymous threat to the concrete 
damage he added 
four days after the poisoning threat was made the fda said the 
call was almost certainly a hoax but that it would continue to 
examine samples of chilean fruit 
after later confirming cyanide in the philadelphia samples the 
fda urged that all chilean fruit be removed from us markets and 
that shipments of chilean fruits which had not yet been distributed 
should be held for testing 
this may be an isolated incident but we can hardly take that 
chance fda commissioner frank young said monday 
hours later canadian officials urged stores in canada to remove 
all chilean produce 
health minister perrin beatty asked stores to remove chilean 
produce from their shelves and advised canadians to throw away any 
fruit and vegetables they know came from chile or think may have 
come from there 
joe pusateri owner of pusateris supermarket in downtown 
toronto said if he takes chilean produce off his shelves he wont 
have anything left to sell 
all my grapes peaches nectarines and apples come from 
chile pusateri said if theyre no good what am i going to do 
throw them in the garbage 
all chilean fruit imported into canada passes through the united 
states 
caceres said government supervisors have been placed at every 
stage of chiles fruitexporting process and the government is 
working in cooperation with private exporters 
he also said technicians from the agriculture ministry and other 
agencies conducted tests monday on a variety of fruits ready for 
export and found nothing wrong 
caceres said the government is doing everything possible to 
limit this unprecedented damage to the nation that has affected 
thousands of chilean families 
chiles fruit exports have been booming in recent years and it 
has now become the leading importer of fresh fruit to north america 
during the northern hemispheres winter 
central bank figures showed in 1988 that those exports reached 
5841 million more than 25 percent of countrys trade surpus for 
last year 
chiles main fruit exports are grapes melons apples and 
peaches imports of chilean apples to the united states went from 
16258 tons in 1983 to 47322 tons in 1987

israeli foreign minister moshe arens accusing 
the palestine liberation organization of the worst atrocities 
weve ever seen since world war ii said today his government 
shares the us desire for peace in the middle east but must cope 
with dangerous radicalism 
arens who is to meet today with members of the senate foreign 
relations committee said on cbs this morning that the plo is 
trying to impose itself in the area and is scaring king hussein of 
jordan away from the peace table 
but he said on nbcs today show that a suggestion by 
secretary of state james a baker iii that israel and the plo 
consider reciprocal gestures to reduce tensions on the west bank and 
in gaza is something that needs to be investigated 
arens said israel was in the midst of selecting areas in the 
occupied territories where troops could be reduced i think we 
will see and i can report back to you as to whether the results 
are positive or not he said 
on monday arens told president bush and baker that us talks 
with the plo would not contribute to peacemaking efforts in the 
middle east 
he said on the cbs show today that the plo was an umbrella 
organization for 10 to 12 different terrorist groups theyve 
carried out the worst atrocities weve ever seen since world war 
ii arens said they are trying to impose themselves on the 
area they are scaring hussein away from the peace table they tried 
to overthrow his regimein september of 1970 theyre carrying out 
terrorist activities 
arens added this kind of violence will not be conducive to the 
peace process at all 
arens called attention to the bombing last week in san diego of 
the car driven by the wife of capt will rogers who commands the 
guided missile frigate vincennes which accidentally shot down an 
iranian jetliner in the persian gulf 
youve seen the gutted car of the skipper of the vincennes 
arens said on nbc we see that on israeli television every day 
weve had 1500 cases like that this past year people burned alive 
dealing with that kind of terrorism is not an easy thing and i 
dont know that anybody really has a prescription on how to do it 
i think the important thing is to demonstrate that this kind of 
violence is not going to pay off arens said 
but the bush administration intends to push ahead in dealing with 
the plo and is making plans for a sixth session with a plo 
representative next week in tunisia 
the talks were opened in december over israels objections since 
then palestinian guerrillas have clashed several times with israeli 
soldiers in southern lebanon while criticizing the plo secretary 
of state james a baker iii has concluded the attacks do not 
constitute terrorism 
arens found himself in basic agreement with president bush and 
baker that there is an urgent need for peacemaking in the middle 
east 
arens said they had also concluded that king hussein of jordan 
was the key element in the process and a way must be found to 
get him involved 
but arens told israeli reporters after the talks on monday that 
he made the point the plo was still engaged in terrorism on three 
levels 
he said yasser arafats organization had sent guerrillas on 
several infiltration raids called for violence on the israeliheld 
west bank and in gaza and threatened palestinian arabs who 
disagreed with the plo 
there is a sense of urgency here and even more so in israel 
arens said of the need for a mideast settlement i told the 
secretary and the president that since we are confronted with this 
difficulty in promoting peace because so many elements are not 
interested in peace it is very important we work together 
a senior us official said meanwhile that baker told arens he 
considered the situation in the territories untenable and wanted 
israel to suggest ways to reduce tensions with the predominantly 
palestinian arab population 
the object is to calm the environment not as an end in itself 
but to create conditions that will allow direct talks said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza have been in 
rebellion against israeli control for 15 months amid the violence 
396 arabs and 17 israelis have died 
we certainly want to reduce tension arens told reporters at 
the state department he added its not easy to do that 
considering the violence in the area at the present time 
however arens also said i think we will find common ground on 
how to do this 
we didnt arrive at any finalized or defined positions arens 
said i think it is probably premature to expect that at this 
point 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said the 
administration was seeking new ideas to advance the peace 
process 
president bush emphasized that the united states does not want 
to miss an opportunity for peace in the middle east and still 
believes in direct talks as the best path to peace fitzwater said 
in a statement 
baker said he was seeking various reinforcing and reciprocal 
steps which might be taken to defuse the tension there on the west 
bank and gaza he was not specific but even before arens arrival 
on sunday published reports said they included release of 
palestinian prisoners and a general easing of israeli control 
next week robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia 
is expected to ask the palestine liberation organization to block 
guerrillas from trying to infiltrate israel

christian soldiers and moslem militiamen 
turned the lebanese capital into a battlefield today with fierce 
shelling that shattered neighborhoods and paralyzed the port and 
airport police said 33 people died and 93 were injured 
all the casualties were civilians except three soldiers killed 
and three wounded 
the duels caught beirut at the peak of the morning rush hour and 
raged past midday cars burned in the raindrenched streets 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
said most casualties occurred in moslem west beirut it was the 
first time in nearly a week of fighting that residential 
neighborhoods have come under sustained artillery bombardment 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet in 
lebanons dual government called for a speedy end to this 
shameful massacre this new cycle of mad violence 
todays casualities raised the overall toll in the latest 
violence to 39 dead and 125 injured by police count 
the new round of fighting in the 14year civil war began 
wednesday after the army commander gen michel aoun who also heads 
the christian cabinet began enforcing an air and sea blockade aimed 
at illegal harbors operated by moslem and christian militias 
the militias use the ports to bring in arms supplies and 
imported goods sold in the areas they control 
the christian cabinet said shells and rockets from the moslem 
side were falling around the defense ministry in suburban yarze 
northeast of beirut and around the hilltop presidential palace in 
neighboring baabda 
clouds of black smoke billowed over the capital as hornhonking 
motorists raced out of stricken neighborhoods and gunmen shot in the 
air to clear paths for ambulances 
schools sent students home and shopkeepers lowered their shutters 
throughout the capital radio stations broadcast warnings to the 
public to remain indoors 
its moronic said english teacher fatima haidar as she 
closed her secondary school in west beiruts verdun neighborhood 
the thunder of shellfire echoing across the city they are the 
gardeners of violence 
police said several mortar shells and rockets landed at 
christiancontrolled beirut port and the harbor of jounieh in 
lebanons christian enclave about 12 miles north of the capital 
the bombardment of jounieh appeared aimed at disrupting the main 
shipping lane linking lebanons christian heartland with the outside 
world 
police said shells also crashed around beiruts international 
airport which was reopened to civil aviation on monday after a 
twoday shutdown 
middle east airlines lebanons national carrier said today it 
had suspended flights to and from the nations only official air 
transport facility until further notice because of the current 
security deterioration 
in one west beirut neighborhood a howitzer salvo landed on a 
crowded street setting at least seven cars on fire rescuers could 
be seen pulling a charred body from one car 
aouns headquarters accused syrian troops stationed in west and 
south beirut and neighboring hills of starting the duel 
beirut port is being shelled for a third day the bombardment 
has spread to hit jounieh as well as residential districts despite 
repeated warnings to stop playing with fire he said in a 
communique 
warnings also were served to avoid being trapped in the 
intrigues of the syrian occupation to push the lebanese into 
fighting each other anew it said 
we have information that the syrian occupiers will escalate the 
bombardment to engulf all sectors and residential neighborhoods 
therefore we ask schools to close and people to remain indoors 
there was no response from the command of the 12000 syrian 
troops stationed in beiruts moslem sector or from syrianallied 
druse and shiite moslem militias

the fbi seems to be backing off the theory 
that the bombing of a navy captains van was internationally 
directed terrorism because the device was a crude pipe bomb us 
sen pete wilson says 
no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing friday of the 
van driven by sharon rogers the wife of uss vincennes capt will 
rogers iii 
but because rogers ordered the mistaken downing of an iranian 
passenger jet in july fbi officials said he is receiving protection 
as a potential target of terrorists 
it is their belief a sophisticated terrorist one who is 
trained in the use of explosives for car bombings would have done a 
better job and that mrs rogers would not have escaped wilson 
said monday 
it is either someone acting independently on their own which 
i suspect to be the case or it was conceivable that it was an act 
of statesponsored terrorism but most of the indications point to 
the former 
however new york newsday reported today that federal sources in 
washington said the cia is providing the fbi with intelligence in 
the case because the cia is forbidden by law from gathering 
intelligence within the united states the report indicated 
continuing suspicion of foreign involvement 
wilson a california republican said his information was based 
primarily on news reports and a conversation with the rogerses the 
couple remain in hiding under the protection of naval investigative 
service agents 
pentagon sources speaking on condition of anonymity noted 
monday that buck revell a top fbi official warned of the potential 
terrorist threat posed by iranian students in the united states 
while testifying to congress recently 
revell cited the san diego region as one area with a high number 
of iranian students but the sources cautioned against drawing the 
inference that students were behind the incident 
while the fbi began examining debris from the explosion the 
agency would not comment publicly on the investigation but 
newspapers quoted federal sources they did not identify regarding 
theories investigators are discussing 
although investigators are still treating the bombing as possible 
terrorism it may have been carried out by disgruntled sailors from 
rogers ship or one or more iranians acting on their own an fbi 
official told the los angeles times 
not any of this is being ruled out he said 
the bomb detonated as mrs rogers drove to work alone she 
escaped uninjured moments before the van caught fire and burned 
both the los angeles times and the new york times quoted sources 
as saying the bomb may have been a heatsensitive device 
a small piece of light wood such as balsa could have been placed 
between the bomb and the vans undercarriage so that when the engine 
got hot it would ignite the wood and detonate the device the los 
angeles times said 
no sign of a detonating device was found among pipe bomb 
fragments recovered the newspapers source said that contributes to 
the theory 
he and others also noted that the bomb detonated while mrs 
rogers was stopped at a traffic light 
most heat comes from an automobile transmission when the car 
is stopped and waiting in traffic so this theory makes sense 
another official said

teachers from the nations secondlargest 
school district have authorized a summer strike that could stall the 
release of final grades and prevent some students from graduating 
union leaders say 
the vote by the united teachers of los angeles taken last week 
and handcounted was 16264 in favor to 1909 against utla 
president wayne johnson said monday th union represents 22000 of 
the districts 32000 teachers 
the teachers will continue negotiations but the odds are very 
high there will be a nasty bitter strike as early as june 
johnson said

demanded a twoyear wage increase of 21 percent board president 
roberta weintraub said the district had made its final offer a 20 
percent raise over three years 
the teachers average salary is 36600 
a walkout near the end of the school year could tie up grades for 
the districts 594000 students prevent some seniors from 
graduating and affect students applying to colleges said 
superintendent leonard britton 
the teachers are barred by law from striking without a previous 
factfinding period in which a neutral panel reviews the disputed

overlapping radio messages between a 
pilot and air traffic controllers probably led to a jet crash in the 
azores that killed 144 people government investigators said today 
the ministry of public works transport and communications said 
that because of the overlapping conversations the pilot apparently 
descended to 2000 feet when he should have remained at 3000 feet 
the americanchartered boeing 707 filled with italian tourists 
on their way to the caribbean slammed into a fogcovered mountain 
on the azores island of santa maria on feb 8 all on board died 
according to the ministry statement the control tower authorized 
the pilot to descend to 3000 feet it then informed the pilot which 
runway to use and asked him to renew contact when the plane was at 
3000 feet 
at the same time the control tower was relaying its second 
message the pilot was announcing plans to drop to 2000 feet 
neither side heard the others message the ministry concluded 
the plane hit in a zone where flying is not permitted below 
an altitude of 3000 feet the report said 
the commission also said controllers gave the jets crew an 
atmospheric pressure reading of 1027 millibars instead of the 
correct 11087 millibars the difference in pressure readings would 
mean the jets altimeters told the pilot he was 240 feet above his 
actual position 
the plane owned by independent air corp of smyrna tenn 
crashed into 1936 foot pico alto 
according to the statement the commission found no evidence of 
mechanical or technical failure of the plane or its equipment the 
commissions report also ruled out sabotage or other criminal 
action the statement said

president bush today called homelessness an 
affront to the american dream and said he wants to help get 
ragged and pathetic figures off the streets of the nations 
capital and urban america 
addressing a legislative conference of the independent insurance 
agents of america bush talked of riding in his limousine along the 
ellipse a park just off the white house grounds and seeing people 
on the heating grates 
its a national shame the president said in a speech that 
touched on initiatives he proposed to a joint session of congress on 
feb 9 
bush also vowed anew to work shouldertoshoulder with drug 
czar william bennett to mount a new attack on drug abuse as bennett 
prepared to meet with city officials in washington on the capitals 
surging drugrelated murder rate 
bush told his audience at a downtown hotel that he thought the 
problem of drugs in schools and on the streets would show up as the 
top issue if i could talk to each one of you in a family setting 
in a 193page report to congress summarizing his fiscal 1990 
budget proposals bush said his administration was committed to 
addressing forcefully the tragedy of homelessness through public and 
private action 
the homeless face difficult and sometimes seemingly 
overwhelming obstacles in getting back on their feet he said in 
that message 
city officials estimate there are some 8000 to 10000 homeless 
in washington although activists for the homeless have said they 
believe the figure ranges to 15000 
nationally experts agree there are no reliable figures although 
research shows that the level of homelessness can range from 300000 
to 600000 on any given night 
in his speech today bush said homelessness affects a small 
proportion of americans but concerns us all 
you look out the window of the white house and see the 
ragged and pathetic figures huddled over the steam grates of the 
ellipse its an affront to the american dream he said 
in his spending blueprint for the budget year beginning oct 1 
bush proposed spending 644 million to carry out the aims of the 
mckinney act which created a program to find housing for the 
homeless he also called for a new 50 million program designed to 
assist volunteers and community organizations working with the 
homeless

a pharmaceutical company today said drugresistant 
strains of the aids virus have been found in patients undergoing 
longterm treatment with the firms azt drug 
wellcome plc was confirming a report in todays wall street 
journal the newspaper said the finding could lead some doctors to 
use the wellcome drug more selectively or in combination with other 
drugs for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
azt is the only drug approved by the us food and drug 
administration for treatment of aids 
wellcome said the resistant viral strains were found in 
laboratory analyses of samples taken from aids patients showing 
severe symptoms of the deadly disease there were no significant 
changes in the condition of these patients at the time the 
drugresistant viral strains were observed it said 
it said the information does not require alterations in patient 
therapy or the conduct of continuing clinical trials but stressed 
that the responsibility for treating those infected the aids virus 
lies with the physician 
the british pharmaceuticals company said reviews of the data by 
its own scientists and by a panel of aids experts have been 
submitted for publication in the us journal science 
wellcome shares fell 36 cents to 784 with the announcement 
they then recovered to 813 
jonathan de pass a pharmaceutical analyst at barclays de zoete 
wedd ltd said the discovery of drugresistant hiv strains was no 
major surprise as the aids virus is known to be prone to rapid 
mutations 
de pass also said he did not expect the discovery to have a major 
impact on azt sales because of the drugs known toxic sideeffects 
doctors already were expected to prescribe azt in progressively 
lower doses and in combination with other drugs he said 
didier cowling an analyst at nomura research institute said the 
major danger to azt sales could come if the fda were to block any 
application by wellcome to use azt as a treatment for socalled 
asymptomatic carriers of hiv those who do not yet show any 
symptoms of the aids disease 
wellcome is testing the possible benefits of azt on asymptomatic 
patients and cowling expects the first results of these tests to be 
available by the end of this year 
aids is caused by the hiv virus which damages the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

millions of commuters were stranded 
nationwide today as public transportation shut down at the start of 
a 48hour general strike called by leftist labor groups 
however many brazilians ignored the strike call and went to work 
the subway in sao paulo the nations largest city with 10 
million people operated normally as did a small number of 
privately owned buses but the citys public bus fleet was idled 
in greater sao paulo with a population of 15 million more than 
70 percent of the 2 million factory workers showed up at their jobs 
according to the federation of industries of sao paulo state 
the citys suburbs are home to brazils foreignowned auto plants 
including general motors ford and volkswagen and a center of 
strike organization 
international and domestic airlines flew on normal schedules and 
supermarkets gas stations small shops and corner cafes opened 
brazils two largest labor movements the radical left central 
workers union and the more moderate general workers central called 
the strike to protest president jose sarneys antiinflation policy 
which has frozen workers pay since january 
i would say we can consider the strike a success i am sure 
that as the day progresses the strike will grow sergio dos santos 
said in a telephone interview early today from strike headquarters 
in sao paulo 
some violence was reported in sao paulo rockthrowers damaged 
about 30 buses and one person was arrested police said 
in rio de janeiro the nations secondlargest city strikers 
threw stones and punctured tires of some privately owned buses that 
attempted to operate cityowned buses did not run 
police with billy clubs beat and detained several people accused 
of trying to loot stores in caxias on the northern outskirts of rio 
de janeiro 
a photographer of the jornal do brasil newspaper who was taking 
pictures of the beatings was shot in the hand by a policeman 
according to the jornal do brasil radio station which is owned by 
the newspaper 
sarneys centrist government warned it would not allow violence 
and accused the labor groups of trying to seize control of latin 
americas largest country 
we have reliable information that violence against the freedom 
to work is planned justice minister oscar dias correa told the 
nation of 144 million people in a radio and television broadcast 
army troops were posted in rio outside the main downtown station 
of the governmentrun commuter railroad which was shut down the 
trains normally carry about 1 million commuters a day 
rios subway was shut down as was the governmentrun commuter 
ferry service across worldfamous guanabara bay 
in brasilia the capital labor minister dorothea werneck kept in 
telephone contact with authorities in brazils 26 states to assess 
the degree of participation in the strike 
the unions that called the strike together claim to represent 35 
million of the nations 60 million workers 
the general strike was brazils third since the nation returned 
to civilian rule in 1985 the first in december 1986 was partly 
successful the second in august 1987 was a failure 
this year the two labor movements have put aside their 
rivalries and we are much better prepared said jair meneguelli 
president of the central workers union 
at issue is a wage freeze that is part of the governments jan 
15 summer plan an austerity package that also includes a price 
freeze and other measures aimed at bringing down 1000 percent 
annual inflation 
the plan brought inflation down from a rate of 287 percent a 
month in december to 36 percent for the first 11 days of february 
the latest period for which government figures are available 
but meneguelli said the wage freeze slashed workers purchasing 
power by up to 49 percent and we want it back more than half of 
brazilian workers earn less than 50 a week 
the government concedes that purchasing power dropped but has 
not given figures 
the sao paulo state federation of industries said in a statement 
that the general strike was aimed exclusively at the destruction 
of the summer plan which despite its errors was the only viable way 
to stop a process of hyperinflation which threatened to lead brazil 
to chaos 
the country is saddled with a 115 billion foreign debt

warnings against disruptions will be 
posted when a church that closed a month ago because of protests by 
parishioners reopens 
three weeks after police were summoned to st michael the 
archangle roman catholic church to oust dissidents protesting the 
transfer of a polish priest the parish corporation voted friday to 
reopen the church edward tulinski said monday 
the church will probably resume masses by sunday which is palm 
sunday said tulinski one of two lay members of the fivemember 
board 
they were eager to reopen the church for the easter holidays 
he said 
on the advice of the corporations lawyer signs will be posted 
threatening the arrest of anyone who attempts to occupy the church 
or undertake any activity not authorized by the rev john bambol 
the pastor tulinski said 
the predominantly polish church has been closed since feb 18 
when church officials called police to end a weeklong sitin by 
about 200 parishioners upset by the transfer of the rev roman 
palaszewski 
the dissidents charged that bambol engineered palaszewskis 
ouster because he was too active in the polish community and they 
questioned bambols commitment to maintaining the churchs polish 
character 
bambol and his supporters have blamed much of the unrest on 
recent immigrants from poland and say they have the backing of 95 
percent of the 1400 families belonging to the parish 
one dissident leader vowed to defy the order against unauthorized 
activities in the church 
ill be the first to get arrested again said henry chmiel 
one of two parshioners arrested when police marched in and ordered 
the dissidents to leave 
a few hours after the dissidents were removed bishop edward egan 
announced that the church was being closed indefinitely on grounds 
that the protest had made it impossible to conduct services in a 
reverential manner 
the protesters have held prayer vigils outside the church each 
sunday since 
monsignor nicholas grieco a spokesman for the bishop said 
palaszewksi will not be returned to the church and bambol will not 
be removed

president pw botha at odds 
with his own party returns from an eightweek convalescence 
wednesday to confront his cabinet ministers after they joined in 
calling for a new head of state 
by late tuesday botha has made no public response to the 
announcement by the national party parliamentary caucus including 
the entire cabinet that it wanted education minister frederik de 
klerk to become president 
botha 73 resigned as party leader feb 2 two weeks after 
suffering a stroke and was succeeded in the post by de klerk 
the caucus has no formal means of forcing botha out of the 
presidency barring evidence of misconduct or incapacity but its 
announcement monday night that it wanted the party leader to be head 
of state was viewed as a blunt message that botha should drop plans 
to stay in office until next year 
the star the countrys largest daily newspaper referred to an 
ominous silence at the presidential office in cape town and 
predicted botha would come out fighting after being cut adrift 
by his party 
the power struggle between de klerk and botha reached a turning 
point sunday when botha arranged an interview with state tv and 
announced he would not call an early election this year 
the next election does not have to be held until march 1990 and 
bothas declaration made without consulting party leaders 
quashed hopes he would retire in the next few months in conjunction 
with an early election 
beeld an afrikaanslanguage johannesburg newspaper loyal to the 
national party said in a biting editorial tuesday there is an 
unavoidable impression that the election is being delayed as long as 
possible to extend the term of the state president as long as 
possible 
de klerk indicated botha should decide for himself whether to 
retire telling reporters there is nothing in the caucus 
decision that says he must step down now 
the argus cape towns afternoon paper said in an editorial that 
botha had two options 
he could take the undisguised hint and step down the 
newspaper said or he could tough it out and cling to his job as 
he is constitutionally entitled to do but he would be presiding 
over a grudging caucus and cabinet and the results of that for 
south africa could be disastrous 
bothas spokesman jack viviers said the president was expected 
to report for work at 8 am wednesday he is to preside over a 
cabinet meeting then go to parliament for presentation of the new 
budget 
botha and his wife elize were to have cabinet members and other 
guests at their home tuesday night to celebrate their 46th wedding 
anniversary 
throughout the national partys 40 years in power the head of 
government had always been party leader after botha quit the party 
post party members suddenly felt free to express simmering 
opposition to his authoritarian style of leadership and to the pace 
he set for racial reform 
during 10 years as head of government botha has moved cautiously 
to remove or amend aspects of apartheid the system of 
racesegregation that gives the white minority economic and 
political control over the black majority but botha has held to the 
underlying apartheid concept of separate racial groups and has used 
emergency powers to quell antiapartheid uprisings in black 
communities 
de klerk 52 is widely seen as more openminded and flexible 
than botha and more in tune with a younger generation of whites who 
favor early and farreaching solutions to south africas social 
problems 
a new man would be forced to do new things said the 
sowetan the countrys largest black daily newspaper urging botha 
to retire

a firefighters union and a furniture 
manaufacturers trade association said tuesday they have agreed to 
support californias strict proposed public furniture fire 
resistance test for adoption in all states 
adoption of the test could raise the manufacturing cost of sofas 
and chairs by 20 percent but save thousands of lives by the end of 
the 1990s said the international association of fire fighters and 
the american furniture manufacturers assocation 
the standard would apply only to furniture used in public areas 
such as hotel lobbies day care centers jails and the like and not 
in hotel rooms or private homes 
we had to crawl before we could walk we want to see the effect 
of this said alfred k whitehead president of the union in 
explaining why the two organizations were limiting the coverage of 
their proposal 
the california standard has been proposed by that states bureau 
of home furnishings but is not in effect there yet however some 
california cities have adopted it locally 
the test calls for placing five sheets of newspaper in a 
specified open steel box on the seat of the item being tested 
igniting the paper and monitoring the test chamber to see that 
temperature rise smoke density carbon monoxide concentration and 
weight loss from the test item do not exceed specified levels for an 
hour and a half 
the aim is to delay the onset of flashover the sudden 
ignition of the entire room and the combustible gases it contains 
given off by the burning item 
furniture passing the test will at a minimum slow the spread 
of fire in these occupancies allowing firefighters to save more of 
the occupants from death or injury whitehead said 
the test is many times more stringent than current industry 
standards for resistance to cigarette ignition which accounts for 
75 percent to 80 percent of furniturerelated fires said les flippo 
of the associations upholstered furniture action council 
no furniture meets it today except for costly specially 
made items said flippo whose association members account for 80 
percent of the industry

former federal budget director bert lance who 
resigned amid controversy over his banking practices says he is the 
victim of an illegal and politically motivated campaign by the 
federal deposit insurance corp 
lance filed his response monday to a lawsuit filed against him 
last month by the fdic in federal court in rome the fdic lawsuit 
seeks 15 million which the agency contends lance owes to a defunct 
tennessee bank 
lance charged that the fdic in the late 1970s commenced a 
policy of selectively leaking to the news media information about 
his personal financial situation such information was 
confidential and its release by the fdic was contrary to law he 
said in his response 
he asked that the lawsuit be dismissed or taken to a jury trial 
and that the fdic be forced to pay his legal fees 
the fdic lawsuit filed feb 8 contended lance and his former 
holding company owed the money because of renewal agreements for 
loans made with united american bank of knoxville tenn 
the tennessee banking commissioner assumed control of united 
american bank six years ago and the fdic later took over various 
uab loans including the lance loans 
the lawsuit listed four notes with principal balances totaling 
1247667 and said lance also owed interest 
lance responded that he is under no obligation to pay the fdic 
anything because he had already repaid the loans he also said the 
fdic failed to deal with him in good faith and said the renewal 
agreements were forced on him by the fdic 
lance once a calhoun banker and georgias transportation 
commissioner became federal budget director after fellow georgian 
jimmy carter was elected president in 1976 lance resigned in 
september 1977 after his banking practices were questioned 
three years ago lance agreed to pay a fine of 50000 and not 
work at any federally insured bank in a settlement resulting from 
charges of bank fraud filed by the federal office of the comptroller 
of the currency

five days before christmas in 1974 
5yearold joanna pierce went to stay with her father for what she 
and her mother thought would be a weekend visit 
instead her father took her to europe where he kept her hidden 
for the next 10 years 
joannas mother gloria yerkovich spent 40000 searching for 
her daughter appeared on network television and argued with 
officials from her hometown of poughkeepsie all the way to 
washington dc 
in the process she founded child find inc an international 
network that has tracked down hundreds of missing children 
yerkovich said she started the organization as a last resort when 
she couldnt break through the legal roadblocks that existed in 
parental abductions and when her loans dried up 
yerkovich and her daughter were reunited in 1984 after the girls 
father franklin pierce agreed to return if a felony charge of 
custodial interference against him was dropped 
he did not want to subject his daughter to a life of running 
any more said david cohen pierces attorney 
the homecoming didnt last long within a week joanna moved to 
florida to live with her father with whom she remains 
but now all three are in federal court in albany where yerkovich 
sued pierce for 57 million for abducting their daughter 
yerkovich hopes the lawsuit will help mother and daughter start 
talking again said her lawyer nick lyman since 1974 she has 
never had an open channel of communication with her daughter 
pierce and yerkovich were never married but he had obtained a 
family court order granting him alternate weekend visits with his 
child joanna vanished during the first courtordered overnight 
visit 
pierce now 70 has admitted he took joanna but said he did so 
to save her a life of torment with her mother and stepfather 
raymond yerkovich an elementary school principal from kingston whom 
gloria married in 1973 
joanna testifying on behalf of her father has said that her 
mother struck her repeatedly and that her stepfather fondled her 
the yerkoviches have refused to respond to the charges 
authorities say parental abduction has increased in proportion 
with the escalating rate of divorce in the united states 
but yerkovich said that during her search for her daughter she 
was horrified to learn that while there was a national computer 
network for stolen cars there was none for missing children 
embittered and broke she began laying the groundwork for child find 
the group compiled a pictorial directory of missing children for 
distribution to schools and established a tollfree number for 
people who spotted children in the directory 
four years later the group became the target of a state 
investigation into allegations of financial irregularities and 
taking kickbacks from investigators the investigation found no 
evidence to support charges of serious wrongdoing but the agency 
agreed to change promotional material and practices and offer 
refunds 
while the group helped find hundreds of missing children joanna 
was not one of them 
yerkovich said pierce a former dow chemical co chemist who 
later started his own business was wealthy and able to move himself 
and his daughter around easily 
during testimony last week yerkovich burst into tears when she 
recalled the evening of dec 20 1974 the last day she saw joanna 
for 10 years 
i cried and sometimes i screamed i would turn on the shower 
and hope the water would drown out my screams i would scream in the 
car when no one could hear me she said 
but joanna now 20 testified that her stepfather drank a lot and 
that there was a lot of violence between her mother and stepfather 
she said she was struck almost daily and once was knocked 
unconscious after being hurled against a wall 
she also claimed her stepfather fondled her he put his hands 
all over my body i despised him she said 
joanna described an open and caring relationship with her father 
she said she never missed her mother 
yerkovich contends in her suit that joanna was brainwashed by her 
father and that he showed little interest in her until the abduction 
lyman said hell show that franklin pierce took a loving girl 
and turned her into a monster against her mother 
i saw the statements of two doctors lyman said including 
one hired by her father which show she was clearly not abused her 
life as she knows it is a lie 
joanna tearfully disputed that 
i dont want to remember but you remember things she said

a guide dog accompanied a blind 
couple into a hospital delivery room but got sick twice during the 
womans labor and had to leave the room 
but rick oakes and his wife chantal said they wouldnt have 
wanted their dog to miss the birth of their daughter whitney leanne 
oakes 
i like that dog better than some people i know mrs oakes 
said monday at their home in this vancouver suburb hes just like 
part of the family 
oakes said the presence of bryor a 3yearold golden retriever 
allowed him to leave for meals and an occasional cigarette during 
the 24 hours his wife was in labor at vancouvers grace hospital on 
march 8 
he said he also wanted to make a point after having had his right 
to have bryor with him challenged by everyone from taxi drivers to 
restaurant owners 
i thought it would be a golden opportunity to let people know 
guide dogs can go anywhere he said 
except for two times when he had to leave the delivery room to 
throw up bryor didnt create problems when attention focused on 
the baby after delivery however the dog picked up a towel and 
started dragging it around the room to attract attention to himself 
thats understandable since everyone from doctors to orderlies 
had been dropping by to give him a scratch under the collar mrs 
oakes said 
her obstetrician barry sanders had no qualms about the dog 
it was an unusual request he said but the dog is great 
he would never bother anybody

advocates for the blind clashed with federal 
regulators and aviation industry officials tuesday over whether its 
safe to allow blind people to sit next to emergency exit doors on 
airplanes 
in a crash involving a fire it is essential to get an evacuation 
started immediately and any delay can be fatal said anthony j 
broderick associate administrator of the federal aviation 
administration 
thus the faa has prepared rules that would ban seating any 
disabled individual next to emergency exits broderick told the 
aviation subcommittee of the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee the regulation would also apply to 
pregnant women small children and others such as frail elderly who 
might have difficulties with the emergency exit door 
during an evacuation anything which slows the opening of doors 
or impedes the start of passengers getting off the plane increases 
the likelihood of fatalities broderick said 
but kenneth jernigan executive director of the national 
federation for the blind contested brodericks contention that 
blind passengers would slow down the flow of people exiting from a 
plane 
the truth is that we are being made victims of a misdirected 
and misapplied federal policy that has irrationally gone wild 
said jernigan 
in cases where a cabin was filled with smoke or the lights had 
failed a blind person could be more effective than a sighted one at 
getting a door open and helping people leave jernigan said 
as far as i have been able to determine there is not a case on 
record in which a blind person has been involved in the blocking of 
an exit or the slowing of traffic in an emergency he said 
nonetheless airlines discriminate against the blind he said 
and the proposed regulation would just make that worse 
dan frye a blind student told the subcommittee of a case in 
which a flight was canceled because he declined to move from a seat 
in the row leading to an emergency door and said he was threatened 
with arrest and publicly humiliated 
since there is no way to accurately determine what disabilities 
any individual may have frye suggested that airlines simply remove 
the seats from aisles leading to emergency exits 
on the other side however was the association of flight 
attendants 
association president susan bianchisand said in prepared 
testimony that the proposed rules are long overdue 
emergency doors do not operate the same as normal doors the 
instructions are often written on them and opening the door without 
being able to check outside could allow a fire to enter the cabin 
she warned 
in addition people exiting a plane need to be able to determine 
whether the emergency slide has been properly deployed and if there 
is water or land or even spilled fuel below 
in addition she pointed out that pulling the wrong handle can 
detach the emergency chute rather than deploying it 
restrictions on who can sit next to the emergency exit need to 
apply to anyone why may not be able to lead an evacuation whether 
blind or someone returning from a skiing vacation on crutches she 
said 
james e landry senior vice president of the air transport 
association also agreed with the proposed faa rules 
while it may be true that certain blind persons will react 
better than certain sighted persons in an emergency situation in a 
darkened cabin interior there is no test by which these qualities 
could be discerned by airline employees he said in prepared 
remarks 
that being the case he said a reasonable precautionary rule 
applied on a class basis to protect the public safety is prudent 
and sensible

birth defects among birds in the great lakes 
region have increased over the past two decades according to 
research released tuesday by the sierra club 
the environmental organization said researchers found toxic 
chemicals causing the defects are in the food chain 
a 198688 survey of water bird eggs in the upper great lakes 
region found deformities in caspian terns occurring 31 times more 
frequently than in the late 1960s and early 1970s said james p 
ludwig a consulting ecologist from bay city mich 
among deformities found in ludwigs research were malformed hips 
club feet eye abnormalities and body organs attached outside the 
birds at birth 
even low levels of contamination produced effects in the great 
lakes food chain ludwig said 
in a broad sense these chemicals are eliminating the diversity 
in the great lakes ludwig said we have a few species but the 
elegance is gone 
his research included birds nesting in highly contaminated areas 
such as saginaw bay in eastern michigan 
many contaminants are blown into the lakes from many hundreds of 
miles away an ecologist said in describing research last year on 
isle royal mich an island in lake superior 
deborah swackhammer an ecologist with the university of 
minnesota studied fish in siskiwit lake on the island and found 
concentrations of the toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyl 
the pcb could only have reached the lake from the air since the 
lakes level is above that of the surrounding lake superior she 
said 
not only is every fish in the great lakes contaminated by 
chemicals to some extent but anything that consumes those fish is 
also contaminated to some extent including people she said 
the research was released as part of the annual great lakes 
lobbying project in washington by the sierra club 
at a news conference the organization to demonstrate the 
effects of pollution showed a live cormorant with a twisted beak 
the bird which was found on naubinway island mich in northern 
lake michigan may eventually be placed in a bay city petting zoo

michael dukakis passionless manner hurt him as 
a white house contender and might well have cramped his presidency 
if he had won former democratic rival paul simon says in a new 
book the first by a candidate looking back on the 1988 race 
he enjoys campaigning less than some candidates do simon 
writes of the massachusetts governor his great weakness as a 
candidate and perhaps would have been as a president is that he 
does not convey passion 
the illinois senators comments are in winners and losers a 
combination memoir and critique that he described in a recent 
interview as a candid observation of the candidates in the race 
for example sen albert gore jr had a brashness of style 
simon suggests in the book bruce babbitt became a media darling by 
committing political suicide with a taxraising proposal 
dukakis was too remote 
on the other hand the illinois senator gives dukakis much higher 
marks than himself for strategy and dealing with public perceptions 
at the outset of the battle for the democratic nomination 
simon had hoped to win the iowa caucuses but finished second to 
missouri rep richard gephardt and now blames himself for not acting 
more pleased at the time 
my comments after the iowa race should have reflected that 
upbeat mood of the electorate more than they did he wrote we 
had no plans to look cheerful the dukakis team had planned to look 
excited about coming in third and pulled it off 
simon faults himself for other tactical errors too and for 
failing to build his campaign around a central theme that would have 
been easily accessible to voters but he also says he was hit by bad 
luck at a crucial point 
he says he had a substantial lead in precaucus iowa polls before 
gary hart resumed his campaign that had been scrapped amid reports 
about an affair 
when hart got back in the roof fell in simon writes 
polls taken all over the nation immediately showed him in first 
place taking the spotlight from simon though hart did not mount a 
campaign in iowa itself 
in a recent interview simon said gary hart didnt get back in 
with the purpose of hurting paul simon the end result was that he 
did 
the book is the 12th by simon a onetime newspaper publisher 
but the first intended for the mass market past efforts have been 
examinations of issues such as hunger and foreignlanguage education 
my last book was about unemployment in this country and 
theres just not a lot of people who want to read about 
unemployment this has a little more general appeal no question 
about it simon said 
weve had all kinds of people writing about what a campaign is 
like but its a little different when youre sitting in the chair 
of a candidate he said 
simon said he also wanted to reflect about whats right and 
whats wrong about our process 
he characterized the campaign as too long too superficial and 
too expensive and he objected to a proposal for regional primaries 
contending they would make success even more dependent upon money 
although he sent copies of the book to his former rivals simon 
said none has contacted him 
the senator has not read it yet but he hopes to as soon as he 
can get the time said greta creech the deputy press secretary 
for gore 
aides to other excandidates voiced similar comments 
gore was 39 when he announced his candidacy and simon says his 
youth occasionally showed in a brashness of style that time usually 
tempers in successful politicians 
babbitts proposal to increase taxes resulted in his becoming 
the medias favorite candidate simon writes anyone who is 
willing to commit political suicide in public has a ready market 
with political commentators 
but as his failure to rise in the polls became apparent bruce 
became a little desperate simon writes 
simon blames himself for a number of mistakes such as getting 
into the race without advance planning sometimes misusing 
advertising failing to heed his advisers and ignoring offered help 
from volunteers for joseph biden after the senator from delaware 
left the race

retail sales dropped 04 percent in february 
the biggest decline in almost a year as business slowed at car 
dealerships the government reported today 
the commerce department said sales fell to a seasonally adjusted 
1382 billion last month after rising a strong 07 percent in 
january when business was aided by unusually mild winter weather 
the overall rate was held back by a 17 percent drop in 
automotive sales last month the second straight decline in that 
category car sales had dropped 17 percent in january and been 
virtually unchanged in december 
excluding autos which account for almost onefourth of the 
retail total sales edged down 01 percent last month after rising a 
robust 14 percent in january 
the size of februarys overall drop in sales last was matched by 
a 04 percent drop in april 1988 the last time there was a bigger 
drop was in october 1987 when sales plunged 09 percent 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
bottom line is this it probably helps offset inflationary fears 
theres still only one months figures january was up so theres 
no trend here the economy is still sound 
retail spending which accounts for about onethird of the gross 
national product is closely watched as a barometer of economic 
health 
many analysts expect a slowdown in consumer spending this year as 
rising interest rates start to take their toll although few 
economists had anticipated a drop in sales for february the federal 
reserve board for a year has been nudging interest rates upward in 
an effort to dampen economic growth and thus restrain inflation 
in the key category of department and other general merchandise 
stores sales fell 08 percent to a seasonally adjusted 103 
billion last month following a 2 percent rise in january 
in a separate report earlier this month the nations largest 
retailers had reported strong sales for february from yearearlier 
levels spurred by renewed demand for womens apparel and other 
consumer and household goods 
clothing stores did report a 05 percent increase in february 
sales from the previous month 
among the categories to post big declines in retail sales last 
month were building and hardware stores down 25 percent and 
furniture and home furnishing stores down 07 percent 
the strongest sales were recorded in the category of gasoline 
stations where business was up 08 percent 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last at 
least three years plunged 13 percent last month after an 03 
percent decline in january the drops were partly of a reflection of 
the slide in auto sales 
the decline in the durable goods sector was the biggest since a 
25 percent drop in october 1987 
sales of nondurable goods edged up 01 percent last month after 
rising 14 percent in january 
in other categorties retail sales rose 01 percent at grocery 
and other food stores and at restaurants and bars and 03 percent 
at drug stores

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane testified today that a letter he sent congress about 
contra support probably would have come out differently had it 
not been written the day before he tried to commit suicide 
mcfarlane responded angrily to john keker a prosecutor at oliver 
norths irancontra trial when questioned today about the feb 8 
1987 letter to thenhouse intelligence committee chairman lee 
hamilton 
keker said the letter is just complete nonsense isnt it 
mcfarlane cited his state of mind the day before i tried to 
take my life and said the letter probably would have come out 
differently if he had tried to parse every last dime 
the letter said a foreign national offered to contribute money to 
the contras in a may 1984 meeting with mcfarlane and that the amount 
donated was 5 million or less in fact the offer came from the 
government of saudi arabia through its ambassador and the country 
donated 32 million to the contras starting in 1984 
the letter said the money was from his the foreign nationals 
own wealth and not from any government 
when keker pointed out that that statement was false mcfarlane 
responded that is a gloss but that is what he the saudi 
ambassador told me 
in my own state of mind i was acknowledging my participation 
in a thirdcountry donation i knew darn well it was something about 
a million dollars a month if i had toted up the full amount 
mcfarlane said he added that i am dead wrong in the letter 
about the amount 
the letter by mcfarlane followed his testimony to the house 
intelligence committee in december 1986 in which he said he was 
unfamiliar with any saudi contribution 
his 1986 testimony was one of four misdemeanors to which 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to withholding information from congress in 
the irancontra affair 
mcfarlane testified about the events of november 1986 when 
details of the iran initiative were emerging and the diversion of 
funds to the contras was discovered 
at the request of thennational security adviser john poindexter 
mcfarlane on the night of nov 18 1986 went to norths office 
where the national security council aide reported that government 
lawyers believed there might be a problem with a november 1985 
shipment of 18 hawk antiaircraft missiles from israel to iran 
the possible problem concerned whether or not the involvement 
of the cia was appropriate or properly executed he said the 
cia had helped arrange the shipment 
mcfarlane testified that north told him that he and i hadnt 
learned of this shipment until later on he wasnt certain about 
it and that at the time us officials believed the material being 
shipped was oil drilling equipment 
mcfarlane said that by 1986 i had no clear recollection of 
when he had learned of the shipment which he had been told about in 
november 1985 in geneva mcfarlane had informed president reagan and 
secretary of state george shultz of the plans for the hawk shipment 
acting on norths comments mcfarlane changed the chronology by 
taking out a reference to the 1985 shipment being hawk missiles 
replacing it with a general mention of other transfers of 
unspecified equipment mcfarlane said the change succeeded as an 
effort not to contradict the truth which he said he wasnt 
certain of at the time 
one of the accusations against north is that he obstructed 
congress by saying in the final version of the chronology that no 
one in the us government learned before january 1986 that hawk 
missiles had been shipped to iran in november 1985 
the former national security adviser also testified that he went 
into a meeting at poindexters office as it was breaking up the next 
morning and that someone made the comment that there was no problem 
in connection with the iran initiative 
just popping off i said i believe you have a problem with 
the use of iran money for the contras recalled mcfarlane who 
had been told of the diversion by north the previous may poindexter 
and north returned minutes later and admonished mcfarlane that one 
of the participants in the meeting was unaware of the diversion he 
testified 
mcfarlane also testified that on a car ride to the white house on 
nov 21 north said were going to have a shredding party to 
relieve any fears i had about becoming involved in a political 
brouhaha with congress over the iran initiative 
mcfarlane agreed with keker that north was referring to 
probably hundreds of documents including memos to mcfarlane 
spelling out norths involvement in the contra aid efforts during a 
congressional ban on military aid to the guerrillas 
i said dont worry about anything mcfarlane recalled 
tell it like it is and everything will be okay 
on crossexamination mcfarlane agreed with north lawyer brendan 
sullivan that north was the hardestworking person he had ever 
encountered and that you would want him in your life raft 
mcfarlane got two sixmonth extensions from the marine corps for 
north to remain at the national security council

for 23 years from a site high above waimea 
canyon ron chen has helped nasa monitor americas manned 
spaceflights 
but this week he and about 70 coworkers are tracking the mission 
that will cost them their jobs 
the kokee tracking station is scheduled to close at the end of 
the fiscal year on sept 30 it is one of six nasa ground stations 
being put out of business at a savings of 36 million a year by 
mondays successful launching from the shuttle discovery of the 
latest tracking data and relay satellite tdrs for short 
the kicker is that we are helping to put it tdrs in 
position said chen who as telemetry supervisor processes all the 
information coming down from the shuttle 
the satellite joins one fully functioning and one backup tdrs in 
orbit 22300 miles above the earth to complete a network that relays 
radio communications between shuttles and the earth during 85 
percent of each orbit 
using ground stations radio contact is possible only when the 
shuttle is roughly above each station a total of about 15 percent 
of each orbit 
chen thinks closing the station is a mistake because of the 
chance one of the new satellites could fail nasa plans to launch a 
fourth tdrs as further backup late in 1990 
weve known for a long time that this place would be closing 
its no surprise said station manager dan funamura we were 
supposed to have closed 10 years ago 
many of the employees have been at kokee for 20 years or more and 
have established roots here 
most have been offered positions by bendix field engineering co 
which operates the station for nasa but most want to remain on 
kauai funamura said 
sometimes i want to go with the company other times i want to 
stay here said les sueyasu operations supervisor who is the 
stations voice in communications with nasa headquarters in 
houston and the goddard space flight center in maryland 
right now im going to stay here said sueyasu a native of 
kauai who has been at kokee since 1964 
funamura a kauai native who has been at the station since it 
opened in 1960 also plans to stay 
but job opportunities on the island for skilled technicians are 
limited he said 
its going to be strange going out into the streets looking for 
a job said ed edwards computer systems supervisor who has been 
at the station since it opened i am real attached to the place 
and am married to a local girl so my roots are here 
the station which has supported every us manned space flight 
except the suborbital mercury flights is on a 25acre site at an 
elevation of 4200 feet in kokee state park overlooking waimea 
canyon the canyon is a popular attraction on the west side of kauai 
island about 100 miles northwest of honolulu 
most of the site will be returned to the state a small section 
will be turned over to the navy which has radar and telemetry 
facilities there 
chen points with pride to several important contributions the 
station has made to the manned space flights 
we were the first station to detect the electrical problem 
which caused the thrusters to keep firing during the gemini 8 
mission he said the problem cut short the march 1966 mission 
kokee also is one of only three tracking stations capable of 
processing live television from the shuttles and usually is the 
first to receive video from space chen said 
we remote it to houston which makes it available to the 
networks he said 
john glenns first manned orbital flight in february 1966 is the 
most memorable space mission for funamura 
we practiced for weeks and when the actual thing came it was 
tremendous he said 
other stations scheduled for closing because of tdrs are at 
ascension island in the south atlantic santiago chile guam 
dakar senegal and yarragadee australia they employ a total of 
nearly 400 people

a puzzling pressure reading on a 
hydrogen tank forced discoverys astronauts to dim lights and turn 
off computers and other systems to conserve power today and raised 
the possibility of an early return to earth 
mission control emphasized the trouble posed no threat to the 
fiveman crew or its mission but could cut the flight from five to 
four days 
the crew members went about their scientific experiments as usual 
after the poweringdown taking pictures of environmentally 
damaged areas of the earth such as the rain forests of brazil and 
the mexican coastline 
the order came three hours after the crewmen were awakened by the 
raucous shouts of james browns i got you i feel good 
flight director ron dittmore said the hydrogen tank exhibited 
erratic readings 
the tank is one of three that feeds liquid hydrogen to 
discoverys powerproducing fuel cells without it the shuttle 
might not have electrical energy to support a fiveday flight plus 
two days for any contingencies 
flight firector al pennington said he was optimistic the problem 
would be solved right now we plan to land on saturday unless we 
get some engineering data that says we cant use that tank 
pennington said at a news conference 
if the tank cant be fixed the shuttle probably will come home 
early he said pennington said a decision would have to be made by 
early thursday 
even if the flight were cut short he said the astronauts would 
achieve most experiment objectives 
pierre thuot capsule communicator in the control center told 
discovery commander mike coats to turn off some lights and other 
systems to assure the crew could complete a fourday mission and 
still have capacity to spend two extra days in orbit in case bad 
weather or some other problem made it impossible to land on the 
fourth day 
among the systems shut down were computers deemed unnecessary and 
two data display screens the shuttle has numerous backup computers 
todays relatively light schedule contrasted with the fire and 
thunder of mondays liftoff and the release of the 100 million 
satellite the missions primary task 
mission control in houston wakened the astronauts with the 
recording by the godfather of soul who is serving sixyear 
sentence in a south carolina prison for charges stemming from a 
twostate auto chase 
were trying to figure out how you got james brown out on 
parole to sing that to us quipped discovery commander mike coats 
that was just a special appearance replied capsule 
communicator david low in the control center we thought that was 
very appropriate music youve got the whole ground team here 
feeling real good 
the deployment of the 2ton tracking and data relay satellite 
completes a network that will enable nasa and the defense department 
to maintain almost constant radio contact with space shuttles and 
more than a score of unmanned satellites 
during the missions remaining days the astronauts were to 
observe four crippled rats explore the causes of space sickness 
conduct tracking tests that could have applications to the star 
wars program research treatment of diseases and film damaged 
areas on earth 
the astronauts rode discovery into orbit monday on the 28th 
shuttle flight and the third since the challenger explosion killed 
seven astronauts more than three years ago 
before the deployment of tracking satellites nasa depended on 
ground stations and their huge dish antennae around the globe 
shuttle astronauts could speak to mission control only as they flew 
over the ground stations a link that covered only about 15 percent 
of each mission 
nasa will soon close six ground stations at a monthly savings of 
3 million

west bank arabs unfairly compared with 42 percent of those under 45

january and february it is not a random survey the questions were 
mailed to jews on a list compiled by market facts a market research 
company sociologist steven m cohen conducted the poll 
of those surveyed 65 percent said israel had used reasonable 
and appropriate force with the exception of a few regrettable 
incidents to put down the palestinian uprising and 79 percent 
felt that israel was treated unfairly by the press 
but 54 percent said they felt that the israelis acted wrongly at 
least to some extent and 43 percent said they were at least 
somewhat embarrassed by israels actions fiftyone percent said 
they were in no way morally outraged by what israel had done 35 
percent felt some outrage 
twentytwo percent said israel should annex the west bank but 38 
percent would return land to the arabs in exchange for peace the 
same number who support us talks with the palestine liberation 
organization 
fiftyeight percent said israel should talk with the plo if the 
group recognizes israel and renounces terrorism

a judge today denied asylum in new york 
to a fugitive indian activist and ordered him sent back to north 
carolina to face kidnapping charges in a 1988 armed takeover of a 
newspaper office 
lawyers for timothy jacobs filed an appeal even before the ruling 
was issued meaning he will remain in new york while the legal 
battle continues 
defense attorney lewis pitts had argued that jacobs life was in 
danger in north carolina because of his knowledge of corruption 
there 
but madison county judge william obrien ii told jacobs youve 
spent the entire time here with the same information about drug 
trafficking and there has been no evidence of any harm to you or any 
threats to you 
the judge revoked jacobs 25000 bail and the 20yearold 
tuscarora indian was taken away to jail 
north carolina gov jim martin has asked new york to return 
jacobs so he can be tried in the takeover of the robesonian 
newspaper in lumberton nc 
jacobs and fellow tuscarora eddie hatcher 31 both of pembroke 
nc used shotguns to hold 20 people hostage for 10 hours before 
surrendering hatcher and jacobs said they were trying to publicize 
allegations of corruption 
the siege ended when martin agreed to investigate their charges 
that county officials were involved in drug dealing and murder a 
task force found no evidence to support the claims which martin 
later said were based on rumor and gossip 
a federal jury acquitted jacobs and hatcher of hostagetaking 
charges in october but they were indicted by a robeson county grand 
jury in december 
jacobs fled north carolina befoe he could be arrested and tried 
to take refuge at the onondaga indian reservation near syracuse 
hatcher had fled to idaho but was arrested friday by the fbi 
after attempting to seek refuge at the soviet consulate in san 
francisco

thousands of moslems wept with joy 
tuesday at the return of a seventh century koran that a religious 
leader said symbolizes radical changes in relations between church 
and state in the soviet union 
cries of god is great echoed along the books path in a 
display of religious fervor seldom seen in the officially atheist 
soviet union 
crowds pressed in on a cordon of police and engulfed a halfdozen 
believers who carried the twofootsquare holy book on their 
shoulders 150 yards from a religious congress to the higher islamic 
institute in tashkent capital of uzbekistan 
one young man jumped from a low portico into the procession as 
the koran was carried through a courtyard he touched his hands to 
his face in a sign of reverence before the crowd swallowed him up 
others pushed their way through to grab frantically at the green 
velvet covering the holy book 
more than 100 policemen on patrol did not interfere 
this is our faith this is the law this is our truth 
ibrahim yusipov said of the book he was in a crowd from southern 
uzbekistan 
believers wiped tears from their eyes as they watched the book 
pass 
officials of the governments council for religious affairs and 
the moslem religious board for central asia and kazakhstan said they 
could not recall such an outpouring of religious fervor 
uzbekistans government turned the koran of caliph osman over to 
moslem authorities at the opening of a congress that elected a new 
mufti or religious leader for predominantly moslem soviet central 
asia and kazakhstan 
mohammadsadyk mamayusupov the 36yearold rector of the higher 
islamic institute was proclaimed mufti by a voice vote of the 375 
delegates 
he replaced shamsubdinkhan babakhan the hereditary mufti who 
resigned in february after religious protests in which he was 
accused of corruption and ignorance of islam 
local believers say the ancient book was one of several dictated 
by caliph osman a close follower of mohammed in the years 
immediately following the founding of their religion in 600 ad it 
was obtained by the russian czars hundreds of years ago and kept in 
their capital st petersburg after the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
it was transferred to a government museum in tashkent 
the book likely was turned over as a sign of official support for 
mamayusupov 
reporting to the congress after donning the white gold and 
rosecolored robe of the mufti mamayusupov praised president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform policies allowing moslems to open new 
mosques and lifting other restrictions 
it is very symbolic that the holy koran of caliph osman has 
been returned to us now that radical changes in relations between 
the church and the state are taking place said mamayusupov 
no protests were evident outside the meeting hall or near the 
institute in separate interviews founders of the radical group 
islam and democracy which claimed it organized the february protest 
against babakhan said their group was in disarray and had slipped 
farther underground 
they said their protests had hurt their own cause because a 
young strong leader was chosen to replace a weak corrupt one they 
feared would work too closely with authorities 
the establishment of the islamic republic of iran and the 
successes of moslem insurgents against the red army in afghanistan 
both along the soviet unions southern frontier worry the kremlin 
because they could increase the religious fervor of the soviet 
unions 50 million moslems 
like other religions in the soviet union islam is under tight 
government control

workers strung a finishline banner above front 
street and installed wiring for tv crews as leaders in the iditarod 
trail sled dog race pressed toward nome 
there is no month of march in nome said howard farley the 
finish coordinator who competed in the first race in 1973 its 
the month of iditarod 
the annual 1168mile race brings excitement attention and money 
to this town of 4300 people and residents have been readying for 
the onslaught of mushers spectators and news teams since 
competitors left anchorage march 4 
susan butcher who has won the race the last three years today 
struggled to hold off joe runyan and rick swenson after regaining 
the lead from runyan late monday 
my dogs love it theyre getting stronger all the time 
butcher said in kouyk 171 miles from the finish line she arrived 
31 minutes ahead of runyan but left with only a nineminute lead 
swenson left koyuk 53 minutes behind butcher 
barring a change in the calm weather that mushers have enjoyed 
since the race began march 4 the winner should reach nome sometime 
early wednesday perhaps in time to beat butchers record of 
slightly more than 11 days 
the progress has been charted by the communitys two radio 
stations both of which sent reporters on the trail 
we tend to go into overdrive about a week before the race 
starts said tom busch manager of knom and a member of the 
iditarod trail committees board of directors 
other workers have been busy with chores such as getting 
permission to use the volunteer fire departments christmas lights 
and testing the municipal siren that heralds the arrival of each 
musher 
everybodys a hero when he finishes the iditarod race here in

its a very appreciated welcome and needed break for us 
said patti james operator of a downtown stoe with the arrival of 
the iditarod and the iditarod basketball tournament the mood picks 
up and the economy surges she said

it is illegal in this state to use drano 
without a permit or trot across a toll bridge on the back of a horse 
but thanks to the state legislature nevadans may win back these 
rights as well as the sanction to graze cattle within three miles 
of the post office 
we asked research to find laws on which there was no 
controversy and which were antiquated said assemblywoman gaylyn 
spriggs 
the assembly voted monday to repeal the laws and the senate is 
expected to follow suit 
some of the provisions date to 1865 
a 1911 statute prohibits riding or driving any animal or 
animals upon a toll bridge faster than a walk 
there are no toll roads on private land in nevada to which the 
law would apply mrs spriggs said 
another law set for repeal is a 1901 statute forbidding sheep 
herders from grazing their flocks within 3mile radius of post

raffles hotel a stately but tattered monument 
to the grandeur of british colonial days closed tuesday for 
renovation to help it compete with the citys skyscraper lodgings 
this is a trip down nostalgia lane for me said frequent 
visitor mike gallagher of darwin australia as he sat beneath 
whirring ceiling fans and sipped a singapore sling in the long bar 
where the ginbased drink was invented 74 years ago 
down the hall padlocks barred lastday visitors from the 
elizabethan grill and the writers bar where literary figures drew 
inspiration 
somerset maugham said to have written the moon and sixpence 
in his suite overlooking the graceful palm court said raffles 
stands for all the fables of the exotic east 
joseph conrad supposedly was inspired to write lord jim while 
sitting on raffles veranda and reading a newspaper story about a 
british crew who abandoned their ship and left 200 passengers to die 
rudyard kipling advised feed at raffles when visiting 
singapore but sleep elsewhere because the beds were uncomfortable 
todays raffles also is surpassed in comfort by the modern 
hotels it needs a coat of paint and the plastic cushions in the 
cramped lobby could do with replacing 
but up until raffles closed its doors at midnight hundreds of 
the curious and nostalgic thronged to the hotel 
some danced to frisco soliano and his quartet others chatted and 
drank under the stars in the palm court or in the long bar where a 
squad of bartenders worked nonstop concocting slings and pouring 
tiger beer 
raffles will reopen in 1991 after 78 million is spent to 
modernize the building restore the grand original entrance and 
build an extension in keeping with the french renaissance style and 
threestory height of the main building 
it will be very faithfully restored as a national monument 
as a grand hotel said richard helfer an american who is 
executive director of the new raffles property management firm 
he has been general manager of the two westin hotels across bras 
basah road from raffles both skyscrapers like the other new hotels 
in this thriving island republic 
but helfer said the new raffles will not be a giant like many 
others instead it will have about 110 suites fewer than the 
present 127 rooms at a luxury level of six stars if you call 
five stars the best 
visitors he said will be drawn to a cultural center to be part 
of the new extension 
raffles is named after sir stamford raffles who founded the 
british colony of singapore in 1819 
the hotel dates to the early 1800s when it was founded as a 
tiffin house or restaurant in a private home but the existing 
hotel was started in 1886 by three armenian brothers 
under the british empire the hotel was a social center for 
colonial officials mariners planters and merchants 
but modern businessminded singapore seemed to give raffles 
little thought it was dwarfed by new hotels and there were fears 
it would be razed as has happened to much of old singapore 
some old monuments have been saved and the governmentcontrolled 
land corporation that holds the raffles property resisted the 
temptation to put up another skyscraper on the valuable land 
still the restoration is a sad event for the staff and those who 
run shops in the groundfloor arcade 
mohamed shariff moneychanger and proprietor of a notions shop 
said he and his father before him had made a good living in raffles 
for 45 years 
its very sad to go he said adding that he had no hope of 
returning in the new hotel theres a new generation coming in 
roberto pregarz the general manager who is leaving along with 
about 200 jobless staff members said theres nothing to 
celebrate tonight

two caged texas cougars were positioned 
tuesday for eventual release in north florida as game officials try 
to revitalize the states experiment on expanding the range of the 
endangered florida panther 
the cats were moved onto private land near the osceola national 
forest and will be allowed to venture out of the cages on their own 
in the next week to 10 days said lt dewey weaver of the game 
commissions lake city office 
in southern florida a native panther that has recovered from 
injuries suffered when hit by a car last november near fort myers 
was scheduled to be released wednesday in corkscrew swamp in 
northern collier county the panther was treated at the university 
of floridas veterinary hospital in gainesville 
fewer than 30 of the florida cats are believed left in the wild 
in the everglades in southern florida they once ranged across the 
state 
the two texas cougars close relatives of the panther and the 
western mountain lion will be set free under a soft release 
technique that allows them to adjust to their new environment before 
their cages are opened 
they leave on their own whenever they are ready to leave 
said weaver it depends on the cats how they settle down and get 
acclimated to that area 
both the western cougars are adults one male and one female 
the cougars sterilized and fitted with radiotracking collars 
are being used to test the area for compatibility for florida 
panthers 
cougars and panthers have many of the same living habits if the 
cougars can survive in north florida game officials might try to 
relocate some florida panthers to the area 
the habitat expansion program suffered major blows in recent 
months with the deaths of three of five cougars released in north 
florida last june a 7000 reward is out for information regarding 
the deaths of two texas cats that died under suspicious 
circumstances 
loss of habitat caused by increasing human population and 
development has been the primary reason for the panthers demise

a forecast tuesday of warmer weather thrust 
this western massachusetts college town into preparations for an 
annual rite of spring the migration of spotted salamanders across a 
road 
several massachusetts communities annually divert traffic so the 
salamanders can get to their breeding pools without getting squished 
by passing cars but amherst has embraced the sixinch amphibians 
with special enthusiasm 
last year more than 200 vounteer salamander herders about equal 
the number of salamanders turned out for the soggy march that marks 
the first rainy spring night when temperatures climb over 40 degrees 
typically the salamanders ease out of their winter burrows 
between midmarch and midapril with temperatures forecast to reach 
50 to 60 degrees in the next few days the town is getting ready 
robert winston an amateur naturalist who has been helping the 
salamanders across the road for more than 12 years has assembled 
volunteer work crews to clear winter debris from the tunnels 
constructed for the salamanders 
based on similar culverts used in britain for migrating toads 
the tunnels are 18 inches wide six inches high and topped with 
grates winston said most of the salamanders used the tunnels after 
mesh fences were installed to guide them to the openings last spring 
to protect strays who head for the roads crews erect 
salamander crossing signs designed by schoolchildren 
its great its nature at its best said stanley ziomek 
town public works superintendent who admits to having a soft spot 
for the navy blue amphibians with yellow polka dots 
the state also is stepping up efforts to protect the salamander 
breeding grounds with a certification program that would make at 
least some of the vernal pools eligible for protection from 
development said peter mireck of the state division of fisheries 
and wildlife 
the pools which are filled only during the wet seasons are 
crucial to many species including salamanders and spring peepers 
which need a breeding place where their eggs wont be eaten by fish 
mireck said 
both mireck and betsy colburne of the massachusetts audubon 
society said they were hard pressed to account for the states 
fascination with salamanders but mireck described their annual 
migration as a harbinger of spring almost like the robins 
and they are very beautiful the biologist maintained

the estimated cost of the pentagons 94 biggest 
weapon programs skyrocketed by 575 billion last year primarily 
because the services want to buy more of certain weapons in the 
mid1990s a new report indicates 
however president bush told congress in february he would cut 
back the military buildup plans of former president reagan so the 
statistics in the latest selected acquisition report released 
tuesday have already been overtaken by events said jim turner 
a pentagon spokesman 
the update is based on the budget and policy guidelines of the 
reagan administration because congress mandates the review be 
conducted every dec 31 turner said 
nonetheless the report outlines the priorities of the services 
and the budget items over which bush congress and the military are 
likely to clash 
as of dec 31 the pentagon said the 94 key programs that reagan 
was pursuing carried a combined pricetag of 8186 billion up 575 
billion or 76 percent from a quarterly estimate last sept 30 
of the increase 427 billion was attributed to changes in 
purchasing plans for the middle and late 1990s and of the 427 
billion more than 40 percent stemmed from changes to just three 
navy programs big jumps in orders for the ddg51 destroyer and the 
ssn21 seawolf submarine plus an increase in orders for trident ii 
missile submarines and missiles 
other programs that had won the blessing of the outgoing reagan 
administration for purchase increases in the out years included 
the armys m1a1 tank ah64 attack helicopter and uh60 blackhawk 
transport helicopter the marine corps aircushioned landing craft 
and the air forces titan iv rocket booster for unmanned satellite 
launches 
pentagon officials declined comment tuesday on how those and 
other purchasing plans might change 
the selected acquisition report is a review of all major weapons 
programs and is designed to provide a broad gauge of how well the 
pentagon is doing in managing its weapons buying 
the reports do not reflect any change in a program unless there 
are major schedule delays or an increase of at least 5 percent in 
the cost the reports do not disclose when the last year of buying 
for each weapon is scheduled 
in the december report most of the programs showing cost 
increases were cited because of changes in the size of the order as 
opposed to management problems of the 575 billion increase 29 
billion was attributed to scheduling problems or changes and 69 
billion to revised contract estimates compared to the 427 billion 
attributed to quantity changes 
the report shows the navy planned to increase by 10 the number of 
ddg51 destroyers it purchased to a new total of 33 as well as 
increase from five to 12 the number of ssn21 seawolf submarines it 
purchased 
both of the those ship types are now in development and have yet 
to enter the fleet 
the navy also planned to increase from 11 to 13 the number of 
huge trident ii nuclear submarines it purchased 
the air force planned to buy 34 more titan iv rocket boosters on 
top of the 23 originally approved and the army planned to buy 1460 
additional m1a1 tanks increasing its total buy to 9317

the bush administration will ask congress for 
an emergency 100 million to help deal with a higherthanexpected 
flow of refugees this year particularly soviet jews secretary of 
state james a baker iii said tuesday 
baker disclosed the request in answer to a question from rep 
david obey dwis at a sometimescontentious budget hearing before 
the house appropriations foreign operations subcommittee which obey 
heads 
obey noted that the administration was asking for a cut in 
refugee spending for the fiscal year opening oct 1 despite 
increased flows of refugees around the world how on earth are we 
going to deal with this problem he asked baker 
baker said a review of refugee programs was under way at the 
state department and would be completed soon after may 1 for the 
current year he said the administration is preparing a request for 
an additional 100 million because we cant make it to the end 
of the year on current appropriations of 412 million 
the request surprised obey who would have to act on any 
supplemental money bill for refugees baker seemed surprised that 
obey did not know about it saying he was supposed to have been 
notified by the office of management and budget several days ago 
an omb spokesman said a supplemental funding package including a 
long list of other requests was still being prepared for submission 
to congress 
the soviet union has been permitting jews to leave the country at 
a high rate in recent months and the state department said last 
week that more than 5000 are in various stages of processing to 
come to the united states obey noted that money to pay for 
resettlement aid would run out in the next three months 
baker said a supplemental money request also would be sent to 
congress to extend us aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels who are 
encamped in honduras along the nicaraguan border current 
humanitarian aid authority runs out at the end of the month 
although supplies are considered adequate to maintain the rebels at 
least through april 
but he termed not accurate reports that the request would 
total 40 million to 50 million the amount that would be needed to 
last the rebels into early 1990 when nicaraguan national elections 
are scheduled 
baker said the effort to maintain the antisandinista contras in 
place was not inconsistent with a call by the five central american 
presidents last month to draw up a plan to disband the 10000man 
force 
it represents a genuine view that they do represent somewhat of 
an incentive for the sandinista government to keep the promises they 
havent kept in the past including steps toward democratization 
and civil liberties he said 
baker and obey clashed repeatedly over obeys announced intention 
to scale back president bushs 146 billion foreign aid request to 
132 billion obey said he was skipping ahead of the normal 
negotiation process to arrive at the foreign aid figure which he 
said was the necessary result of bushs refusal to seek new tax 
revenues 
absent new revenues this is all youre going to get he told 
baker i have read his bushs lips 
if you really believe these things are important this is 
not the way to approach the problem baker responded charging 
that the obey budget would ignore the very real national security 
and foreign affairs needs of this country 
obey replied that democrats are not about to try to dissuade bush 
from his no new taxes campaign pledge but will make him face up 
to the consequences of not having new revenues because then we 
can get rid of these silly phony promises 
he said congress would never consent to exempt foreign aid 
programs from budget cuts while giving an inflationary increase to 
the pentagon and slashing domestic programs such as health and 
education

president bush said tuesday he was troubled by 
ragged pathetic figures huddled over steam grates near the 
white house and vowed to step up the search for solutions to the 
national shame of homelessness 
speaking to a conference of the independent insurance agents of 
america bush called homelessness an affront to the american 
dream 
he made the comments after his motorcade passed a group of 
homeless people huddled on a downtown street a block from the white 
house 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said that bush had 
directed housing secretary jack kemp to come up with new ideas to 
help get the homeless off the streets of urban america 
the word has gone forth to come up with solutions fitzwater 
said 
in his budget outline for fiscal year 1990 bush proposed 
spending 644 million to carry out the mckinney act which created a 
program to find housing for the homeless he also called for a new 
50 million program designed to assist volunteers and community 
organizations working with the homeless 
homelessness affects a small proportion of americans but 
concerns us all bush told his audience 
the president who rode alone in the back of his limousine on the 
way to the downtown hotel where he spoke mentioned his glimpse of 
the homeless as i drove here today 
or when you look out the window of the white house and see the 
ragged pathetic figures huddled over the steam grates of the 
ellipse i see an affront to the american dream a national shame 
if you will 
we must seek the root causes of and devise the most practical 
solutions for the homelessness he said 
turning to issues affecting business bush told the audience of 
insurance agents he opposed what he called a mounting movement 
towards mandated employee benefits 
in an area of tight budgets theres always the temptation to 
drop the burden of social programs on the backs of the employers 
but burdensome mandated benefits serve neither business nor labor 
bush did not elaborate on what he meant by mandated benefits 
but in a speech last week vice president dan quayle voiced similar 
concerns specifying that of immediate concern was legislation 
mandating parental leave legislation requiring health benefits and 
a large acrosstheboard increase in the minimum wage 
the president also said he favors limits on liability judgments 
handed down by juries 
when local governments cannot install playgrounds when 
businesses are bankrupted when mothers struggle to find an 
obstetrician when volunteer organizations boy scouts and girl 
scouts and others have to pull back for fear of excessive claims 
then it is time to consider limiting some of these outrageous 
settlements bush said 
he also defended anew his proposal for a lower tax on capital 
gains saying let the critics carp im going to push for this 
idea that will stimulate jobs risktaking capital formation and 
its good for the economy and it is not a special tax break for the 
rich 
fitzwater bushs press secretary said that the presidents 
statements on homelessness were a followup to views he had 
expressed during last years presidential campaign 
in a 193page report to congress summarizing his fiscal 1990 
budget proposals bush said his administration was committed to 
addressing forcefully the tragedy of homelessness through public and 
private action 
the homeless face difficult and sometimes seemingly 
overwhelming obstacles in getting back on their feet he said in 
that message 
district of columbia officials estimate there are some 8000 to 
10000 homeless in washington although activists for the homeless 
have said they believe the figure ranges to 15000 
nationally experts agree there are no reliable figures although 
research shows that the level of homelessness can range from 300000 
to 600000 on any given night

iran demanded tuesday that moslems 
uphold its order to kill salman rushdie as a blasphemer for writing 
the satanic verses and said they must condemn all who take the 
writers side 
it made the demand at a meeting in riyadh of foreign ministers 
from the 46member of the organization of islamic conference where 
little support for irans extreme position has been evident 
although the iranians succeeded in getting the rushdie affair on 
the agenda of the closed fourday conference it was referred to 
political committee and some delegates said it should be considered 
only as a cultural topic 
ali akbar velayati irans foreign minister is not attending the 
meeting which began monday the chief iranian delegate mohammmad 
ali taskhiri conveyed his governments demands to the associated 
press 
all delegations will issue a strong resolution in denunciation 
of rushdie his book and publisher along with all the governments 
that support him we expect all moslems to uphold gods judgment in 
this connection 
his second point referred to the fatwa or religious execution 
decree issued feb 14 by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 
88yearold shiite moslem patriarch of iran 
rushdies novel was published in 1988 earlier this year it 
caused riots in india and pakistan in which 19 people were killed 
most islamic nations and others with large moslem populations have 
banned it 
indonesia and singapore joined the list tuesday and the religious 
affairs minister of turkey a predominantly moslem secular state 
said the book should be banned there 
rusdie 41 was born in bombay india to moslem parents but now 
is a british citizen and has said he no longer practices religion 
he went into hiding after khomeini ordered him killed and irans 
islamic clerics offered a reward of 52 million 
britains partners in the 12nation european economic community 
recalled their ambassadors to iran after the death sentence along 
with norway sweden and canada iran broke relations with britain on 
march 7 because it refused to suppress the book and act against 
rushdie 
in calling his novel blasphemous moslems cite a scene in which 
prostitutes are given the names of mohammeds wives and a 
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy koran rather than 
receiving it from allah 
prince saud alfaisal the saudi foreign minister took issue 
with taskhiri and noted the delegates had not reached a consensus on 
the book 
four delegates addressed the conference on the rushdie affair 
during the morning session and i heard none of them say anything 
about upholding the death sentence he told a news conference 
he said the organization of islamic conference believes islam 
is not an easy prey for those bent on harming it and i dont 
believe the faith is in any danger we are not afraid of any attacks 
that may come from books or any media organ 
taskhiri who heads the islamic affairs division of the iranian 
foreign ministry said rushdies book was a rabid campaign against 
our islamic ideals and beliefs a crushing onslaught on islam 
requiring a strong and decisive response 
speaking for saudi arabia saud said we are waiting to hear 
the statements of the delegates he said the saudies were in touch 
with several countries to prevent the matter from damaging 
prospects of religious tolerance 
king fahds government has banned the satanic verses but has 
not supported the iranian demand that rushdie be killed 
a group of islamic theologians meeting in mecca saudi arabia 
the holiest shrine of islam issued a declaration tuesday that 
islamic law allows rushdie the opportunity to repent 
other issues on the conference agenda include the palestinian 
problem and ways of regaining occupied territory from israel 
a subcommittee of egypt iraq syria lebanon palestine jordan 
algeria and tunisia was appointed to consider those issues saud 
told reporters egypt is the only arab nation to have signed a peace 
treaty with isrel 
about afghanistn he said moslem guerrillas have received the 
support of the oic since the beginning of their struggle against 
soviet military forces and the islamic organization will continue 
to support them 
soviet withdrawal from afghanistan was completed feb 15 and the

bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
arens interviewed from washington on israels army radio said 
the us administration made no concrete proposals about how to 
reduce tensions in the territories 
i said nobody is interested in reducing this tension more than 
we are but how to do that is another question arens said 
arab hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded six 
palestinians in the occupied territories tuesday and severely beat a 
12yearold boy with clubs fracturing his skull

city of nablus they said 
at least 396 palestinians and 17 israelis have been killed since 
the uprising broke out dec 8 1987 
in its new leaflet the unified national leadership of the 
uprising called on palestinians who work in the service branches of 
the israeli military government in occupied areas to resign 
immediately or be attacked violently 
consider this leaflet as a last warning the notice said 
it also called for intensifying resistance to israeli rule and 
ordered a boycott of israeli goods beginning march 28 
israels masscirculation yediot ahronot newspaper gave 
frontpage play to a story that three unnamed members of the 
rightwing likud bloc met with unidentified plo leaders in tunis in 
an effort to end the uprising 
a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir the head of likud 
denied the report 
science minister ezer weizman of the rival labor party accused 
shamir of trying to avoid peace negotiations and said labor should 
quit the coalition government if shamir does not get israel to the 
negotiating table to summer 
i dont want to be unkind to him but i have a feeling he would 
like to twiddle and turn and do some political aerobatics and find a 
way to have his cake and eat it weizman told reporters in his 
office 
lets say if by june july august nothing happens i think 
the labor party has to crystallize their policy and get the hell out 
of the government he said 
shamir refuses to speak to the palestine liberation organization 
saying it is a terror organization that wants to destroy the jewish 
state contacts with the plo are outlawed in israel although 
legislators have immunity from prosecution

romanian media reported tuesday that a 
senior romanian diplomat had been charged with espionage and emigre 
sources linked the case to a letter by veteran communists demanding 
improved human rights 
an announcement from the romanian general prosecutors office 
carried in romanian dailies and on the state news agency agerpres 
said mircea raceanu had been engaged in steady treasonable 
action since 1974 when he allegedly was recruited to spy for an 
unidentified country 
raceanu served in washington during the 1970s and most recently 
was deputy head of the foreign ministrys us desk in bucharest he 
was arrested in january 
the general prosecutors office did not mention a letter that 
five communists and raceanus father had signed condemning economic 
and political policies of president nicolae ceausescu 
the letter written in january first reached the west over the 
weekend and was prominently reported on western radio stations 
broadcasting to romania 
it also was reported by official media in yugoslavia and hungary 
indicating romanias growing isolation from its communist allies 
the letter marked the first time senior communists have banded 
together to protest ceausescus policies 
it attacked romanias isolation in europe and ceausescus plans 
to destroy up to 7000 of the countrys 13000 villages in a 
resettlement campaign 
how are you going to improve romanias external relations when 
all the leaders of the noncommunist nations of europe refuse to 
meet with you the letter said according to a text made available 
to the associated press 
it demanded an immediate halt to food exports from the 
shortageplagued agricultural nation 
the letter also condemned a late 1970s decree that forbids 
romanians to speak to foreigners and denounced alleged systematic 
violations of private mail and telephone communications 
it was signed by raceanus father ion former politburo members 
gheorghe apostol and alexandru birladeanu former foreign minister 
corneliu manescu and party veteran constantin pirvelscu 
silviu brucan a former ambassador to the united states was the 
sixth signatory repeated calls in the past three days to brucans 
bucharest home have gone unanswered 
radio bucharest played what it said were taped interviews from 
workers meetings in several bucharest plants it did not explain 
how such gatherings could be organized just hours after the first 
publication of the charges against raceanu 
i was stupefied after reading the communique in our press our 
socialist justice must deal exemplary punishment to such traitors 
a worker from the grivita rosie chemical equipment plant in 
bucharest was heard saying 
foreign circles envious of romanias achievements are trying 
to torpedo its achievements another said 
emigre sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said raceanu 
and his wife were detained jan 31 en route to the us 
amabassadors residence for a film showing but that she later was 
released 
a western diplomat in bucharest confirmed by telephone that 
raceanu was invited to the movie but did not show up raceanu later

empress zita of austria the last 
queen of the hapsburg empire who was denounced as a spy for her role 
in a plot to end world war i died tuesday in this town 20 miles 
from the country that shunned her she was 96 
her late husband charles i was the last king of the 
multilingual austrianhungarian monarchy who gave up his imperial 
rights after the allied victory in world war i 
the empress who never formally abdicated and was barred from 
austrian territory for 64 years had been ailing for some time said 
bernd posselt a spokesman for the house of hapsburg 
born may 9 1892 in pianore castle near viareggio italy the 
former princess of bourbonparma was related to several european 
royal families 
charles i became emperor of austria and king of hungary after the 
death of his uncle francis joseph who had reigned for 68 years 
when charles and zita were crowned they believed only a rapid 
truce could save the crumbling dual monarchy then allied with the 
reich of the german kaiser zita then 24 had a key role in 
arranging secret contacts with the allies in search of a peace 
treaty 
the gobetween was her brother prince sixtus of bourbonparma 
then serving in the belgian army he was in touch with french 
president raymond poincare who in turn notified king george v of 
britain 
french premier georges clemenceau who hated poincare revealed 
the secret in 1918 creating an international stir and rocking the 
germanaustrian alliance german propaganda whipped up sentiment 
against the oncepopular zita labeling her the spy of the 
bourbons 
after the allied victory in 1918 charles i agreed to 
temporarily relinquish his imperial rights the couple initially 
lived in exile in a lake geneva chateau where charles launched two 
attempts to recapture the hungarian throne 
after the second bid in 1921 the allies banished them to the 
portuguese island of madeira charles died there of pneumonia a year 
later at age 34 
zita was a 29yearold widow and mother of eight turning down 
invitations from royal relatives she chose to bring up her children 
in modest settings in a spanish fishing village and the belgian 
countryside 
when adolf hitler moved to annex austria her oldest son otto 
the new head of the house of hapsburg urged the western allies to 
intervene which made the nazis issue an order for his arrest 
the family fled to canada and the united states living for a 
time in tuxedo park ny 
after world war ii zita toured american cities to promote 
humanitarian aid for austria in the early 1950s she returned to 
europe eventually settling at zizers 
in 1982 austria lifted the entry ban following a personal 
request by king juan carlos of spain on her first return to vienna 
she was cheered by 10000 people 
since 1965 zita who once held court at viennas 
versaillessized castle of schoenbrunn lived in two small rooms of 
a roman catholic home for the aged in this village on the upper 
rhine she turned down offers for a bigger apartment family photos 
and an oil portrait of her husband provided a personal touch in her 
small living quarters 
zita dressed in black from the time her husband died and never 
wore jewelry 
the empress will lie in state in the austrian capital at st 
stephens cathedral she will be buried april 1 at the traditional 
hapsburg burial vault in viennas capuchin church 
charles is buried on madeira one of zitas wishes was that his 
remains be transferred to vienna so they could be reunited in death

as he prepares to take a seat at the cabinet 
table edward j derwinski is warning military veterans not to 
expect miracles from the new veterans affairs department but 
painful budgets in the next few years instead 
i was never one to promise what i couldnt produce the 
former illinois congressman said in an interview i would much 
rather underpromise and have them pleasantly surprised at the end 
than overpromise 
derwinski heads the secondlargest agency in the federal 
government the veterans administration which on wednesday becomes 
the 14th cabinet department veterans groups had sought the 
upgrading for years but the electionyear endorsement of the idea 
by thenpresident reagan was needed to bring it about 
to mark the change derwinski will take the oath of office at the 
white house and attend a ceremony on the south lawn 
in the long run i think were going to do well derwinski 
said monday he said he was talking about five 10 or 15 years 
the short run is a different story 
what i tried to tell the american legion is the mere creation 
of a department is not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for 
us budgetwise he said 
derwinski said he was assuming that the political facts of life 
are that in the short run neither the president nor the congress is 
going to step out and say i want new taxes 
he said he further assumed neither the president nor the 
congress is going to step out and say scrap 
grammrudmanhollings the law requiring declining budget 
deficits 
so my personal view is that the law will run its course the 
discipline of it will run its course thats the next four years in 
those four years there are going to be some painful budget 
decisions my job is to see that the va does better in the budget 
infighting than it would have if i werent aboard 
that is precisely why the veterans organizations and their 
congressional supporters fought so long for the department they 
believed the rank of a cabinet officer would enable them to do 
better in the infighting 
whether it will happen that way remains to be seen in a report a 
year ago the national academy of public administration said it did 
not believe cabinet status would significantly improve either 
access to the president the adequacy of necessary resources or the 
organization management and delivery of highquality services and 
benefits 
though its 240000 employees are more than any federal agency 
except the defense department and its budget is the fifth largest 
the va is an uncomplicated organization derwinski has six months to 
reorganize it but he says any changes wont be drastic 
there are basically just three parts medical care money 
benefits and the operation of 111 national cemeteries where 53000 
veterans and members of their families are buried every year 
the first two parts are gigantic with 172 hospitals 229 
outpatient clinics and scores of other installations the agency 
runs the largest medical care system in the country and one of the 
largest in the world spending 108 billion a year and taking care 
of 14 million hospital patients annually 
veterans benefits pensions insurance mortgage guarantees and 
other programs account for about 17 billion a year 
derwinski has been praised by members of congress for his open 
style and for winning approval in principle from the office of 
management and budget for a 300 million supplemental appropriation 
for the current fiscal year for va medical care 
he said in the interview that the approval was only 90 percent 
we dont have the official omb blessing 
some of the agencys medical issues have been frontpage issues 
for years for example posttraumatic stress disorder in vietnam 
veterans and possible health effects of the defoliant agent orange 
derwinski though is looking down the road 
the big problem is one interestingly where there is no 
debate aging the patients needs start to change it 
ultimately means longterm health care rather than dramatic surgical 
procedures 
it is projected that the number of veterans over 75 will grow 
from more than 12 million to 44 million in the year 2005

the federal trade commission must require 
health warnings on promotional items such as tshirts caps and tote 
bags given away by makers of snuff and chewing tobacco a federal 
appeals court ruled tuesday 
the commission disregarded the clear instructions of congress 
when it exempted those items from the 1986 requirement of health 
warnings in advertising for smokeless tobacco products said a 
threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia 
the panels decision upheld a lower court ruling of last year 
the 1986 legislation at issue exempted only billboards and 
congressional sponsors of the bill submitted statements to the 
commission that they fully intended promotional items bearing 
product logos to carry the warnings 
the warning must be one of these 
warning this product may cause mouth cancer 
warning this product may cause gum disease and tooth loss 
warning this product is not a safe alternative to 
cigarettes 
the commission said it feared the phrase this product would 
be taken as referring to the tshirt or other item rather than the 
tobacco and thus be ridiculed 
the commission is sensitive to the need to avoid diminishing 
the seriousness of the required warnings by mandating their display 
in absurd situations the commission said 
the courts decision however said warnings on these items 
would have conceded benefits the ftcs position is that the 
perceived negative effects derision etc would either outweigh 
those benefits or render them minimal this balancing requires a 
more explicit congressional grant of authority than is present 
here 
the commissions case might have merit if the congressional 
directive would clearly lead to absurd results but congress 
rigidity is not a sign of its folly but rather signals its intent 
to act swiftly and deciively to stem the dangerous growth of 
smokeless tobacco consumption whatever else may be said congress 
has the general authority to take such rigid measures the court 
said 
susan ticknor a spokeswoman for the commission said lawyers 
there had not seen the decision and could not comment 
the exemption for promotional items was challenged by the 
american heart lung and public health associations the american 
cancer society and public citizen and was defended by a trade 
association the smokeless tobacco council in a friendofthecourt

washingtons worst outbreak of meningococcal 
disease in more than a decade has caused four deaths this year and 
has health officials considering a costly countywide vaccination 
program 
seventeen people have contracted some form of meningococcal 
disease including six who got meningitis inflammation of the 
membranes that envelop the brain and the spinal cord 
people are freaking out about this all over said marcy 
smith whose 2yearold daughter was one of about 400 people 
vaccinated monday the shots went primarily to children in this 
yakima indian reservation town of 3300 about eight miles south of 
yakima 
i think we are on top of the current cases yakima county 
health director dr bob atwood said as the battle against the 
disease intensified he said officials knew of no other suspected 
cases im not willing to predict there wont be another case 
he said 
fighting the disease has cost the county 30000 to buy vaccine 
and an asyet uncalculated amount in overtime pay for employees 
working 16hour days if the health department decides on a 
countywide vaccination program the cost of medical supplies is 
estimated at 356000 health officials said 
county commissioners said they planned to inform gov booth 
gardners office tuesday about the costs and were considering 
whether to ask for emergency state assistance said sylvia hinojosa 
of the commission office 
the state department of social and health services has alerted 
other counties to be on the lookout for any increase in 
meningococcal disease but knows of none outside yakima county said 
dr nancy snapp 
seventy to 80 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the 
state each year and the yakima outbreak is the largest since 1978 
officials have said 
the dead include three children under age 1 and a 23yearold 
yakima man 
in selah an apple country suburb north of yakima where the 17th 
case was confirmed over the weekend in an infant 2400 
schoolchildren were given notices to report to a school to be 
interviewed by health workers and if necessary receive either the 
vaccine or rifampin which kills the meningococcal germs in the nose 
and throat and thus halts the spread of the disease 
we identified five children playing with the infant on a daily 
basis atwood said 
the disease is primarily passed through coughing and other 
contact with secretions from the nose and throat atwood said 
the health director has come under fire for a decision to 
withhold information about the outbreak from the public until 
reporters found out about it late last week 
noting the disease has all the symptoms of the common cold 
atwood said he feared anxious parents would overload medical 
facilities and delay health care for the truly sick emergency rooms 
were flooded by concerned parents over the weekend he said 
meningococcal disease usually has a mortality rate of 10 percent 
while the yakima outbreak is running at nearly 25 percent 
officials have contacted the federal centers for disease control 
in atlanta to help determine why this outbreak which is of the 
lesscommon type c strain of the disease is so dangerous

the bush administration announced today the 
immediate suspension of imports of thousands of semiautomatic 
assaulttype weapons 
the order effective immediately will bar the importation of 
more than 110000 such weapons for which import applications are 
pending said national drug control director william j bennett 
bennett said treasury secretary nicholas brady decided to 
suspend effective immediately the importation of several makes of 
assaulttype weapons pending a decision as to whether these weapons 
are as required by law particularly suitable for or readily 
adaptable to sporting purposes bennett said 
bennett and brady had been asked to look into ways of dealing 
with the proliferation of such weapons amid mounting violence among 
drug dealers in inner city areas 
the decision came after conferences among brady bennett and 
stephen e higgins the director of the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms who supported the decision 
theyve been conferring during the last week said atf 
spokesman dick pedersen higgins and bennett together felt it was 
time to suspend the importation so we are doing that 
in the past three years atf has approved the import of 88000 
such weapons and in 1989 so far the atf has received requests to 
import many more than the total imported during the previous three 
years bennett said in a statement 
affected by the decision are imports of ak47s uzi carbines 
fnfal and fnfnctype weapons as well as steyr aug semiautomatic 
weapons 
atf has the authority to regulate the importation of weapons 
into the united states to make sure they fall into certain 
categories pedersen said were saying some of these weapons 
may not fall into some of the prescribed categories such as 
hunting 
were not going to approve these pending applications until we 
have time to look at the situation further to see if these firearms 
do meet the conditions set forth for their importation he said 
bush a lifetime member of the national rifle association had 
voiced concerns about the weapons but said he also wanted to do 
whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the import ban was 
decided on after it was learned that applications for imported 
semiautomatics had tripled this year over the total for the past 
three years 
the administration action came a day after the california state 
assembly voted to ban 40 types of semiautomatic assault weapons 
that legislation must be reconciled with an earlier vote by the 
california state senate to ban all semiautomatic weapons fitting a

taba israelioccupied egypt ap employees of the sonesta 
hotel saw to it tuesday that this patch of a tourist resort an 
irritant to israeliegyptian relations for years would not be 
handed over to cairo without one last fuss 
they waved signs and israeli flags and burned tires in a 
demonstration to ask what will become of them when the 250acre 
strip of beach becomes part of egyptian territory on wednesday 
the hotel is in egypt the management is in israel and the 
employees are in the garbage said a sign carried by one of the 
more than 300 workers 
they staged the protest as egyptian workers in long galabia robes 
put up a border gate and israeli soldiers in drab olive uniforms 
built their barrier nearby 
egyptian tourism minister fuad sultan walked by scores of 
protesters and said all was going well 
im sure that this will be the cornerstone for a better 
normalization process between the two countries he said 
so far taba has had exactly the opposite effect 
when israel withdrew from the sinai peninsula under a peace 
treaty in 1982 it stayed in taba which contains little more than 
the 12story hotel and a village of thatched huts 
both israel and egypt maintained the land was theirs with their 
arguments tracing back to where the border was in 1906 between 
britishheld sinai and turkishruled palestine 
in september an international arbitration panel accepted egypts 
version on feb 26 the nations agreed the land would be handed 
over to egypt on wednesday 
on tuesday egyptian and israeli officials worked out final 
details including arranging passes stamped by egypt israel and 
the sonesta hotel to give israeli workers access to their jobs 
but the employees are worried about an egyptian law requiring that 
90 percent of workers in a hotel be egyptian 
tomorrow this is going to be egypt and we dont know whats 
happening said erez efrat the 30yearold protest leader they 
tell us we dont have a problem but what about in a month 
the workers also are concerned about economics one carried a 
sign saying an egyptian works for 100 a month an israeli for 
1000 who do you think will be employed 
the hotel has distributed circulars saying the staff and 
management will stay the same although it has been bought by 
egyptians for 37 million 
other details being negotiated tuesday were passes for israeli 
guests and 24hour access to taba a 15minute drive from the 
israeli resort town of eilat 
on tuesday western tourists israelis and egyptian workers 
climbed atop a rocky hill overlooking the red sea that offers a view 
of egypt the tip of israel and jordan 
samer abdi shahed a 23yearold cairo native taking a break from 
putting up a new flagpole looked out from the hill every piece 
of the land of egypt is part of my heart he said 
a 25yearold israeli woman who identified herself only as irit 
heard his comment and declared the land should be israels because 
all that is here was built by israelis 
another israeli david biton 32 said he was reluctant to leave 
taba he has been living on the beach and his 10monthold daughter 
named taba was born here 
he said he put up a tent on the hill but police made him take it 
down so he painted love taba in red paint on the rocks

the conservative government set aside its 
taxreforming zeal tuesday and unveiled a budget more cautious than 
expected underscoring its commitment to combat inflation with high 
interest rates 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced in the house 
of commons the government will leave income tax rates unchanged in 
the fiscal year beginning april 1 
he also projected a 24 billion surplus much larger than 
expected 
provided we stand firm on our resolves against inflation the 
prospects before us are excellent lawson said 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party condemned the 
budget as a botched attempt to make up for the chancellors 
excesses and messes of last year 
last march lawson slashed britains income tax rates by cutting 
the top band from 60 percent to 40 percent and reducing the basic 
rate from 27 percent to 25 percent 
the cuts spurred britains strong spending boom and worsened its 
trade deficit which widened to 363 billion in january from 304 
billion in december 
inflation increased from an annual rate of 33 percent to 75 
percent 
this prompted prime minister margaret thatchers government to 
push the commercial banks base interest rates to 13 percent from a 
low of 75 percent in june 
economists were expecting lawson to tread carefully tuesday and 
he was more restrained than expected 
the budget requires approval from parliament which is assured by 
the conservative partys large majority 
under britains budgetary process the chancellor announces how 
the government will raise revenue in his spring statement in an 
autumn statement he details the spending plans 
lawson said he would raise in line with inflation allowances on 
personal income taxes and the thresholds at which taxpayers begin 
making payments 
market forecasts had called for these limits to be increased at a 
rate significantly higher than inflation 
lawson also eased the burden on employees for contributions to 
national insurance which pays for social services and simplified 
the system in addition he eased taxes on small businesses 
investors in socalled personal equity plans which invest in british 
stocks and on unleaded gasoline but he increased taxes on company 
cars 
the tax measures will reduce revenue in fiscal 1990 by less than 
34 billion the chancellor said 
he said britain will have a budget surplus of 24 billion in the 
new year matching its surplus in the current year forecasts had 
predicted the surplus would be about 52 billion 
lawson said he expects britains economic growth to slow to 25 
percent this year following 45 percent growth in 1988 
he said some slowdown in growth is inevitable as we get 
inflation back onto a downward path indeed it has almost certainly 
already begun to happen 
lawson said he expects the annual inflation rate to increase to 8 
percent over the next few months then fall to 55 percent by the 
fourth quarter and to 45 percent in the second quarter of 1990 
interest rates will stay as is needed or as long as is needed 
for there will be no letting up on our determination to get on top 
of inflation lawson said 
however unwelcome high interest rates must be they are 
preferable to the damage done by high inflation lawson said

fifty years ago wednesday nazi 
troops invaded czechoslovakia in what one historian says was an 
unavoidable consequence of the wests abandonment of the nation and 
adolf hitlers plan to conquer europe 
in september 1938 czechoslovakias allies britain and france 
bowed to german pressure and agreed to hitlers annexation of 
czechoslovakias germanspeaking sudetenland region nearly 
onethird of the nations territory 
any western hopes that appeasement would dissuade hitler from 
allout war on eastern europe ended germany invaded the rest of 
czechoslovakia on march 15 1939 
less than half a year later hitlers army rolled across polish 
borders and world war ii began 
the czechoslovak invasion was inevitable independent historian 
milos hajek said in an interview 
hitlers intentions were quite clear after the annexation he 
said the strategy of the czech government was to make maximum 
concessions to hitler but even that didnt pay off 
another czech a 25yearold leftwing student at the time said 
the greatest mistake was that they prague leaders believed in 
the west which proved to be so weak 
when germany swallowed austria on march 12 1938 hundreds of 
thousands feted the arriving troops 
in prague and other czech towns none cheered 
witnesses in prague recalled that citizens retreated to side 
streets to hide their shame and disgust others confronted the 
invaders with clenched fists and shouted abuse 
i remember the weather was awful sleet and rain and i can 
still see the german bombers hovering above prague which was quite 
a feat in those days with that kind of weather said the former 
student who spoke on condition of anonymity 
i said to myself what would it be like if there was war today 
this must perhaps be better he added 
the last meeting of the czechoslovak government in prague was 
held on march 9 1939 state president emil hacha ordered the ouster 
of the slovak government after its dissident leaders negotiated with

defense secretarydesignate dick cheney said 
today he supports a twoyear defense budget a stance applauded by 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn as hearings opened 
on cheneys nomination 
my preference is longrange cheney told the committee whose 
members voiced praise for his nomination 
nunn dga said he hoped that when cheney expresses his support 
for a twoyear defense budget in talks with bush administration 
officials he wins that argument 
the hearing opened with introductions from sen malcolm wallop 
rwyo a member of the armed services panel who said cheneys 
sense of humility and a sense of presence served him well and will 
serve america well 
senate republican whip alan simpson also of wyoming called 
cheney the most steady and unflappable man i have ever known and 
he will need it all 
bush announced friday that cheney would be his nominee for the 
pentagon post one day after the senate rejected john tower a 
former texas senator by a 5347 vote 
the vote capped a bitter partisan debate in the senate where 
lawmakers expressed concerns over allegations of excessive drinking 
and womanizing against tower and his work as a paid defense 
consultant after government service 
nunn is one of the chief supporters of a twoyear budget for the 
pentagon instead of the present oneyear practice which he 
contends would provide more stability in defense spending and allow 
defense department managers to spend money more efficiently and cut 
costs 
the twoyear budget plan has been supported by top pentagon 
officials and congressional leaders for several years but has not 
yet been approved by administration and congressional budget 
managers 
cheney lacks towers defense experience but his background as 
former president fords white house chief of staff for 14 months and 
reputation as a compromiser places him in good standing 
i think dick cheney knows what one needs to know when one takes 
over that post said senate democratic whip alan cranston of 
california he will learn a lot more detail now he is well aware 
of the broad concepts and as chief of staff at the white house he 
had to know a great deal about national defense matters 
cheney is a member of the house select committee on intelligence 
and the ranking republican on the panels program and budget 
authorization subcommittee 
the sixterm congressman has supported the mx missile funding 
for reagans strategic defense initiative commonly known as star 
wars production of new chemical weapons and passage of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty the ussoviet pact 
eliminating medium and shortrange missiles 
but his comments in may 1984 raise questions about whether cheney 
will support the mx which is favored by national security adviser 
brent scowcroft over the singlewarhead midgetman which democrats 
in congress have backed 
i too think we should pursue the concept of small mobile 
singlewarhead missiles like the midgetman cheney said but i 
am a skeptic because i question whether or not this house will ever 
be prepared to vote to deploy the midgetman 
on the issue of pentagon reform cheney has been a member of the 
military reform caucus an informal bipartisan organization of 
house and senate members who have tried to change the way the 
defense department does business 
in 1985 cheney voted for limits on revolving door job 
switches from the pentagon to private military supply companies and 
for legislation requiring the pentagon to maintain records of 
contractors proposed and negotiated cost and pricing data both 
measures won approval by lopsided margins 
his voting record in favor of reagans proposals won cheney a 100 
percent score from the conservative american security council and a 
zero rating from the council for a livable world a prodisarmament 
group 
to date cheney has already supported one idea that many members 
of congress favor a detailed national security strategy 
in 1986 cheney rep bob mcewen rohio and sen john warner of 
virginia ranking republican on the senate armed services committee 
sponsored what they referred to as the national strategy act 
the measure called for the administration to provide along with 
the annual budget message a comprehensive written report on the 
national security strategy of the united states including the 
countrys vital interests goals and objectives and the 
foreign policy worldwide commitments and national defense 
capabilities necessary to deter aggression

east germany charged tuesday that west german 
mining activities may have contributed to a severe earthquake that 
rocked east german border towns but it also said its own miners may 
be at fault 
the 12second temblor monday afternoon injured seven people and 
damaged 200 east german homes along the two germanys border said 
east germanys state news agency adn 
it suggested a blast at merkers potash mine on the east german 
side of the border caused a cavein and shifting of underground rock 
formations that touched off the earthquake 
but adn also said west german potash operations just across the 
border may have created the seismic tension conditions that made 
the tremor possible by pumping waste water that seeped into east 
german mineshafts 
adn also said faults among mine officials on the east german 
side or insufficient scientific knowledge about previously 
unused mining fields could not be excluded 
the agency said experts believe waste water from the west german 
potash operations was the main cause of a cavein and shifting 
of rock formations that set off the quake 
west german officials could not be reached to comment on the 
charge tuesday night 
both sides of the german frontier were struck by the temblor but 
east germany apparently bore the brunt 
some of the injured were struck by falling chimney bricks it 
said 
the quake sent children fleeing from their schools and forced 
miners to spend two hours underground until the danger was over adn 
reported no miners were hurt 
i had the feeling that everything was falling apart the 
agency quoted voelkershausen mayor herbert hermann as saying i 
watched as cracks formed on my walls and plaster fell from the 
ceiling all i could think of was opening a window and getting out 
of there 
voelkershausen 130 miles southwest of leipzig and six miles from 
the west german border was hardesthit of the east german border 
communities the quake knocked out electricity and water services 
and badly damaged 80 percent of homes of the 1350 townspeople adn 
reported 
residents were evacuated from 15 homes that are no longer 
inhabitable and were taken in by neighbors and relatives adn 
said 
the news agency said miners detonated controlled explosions in 
the mine at 201 pm monday 
a large mining field caved in when the earthquake began it said 
but miners were working about 2000 feet beneath the earth and were 
protected by special steelencased chambers they use during 
underground blasting 
even as the severe tremor was occurring above them their lives 
and health were never in danger adn reported 
the miners returned to the surface after about two hours the 
agency said 
it did not say how many miners were underground at the time or 
whether there were any difficulties getting them out 
west german authorities said the earthquake registered 57 on the 
richter scale while adn put the magnitude at 55 such a quake can 
cause considerable damage 
bruce presgrave of the us geological survey in boulder colo 
said his office received reports the quake may have originated in a 
rockburst which occurs when rocks under pressure suddenly fail 
such events often happen in mining areas 
according to the surveys files the quake was one of the largest 
on record in that part of germany the largest previous quake 
occurred feb 22 1953 and measured 54 it said

iran said tuesday it was ready to resume 
stalled peace talks with iraq next month but the two countries 
exchanged accusations of ceasefire violations 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iraqi troops 
violated the unsponsored ceasefire by shelling iranian positions 
in three cities across the southern border starting late monday 
night 
an iraqi military spokesman said the iranians shelled the 
positions of an infantry division in the southern port city of 
basra official baghdad radio reported 
the radio said the un observers did not comment on the 
incident but they confirmed an iraqi complaint had been registered 
irna which is monitored in nicosia quoted a military official 
as saying five iranian soldiers were wounded during the iraqi 
bombardment of the southern cities of shalamcheh abadan and 
khorramshahr 
irna accused the iraqis of starting the latest border clash and 
said the shelling of the port cities of khorramshahr and abadan 
tuesday afternoon created panic among personnel of the un 
iraniraq military observer group 
although the iraqi troops initiated the clash they contacted 
the uniimog eight times appealing for an end to the fire exchange 
irna quoted the military official as saying 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati meanwhile proposed 
resuming peace talks with iraq in the third week of april to show 
our goodwill irna reported 
i stress again that at this moment there is nothing more 
important than the withdrawal of iraqi forces from iranian 
territory velayati said in an interview with the agency 
until the withdrawal takes place there will be no progress in 
the talks he said 
the unsponsored peace talks in the eightyear persian gulf war 
began five days after a unmediated ceasefire took effect last 
aug 20 
but the talks broke down immediately over the issue of iraqi 
troop withdrawals and the status of the shatt alarab waterway 
three further rounds of talks failed to break the deadlock 
un special envoy jan eliasson held separate meetings in new 
york last week with velayati and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
on resuming talks 
the two belligerents agreed in january to form a joint military 
group to help un observers supervise the ceasefire agreement but 
the group has failed to meet ever since 
iran claimed last week that iraqi forces hold a total of 1028 
square miles of iranian territory 
according to united nations estimates iraqi troops still occupy 
about 260 square miles of iranian territory 
i have asked the un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to deal seriously with this issue velayati said 
velayati insists that as the next step in implementing the un 
security council peace plan contained in the 1987 resolution iraq 
should withdraw to the border recognized in a 1975 treaty between 
the two neighbors 
iraqi president saddam hussein abrogated that treaty in 1980 
just before iraqi troops pushed across the border after weeks of 
clashes between patrolling soldiers 
iraq argues that irans revolutionary government under ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini disavowed all previous treaties and the 1975 
treaty no longer is in effect 
iran says it never relinquished the treaty under international 
law a treaty is valid unless all parties agree to a change 
in riyadh saudi arabia meanwhile islamic foreign ministers met 
tuesday to arrange a swap of prisoners between iran and iraq and 
discuss ways to revive peace talks between the longtime foes 
sources said 
the ministers meeting under the auspices of the 46member 
organization of islamic conference also planned to discuss postwar 
reconstruction projects in the persian gulf nations

winston moseley convicted of stabbing kitty 
genovese to death while 38 of her neighbors listened but did nothing 
to help her sought a new trial on the 25th anniversary of the 
slaying 
moseley 54 is serving a life term for the march 13 1964 
murder he maintained in court papers that he did not receive a fair 
trial because his lawyer was representing miss genovese in another 
matter at the time of her death according to dick piperno a 
spokesman for queens district attorney john santucci 
a hearing on moseleys motion was scheduled april 6 in state 
supreme court moseley prepared the case himself and filed the 
papers in recent weeks piperno said 
the district attorneys reply has not been prepared yet but it 
was expected the motion would be opposed 
the story of miss genoveses murder received wide attention as a 
symbol of urban apathy and an indictment of people who play deaf 
because they are afraid to get involved 
the victim a 28yearold bar manager was stalked for half an 
hour as she walked home from work her screams roused 38 people from 
their beds but no one helped or even called police 
moseley arrested later for a burglary admitted killing miss 
genovese and was tried in june 1964 
he said in his motion that his courtappointed lawyer sidney 
sparrow did not disclose that he had represented miss genovese in 
an appeal of a bookmaking conviction 
moseley said sparrows silence about a conflict of interest 
warranted a new trial 
sparrow 76 and still practicing law said he was certain he had 
told both moseley and the trial judge of his prior connection with 
the victim he also said his representation of the woman ended with 
her death 
moseley was condemned to death but the sentence was changed to 20 
years to life on appeal three applications for parole since 1984 
have been denied

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane his face red and his eyes filling with tears lashed out 
at the prosecutor in the oliver north trial tuesday when asked about 
a letter he wrote congress on the day before he tried to commit 
suicide 
the first openly emotional moment at the north trial now in its 
second month was triggered by chief prosecutor john keker who 
suggested to mcfarlane that his feb 8 1987 letter to rep lee 
hamilton dind was just complete nonsense 
well mr keker if i had sat down in my state of mind the day 
before i tried to take my life if i had tried to parse every last 
dime that went to the contras it probably would have come out 
different mcfarlane retorted 
in the letter mcfarlane told hamilton then chairman of the 
house intelligence committee that a foreigner had offered in a may 
1984 meeting with him to contribute money to the nicaraguan contras 
and that the amount eventually donated was 5 million or less 
mcfarlane had known for two years that the offer came from the 
government of saudi arabia through its ambassador and that the 
country donated 32 million to the contras starting in 1984 
but mcfarlane testified he had wanted to be sure the committee 
had the full facts about the contribution speaking rapidly he said 
youre quite right if i had taken the time it probably would 
have come out differently in my state of mind at the time if i had 
really taken the time to tote it up it would have toted up far 
more 
glaring at keker he said if thats your point youre right 
im dead wrong i knew darn well it was something close to a million 
dollars a month i was acknowledging my participation in a 
thirdcountry donation and i wanted that on the record 
when keker pointed out that the letter claimed the money was from 
the foreigners own wealth and not from any government 
mcfarlane replied that is a gloss but that is what he the saudi 
ambassador told me 
while keker was asking questions defense attorney brendan 
sullivan often interposed objections when it came sullivans turn 
to interrogate mcfarlane keker turned the tables and the two argued 
calm down both of you said us district judge gerhard a 
gesell 
mcfarlanes testimony devoted mostly to aid given to the contras 
at a time when it was forbidden by us law also touched on the 
revelation that money from the sale of arms to iran had been 
diverted to the contra cause 
testifying about the events in late 1986 when details were 
emerging mcfarlane said north told him on the night of nov 18 that 
government lawyers believed there might be a problem with a 
shipment of 18 us hawk antiaircraft missiles from israel to iran a 
year earlier he had gone to norths office because the aide asked 
for his help in preparing a chronology for investigators and for a 
statement thenpresident reagan was to deliver the next night at a 
news conference 
the central intelligence agency had helped arrange the missile 
shipment and the prossible problem was whether or not the 
involvement of the cia was appropriate or properly executed 
mcfarlane said 
according to north he and i hadnt learned of this shipment 
until later on he wasnt certain about it mcfarlane said 
adding that at the time other american officials believed the 
material being shipped was oildrilling equipment 
mcfarlane had been told about the shipment in november 1985 when 
he was in geneva but said that a year later i had no clear 
recollection of it and thus used norths comments as the basis for 
the chronology 
one of the accusations against north is that he obstructed 
congress by saying in the final version of the chronology that no 
one in the us government learned before january 1986 that hawk 
missiles had been shipped to iran in november 1985 
mcfarlane also testified that on a car ride to the white house on 
nov 21 1986 north said were going to have a shredding party 
he agreed with keker that north probably referred to hundreds of 
documents including memos spelling out norths involvement in the 
contra aid efforts 
mcfarlane agreed under crossexamination by sullivan that north 
wrote only two paragraphs of a sept 5 1985 letter to hamilton a 
letter in connection with which north is accused of making false 
statements to congress 
but he also said much of norths thinking as submitted to 
mcfarlane in a draft of the letter was incorporated in the final 
version 
the draft said that national security council staffers did not 
solicit funds or other support for the contras and didnt offer 
tactical advice to the contras 
mcfarlane also testified that he didnt know whether north 
prepared a subsequent letter to thenrep michael barnes for which 
north also is accused of making false statements to congress 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to withholding information from congress 
in connection with the letter to barnes 
did you know they are charging ollie north in connection with 
the barnes letter asked sullivan 
no responded mcfarlane 
all you know is that you wrote it 
yes 
sullivan also brought out that north proposed letters to congress 
saying that executive privilege was being invoked and that the nsc 
would not turn over documents that barnes was requesting on norths 
contrarelated activities 
mcfarlane said he had an nsc lawyer consult with the white house 
counsels office which rejected norths idea sullivan brought up 
the matter to suggest that north wanted to refuse to respond to 
congress rather than provide it with information that might be wrong

air force investigators are looking at 
everything from weather to maintenance and weight to determine why a 
helicopter crashed and seem to have ruled out only nightvision 
goggles a spokesman said tuesday 
all 15 aboard died in sunday nights crash in the desert 25 miles 
northwest of davismonthan air force base where the helicopter had 
stopped to refuel 
authorities said the main rotor shaft nut a fastener about a 
foot in diameter that holds the main rotor head to the helicopter 
frame had been replaced two days before the crash although that 
wasnt thought to have been a factor in the crash it wasnt ruled 
out officials said 
investigators have tried to look at all the different aspects 
all of the potential variables things like weather things like 
maintenance fuel said capt carlos roque a spokesman at 
davismonthan 
roque said the only possible cause that has been ruled out is the 
use of controversial nightvision goggles which have been an issue 
in numerous military helicopter crashes 
officials have confirmed that when the ch3e helicopter went down 
in flames its four crew members were wearing the lightamplifying 
goggles as they ferried 11 army special forces members from an army 
post southeast of tucson to an air force gunnery range 124 miles 
northwest 
the soldiers whose names were not released immediately were 
from fort bragg nc 
authorities at davismonthan were gathering medical and dental 
records of the 15 victims to aid in identification of the badly 
burned bodies a temporary morgue was set up in advance of the 
arrival of a forensic team 
navy cmdr david thomas in washington said more than 300 ch3es 
and similar helicopters belonging to the air force navy and coast 
guard were grounded for a week that ended friday to inspect the 
rotor nut 
lt col darrel hayes an air force spokesman at the pentagon 
said the nuts were considered potentially defective he said the 
helicopter that went down had been inspected friday and its nut 
replaced and that it was flown safely three times before the crash 
as we understand it when they replaced the rotor nut they had 
done a flight test on it then rechecked it retorqued it and it 
has all sorts of special safety pins on it to keep it in place and 
then it had flown three times since then hayes said 
so it wasnt as if it was something they just did and it 
broke hayes added he said that while maintenance always is an 
issue in a crash it just doesnt fit with what we know 
on monday officials at davismonthan imposed an indefinite 
restriction on the five remaining ch3es belonging to the 71st 
special operations command 
at some point they will be permitted to fly again after 
something is done probably an inspection or a changeover of some 
sort or whatever the investigators recommend roque said right 
now its indefinite but its not permanent

south korea began major joint military 
maneuvers with the united states on tuesday and charged that north 
korea was preparing for war 
a defense ministry statement said the communist north was 
fomenting antiamericanism in south korea to force out us troops 
as part of its plot to conquer the country 
villagers forced a military range used by us fighter jets to 
close for a second day tuesday as about 200000 south korean and 
us troops plus naval and air units began 10 days of annual 
military games codenamed team spirit 
the demonstrators protesting practice bombing by the jets 
hurled rocks and firebombs onto koonni range about 70 miles 
southwest of seoul inflicting minor fire damage on three 
guardhouses a us military spokesman said 
the defense ministry statement rejected the norths charges that 
team spirit exercises were preparations for a nuclear attack on the 
north 
south korean defense officials said tuesday the exercises are 
defensive and pose no threat to the north 
the pyongyang regime put its armed forces on combat alert and 
mobilized reserves as it has done during previous exercises it 
warned on monday that the maneuvers could trigger war 
the tension between the north and the south has been screwed up 
to the highest pitch and a dangerous situation has been created on 
the korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment said 
pyongyangs official korean central news agency 
the south said the north should immediately stop its 
continuous military buildup and war preparations and clearly show 
that it is giving up its strategy of communizing the south by 
force 
south korean officials said pyongyang was trying to stir up 
antiamerican sentiment among some south koreans to try to force 
removal of the 42000 us troops based here under a mutual defense 
treaty 
we are compelled to point out the norths scheme to 
heighten antiamericanism and get american troops out and 
eventually realize revolution to communize the south the defense 
ministry statement said 
some groups in the south including dissidents radical students 
and farmers have become increasingly antiamerican because of us 
trade pressure and they see the united states as having supported 
authoritarian regimes 
this years team spirit involves about 70000 american troops 
including the 42000 stationed here and 27000 from hawaii okinawa 
and the us mainland according to a us military spokesman in 
seoul 
like the other us military spokesman he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the north cited team spirit earlier as impeding northsouth 
talks and those peace talks have been stalled 
the peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
capitalist prowestern south korea at the end of world war ii when 
us and soviet troops ended japans colonial rule over the region 
the two koreas have remained bitter enemies and fought a war from

mexico is turning away truckloads of live hogs 
at the border because the animals have not been vaccinated for a 
disease eradicated in the united states sen lloyd bentsen said 
tuesday 
the texas democrat said the mexican ban of usbred hogs was 
imposed with litte or no warning has no basis in scientific 
fact and may be based on mistaken information 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee said he was 
asking us trade representative carla hills and agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter to negotiate an end to the problem 
bentsens office said mexico began turning away us hogs friday 
he said mexico is barring the hog imports because the animals 
have not been vaccinated for hog cholera which has been eradicated 
from the united states for over a decade 
in fact it is illegal under us law to vaccinate hogs against 
hog cholera and since the hogs in question are market hogs destined 
for slaughter such a vaccination would be moot in any case said 
bentsen 
pat elhinnaway a spokeswoman at the agriculture department 
said the agency just received official notification from mexico 
about the ban we are in the process of translating it from 
spanish and analyzing it

intends to plead insanity his attorney told a judge tuesday 
the furlough program was suspended after the killing 
alan l matheney 38 stood silently during the hearing in st 
joseph superior court while his courtappointed attorney filed a 
series of motions 
for his protection matheney was transferred from the st joseph 
county jail where he was assaulted march 6 to the indiana state 
prison at michigan city said defense attorney philip r skodinski 
the assault is under investigation 
judge jeanne j swartz accepted the insanity notice and said she 
would appoint two psychiatrists to examine matheney and determine 
his competency to stand trial june 19 
matheneys furlough raised a public furor prompting gov evan 
bayh to suspend the program and to order seven prison officials to 
face disciplinary hearings 
matheney had been serving an eightyear sentence for beating his 
exwife lisa m bianco and criminally confining her two daughters 
ms bianco was beaten to death march 4 outside her mishawaka home 
by a man wielding an unloaded shotgun she died of a massive skull 
fracture a coroner said 
prison officials failed to notify ms bianco 29 of matheneys 
release hours before the assault despite her requests and 
matheneys continued hostility toward her according to a board of 
correction report released monday 
prosecutor michael p barnes said he would decide later this week 
whether to seek the death penalty matheney also is charged with 
burglary 
at the hearing matheney asked the prosecutors for recordings of 
telephone conversations between ms bianco and matheney made before 
his imprisonment skodinski said he didnt know what information the 
tapes contained but said they might help the defense 
chief deputy prosecutor john d krisor said the recordings 
apparently were related to the 1987 battery case against matheney 
krisor said he did not know if the prosecutors office had the tapes 
ms bianco had divorced matheney in 1985 and last year became a 
counselor for battered women at the elkhart county womens shelter 
she also joined the mishawaka commission on the status of women 
hours before the slaying officials at the industrial 
correctional complex at pendleton gave matheney an eighthour 
furlough to confer with an attorney in indianapolis 
matheney should have been restricted to the indianapolis area 
about 40 southwest of pendleton and 160 miles south of mishawaka 
but that condition did not appear on his furlough pass according 
the correction board report 
seven officials from the department of correction were ordered to 
face disciplinary hearings after the report blamed bureaucratic 
ineptitude and poor decision making for matheneys release

the government said tuesday that social 
tension caused by economic hardship could threaten agreements 
reached in negotiations with the political opposition which began 
feb 6 and are nearing completion 
the social effects of economic phenomena may be dangerous 
government spokesman jerzy urban said inflation difficulties in 
acquiring goods and regulating incomes by strikes may undermine 
the national agreements and evoke disturbances and crisis 
situations 
urban cited strikes led by extremist elements that briefly 
idled four mines tuesday in jastrzebie last august a nationwide 
series of strikes that began in the southern city prompted 
authorities to propose the talks on political and economic reform 
alojzy pietrzyk of jastrzebie a solidarity negotiator in the 
talks said the latest warning strikes were prompted by the 
refusal of management to pay annual bonuses to workers who struck in 
august 
solidarity has made frequent statements saying strikes are 
unfavorable for the country at the moment pietrzyk said in a 
statement at the same time we state that strikes can be avoided 
only by reaching an agreement which would satisfy work forces at 
mines and implementing it as soon as possible 
government and opposition negotiators have agreed in principle to 
restore legal status to the independent union solidarity the 
farmers union rural solidarity and the independent students 
association all were formed in 1980 and outlawed after martial law 
was imposed in december 1981 
negotiators also have announced agreement on free elections to a 
newly created senate 
anger over low wages has led to several strikes in recent months 
but urban said the frequency of strikes had declined in the past 
week 
economic problems besetting poland include annual inflation of at 
least 60 percent and a foreign debt of more than 38 billion 
most stores are short of goods or stocked with items of poor 
quality so many poles part with precious hard currency at staterun 
dollar shops or make shopping trips abroad 
poland has to go through a difficult preliminary period in the 
upcoming year of the transition stage the economy will decide about 
everything urban said 
he said it appeared government estimates that 1989 inflation 
would be kept to 20 percent were too optimistic and difficult 
revolutionary economic steps lie ahead 
under discussion at the talks is an opposition proposal on 
indexing wages to inflation which the government has said would 
make matters worse 
urban said failure of the dialogue would be a historic tragedy 
for the nation the failure of this experiment would not only 
destroy the hopes of poles but also polands position in the 
world

president bush said friday he would issue a new 
executive order spelling out ethical standards of conduct expected 
of highranking government officials 
bush said that while he might not accept all of the changes 
advocated by a presidential study panel i will be moving quickly 
to seek implementation of the great bulk of the commissions 
recommendations 
after meeting privately with members of the commission headed by 
former federal judge malcolm wilkey bush issued a statement saying 
that upholding exacting ethical standards throughout the 
government is extremely important to me and to all americans 
he reiterated that he also will soon propose legislation 
the house and senate last year passed a bill aimed at attacking 
the revolvingdoor problem in which people leave government 
positions and then lobby the agencies where they used to work 
thenpresident reagan vetoed the bill saying it would discourage 
people from going into the service of their country 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
certainly agrees with a commission recommendation that would 
treat the executive office of the president as a single agency for 
purposes of ethics rules the aim of this change would be to stop 
former white house employees from attempting to use their influence 
as lobbyists with separate entities in the executive office complex 
the standard presidential executive order on ethics has gone 
unchanged since it was issued by lyndon b johnson in 1965

terrorist fawaz younis lured to his arrest on 
the high seas with promises of sex and drugs was convicted tuesday 
in us district court of hijacking a jordanian airliner in beirut 
and holding 70 people hostage for 30 hours 
federal officials immediately claimed the verdict as the first 
affirmation of a 1984 statute asserting for the united states 
longarm jurisdiction over the taking of american hostages 
aboard 
attorney general dick thornburgh hailed the verdict as a boost 
for our efforts to effectively deal with international terrorism 
those who violate the rights of us citizens are hereby put on 
notice that the american law enforcement system is capable of 
exacting a penalty for these terroristic crimes regardless of where 
they occur thornburgh said in a statement 
the lebanese younis bearded and with black hair showed no 
emotion as a female interpreter relayed the verdict the jury reached 
after three days of deliberations guilty on three counts innocent 
on three others 
while the jury of seven women and five men filed out of the 
courtroom younis chatted with the arabic interpretor and appeared 
relaxed and smiling 
for his conviction on the most serious offense taking hostages 
the 30yearold younis could be sentenced to life in prison 
this case demonstrates the determination of the united states 
government to bring to justice in the united states international 
terrorists who victimize us citizens wherever violence and 
hostagetaking acts are committed us attorney jay b stephens 
said in a statement 
younis courtappointed attorney francis d carter contested 
the government claim and said he would appeal the conviction on 
grounds that the united states ought not to have jurisdiction over 
the 1985 hijacking he said he also would appeal on grounds the 
military was involved in the arrest 
it is an outrage said carter the case was not about the 
united states and the two americans aboard the aircraft were not 
harmed 
younis was lured aboard a yacht in international waters in the 
mediterranean sea on sept 13 1987 with the prospect of a drug 
deal and a party 
he was slammed to the deck by members of the fbi hostage rescue 
squad and interrogated for four days aboard a navy munitions ship 
then after he gave a detailed confession he was flown nonstop 
from the deck of an aircraft carrier to washington 
doctors later found he had suffered hairline fractures of both 
wrists during the arrest but during his interrogation the swelling 
was treated only with bags of ice 
mr younis did not expect an awful lot from the united states 
after the means used to arrest him carter said 
i tried to prepare him and told him that an american jury was 
probably not likely for an acquittal in this case carter said 
he was not too hopeful 
he was happy that on three counts he was found not guilty and 
those three counts were the horribles harming or threatening 
passengers destroying an aircraft and carrying weapons aboard an 
aircraft said carter 
younis was convicted on these counts 
seizing hostages with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment 
conspiracy to commit sky piracy with a maximum sentence of five 
years 
hijacking a commercial airliner with a maximum 20 years in 
prison 
he was found innocent on these counts 
using or threatening violence against passengers or crew members 
of a commercial airliner 
destroying a civilian aircraft 
carrying aboard a civilian aircraft devices likely to damage it 
carter had argued that younis should be acquitted because he 
hijacked the aircraft under orders from lebanons amal militia a 
shiite moslem group to which he had belonged since 1979 
younis testified that he knew hijacking a civilian airliner was 
illegal but said amal was at war 
but he acknowledged under crossexamination that amal was not at 
war with any of the passengers or crew with royal jordanian 
airlines or the government of jordan 
judge aubrey e robinson jr instructed the jury that 
hijacking a plane is illegal obeying illegal orders is 
not a defense 
to find the defendant innocent on grounds that he was obeying 
orders said robinson the jury would have to conclude he did not 
know hijacking was illegal 
a federal appeals court has already ruled the arrest of younis 
while not a model of law enforcement was acceptable and that the 
confession could be used in court against him 
carter said he expected the the judge to issue a sentence in 30 
to 45 days and said that he would be reviewing the record of the 
trial to determine whether there were further gounds for appeal 
a federal appeals court has already ruled that the arrest while 
not a model of law enforcement was acceptable and that a written 
confession signed by younis could be used against him closing that 
avenue of appeal 
during the trial five eyewitnesses identified younis as the 
leader of the hijacking prosecutors played a videotape of him at 
the end of the incident announcing that the hijackers planned to 
destroy the aircraft

the bush administration sent conflicting 
signals tuesday about the amount of nonmilitary aid it will seek to 
keep the nicaraguan contra rebels afloat until a peace agreement is 
carried out 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said a total of 40 
million to 50 million quoted in news stories this week is in 
the ballpark of what president bush wants to follow after the 
current 27 million package expires march 31 
but on capitol hill secretary of state james a baker iii said 
that figure is not an accurate number as far as im concerned 
baker commented on the contras at a budget hearing before the 
house appropriations foreign operations subcommittee 
later fitzwater later said he agreed with baker and that his 
comment about the numbers being in the ballpark merely reflected 
that its a big ballpark encompassing all figures 
fitzwater said no final decision has been made on bushs proposal 
and we are not setting artificial timetables for decisions 
baker and fitzwater agreed a money request will be sent to 
congress for nonlethal assistance to the contra forces that are 
about 11000 contras in camps on the honduras side of the border 
with leftistruled nicaragua 
rebel leader adolfo calero said administration officials told him 
the aid request would be in the neighborhood of 40 million which 
would be intended to see the rebels into early 1990 when nicaraguan 
national elections are to occur 
fitzwater reiterated the administrations intent for a diplomatic 
solution and said bushs plan would include the ideas of 
incentives and disincentives that might go with that 
in this approach we are also pursuing the building of a 
bipartisan support for whatever policy emerges he said in 
highlighting the administrations wish to work out some kind of aid 
package that can make it through the democraticcontrolled congress 
contra aid has been a highly contentious issue for six years 
fitzwater also acknowledged that a key factor will be the 
cooperation of honduras in allowing the contras to keep their camps 
he noted that undersecretary of state robert kimmitt visited 
honduran president jose azcona on monday to discuss the situation 
and us policy 
a delegation of honduran officials breaking a ban on talks with 
the contras met with calero and a group of rebel leaders in 
washington on monday 
afterward the hondurans were uncustomarily conciliatory in 
comments about the contras declining to repeat previous honduran 
demands that the rebels be expelled from honduran territory 
baker said the effort to maintain the antisandinista contras in 
place represents a genuine view that they do represent somewhat of 
an incentive for the sandinista government to keep the promises they 
havent kept in the past including steps toward democratization 
and civil liberties he said 
the five central american presidents agreed last month in el 
salvador to construct a plan by this spring for the disbanding of 
the rebels in exchange for democratic reforms in nicaragua 
administration officials have said their concern is to keep the 
contras in place until it can be assured the sandinistas will keep 
their pledges regarding democracy moves 
us officials have said bush is prepared to ease the us trade 
embargo against nicaragua and take a number of other conciliatory 
measures if the sandinistas show they are serious about holding fair 
elections next year 
under such circumstances the administration also would be 
prepared to upgrade diplomatic relations with nicaragua including 
the exchange of ambassadors the officials said 
the administration has prepared a list of about 20 incentives for 
nicaragua as well as a potential list of punitive measures of 
similar length if nicaraguan opposition forces are not given what 
us officials perceive to be an equal chance in the balloting

a supreme court justice tuesday refused to let 
a strike against eastern airlines spread to a philadelphiaarea 
commuter railroad that carries 90000 passengers a day 
justice william j brennan left intact a court order blocking a 
sympathy strike by the railroad workers in support of the machinists 
union strike against eastern 
brennan rejected a request by rail unions seeking to strike the 
southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa 
he said the rail unions failed to establish that there is a 
reasonable probability four justices on the high court would vote to 
hear arguments in the case one of the grounds that could have been 
the basis for suspending the lower court order 
us district judge franklin van antwerpen in philadelphia issued 
a preliminary injunction on march 9 prohibiting the rail unions from 
honoring pickets set up by eastern machinists at septa facilities 
van antwerpen said it takes little imagination to project the 
harm and danger which would immediately flow from the cessation of 
90000 passenger rail trips each day 
a similar court order in new york city has prevented the eastern 
strike from spreading to commuter railroads in the new york 
metropolitan region 
the eastern airlines machinists are said to be trying to use such 
sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts to prompt president bush or 
congress to take action in the walkout against the airline 
the threatened disruption of the nations transportation system 
could pressure bush into appointing a special board to mediate the 
dispute during a 60day coolingoff period congress also has the 
power to impose a settlement recommended by such a board 
the machinists union said that sympathy strikes rarely used in 
the transportation industry are legal under the railway labor act 
of 1926 
the supreme court ruled in 1987 that courts may not bar rail 
workers from extending a labor dispute to other railroads not 
directly involved in the dispute 
but septa officials said contracts with their workers require 
that disputes be ironed out through arbitration 
the officials said the strike is prohibited by septas contract 
with its workers and because the railway labor act bars strike over 
minor disputes 
judge van antwerpen in issuing the injunction against the 
railway workers ordered the unions and septa to proceed to 
arbitration 
meanwhile the bush administration reiterated its opposition 
tuesday to legislation that would require the president to appoint 
an emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout the house 
is scheduled to consider the bill wednesday 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner released a letter he 
had sent monday to house members warning them the president 
strongly opposes this bill and his senior advisors would recommend 
that he veto this or any similar bill 
the administration says it believes there is no emergency that 
would justify the appointment of such a board and that even if one 
were named easterns management and workers are so bitter that 
little would be accomplished 
congressional supporters mainly democrats say the board might 
help the two sides reach an agreement the measure is expected to 
pass the house but it is considered largely symbolic because of its 
questionable fate in the senate and bushs likely veto

the singer company and a former subsidiary were 
accused by the government tuesday in a 231 million lawsuit of 
fraudulently inflating the price of military aircraft flight 
simulators 
the suit filed by the justice department charged that singer co 
and link flight simulation corp fabricated higher cost estimates 
to offset price concessions they might be forced to make during 
contract negotiations with the defense department 
the action was taken in a false claims act lawsuit originally 
filed under seal last fall in us district court in baltimore by 
christopher urda a former link flight price administrator 
the amended complaint filed by the justice department supersedes 
the original suit filed by urda and taxpayers against fraud 
under the civil warera false claims act private citizens may 
sue on behalf of the government if they suspect fraud the 
government is empowered to take over the case if it determines that 
the original claims have merit 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said the 231 million 
claimed by the government made the case one of the largest suits 
brought under the false claims act 
urdas complaint which was ordered unsealed by us district 
judge herbert murray at the governments request had accused singer 
of arbitrarily adding a 10 percent labor charge onto original 
estimates for the flight simulators over a 15year period 
but the governments amended complaint only alleged price fraud 
on seven contracts between 1983 and 1986 on flight simulators and

kurt vonnegut and other us writers on 
tuesday urged the security council to protect salman rushdie from a 
death sentence issued by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for alleged 
blasphemy in his book the satanic verses 
but it appeared highly unlikely the council would champion 
rushdies cause and antagonize iran which has agreed to 
unmediated peace talks in its war with iraq 
pen the association of poets essayists and novelists the 
national writers union the authors guild the human rights group 
article 19 and other authors groups presented petitions to 
britain canada and other members of the 15nation council tuesday 
and asked them to take up the case as an issue of free speech 
the petition signed by more than 1500 writers worldwide 
urgently requests the council to intervene in the rushdie affair for 
humanitarian reasons 
a delegation of authors met british and canadian envoys tuesday 
and planned to meet with french finnish colombian us and 
yugoslavian representatives they also sought meetings with all 
other members of the most powerful un body 
so far only malaysia a largely moslem nation has declined a 
meeting the authors said but council members algeria and senegal 
also moslem were expected to decline 
british mission spokesman j stephen smith told reporters later 
that britain initially had considered taking the matter to the 
council but ultimately concluded it was preferable to take action 
through diplomatic channels 
western diplomats added that with three moslem members the 
council could not possibly agree on a statement or action strong 
enough to satisfy many western nations 
council members also think the rushdie issue is primarily a 
religious not a political case and is not the appropriate topic 
for council consideration western diplomats said 
the council already has declined to take up the rushdie case 
because the body does not want to offend iran and jeopardize the 
delicate unmediated iraniraq peace talks 
but the authors and human rights activists who began a 36hour 
vigil across the street from here said their intention was to 
publicize the issue 
the council includes five permanent members with veto power the 
united states britain china france and the soviet union and 10 
other members algeria brazil canada colombia denmark ethiopia 
malaysia nepal senegal yugoslavia 
last month khomeini ordered moslems to murder rushdie on grounds 
his book insulted islam rushdie an indianborn british citizen is 
in hiding 
the british government defended rushdie and the tehran government 
broke its recently restored diplomatic relations with london 
the delegation and demonstrators included vonnegut philip 
caputo william styron alix kates shulman nat hentoff victor 
navasky national writers union president alec dubro publisher rick 
macarthur of article 19 exiled south african poet dennis brutus 
and chilean author ariel dorfman 
in stirling scotland british commonwealth secretarygeneral sir 
shridath ramphal said writers condemning the death threat against 
rushdie had spoken for the rest of the world 
he said the call for rushdies murder had understandably and 
rightly produced a wave of adverse reaction throughout the 
commonwealth the 48member organization of britain and its former 
colonies 
the worlds writers have more than given a lead in this matter 
i believe they have spoken for the world community in its 
collectivity ramphal told an audience at stirling university

defense secretarydesignate dick cheney 
cautioned tuesday against any us reductions in military strength 
in response to changes in the soviet union as the senate armed 
services committee opened hearings on president bushs replacement 
for john tower 
it would be a great mistake to reduce our own military 
capabilities and lessen our defense posture the sixterm wyoming 
congressman told the committee 
cheney used his first day before the panel to expound on his 
views of defense policy including his stand on star wars and 
burdensharing as committee members indicated they will move 
quickly on confirmation 
im delighted with this nomination said sen james exon of 
nebraska second ranking democrat on the panel i hope this 
confirmation goes quickly and i believe it will 
added sen ted kennedy dmass i look forward to working with 
him and i expect his rapid and overwhelming confirmation americas 
defense policy is back on track 
coming after a bitter senate debate over the tower nomination 
the first day of consideration of cheneys nomination was marked by 
strong words of praise sentimentality and indications of support 
from both parties 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo a member of the armed services 
panel said cheneys sense of humility and a sense of presence 
served him well and will serve america well 
senate republican whip alan simpson of wyoming called the 
congressman the most steady and unflappable man i have ever known 
and he will need it all 
the republican senator also took a swipe at the rancorous senate 
battle that claimed tower as a victim saying the process can be 
quite demeaning and quite dehumanizing 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman said the panel 
agreed with the white house to do what we could this week on the 
nomination but added that they would not be taking any 
shortcuts 
the georgia democrat said quick action on the nomination would be 
determined by the speed with which the committee receives the 
necessary information on cheney the panel is still awaiting letters 
from the white house and pentagon counsels on cheneys financial 
record and the fbi background check 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater was asked 
when the fbi checks would be finished 
theyre trying to move those as rapidly as possible i 
dont have a specific date he said 
the committee has received the requested tax returns a statement 
from cheneys doctors and a completed committee questionnaire 
house republican leader bob michel one of those introducing 
cheney to the committee saying he recommended the nomination with a 
combination of pride and regret 
and cheney himself conceded the decision to leave the house was 
wrenching 
im here not because i sought the job but because the president 
asked me to take on a difficult assignment the nominee told the 
committee 
cheney said the top priorities for the defense department will be 
personnel changes a general review of strategy and the budget 
he said he supports a defense budget that would be approved for a 
twoyear period instead of one year as is customary an argument 
pentagon officials say will build stability into the weaponsbuying 
process 
questioned by sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on 
the committee cheney said he was once skeptical of the changes in 
the soviet union by president mikhail s gorbachev who has shown a 
willingness to negotiate on arms cuts and promoted his policy of 
openness called glasnost and reforms known as perestroika 
cheney said he believes that the kremlin leader thinks the status 
quo is unacceptable 
however the united states should continue to pursue an 
aggressive agenda on arms control and not reduce its military 
commitments he said the soviets according to cheney are sincere 
in seeking arms controls 
but he noted that in the west the perception of change will 
exceed the reality 
on other defense issues 
the wyoming congressman said that in the past he has been a 
strong supporter of the strategic defense initiative commonly known 
as star wars the pentagon is currently conducting a strategic and 
budget review that will have a major impact on star wars spending 
asked about the spending level cheney said thats an open 
question 
on the question of burdensharing by us allies cheney said 
the united states should encourage japan and western europe to spend 
more on defense but the us argument should be that the additional 
money is required for our common defense 
cheney said donald atwood has agreed to accept his nomination 
as deputy secretary of defense atwood had been chosen by bush when 
tower was nominated 
in response to concerns about his health cheney submitted a 
letter from his cardiologist dr allan m ross of the george 
washington university medical center describing the congressmans 
medical history and treatment 
the 48yearold cheney underwent coronary bypass surgery last 
summer and has had three heart attacks 
the congressman is presently fit to accept any position 
requiring the highest intellectual behavior and physical 
performance said ross who has treated cheney since september 
1985 
questioned by warner about his two draft deferments during the 
early stage of the vietnam war cheney said he requested and 
obtained the first deferment because of his academic work and sought 
the second because he was married with a small child 
i would have been happy to serve if i had been called cheney 
said 
the answers the congressman provided to the committee met with 
praise and even nunn left little doubt as to the final outcome of 
the confirmation process telling cheney that reports on strategy 
and weapons the committee had sought from the pentagon could be 
pushed back if you need more time 
as wallop left the hearing he told cheneys wife lynne and 
their two teenage daughters mary and elizabeth pretty smooth 
the selection last week of cheney a former white house chief of 
staff in the ford administration who moved up in the house to the 
no 2 gop spot was met with praise 
swift action has been promised by the committee and senate 
leadership in marked contrast to the lengthy debate and bitter 
partisan dispute over towers alleged excessive drinking and 
womanizing and his work as a paid defense consultant after he left 
the senate 
bush named cheney to the pentagon post last friday one day after 
the senate rejected tower by a 5347 vote 
as the stage shifts to cheney the administration and congress 
are already working on what will be the next defense secretarys top 
priority bushs proposed defense budget for fiscal 1990 which cuts 
64 billion from former president reagans plan of 3056 billion 
william h taft iv the deputy defense secretary who has been 
running the pentagon and adm william j crowe jr chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff urged the senate budget committee on tuesday 
to seek a consensus with the administration on spending 
we have been on a rollercoaster monthtomonth as congress is 
reviewing programs and changing them said taft who bemoaned the 
fact that the nations security is being guided by mathematics

cambodias three resistance movements moved toward 
a unified fighting force tuesday by forming a defense council led by 
prince norodom sihanouk the former ruler turned rebel leader 
a joint statement from him and the other leaders who often have 
been at odds also announced a common political program 
envisioning western democracy and free enterprise after a 
vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia vietnam invaded in december 
1978 
amnesty international urged cambodias vietnambacked government 
to furnish information about hundreds of political prisoners it says 
were not freed under an amnesty proclaimed last may a statement 
issued in paris said amnesty has names of more than 400 including 
some arrested 10 years ago who have not been charged or tried 
sihanouk said all rebel forces now are practically under my 
command the prince who lives in beijing part of the year serves 
as president of the cambodian governmentinexile formed by the 
three movements 
he announced plans for the high council for national defense 
together with his partners in the resistance government communist 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan and son sann who heads a smaller 
noncommunist party 
they have met privately in the chinese capital since sunday to 
discuss cambodias future in light of a chinesesoviet summit 
planned for may and the vietnamese rejection of sihanouks peace 
proposals 
the prince said he was confident china will not drop its support 
of the cambodian resistance to reach agreement with the soviets on a 
speedy vietnamese withdrawal moscow is vietnams main ally 
i am 100 percent sure china will continue to support my plan 
and support us sihanouk said a vietnamese withdrawal that leaves 
the hanoisponsored government of hun sen to confront the resistance 
a la afghanistan is not acceptable he declared 
soviet troops finished withdrawing from afghanistan on feb 15 
after nine years of involvement in the communist governments war 
with moslem guerrillas 
sihanouk predicted president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet 
union and deng xiaoping the senior chinese leader will agree at 
the summit to exert pressure on behalf of the princes plan 
it calls for un supervision of a vietnamese withdrawal and free 
elections under a provisional government of all parties 
vietnam has said it will withdraw by september if a political 
agreement is reached but promised to leave in 1990 in any case 
a major obstacle to sihanouks plan is the refusal of vietnam and 
hun sen to accept un supervision and khmer rouge participation in 
a future government 
the united states which helps the resistance also has been wary 
of a return to power by the khmer rouge which gained control in 
1975 under the leadership of pol pot at least 1 million people had 
died in a reign of terror by the time vietnam invaded 
pol pot is said to have retired and sihanouk said khieu samphan 
had agreed the former leader would remain out of the picture 
if they break their promise my army will fight them 
indefinitely the prince said turning to khieu samphan the khmer 
rouge leader smiling broadly said his party would accept 
realities in order to end the occupation 
much of the conflict within the alliance has arisen because of 
the khmer rouge sihanouk has accused its forces of repeated attacks 
on his army but told the news conference tuesday no attacks had 
occurred in several months 
he said one of the defense councils duties would be to resolve 
such conflicts the joint statement said the council would ensure 
solidarity cooperation and mutual respect and assistance among 
the three armies

meatpacking plant where he worked 
police said they arrested six men immediately after the murder 
and were questioning them 
thomas hardy 48 who had a wife and two sons was shot at 
granville meat in dungannon county tyrone a police spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity hardy was a parttime member of the 
ulster defense regiment the locally recruited wing of the army 
the outlawed ira claimed responsibility in a statement to the 
british broadcasting corp in belfast it has made security forces a 
target in its 20yearold campaign to drive britain from 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the irish 
republic which is overwhelmingly roman catholic 
police said they found a car abandoned about 500 yards from the 
plant and there was a twocar accident 1 miles farther on three 
people were arrested at the accident scene and three others near the 
shooting scene police said 
on tuesday night police reported two more violent incidents 
a bomb exploded and shots were fired as a police vehicle passed 
andersonstown road in mainly catholic west belfast the car was not 
damaged but two girls who were passing suffered from shock and were 
taken to a hospital 
in cookstown county tyrone a bomb exploded in a hedge about 50 
yards from a car police were told had a supicious device inside 
officers were evacuating the area when the bomb went off and no one

reprimanded over allegations that the northern ireland force 
illegally shot six unarmed catholics to death in 1982 
another was cautioned and charges were dismissed against a 20th 
man said a statement from the royal ulster constabulary the 
provincial police force 
five of the dead were acknowledged ira guerrillas but the sixth 
was a teenager not involved in the sectarian conflict 
the affair has been a sore point with catholics and britains 
decision to hold a disciplinary inquiry and not prosecute angered 
the irish government in dublin 
all six victims were catholics killed in three incidents over a 
threeweek period allegations arose that a shoottokill policy was 
in effect but the police denied it 
allegations of a coverup were revived in 1986 when john stalker 
a police officer from england sent over to investigate the killings 
was forced off the case he claimed that happened because he was 
close to proving a murder conspiracy 
two senior officers were suspended and have since resigned on 
health grounds 
the 20 officers were not identified but nearly all were 
sergeants or constables the british domestic news agency press 
association reported it said they were accused of breaches of 
discipline of a relatively minor nature

former justice minister jose eugenio 
jacquet an aide to ousted president gen alfredo stroessner was 
brought to court tuesday on corruption charges 
in another development opposition leader domingo laino said the 
electoral board was hindering efforts to register voters and he 
questioned the integrity of national elections set for may 1 to 
replace stroessner 
a criminal lawsuit charges five stroessner cabinet members and 
seven members of his government or the ruling colorado party with 
crimes against public administration including embezzlement 
bribery and fraud 
stroessner flew to exile in neighboring brazil following the feb 
3 coup led by gen andres rodriguez former interior minister sabino 
montanaro was given conditional asylum in honduras but he may be 
called back to face charges 
a police report accused jacquet of selling licenses to notaries 
and court clerks for 4000 each and an audit of the labor and 
justice ministry turned up 157 planilleros or payrollers 
people who showed up only to cash their checks each month 
jacquet also pressured judges to rule on cases according to his 
instructions which resulted in important economic gains the 
police report conducted after the coup alleged 
jacquets attorney ramon alberto aquino said the charges were 
vague he did not say how his client pleaded if at all the 
defendants were called to court for formal notification of the 
charges against them and to answer questions from the judge they 
were not obliged to respond to the charges 
among the cabinet members former education minister carlos ortiz 
ramirez was accused of creating ghost employees on his agencys 
payrolls and pocketing their salaries when their checks went 
uncollected 
laino meanwhie said the 9member electoral board had provided 
only about five voter registration books for every 100 he requested 
his authentic radical liberal party the largest opposition group 
has not yet decided whether to contest or boycott the elections 
the facts we have now give us the right to doubt just how clean 
and transparent the elections they want us to participate in will 
be laino told a news conference 
the government reopened registration lists for an additional 
month on march 1 the electoral board dominated by members of the 
ruling colorado party argues that some 80 percent of all eligible 
voters are already registered 
laino said the figures used by the board are bloated from 
electoral fraud on the part of the stroessner government he added 
that independent analysts place the number of unregistered eligible 
voters in paraguay at 35 percent 
in elections last year according to official figures by the 
electoral board the number of votes surpassed the number of 
registered voters in 39 districts laino said even the dead and 
ghosts voted 
gen rodriguez is the presidential candidate of the colorado 
party which has been in power since 1947 and is widely expected to 
retain control of the presidency and congress

president bush on tuesday endorsed a treasury 
department plan urging partial forgiveness by commercial banks of 
outstanding third world debt 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush decided 
to back the plan advanced on friday by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady after an evening meeting of the national security council 
the president fully supports the concepts and processes for 
debt reduction and economic growth outlined by secretary brady 
fitzwater said 
bradys plan has as its central element the partial forgiveness 
by commercial banks of the 410 billion in debt run up by developing 
nations most of them in latin america 
it represents a major shift in administration thinking 
the reagan administration had argued against any writing off by 
banks of outstanding third world debt and adhered to a plan crafted 
by thentreasury secretary james a baker iii calling for new bank 
loans to countries enacting economic reforms 
fitzwater said that baker now the secretary of state was in 
full accord with the new socalled brady plan as was the 
federal reserve which reportedly had voiced earlier reservations 
bush until now had reserved judgment on the plan even though it 
had won wide international praise 
fitzwater cautioned that nothing should be read into the delay 
saying its just the way the process developed 
bradys plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding 
debt by using money from the world bank and the international 
monetary fund as collateral 
the plan also envisions some of the debt being swapped by banks 
for bonds of lower face value 
brady had revealed the proposal in a speech to a conference 
sponsored by the bretton woods committee a group which deals with 
international economic issues 
fitzwater said the president had not wanted to commit himself to 
the plan until the national security council had had a chance to 
meet on the proposal but told brady to make the speech anyway

queen elizabeth ii and her family got a pay 
increase in tuesdays annual budget of 46 percent which was lower 
than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers 106 
million 
the increase of 273000 pounds 466800 brought the total to 
6195300 pounds 10594000 and was too much for some labor 
party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living 
for the royal family it looks as though christmas has come 
early labor member max madden said in the house of commons 
an increase of 46 percent for the civil list as the royal 
allowances are known compares with annual inflation of 75 percent 
up from 33 percent a year ago 
members of the royal family are paid for carrying out such 
official duties as receiving ambassadors presenting awards opening 
hospitals visiting the armed forces and making foreign tours 
most of the money goes to salaries for the 350 royal household 
staff from private secretaries to coachmen gardeners and window 
cleaners at buckingham palace and the other royal residences 
queen elizabeth rich in in her own right will receive 465 
million pounds 796 million in the 198990 fiscal year up from 
455 million pounds 
her 88yearold mother queen mother elizabeth will get 404000 
pounds 691000 and prince philip her husband will be paid 
225300 pounds 385000 
the queens youngest son prince edward 25 who quit the royal 
marines and now works as a production assistant for a theater 
company run by composer andrew lloyd webber does not get a raise 
he has received 20000 pounds 34200 a year since 1982 
prince charles heir to the throne and his wife diana are not on 
the list because he is prince of wales and lives on income from the 
duchy of cornwall estates that amounted to 14 million pounds 24 
million last year 
the largest percentage raise was for the queens second son 
prince andrew duke of york a naval lieutenant on a destroyer his 
state allowance rises from 86500 pounds 148000 to 155400 
pounds nearly 266000 or more than 79 percent he also will get 
21000 pounds nearly 36000 in service pay plus allowances 
andrew has been accused of taking too much leave and not handling 
enough royal duties to justify his allowance 
madden called the raise a monster increase that would amaze 
and astonish most people who he said would not find much benefit 
for themselves in the budget 
andrews raise will pay for his office at buckingham palace 
established in 1986 when he married sarah ferguson now duchess of 
york their staff includes a private secretary a fulltime 
ladyinwaiting up to four clerks a chauffeur and a dresser to 
look after the duchesss clothes 
labor legislator chris mullin said the royal family should pay 
tax on their state grants and claimed the queen could afford it 
because she is one of the richest people in the world 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage said 
she pays the equivalent of 80 percent tax on the income from her 
estates and invested wealth double the top rate of her richest 
subjects 
the queen is the most heavily taxed person in britain he 
said and estimated royal revenues at 50 million pounds 855 
million a year of which the queen would retain 10 million pounds 
171 million 
that is the same as being taxed at 80 percent brooksbaker 
said 
in the time of king george iii in the 18th century he said 
monarchs found they could not live on their income and agreed to 
surrender all revenues in return for the civil list a sum 
parliament deemed sufficient for their needs 
each monarch since has opted for the civil list at the start of a 
new reign but because todays royal revenues are much greater than 
before the queen has been allowed to keep a portion brooksbaker 
said

turkeys highestranking military man 
declared the armys loyalty to turkish democracy on tuesday after 
the opposition expressed fear the military would intervene in a 
controversy over islamic headgear 
a constitutional court last week declared unconstitutional a 
parliamentary ruling that allowed moslem women to cover their heads 
while attending university classes with men 
moslem fundamentalists staged protest marches and the government 
of premier turgut ozal found itself in an increasingly uncomfortable 
situation during campaigning for march 26 local elections 
advocates of secularism see the headcover as a political symbol 
of those who want turkey to return to islamic laws as iran has 
tolerance for the fundamentalists angered some secular groups 
including turkeys elite and military leaders 
on sunday gen necip torumtay chief of staff of the armed 
forces paid a surprise visit to president kenan evren torumtay 
later told the istanbul daily cumhuriyet we are following the 
issue closely 
this led erdal inonu leader of the major opposition social 
democratic populist party to declare we are against a solution 
through military intervention we believe we can overcome these 
dangers within the democratic system 
turkeys armed forces staged coups in 1960 1971 and 1980 
on tuesday torumtay said in a written statement to news media 
the turkish armed forces knows its place and duties within 
the constitutional order and is a true believer in and loyal to 
parliamentary democracy with all its members 
he said he issued the statement because his earlier statements 
underwent different interpretations in newspapers 
yusuf ozal the premiers brother and a cabinet minister 
criticized the court decision as badly timed it was wrong to 
take such a decision before elections 
turgut ozals governing conservative motherland party is 
competing with several centerright parties for the votes of moslem 
fundamentalists who comprise about 10 percent of the total 
electorate of 27 million 
ozals own party is split on the headgear issue and interference 
by iran complicated matters 
on monday iranian women students marched through tehran to 
protest the ban on islamic dress in turkeys campuses 
turkish papers reported that tehran radio in turkishlanguage 
broadcasts beamed to eastern turkey urged fundamentalists to rebel 
against the secular order 
newspaper reports said authorities detained iranian agents who 
were among the protesters in turkey but officials did not confirm 
these reports 
beginning in the 1920s turkey adopted western laws with the 
reforms of kemal ataturk founder of the republic

educators who yank apples from school lunch 
rooms for fear of chemical contamination are running from a toxic 
bogeyman the state health director said tuesday 
biting into a shiny red apple as he discussed the issue with 
reporters kenneth kizer said fears that children will get cancer 
from the farm chemical daminozide or alar are based on a 
misinterpretation of a recent study by a private interest group 
apples and apple products are being banned from school cafeterias 
in cities around the nation because of publicity about the potential 
cancer threat from alar a chemical used in a minority of orchards 
school systems in atlanta san francisco chicago and dozens of 
other cities stopped distributing apples this week following the 
earlier lead of new york city and los angeles schools in san diego 
and portland ore decided against such a ban 
california is conducting its own tests on apples to assess any 
risk the results arent due for another 10 days but kizer said he 
believes the school apple bans are reactionary and premature and 
indeed our fear is they have really created a toxic bogeyman 
kizer advised consumers to continue eating fruit saying there 
may be worse dangers in sugary alternatives 
when we send a message to our kids that apples arent safe 
what are they going to eat theyre going to eat twinkies and 
zingers he said 
despite his comments millions of schoolchildren went without 
apples applesauce and juice tuesday as more schools quit serving 
apple products because the fruit might be tainted with alar 
farm groups maintain there is little threat from the chemical 
and the manufacturer uniroyal chemical co of middlebury conn 
estimates it is used on only 5 percent of americas apple crop 
its far more dangerous for them school children to ride the 
school bus or breathe the air than eating an apple treated with 
alar said ron myers a wenatchee wash apple grower who is also 
a member of the washington apple commission 
daminozide is used most commonly on apples but also on other 
fruit and on flowers it prevents apples from dropping or being 
blown from trees before they ripen brings out color in some 
varieties and may help improve texture and shelf life 
the latest controversy over alar was prompted by an nrdc report 
that said daminozide poses a greater cancer threat to children than 
to adults the public interest group said research shows that is 
because childrens bodies are smaller and because they tend to eat 
more apples and apple products 
worries about alar grew as 60 minutes broadcast a report on 
the subject and actress meryl streep spoke out in alarm 
the environmental protection agency said in february that tests 
show a correlation between the chemical and cancer in mice the 
agency is conducting an 18month review with an eye toward banning 
the chemical 
atlanta school officials say mondays decision to scratch apples 
from school lunch menus was strictly precautionary taken in the 
absence of any evidence that alartreated apples have been served in 
the systems 116 schools 
when youre talking about children we believe its better to 
take precautions said modenia n andrews director of nutrition 
for atlanta schools theres so much in the media we felt it 
expedient to go ahead and make that decision until more information 
is available 
because of the public outcry i feel its better to be 
conservative and eliminate the apples until its cleared by the 
fda said richard farrar director of food services for the san 
francisco unified school district 
a spokesman for the california farm bureau federation and apple 
growers said the san francisco districts move was unfounded 
they are attacking the whole industry when its just a small 
group of growers in the northwest using alar said grower john 
bella they are hurting us real bad and its unfair they should 
get their facts straight 
uniroyal chemical estimates use has dropped to about 5 percent of 
the us apple crop because of health concerns raised in recent 
years thats down from 40 percent of the crop in 1985 when cancer 
concerns were last raised 
varieties most commonly treated are macintosh red delicious 
golden delicious and jonathan granny smith pippin and other green 
apples generally arent treated 
california is the nations fourthbiggest producer of apples a 
market dominated by washington state

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday that it is premature to talk about withdrawing us troops 
from south korea but he said the bush administration is pressing 
the seoul government to increase its share of the common defense 
burden 
i do think its a bit premature to talk about pulling troops 
out when you consider the security threat that still exists as far 
as the north koreans are concerned baker told a house 
appropriations subcommittee 
if we were ever to get to that point i would think we would 
only get there after the south koreans themselves had significantly 
beefed up their own armed forces he added 
baker testifying before the committee about the us foreign aid 
program was asked by rep robert j mrazek dny why the us 
had no plans to withdraw its 40000 troops from south korea a 
nation that has the most dynamic economy in the world right now 
there are over 40 million south koreans there are around 20 
million north koreans and we continue to spend billions of dollars 
in supporting our troops in that nation said mrazek 
he said the pentagon has a draft plan for the withdrawal of us 
troops from panama and contingency plans to reduce us bases in the 
philippines but nothing for korea 
overwhelmingly the american people recognize that at this 
particular juncture considering the investment of almost 100 
billion since 1954 that the south koreans can pretty well take 
care of themselves mrazek said 
i dont see any reason why south korea cant put more people in 
uniform in defending its own interests he added 
baker answered that its very important to recognize that there 
may be more south koreans than north koreans but there are a heck 
of a lot more north koreans in uniform and in the armed forces and 
they are percentagewise i suppose the most heavily armed nation 
or one of the most heavily armed nations in the world 
our commitment to the security of south korea is what has 
enabled it to become the dynamic economic power that it has 
become he added it has only recently come out of the shadows 
of being a debtor nation 
he said that when he and president bush and he visited south 
korea last month they impressed on president roh taewoo and other 
south koreans the importance of increasing their share of the 
defense burden and accepting the role in the world that success 
brings 
they are no longer a developing country baker said and we 
need access to their markets and we need we need fairness with 
respect to exchange rates and things like that

a federal judge approved the settlement of the 
governments civil racketeering case against the teamsters on 
tuesday saying it meant the unions leadership is pledged to keep 
it free from the influence of organized crime 
us district judge david n edelstein signed the agreement 
reached just before a trial of the governments lawsuit was to begin 
monday noting that the teamsters union has had a long and sordid 
career of corruption and involvement with criminal elements 
but in agreeing to the settlement which will implement sweeping 
reforms including the direct election of the unions top leadership 
teamster officials have today done their members a great 
service edelstein said 
however teamsters president william j mccarthy one of the 
individual defendants in the case was less enthusiastic in his 
comments 
while i reluctantly accept the terms of the consent order i 
believe it is not the vindication and exoneration teamsters 
deserve mccarthy said in a statement issued by the union the 
fact is this suit should never have been filed in the first place 
under the tentative agreement which the government says will 
wrest the nations largest trade union from mafia domination three 
courtappointed watchdogs will oversee the teamsters union for three 
years 
edelstein received the settlement monday afternoon but delayed 
approving it to clarify apparent ambiguities on matters of serious 
importance 
the main change made at edlesteins request was that the 
government and the teamsters agree on two names to submit to the 
judge for each of the watchdog positions so that six names instead 
of three will be offered for the three posts 
the settlement announced just hours before the start of the 
trial on a federal civil racketeering lawsuit to oust the unions 
allegedly mobinfluenced executive board was reached early monday 
after roundtheclock weekend negotiations 
the lawsuit filed last june claimed the teamsters leadership 
had been dominated by organized crime which deprived union members 
of their rights through racketeering and a campaign of fear that 
included 20 murders dozens of bombings and other violence 
most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named as defendants in 
the case were dismissed when they either agreed or were ordered to 
drop any involvement with the teamsters five including convicted 
colombo crime family boss carmine junior persico have been 
severed from the case and are to be tried later 
for the first time in teamsters history the unions top leaders 
will be elected directly by the membership in secret ballot votes 
beginning in 1991 
currently delegates to the national convention pick the 
executive board members by rollcall vote 
under the settelement the three overseers will be appointed for 
three years by the judge with the joint approval of both sides one 
would investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption another 
would administer disciplinary action and the third would oversee 
elections 
after the 1991 union elections are certified the three overseers 
will be replaced by an independent review board empowered to 
investigate and remedy allegations of corruption

rescue teacms succeeded in helping 30 
grounded whales back into the open waters of the strait of magellan 
but eight others died on the beach authorities reported tuesday 
alejandro roman regional director of the national fishing 
agency said the whales had been stranded for more than 24 hours at 
playa pescado 18 miles north of the town of punta arenas the 
whales ranged in length from nine to 15 feet 
reporters for state television covered the rescue operation and 
said most of the whales that died resisted efforts to move them into 
the water 
it was the third mass grounding of whales on beaches along the 
strait of magellan in two weeks navy officials said dozens of the 
mammals were saved by navy personnel and fishermen who managed to 
get them back into deeper waters but at least 90 perished 
marine specialists said they had no explanation for the 
groundings actions but speculated that the normally frigid waters at 
the tip of south america were unusually warm and that affected the 
whales sonar system of determining directions

the skipper of the uss vincennes whose wife was 
the apparent target of a pipe bomb attack emerged from protected 
seclusion tuesday to take the ships helm 
navy capt will c rogers who was commanding the vincennes last 
year when its crew mistakenly shot down an iranian airliner guided 
the ship out of the san diego naval station for routine daylong 
exercises off the california coast a navy spokesman said 
the fbi continued its investigation into the bombing of a van 
driven by his wife sharon rogers and said it had not dismissed the 
possibility that the bomb was planted by international terrorists 
agency spokesman ron orrantia said it would be premature to rule 
out any potential motive in fridays bombing including retribution 
for the airliner downing 
sen pete wilson rcalif said monday that the fbi appeared to 
be backing off the theory that the bombing was internationally 
directed terrorism because the device was a crude pipe bomb 
it is their belief a sophisticated terrorist one who is 
trained in the use of explosives for car bombings would have done a 
better job and that mrs rogers would not have escaped wilson 
said 
bu orrantia said tuesday the fbi is not eliminating anything 
at this point we are leaving all avenues open right now we are not 
trying to limit our scope right now 
mrs rogers escaped the blast unhurt getting out of the van 
moments before it caught fire and burned at a busy san diego 
intersection 
the city fire department described the device as a pipe bomb fbi 
officials have said only that the explosive device was nonmilitary 
in origin possibly homemade and that a pipe bomb would fall into 
that generic category 
fragments recovered from the blast scene have been sent to the 
fbi laboratory in washington for analysis and officials were 
awaiting a final determination about the devices characteristics 
orrantia said 
he declined to discuss other aspects of the investigation but 
said the fbis report on the bomb would be publicly released when it 
is completed 
law enforcement officials are looking into the possibility that 
someone acted on a grudge against the rogers family or that one or 
more rogue iranian supporters acted on their own an fbi official 
told the los angeles times 
naval investigative service agents continue to protect rogers and 
his wife who have been staying at an undisclosed location since 
friday 
the vincennes returned to san diego last october ending a 
sixmonth persian gulf deployment it was during that deployment in 
july that the cruiser mistook a civilian airliner for a hostile 
aircraft during a firefight with iranian surface ships and brought 
it down with a missile all 290 people aboard the plane were killed

about drug trafficking and there has been no evidence of any harm to 
you or any threats to you obrien told jacobs 20

state legislators tuesday condemned a student 
artwork that features a us flag spread on the floor as novelist 
larry heinemann joined a statewide arts organization in support of 
the embattled exhibit 
after more than an hour of impassioned debate in springfield the 
illinois house approved a nonbinding resolution 995 urging that 
the exhibit at the school of the art institute of chicago be closed 
its not a veterans issue its an american issue said state 
rep linda williamson who had joined in protests in chicago against 
the exhibit most of the demonstrators were veterans and their 
families 
the finance committee of the chicago park district owner of the 
land on which the art institute is located also on tuesday reversed 
itself and recommended that the art institute and seven other 
chicago museums get 284 million in funding the full board later 
approved the appropriation 
last week the committee citing the flag exhibit voted to cut 
off the money the art institutes share is 65 million 
republican state sen walter dudycz a leader in protests against 
the flag exhibit held a noon rally at the capitol in springfield to 
draw attention to his resolution condemning the artwork 
heinemann a chicagoan who won the 1987 national book award for 
his novel pacos story said the enormous public response to the 
exhibit at the school of the art institute indicated the school was 
doing its job 
although the display has deeply and greatly shocked many 
people heinemann said any arts institute fails if students 
are not given the freedom to explore subject matter and content 
both dudycz and heinemann are vietnam veterans 
the illinois arts alliance said the art institute had a 
constitutional right to display the work by student scott tyler 
and when we trample on the us constitution we trample on 
everything the american flag symbolizes said henry fogel 
president of the multidisciplinary statewide advocacy organization 
for the arts fogel appeared at a news conference with heinemann 
the work what is the proper way to display a us flag 
consists of a 32by59inch flag spread on a floor next to a wall 
on the wall are mounted a photograph of several flagdraped coffins 
and a small shelf on the shelf which is located directly above the 
flag are a bound collection of other photographs including one of 
a us flag being burned and a ledger in which visitors are 
invited to write comments 
the display is part of a 66student show that opened on feb 17 
and is scheduled to close thursday 
the exhibit has enraged veterans groups who contend it 
encourages people to walk on the us flag and has prompted daily 
demonstrations outside the art institute including one on sunday 
that drew more than 2000 people 
in midland mich the city council on monday night unanimously 
approved a resolution condemning the chicago exhibit midland is 
near saginaw about 250 miles northeast of chicago 
my whole being just rebels at the thought of any dishonor to 
the flag said councilman harry mccaffrey who introduced the 
resolution 
on tuesday a tavern in beach park a town north of chicago said 
it would cover its floor with pictures of artist tyler on wednesday 
and invite patrons to walk on them

the entire 23man crew missing from a 
chemical tanker that burst into flames tuesday probably were trapped 
inside the ship and did not survive japanese coast guard officials 
said 
the search resumed wednesday for the irish captain three britons 
and 19 filipinos who were aboard yukio yoshino earlier told a news 
conference the mens chances for survival now were very slim 
yoshino head of the yokohama branch of the maritime safety 
agency japans coast guard said since there was no time for 
crew members to send an emergency signal it is unlikely that they 
had time to prepare lifeboats for escape 
the tanker is still burning and the explosions are 
continuing yoshio nakamura spokesman for the agencys yokohama 
branch reported on wednesday 
the skipper was james rickard 50 of ireland earlier erroneous 
accounts had rickard as coming from britain 
the liberiaregistered 23038ton maasgusar containing 25700 
tons of flammable toxic liquids was found engulfed in flames about 
66 miles southwest of nojimazaki south of tokyo early tuesday 
morning by a patrol plane 
powerful explosions apparently blew a huge hole in a chemical 
tank on the ships port side television reports showed chemicals 
leaking out of the hole and burning on the surface of the water he 
said 
the maritime safety agency and the maritime selfdefense force 
sent 14 ships and 11 aircraft to rescue crew members and help douse 
the fire but no vessels were able to approach the tanker by tuesday 
evening because of the strong flames the thick toxic fumes rising 
more than 330 feet and the occasional explosions 
patrol planes searching the area found four plastic lifeboats 
some of them halfburned from the tanker but no trace of its 
crewmen yoshino said 
the agency decided not to take any measures to extinguish the 
fire at least until wednesday morning because of the intense flames 
and smoke he said 
agency officials expressed concern about possible pollution that 
the leak of the poisonous fumes and chemicals might cause the 
chemicals that have leaked out can injure the skin and cause toxic 
reactions said hiroshi watanabe of the ministry of international 
trade and industrys chemical product division 
whether or not the chemicals are acute toxins its definitely 
not good if such chemicals stay in the ocean for a long period of 
time he said 
maritime safety agency officials said the tankers 25000 tons of 
chemicals including ethylene chloride isopropyl benzene and 
paraxylene had begun to leak into the ocean and poisonous gas was 
released as the cargo burned the amount of contamination due to the 
discharge could not be immediately determined they said 
the cause of the fire was unknown but the 5yearold tanker 
designed to carry special petroleum chemicals had recently 
developed engine problems and underwent provisional repairs during a 
trip off the coast of hawaii said an official of nedlloyd japan a 
branch of the netherlandsbased operator of the ship 
the turbo charger of the ships engine was found to have defects 
and some parts inside the turbo cylinders were replaced said 
katsumi sato nedlloyds director of operations 
agency officials said an explosion may have caused the fire 
preventing the crew from sending distress signals 
the tanker was on its way from houston to south korea via panama 
and yokohama it had been expected to dock at yokohama port around 
noon tuesday sato said

the bush administration suspended imports of 
ak47s and most other semiautomatic weapons tuesday but denied any 
change in president bushs oftstated opposition to gun control 
more than 110000 assaulttype weapons with pending applications 
for import will be affected according to the announcement by the 
new national drug control director william j bennett 
the action does not affect weapons already in this country but 
blocks import of certain guns unless it can be determined they are 
for sporting use officials said 
it also does not affect weapons made in the united states such 
as the ar15 the semiautomatic civilian version of the 223caliber 
m16 
the administrations decision comes amid a rising chorus of calls 
for controlling semiautomatic weapons which many police officials 
say are the weapon of choice for drug pushers the weapons have been 
increasingly used in drugrelated shootings particularly in urban 
areas 
the push for controls on semiautomatics was also given impetus by 
the jan 17 slaying of five school children in stockton calif by 
patrick edward purdy who then killed himself purdy also injured 29 
other children and and one teacher 
among the weapons purdy used as a chinesemade ak47 
semiautomatic which he had purchased at an oregon gun store 
before tuesday bush had not indicated any willingness to move 
against the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons except to say he 
wanted bennett to study various options 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the move 
reflected no change in bushs opposition to banning such guns but 
merely would enforce current law that allows for import of the guns 
only if they are for sporting purposes 
on feb 16 bush told reporters he would strongly oppose any 
attempt to ban semiautomatic weapons despite public concern over an 
increasing number of homicides mostly related to drug violence 
involving such guns 
on march 7 bush told a news conference that he had asked bennett 
to look into what could be done about ak47s one type of 
semiautomatic rifle but that he wanted to find a way to still do 
whats right by the legitimate sportsman 
he said solving the problem was not as easy as it seems 
tuesdays news release in bennetts name said that treasury 
secretary nicholas brady who has jurisdiction over the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms decided to suspend effective 
immediately the importation of several makes of assaulttype 
weapons pending a decision as to whether these weapons are as 
required by law particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to 
sporting purposes 
bush a longtime member of the national rifle association 
shares the public concern over the proliferation of 
semiautomatic weapons said fitzwater 
applications so far this year to import such weapons already have 
passed the total of the previous three years bennett said 
the new policy was announced late in the afternoon and white 
house officials directed questions about it to bennetts office 
though saying they were not trying to take the spotlight off bush 
bush had asked bennett who on monday officially was sworn in as 
the nations drug czar to take the lead on looking into ways to 
address the problem fitzwater noted 
he said it was coincidence that the move came a day after the 
california state assembly passed a sweeping ban on 40 types of 
semiautomatics 
the national rifle association which has opposed limits on 
semiautomatic weapons reacted with caution to the move saying it 
would put a stop to the media hysteria surrounding the 
semiautomatic version of the ak47 rifle and should provide an 
atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue 
todays action by the secretary of the treasury we trust will 
end the rush to come up with illconceived and illdefined 
legislative proposals which could turn millions of americans into 
felons and deprive honest citizens of firearms they have lawfully 
owned for decades wayne lapierre executive director of the nra 
institute for legislative action said in a statement 
rep larry craig ridaho who is an nra board member said 
the problem is not guns themselves but the criminal element he 
said 
the administration decision came after conferences among brady 
bennett and stephen e higgins the director of the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms 
bureau spokesman dick pedersen said higgins and bennett 
together felt it was time to suspend the importation so we are 
doing that 
the bureau approved the import of 88000 semiautomatic weapons 
during 1986 1987 and 1988 this year so far the government has 
received requests to import many more than that with 113732 
applications pending for import of akstype weapons alone according 
to bennetts figures 
affected by the import suspension are akstype weapons including 
ak47s uzi carbines fnfal and fnfnctype weapons as well as 
steyr aug semiautomatic weapons 
several makes not included are imported only in small numbers and 
are not a problem said alcohol tobacco and firearms 
spokeswoman dot koester 
she could not provide a list of weapons made in this country that 
would fall under the category of assault rifle 
atf has the authority to regulate the importation of weapons 
into the united states to make sure they fall into certain 
categories pedersen said were saying some of these weapons 
may not fall into some of the prescribed categories such as 
hunting 
the administrations move brought praise from sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio who has introduced legislation to ban new 
assault weapons in the united states and to require registration of 
such weapons already in circulation 
this is a major first step but currently nothing prevents the 
manufacture of these weapons here in the united states metzenbaum 
said

a problem with a hydrogen tank 
aboard the space shuttle discovery forced its astronauts to conserve 
energy tuesday and threatened to shorten the mission but mission 
control said there was no threat to the crew 
the five crew members monitored scientific experiments and 
photographed environmental damage on the earth a day after they 
roared into orbit and launched a key nasa communications satellite 
the problem was an erratic pressure reading in one of three 
hydrogen tanks and in its manifold which carries the hydrogen to 
fuel cells the hydrogen is combined with oxygen in the fuel cells 
to produce electricity for shuttle systems with water as a 
byproduct 
there are no safety problems associated with it and no 
electrical problems ground control capsule communicator mike 
baker told the astronauts 
national aeronautics and space administration flight director 
chuck shaw said tuesday night that ground controllers hoped to solve 
the problem by turning the tank back on wednesday morning using only 
one of its two heaters controllers expected to turn the tank on 
around 9 am cst 
i think things will work out just fine with the heater 
tomorrow shaw said adding that the tank will be thoroughly 
checked after being put back in operation 
shaw said a similar erratic reading on the same hydrogen tank was 
noticed on discoverys flight last fall but said there had been no 
fluctuation noted on the manifold reading 
the erratic reading he said was believed to be associated with 
how the hydrogen is heated and then pushed out of the tank to the 
fuel cells 
earlier tuesday flight director granvil pennington said that if 
the problem couldnt be resolved and discovery had to continue to 
use only two hydrogen tanks the shuttle may land friday instead of 
saturday 
right now were still planning to land on saturday 
pennington said he said nasa could wait as late as thursday before 
deciding to end the mission a day early 
without that third tank the shuttle might not have electricity 
to support a fiveday flight plus two days for any contingencies 
discovery currently is scheduled to land saturday at edwards air 
force base calif at 634 am pst 
the other two hydrogen tanks continued feeding the shuttles fuel 
cells and the crew took steps to save electricity unnecessary 
lights were turned off as well as some redundant computers and two 
data display screens 
after the powering down tuesday morning the crew continued 
with planned tasks such as monitoring experiments and photographing 
environmentally damaged such as the rain forests of brazil and the 
mexican coastline 
pennington said the crews power conservation efforts would not 
hurt the experiments 
on monday several hours after discoverys liftoff the crew 
completed their primary task deployment of a 100 million tracking 
data and relay satellite to complete a communications network that 
will allow shuttle astronauts to have nearly constant contact with 
mission control 
the satellite joins one fully functioning and one backup tdrs in 
orbit 22300 miles above the earth to relay radio communications 
between shuttles and the earth during 85 percent of each orbit 
using ground relay stations radio contact is possible only when 
the shuttle is roughly above each station a total of about 15 
percent of each orbit 
the space agency will soon close six ground stations at a monthly 
savings of 3 million 
also on board discovery are four rats who each had a leg bone 
cut before the launch the student experiment is designed to study 
how bones heal in space 
another student experiment aboard the shuttle consists of 
fertilized chicken eggs stored in an incubator the experiment is 
aimed at determining whether an embryo can develop normally in zero 
gravity 
during the afternoon nasa television showed spectacular footage 
of the hawaiian islands taken by a camera in the payload bay later 
shots of a moon glowing in the black sky and lightning around the 
earth could be seen 
nasa television also showed astronauts robert c springer and dr 
james m bagian in the shuttle middeck checking on an experiment on 
how roots grow in space 
overheating problems cropped up with the root experiment and a 
cooling system being tested in the shuttle cargo bay the cooling 
system which uses vaporized ammonia to carry heat from shuttle 
systems out to space was shut down early so ground engineers could 
study the problem 
in addition an electronic facsimile machine being tested on the 
shuttle had problems receiving messages from the ground to the crew 
when controllers sent 35 pages some of the papers coming out of the 
machine were folded mission control commentator billie deason said 
early tuesday ground controllers awakened the crew by playing 
james browns rowdy song i got you i feel good brown the 
godfather of soul is serving a sixyear prison term in south 
carolina for charges stemming from a twostate auto chase 
were trying to figure out how you got james brown out on 
parole to sing that to us said discovery commander mike coats 
that was just a special appearance replied capsule 
communicator david low in mission control we thought that was 
very appropriate music youve got the whole ground team here 
feeling real good 
discoverys other crew members are pilot john e blaha and 
mission specialist james f buchli 
it is the 28th shuttle mission and the third since challenger was 
destroyed and its seven astronauts were killed more than three years 
ago

the february crash of an 
americanchartered jetliner in the azores that claimed 144 lives 
probably was caused by overlapping radio messages the government 
reported tuesday 
it said the boeing 707 apparently was flying at an altitude of 
about 2000 feet instead of 3000 feet when it crashed into the 
fogcovered pico alto mountain killing all aboard 
the ministry of public works transport and communications gave 
this account of the overlapping messages 
the control tower authorized the pilot to descend to 3000 feet 
advised him which runway to use and asked him to renew contact when 
the plane was at 3000 feet 
but at the same time the tower was sending the message the pilot 
was radioing plans to descend to 2000 feet 
neither the pilot nor tower heard the others message and the jet 
continued on its fatal course 
the plane hit in a zone where flying is not permitted below 
an altitude of 3000 feet the report said 
the plane owned by independent air corp of smyrna tenn was 
carrying italian tourists on their way to the caribbean with a stop 
at the azores island of santa maria when the accident occurred feb 
8 
the report said the investigating commission found no indication 
of mechanical or technical failure of the plane and ruled out 
sabotage or other criminal action 
traffic controllers at the tower did give the jets crew an 
atmospheric pressure reading of 1027 millibars instead of the 
correct 11087 millibars according to the report it said the 
difference in pressure readings would mean the jets altimeters told 
the pilot he was 240 feet above his actual position

eastern airlines won court approval tuesday for a plan to help 
ticket holders grounded by the 12dayold machinists strike and 
union leaders offered to return to work under congressional orders 
even with drastic pay cuts 
meanwhile the national air line pilots association threw a crimp 
into any eastern effort to sell aircraft or routes by refusing to 
fly them for different carriers unless strikesupporting eastern 
pilots are hired for the work 
in atlanta the 11th us circuit court of appeals refused to 
order eastern pilots to return to work but set a hearing on march 
23 before a threejudge panel to hear full arguments on the 
airlines appeal in tallahassee fla 
and in a labor rally at dusk in miami mary jane barry president 
of the transport workers union local representing flight attendants 
told a crowd of 750 that an anticontinental campaign would be 
launched thursday in denver one of the carriers hubs she would 
not elaborate 
eastern launched 94 flights monday and expected the same number 
tuesday and wednesday the airline had been projecting up to 140 
flights per day by now but spokesman jim ashlock said were just 
doing what were doing 
we dont even think it was that many said pilots association 
spokesman jb stokes i think theyre being generous to 
themselves 
the airline had run more than 1000 flights daily before the 
strike by its machinists in a contract dispute over wage concessions 
the eastern ticket plan submitted and approved tuesday under the 
airlines chapter 11 financial reorganization filing in us 
bankruptcy court in new york offered a firstclass upgrade for 
anyone with eastern tickets and reservations on routes still being 
flown 
consumers also could hold their tickets until eastern resumes 
flights and get a halfprice fare for a companion or obtain coupons 
from other airlines hotels rental car companies good for the 
purchase of their services at discounted prices 
sistercarrier continental airlines will continue to honor 
eastern tickets and eastern continues to work with other airlines 
to help establish policies for acceptance of eastern tickets the 
company said in a news release 
eastern also is seeking permission to pay commissions to travel 
agents for the fourth quarter of 1988 money that was tied up along 
with salaries when the nations seventhlargest carrier filed for 
bankruptcy protection thursday 
rep james oberstar dminn expected a vote on the house floor 
wednesday on his legislation that would require president bush to 
intervene by appointing an emergency panel as recommended by the 
national mediation board after 17 months of fruitless talks between 
eastern and the machinists 
the measure by oberstar chairman of the aviation subcommittee of 
the house public works and transportation committee would order 
eastern employees back to work at prestrike salaries and require 
the panel to recommend a settlement in 21 days with the president 
having the discretion to add five days 
but the legislation even if passed isnt given much chance of 
surviving a presidential veto and its standing in bankruptcy court 
is uncertain 
if the government asks us to go back under the imposed rules 
well do that machinists leader wally haber said referring to 
wage cuts imposed by eastern after the strike began we have to 
start generating new revenue and well only generate revenue when 
we get back to work 
machinists charged that the new wage scales imposed by eastern 
when the strike began are now the lowest in the airline industry 
eastern did not address the statement directly but spokesman 
ashlock said our work rules are also predicated on what we look 
on as industry standards the union wants to look at comparisons 
between airlines we have to look at the overall marketplace and 
say for this particular job what are qualified people willing to 
take this job for 
the pilots union is trying to protect its 3600 eastern members 
by requiring other carriers who buy eastern assets to hire eastern 
pilots and preserve their seniority the alpa also announced a 9 
million package of strike benefits ranging from 2400 a month in 
strike benefits to interestfree loans to cover withheld paychecks 
in bankruptcy court the alpa asked to transfer eastern management 
from its parent texas air corp to a trustee accusing texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo of stripping easterns assets and the 
8500member machinists union asked for 8 million in paychecks due 
last friday and 1 million in insurance premiums due for february 
coverage 
also tuesday 
the communications workers of america board approved a 100000 
contribution to support eastern strikers the union also urged its 
700000 members to donate 2 a month through local unions for the 
strikers 
the american association of travel agents urged transportation 
secretary samuel skinner to set up a plan for refunds to eastern 
ticket holders and said he should order other airlines to accept the 
tickets 
us supreme court justice william j brennan refused to let the 
eastern strike spread to a philadelphiaarea commuter railroad that 
carries 90000 passengers a day 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis threw his support to strikers 
at a rally in boston tuesday night by 1000 eastern machinists and 
sympathizers youve got a governor whos a union member and proud 
of it said dukakis

the national assembly on tuesday 
approved amnesty for 1933 former members of the national guard 
most of whom had been jailed since the sandinista revolution 
overthrew the somoza dynasty in july 1979 
among those given amnesty were 39 former guardsmen including 
three lieutenant colonels whose names did not appear on a list of 
1894 prisoners that president daniel ortega recommended be granted 
amnesty 
ortega announced at a celebration of the sandinista revolution 
last month that he would recommend that the assembly grant the 
amensties 
the prisoners are to be released in a ceremony on sunday at the 
prison in tipitapa 14 miles east of the capital joao baena soares 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states is 
expected to attend cardinal miguel obando y bravo may also be there 
the sandinistadominated legislature approved the mass amnesty 
684 with two members abstaining 
the vote came after an intense fivehour debate during which the 
opposition argued for the amnesty of those on the original list 
submitted by ortega along with 39 others 
several sandinista deputies argued against the release saying 
the prisoners committed unpardonable crimes when they served under 
president anastasio somoza 
somoza fled managua on july 17 1979 two days before the 
sandinstas marched triumphantly into the capital he was later 
assassinated in exile 
the national assemblys committee on human rights and peace had 
examined the list and earlier determined that 39 prisoners had 
committed atrocious crimes against the nicaraguan people and 
had not demonstrated will to change their ways 
but during tuesdays debate opposition representatives noted 
that the organization of american states interamerican commission 
on human rights had recommended that the leftist sandinista 
government free all jailed former guardsmen 
the assembly approved the additional 39 cases even though their 
amensty is sure to be challenged by authorities legislators said 
the amnesty is the result of accords reached by central american 
presidents in el salvador on feb 14 
after the meeting ortega promised to institute democratic 
reforms and move up the presidential elections to february 1990 10 
months earlier than scheduled 
the presidents also agreed to draft a plan within 90 days to 
dismantle the ussupported nicaraguan rebel force now living in 
honduras 
the assembly approved the amnesty with the understanding that 
the freeing of the prisoners will contribute to creating conditions 
for the demobilization relocation and repatriation of those 
nicaraguans who have been involved in either indirect or direct 
armed activities in honduran territory 
relatives of jailed guardsmen pleaded for their release in 
tuesdays debate 
rosa maria herrera wife of jailed former guardsman juan de dios 
herrera sobbed quietly when the assembly approved her husbands 
release 
her sister two brothersinlaws and a cousin also will be freed 
under the amnesty they were innocent she said 
sandinsta deputy danilo aguirre solis opposed the amnesty and 
said despite it the nicaraguan people will never forget their 
crimes 
he said those being let go were responsible for the deaths of 
about 50000 nicaraguans during the revolution

several television ministries whose finances 
are being audited by the internal revenue service in the wake of the 
ptl scandal are in danger of losing their federal tax exemptions 
the irs says 
loss of the exemptions would mean future contributors could not 
claim tax deductions for donations to those ministries 
the irs investigated 23 tv ministries during the last quarter of 
1988 the agency said in a report to rep jj pickle dtexas 
chairman of the house ways and means oversight subcommittee pickle

congress auditing agency today attacked the 
governments 1988 spree of savings and loan sales as too costly and 
said it would have been cheaper in a third of the deals reviewed to 
shut down the institutions and pay off depositors 
charles a bowsher comptroller general of the general accounting 
office said in testimony prepared for the senate banking committee 
that sampl regulators required the purchasers to invest too little of 
their own money 
officials at the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
guarantees sampl deposits up to 100000 also underestimated by 20 
percent to 40 percent the value of tax breaks offered to buyers 
bowsher said 
the report comes as white house and treasury department officials 
are reviewing a complex financing plan aimed at protecting regional 
economies from the precipitous sale of billions of dollars of real

the operative word in abcs the women of 
brewster place is women 
the twopart movie airing sunday and tuesday is based on the 
1982 novel by gloria naylor and follows the stories of seven women 
who wind up living on the blighted deadend chicago street in the

individuals have easy access to credit and 
business has big profits to use so the 76monthold economic 
expansion an oldtimer by most standards is springing forward 
like an upstart 
the economys strength which might even be growing continues in 
spite of efforts by the federal reserve to restrain economic 
activity through higher interest rates and in defiance of repeated 
forecasts of an imminent slowdown 
the level of activity has spread doubt among forecasters 
forecasts of a slower economy are just that forecasts says j 
patrick bradley of pnc financial corp we must admit few signs of 
a slower economy can be found 
among the latest reports of economic strength is an updated 
survey by the national federation of independent business that shows 
small business optimism in february was the highest for that month 
in four years 
the survey based on an opinion sampling of the federations 
500000plus business members shows companies are able to withstand 
higher interest rates by financing internally through profits rather 
than by borrowing from banks 
remarkable profit gains continue to keep regular borrowing 
activity at nearrecord low levels said survey founder william 
dunkelberg economist and dean of temple universitys school of 
business 
dunkelberg points out that smaller businesses are aware of rising 
interest rates and clearly expect financing to become more difficult 
and expensive but for the time being have been shielded from 
creditrestraint efforts 
a vaguely similar thesis has been offered to explain the 
continued use of increasingly costly credit by consumers credit is 
so available according to the thesis that the temptation to borrow 
is much stronger than a decade ago 
perhaps the most significant of consumer credit changes is 
development of the home equity loan which often carries with it a 
tax deduction for interest paid moreover housing inflation has 
made relatively large sums available 
whatever the reason the university of michigans consumer 
sentiment index made up of attitudes toward existing and 
anticipated economic conditions rose strongly from december to 
january 
in the business sector dunkelberg termed the optimism 
surprisingly strong 
twentytwo percent of respondents to the smallbusiness survey 
agreed in february that now is a good time to expand up from 16 
percent a year earlier only 12 percent thought the economy would 
weaken while 24 percent indicated they expected it to improve 
these figures represent a substantial turnaround in the outlook 
for the economy he said adding significantly 
in spite of the unprecedented length of the recovery the 
outlook is for further improvements in the economy rather than a 
leveling of economic activity or a recession 
that optimism was reflected in plans to build inventories which 
the 15yearold survey showed were at record highs for the month 
and in hiring plans and job openings which reached a fouryear high 
dunkelberg said that although plans to raise prices continued to 
fall from the expansion high reached in december 1988 when 32 
percent of all respondents had such plans the percentage reporting 
actual price increases continued to rise 
planned or unplanned he said this translates into higher 
inflation rates

the japanese balk at importing american beef and 
rice but they might be ready to import us college educations 
supporters of the idea have almost utopian visions of a future in 
which american colleges here add to international understanding 
reduce trade frictions break the stuffy mold of japanese higher 
education and produce more japanese world citizens 
southern illinois university opened a branch campus last spring 
and says it is faring well with about 450 japanese in intensive 
english courses 
things look quite bright and were pretty much on schedule 
said jared dorn director of the project that in may moves from 
temporary housing in a youth center to a custombuilt campus 
more than 150 american colleges and universities have expressed 
interest in branch campuses in japan in the past two years but 
perhaps only a dozen will succeed 
a strong japanese proponent of importing education is chikara 
higashi the president of temple universitys 2000student branch 
in tokyo and a member of parliament from the governing liberal 
democratic party philadelphiabased temple has had a branch here 
since 1982 and offers a full fouryear degree course 
in recent years japan has opened up industry banks stockbrokers 
and pharmaceuticals to more foreign competition higashi said in an 
interview 
education should be the first to be internationalized but it 
is the last 
japanese education is effective in its early years he said 
but when japan is a leading country and is asked to play a 
larger world role we need japanese who can communicate and take 
leadership in international communities we lack that 
almost every week american and japanese educators visit the 
southern illinois university branch in nakajo a town of 30000 
people 150 miles north of tokyo or the mother campus in carbondale 
ill dorn said by telephone from nakajo 
they are all going very slowly waiting to see what happens 
with us and others 
they are inching toward agreements he added 
the branchcampus wavelet despite doubts in the ministry of 
education has political backing in tokyo and washington 
the top us sponsor is richard gephardt the missouri 
congressman who sought the democratic presidential nomination last 
year on a platform critical of japanese trade surpluses 
but gephardt says his objective is to find ways to help americans 
export more to japan and make the two countries better understand 
each other gephardt is cochairman of the usajapan committee for 
promoting trade expansion a group of us congressmen and members 
of japans parliament the diet the committee coordinates the 
mating of us colleges and host towns 
yusuke kataoka executive director of the tokyo office of 
gephardts committee said japanese university graduates are 
illsuited to an outwardlooking era in which japan has major world 
responsibilities 
american branch campuses kataoka said will be a kind of 
perestroika the soviet term for restructuring to break through the 
inbreeding of the japanese highereducation system 
us higher education is more practical broader more 
cosmopolitan he said 
japan is renowned for turning out diligent students who top world 
rankings in math and science tests but that applies mostly to grade 
school and high school university years are often spent gaining 
friends and a diploma useful in ones career and concentrating on a 
narrow field without studying hard 
by contrast a us college education is regarded here as hard 
work and broad training that develops a more rounded and creative 
adult than japans system which produces gifted team workers but 
not so many precedentsetters 
for example only two japanese scientists have won nobel prizes 
in physics and chemistry since 1970 while 39 americans have been 
honored for basic research an area where japan lags the united 
states 
japanese education is also notorious for the inability of 
graduates to speak english and this is where the american campuses 
see their toehold 
the typical plan is a year of intensive english followed by two 
years of general college education all taught in english by 
professors from us institutions then successful students can 
transfer their credits to the mother college or a related 
institution in the united states and earn a us bachelors degree 
in two more years 
after the campuses establish themselves they also would offer 
courses on japan and related topics to american students 
but that is in the future 
so far said kataoka of the gephardt committee four us 
universities are lined up to follow southern illinois into japan 
texas aampm oklahoma state university the minnesota state 
universities system and mississippi state university 
ministry of education officials tend to doubt us colleges will 
succeed yoshiyuki nishizawa head of an office to promote 
educational and cultural exchanges in the ministry said it may be 
hard to attract students because graduates will not receive the 
japanese university degree that is often essential for getting a 
good job 
and if a student fails to learn english and doesnt get to go 
to the united states he will have nothing for two years work 
nishizawa said adding that it will be hard for the branches to 
maintain strong faculties 
but he conceded that some parents are more interested in having 
their children study abroad than before 
graduates of templejapan have no trouble landing good jobs 
president higashi said and their success may have paved the way for 
the growth of us college branches 
so we will be happy to see more universities come but it will 
be difficult

in denmark the worlds top breeder of 
minks for fashion pelts are selling at below breakeven prices this 
season more than just prices are depressed 
overproduction warm weather and a long campaign by animal rights 
activisits have pushed many of denmarks 5000 mink farms to the 
brink of bankruptcy 
the stock market crash started it said scott novak who 
represents a new york dealer in exclusive garments who was here for 
an international auction that seemed to end that beautiful run we 
had for a few years 
its too early to look for bargains in buying a mink coat off the 
rack however sewing the furs into garments is skilled work and 
labor costs along with retailers markups are high but prices might 
drop later on 
danish breeders produce 35 percent of all mink furs sold in the 
west last year 124 million mink pelts were sold up from 91 
million in 1986 at the same time falling prices reduced income 
from 394 million to 282 million 
its hard to determine the damage done by the animal activists 
who at times have sprayed paint on the fur coats of women in the 
street 
certainly they hurt us said lester taffer a 59year veteran 
of the trade they murdered us in germany and other places 
the protests began in the 1960s to save animals in the wild from 
trappers but the scope later widened to breeding animals for their 
fur 
skimming 06 percent of the turnover at auctions the 
londonbased international fur trade federation finances a 
countercampaign to promote the fur industry in brochures and films 
a global fraternity of fur buyers assembled in february near 
copenhagen to bid for raw materials that will become the luxurient 
apparel in shops in the fall the danish auction house offers the 
largest collection of mink pelts in the world 
minks were fetching between 15 and 34 per pelt two seasons 
ago amid surging garment sales the same types of pelts brought up 
to 45 percent more 
mink production has set records 
this year well be grading more than 15 million pelts four 
times that of the next largest fur center peter krag president 
of danish fur sales said in an interview 
pelts are graded according to sex size color clarity and 
quality creating hundreds of categories 
the fur business has grown in the last 15 years from small 
handicraft shops to a massproduction industry the far east 
supplies an estimated 40 percent of finished product 
danish fur farming began in the 1920s with wild mink imported 
from north america and fed on the abundance of fish caught in danish 
waters 
after world war ii mink production rose steadily and denmark 
rose to become the world leader production has tripled since 1980 
now the glut of mink pelts is threatening many breeders 
two warm winters in a row have added to furriers woes everyone 
in the trade is praying for an extended latewinter cold snap to 
stimulate demand for fur clothing 
recovery from the slump in fur sales demands at least two 
radically improved seasons even a 10 percent reduction would not 
raise prices unless demand soars 
the important thing is that sales companies are meeting the 
market said william frick who represents a major hong kong 
company 
hong kong and other large consumers of raw pelts have thus far 
been purchasing conservatively protecting themselves against a 
further drop in prices eventually when the market gains confidence 
and orders are placed well see a turnover of garments weve never 
seen before low prices today will benefit tomorrows consumer he 
said

if one had to sum up the quickchange artistry of 
jerome robbins broadway in one word that word might be 
velcro 
the way velcro opens and closes at a touch helps make it possible 
for two dressers to whiz actor jason alexander through a 10second 
costume change thats all the time it takes for him to turn from an 
ancient roman in a funny thing happened on the way to the forum 
into a 1912 dandy for high button shoes 
one of the secrets of how alexander who has the lead role of the 
setter can change so fast is that his highbutton shoes dont 
button to save time theyre rigged with zippers 
i think the audience loves quick changes its like magic to 
them said barbara matera owner of barbara matera ltd the shop 
that made the costumes 
velcro a fabric with a surface of clinging pile is a very big 
word in our vocabulary said the shows supervising costume 
designer joseph aulisi 
with nearly 400 costumes in the show and with a cast of 51 
performers and 11 understudies doing production numbers from 11 
musicals there are lots of magical quick changes every night in 
fact there are so many of them that sometimes the entire cast is 
backstage whipping clothes off and on he said twenty dressers help 
because the criticallyacclaimed show is a pastiche of old 
broadway musicals that robbins has either directed or choreographed 
or both theres enough variety to send a costume maker reaching for 
a headache powder 
the musicals are as disparate as the king and i set in siam 
in the 1860s and west side story set in manhattan in the 50s 
matera recently talked about some of the quickchange tricks 
besides velcro and zippers she and aulisi employ to help the singers 
and dancers assume identities from 11 different times and places 
one trick is to dress the cast members in layers that peel off to 
reveal the costume for the next number but for dancers its not 
too comfortable to perform under bright lights as well as layers of 
fabric 
another behindtheseams secret is to line clothes with a 
slippery fabric so they slide easily on and off 
and some belts arent what they appear to be on stage theyre 
not threaded through belt loops but sewn right onto the pants if 
a costume consists of various parts you have to sort of bash them 
all together matera said 
barbara matera ltd has about 30 employees most of the time but 
has given work to as many as 100 people at one time when theres a 
lot to do 
while the company was costuming jerome robbins broadway it 
also did a fulllength version of swan lake for the american 
ballet theater and the road company versions of anything goes 
and into the woods 
costume work is seasonal and yearround jobs are few the new 
york theatrical sourcebook lists 55 costume craftsmen and 20 
costume shops in manhattan and brooklyn however only four or five 
of the shops are highly regarded mainstays said carrie robbins 
master teacher of costuming at new york university and a freelance 
costume designer 
most costume shop employees are drapers or a designers 
assistant tailor or finisher and do not make much money if they 
land a fulltime job they make about 1800026000 
they do it because they love theater and love making 
costumes said robbins 
its not a soft job either 
you go to sleep with bloody hands its very tiring on your 
hands and your arms and your shoulders said maggie raywood the 
workroom supervisor at parsonsmeares ltd another of the top 
costume shops 
parsonsmeares employees should know theyre the ones who made 
the costumes for the broadway musical starlight express in 
which the traincar costumes starred as much as the cast did 
parsonsmeares found unusual fabrics and invented new constructions 
for the costumes which looked like metal but moved like leotards 
the getup for one starlight character even incorporated a 
strobe light which the actor could flash by bringing together his 
forefinger and thumb the back of the glove was made of rubber to 
protect him from shock 
the designs were worked up from scratch 
however in the case of jerome robbins broadway the designs 
already existed aulisi said he recreated the originals as 
faithfully as possible matera said in some cases they were aided by 
the discovery of the designers old renderings with swatches of 
fabric still stapled on 
however aulisi said jerry was quite concerned that the show 
be relevant to the 80s so some stretch fabrics were used to give 
an 80s fit and style that emphasized the dancers bodies 
one thing that didnt change from the original show was the 
beaded silk organza butterfly that decorates the crotch of a 
stripper tessie in a number from gypsy 
matera went to some lengths to recreate it even calling upon the 
actress who originated the role on broadway maria karnilova for 
advice matera wanted to make sure it flapped the way it did in the 
1959 production like karnilova the actress now appearing as 
tessie faith prince makes the butterfly move with a grind of the 
hips 
its weighted in a certain way matera said it doesnt 
exactly flutter it sort of bumps

ten years after the three mile island reactor 
accident in pennsylvania nuclear power in america is approaching a 
critical crossroad 
critics say the nuclear era should be ended in the 1990s to avoid 
unnecessary financial and safety risks supporters say the industry 
must be rejuvenated to preserve an alternative to growing dependence 
on fossil fuels such as oil 
increasingly people on both sides are suggesting that unless a 
comeback is started soon the industry will degenerate to the point 
of no return suppliers of nuclear plant components already are 
dropping out of the business and the pool of universitytrained 
nuclear engineers is shrinking 
it does atrophy and it is more serious than it might seem 
said larry hobart executive director of the american public power 
association a washingtonbased trade group representing publicly 
owned utilities many of which rely on nuclear power 
whatever the longrange outcome few believe atomic power will 
contribute much if anything to the added generating capacity that 
experts say will be needed over the next decade to meet the nations 
growing appetite for electricity 
no new nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978 all those 
ordered after 1974 have been canceled and experts say more 
cancellations are almost certain 
the question now is will another nuclear plant ever be built in 
this country 
the major barriers are still there said alan t crane who 
directed an office of technology assessment report on nuclear power 
that said major changes in technology utility management and public 
acceptance of nuclear power were needed before the industry could 
expect to expand in the 21st century 
a ripple of encouragement is spreading through the industry as 
more public attention is focused on environmental problems 
associated with the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal 
gases from these fuels create a greenhouse effect that some 
scientists say is causing a dangerous warming of the earth 
industry officials say nuclear energy is more environmentally 
sound than fossil fuels and can reduce the us reliance on foreign 
oil 
nuclear foes respond however that relatively few power plants 
run on oil they say it would be wiser to address to improve energy 
efficiency increase conservation pursue ways to burn coal more 
cleanly and use more renewable energy sources such as solar and 
hydropower 
president bush says a national energy policy must include a 
reliance on nuclear power and his support is reflected in the 
choice of james d watkins as energy secretary watkins had 
extensive experience in the navys nuclear reactor program 
we need nuclear power bush said at watkins swearingin 
march 9 
in seeking to win public favor for renewed nuclear activity the 
industry asserts that since the partial meltdown of a reactor at 
three mile island on march 28 1979 nuclear plants have become 
safer and more efficient they note that last year for the first 
time nuclear plants supplied 20 percent of the nations 
electricity and say that the average dose of radiation per plant 
worker has decreased 
there have been many accidental releases of minor amounts of 
radioactivity into the air from nuclear plants since three mile 
island but it is not just the reactors that have hurt the 
industrys image one of the most troubling incidents was at the 
peach bottom plant near delta pa which was shut down by the 
government in march 1987 because control room workers were caught 
sleeping on the job 
industry officials insist the country is better off with a 
network of reactors that can help meet electricity needs throughout 
the 1990s but even the biggest boosters acknowledge the future 
outlook is clouded 
i dont anticipate that we will order any new nuclear plants in 
this century and in my judgment nobody else will either said 
william w berry chairman of virginia power an electric utility 
that runs four nuclear plants 
virginia power canceled four planned nuclear reactors starting 
in 1977 initially because of doubts about the need for the 
additional power capacity but recently with electricity demand 
rising rapidly in its service area the utility faced a choice 
build some new plants or buy power from other suppliers in a move 
that may point to a new trend it decided to take the latter path 
berry and other industry executives as well as government 
regulators environmentalists and independent analysts said in 
interviews that the reasons for the nuclear downfall are simple too 
costly too risky too little public acceptance 
industry leaders say federal regulators also are to blame 
although others disagree 
the three mile island emergency which was caused in part by 
human error galvanized public concern about the safety of nuclear 
power the seeds of trouble however were sown earlier in the 
decade with a decline in the growth of energy demand 
plant cancellations spread as utilities realized their plans were 
too ambitious for an era in which consumers were learning to get by 
with less energy since the first cancellation in 1972 the scratch 
list has grown to 108 exactly equal to the number of plants now 
licensed to operate at full power 
when the tide of energy demand began turning in the mid1980s and 
utilities foresaw a need to expand their generating capacity it 
became apparent that public fears about nuclear safety not just 
economics were a major obstacle 
the american people still dont have any trust in the safety of 
nuclear power sen dale bumpers dark said at a recent 
conference of state energy officials 
though the trust began eroding after the three mile island 
incident many experts believe that even more devastating was the 
reactor explosion and fire at chernobyl in the soviet ukraine in 
which 31 people were killed by radiation exposure 
lester r brown president of the washingtonbased worldwatch 
institute wrote in a report last month that chernobyl did what 
hundreds of studies assessing nuclear technology could never have 
done it made the dangers of nuclear power real 
us industry officials say a catastrophe on the scale of 
chernobyl could not happen in this country because american reactors 
are designed much differently critics say the soviet accident 
points up the unpredictability of nuclear power 
an associated pressmedia general poll conducted in january found 
support for continued use of nuclear plants now operating but only 
a third of those queried supported building more onehalf said a 
serious nuclear accident was likely in the future and 79 percent 
said nuclear safety rules should be more tightly enforced

some opponents of nuclear power have declared the industry dead 
they say that once the current generation of lightwater reactors is 
retired the nuclear era in the united states will draw to a close a 
few alrecommissioned 
michael mariotte director of the nuclear information and 
resource service a sharp critic of the industry said nuclear power 
could be revady are being deived after the turn of the century if the government 
helped industry develop a new generation of reactors with extra 
safety features such as the high temperature gascooled reactor 
another big problem for the industry is waste storage sen j 
bennett johnston dla recently said the governments effort to 
find a burial site for the 1700 tons of highly radioactive waste 
that accumulates each year at power stations was in shambles 
yucca mountain nev was put 
the number of demonstrators in the estonian capital at 30000 
police said 50000 people turned out and organizers claimed from 
80000 to 100000 participants finnish radio reported from tallinn 
the protest was organized by interfront a group dominated by 
ethnic russians it called tuesday in the estonian partys daily 
newspaper sovietskaya estonia for people to demonstrate against 
creeping counterrevolution undermining socialism in estonia and in 
the baltic region of the ussr 
the group claims the 420000 ethnic russians in estonia are 
victims of discrimination estonias parliament using the greater 
autonomy granted local lawmakers under president mikhail s 
gorbachev voted jan 18 to require nonestonians who work in jobs 
where they come into contact with the public to learn estonian in 
four years or face dismissal 
interfront wants russian to be granted the status of an official 
state language in estonia on a par with estonian 
ethnic estonians make up 65 percent of the republics 15 million 
inhabitants with ethnic russians totaling 28 percent 
finnish radio said interfront guaranteed a large turnout in 
tuesdays demonstration by starting the march directly from 
factories during working hours workers had no choice but to follow 
their leaders the radio said 
ms saarna said russianlanguage schools in tallinn were given 
the day off and nonestonian residents of the baltic republics 
northeast were brought in to the capital to swell the number of 
marchers 
speaking by telephone from tallinn ms saarna said the 
demonstrators wound peacefully through the city of 478000 people 
waving flags and carrying banners that read down with 
discrimination and give russian the status of a state language 
at a rally held later outside tallinns city hall speakers 
accused leaders of the estonian communist party and government of 
being bourgeois nationalists and of carrying out a 
counterrevolution ms saarna said 
she said they did not specifically attack estonias party leader 
vaino vyalyas a reformer and gorbachev protege who was appointed to 
the post last summer 
banners carried in the march called for friendship among all 
peoples of the ussr but when one speaker began his address in 
estonian rather than russian listeners whistled and stamped their 
feet in protest ms saarna said 
orators demanded an emergency meeting in april of the estonian 
partys policymaking central committee possibly with gorbachev in 
attendance to halt bourgeois nationalism and 
counterrevolution ms saarna said 
speakers also objected to the decision of estonias party and 
government to fly the baltic states old flag which had long been 
illegal under soviet rule from the highest medieval castle tower in 
tallinn ms saarna said 
the blue black and white standard was hoisted at gherman tower 
on feb 24 71 years after estonia declared its independence 
estonia like its neighbors latvia and lithuania was forcibly 
absorbed by the kremlin in 1940 the flag remains a powerful symbol 
of its shortlived independence 
speakers at the rally called for the tricolor flag to be hauled

placed alongside it ms saarna said 
if they dont hear within two weeks that their demands have been 
met interfront members said they would stage a twohour strike on 
april 3 and a daylong work stoppage a week later ms saarna said 
however she said reports circulating in tallinn said vyalyas had 
met with gorbachev on monday and that gorbachev expressed support 
for the estonian partys present course 
since gorbachev came to power in march 1985 party and government 
leaders in the baltic have been given more leeway in meeting popular 
demands for increased local control over affairs 
in november the estonian parliament declared its sovereignty 
over all internal matters the presidium of the moscowbased supreme 
soviet the nations top executive body declared the action 
illegal but estonian lawmakers have refused to abide by that 
decree saying their republics constitution takes precedence

harold denton is like a rock group that 
produces a hit then is obliged to perform it again and again 
denton 52 was the nuclear regulatory commissions most senior 
official sent to the three mile island power station for the 
nations worst commercial nuclear accident 
his calm easy manner and frank discussion of what was happening 
helped reassure the public while technicians got the crisis under 
control 
ten years later he remains an ardent booster of nuclear power 
his career has taken him to nuclearpowered generating plants around 
the world including two visits to chernobyl where an april 1986 
accident killed at least 31 people and released a radioactive cloud 
but people still associate denton with three mile island 
im always introduced never can get rid of it as tmi 
spokesman he recalled during an interview at the agencys 
headquarters in this washington suburb 
being a symbol during the uncertainty of the emergency carried 
responsibilties the biggest was that no matter how bad things got 
denton knew he could not leave 
we had people on our own staff who got too concerned to be 
useful and had to return home they just didnt want to be there 
he said 
the tension was so high its hard to recreate people would 
joke that if they saw a truck being hitched up to my trailer and my 
leaving that would be a distinct clue that it was time to leave 
he said 
recognizing his status as an industry spokesman he returned to 
the plant 16 months after the accident to demonstrate his faith in 
the safety of venting radioactive krypton gas into the atmosphere 
the gas had escaped into the reactor containment building during the 
accident 
at the time denton was the nrcs chief safety officer for 
reactors a post he held until becoming director of the agencys 
governmental and public affairs unit in 1987 
it is his new job overseeing the nrcs international programs 
that took him to chernobyl 
denton considers three mile island way way down on the 
seriousness scale when compared to chernobyl very little 
radioactivity got out of tmi he said 
in terms of public safety three mile island fortunately never 
amounted to much he said 
in retrospect the biggest threat to health and safety was on 
wednesday by the time we got there on friday the accident was 
over we just didnt know that he said 
the damage to the publics confidence in nuclear technology was 
another matter denton conceded 
i think peoples perception for a long time got more and more 
negative afterwards as there were allegations of adverse health 
effects he said suddenly people got interested in reporting 
events around all reactors so the perception i think of the 
public was that the industry was really about to have another tmi at 
any moment 
but to denton the accident was a wakeup call that has made the 
industry safer reactor operator qualifications have improved 
instruments provide more detail emergency response is better and 
the nrc has become more adept at managing information he said

the radioactive steam that escaped during 
the neardisaster at the three mile island power plant has long 
since dissipated but debate over the health effects of the accident 
has not 
countless pieces of data have been collected about the physical 
and psychological symptoms of nearby residents animal maladies 
plant abnormalities and other problems that might be attributed to 
radiation 
industry officials government agencies and residents have 
conducted scores of surveys and studies on the radiations effects 
the state health and agriculture departments said their studies 
found no evidence that reported animal and plant problems were due 
to the accident the plants owner general public utilities corp 
said its studies showed not enough radiation was released to cause 
the described symptoms 
marjorie and norman aamodt who lived about 50 miles from the 
plant listened to the troubles of residents for years in 1984 
they decided to survey neighborhoods close to three mile island 
about symptoms and said they found cancer deaths of up to seven 
times greater than expected 
general public utilities and the nuclear regulatory commission 
covered up the enormous suffering of people who were exposed to 
intense plumes of radiation mrs aamodt said 
the state health department disputes their contention 
dr george tokuhata director of epidemiology for the department 
has overseen about 25 studies on the effects of radiation that 
escaped mostly xenon and krypton gases and a very small quantity of 
iodine 
i do not think their worries are warranted although there are 
some disagreements about the amount of radiation released he 
said our studies show radiation release was very low 
state researchers estimate that people within fives of the plant 
were exposed to 5 to 80 millirem of radiation depending on how 
close the radioactive plumes passed on the average the areas 
residents are exposed to about 100 millirem of naturally occurring 
background radiation each year tokuhata said 
if you had 10 millirem its a fraction of one chest xray 
he said so you really do not expect a major significant health 
impact from that 
tokuhata said the main effect of the accident has been on the 
psychological wellbeing of residents 
extra medications taken by pregnant women at the time of 
the accident impacted on low birth weight babies he said that 
risk was significantly greater among those women who took extra 
medications compared to those who did not 
dr gordon macleod who took the job of state secretary of health 
just 12 days before the accident agreed that the main health 
effects appeared to be psychological ones that resulted in higher 
alcohol and drug use by residents as well as increased anxiety 
macleod however also conducted research that concluded an 
abnormally large number of babies were born with thyroid problems 
after the accident 
but macleod who is now professor of public health and clinical 
professor of medicine at the university of pittsburgh said he 
believes data will not be able to show whether radiation caused 
increased incidents of cancer or other conditions because of a 
multitude of other factors that could contribute to such diseases 
more than 2000 damage suits have been filed against general 
public utilities or the plants builders a 25 million agreement 
was reached in one class action suit filed shortly after the 
accident including 5 million to underwrite health studies 
in 1985 insurance companies representing the utility agreed to a 
1 million payment for a downs syndrome child born nine months 
after the accident and 855000 for a child who suffered cerebral 
palsy the agreements specified that the decision to settle was 
merely economic and that the children did not suffer any provable 
injuries as a result of radiation from the accident

operators of the three mile island power 
plant in pennsylvania avoided a nuclear disaster but the accident 
was a financial catastrophe for its owner general public utilities 
corp 
yet a decade later a plaque hangs in the companys lobby 
recognizing it as the 1988 electric utility of the year by the trade 
publication electric light amp power 
its been an amazing turnaround said mark luftig a utility 
analyst at the investment firm salomon brothers inc 
general public utilities lost 172 million on revenue of 149 
billion the year of the accident after paying a dividend of 120 a 
share for 1979 the company halted dividends for the next eight 
years costing stockholders an estimated 800 million its stock 
price plunged from 18 a share to a low of 337 
the company initially had to spend 24 million a month to buy 
replacement power from other utilities it also abandoned a power 
plant in the early stages of construction after spending a third of 
the expected 12 billion cost 
but the utility which provides electricity to 42 million people 
in new jersey and pennsylvania cut costs with a leaner operating 
structure and it finally won permission to restart an undamaged 
nuclear reactor at three mile island in 1985 
the company also was able to work out a costsharing plan for the 
1 billion cleanup of the damaged reactor in which it is paying 
about a tenth of the cost insurance its customers federal and 
state governments and the nuclear industry pay the rest 
by last year general public utilities had boosted its aftertax 
profit to 2838 million on 283 billion in revenue and its stock 
price topped 38 a share 
issues still facing the company are the more than 2100 personal 
injury suits pending from the accident and the need to start 
preparing for the cost of decommissioning the three mile island 
complex

on these isolated hillsides overlooking 
loch carron the dramatic quiet is interrupted by crofter angus 
macrae calling out to his herding collies in their own private 
language and by the excited bleating of sheep expecting to be fed 
here in scotlands western highlands far from the rest of the 
world a unique and ancient way of life called crofting small 
tenant farming endures despite threats from many sides new taxes 
competition from agribusiness and the encroachment of vacationers 
time is almost meaningless on this late winter day what matters 
is place 
the exterior of this life is stunning cold and rugged with 
sunshine slashing diagonally through clouds in a wide sky it 
compels thoughts of god 
macrae stands with his back to subtly colored peatcovered 
strome hill spread before him is the metalcolored loch his croft 
is 70 miles from inverness the nearest city about half the journey 
is down singletrack road its not raining for a changeanne was born 
in 1967 she now 
attends university in edinburgh the threebedroom house was built 
in 1968 macrae owns it but not the land it stands on 
we worked very hard very long hours in the first years of our 
marriage every pound we had spare we invested in our sheep 
he earned some 7 pounds 12 a week when he started out in the 
forests hauling the timber with a horse lumberjacks now make about 
100 pounds 170 the income from the croft generally matched 
macraes pay over the years 
the crofter has 35 acres of land plus some of his townships 
common and owns more than 400 cheviot sheep he sells their 
lambs in dingwall in september to other farmers 
the working day starts at 8 am the sheep must be herded and 
fed herded and dipped for delousing herded and sheared there are 
jobs to do around the place like mending fences there are 
crofters meetings to attend 
it has been a life without television restaurants traffic 
in november a leg injury forced macrae to retire early from the 
forestry commission 
now i am a fulltime crofter 
he pauses something is weighing on that poetic mind of his 
its not the new property tax that will raise the cost of 
crofting not the influx of english buying crofters homes for 
vacation cottages not the rising competition from largescale 
sheepraising in the south these are all worries but not the big 
one 
macrae went to the library in town recently he saw five people 
there he knew none of them thats whats really bothering him 
people coming from outside they may not be as willing to pass 
time with a passing stranger he said the whole way of life 
could readily disappear

with nasty allegations flying and millions of 
dollars on the line actress valerie harper and the lorimar studio 
wanted their legal battle last year resolved as quickly as possible 
but in los angeles where the courts are as congested as the 
freeways it would take five years before a civil trial could begin 
to decide whether miss harper was wrongly fired or wrongly quit the 
valeries family tv series 
the lawyers took a shortcut for 50000 they got their own 
judge bailiff clerk and court reporter for a trial held in a 
leased public courtroom before a jury selected from the public rolls 
within a year the jury awarded miss harper 185 million in 
damages and a cut in lorimars future profits that could be worth 
15 million 
in contrast the los angeles superior court jury that last month 
awarded marc christian 2175 million did so nearly four years after 
christian filed a lawsuit against former lover rock hudson alleging 
that the movie star concealed the fact he had aids the huge award 
is certain to be appealed 
with civil court systems seriously backlogged across the country 
thousands of litigants are finding out that they can afford to rent 
their own judge 
retired jurists are returning to the bench for fees from 150 to 
250 an hour companies arranging rentajudge cases are reporting 
record business and litigants and lawyers say the speedy private 
proceedings are the best thing to come along in the american legal 
system since the bill of rights 
but the proliferation of such cases has many in legal circles 
yelling objection critics say private adjudication often 
discriminates against the poor raises profound constitutional 
questions and may be luring fine judges off the bench for an early 
lucrative retirement 
im worried that were getting a twotiered system of justice 
one for the group of people who can afford to hire a judge and one 
for the group of people who cannot said american bar association 
president robert raven 
attorneys for the poor and minorities want the legal 
establishment to take a hard look at private adjudication and 
implement what they call longoverdue reforms in the public system 
no one who is powerful enough in the public system is going to 
want to change it if there are other options were getting a deluxe 
justice system for the rich and a deteriorating form for the poor 
said robert gnaizda of public advocates which provides legal 
service for the poor and minorities 
an estimated 800000 civil lawsuits will be filed in the united 
states this year 100000 of them in los angeles county where 60000 
cases are backlogged and the wait for trial routinely stretches 
three to five years the average wait nationwide is 18 months 
this legal gridlock creates an expensive waiting game that 
generally ends as lawyers fees mount and nerves crack more than 95 
percent of civil cases are settled out of court many within hours 
before the scheduled start of a trial and after years of waiting 
rentajudge firms offer an attractive alternative the wait for 
a judge is about a month many disputes are settled in a matter of 
hours and satisfaction is practically guaranteed fewer than 10 
percent of decisions are appealed 
were getting busier and busier every month said john 
trotter retired presiding justice of the california court of 
appeals and now vice president of judicial arbitration and mediation 
services in santa ana 
judicial arbitration with 80 retired judges hears more than 600 
cases a month its competitor industry leader judicate of 
philadelphia predicts it will hear 10000 cases this year up from 
4000 last year 
such cases move smoothly because many trial rules are discarded 
and both sides have agreed on the judge and on whether the judge 
will act as a mediator or issue a decision if the judge makes a 
ruling the lawyers can file an appeal in the public court system 
getting a big jump on everybody else 
we cut right to the problem said trotter we dont have 
the formalities the requirements the pretrial rigamarole of the 
public system were highly effective 
these were the benefits attorneys in the harperlorimar dispute 
had in mind when they hired retired superior court judge william 
hogoboom 
things went smoothly we selected a very competent judge were 
able to set a time schedule that we could stick to and rely on and 
set up whatever procedures were convenient said miss harpers 
attorney barry langberg 
lorimar wanted the dispute settled quickly out of fear it 
wouldnt be allowed to use the name valerie in the title while 
the suit was pending miss harper feared that allegations from 
lorimar that she was a temperamental star would keep her from 
working elsewhere 
she wanted a quick trial and we wanted a quick trial it worked 
out perfectly said lorimar attorney donald engel 
miss harpers battle with lorimar has become one of the best 
known rentajudge cases second perhaps only to the daily disputes 
aired nationally on the peoples court essentially a televised 
form of private adjudication 
but the harperlorimar trial was unique in that it had a jury and 
all the judicial trimmings most rentajudge cases cover matters 
like insurance claims or bickering between companies over trade 
secrets heard before a lone judge 
supporters of private adjudication say these disputes fall within 
the 95 percent of cases that would probably have been settled out of 
court anyway 
were really not in competition with the courts said william 
macqueen vice president of judicate what were doing is in fact 
an alternative to a settlement negotiated by the parties we are 
able to provide what people intended in the first place 
another benefit of the rentajudge system comes to litigants 
seeking to keep their trial proceedings secret unlike public trials 
in this country the news media can be barred from rentajudge 
courtrooms if both parties agree 
raven and other skeptics concede there may be a place for the 
rentajudge concept that many disputes dont have to wallow in the 
courts awaiting a trial that may not be necessary in the first 
place they also want this kind of shortcut available to everyone 
not just those who can afford it and not at the expense of the 
public court system 
the ultimate solution is to make the public system better and 
eliminate much of the demand for rentajudges raven said its 
the attorneys who should be taking the lead on this they should be 
shouting like hell

big cbsfox home video vhsbeta 8998 rated pg release 
date march 23 
 
big was just that at the box office and the reason can be 
summed up in two little words tom hanks 
for the same reason its well worth savoring this sweet if 
slightly dopey comedy all over again now that its available on home 
video 
as josh baskin the 12yearold boy who wishes he were big and 
magically gets his wish hanks has a field day hes remarkably 
endearing and believable as an innocent prepubescent adolescent 
suddenly coping with an adult body and an adult world 
watch his pricelessly goofy facial expressions while responding 
to the seductive advances of elizabeth perkins watch how he uses 
his body as he cavorts through a toy store or plays his first 
handball game in a schoolyard against a corporate rival its the 
work of a superior clown 
the screenplay by gary ross and anne spielberg isnt always up to 
hanks inspired level nor is penny marshalls direction but the 
star and a fine supporting cast carry one past the slow spots 
perkins does a good job with the rather silly and thankless role 
of the corporate moll who has slept her way up the ladder but 
sincerely falls for hanks literally boyish charm robert loggia is 
as usual splendid as the toy company czar who thinks he sees genius 
in hanks enthusiasm for toys jared rushton is winning as joshs 
best friend billy and mercedes ruehl as joshs mother shows some 
of the same manic intensity she later brought to the part of the 
jealous mafia wife in married to the mob

it happened one night launched one of hollywoods 
institutions the road movie but there are road movies and there

albert finney was a delicious treat while planes trains and 
automobiles was laborious 
what makes midnight run with charles grodin and robert deniro 
so special is the wonderful chemistry between the two actors a 
tight excellent script by george gallo and martin brests gritty 
direction 
the movie enjoyed a small following when it played movie houses 
but never quite got the recognition it deserved 
deniro always a treat to watch is a bounty hunter for a slimey 
little los angeles operation his assignment is to bring in grodin 
who has embezzled 15 million from the mob and given it to charity 
and is wanted by the fbi to be a witness against the crime boss he 
doublecrossed 
only problem government agents are hot on his trail sos the 
mob sos a rival bounty hunter who would sell his grandmother to 
bedouin mercenaries in order to get the goods 
they go by plane car freight train bus you name it

just coolin atlantic levert 
 
levert describes side 1 of just coolin as a conceptual 
funk suite and the term is unintentionally apt the five songs 
will send most listeners into a conceptual funk that will have them 
secondguessing their recordbuying habits 
in an attempt to attract a younger audience levert has made 
music for the curbside with a backbeat guaranteed to drown out all 
conversation and even honking cars the problem is it sounds like 
the same backbeat on all five songs 
monotonous is not a strong enough word the music lacks the humor 
or grit of the best rap and the street dialogue between cuts is 
lame 
side 2 sees levert revert to the ballads that helped make their 
first two albums big sellers the tunes are in the marvin gaye 
tradition the late singer is even mentioned in lets get 
romantic but again theres no variety in the tempos and the 
songs arent good enough to justify the sleepinducing pace the 
slow side is better than side 1 but so is tiffany 
the best strategy for levert at this point would be to find some 
stronger material put out another album quickly and announce they 
were just foolin about just coolin refunds would be nice too

i wanna have some fun jive samantha fox 
 
on the cover of this her third album we find miss fox pretty 
much clothed which must mean the former british pinup queen is 
getting serious about this music thing what she isnt getting is 
much better 
oh all right most of this is harmless enough i guess she has 
a serviceable if unspectacular voice and she has an army of 
producers behind her creating synthopop dance music the likes of 
which donna summer did an awful lot better 10 years ago 
but theres one track in this morass that sinks below the others 
a blasphemous synthedup ruination of the dusty springfield classic 
i only want to be with you whoever is responsible should be 
forced to listen to the original or to southside johnnys soulful 
remake repeatedly while doing some prison time somewhere gaaaaak

hold an old friends hand mca tiffany 
 
teenage pop phenom tiffany is older now all of 17 as she 
follows up her immensely successful but shallow debut album recorded 
when she was just 14 
people will probably like hold an old friends hand just as 
much but just what is it about this adolescent girl that inspires 
such adoration 
the 11 tracks here are the stuff of teenage girl talk yearning 
for boys trying to be noticed by them feeling rejected when one 
stops calling and always keeping in mind that a girl doesnt need a 
boys attentions to validate her 
all this has been done before in a much more stylish manner 
than the accumulation of technopop brights and syrupy balladeering 
engineered by tiffany and her producermentor george tobin 
but the hooks as on all this time and radio romance are 
mindlessly catchy and tiffany has a serviceable voice that often 
recalls stevie nicks especially in the lower registers 
some songs such as ill be the girl dimly echo the girl 
groups of the early 1960s even to the point of having spoken verses 
perhaps it is the simple teenage romance lyrics tiffany sings 
and the california wholesomeness she exudes that draws fans to her 
like moths she is the antithesis of the rebellious youth whose 
image is projected by many rock acts instead shes everyones 
perfect daughter 
tiffany may be simply trying to reflect her age the 1980s a 
return to conformism and a distaste for experimentation of any kind

the actress made her film debut in 1964 then got sidetracked 
into offbroadway plays and underground movies many of which 
displayed ample views of the admirable kirkland frame she later 
played minor roles in films from the sting to the incredible 
shrinking woman 
a few years ago she campaigned for a lowbudget drama anna 
adding pounds and aging herself to fit the role of a faded czech 
film actress adrift in new york she won the role and the 
nomination and no one was more tickled than she with such 
recognition 
now four films later she retains her native vivacity 
i got to turn down 10 to 15 scripts right away because they 
all came at once the 44yearold actress said i chose the 
parts i did because frankly they gave me chances to make real 
contributions some of the other scripts may have been bigstudio 
deals but they were smaller parts 
a lot of people said dont work wait until you get the next 
honest script i didnt want to be overly idealistic about that i 
wasnt sure when the next honest script whatever that is would 
come i wanted to keep working and so i have been working nonstop 
the starring roles are in melanie rose paint it black 
and cold feet she also played a cameo role in revenge with 
kevin costner and anthony quinn 
cold feet which will be released in april is a modern 
western filmed in montana and arizona with kirkland keith 
carradine tom waits and rip torn playing with such an eccentric 
group she said was very much like being a marx sister 
she chose cold feet because i was dying to do light comedy 
after such a tragic story as anna 
i also got to look very pretty which i wasnt able to do in 
anna i practically signed my life on the line saying they could 
do a raging bull number on me otherwise i wouldnt get the 
part the reference is to the critically acclaimed film about 
boxer jake lamotta for which robert deniro added 60 pounds 
revenge also took her to a rugged location in durango mexico 
she was impressed with kevin costner hes so human hes so 
real i pointed out a few things in the script that could be 
reworked right away he went to tony scott the director and said 
could sally and i improvise for you tony was wonderful in the 
sense that he let us try new things 
sally kirklands ambition came early growing up in new york city 
the daughter of a fashion editor she became acquainted with the 
rich and famous an early mentor was legendary producer david o 
selznick who predicted she would become a star but he also 
cautioned that she would be a late bloomer 
the frustration of waiting caused a collapse in 1964 
i think i had a breakdown she recalled i had so many 
wideeyed dreams and one after another things started going wrong 
but when i came back i had learned to meditate i meditate a 
couple of hours now i do an incredible amount of exercise hatha 
yoga and dance i dance like a nut 
i like to think that i have the body of a 20yearold and the 
energy of a 15yearold so the minute anything happens in the 
business like rejection i go run a mile swim a mile do three 
hours backtoback of hatha yoga something very physical or i 
create a psychodrama session with a couple of actors and scream it 
out i dont sit on it 
kirkland said the oscar nomination was like a dream 
i was so high i was like a little 12yearold so excited that 
i dont think my feet were on the ground my feet are back on the 
ground now and im still kind of amazed 
i ran into a bunch of young actors yesterday and they told me 
how their acting teachers used me as an example in class that 
amazed me i can remember when i used to look to kim stanley 
geraldine page and a lot of wonderful broadway actresses i thought 
oh god some day i hope i can act as well as them 
she admits that losing the oscar to cher was a bummer since she 
had been dreaming of a darkhorse victory but characteristically 
the depression didnt last long 
i tell young actors make sure you do something else besides 
acting for me it was painting and teaching i think that if you do 
acting and nothing else when youre out of work you tend to turn 
everything in against yourself and reject yourself she said 
if you have anything else you enjoy doing particularly of the 
arts writing directing producing painting music do it 
because unless you can have fun with the game of the business the 
business is tough its tough no matter how you look at it 
particularly for women although thats changing

composer john cage was recently reading 
his computergenerated lecture at harvard university when a young 
woman wearing a leather jacket and a saucy smile strode onto the 
stage and drank the glass of water that had been placed at the 
speakers side 
cage ignored her 
some in the audience of about 400 people decided it was part of 
the act it wasnt later the mysterious interloper tami lum a 
student at simons rock college who made the 2hour trip from great 
barrington for this moment said she was thirsty and didnt think 
cage would mind 
the audacious john cage has that effect on people 
at 76 years old cage ranks among the most controversial 
composers of the 20th century and the anarchist king of the 
avantgarde this school year harvard university is honoring him 
with the post of charles eliot norton professor of poetry his 
syllabus consists of a series of six lectures and six corresponding 
seminars 
the norton chair honors contributors to poetry broadly defined 
and since 1926 has provided its occupants with the salary and rank 
of full professor for one academic year cages predecessors in the 
norton pantheon include leonard bernstein igor stravinsky frank 
stella lionel trilling and thornton wilder 
harvard isnt alone in celebrating cage there will be other cage 
concerts around boston and the boston symphony orchestra and boston 
musica viva have commissioned works by cage to be performed this 
year 
last year he was elected to the 50member american academy of 
arts and sciences 
such are the crowning honors of a long career spent rattling 
people out of the ruts of convention 
best known for his experiments with random or chance music the 
multifaceted los angelesborn artist and only child of an inventor 
was introduced to music at age 8 when his aunt began teaching him 
the piano 
by 18 he was composing music and went on to study with another 
musical revolutionary arnold schoenberg in 1949 he won the first 
of many such accolades when the national academy of arts and letters 
honored him with an award for extending the boundaries of music 
a theatrical event he organized in 1952 during which various 
artists simultaneously performed independently is considered the 
model for the unstructured happenings of the 1960s cage has 
produced works in europe and japan written for films and is the 
author of 12 books he also has published collections of his 
etchings and drawings a series of 52 cage watercolors is scheduled 
for an exhibition next year in washington 
in what he does there is no ranking hes the one said pia 
gilbert a composer who teaches aesthetics at the julliard school in 
new york 
he really has been the pioneer and has been consistent with 
what he has pursued with an amazing youthful approach always 
discovering always continuing 
while she prefers more control in her own compositions gilbert 
has been touched by the artist she has known for three decades he 
has influenced everyone who has been around him she said he 
has influenced me in freeing my thinking what he does is 
liberate people 
at the start of one of his recent norton lectures at harvard 
cage explained his lecture and himself with a fourpage exposition 
the document had a runon title of 16 words not separated by spaces 
and starting with method and ending with performance in the 
written explanation he said his purpose in life discovered nearly 
40 years ago was the exploration of nonintention 
furthermore he added i did not know immediately what i was 
doing nor after all these years have i found much out 
the raw clay of the lectures are 487 quotations from such 
assorted sources as british philosopher ludwig wittgenstein 
naturalist and writer henry david thoreau the writer james joyce 
the wall street journal and the christian science monitor 
he concludes elliptically all six lectures have been planned 
in detail but i dont know what theyll be ill find that out by 
writing them 
sitting through one hour and 40 minutes of the excercise required 
a certain devotion 
the slender professor dressed in blue workshirt dungarees and 
black leather running shoes sat immobile as he intoned his piece 
for 71 pages he leaned into a microphone across a long low table 
and out of his mouth in a reedy soothing voice poured a string of 
words and phrases at random 
cage has been up to this sort of thing for a long time 
in 1951 in imaginary landscape cage wrote a piece for 12 
radios and 24 musicians during the work each radio is tuned to a 
different station making the outcome unpredictable and each 
performance unique 
you have to just let it wash over you liz lee advised as she 
was leaving after one hour the 20yearold biology major came over 
from nearby massachusetts institute of technology to hear and 
experience cage its kind of interesting the point i get out of 
it is all words have their own connotations 
less enthralled was her companion ray parker 24 a jazz 
musician in this academic enclave across the charles river from 
boston i see this as more of an experiment im not really a big 
fan of this kind of stuff art without form is nothing 
back inside the auditorium cage was still intoning 
the state department said its antipakistan policy would have 
peace in sharing in burma 
mistakenly a camera 
around the room in the darkening light of sunset some faces 
intently watched cage heads bobbed in agreement others stretched 
out in helpless sleep that testified to the lectures soporific 
effects 
cage enunciated every word and placed emphasis on certain lines 
my composing not to supply old laws 
the lecture ended with tumultuous applause and a shy happy grin 
from cage who crept away out back 
gertrude freedman was ecstatic the 78yearold antinuclear 
activist considered the lecture right up her political alley he 
mentioned every single trouble spot and the nonsensical things our 
government is doing all over the world he purposely didnt make 
sense 
it breaks down my usual way of interpreting the world said 
peter warren a jazz musician 
cages unconventional lecture he said opens you up to a lot 
of possibilities this is what im trying to do with my music what 
hes trying to convey is theres an underlying meaning underneath 
the random processes

lamont dozier wrote his first song when he was 11 
years old taking encouragement from a detroit schoolteacher 
he handed in a poem at school and the teacher put it on the 
board usually the teacher would change the poem every month he 
recalled my poem stayed on the board six months that stimulated 
me a lot to continue my writing that lady did a lot for me later 
i managed to plunk out some melody on the piano to put with it 
now 47 doziers supervising his 9yearold son beau in a los 
angeles recording studio hes a good little singer and a good 
little songwriter dozier and singersongwriterdrummeractor phil

it out of my mind i hadnt entertained any ideas of winning it my 
heart just went boom boom it was like i was going to pass out or 
something 
i was never nominated for anything ive had gold and platinum

hollanddozierholland which rose to fame at motown records dozier 
and the holland brothers eddie and brian were responsible for 
how sweet it is you cant hurry love and stop in the name 
of love among others their biggest selling song was you keep 
me hanging on a hit for the supremes vanilla fudge and kim wilde 
but dozier isnt bitter that he wasnt nominated for awards 
before without sounding goodygoody or something im a 
songwriter just to hear my songs on the radio is reward enough as 
corny as it may sound 
im thrilled about all of this the main thing is making the 
product good if its not good i dont want an award for it first 
and most important is the public and what they think of what i do 
thats who im writing it for 
hollanddozierholland left motown in 1968 and ended their 
partnership in 1972 because dozier wanted to pursue a singing 
career ill take another serious stab at it this year toward the

on broadway im the creator of the book and about 14 pieces of 
music for it ive had meetings with andrew lloyd webbers really 
useful theater company warner bros has signed me to a major 
publishing deal because of it

man in the middle because of the hollanddozierholland billing 
but he turned that down there are some pages i want to fill in 
first im just starting 
collins is the biggest star with whom dozier has collaborated he 
recounted their meeting i went backstage at one of his shows 
here you know how you do i didnt know if hed know what i did i 
was a little bit reluctant to take up his time 
when i went in an atlantic records publicity guy said i have 
lamont dozier here he swung around and literally came and grabbed 
and hugged me it just blew me away come to find out he collects 
motown memorabilia and i was one of his favorite writers he wanted

uncool 
shortly afterwards he called me did i have material for an 
eric clapton album august he was producing i sent him one 
thing he called again did i have another one i dropped off a tape 
at the studio i was driving in my driveway and my wife barbara 
said phils on the line i heard the music in the background

five hours a day ive written over 700 songs and have some 400 or 
500 unpublished and unrecorded i make demos in my home

california he dropped by the house he wanted to talk about a 
film buster he had decided to do he said he didnt want to have 
anything to do with the music he wanted to make a serious attempt 
at acting

a feeling of what i was going for i had titles i hummed the 
melodies all of a sudden he wanted to get involved he decided to 
write the lyrics he wanted busters point of view

el doctorow may be new yorks state writer 
but the author is thinking about spending some time away 
doctorow has been living for 20 years in the vintage 1906 new 
rochelle house that inspired the bestseller and film ragtime 
but with his three children all grown he and his wife helen think 
a change of scenery might be in order 
new york does mean a lot to me but weve been talking about 
living out west or in europe said doctorow who was recently 
awarded the new york writers institute edith wharton citation of 
merit 
wherever the writer may settle his novels will be remembered for 
their evocative look at new york in the first half of the 20th 
century open up one of doctorows books and be prepared harry 
houdini may come to visit emma goldman might offer advice on love 
and admiral peary may invite readers along on a trip to the north 
pole 
look up and see the mighty hindenburg zeppelin float by grab a 
piece of paper and enter a contest for the typical american boy 
hop on the subway and discover the town of tomorrow at the worlds 
fair sneak on a train and discover america 
but be careful bad things are everywhere ruthless business 
tycoons palefaced thugs antisemitic punks and legendary 
gangsters such as dutch schultz who loomed large in the bronx of 
the 1930s a world of sweet potato vendors junk hustlers and 
capable boys like billy bathgate the narrator and adventurer of 
doctorows latest novel billy bathgate 
i think billy is a rhapsodist the author said in an 
interview he has enormous zest and the ability to be thrilled 
billy really takes the world in he embraces it all no matter how 
ugly hideous or bizarre 
doctorow a native of the bronx himself returns in billy 
bathgate to his childhood setting the backdrop for earlier works 
including loon lake and worlds fair billy bathgate the 
authors alter ego lives with his unstable and lonely mother 
and dreams of meeting schultz who makes a cameo appearance in 
worlds fair 
one day schultzs packard pulls up in front of a local warehouse 
and billy has his chance he impresses the gangster with his 
juggling act a galilean maneuver that involves two rubber 
balls a navel orange an egg and a black stone the performance is 
greeted with applause and a crisp 10 bill from a laughing schultz 
the resourceful bathgate eases himself into the gangsters 
entourage winning the confidence of abbadabba berman the 
syndicates financial wizard and having a wild affair with 
schultzs mistress 
the myth of schultz is what i deal with doctorow said but 
he does really get involved with him in not a casual way hes so 
attracted to the idea of schultz the reigning gangster hero of his 
neighborhood 
but the gangster has clearly seen better days with prohibition 
repealed bootlegging is no longer profitable an aggressive young 
district attorney named thomas e dewey is hot on his trail and 
schultz has become careless committing murder at the slightest 
provocation he is eventually gunned down at a new jersey hideout 
names and places often repeat themselves in doctorows novels 
with the author citing a sort of repertory company of souls who 
make their appearance in each book but the writing covers a 
variety of styles 
ragtime is breezy and crisp with short snappy sentences 
moving events along lives of the poets six short stories and a 
novella is an experiment in minimalism as doctorow departs from the 
rich language of his other novels to give a stark version of life in 
the 1980s 
loon lake and billy bathgate use a streamofconsciouness 
narrative that speeds up slows down and races ahead like bumper 
cars at an amusement park in billy bathgate doctorow writes of 
billys initiation with guns 
and then what happens if you dont make it yours you are dead 
you have created the circumstance but it has its own freestanding 
rage available to anyone and this is what you take into yourself 
like an anger that theyve done this to you the people who are 
staring at your gun that its their intolerable crime to be the 
people you are waving this gun at 
billy bathgate adds to doctorows gallery of young heros from 
loon lake and worlds fair the boys all behave very 
differently but some common themes emerge 
the stories are sentimental educations about young people 
learning the ways of the world and their own emotions doctorow 
said 
edgar lawrence doctorow was born in 1931 the son of david r 
doctorow who sold records and music equipment and rose doctorow a 
pianist while attending the bronx high school of science he worked 
on the literary magazine dynamo and went to major in 
philosophy at kenyon college in ohio 
in the late 50s he read screenplays at columbia pictures and was 
later hired as an editor with the new american library his first 
two novels the western welcome to hard times and big as 
life a sciencefiction story were written in his spare time as 
doctorow often put in 20hour work days 
in 1969 he began writing full time and two years later came out 
with the book of daniel a critically acclaimed story inspired 
by the lives of julius and ethel rosenberg members of the communist 
party who were executed in 1953 for selling atomic secrets to the 
soviets 
ragtime a critical and commercial success came out in 1975 
it was a montage of life in new york at the turn of the century 
doctorow received the national book critics circle award and an arts 
and letters award from the american academy and national institute 
for arts in 1986 he received the national book award for worlds 
fair 
i dont believe in literature as an elitist taste doctorow 
said my great ideal of this sort of thing is dickens who was 
read avidly by people who read newspapers and monthly magazines 
thats my idea of the way society and writers should relate 
billy bathgate has given the author the will to leave his 
beloved bronx for good it is history that pig biting into the 
hearts secrets doctorow wrote in the book of daniel 
lamenting the transformation of his native bronx from peaceful 
getaway to crowded borough 
doctorow sees his next book as something huge 
i see it as something that will be some way of saying 
everything that has to be said i have a compulsion to find a form 
for so many disparate things books leave me rather exhausted and 
completed

there were times when gospel music 
veteran gary mcspadden would show up on the set of the ptl show only 
to be bumped off the guest list because the religious program had 
filled its hour 
then when ptl host jim bakker left the program as the result of 
a sex scandal the show asked the oncespurned mcspadden was asked 
to save the show by becoming the new host he became the new jim 
bakker the most visible celebrity on the troubled show in fort 
mill sc for about six months in 1987 
known as the gentleman of gospel music the 46yearold 
mcspadden still reflects these days about his experiences on the 
show at a time when national attention was focused on religious 
programs and fundraising and the troubles of jim and tammy bakker 
i was a fence walker he said i had the privilege of just 
opening my heart and interviewing people the joy for me was 
creating some stability in all that chaos 
the difficult part for me was knowing not what to say i was 
concerned i might make a big gaffe and contribute to some of the 
problems that was the touchy part for me 
mcspadden who joined the show as part of the rescue effort by 
the rev jerry falwell said he harbors no animosity toward bakker 
i pray for him i hope they he and his wife find themselves 
at a point where they can minister the gospel out of the hurts that 
they have felt 
i hope that out of all this there comes a sense that the church 
is very much alive and well he said i see a vibrancy maybe we 
had gotten a little slothful of the discipline of our personal 
lives the church is only as strong as you and me 
mcspadden aligned with falwell in trying to keep the show alive 
left the program when falwell dropped his association with it the 
revamped program is now known as heritage today 
i watch it on the satellite dish said mcspadden a gospel 
music singer writer producer and publisher who has been a member 
of the oak ridge quartet later country musics oak ridge boys the 
statesmen the imperials and the bill gaither trio 
a former 95aweek singer who spent part of his honeymoon riding 
a bus to make a gospel appearance mcspadden said his stint as host 
was good but he felt uncomfortable raising money 
there seems to be a black hole in christian tv where the money 
goes he said i dont know what that is maybe the guys at cbs 
nbc and abc know where the money goes it is expensive to do tv and 
money that comes in seems to disappear 
i never felt like i had the desire to create the huge 
conglomerate it takes to make christian tv go on it was interesting 
to me that i could provide some stability 
mcspadden who interrupted his singing career to help his father 
in ministering a nondenominational church for 10 years in fort 
worth texas said he hopes the scandals involving tv evangelists 
are over 
i pray for jimmy swaggart too when this all began i started 
praying for them my wife and i asked god to sort all this out i 
hate to see anything happen to the church it has been my life he 
said 
id like to put a period at the end of all these things that 
have happened these past few years and just say its over these 
men have asked forgiveness they are sorry lets go on thats what 
ought to happen 
he said gospel music has suffered a sales slowdown in the past 
few years but he doesnt know if church scandals have contributed to 
it 
i think there comes with that a certain amount of distrust 
mcspadden said maybe rightly so we can all look back and see the 
elmer gantry movie we can all probably see from our childhood where 
some pastor has failed 
for me its made me look at my own accountability

its 8 oclock on a holiday evening and about a 
dozen people wait in the lobby of boston city hospitals emergency 
room some slumped in the vinylcovered chairs some pacing 
fretfully 
behind the swinging doors emergency chief dr peter moyer is 
called to the puzzling case of a car accident victim who has only 
slight injuries but slips so deeply into unconsciousness he can 
barely be roused by two physicians 
have you taken any drugs doctors ask cocaine heroin 
marijuana 
its a question that has become more and more commonplace in 
emergency rooms already burdened by increased patient loads 
there is an emergency in the emergency room right now in not 
only new york and boston but around the country and for a variety of 
reasons said ken raske president of the greater new york 
hospital association 
drugs and their side effects of aids violence and psychiatric 
disorders play a role in the problems plaguing bigcity emergency 
rooms raske said 
from 1986 to 1987 according to the national institute on drug 
abuse cocainerelated cases in emergency rooms increased 122 
percent in the district of columbia 86 percent in both boston and 
atlanta 80 percent in detroit 73 percent in chicago 53 percent in 
minneapolis 50 percent in texas and 39 percent in new york city 
heroinrelated cases also increased in many cities but not as 
dramatically 
the principal reason is the change in the typical cocaine user 
and the changes that have occurred within the cocaine epidemic 
said dr mark gold director of research at fair oaks hospital in 
summit nj 
the typical cocaine user in 1983 was a collegeeducated man in 
his 30s who earned more than 25000 a year and snorted the drug 
gold said by 1987 only 16 percent were collegeeducated most took 
the drug by the more potent methods of sniffing vapors or injection 
and most were unemployed and under 30 
in new york from 1985 to 1987 hospital stays increased 15 
percent for substance abuse patients according to a study by the 
united hospital fund and the bigel insitute for health policy at 
brandeis university 
counting the number of overdoses is only half the picture there 
are also accidents caused by clouded senses and violence associated 
with soured drug deals gold said some of the coroners report 
cocainerelated deaths and include a person who has cocaine in his 
blood and a bullet in his head 
at boston city most of the cocaine abuse is intravenous moyer 
said the emergency department also treats a high percentage of 
violent trauma largely due to its innercity location about half 
of it believed to be drugrelated 
about 40 percent of the intravenous drug users seen at boston 
citys er have tested positive for the aids virus moyer said 
efforts to stem the rising tide of drug abuse comes at a time 
when emergency rooms already face increased patient loads partly 
because of the reduced role of the traditional family doctor and 
partly because there are more people who cant afford a private 
doctor 
its really providing a major backlog in the emergency 
department system said diane howard director of the american 
hospital associations division of ambulatory care and health 
promotion 
emergency departments are caught between a growing number of 
patients and a shrinking number of hospital beds due to pressures to 
lower hospital stays and decrease insurance costs said dr 
charlotte yeh a member of the board of directors of the american 
college of emergency physicians 
we in the emergency department basically we never say 
no were caught in the position where we will always see patients 
and even though we can do the initial care the initial 
stabilization we dont always have a place where we can turn that 
patient over to theres a growing bulge in the system said yeh 
chief of the emergency department of newtonwellesley hospital in 
the boston suburb of newton 
the bottom line is that emergency care is being squeezed 
raske said the real loser here is the patient

inside a small motor home joanne 
pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse mary perez inserted a needle 
into the vein above her forearm drawing blood into a tube for a 
diabetes test 
as her daughters watched pierluissi 24 said it was for them 
as much as for herself that she agreed to be tested for the deadly 
killer of hispanics 
twelve million americans have some form of diabetes but it most 
prevalent among minorities especially native americans blacks and 
hispanics hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes 
as the general population and 40 percent of the 700000 victims in 
texas are mexicanamerican 
more than 150000 americans die from diabetes each year another 
150000 deaths are diabetesrelated according to the american 
diabetes association 
no one really knows what sparks it but researchers believe 
hispanics could hold the key san antonio the nations ninth 
largest city with a population that is 50 percent hispanic is 
becoming the base for diabetes studies 
san antonios hispanic makeup led dr ralph defronzo to abandon 
his prestigious position as a yale university diabetes researcher 
and persuade his fourmember team to relocate to the university of 
texas health science center 
epidemiologist dr michael stern has devoted 10 years to studying 
hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of the most common 
form which develops mostly in obese adults over 40 who may have a 
family history of the disease 
stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him 
closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease and to a 
screening test 
researchers believe that poor hispanics diets of cheap 
processed foods lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention 
either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors increases 
their risk of acquiring diabetes 
educating elementaryschoolage children about healthy diets 
would help reduce the number of diabetes cases defronzo said if 
you have a 65yearold mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her 
to go out and jog five miles monday wednesday and friday she is 
going to laugh at you

aly elshiekh envisions astronauts on a 
threeyear trip to mars knitting themselves a space station 
using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels beams boxes 
and practically any other shape 
we believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and 
the machinery were developing they would be able to literally make 
the space stations they will need as they go said elshiekh a 
mechanical engineer at working in north carolina state universitys 
textiles school 
elshiekh and his students are developing machinery to braid long 
strands of ceramic fibers such fibers bonded with epoxy also will 
form heat shields and many of the parts in the vessel that carries 
people to mars the parts will withstand speeds of 50000 mph and 
temperatures of at least 4000 degrees 
while much of his work relates to the mars mission research 
center here elshiekh sees a big future for composite materials 
like ceramic fibers 
the day may very well come when you are driving around with car 
engine parts of ceramic fiber he said adding that the 
vibrationdamping properties of the materials also would make them 
good for torsion bars in cars 
we also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric 
in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods he 
said it is stronger than steel does not rust and would not wear 
away the road would not deteriorate 
the fibers including kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests 
also could be used to make some body parts and elshiekh is working 
with duke university researchers on ceramic stents collapsible 
braces for arteries 
the possibilities are limitless said elshiekh who can 
produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have 
openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them the 
big problem is cost and thats why were working on this automated 
machinery

its 8 pm and a dozen people wait in the lobby of 
boston city hospitals emergency room behind the swinging doors 
dr peter moyer is called to a car accident victim who has only 
slight injuries but slips so deeply into unconsciousness he can 
barely be roused by two physicians 
have you taken any drugs doctors ask cocaine heroin 
marijuana 
its a question that has become more and more commonplace in 
emergency rooms already burdened by increased patient loads 
there is an emergency in the emergency room right now in not 
only new york and boston but around the country and for a variety of 
reasons said ken raske president of the greater new york 
hospital association 
drugs and their side effects of aids violence and psychiatric 
disorders play a role in the problems plaguing bigcity emergency 
rooms raske said 
from 1986 to 1987 according to the national institute on drug 
abuse cocainerelated cases in emergency rooms increased 122 
percent in the district of columbia 86 percent in both boston and 
atlanta 80 percent in detroit 73 percent in chicago 53 percent in 
minneapolis 50 percent in texas and 39 percent in new york city 
efforts to stem the rising tide of drug abuse comes at a time 
when emergency rooms already face increased patient loads partly 
because of the reduced role of the traditional family doctor and 
partly because there are more people who cant afford a private 
doctor 
its really providing a major backlog in the emergency 
department system said diane howard director of the american 
hospital associations division of ambulatory care and health 
promotion 
the bottom line is that emergency care is being squeezed 
raske said the real loser here is the patient

condom instructions written in spanish are too 
complex to be understood by many hispanics in the united states a 
researcher says 
the use of condoms has assumed a prominent role in the national 
strategy for prevention of aids particularly in highrisk hispanic 
communities in the northeast said robert o valdez an assistant 
professor of public health at the university of california los 
angeles 
yet a number of hispanics are not literate in english or 
spanish the result is a public health dilemma because many hispanic 
people are unable to read information such as condom instructions 
he said 
only 13 of 25 condom brands purchased in los angeles included 
instructions in spanish and all of those required reading ability 
at the ninth to 11thgrade level which is well above the average 
for most hispanics in the united states said valdez said 
the study by valdez and other researchers was published recently 
in the hispanic journal of behavioral sciences they cited a 1976 
national chicano survey which found that onethird of us 
hispanics between age 15 and 45 said they were illiterate in english 
and nearly 40 percent in spanish 
an earlier ucla study found collegelevel reading ability is 
required to understand most condom instructions written in english

pygmy octopuses usually live in shells 
abandoned by other sea creatures but a ecologist janet voight was 
able to study the small animals by luring them into empty beer 
bottles 
they decided the beer bottles are just as good as shells 
said janet voight a university of arizona doctoral student 
unlike the giant pacific octopus which weighs about 50 pounds 
the pacific pygmy octopus weighs between threequarters of an ounce 
and 1 ounces it lives throughout the gulf of california 
particularly in shellrich northern gulf areas of cholla bay near 
sonora mexico 
using brown beer bottles voight was able to trap and study 800 
octopuses during a year she removed each animal from its bottle 
anesthetized weighed and measured it and checked its reproductive 
status the octopuses then were revived and released 
the study helped voight determine that pygmy octopuses have a 
lifespan of 5 to eight months increasing their weight a 
thousandfold from 00141 ounces when hatched to adult weight 
averaging 141 ounces 
since they grow so rapidly researchers are investigating using 
pygmy octopuses for food voight said

an operation that can treat tubal pregnancy on 
an outpatient basis is less painful and costly and just as safe and 
effective as major abdominal surgery usually used for the problem a 
study concludes 
about 2 percent of all pregnancies in the united states are tubal 
pregnancies in which a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of a 
fallopian tube instead of making its way to the uterus the fetus 
will die within three months of conception but must be removed 
earlier to protect the mothers health said dr michael vermesh an 
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university 
of southern california 
both surgical methods involve removing the doomed fetus through 
an incision in the fallopian tube under general anesthesia 
in the standard surgical method laparotomy access to the tube 
is gained through a sizable incision in the abdomen in a 
laparoscopy a tubular viewing device called a laparoscope is 
inserted through a small incision in the navel while the surgery is 
performed with instruments inserted through another tube inserted 
through a second incision just below the public hair line 
in the usc study 60 patients were randomly assigned to received 
either laparotomy or laparoscopy laparotomy patients required a 
threeday hospital stay and spent four weeks disabled at home 
laparoscopy patients could go home the day of surgery or a day 
later and resumed normal activities in a few days 
pain and discomfort are greatly reduced with laparoscopy and 
savings from shorter hospital stays averaged 1500 per patient 
vermesh said 
length of surgery degree of complications and preservation of 
fertility were about the same for both groups 
laparoscopy is suitable only for pregnancies in which the 
fallopian tube hasnt ruptured and the fetus is small enough no 
more than about 1 inches across to be removed through the 
surgical tube vermesh said 
only a handful of medical centers offer laparoscopy for tubal 
pregnancy although the laparoscope is widely used for diagnosing 
such pregnancies and other pelvic abnormalities

computeraided design techniques will let 
dentists take 3d pictures of cavities and teeth and turn out 
fillings in a matter of minutes without the cost of laboratory work 
researchers say 
you can do a restoration in about 45 minutes to an hour 
compared with two appointments of considerably greater length using 
current methods said dr harald heymann acting chairman of 
operative dentistry at the university of north carolina at chapel 
hill it certainly will enable a large part of the aesthetic 
restoration being done today to be done right there chairside 
instead of taking a physical mold of the tooth and giving a 
patient a temporary filling while waiting for laboratory work a 
dentist will aim a small video camera at the cavity snap a picture 
and waitthe digitized image is fed into a milling machine that 
makes a filling in minutes 
the process is expected to be approved by the food and drug 
administration within a year heymann said this procedure offers 
primarily an advantage in that its aesthetic and for the dentist 
there wouldnt be a lab bill involved it would be very cost 
effective 
the software and hardware are being constantly improved he said 
five 10 years from now were probably going to look back on this 
model the way we look at a model t after looking at todays 
modernday ford 
heymanns experiments are focusing primarily on improving the fit 
of the computergenerated ceramics and following up on people who 
receive them 
its not an experimental thing at all in terms of dentistry 
he said youre interested in the performance of whatever 
restoration or material youre replacing over time

american express co will lose a key strategist 
and likely future chairman when louis v gerstner jr its president 
and head of its crown jewels creditcard and travel subsidiary 
takes charge of rjr nabisco inc next month analysts say 
as chairman and chief executive officer of the travel related 
services co division gerstner was behind the expansion of american 
express lucrative creditcard market share through new products 
like the platinum and optima cards and oversaw the successful 
membership has its privileges promotion 
his unit which also is responsible for travelers checks and 
travel service offices consistently has been the most profitable 
for american express and in the entire financialservices industry 
in last years fourth quarter the subsidiarys earnings rose 18 
percent to a quarterly record 1835 million 
gerstners departure announced monday after 11 years at 
american express will mean chairman james d robinson iii will have 
to shoulder a larger portion of the daily activities now handled by 
gerstner and leaves in doubt the choice of successor to robinson 
analysts said 
robinson said he will assume the title of president of the parent 
company while aldo papone president and chief operating officer of 
travel related services will become chief executive officer of the 
subsidiary 
in all indication he gerstner would have become chairman when 
mr robinson moved into retirement said perrin long analyst with 
lipper analytical services corp 
he gerstner gets to run his own show now faster than he would 
have had he stayed at american express since theres only a five 
or six year difference between he and mr robinson 
gerstner 47 and robinson 53 had formed a highly effective 
management team analysts said with robinson establishing broad 
corporate goals and gerstner carrying them out and setting 
marketshare guidelines 
analysts said it was unlikely that gerstners departure would 
have a major impact on american express over the next few years 
since the companys longrange plans already are in place 
but looking down the road it will later depend on who emerges 
in the next generation of leadership said adam l starr an 
analyst with first manhattan corp 
starr noted that gerstner lately had been pushing for american 
express to focus more on the crown jewels travel related 
services and less on highrisk businesses including the shearson 
lehman hutton brokerage unit 
shearsons earnings have been hurt since the october 1987 stock 
market crash in the last two years american express has cut its 
stake in shearson from 100 percent to 62 percent 
gerstner joined american express in 1978 as president of the 
american express card division and the next year was named 
president of the travel related services group responsible for 
american express cards travelers checks and travel service offices 
when travel related services became a subsidiary in 1982 
gerstner became its chairman and chief executive officer he became 
president of the parent company in 1985 
during gerstners career at american express the companys card 
membership rose from 86 million to 307 million as the card became 
accepted in more retail stores worldwide 
gerstners move came as somewhat of a surprise to analysts 
because of his lack of experience in the food and tobacco 
industries rjrs core businesses 
but those with whom he is closely associated said gerstner 
possessed the skills needed to run a company such as rjr which 
remains in a state of transition following its record 25 billion 
acquisition by buyout specialists kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
earlier this year 
a good manager can work in any industry said starr hes 
known as a real stickler for quality of service and products 
gerstner will succeed f ross johnson who resigned feb 9 as 
rjrs chief executive after leading an unsuccessful takeover bid for 
the atlantabased company he will assume his new post april 3 
analysts said gerstner faces several challenges at rjr including 
deciding quickly what changes if any should be made due to the 
buyout 
rjr has indicated it will sell some lines of business to deal 
with antitrust concerns raised by the federal government but the 
extent of any further restructuring such as other divestitures or 
cutbacks is unknown 
gerstner also must develop strategies to address rjrs loss in 
tobacco market share said marc cohen an analyst with sanford c 
bernstein in new york 
among rjr nabiscos operating companies are rj reynolds 
tobacco nabisco brands del monte foods and planters lifesavers

speculation is rife that striketorn eastern 
airlines will introduce fares as low as 49 one way between new york 
and florida in time for easter and students spring break to lure 
back passengers 
but before you grab your sunglasses and beach towel consider 
this fares that cheap usually carry risks and these could have 
plenty 
the experience over the weekend with easterns special 12 
northeast shuttle fare which drew throngs of bargainhunting fliers 
and stranded hundreds in three airports could be a good example 
even if the cheap seats to florida are reserved there may not be 
enough pilots to fly the planes and it might not be possible to 
book through a travel agent industry observers said monday 
most eastern pilots and flight attendants have honored the strike 
by the airlines machinists union which entered its 11th day today 
miamibased eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection 
from creditors thursday citing a cash crisis stemming from the 
labor walkout 
in an attempt to shore up its crumbling market share analysts 
believe eastern may expand its cutrate strategy from the shuttle to 
its primary market florida as travelers begin flocking south for 
spring holidays industry speculation points to a 49 oneway ticket 
between new york and florida which would be about half the 
prevailing discount fare 
but experts cautioned that any farecutting probably would be 
shortlived and unlikely to be matched by easterns competitors 
whose florida flights are nearly fully booked 
furthermore some travel agents may refuse to sell the cheap 
eastern tickets fearing the risk to passengers of flying on a 
strikebound carrier and a potential deluge of refund requests if 
flights are cancelled 
i cant afford to have clients come back to me with 
complaints said david perelman president of dms travel in 
manhattan its a great deal if you can get on a plane 
suzanne jensen a spokeswoman for uniglobe travel international 
inc in vancouver british columbia said some of the companys 
franchised travel agents would sell the cutrate tickets if 
customers insisted but would not provide refunds 
eastern wouldnt say monday whether it was considering launching 
the fares and officials declined to comment on how the airline would 
provide enough planes to meet demand if such a promotion was staged 
hundreds of passengers were stranded in new york washington and 
boston airports sunday night when eastern could not get enough 
planes in the air to accommodate the throngs that bought 12 shuttle 
tickets 
we will approach each market on an individual basis we have 
not indicated what our fare plans are said company spokesman 
robin matell in miami 
eastern would not need approval from the bankruptcy court to cut 
fares matell said

eastern airlines pilots and mechanics unions say 
they will mount a challenge in bankruptcy court to the proposed 365 
million sale of the airlines northeast shuttle to developer donald 
trump 
at attorney for strikebound eastern said the airline will ask 
us bankruptcy court judge burton lifland this week to approve the 
shuttle deal the first of an expected series of asset sales by the 
troubled airline 
farrell kupersmith a financial adviser to easterns 3600 
pilots about 95 percent of whom are honoring an 11day strike by 
the machinists union said the pilots would oppose the shuttle sale 
in court 
kupersmith a partner with the consulting firm touche ross amp co 
also said a committee representing the interests of eastern 
creditors in the proceedings would want time to review the deal 
further delaying the sale 
every creditor knows that the only consistently profitable part 
of eastern is the shuttle he said you do not reorganize 
companies by selling the best part 
a machinists official also said monday the union was working on 
its own bankruptcy reorganization plan for eastern which could 
include a buyout of the airline 
the request to sell the shuttle would be the first step in what 
is expected to be a long and bitter battle to reorganize eastern 
which filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors in us 
bankruptcy court last week 
eastern has 180 days to file a full reorganization plan which 
lawyers said would include the sale of some of easterns 45 
billion in assets in addition to the shuttle after the 180 days 
other parties in the case can file restructuring proposals 
under federal law eastern must persuade lifland that the sale of 
any asset is absolutely necessary to continue operations 
the shuttle linking new york boston and washington has been 
operating since the machinists went on strike march 4 the strike 
sparked sympathy walkouts by pilots and flight attendants that 
nearly shut the carrier down 
the airline last weekend discounted shuttle fares to 12 and 
reduced them to 49 during this week to lure passengers 
eastern lawyer bruce zirinsky said a request to close the shuttle 
deal announced in october would be made by weeks end repayment 
of associated debt and a required pension fund payment would leave 
eastern with about 210 million in cash from the sale 
if you dont sell it theres a significant risk that it will 
deteriorate in value and mr trump may walk away zirinsky said 
we dont think its prudent for eastern and its creditors to bear 
that risk 
us trustee harold jones who will supervise administration of 
easterns chapter 11 case said monday that a meeting to appoint a 
committee of about 20 creditors was set for march 22 
the machinists also will seek to block any easternproposed 
reorganization and keep the airlines assets from being sold said 
john peterpaul vice president of the international association of 
machinists 
peterpaul said the union had a framework in place for a 
reorganization that would include a joint buyout with outside 
parties but declined to elaborate trans world airlines chairman 
carl c icahn has been mentioned as a possible buyer 
union officials contend that frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp intends to strip easterns assets attempt 
to impose lower wages and break unions as part of a restructuring 
lorenzo has pledged to keep the airline aloft by preserving its core 
operations 
the shape of easterns reorganization plan largely depends on 
whether lorenzo can replace pilots and increase the number of routes 
being flown 
industry sources said eastern is expected to begin advertising 
this week for pilots because far fewer have returned to work than 
the airline had hoped 
despite reports of a pilot shortage sources said other airlines 
were hiring like crazy and that the air line pilots association 
planned to dissuade pilots from joining eastern the trump sale also 
could siphon some needed pilots from the airline 
an industry official with knowledge of alpas plans said the 
union this week is expected to approve loans strike benefits and 
payment of back salary to eastern pilots alpa also plans to seek 
commitments from other airline pilots unions not to fly planes on 
routes purchased from eastern unless the airline hires eastern 
pilots

channel one an advertisersupported tv news 
service for schools produced commercialfree live coverage of the 
space shuttle launch but one critic says the service still doesnt 
belong in the classroom 
peggy charren head of the massachusettsbased advocacy group 
action for childrens television said she expected the architects 
of channel one would be on their best behavior during the 
current fiveweek test of the service 
trojan horses have some benefits thats why people let them 
into the city in the first place she said 
if the project moves beyond the test stage and is installed in 
schools across the country mrs charren said she would not be 
surprised to see an expansion of the time allowed for commercials 
during the test in six schools paid ads are limited to no more 
than two minutes during channel ones 12minute daily news show 
the problem isnt the two minutes of ads the problem is we are 
selling children to adverstisers they think they are going to get 
enough kids buying enough products to make the investment 
worthwhile she said 
the special coverage of the shuttle discoverys launch monday was 
billed by channel ones producers whittle communications lp of 
knoxville tenn as a chance to demonstrate the vitality and 
versatility of the news service that it hopes to make available to 
8000 schools next year 
the 15minute program included live shots of the blastoff and 
commentary from exastronaut don lind and the two young news anchors 
who appear on the regular channel one show 
it was left to each of the six test schools to use the program as 
they saw fit broadcasting it live in selected classrooms or taping 
it for later use 
at mumford high school in detroit principal robin oden said he 
let teachers decide whether the show would be appropriate he said 
about threefourths of the teachers showed it live 
it was very very exciting oden said these are the kinds 
of things that we can do with this system 
stan jasinskas principal at eisenhower middle school in kansas 
city kan said he had planned to record the show for later use 
but gave teachers the option of running it live after the launch was 
delayed about two hours 
jasinskas said commercialfree specials certainly cant hurt 
whittles campaign to win support for the channel one project 
channel one is in the second week of 25show test at the six 
schools whittle communications gave each school 50000 in video 
hardware and a satellite dish the news program produced in los 
angeles is sent by satellite each morning to the test schools 
where it is recorded automatically for replay during school hours 
the daily news show has included pitches for levis jeans 
snickers candy bars wrigleys chewing gum and head amp shoulders 
shampoo 
groups such as the national parentteachers association and the 
national association of secondary school principals have opposed the 
idea of including paid ads in programs that are shown in school 
but whittle argues that the ads are a reasonable price for 
schools to pay for the hardware and programming that none of them 
have been able to afford otherwise he also says the schools are 
free to use the television equipment for other school purposes 
mumfords oden for instance said teachers at his school plan to 
make a videotape of tips on how to prepare for a required aptitude 
test he said the tape probably will be shown during the twoweek 
spring break hiatus that channel one is allowing starting next week 
whittle also has agreed with a group of western public broadcast 
stations to make the channel one distribution system available to 
carry selected public service programs that schools could tape for 
later use

the uscanada free trade agreement is going 
so well that the countries will likely accelerate tariff reductions 
top trade officials say 
us trade representative carla hills and canadian trade minister 
john crosbie said they planned to begin reviewing requests to speed 
up work toward eventual removal of tariffs on certain products 
mrs hills said that there was tremendous interest on the 
part of us firms to lower tariff barriers early the historic free 
trade agreement which took effect jan 1 calls for the gradual 
phaseout of all tariff barriers and most nontariff barriers 
between the two countries over the next 10 years 
while the trade pact spelled out the cuts to be made each year in 
tariffs on particular products it provided for an acceleration if 
both countries agreed 
crosbie predicted that faster tariff reductions could take effect 
starting next jan 1 if negotiations are successful 
mrs hills said that her office already had received 200 requests 
for accelerated tariff reductions on 2000 items 
peter murphy the senior american negotiator on the free trade 
agreement said steel textiles chemicals anything you can think 
of could be included 
mrs hills and crosbie spoke to reporters monday after the first 
meeting of the uscanada trade commission they are the only 
members of the commission which was created to resolve disputes 
arising out of implementation of the accord 
she termed the first session very very productive referring 
in particular to the progress made in setting up a review procedure 
for reductions in tariffs 
about 70 percent of the 155 billion in trade between the united 
states and canada is already dutyfree the new agreement which won 
approval in congress and the canadian parliament last year is 
expected to reduce the cost of doing business in both countries 
helping to spur productivity 
mrs hills and crosbie discussed some areas of disagreement 
between the two nations including disputes over trade in autos 
lumber fish and wine 
crosbie predicted a complaint by american lumber companies that 
canada was unfairly blocking shipments of us plywood into canada 
would likely be the first issue referred to a settlement board 
meanwhile at a congressional hearing monday experts on trade 
clashed over the question of whether the united states should have 
more free trade accords like the one with canada supporters said 
america should explore similar agreements with mexico and countries 
in the far east 
not only do free trade agreements provide tangible benefits 
they also demonstrate to a skeptical world the benefits provided 
by increased trade liberalization said doral s cooper the chief 
negotiator of a usisrael free trade agreement 
mrs cooper a former assistant us trade representative who now 
heads an international business consulting firm said several 
countries on the rim of the pacific ocean are interested in such 
agreements 
but c fred bergsten director of the private institute for 
international economics told the senate finance subcommittee on 
international trade that he opposed separate free trade pacts 
the united states cannot possibly achieve the liberalization of 
foreign trade barriers it needs from even the most extensive 
possible series of bilateral and regional deals he said

the boeing co is seeking dismissal of a suit 
filed by an employee who said he contracted potentially fatal 
leukemia from exposure to electromagnetic pulse radiation on the job 
without his knowledge 
in a motion filed late last week in king county superior court 
boeing attorneys led by vl woolston said the case brought by 
robert strom 49 of kent a 27year employee of the aerospace 
giant was ruled out by the same law that established washington 
states workers compensation system 
michael withey stroms attorney said monday the case qualified 
for an exception under the law 
there are certain wellstated exceptions to the workers 
compensation system he said theres no question in our mind 
that boeing intended to subject bob strom to this radiation without 
his knowledge 
on friday stroms attorneys moved to expand the suit to a class 
action covering about 350 employees of boeing and other companies 
who were exposed to the radiation known as emp 
given its broadest possible reading the latest boeing 
document says the suit claimed the company knowingly subjected 
strom to a dangerous form of radiation exposure deliberately 
departed from proper safety procedures and failed to warn him 
regarding risks associated with radiation exposure 
boeing flatly denies the truth of these scandalous 
allegations the document states 
withey and the boeing attorneys have asked judge mary wicks 
brucker to hear their motions april 10 
strom an electronics technician learned in june 1985 that he 
had chronic myelogenous leukemia and filed for workers compensation 
benefits the next year he said he conducted emp experiments in the 
mx missile program 
his claim was rejected by the state department of labor and 
industries which held that the fatal disease was not the result of 
exposure to the radiation the board of industrial insurance appeals 
upheld that finding twice 
last november an industrial insurance appeals judge ruled that 
evidence failed to establish that emp exposure caused the leukemia 
strom appealed that ruling to the king county superior court an 
action separate from the lawsuit and boeing attorneys argued that 
the appeal is his proper legal course of action

a decision by a japanese pharmaceutical firm 
to acquire shaklee corp for 395 million sent the giant direct 
sales companys stock soaring 
following announcement of the 28 per share allcash bid by 
yamanouchi pharmaceutical co shaklees stock jumped 9 to close at 
47 on the new york stock exchange monday 
the stock price set a 52week high for shaklee a san 
franciscobased direct seller of vitamins household and 
personalcare products 
i feel its a very fair price for shareholders said o lee 
tawes iii an analyst with new yorkbased oppenheimer amp co he said 
the combination of the bid and special dividend will work out to 
about 24 times earnings 
the bid by the japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer foiled an 
unsolicited offer from a minneapolis group headed by corporate 
raider irwin jacobs 
on monday jacobs said he will not make a new offer for shaklee 
yamanouchi which last month bought shaklees japanese 
subsidiary will pay cash for shaklees estimated 14 million 
outstanding shares and intends to retain current management 
i am very pleased that we have joined with yamanouchi in an 
historical accomplishment a major acquisition accomplished through 
the joint efforts of american management and a major japanese 
company providing substantial benefits to public shareholders 
said shaklee president david chamberlain in a statement 
chamberlain reached later by phone said the japanese firm 
bought the company because they were very excited about the 
management and liked the companys current direction 
the 28 per share bid is in addition to a special dividend 
recently announced that will provide another 20 per share to 
shaklee stockholders payable next monday 
yamanouchi which had net income of 173 million and sales of 
142 billion last year beat out a 40 per share 528 million cash 
offer by jacobs group on march 3 
however the jacobs group which included minnesota twins owner 
carl pohlad said its offer would be reduced to 20 per share if the 
20 special dividend was paid 
under the merger agreement shaklee agreed to pay 16 million to 
yamanouchi if shaklee is purchased by another company 
jacobs reached at his minneapolis office said his group had 
purchased some two million shares of shaklee stock at 2526 per 
share and stands to make up to 44 million in profit from the 
yamanouchi deal 
were disappointed we didnt get the company but id be a fool 
if i said i was disappointed financially said jacobs a 
49yearold investor who had hoped to mesh shaklee with watkins co 
a direct seller of household products he bought 10 years ago 
jacobs insisted his intention was to buy shaklee and that his 
group was merely outspent by the japanese company 
we will not be competing on it jacobs said they have a 
chance to do very well we wish them a lot of success 
the merger agreement also provides yamanouchi the option to buy 
15 percent of shaklees shares at the tender offer price under 
certain circumstances 
shaklee had earnings last year of 272 million or 205 per 
share on sales of 627 million almost half its earnings last year 
and more than a quarter of its sales came from the japanese unit it 
sold to yamanouchi for 350 million 
shaklees board of directors unanimously approved the merger 
agreement following a review and recommendation from a special 
committee comprised of independent members of shaklees board

a new york investment group has bought an 88 
percent stake in cnw corp and may attempt a takeover of the 
railroad company 
japonica partners a limited partnership formed in 1988 by two 
former executives of the new york investment firm goldman sachs amp 
co told the securities and exchange commission it wants to replace 
current cnw directors with its own slate 
paul kazarian one of the partners said monday that japonica is 
pursuing discussions with financial institutions aimed at 
financing the takeover 
cnw chairman robert schmiege said the company will carefully 
review the filing but added that the chicagobased railroad 
company intends to remain independent 
cnw is the holding company for the chicago and north western 
transportation co a leading freight hauler 
japonica told the sec in a filing that it plans to wage a proxy 
fight at cnws annual meeting may 16 in an attempt to elect its own 
slate of directors 
it said that if it is successful in obtaining an active role in 
the management andor control of the company it will consider 
several possible actions including taking cnw private 
restructuring the firm and selling certain assets 
in a letter march 13 to schmiege kazarian accused cnw of 
refusing to sponsor adequate plans or programs to substantially 
enhance stockholder value by closing the value gap between the 
companys potential value and its prerumor stock price 
schmiege saw it differently 
our board of directors and our management has made it very 
clear that the interests of all of its constituencies are best 
served by cnw remaining an independent company and pursuing its 
recently adopted business plan said schmiege 
rumors of a possible takeover have driven cnw stock sharply 
higher in recent weeks gaining almost 8 a share since march 1 
however cnw stock fell 87 cents to 3825 monday on the new york 
stock exchange after announcement of the filing 
anthony hatch an analyst with painewebber group inc in new 
york said investors may have been disappointed that the takeover 
attempt wasnt being mounted by someone with greater financial clout 
in partnership with kazarian 33 is michael g ledermann 36 an 
attorney with experience in railroad legal matters 
kazarian said he headed the team that advised santa fe southern 
pacific on its restructuring but left goldman before the effort was 
completed 
while at goldman kazarian also worked on conrails public 
offering and on the spinoff of the illinois central railroad from 
whitman corp 
in 1988 cnw posted a 195 percent increase in net income to 81 
million or 434 a share on revenues of 9954 million

005 point each to 8 and 82 percent respectively

its level of december 1988 when it stood at 75 percent

after nearly 12 hours of negotiations 
common market countries on tuesday tentatively adopted eecwide 
television broadcast rules designed to stem the flood of us shows 
and encourage european productions 
at a european economic community trade ministers meeting 
belgium denmark and west germany voted against the legislation but 
could not block it under eec voting rules 
the eec law stipulates an unspecified majority of televison 
programs excluding news and sports casts must be of european 
origin to be shown throughout the 12nation community 
this applies to both eec and noneec broadcasters the eec law 
also sets out minimum standards of morality and regulates the 
frequency and duration of commercial breaks 
jean dondelinger the eec commissioner for audiovisual affairs 
welcomed the accord we now have across the community the same 
legislation on television broadcasting he said 
his draft law included a minimum 60 percent european content 
clause 
this was rejected in talks among the eec states that revealed a 
rift between northern and southern states as to how far the 
community must discriminate in favor of european content the eecs 
southern nations favored stricter europeancontent rules in 
television 
officials said the law is designed to limit the number of 
relatively cheap american television productions from west european 
television screens and to encourage more european programming 
it is estimated that 70 percent of television programs shown in 
europe are of noneec origin the overwhelming majority of them 
american 
tuesdays agreement will be completed april 13 they said 
the eec law also aims to encourage local production of programs 
in eec nations with a weak production capacity or which have 
language restraints it also forces broadcasters to fix a minimum 10 
percent of broadcast time for european programs by independent 
producers 
belgium voted against the plan saying it lacked adequate 
protection for its dutch and frenchspeaking broadcast industries 
denmarks opposition arose from a belief the eec commission lacks 
the ability to monitor compliance with the legislation 
in voting against the legislation west germany argued the 11 
west german states not the bonn government are responsible for 
broadcasting 
also officials said bonn wanted the eec legislation to consider 
east bloc television productions as european which is not the 
case under the eec law 
the eec plan is in line with a draft broadcasting convention of 
the 22nation council of europe a cultural and political 
organization based in strasbourg france the council of europe 
which is a separate body from the eec is to finalize its convention 
later this week

in an escalaton of a legal battle that began last 
year information consulting group inc has filed a 300 million 
lawsuit claiming accounting and consulting giant arthur andersen amp 
co is out to destroy it 
in a lawsuit filed monday in cook county circuit court icg 
accused andersen of intimidating prospective icg employees and 
clients and of using its dominant market position to prevent 
competition in the consulting field violating illinois antitrust 
laws 
andersen has waged a campaign of false statements coercion 
and unfair trade practices against icg said gresham t brebach 
jr chief executive officer of new yorkbased icg a consulting 
firm formed last year by six exandersen partners 
icg is entitled to transact business without being intimidated 
or otherwise inhibited in its ability to compete brebach said

survive in a competitive field 
in addition to the 300 million damages claim icgs lawsuit 
requests an injunction barring andersen from further interfering 
with icgs recruitment and business development efforts 
the legal battle between the two firms began last year when six 
former arthur andersen employees including brebach left the agency 
to start their own competing firm with the assistance of 
londonbased saatchi amp saatchi plc 
andersen the nations largest accounting and consulting firm 
has sued saatchi and icg accusing them of trying to force andersen 
to sell at least part of its consulting business 
andersen has since restructured its operations by elevating the 
internal status of its consulting partners in an apparent attempt to 
end defections of the sort that led to the creation of icg 
icgs lawsuit claims andersen threatened partners and employees 
who were considering leaving the company for icg and offered others 
extra pay and better jobs if they would stay 
in a lawsuit filed in october in the new york supreme court

andersens confidential and proprietary technology and trade secrets 
last week andersen amended its lawsuit to include 14 additional 
defendants including maurice saatchi chairman of saatchi amp 
saatchi the worlds largest advertising holding company 
the amended complaints allege that maurice saatchi and former 
andersen personnel now with icg are participating in various 
improper activities to injure andersens consulting practice 
in a lawsuit filed in december seven former employees of 
andersen including the six at icg charged that andersen owes them 
income retirement benefits and their capital contributions to

a small toronto company says it wants to block the 
multibilliondollar takeover of texaco canada inc and make a bid 
itself for canadas fourthlargest oil company 
the president of barron hunter hargrave strategic resources ltd 
a pennystock company that trades on the alberta stock exchange 
made the statement monday after the exchange forced the company to 
clarify a news release issued last week 
texaco inc based in white plains ny announced jan 20 that 
it was selling its 78 percent stake in texaco canada to imperial oil 
ltd of canada for 324 billion imperial is 69 percent owned by 
exxon corp the largest us oil company 
while analysts dismissed the new 11thhour bid john hargrave 
said his firm has backers that will finance an offer for texaco 
canada if the federal competition tribunal blocks the megamerger 
last week the company issued a cryptic statement saying it had 
entered into an agreement with texaco inc last september 
regarding the acquisition of texaco canada 
but the alberta exchange ordered the company which has small 
mining and oil interests to issue a clarification monday 
the new release made it clear the agreement with texaco was 
only a confidentiality agreement which was signed by several 
companies that wanted to review the us oil giants information on 
its canadian subsidiary 
hargrave also said he had confidential information that 
imperial was planning to sell gas stations to petrocanada 
imperial spokesman dennis baxter said monday he hadnt heard of 
the companys involvement while a texaco spokesman said several 
companies had signed the confidentiality agreements 
news of the companys involvement was apparently leaked prior to 
last weeks statement as the share price jumped to 7 cents from 4 
cents in active trading 
on monday the share price rose another penny to 8 cents on a 
volume of 168000 shares 
but hargrave said he is not simply trying to boost the stock 
price 
if we wanted a stock play we could have done it for christmas 
but we didnt he said in a telephone interview 
if the tribunal dissolved the deal we are prepared to make a 
bid 
hargrave wouldnt reveal the names of his backers saying only 
that one was a big bank and the other a big brokerage 
imperial closed the deal earlier this month but it is awaiting 
approval from the bureau of competition policy the canadian agency 
that investigates monopolies 
the bureau has indicated that imperial must sell some of its 
assets before the deal can be approved 
hargrave said imperial oil was able to bid higher than market 
price because it is getting a near monopoly in gasoline sales in 
ontario 
he said barron hunter hargrave would intervene at the tribunal 
hearing and seek the dissolution of the deal adding that it was the 
height of arrogance for imperial to close the transaction before 
the tribunal ruled on it

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade narrowed to 1353 billion last year for the best showing 
since 1985 despite a steep deterioration in the balance on 
investment earnings the government reported today 
the commerce department said the deficit in the current account 
also known as the balance of payments shrank 121 percent from the 
record imbalance of 15396 billion set in 1987 
the current account is the most important trade statistic because 
it measures not only trade in merchandise but also transactions in 
investments and other services 
the big improvement last year came entirely from merchandise 
trade where the deficit shrank by 211 percent to 1265 billion 
this reflected a 28 percent surge in american export sales which 
was enough to offset a 9 percent rise in merchandise imports 
however in an ominous sign for the future the nations surplus 
in the investment category shrank by 76 percent last year to a 
slight 478 billion down from 1976 billion in 1987 
this decline reflected the fact that foreign holdings in the 
united states have increased to such an extent that foreign 
investment earnings now rival and economists say will soon surpass 
american investment earnings overseas 
as recently as 1981 the united states ran surpluses in its 
current account because the nations cushion in overseas investment 
earnings was enough to offset perennial deficits the country ran in 
merchandise trade 
however in this decade americans have handed over billions of 
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods this 
development has transformed the united states from the worlds 
largest creditor nation a position now held by japan to the 
worlds largest debtor country 
simply put that means that foreigners now own more in us 
investments than americans hold in overseas investments 
with todays report us net debt probably climbed above 500 
billion at the end of 1988 up from from 3682 billion at the end 
of 1987 the exact accounting of the us net debtor position will 
not be released by the commerce department for several more months 
while former president reagan maintained that the big rise in 
foreign investment was simply a sign that the united states offered 
excellent opportunities many private economists contend that 
americans standard of living will be reduced as the country is 
forced to transfer more assets abroad to service the debt to 
foreigners 
todays report showed that the current account deficit for the 
octoberdecember quarter declined by 21 percent to 319 billion 
compared with a revised 326 billion deficit in the third quarter 
the quarterly improvement came from a rebound in the services 
category to a surplus of 45 billion after two consecutive 
quarterly deficits those deficits in services which primarily 
reflect investment earnings were the first in that category in 30 
years 
but despite the rebound in the fourth quarter economists say the 
trend is clearly in the wrong direction and they predict 1989 will 
likely be the year that the services category dips into deficit for 
the foreseeable future 
that will mean that for the countrys overall balance of payments 
to improve the united states will have to start running surpluses 
in merchandise trade something it last managed to do only once in 
the last 15 years 
for the year as a whole the 1353 billion current account 
deficit was the smallest since a 1151 billion imbalance in 1985 
the current account last showed a surplus in 1981 when the country 
took in 688 billion more from foreigners than it purchased from 
them 
while merchandise trade showed a dramatic improvement in 1988 
many economists believe that improvement has now stalled out 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc said the 
united states would not see any further improvement in its trade 
performance this year in part because the value of the dollar has 
not fallen enough to spur further gains in us export sales a 
weaker dollar makes us goods more competitive on overseas markets 
we will have a lot of volatility from month to month but we 
are not looking for any improvement for the year as a whole ms 
latta said 
the countrys continuing need to finance its trade deficits with 
foreign investment is one of the biggest economic problems facing 
the new bush administration 
the dollar fell sharply immediately following bushs election as 
foreign investors feared that bushs notax pledge and the larger 
democratic majorities in congress insured further deadlock on 
resolving the federal budget deficit which must be financed in part 
with foreign borrowing 
bush moved quickly to reassure jittery financial markets by 
pledging at every opportunity that he viewed tackling the federal 
budget deficit as his top economic priority 
while the dollar did stabilize the administration remains 
concerned that foreign investors could grow disenchanted if they 
believe the current budget negotiations between the administration 
and congress are likely to end in stalemate

pilots from all the nations air carriers are 
considering ways to support fellow pilots in the strike against 
eastern airlines including refusal to fly eastern planes or routes 
sold by the airline 
the air line pilots association board met all day monday in a 
closeddoor session to plan strategy for the eastern machinists 
union walkout which is in its 11th day today 
john mazor pilots spokesman said 46 pilot union leaders from 
various airlines discussed the level of strike benefits to be paid 
3600 pilots who have been honoring the machinists walkout 
the group also is setting up interestfree loans for paychecks 
which members should have received from eastern for their last week 
of work before the strike mazor said eastern filed for protection 
under bankruptcy laws last thursday which was payday and the 
unions have appealed to the bankruptcy judge to release their pay 
the pilots discussed plans to refuse flying eastern planes or 
routes purchased by their airlines unless enough eastern pilots are 
also hired to fly them mazor said to cover all shifts that could 
include from six to 12 crew members for each plane he said 
eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1000 
daily flights and officials have said they plan to scale down the 
airline possibly selling off assets to other carriers 
a 365 million sale of the airlines northeast shuttle operations 
to new york developer donald trump was pending before the strike it 
awaits approval of the federal aviation administration which must 
determine whether trump can operate the airline safely and of the 
bankruptcy court in new york 
mazor said eastern has been able to slightly expand operations in 
recent days because it finally has been able to deploy more of its 
management pilots not because of union defections he said that 
although a few union pilots have crossed the lines more from the 
other side have joined the walkout resulting in a net loss of 
pilots available to the airline 
mazor acknowledged that a directive last week for union pilots of 
all the nations airlines to follow the most timeconsuming safe 
flying procedures did not result in significant delays at airports 
he said about 60 percent of pilots were following the procedures 
and he expected many to continue but mazor said there were no plans 
to either repeat or rescind the notice which had been intended as a 
show of support for eastern pilots 
the air transport association representing the nations major 
airlines had urged the pilots not to follow the directive which it 
characterized as a slowdown order

soybean futures prices opened slightly higher but 
wheat and corn mostly lower today on the chicago board of trade 
most of the activity was in the wheat pit where a round of 
profittaking followed several sessions of rising prices and 
lifeofcontract highs prompted by the unusually dry weather 
recently in the plains 
but the profittaking coupled with the chance for rain this 
weekend put wheat under pressure at the opening bell and traders 
warned if it continued lower a spillover effect may bring the beans 
and corn down as well 
even though youve got a bullish weather forecast the market 
takes a break once in a while to recover profits said one trader 
thats what we might be looking at today 
at the opening wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 434 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 277 oats were cent lower 
to cent higher with march at 210 a bushel and soybeans were

the air line pilots association said today its 
members would refuse to fly eastern airlines planes or routes that 
are sold to other airlines unless strikesupporting eastern pilots 
are hired with them 
the association also announced a 9million benefits package for 
eastern pilots honoring a machinists union walkout 
eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1000 
daily flights and officials have said they plan to scale down the 
airline possibly selling off such assets as planes and routes to 
other carriers 
a 365 million sale of the airlines northeast shuttle operations 
to new york developer donald trump was pending before the strike it 
awaits approval of the federal aviation administration which must 
determine whether trump can operate the airline safely and of the 
bankruptcy court in new york 
eastern filed for protection under bankruptcy laws last thursday 
which was payday and the unions have appealed to the bankruptcy 
judge to release their pay 
henry duffy pilots association president said member pilots 
from 47 airlines would be assessed an average of 300 a month to 
support the eastern pilots and the union would draw from its 
37million strike fund as the money is collected 
all 41000 pilots will reach deep into their pockets to help 
the eastern pilots who are reaching deep within themselves to cope 
with the personal and professional risks of their action duffy 
said at a news conference as the strike entered its 11th day 
he said the unions executive board also approved during a 
daylong meeting monday interestfree loans for eastern crews 
including 2000 for captains 1500 for first officers and 1200 
for second officers to replace march 15 paychecks which the company 
will not issue because it has filed for protection under bankrupty 
laws 
the pilots were also appealing to the bankruptcy court to appoint 
a trustee other than texas air corp head frank lorenzo to oversee 
eastern airlines business during bankruptcy proceedings 
john bavis chairman of the striking eastern pilot group said 
the unions monthly payments would amount to less than half of 
airline pilots regular salaries but would help them meet mortgage 
payments and buy groceries 
despite managements claim we havent cracked we havent 
given in bavis said he said less than 2 percent of easterns 
3600 union pilots had crossed picket lines he estimated that 
management was operating with fewer than 200 pilots many of whom he 
said have already worked the maximum 100 hours a month allowed by 
the federal aviation administration 
bavis said eastern pilots are continuing talks with management in 
hopes of resolving their own contract 
john mazor union spokesman said the union has given financial 
support to pilots in previous strikes but has never put together 
such an extensive package of payments loans and other action 
mazor said eastern has been able to expand operations slightly in 
recent days because it finally has been able to deploy more of its 
management pilots not because of union defections he said that 
although a few union pilots have crossed the lines more from the

profits of us banks soared to an alltime high 
of 252 billion last year even as more commercial banks failed 
than in any year since the depression the government reported today 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp said bank profits for the three months ending dec 31 hit a 
record 65 billion 600 million higher than the previous record of 
59 billion set in the third quarter of 1988 
in previewing the report in a speech on monday seidman had said 
profits were 67 billion in the fourth quarter and 253 billion 
for all of 1988 however that number did not include a single large 
bank that reported losses of 205 million for the quarter and 125 
million for the year 
the 252 billion for all of 1988 up from 28 billion in 1987 
tops the previous high of 181 billion set in 1985 
the us economy as measured by the gross national product last 
year expanded at the fastest pace in four years and the business of 
most of the nations 13114 commercial banks expanded along with it 
also third world loan problems which forced banks to take big 
losses in 1987 improved somewhat 
by far the most important factor has been the economy which 
has been strong and has been reflected in banking results inflation 
is basically under control seidman said at a news conference 
today 
however he noted that deposits grew only 4 percent in the year 
about half the rate needed to keep up with inflation and economic 
growth indicating banks were suffering competitively against mutual 
funds and other alternative investments 
commercial banks as a whole were earning the profits while a 
severe recession in oilproducing states pushed bank failures to a 
postdepression high of 221 
seidman predicted that bank failures would fall by about 20 
percent this year thirty banks have failed so far in 1989 compared 
with 44 during the same period last year 
seidman chided banks for passing on 13 billion of last years 
profits to stockholders and cautioned that the earnings figures were 
inflated by many unusual nonrecurring events 
that amount of dividends represents 52 percent of the years 
earnings a more conservative approach would have provided a greater 
capital base to improve 1989 earnings he said 
he said the nations largest banks in the fourth quarter began 
recording interest income on loans to brazil which resumed paying 
interest on its 110 billion debt 
in addition the 23 billion loss posted by first republicbank 
corp of dallas was excluded from the industrys yearend results 
because it was closed by regulators and reopened under a new owner 
those two factors alone pumped up 1988 earnings by more than 5 
billion 
the high rate of failures in 1988 caused the fdic to register a 
loss for the first time since it was established in 1934 the 
insurance fund shrank from 183 billion at the end of 1987 to near 
14 billion at the end of 1988 
president bush is proposing to replenish the fdic fund by 
increasing banks deposit insurance premium from 83 cents per 100 
of deposits to 150 
seidman said the higher insurance rate if adopted will cut into 
profits this year but industry performance will be determined 
largely by the state of inflation and the economy private 
economists expect inflation to edge up this year and they predict 
economic growth will slow in the second half 
i think its safe to say that commercial bank profits will look 
good next to thrift profits in 1989 but they will be nothing to 
brag about said paul getman an analyst with the wefa group a 
consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
the nations 2950 savings and loans likely will show record 
losses this year topping 10 billion the federal home loan bank 
board reports later this month on that industrys performance for 
1988 
the bank board this afternoon is due to report on deposit 
withdrawals in january bank board chairman m danny wall in 
congressional testimony earlier this month said a preliminary 
estimate showed net withdrawals at a nearrecord 7 billion 
he said most of that was caused by higher returns offered by 
alternate investments such as money market funds but private 
analysts blamed some of the outflow on depositor worries triggered 
by news accounts of sampl problems 
getman said steadily rising interest rates will squeeze both sampl 
and bank earnings this year but slower economic growth wont hurt 
greatly until next year most bank loans have adjustable interest 
rates and as rates rise delinquencies increase he said 
also getman said the nations biggest banks under treasury 
secretary nicholas bradys initiative announced last week will come 
under more pressure to write off third world debt in addition 
oncestellar large regional banks are having real estate problems in 
new jersey boston and atlanta he said

a federal judge today asked for clarification of 
an unprecedented settlement prosecutors say will wrest the teamsters 
union from the mafia 
under the settlement which is subject to approval by us 
district judte david n edelstein the nations biggest union will 
institute the secret ballot and three courtappointed watchdogs 
will oversee the teamsters for three years 
however edelstein recessed a morning hearing until the 
afternoon citing apparent ambiguities on matters of serious 
importance the judge asked both sides to provide this court 
with the clarification essential 
the accord was announced monday hours before the start of a trial 
on a racketeering lawsuit to oust the unions allegedly 
mobinfluenced executive board 
attorney general dick thornburgh detailed the terms of the 
agreement in washington saying it will give the government the 
tools to clean up this union and return control to rank and file 
union members 
rudolph w giuliani who filed the lawsuit in june when he was 
us attorney said the agreement achieved all the major 
objectives that the government wanted 
it should be considered a breakthrough he said 
beginning in 1991 the unions highest leaders for the first time 
in teamsters history will be elected directly by the members in 
secret ballot votes 
currently delegates to the national convention pick the 
executive board members by rollcall vote 
also under the settlement the judge will appoint three overseers 
for three years with the joint approval of both sides one would 
investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption one would 
administer disciplinary action and the third would oversee elections 
all teamsters international union officials will be directly 
elected by the membership in secret ballot thats never happened 
before said assistant us attorney randy mastro the lead 
prosecutor 
in exchange prosecutors dropped their bid to seize control of 
the 16 million member union through a courtappointed trustee the 
settlement also allows all 11 teamsters who remained as defendants 
including international president william j mccarthy plus three 
other officials who settled last week to remain on the board 
the pact between the current union leadership and the justice 
department gives neither side complete control although both sides 
tried to put the best face on the compromise agreement 
the members are assured there is a mechanism in place to remove 
those persons alleged to be conducting improper activities said 
james t grady teamsters general counsel the goals of a clean 
and democratic union are consistent with the goals of the current 
leadership 
thornburgh said the settlement culminates 30 years of efforts 
by the justice department to remove the influence of organized 
crime within the teamsters union 
using federal racketeering laws prosecutors sought a 
courtappointed trustee or committee to run the teamsters and impose 
a series of reforms it was the first time the government had tried 
to seize control of an entire union 
thornburgh said the settlement contained roughly the same kind 
of remedy that was sought in the lawsuit 
but grady noted that none of the unions ruling executive board 
members would have to resign and there will be no allpowerful 
trustee running the union on a daytoday basis 
the lawsuit claimed the teamsters leadership had been dominated 
by organized crime which deprived union members of their rights 
through a pattern of racketeering and a campaign of fear that 
included 20 murders dozens of bombings beatings bribes extortion 
and theft 
most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named defendants were 
dismissed when they either agreed or were ordered to drop any 
involvement with the teamsters five including convicted colombo 
crime family boss carmine junior persico have been severed from 
the case and will be tried later 
when he filed the lawsuit giuliani said the action was an 
attempt to break the devils pact the teamsters leadership had 
made with the mafia 
the governments move was roundly criticized by congressmen and 
labor leaders the aflcio which allowed the teamsters to rejoin in 
1987 after a 30year rift over corruption called the lawsuit a 
clear abuse of the governments prosecutorial power 
prosecutors noted in court papers that four teamsters presidents 
since the 1950s have faced federal felony charges and three were 
convicted david beck for embezzlement james jimmy hoffa for 
obstructing justice and mail fraud and roy williams for trying to 
bribe a us senator 
the fourth jackie presser the unions president at the time the 
lawsuit was brought died while under indictment on embezzlement 
charges

grocers nationwide stripped grapes and other 
fresh fruits imported from chile from store shelves today as 
authorities tried to determine the source and extent of an apparent 
cyanide poisoning attempt 
frank young commissioner of the food and drug administration 
urged americans to be safe rather than sorry and discard all 
fruit in their refrigerator unless they know for sure it isnt from 
chile 
the fda in one of the largest actions of its kind on monday 
warned consumers not to eat any fruit imported from chile after 
traces of the poison were found in seedless red grapes shipped from 
the south american country to philadelphia 
the cyanide was confirmed in testing ordered after an anonymous 
threat to poison chilean fruit was telephoned to the us embassy in 
the chilean capital of santiago 
young speaking with reporters after a white house meeting said 
that washing fruit alone would not decontaminate it if the fruit has 
been injected with the poison 
at this time you cannot tell in your refrigerator whether the 
fruit is from chile if you want to be safe rather than sorry 
discard anything that you cant tell is from chile he said 
young said he wanted to get the warning out to the american 
people because i couldnt let it on my conscience 
we have to develop an entire strategy on this he said 
well be meeting with representatives of the chilean fruit 
growers also the government of chile the fda fbi and well get a 
joint strategy we hope to do that soon 
earlier young made rounds of morning television news shows to 
spread the warning 
this may be an isolated incident but we can hardly take that 
chance he said on abcs good morning america 
he said his agency acted because we felt compelled to honestly 
warn the american people we do not know at this time how widespread 
the cyanidetainting is but we felt that it was better to be safe 
than sorry 
the chilean government and fruit packers have been incredibly 
cooperative young said we dont want to cause a public panic 
yet we only felt that it was fair that people should know 
the fda urged that all fruit imported from chile be removed from 
us markets and chilean fruit not yet distributed be held while 
tests continue 
supermarkets across the country began clearing their shelves of 
the produce soon after the announcement monday evening said karen 
brown a spokeswoman for the food marketing institute 
virtually all the fresh grapes sold in the united states at this 
time of year come from chile fda officials said adding that grapes 
make up about twothirds of the chilean fruit currently being 
shipped to the united states 
other chilean fruit being sold here at this time of year include 
peaches blueberries blackberries seedless watermelons 
cantaloupes juan canary and honeydew melons raspberries 
nectarines quince granny smith green apples cactus pears pears 
and plums 
the amount of cyanide found in the grapes was less than would be 
needed to make a small child sick but is more than would be found 
naturally the fda said canadian officials who followed the us 
lead and asked stores in canada to remove all chilean produce said 
a young child would have to eat at least 2000 grapes to ingest a 
lethal dose 
news reports in tokyo said japan also will halt imports of fruit 
from chile because of a threat of cyanide contamination telephoned 
to the japanese embassy in santiago last week 
the american produce association which represents 65 companies 
importing chilean fruits and vegetables said it also recommended 
that its members recall all chilean fruit now in food stores and 
warehouses 
neither fda officials nor the food marketing institute 
spokeswoman knew the total amount of fruit that was being taken off 
the shelves 
however chiles fruit exports have boomed in recent years the 
nations central bank says that in 1988 those exports reached 5841 
million more than 25 percent of countrys trade surplus for last 
year 
chilean interior minister carlos caceres went on national radio 
and television monday night and called the contamination an incident 
of terrorism 
he declared that chile is determined to remain a dependable 
supplier to the international fruit market and said security has 
been reinforced throughout the fruitexporting process from the 
crop to the port of destiny 
the fda began inspecting produce after the march 2 telephone 
threat four days later the fda advised that the call was almost 
certainly a hoax but as a precaution the agency said it had 
detained chilean fruit and would continue to examine samples 
a second call was received by the embassy march 8 and the fda 
said it intensified its inspections 
on sunday tests on fruit samples at the port in philadelphia 
found low levels of cyanide in two grapes and fda officials worked 
through the night testing more samples but found no other tainted 
grapes said fred shank acting deputy director of the fdas center 
for food safety 
we are confident we are out there in sufficient time to warn 
the american consumer not to eat fruit derived from chile he 
said no fruit from chile is being released for distribution in 
the food supply we are putting all the efforts that we reasonably 
can to ensure its safety 
the fda said consumers should not be worried about fruit consumed 
in the past because cyanide is fastacting 
the two grapes in which the cyanide was confirmed had been 
punctured and were discolored with a ring of crystalline material 
around the puncture area the fda said a third grape located near 
the other two was slashed but no cyanide was detected 
some cyanide occurs naturally in acidic fruit potassium or 
sodium cyanide converts to hydrogen cyanide in such produce and then 
can dissipate scientists could not determine how much of the poison 
in the contaminated fruit had been introduced and how much might 
have occurred naturally the fda said 
in the march 2 threat a spanishspeaking man claimed that fruit 
being exported from chile would be poisoned the call was 
investigated by chilean security officials and the us state 
department the fda said 
the grapes in which cyanide was found were shipped from chile 
three days before that threat the fda said

mexico has banned imports of us hogs because 
they have not been vaccinated for hog cholera a disease eradicated 
in the united states for more than a decade sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas said today 
bentsen said trucks loaded with us hogs are either on their way 
or at the usmexico border because the ban was imposed with little 
or no prior warning his office said hog trucks have been stopped at 
the border since friday but it wasnt immediately clear whether 
truckloads of hogs were waiting for entry to mexico or turning back 
to other markets 
bentsen said he had asked us trade representative carla hills 
and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to intervene and negotiate 
an end to the trade barrier 
pat elhinnaway a spokeswoman for the agriculture departments 
animal and plant health inspection service said the agency just 
received official notification from mexico about the ban we are 
in the process of translating it from spanish and analyzing it 
she said 
bentsen said hog cholera has been eradicated from the united 
states for over a decade 
in fact it is illegal under us law to vaccinate hogs against 
hog cholera and since the hogs in question are market hogs destined 
for slaughter such a vaccination would be moot in any case he 
said 
he said the mexican ban which has no basis in scientific 
fact may be based on mistaken information 
the senator said he hoped an exchange of information would 
resolve the ban but if not we should consider the remedies 
available to us under our law and the international agreements to 
which both mexico and the united states are signatories he said 
the agriculture department said mexico imported 115 million in 
live market and breeder hogs in 1988 with most of the imports 
occuring in the last seven months of the year before last june 
mexico had a prohibitive 10 percent tariff on hog imports 
bentsens office said 
in 1987 under the 10 percent tariff mexico imported only 
650000 in us hogs this years imports were expected to exceed 
115 million if they had continued at the current rate the office 
said 
it quoted figures from the national pork producers council 
showing mexico imported 95 million in live hogs from the united 
states last year excluding breeders

the ripening of the fruit 
officials with the san francisco unified school district on 
monday joined a number of smaller california school districts in 
banning apple sales in school cafeterias the los angeles unified 
school district the nations second largest prohibited lunchroom 
sales of apples a day earlier 
many of the school districts also stopped serving apple products 
including applesauce and apple juice educators said they would 
withhold sales pending tests by state health authorities 
the bans are in response to a report by the nonprofit natural 
resources defense council that states the chemical daminozide sold 
under brand names including alar could increase the rate of cancer 
in children 
the environmental protection agency is reviewing use of the 
chemical the manufacturer uniroyal chemical co of middlebury

the air line pilots association today asked a bankruptcy judge to 
appoint a trustee to run eastern airlines in place of frank lorenzo 
charging that the chairman of parent texas air corp is trying to 
strip the airlines assets 
in other developments in the 11dayold machinists strike 
alpa announced in washington today a 9 million benefits package 
for eastern pilots whose refusal to cross machinists picket lines 
brought the nations seventhlargest airline to its knees 
the pilots union said members would refuse to fly eastern planes 
or routes that are sold to other airlines unless strikesupporting 
eastern pilots are hired with them 
the 8500member machinists union late monday asked us 
bankruptcy judge burton lifland to order eastern to free strikers 
paychecks from the week before the walkout the union contends 
eastern is withholding about 9 million in pay and 1 million in 
medical claims a march 23 hearing was scheduled 
a federal judge in new york said he would issue an injunction 
barring metropolitanarea commuter railroad workers from honoring 
eastern picket lines us district judge robert p patterson jr 
who signed the order monday had issued a temporary restraining 
order march 5 against such sympathy strikes 
workers at other airlines were free to honor picket lines by 
eastern strikers as a temporary injunction expired today but a 
spokesman for the machinists union said he knew of no plans to do 
so four airlines united usair piedmont and twa had sought an 
extension of the injunction against picketing 
in new york today the pilots charged that lorenzo has stripped 
eastern of its assets to support texas air and easterns sister 
carrier continental airlines and should be barred from running 
eastern during bankruptcy proceedings 
lorenzos stripping of easterns valuable assets constitutes at 
a minimum gross mismanagement and incompetence the union said 
either a sophisticated asset stripping is under way or management 
is incompetent 
in either event entrusting texas aircontrolled management 
with reorganizing under chapter 11 would harm the estate its 
creditors preferred shareholders and employees 
texas air spokesman art kent said a trustee would be unnecessary 
because eastern already has asked the judge to appoint an examiner 
to review all transactions between eastern and the affiliated 
airlines during bankruptcy proceedings 
with that protection for debtors and creditors there doesnt 
seem to be a need for a trustee he said 
eastern meanwhile has boosted its strikedepleted daily 
schedule to more than 100 flights and imposed wage cuts more severe 
than its proposals that prompted the machinists strike 
the miamibased carrier was scheduled to unveil plans today to 
assist travelers who purchased tickets before last weeks bankruptcy 
filing the compensation may include vouchers for future eastern 
travel or tickets on other airlines eastern said 
an attorney for the airline also said eastern would seek court 
approval this week for the 365 million sale of its northeast 
shuttle to developer donald trump 
representatives of easterns pilots and machinists unions said 
they would challenge the deal a machinists official also said the 
union was working on its own bankruptcy reorganization plan which 
could include a buyout of eastern 
with service restored between miami and new york montreal and 
san juan puerto rico eastern reported 104 domestic and latin 
american flights monday 
eastern has said it hopes to build its schedule to 140 flights 
before the weekend a fraction of its prestrike level of 1040 
flights a day the airline has said about 200 of its 3600 pilots 
are crossing picket lines 
the pilots union ridiculed the companys service plans we 
believe they will be significantly hampered in ever reaching these 
stated goals because they dont have the pilots eastern pilots 
spokesman ron cole said in miami 
henry duffy pilots union president said member pilots from 47 
airlines would be assessed an average of 300 a month to support the 
eastern pilots and the union would draw from its 37 million strike 
fund as the money is collected 
all 41000 pilots will reach deep into their pockets to help 
the eastern pilots who are reaching deep within themselves to cope 
with the personal and professional risks of their action duffy 
said 
the wage cuts eastern imposed monday will reduce the wages of any 
machinists who cross picket lines and provide still lower pay to any 
workers hired to replace strikers officials said 
this package would make eastern the lowestpaid in the industry 
compared with major carriers said wally haber a general 
chairman for the machinists union i think its obvious they dont 
want anybody to come back to work 
eastern had sought 125 million in concessions from the 
machinists before the strike to stem losses the airline estimates 
have quadrupled to 4 million a day since the strike began

market investors welcomed as an inflationfighting budget plan from 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
the market had been expecting lawson to present a budget 
comprised of relatively modest tax cuts his plan was more fiscally 
cautious than economists had forecast 
dealers noted that lawson had left unchanged at 25 percent the 
standard rate of tax indicating restraint on the part of the 
chancellor from further boosting consumer spending the market had 
widely expected a drop in the rate to 24 percent 
total taxes announced by lawson will reduce revenue in fiscal 
1990 by less than 2 billion pounds the chancellor said this 
compares with expectations of a total cost of between 2 billion and 
3 billion pounds

today as investors awaited wednesdays merchandise trade deficit 
report 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 571 points at 
231196 at 2 pm est the bluechip indicator had risen 339 
points an hour after the opening bell but slid throughout the 
morning 
advancing issues barely outpaced decliners on the new york stock 
exchange with 673 issues up 657 down and 568 unchanged 
volume on the big board totaled 998 million shares 
stocks got an early boost as they tracked a rally in the bond 
market following release of february retail sales figures 
the government reported that retail sales last month declined 04 
percent from january that signaled good news for the bond market 
because it suggested an easing of consumer spending and reduced 
worries about inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome 
securities such as notes and bonds 
by midmorning the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market 
drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar and as institutional 
investors turned their attention to wednesdays government report on 
the merchandise trade deficit for january 
institutional investors are sitting on the sidelines to watch 
for tomorrows trade figures said philip puccio senior vice 
president at dillon read amp co 
volume which was light at the opening remained lackluster as 
the trading day progressed 
volume is light because of the number of economic figures due 
out this week said john burnett senior vice president of 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette the market is acting like the 
numbers are going to be good but its a skittish market 
some economists have predicted that the us trade deficit for 
january will narrow from 1023 billion in december to about 97 
billion 
but investors also are awaiting other information on the 
economys health following last fridays report showing unemployment 
fell to a 15year low in february that report sent inflationary 
shivers through the market as investors reasoned that strains on the 
capacity of the labor force might stir inflation and result in 
higher interest rates

a top european agriculture official 
tuesday rebuked the united states for pressing europeans to make 
sharp changes in their farm policies while failing to do likewise at 
home 
ray macsharry agriculture chief for the 12nation european 
economic community urged the united states to recognize in trade 
negotiations the measures adopted by the trading bloc to curb 
production and farm subsidies 
reductions were not achieved without considerable effort on our 
part and sacrifice by the farming community he said in a speech 
to the international chamber of commerce in brussels others 
should follow our lead instead of stepping in to profit from our 
efforts 
he also said we should ensure that the sacrifices of one 
negotiating party are not stripped of their value by the opportunism 
of another 
macsharry appeared to be trying to put the united states on the 
defensive in a dispute between the two sides over an american demand 
for sharp cuts in european farm subsidies the fight has stalled the 
latest round of international trade negotiations 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and us trade 
representative carla hills met over the weekend with macsharry and 
frans andriessen the eecs top trade official to try to resolve 
the issue 
the international trade talks sponsored by the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade resume april 5 in geneva 
macsharry said he told yeutter and mrs hills we must get 
credit for our reductions in support 
last year european leaders limited the maxium annual amount spent 
on price guarantees over five years us officials contend the 
measures were not enough to fix a fundamentally flawed system and 
want more longterm changes 
macsharry reiterated the eecs position that it cannot 
subscribe to revolutionary changes of its policy 
weare asked not only to freeze but also to reduce 
agricultural support he said my reaction to this is that the 
reductions we have achieved already in some of our suprlus products 
have been to put it mildly impressive 
he said quotas imposed in 1984 have cut milk production by 11 
million metric tons and meant the reduction of 36 million head of 
dairy cattle in 198688 
as a result he said the eec has contributed to stabilizing a 
sector marked by overproduction and low world prices 
it is therefore to say the least unfortunate that in 1988 
increased production in the united states canada and australia 
alone has offset reductions achieved in the community he said 
the eec provides costly subsidies to farmers through guaranteed 
prices for many crops it also gives exporters help so more 
expensive european farm prdoucts can compete with lower prices on 
the world market 
the united states complains the export subsidies have helped the 
community increase its share of the world market it has fought back 
with its own export enhancement program

depositors withdrew a record 107 billion from 
the nations savings and loan institutions in january in one month 
surpassing withdrawals for all of 1988 the government said today 
james barth chief economist of the federal home loan bank board 
said four of every five of the nations 2945 sampls had deposit 
outflows in january 
barth said a preliminary estimate shows withdrawals declining 
only slightly in february to between 8 billion and 9 billion net 
withdrawals for all of 1988 were 86 billion 
barth attributed the bulk of the withdrawals this year to the 
fact that competitors such as money market mutual funds have more 
promptly increased interest rates than thrifts have on savings 
accounts in january money market funds on average offered rates 
125 percentage points higher than sampls he said 
another portion of the withdrawals occurred as part of a 
deliberate strategy by regulators to shrink ailing institutions he 
said 
however barth acknowledged that some of the withdrawals were 
caused by confidence problems amid growing publicity about the 
condition of the industry 
president bush announced his plan for restoring sampls to health on 
feb 6 in the weeks immediately preceding that the administration 
floated a proposal since abandoned to charge bank and sampl 
depositors a fee to help rescue the sampl insurance fund 
that sort of talk undoubtedly induced some people to believe 
why keep your deposits at thrifts barth said 
february would mark the fourth consecutive month of heavy 
outflows from sampls outflows totaled 83 billion in december and 
70 billion in november from may through october outflows totaled 
94 billion 
in the first four months of 1988 there were deposit inflows of 
162 billion as investors pulled their money out of the volatile 
stock market and put it into federally insured institutions 
net deposit flows do not include interest credited to savings 
accounts including the interest sampl deposits grew 42 percent in 
1988 the slowest pace since the recession year of 1981

a member of british prime minister margaret 
thatchers government attacked part of the new us trade law on 
tuesday as protectionism masquerading as a tool to open up other 
markets 
trade secretary lord young attacked a provision known as 
super301 signed into law by former president reagan in august 
it threatens retaliation against countries which run persistent 
trade surpluses with the united states through what are judged to be 
unfair means 
i do not believe that problems in world trade can be a matter 
for forced settlements negotiated according to a timetable set by 
one partys legislature with a threat of unilateral trade action 
hanging over the other partys head young said in a speech at the 
national press club 
young said he criticized the provision in visits with us 
officials on tuesday he saw carla hills the us trade 
representative he has also seen commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
later tuesday in a speech in new york young said americans need 
not worry that they will be excluded as the european economic 
community moves toward creating a single borderless market by the 
end of 1992 
it simply is not in our own interest to adopt protectionism 
he told the united states council for international business if 
we cannot compete we will not survive 
with its emphasis on deregulation young said 1992 is in many 
ways about the thatcherization of europe 
in washington young was critical of a bill that did not become 
law which would have required registration of foreign investment in 
us firms he said it would have put extra conditions on foreign 
investment 
britain is the largest foreign investor in the united states and 
vice versa he noted

tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
volume was light and the absence of fresh news left most of the 
markets trading in narrow ranges an early bout of profittaking 
pressured wheat and it never rebounded very far despite several 
recent sessions of rising prices prompted by the unusually dry 
weather 
although the 30day forecast from the national weather service 
called for drierthannormal conditions in winter wheat regions 
some predictions of rain this weekend dampened most traders buying 
moods 
on the close wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with march at 278 oats were

the snow and ice storm earlier this month 
caused as much as 100 million in losses in three states and 
probably will force up chicken prices this year across the country 
officials said tuesday 
the storm which officials have called one of the worst blows to 
the poultry industry on record destroyed nearly 600 chicken houses 
in oklahoma arkansas and missouri said bill roenigk of the 
national broiler council in washington 
roenigk said one estimate put total damage in the three states at 
100 million 
a report from bart brorsen executive director of the oklahoma 
agriculture stabilization and conservation service said the storm 
caused 218 million in damage to equipment and buildings in the 
states poultry industry mostly in 10 eastern counties 
the report did not put a price on the 39 million chickens or 
1201 head of livestock reported lost 
gov henry bellmon has asked secretary of agriculture clayton 
yeutter to designate 16 counties as disaster areas 
roenigk in a telephone interview said the damage to poultry 
will cause the national retail price of whole broiler chickens to 
increase 2 to 4 cents a pound the average price for whole broilers 
in 1988 was 85 cents he said 
roenigk said many poultry farmers were insured for wind and fire 
damage but not snow and ice

us fruit growers and distributors tried to reassure consumers 
tuesday that their products were safe as grocers nationwide stopped 
selling chilean grapes and other produce from that country because 
of an apparent cyanide poisoning attempt 
meanwhile industry spokesmen said retailers and wholesalers 
hoped to disassociate their products from those imported from chile 
by putting up produced in the usa signs 
we want to make it clear that this chilean thing is a radical 
act that has nothing to do with growers in california and its not a 
pesticiderelated incident said marilyn watkins spokeswoman for 
sacramento califbased blue anchor inc one of the nations 
largest fruit distributors 
the food and drug administration urged tuesday that all fruit 
from chile be removed from us markets after traces of cyanide were 
found in seedless red grapes shipped to philadelphia from the south 
american country it also asked americans to discard all fruit 
unless they know it isnt from chile 
the cyanide poison was confirmed in testing ordered after an 
anonymous threat to poison chilean fruit was telephoned to th apples cactus 
pears pears 
and plums 
however industry experts say most of the winter pears on the 
stands are from the northwest 
i hope this scare doesnt affect the remainder of our 
product said maggie andre a spokeswoman for the portland 
orebased oregon washington california pear bureau 
she said all anjou pears are domestically produced while part of 
the bosc variety of pears is grown in the united states and part in 
chile none of the bartlett pears are grown domestically 
andre said retailers and wholesalers nationwide are indicating 
theyre going to put signs up on all of their produce as saying 
produced in the usa

stock prices were mostly unchanged in lackluster 
trading today after a seesaw session in which investors were 
reluctant to make commitments ahead of wednesdays merchandise trade 
deficit report 
the market opened relatively strong on the heels of a bond market 
rally following an unexpected 04 percent drop in retail sales last 
month 
the consensus was looking for flat to up 04 percent and that 
helped relieve concern that the economy is overheating said 
alfred e goldman vice president for ag edwards amp sons inc 
the report stimulated speculation that consumer spending has 
eased and that inflation is beginning to subside

drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar which suggested the 
possibility of higher inflation further credittightening by the

volume remained light with institutional investors taking to the 
sidelines to await the us merchandise trade deficit report for

wednesday 
basically after some upward stimulation and feeling that maybe 
the economy is slowing the market has gone back into hybernation to 
await the trade figures goldman said 
some economists have forecast a narrowing of the us merchandise

eastern airlines pilots asked a federal judge 
tuesday to appoint a trustee to run the carrier alleging that frank 
lorenzo chairman of parent texas air corp was stripping easterns 
assets to bolster affiliated carriers 
the air line pilots association stated in papers filed in us 
bankruptcy court that lorenzo systematically has funneled eastern 
assets to texas air and continental airlines in a plan dating to the 
1986 acquisition of eastern 
in other deveopments in easterns chapter 11 proceedings us 
bankruptcy judge burton lifland approved easterns plan to 
compensate holders of unused tickets while striking machinists asked 
the judge to order payment of 10 million in back wages and medical 
claims 
lifland set an april 7 hearing on the trustee motion 
lorenzos stripping of easterns valuable assets constitutes at 
a minimum gross mismanagement and incompetence farrell 
kupersmith a financial adviser to the pilots stated in court 
documents either a sophisticated asset stripping is under way or 
management is incompetent 
in either event entrusting texas aircontrolled management 
with reorganizing under chapter 11 would harm the estate its 
creditors preferred shareholders and employees 
losing about 4 million a day during a walkout by mechanics 
pilots and flight attendants that began march 4 eastern sought 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law 
last thursday any substantial corporate changes by eastern now are 
subject to approval by lifland 
union officials and some industry analysts have maintained that 
lorenzo plans to sell off much of easterns 45 billion in assets 
under one scenario he would cut the airline down and merge it with 
continenal 
lorenzo has said he intends to run a scaleddown eastern 
separately and denies he is stripping easterns assets to funnel 
money into texas air or continental 
but the court motion cites several examples of asset transfers 
the union says weakened eastern including 
transfer of a national computerized reservation system to texas 
air for 100 million shortly after texas air bought the ailing 
carrier the motion says eastern recently valued the system at 750 
million 
a 40 million loan to continental last spring at a time when 
eastern applied for a 105 million pension contribution waiver 
a 22 million payment to continental for strikerelated services 
in december 1987 and another 19 million payment last fall for 
similar services that have not been used 
easterns 11 million sale to continental of 11 newark 
international airport gates allegedly worth twice as much 
the pending sale of the northeast shuttle to donald trump for 
365 million which the pilots claim will result in a 30 million to 
40 million reduction in operating cash flow for eastern 
texas air spokesman art kent said a trustee would be unnecessary 
because eastern already has asked the judge to appoint an examiner 
to review all transactions between eastern and the affiliated 
airlines during bankruptcy proceedings 
with that protection for debtors and creditors there doesnt 
seem to be a need for a trustee he said 
eastern president phil bakes said eastern requested an examiner 
to dispel the misconceptions being promoted by its unions that the 
affiliated transactions are somehow not necessarily in the best 
interest of eastern 
separately lifland approved easterns plan to reimburse 
customers with unused tickets which are worth an estimated 200 
million 
under the plan passengers would receive a replacement ticket 
when eastern begins flying the canceled route plus a companion 
ticket at a 50 percent discount alternatively the airline would 
allow passengers to transfer 25 percent of the value of the old 
ticket on each of four new ones 
also tuesday lifland set a march 23 hearing on a machinists 
request to order eastern to release prestrike paychecks the motion 
says eastern is unfairly withholding about 9 million in pay and 1 
million in medical claims said robert clayman an attorney for the 
union 
the back pay covers feb 27 to march 5 clayman said paychecks 
issued last wednesday a day before eastern sought bankruptcy 
protection were not honored and no other checks were issued 
in light of the fact that active employees have been paid for 
work performed prior to the bankruptcy the iam employees should be 
treated in the same manner he said eastern received the 
benefit of that labor and now theyre not paying for it

americans import about 30 percent of the fruit 
and vegetables they consume chiefly such fresh items as grapes and 
tomatoes and the potential economic impact of the chile cyanide 
case is considerable government and trade analysts said tuesday 
they said a growing american appetite for fruit and vegetables 
has gradually boosted imports of apples grapes tomatoes and other 
items 
according to the agriculture department grape imports from chile 
grew to about 260000 tons in 1988 from 213000 in 1987 175000 in 
1986 169000 in 1985 132000 in 1984 and 108000 in 1983 just 10 
years ago in 1979 only 33000 tons of chilean grapes were 
imported the department said 
removal of chilean grapes and other fruit from american food 
stores following discovery of two grapes from chile bearing traces 
of cyanide is bound to be felt in the food industry but the extent 
of damage is hard to determine said john mcclung of the united 
fruit and vegetable association a trade group 
we dont know how long this is going to go on mcclung said 
its too soon to tell the economic impact but the potential is 
considerable both in chile and the united states 
mcclung said americans annually import about 30 percent of the 
fruit and vegetables they consume most of it in the form of fresh 
produce such as grapes apples and tomatoes 
chile is the big supplier of fruit mcclung said in 
vegetables its mainly mexico 
the agriculture department says us fresh fruit imports alone 
reached almost 362 million metric tons in 1987 up about 2 percent 
from 356 million tons in 1986 a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
bananas made up 81 percent of the 1987 fresh fruit imports 
followed by grapes with 69 percent and apples with 37 percent 
the bananas came mostly from ecuador colombia and the socalled 
caribbean basin initiative countries of honduras costa rica 
panama guatemala and the bahamas grapes mostly were from chile 
and apples from canada chile and new zealand 
a 1983 law gave 27 countries in the caribbean basin duty free 
access to us markets for 12 years 
chile has passed south africa australia and argentina to become 
the leading supplier of fresh fruit to north america and europe 
during the northern hemispheres winter months 
about 75 percent of chiles grapes are shipped to the united 
states and a large percentage of its apples go to europe but some 
apples also go to the united states where they compete with the 
domestic crop pears are another major chilean item for the us 
market according to usda analysts 
chile has a climate somewhat like ours mcclung said in an 
interview its not a tropical climate so theyre able to produce 
stone fruit like peaches nectarines plums that kind of fruit and 
those are popular in this country 
mcclung said the trade was stunned by what happened to the 
chilean grapes and was at a loss to speculate on what may happen 
next 
honestly im unaware of anything like this from any place 
ever he said but i suppose if someone is intent on a criminal 
or terrorist act regarding the tainting of produce it can probably 
be accomplished 
at the usda analyst ben w huang of the departments economic 
research service said it was too early to say what impact the 
incident may have on us food supplies 
john j vansickle of the university of florida said in a new 
report just issued by the usda agency that florida vegetable growers 
are concerned about competition from the caribbean initiative 
countries 
florida and mexico have long battled for supremacy in the 
winter fresh vegetable industry he said 
vansickle said floridas share of the winter vegetable market has 
grown only in tomatoes rising to 519 percent of us consumption 
in 198687 from 424 percent in 197576 
floridas share of the eggplant market remained fairly stable 
while the share of all other commodities fell with bell peppers 
cucumbers beans and squash each falling between 10 percent and 198 
percent he said 
even so floridas actual production of these vegetables has 
increased with the exception of beans vansickle said the decline 
in the shares of the us market shows the tremendous growth that 
has taken place in consumption

it promises to be an unusual sight 37 vintage 
ford mustangs each with a european license plate winding their way 
through the country on a 7000mile twomonth tour 
the american pony drive begins march 24 in jacksonville 
fla and ends may 9 in baltimore it is being held in conjunction 
with next months 25th anniversary of the beginning of mustang 
production 
the drive was the idea of john manners of baar switzerland who 
said ford motor co initially wasnt interested in the project 
we went ahead thinking if we could cause enough chaos ford 
would have to come in he told a news conference tuesday 
it worked 
i think we felt it was a great idea but we wondered if he 
could pull this off ford spokesman dave krupp said manners 
enthusiasm for the project persuaded ford to become part of it 
krupp said 
ford will provide eight support vehicles including a truck with 
spare mustang parts it also has notified dealers along the route to 
be on the lookout for a string of old mustangs some of which may 
need a little service during the drive 
the course will take the twodriver teams 32 from switzerland 
four from england and one from holland across the south to 
california then loop back and head north through tennessee and 
kentucky toward michigan then theyll steer east through 
pennsylvania and into maryland where the cars will be loaded onto 
ships and sent home 
manners said the cost for each team and vehicle taking part will 
be about 12000 shortterm insurance which manners said was the 
biggest problem in arranging the trip is being handled on a fleet 
basis 
two people have taken mortgages on their houses to do it he 
said 
much of any needed service on the cars will be handled by the 
teams or mustang car clubs along the route some of which also have 
planned dinners and shows to welcome the europeans 
fords first mustang rolled off the line at its dearborn assembly 
plant on april 17 1964 the car has been the only product at the 
factory since then and the plant is the only one in the nation that 
has built the mustang 
the base price for the 1964 mustang was 2368 a 1989 mustang 
carries a base price of 9450

federal regulators on tuesday formally approved 
the sale of a new type of security that allows investors to bet on 
the direction of the stock market as a whole rather than purchasing 
individual stocks 
however the decision by the securities and exchange commission 
was challenged immediately in court by the nations two largest 
futures exchanges which could lose business from the new 
competition from stock exchanges 
the futures exchanges contended that the new investment 
instrument known as a stockbasket was a thinly disguised stock 
index future stock index futures also allow investors an 
opportunity to bet on the overall direction of the stock market 
the sec voted unanimously to approve the stockbaskets proposed 
by the philadelphia stock exchange american stock exchange and the 
chicago board options exchange 
in granting the requests the sec rejected arguments that the new 
products should be regulated by the commodity futures trading 
commission and not the sec 
the sec action prompted a court challenge by the chicago 
mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade the two futures 
exchanges filed suit in a us court of appeals in chicago 
contending that the sec had exceeded its jurisdiction 
the stock baskets would be priced to reflect increases and 
declines in broad market averages such as the standard amp poors 
500stock index 
the philadelphia exchange submitted its request to trade in a 
product it designated as a cash index participation in february 
1988 similar proposals were submitted by the american stock 
exchange last april for sale of an equity index partipation the 
chicago board options exchange named its product a value index 
participation in requesting sec approval last may 
all of the index participation products would be based on the 
current value of various indexes of stocks investors would receive 
quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any 
regular cash dividend declared on the component stocks of the 
underlying index 
officials of the philadelphia and american stock exchanges had 
hoped to offer their index products beginning next month but after 
the suit was filed officials said it would be up to the court to 
decide whether to allow the products to go on sale while the legal 
issues were being resolved 
nicholas a giordano president of the philadelphia stock 
exchange said that the court suit was yet another desperate 
attempt by certain futures exchanges to avoid competition he said 
it would prevent the introduction of a product that could add 
depth liquidity and stability to the marketplace

crude oil futures prices climbed further in light 
trading tuesday amid more signs that opec members are honoring 
production quotas 
on the new york mercantile exchange the april contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil rose 26 cents 
to settle at 1929 a barrel on monday the april contract picked 
up 53 cents closing above 19 a barrel for the first time since 
jan 19 
refined products traded on the exchange also advanced tuesday 
the april contract for unleaded gasoline rose 034 cent to settle at 
5350 cents a gallon while heating oil edged up 005 cent to close 
at 5240 cents a gallon 
andrew lebow a senior broker with edampf man international 
futures inc partly attributed the gains to news that saudi arabia 
was cutting back on crude shipments to japan by 45000 barrels a day 
the report sparked buying on far east oil markets which in turn 
influenced prices in europe and new york lebow said 
traders interpreted the development as further evidence the 
saudis the largest producers in the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries were abiding by their 45 millionbarrel daily 
quota for crude output lebow said 
opec members set an overall ceiling of 185 million barrels a day 
late last year analysts have said the cartel appeared to be holding 
to its quota 
lebow said some buying tuesday came on momentum from gains a day 
earlier which were partly attributed to a fire that forced the 
closing of seven norwegian crude oil fields in the north sea 
the seven fields produce an average of 250000 barrels a day of 
crude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of gas

tuesday with prices generally edging lower as investors awaited 
release of new us trade deficit figures 
essentially it was a dead market said emmanuel geronimous 
senior vice president of shearson lehman hutton inc there were no 
major sales and no major buys 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials ended the day unchanged 
at 230625 
declining issues barely outpaced advancers in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 722 issues down 670 
up and 554 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 13997 million 
shares down from 14040 million in the previous session analysts 
attributed the light volume to a lack of participation by 
institutional investors who were awaiting a slew of economic 
reports later this week 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 16636 million shares 
the market opened higher on the heels of a bond market rally that 
followed the governments report of an unexpected 04 percent drop 
in retail sales last month 
the consensus was looking for flat to up 04 percent and that 
helped relieve concern that the economy is overheating said 
alfred e goldman vice president for ag edwards amp sons inc 
the report stimulated speculation that consumer spending has 
eased and that inflation is beginning to subside 
but by midmorning the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market 
drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar which suggested the 
possibility of higher inflation further credittightening by the 
federal reserve and higher interest rates 
after rallying briefly around midday the market drifted through 
the rest of the session on light trading volume as big institutional 
investors left the market to await the government trade report 
scheduled for wednesday in washington 
basically after some upward stimulation and feeling that maybe 
the economy is slowing the market has gone back into hibernation to 
await the trade figures goldman said 
some economists have forecast a narrowing of the us merchandise 
trade deficit in january to about 97 billion from 1023 billion 
in december 
investors also were awaiting reports later in the week on housing 
sales industrial production and wholesale prices to determine 
whether the federal reserves tight credit policy is working 
analysts said 
among blue chip issues philip morris finished down at 118 
general motors was down at 84 and union carbide finished off at 
30 
gainers included coca cola up at 50 merck up at 66 and

the chairman of the senate banking committee 
as an alternative to president bushs proposal suggested tuesday 
the government spend increments of 10 billion over the next few 
months to close insolvent savings and loan institutions 
sen don riegle dmich asked congressional auditors to work up 
numbers on the possible effects of putting the bulk of the 
100billionplus bailout of the sampl industry on the fiscal 1989 
budget instead of dragging it out over 30 years through the 
elaborate offbudget financing scheme proposed by bush 
riegle complained that the driving force behind bushs proposal 
was a desire to prevent the sampl crisis from having an impact on the 
annual deficitreduction targets in the 1985 grammrudman law which 
requires a balanced federal budget by 1993 
the bush administration already has conceded that the government 
will exceed the 136 billion target deficit for fiscal 1989 which 
ends sept 30 by 35 billion 
but the administration has been adamant in insisting that the 
fiscal 1990 target defict of 100 billion be met even if its done 
by stretching the taxpayer share of the sampl bailout costs over 30 
years at an estimated extra cost to them of 3 billion to 6 billion 
this may be another way to work with the grammrudman 
restraints and at the same time save the taxpayers an awfully lot of 
money riegle said 
it also would likely swell the projected fiscal 1989 deficit of 
170 billion which already is above the 155 billion deficit last 
year back to the 200billionplus annual deficits of the mid 
1980s as well as the total federal debt which now exceeds 26 
trillion 
riegle said his proposal being pushed in the house by a member 
of its banking committee rep charles schumer dny would 
encourage the government to liquidate more insolvent sampls 
immediately rather than attempt to keep their doors open through 
subsidized mergers 
he described it as a cleaner and in the long run less 
expensive alternative that view was expressed last week by william 
s niskanean a former economic adviser to thenpresident reagan 
then we wouldnt be forced to make these mergers which are 
very expensive riegle said 
that view was bolstered tuesday by the congressional general 
accounting office which said it would have been cheaper in a third 
of the governments 1988 spree of sampl sales to have shut the 
institutions and pay off depositors rather than sell the thrifts to 
new owners 
last year government regulators spent about 37 billion closing 
selling or shoring up 222 insolvent thrifts 284 billion of it on 
subisidies to the new owners of 179 of the them 
comptroller general and gao chief charles a bowsher told the 
senate banking committee that the the cash cost of those deals 
including some 7 billion to 8 billion in tax breaks will total at 
least 62 billion over the next few years and could go higher if 
their condition worsens 
most of these assistance contracts are for up to 10 years 
he said thats what worries everyone 
in nine of 12 governmentsubsidized mergers that the gao examined 
in detail the new owners will be able to use the guarantees against 
losses and tax breaks to recoup the money they invested in an 
average of three years bowsher said 
while generally endorsing bushs sampl plan bowsher said it 
represents the first time that the government would be making and 
openended commitment of funds with no cap on what eventually 
might have to be spent some experts have put that amount in excess 
of 200 billion over the next 10 years 
republicans defended the handling of last years sampl sales by the 
federal home loan bank board and its chairman m danny wall who 
would retain his post in the bush plan

a group of american continental corp executives 
including a former congressman from california has offered to buy 
lincoln savings and loan association one of the nations largest 
thrifts 
lincoln a 29branch irvine califbased thrift which lost 
about 36 million in the first nine months of 1988 is the principal 
subsidiary of american continental 
under two purchase plans the phoenix developer would sell 
lincoln but buy back a resort and a hotel here plus lincolns 20 
percent interest in general oriental investments ltd a 
londonbased holding company 
former rep john rousselot rcalif hired last summer to find a 
buyer for lincoln and three other american continental executives 
form the new group of wouldbe investors 
rousselot said he met monday with the federal home loan bank 
board in washington to discuss the offer of about 289 million made 
friday 
the rousselot groups offer is the third made for the 6 billion 
thrift in a year leading to industry speculation that american 
continental was trying to buy time with federal regulators critical 
of lincolns risky investments in highyield bonds and undeveloped 
property 
if you can say to the regulators were doing something or 
trying to sell the institution that gives you a reason to stall 
all regulatory action said bert ely a thrift analyst in 
alexandria va 
rousselot denied the allegation saying charles keating american 
continentals chairman is ready to sell 
he wants out of the savings and loan business like today if we 
could arrange it rousselot said 
he said his groups offer was definitive and could close by the 
end of the month 
other partners are american continental lawyers ronald stoll and 
david thompson and jack atchison former partner in an accounting 
firm who joined the company last spring as a vice president

holly farms corp will hold a shareholders 
meeting april 14 to consider conagra incs offer to buy the rival 
poultry processor in a 1 billion stock swap 
approval of the conagra bid would block attempts by another 
poultry company tyson foods inc of springdale ark to take over 
holly farms for 11 billion tyson has offered holly farms 
shareholders 60 a share in cash and pledged to pay 6350 a share 
if holly farms management cooperates with a buyout 
holly farms set its shareholders meeting for 10 am cst at the 
marriott hotel here 
however tyson has asked a state court in delaware where holly 
farms is incorporated to bar the meeting tyson also asked the 
court to nullify the conagraholly farms deal or to hold a hearing 
on the appropriateness of the proposal which provides for conagra 
to buy certain holly farms assets even if their merger falls through 
jim blair a lawyer for tyson declined comment tuesday on holly 
farms announcement 
tyson has been trying since last october to buy holly farms 
doing so would allow tyson to maintain its standing as the largest 
poultry processor in the country 
the proposed conagraholly farms merger calls of a swap of 1875 
to 2 shares of conagra stock for each of holly farms 181 million 
outstanding shares 
based on expected market prices the conagra bid amounts to about 
59 a share for holly farms stock said napoleon overton an analyst 
with morgan keegan amp co of memphis 
its still my opinion that tyson will probably end up with 
holly farms because they have an allcash offer and theyre willing 
to pay more than conagra has so far offered overton said 
throughout tysons takeover attempt conagra has declined to 
discuss any increase in its bid but overton said an increase still 
is possible 
if they go to court and the judge determines that holly farms 
is not bound by the terms of that merger agreement and the 
assetoption lockup is invalid then and only then would conagra 
have any incentive to raise its current bid he said

energy futures gained for the second straight session tuesday 
after reports that one major oil producer saudi arabia cut 
supplies to the japanese by 30 percent and another qatar had 
halted production of 150000 barrels a day while performing 
maintenance on its facilities 
on other markets silver rose strongly cocoa prices climbed amid 
concerns a labor stoppage in brazil could affect supplies and grain 
and soybean prices were mixed 
crude oil futures settled 14 cents lower to 26 cents higher on 
the new york mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in 
april at 1929 heationg oil was 01 cent to 34 cent higher with 
april at 5240 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 10 cent to 
63 cent higher with april at 5350 cents a gallon 
the 26cent climb in the spot month followed a 53cent jump 
monday that left crude oil prices at a 16month high 
the market was up on a confluence of factors said nauman 
barakat vice president for energy investments at prudentialbache 
securities inc new york but very important was the saudis 
cutting back the japanese 
the 30 percent was significantly larger than the japanese 
anticipated and about twice the cuts they absorbed in the first 
quarter he added 
barakat and other analysts pointed to indications that worldwide 
supplies were tightening confirmation monday that nonopec 
producers would go ahead with unilateral cuts of almost 300000 
barrels a day better compliance with assigned quotas some opec 
producers notably the saudis and a temporary shutdown of some 
facilities in qatar 
additionally a weekly estimate by the american petroleum 
institute issued after the close of business tuesday showed a 
reduction in stocks from the previous weeks 
weve got both fundamental and technical support for an 
uptrend said barakat 
some traders viewed the rise in oil prices as another piece in 
the inflationary puzzle and the precious metals benefited from that 
support as well as concerns that recent political rumblings in south 
africa may eventually affect supplies of platinum 
platinum climbed 690 to 710 on the new york mercantile 
exchange with march at 54930 a troy ounce gold was 150 to 
190 higher at the comex with march at 39620 a troy ounce and 
silver was 95 cents to 124 cents higher with march at 6176 a 
troy ounce 
silvers made the best bounce off the recent lows but its 
still quite cheap relative to the other metals and its drawing most 
of the speculative interest said steve chronowitz director of 
futures research for smith barney harris upham amp co new york 
but another analyst called the trend worrisome 
if silver is taking the lead we could see trouble because 
there are already considerable supplies said rich levine a 
precious metals analyst at elders futures inc new york gold and 
platinum already seem to be losing energy at these prices and if 
silver breaks and my hunch is it will it could mean weve seen a 
top for gold and platinum as well 
cocoa prices rallied sharply as a widespread strike by brazils 
labor unions affected shipments out of south america as well as 
news that sometimesquarrelsome cocoa producers were making progress 
in talks aimed at establishing supply levels 
volume was on light on the chicago board of trade and the absence 
of fresh news left the grain and soybean markets trading in very 
narrow ranges 
an early bout of profittaking pressured wheat at the opening 
bell and it never recovered despite several recent sessions of 
rising prices prompted by the unusually dry weather recently in the 
plains 
wheat was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 1 
cents higher with march at 278 oats were cent lower to cent 
higher with march at 209 a bushel and soybeans were 1 cent 
lower to 1 cents higher with march at 769 
livestock futures were mostly lower and prok future mixed at the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 25 cent to 70 cent lower with april at 7742 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 17 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with march at 8115 cents a pound hogs were 12 cent lower to 13 
cent higher with april at 4375 cents a pound and frozen pork 
bellies were 20 cent lower to 22 cent higher with march at 3825

the deficit in the broadest measure of american 
trade improved dramatically last year narrowing to 1353 billion 
as a surge in merchandise exports was enough to offset a sharp 
worsening in the us investment balance sheet the government said 
tuesday 
the commerce department said that the deficit in the current 
account shrank 121 percent in 1988 after hitting an alltime high 
of 15396 billion in 1987 
the current account also known as the balance of payments is 
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only 
trade in merchandise but also transactions in investments and other 
services 
for 1988 the improvement came entirely from a 211 percent 
decline in the merchandise trade deficit which fell to 1265 
billion as a 28 percent jump in us exports sales outpaced a 9 
percent rise in merchandise imports 
but in what many private economists called an ominous 
development the nations surplus in the investment category shrank 
by 76 percent last year to a tiny 478 billion down from 1976 
billion in 1987 
analysts said this reflected the growing ownership by foreigners 
of us government and corporate securities bank deposits 
factories and land as these holdings increase the amount of money 
foreigners earn on their us investments grows as well 
interest on our foreign debt is rising dramatically and the 
burden of financing this debt is increasing said lawrence 
chimerine president of the wefa group a private forecasting firm 
in bala cynwyd pa 
as recently as 1981 the united states ran surpluses in its 
current account as the nations cushion in overseas investment 
earnings was enough to offset merchandise trade deficits 
but in 1985 the united states became a net debtor for the first 
time in 71 years as the value of american investments overseas were 
surpassed by the value of foreign holdings in the united states 
the latest current account report showed the united states 
increased its hold on the title as the worlds largest debtor nation 
with the imbalance between us holdings and foreign holdings in 
america probably topping 500 billion up from 368 billion at the 
end of 1987 the government will not make its official accounting of 
the us net debtor position until june 
the bush administration like the reagan administration has 
maintained that the rise in foreign investment has been beneficial 
to america providing the country with needed capital to build new 
factories and increase productivity 
however many private economists worry that the growing foreign 
debt load will eventually lower americas standard of living as more 
and more us wealth is transferred into the hands of foreigners 
we are continuing to borrow money from foreigners and we have 
to pay them for that privilege said bruce steinberg senior 
economist at merrill lynch of new york 
the new report showed that the current account deficit for the 
octoberdecember quarter declined by 21 percent to 319 billion 
compared with a revised 326 billion deficit in the third quarter 
while it was the third consecutive quarterly decline analysts 
said they believed improvements in the us trade deficit had 
essentially stalled out with the deficit still at a very high level 
many predicted the deficit for 1989 would show little if any 
improvement as americans continue to buy imports at record rates 
the commerce department will provide the first look at 1989 trade on 
wednesday when it releases its monthly merchandise trade report for 
january 
the bush administration has been taking a gettough stance 
hoping to pry open more foreign markets to us goods commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher told a congressional hearing on tuesday 
that the administration wants to get the trade deficit below a 100 
billion annual rate in the next two years 
for the year as a whole the 1353 billion current account 
deficit was the smallest since a 1151 billion imbalance in 1985 
the current account last showed a surplus in 1981 when the country 
took in 688 billion more from foreigners than it purchased from 
them 
in addition to the 1265 billion deficit in merchandise trade 
and the 478 billion surplus in the services category the 1353 
billion current account deficit also reflected payments of 1358 
billion in foreign aid and pensions to americans living overseas

the air line pilots association easing the way 
for 3600 pilots honoring machinist union picket lines at eastern 
airlines said tuesday it will give its members nearly 9 million a 
month in strike benefits 
the pilots union also said its 41000 members would not fly 
planes or routes sold to other airlines by eastern which declared 
bankruptcy last week unless a comparable number of eastern pilots 
were also hired and at full seniority an industry group said such 
an action would be illegal 
john bavis head of the eastern pilots group said the strike 
benefit 2400 a month was designed to remove the companys 
last enticement to pilots who have refused to work until the 
machinists settle only 2 percent of unionized eastern pilots have 
crossed picket lines he said 
despite managements claim we havent cracked we havent 
given in he said estimating that the company was operating with 
fewer than 200 pilots many of whom he said have already worked the 
maximum 100 hours a month allowed by the federal aviation 
administration 
this is a critical time for all airline pilots said henry 
duffy the president of the pilots union all 41000 pilots will 
reach deep into their pockets kicking in an average of 300 a 
month to help the eastern pilots who are reaching deep within 
themselves to cope with the personal and professional risks of their 
action 
duffy said the union would also draw on its 37 million strike 
fund to begin paying the strike benefit which will give members 
less than half their regular salaries 
the pilots will also get interestfree loans of up to 2000 to 
cover paychecks for work performed before the strike but which 
eastern refused to issue after filing for bankruptcy 
john mazor a union spokesman said the union has given financial 
support to pilots in previous walkouts but has never put together 
such an extensive package of payments loans and other action 
late next week if the strike that began march 4 is still on the 
8500 striking machinists will get upwards of 100 in benefits from 
their union the international association of machinists said union 
spokesman bob kalaski 
the pilots union in a meeting monday of members representing 47 
airlines unanimously agreed to refuse to fly eastern routes or 
planes that might be sold to other airlines unless eastern pilots 
were hired to go along with the assets 
duffy said the pilots agreed to make their position known to 
airlines that might negotiate with eastern to buy its assets the 
union accuses frank lorenzo head of texas air corp which owns 
eastern of planning to dismantle eastern and cash in on its assets 
mazor said a refusal by pilots to fly planes or routes purchased 
from eastern would not violate the union contracts with the carriers 
but the air transport association which represents airlines 
said such a refusal would be an illegal contained strike under 
the railway labor act which governs airline disputes spokeswoman 
leslie rowland said if pilots object to flying planes from eastern 
they should file a grievance and continue to work until it is 
settled 
eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1000 
daily flights officials have said they plan to scale down the 
airline possibly selling off such assets as planes and routes to 
other carriers 
a 365 million sale of the airlines profitable northeast shuttle 
operations to new york developer donald trump is awaiting approval 
from the faa and the federal bankruptcy court in new york the 
transportation department gave its approval earlier 
an 85 million sale of eight eastern airport gates at 
philadelphia and two philadelphiacanada routes to usair is also 
pending usair spokesman david shipley said he would not speculate 
on what effect the pilots position might have on the sale which 
also would not take effect until several levels of government 
approval are secured including that of the bankruptcy court 
mazor acknowledged that a union directive last week to all 
airlines member pilots telling them to follow the most 
timeconsuming safeflying procedures did not result in significant 
airport delays 
he said about 60 percent of pilots were following the procedures 
the air transport association had urged the pilots not to follow 
the directive which it characterized as a slowdown order

percent in early march from the same period last year as usbased 
automakers continued their slow 1989 sales start the companies said 
tuesday

31090 during the march 110 period this year compared with a daily

the big three reported declines in domestic car sales rates with 
chrysler corp sales dropping 359 percent ford motor co falling 
214 percent and general motors corp declining 134 percent 
analysts speculated that sales were dampened by comparison with 
strong results in the yearearlier period and by rising interest 
rates that may finally be slowing consumer spending 
that has to cut into the familys disposable income and maybe 
theyre thinking maybe let the old buggy do longer said analyst 
mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc of new york 
interest rates have been rising in recent months partly because 
of a credit squeeze engineered by the federal reserve to slow 
economic activity and thus curb inflation the prime lending rate 
the bank lending rate used as a benchmark for many types of consumer 
loans is 115 percent compared with 85 percent a year earlier 
analysts said automakers were waiting for traditionally good 
early spring buying to start march and april sales traditionally 
have reduced automakers inventories which are hovering around the 
80day level 
according to wards automotive reports the combined inventory 
among the usbased automakers is at its highest level in 19 months 
each of the big three recently boosted incentive offers in an 
effort to stimulate sales and gm temporarily has halted production 
at two plants to reduce inventory

at the higher seniority levels us airline 
pilots earn salaries that make them an elite among unionized 
employees 
the nations 60000 or so commercial pilots earn an average of 
82500 a year plus benefits and have starting salaries averaging 
around 21600 according to future aviation professionals of 
america in atlanta 
salaries are determined mainly by seniority and the size of 
aircraft flown pilots typically start out as flight engineers 
regulating fuel levels and performing other functions in the cockpit 
but not actually flying planes they progress to become copilots of 
smaller aircraft then copilots of bigger planes followed by 
captains of smaller planes and finally captains of larger craft 
under this system widely used smaller aircraft include boeing 
727s and 737s as well as dc9s and md80s made by mcdonnell douglas 
corp bigger commercial planes include boeing 747s and 767s 
mcdonnell douglas dc10s and lockheed corps l1011tristar 
senior captains earn an average 133000 a year with the maximum 
pay for that category reaching 167000 plus substantial benefits 
according to fapa an aviation career information service 
the 10000 to 12000 pilots who fly corporate jets by contrast 
start at around 24000 and earn an average 44000 a year 
many pilots still get their training in the military but others 
attend special flight schools or professional schools 
piloting remains a predominantly white male profession only 
about 1 percent of us airline pilots are women while fewer than 1 
percent are minorities 
the average age of us pilots is in the range of 33 to 36 years 
and average seniority is 15 years of service according to future 
aviation professionals of america

the government tightened security on the 
handling of fruit exports tuesday and began a criminal investigation 
into the cyanidetainting of grapes exported to the united states 
in a nationally broadcast address interior minister carlos 
caceres vowed that chile would remain a dependable fruit supplier 
to the world 
he called the contamination a case of communist sabotage 
communist party spokesmen denied any involvement 
the agriculture minister jaime de la sotta said he would fly to 
washington to discuss the situation with us officials 
de la sotta said investigators had identified the packing house 
and vineyard that was the source of the tainted grapes he refused 
to identify them 
but the president of the exporters enrique bruzzone said the 
tainted grapes came from a vineyard and packing house owned by julia 
saavedra in the curacavi area just northwest of santiago he said 
ms saavedra is an established grower and exporter 
bruzzone said members of the exporters association voluntarily 
suspended all packing and shipping operations for 72 hours tuesdat
