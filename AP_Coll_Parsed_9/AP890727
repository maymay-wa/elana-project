a korean dc10 crashed short of the 
fogbound tripoli airport thursday and flaming wreckage cartwheeled 
through an olive grove officials said at least 75 people were 
killed including four on the ground 
there is no exact number of dead because the bodies became 
charcoal the first secretary of the south korean embassy in the 
libyan capital who identified himself only as mr chun said by 
telephone about 10 hours after the morning crash 
the pilot one of the 121 people who survived told officials he 
may have been wrong to attempt a landing in the fog according to 
the head of the libyan committee investigating the accident 
it was the second crash of a dc10 in eight days one operated 
by united air lines went down july 19 in sioux city iowa killing 
111 people 
the korean air dc10 with 199 people aboard hit cars and two 
houses and split into three pieces before coming to rest about a 
halfmile from the airport the official libyan news agency jana 
reported it said more than 110 people were hospitalized 
television reports from the site 35 miles south of tripoli 
showed rescue workers carrying bodies covered with white sheets and 
firemen hosing down the smoldering wreckage 
reporters flying into tripoli saw the huge tail section in the 
widely scattered debris 
korean officials said most passengers on flight 803 which 
originated in seoul were south koreans returning from vacation to 
their jobs on engineering and construction projects in libya 
chun said he had just returned from the crash site and there 
are about 78 dead from the plane 
but an airline official in seoul speaking on condition of 
anonymity said early friday that 128 of the people aboard the jet 
were known survivors and that 71 were unaccounted for and presumed 
dead or missing 
chun said libyan officials reported four more people were killed 
when the dc10s landing gear struck two houses near the airport 
which is surrounded by orange and olive groves farmhouses and 
grazing sheep 
chun said the planes 18 crew members survived and that four 
were slightly injured 
he said the crash happened at 705 am 105 am edt there 
was very heavy fog and many clouds we dont know if the pilot made 
an error or if the tower made an error there was no mechanical 
problem no bomb explosion the captain is conscious he thinks he 
did not do anything wrong 
some passengers quoted the pilot as saying they would land in a 
few minutes chun said then they looked out the window and 
suddenly they see olive trees and hear the landing gear hitting 
the roofs of two houses and 10 seconds later it crashed and they 
split into three parts 
chun said all the passengers in the firstclass section survived 
he said all those aboard were south korean except for three 
japanese and seven arabs 
survivor kwon hyukhwi told the munhwa broadcasting corp he was 
reading a book in the firstclass section when an announcement was 
made that the plane was about to land 
instantly there was a crushing impact and then came shrieks by 
horrified people i kept my body as low as possible and lost 
consciousness he said 
the plane cartwheeled for about 400 yards before breaking into 
pieces another south korean diplomat in tripoli chang kyungsoo 
told korean tv 
wreckage was strewn 500 to 700 yards along the ground and 
authorities closed off the area 
the airline earlier quoted the planes pilot kim hojung 54 
as saying the airport was shrouded in a dense fog and visibility 
was poor when i approached i lost contact with the control tower 
for 15 minutes before the crash 
mustapha maghrebi head of the investigating committee said it 
was not known whether pilot error or mechanical failure caused the 
crash 
he said the pilot told authorities he probably was wrong to try 
to land with poor visibility 
yonhap the south korean news agency quoted an unidentified 
korean air spokesman as saying the plane was ordered to make a 
270degree turn by the control tower and crashed at the moment of 
turning when it hit an unidentified object 
yonhap said one airline official said the crew told authorities 
the landing guidance system may have been out of order it said 
korean air had ruled out pilot error 
jana in rome said the airport control tower had told the pilot 
that there was heavy fog and only 800foot visibility it said a 
soviet aeroflot jetliner informed of similar conditions about an 
hour earlier went instead to malta 
flight 803 had made stops in bangkok thailand and jiddah 
saudi arabia en route to tripoli the airline said 
the airline official in seoul said 40 of those injured suffered 
minor burns and were expected to be released from tripoli hospitals 
friday 
he said a boeing 747sp carrying a 14member medical team and 
korean air chairman cho choonghoon departed seoul friday for 
tripoli and would return with survivors 
on july 19 a united dc10 crashed in sioux city after the tail 
engine blew apart and disabled the jets hydraulic system needed to 
steer the plane 
in long beach calif mcdonnell douglas said it was unable to 
provide information about the plane that crashed in libya because 
it did not have the aircrafts registration number 
company spokesman don hanson said mcdonnell douglas was seeking 
us government approval to travel to libya since the united states 
does not have diplomatic ties with the nation 
korean air said the dc10 was purchased in january 1977 the 
plane was built in 1973 and had logged 49025 flying hours airline 
officials said the plane received routine safety checks and had no 
problems 
korean air is a privately owned national flag carrier and the 
largest of two korean airlines it was formerly known as korean air 
lines

felix bloch the us diplomat suspected of spying for the 
soviet union told fbi agents he had been paid a lot of money 
by the soviet intelligence service during a relationship of many 
years the new york times said in friday editions 
this new development in the bloch case came after officials 
disclosed in washington that bloch got recent merit raises totaling 
more than 13000 for work well above average 
blochs reported admissions came in his one brief interview with 
the fbi on june 22 the newspaper said citing an official 
involved in the case as its source 
informed of this report three administration sources familiar 
with the bloch case said in washington thursday night they had not 
been informed of such admissions 
but the associated press learned from a congressional source 
that the fbi believes bloch was recruited by the kgb the soviet 
intelligence service combining the functions of the fbi and the 
cia during service at the us embassy in east berlin 14 years ago 
block reportedly refused to discuss with the fbi any possible 
spying activities or his motives 
the newspaper said the fbi received information that prompted 
major interest in a trip the diplomat was making to europe the 
agency notified foreign intelligence services and congressional 
committees and somehow the information got out leading to the 
previously reported overhearing of a soviet agent telling bloch 
a bad virus is going around and we believe you are now infected 
bloch got a raise of 4500 for fiscal year 198384 4000 for 
198485 and 4800 for 198586 said a us official who spoke only 
on condition of anonymity 
the pay increases were given to bloch while he served as the 
deputy chief of mission at the us embassy in vienna where he was 
posted from 1980 to 1987 recommendations for the merit awards were 
made by among others the us ambassador to austria who has been 
publicly critical of blochs performance said the official 
the ambassador to which the official referred was helene von 
damm 
the state department calls such raises performance pay awards 
granted only to those whose work is deemed well above average 
said another official who also insisted on anonymity 
government sources have said bloch was videotaped in paris 
handing a briefcase to a soviet agent he has not been charged with 
a crime but his diplomatic passport and state department 
credentials have been revoked 
agents are engaged in what is expected to be a lengthy and 
possibly futile search for the specific evidence required to 
charge bloch under the espionage act including what secrets if 
any were compromised government sources have thus far been 
unwilling to say when they believe bloch began spying for the 
soviets 
in other developments 
president bush added his voice to those advocating improved 
us counterintelligence efforts since disclosure that diplomat 
felix s bloch is under investigation as a possible soviet spy 
government sources familiar with the case said that the 
54yearold state department official could remain free for a long 
time while fbi agents try to identify specific secrets if any 
that he may have turned over to the soviets 
bloch ended a threenight stay at his fathers east side coop 
in new york city trailed by fbi agents and reporters he drove to 
his daughters house in chappaqua ny north of the city 
the ambassador during most of blochs tenure in vienna was 
helene von damm who was a senior white house secretary to former 
president reagan before being appointed to the vienna post 
von damm who left during a social flap involving her marriage 
to an austrian was replaced by ronald lauder now a republican 
candidate for the mayors job in new york city 
lauder has said he did not like or trust bloch and asked for 
him to be recalled but state department officials have said it was 
time for bloch to come home anyway after seven years in vienna 
merit raises in the senior foreign service are sometimes given 
to diplomats who are eligible for more senior postings but cannot 
get them because of a shortage of vacant slots 
raises in the senior foreign service can go as high as 9000 a 
year one official said 
bloch was put on paid leave by the state department june 22 and 
is under no travel restrictions he makes about 80000 a year 
according to officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
bush at a photo session in the oval office told reporters 
the question is can we improve our counterintelligence we 
always ought to be striving to do that can embassy security be 
improved we go through this periodically and the answer is im 
sure it can 
in vienna fridays editions of the neue kronen zeitung said an 
fbi team had arrived to assist in the investigation there fbi 
spokesmen in washington would not confirm that but viennese 
officials had said earlier in the week they were searching for a 
prostitute who they said had a relationship with bloch while he was 
the no 2 officer in the us embassy there 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
the soviet union has no connection with bloch gerasimov said he 
made inquiries about blochs activities the name of bloch was 
not familiar we have no connection with him we have nothing to do 
with him he told a regular news briefing it is lamentable 
that the us press fans such hysteria 
us government sources have said soviet officials in the united 
states who must use autos with license plates coded by country 
took the unusual step of watching blochs apartment and following 
him and the fbi in an auto caravan from washington to new york on 
saturday 
retired deputy fbi counterintelligence chief james nolan said 
ive never heard of that before in 20 years normally they stay 
as far away from these cases as possible 
the american civil liberties union on thursday condemned 
government officials who have made statements publicly and off the 
record suggesting that felix s bloch is guilty of a crime even 
though he has not been indicted us law entitles bloch to a 
presumption of innocence the group said

chinas supression of the prodemocracy 
uprising has diminished chances of a tibetan independence tibetan 
exiles say and some believe it may be time to bring new militancy 
to the movement 
what happened in china will not help the tibetan struggle in 
any way said lhasang tsering the chief of the tibetan youth 
congress one of the most radical exile groups now freedom will 
not come but it must be earned 
the youth congress is based in dharmsala an exile colony of 
tibetan refugees in the foothills of the himalayas in northern 
india 
the first of dharmsalas 7000 inhabitants fled their homeland 
along with their spiritual and temporal leader the dalai lama to 
escape the chinese occupation army in 1959 
for 30 years we have been speaking of chinese atrocities if 
china is capable of killing their own people surely they will not 
hesitate to show any mercy on the tibetans said sonam topgyal of 
the tibetan information office of the governmentinexile in 
dharmsala 
hundreds perhaps thousands of unarmed civilians were killed 
june 34 when troops used guns and tanks to clear central beijing 
of prodemocracy protesters 
we lost an opportunity to win independence said rinzen 
dolkar a middleaged housewife who runs a small cafe referring to 
the crackdown 
in the past the chinese military and police have often crushed 
proindependence demonstrations in tibet and exiles say 800 people 
died during the latest chinese crackdown in the capital of lhasa on 
march 5 
chinese authorities put the toll at 16 
the independence movement however has been largely peaceful 
because the revered dalai lama advocates nonviolence and 
negotiations to free his homeland a remote mountainous region on 
chinas southern border 
the 6 million tibetans worldwide consider the dalai lama to be 
the living buddha the founder of the religion 
china claims tibet has been an integral part of chinese 
territory for seven centuries but tibetans maintain it was an 
independent nation before the communists moved into tibet in 1950 
china will not loosen its grip over tibet because of its 
military importance also china desperately needs land for its 
bursting population said jampa dharton the top religious 
adviser to the governmentinexile 
china has not responded to the dalai lamas longstanding offers 
that included his biggest compromise allowing china to handle 
tibets foreign and defense affairs in return for independence 
but a senior official of the tibetan governmentinexile 
speaking on condition of anonymity said i have my doubts about 
nonviolent methods with the chinese 
dawa norbu an international relations expert at new delhis 
jawaharlal nehru university said the dalai lama should now ask 
tibetans in lhasa to stage more protests so the chinese will have 
no option but to hold talks 
the most vocal opponent of the dalai lamas stand is the tibetan 
youth congress led by the 35yearold tsering a former guerrilla 
who claims to have 10000 followers mostly in india 
tsering says the chinese authorities are insincere and cannot be 
trusted to negotiate for an independence tibetans must put an 
end to these misplaced hopes and faith he said in a recent 
interview 
all my life i have been trying to learn and speak english but 
i have been learning the wrong language theres only one language 
the world understands and listens to and that language is violence 
we have to learn to speak that language

a canadian patrol boat chased a new bedford 
fishing boat into american waters wednesday after allegedly 
spotting the scalloper filling its nets in canadian waters the 
us coast guard said 
canadian officials allege that as the us boat the bountiful 
entered us waters just before 4 pm it turned and rammed the 
patrol boat cygnus coast guard chief petty officer jack mason said 
no one was injured and neither boat was seriously damaged he 
said 
the bountiful was allegedly seven nautical miles into canadian 
fishing waters and 165 miles east of nantucket when it was spotted 
by the cygnus at 230 pm coast guard spokesmen said 
the cygnus asked canadian authorities for permission to fire 
warning shots across the bountifuls bow to force the american 
skipper to halt but as of 1030 pm permission to fire was being 
withheld mason said 
the coast guard has radioed the bountiful to recommend that it 
stop for its own safety but it planned not to interfere unless the 
canadian government specifically requested help he said 
we have one of our vessels over the horizon just out of 
sight trailing along mason said 
mason estimated that the bountiful is about the 10th american 
fishing boat to be accused of poaching in canadian waters this year 
such incidents are on the rise because fishing stocks on the 
us side of the fisheries line are being depleted and the 
canadians are aggressively patrolling their waters he said 
at 1030 pm the bountiful and the cygnus were about 120 miles 
east of cape cod heading toward shore mason said

yves saint laurent has proved once again in his 
show for next winter that classic haute couture can have sex 
appeal 
rich dressy and sexy outfits are about the only common 
denominator in the current crop of couture clothes including 
wednesdays show by madame gres the high priestess of draped greek 
dresses 
the news from saint laurent is that he has burnished his 
classics to a high sheen of chic especially with his use of lame 
brocades in short and long cocktail dresses the huge stiffened 
flounces enveloping the sheaths 
they came in showy colors from rust and amethyst to chartreuse 
midnight blue fuchsia and flame with highlights of silver and 
gold 
saint laurents clothes fuel all the other ysl activities from 
accessories to perfume investors are glad to know that his company 
is still a hot ticket 
when the saint laurent company floated 10 percent of its stock 
on the market earlier this month the issue was 200 times 
oversubscribed and had to be redone under stricter conditions for 
cash only 
saint laurents daytime clothes were perfect in their purity of 
color cut and fabric he led the show with a siren red jersey 
shift and flowing black cape topped by a big cerise scarf and the 
excitement didnt let up 
his new suit style pairs green tan or slate blue full skirts 
with boleros or long jackets with big buttons up the sleeves and 
airylight iridescent blouses in slightly different shades 
there were some trouser suits but they did not dominate knees 
were often bared but a longer fuller skirt length to nearly 
midcalf also got the ysl seal of approval whether skirts were 
short or long they were often topped by fitted jackets loden 
styles or full soft suede blousons plus a high toque or funnel 
hat either bowed or tied in a turban effect 
boots were important they came out in shiny lame cloque brocade 
like many of the jackets and skintight cocktail dresses 
i loved it said saint laurent admirer paloma picasso after 
the show he always finds something new to say with that big 
ruffle in the lame brocade dresses and the colors 
he showed the tiniest heartshaped bustiers in an empire line to 
show off the bosom sometimes pairing this brief note in velvet 
with tulipdraped satin or silk crepe skirts hitched up with a 
floppy bow to show off the legs 
the teal blue chiffon cape over a spotted panther panne velours 
dinner dress with touches of lame earned a hail of wolfwhistles 
and draped chiffons came out in all colors from flame and fuchsia 
to mandarin orange purple and black 
from a tea rose pink satin gown to a richly multicolored chiffon 
dress in renaissance style for the bride saint laurents evening 
collection all had the masters touch of elegance 
dressy clothes with an eye to sex appeal also dominated at the 
younger house of lecoanet hemant didier lecoanet is the creative 
french designer and his indiangerman partner hemant sagar runs 
the business side of things both are in their 30s 
they used hot colors in very fitted suits and dresses often in 
gunmetal cloque or waffled lame brocades and silks as well as 
combinations like flowered royal blue satin and a chartreuse 
eggshaped miniskirt for a showy lateday look 
there were some beautifully draped georgette crepes touches of 
sparkle and heavy guipure lace plus feathers and furs big ruffles 
down the back and other details such as furcuffed gloves 
with so many colors and details the collection tended to lack 
focus but the couture touches were there in these festive clothes 
that came out either very short for a leggy look or elegantly long 
for evening 
madame gres show was a poignant moment of nostalgia now 86 
the grand old lady of couture showed some striking clothes though 
her capable young assistants did most of the execution 
she was not backstage and nobody took a bow after the show

carl gustav christer pettersson 
admitted he was a bum even a killer but not the killer who shot 
prime minister olof palme 
a veteran of one of the worlds most lenient penal systems 
where early releases are routine petterssons criminal record 
lists more than 60 crimes most of them petty theft and assault 
one for manslaughter 
i am a killer but not a murderer he said as his fiveweek 
trial opened june 5 he maintained he was innocent of shooting 
palme on feb 28 1986 
i was a bum he told the court its actually surprising 
that anyone at all has anything positive to say about me 
the 42yearold unemployed swede was arrested in december and 
later charged with the murder 
the trial revealed a life of drug use alcohol abuse and petty 
crime it exposed the complex character of a biblereading loner 
who liked children wrote poetry and scared friends with his 
erratic violent behavior 
pettersson was born into a middleclass family on april 23 
1947 a promising child he read homer at the age of 10 and had no 
evident problems in school until suffering a concussion as a 
teenager 
at 19 he started taking drugs his life took a criminal turn 
and developed into a roller coaster of euphoria jails and mental 
hospitals 
pettersson studied acting in the 1960s but dropped out of 
acting school after being accused of theft 
there were conflicting accounts of his political views or of 
whether he had any 
during the trial he described himself as an admirer of palme 
the fourterm prime minister was a champion of social democratic 
causes and a leading architect of swedens welfare state 
after the slaying pettersson signed several public letters of 
condolence 
however friends testified that pettersson bore a deep hatred 
toward swedens highly structured society where drugs are not 
tolerated and drinking is officially discouraged 
newspapers speculated that he developed a hatred for palme in 
1980 after contacts in jail with a rightwing extremist 
in 1970 pettersson escaped from a mental hospital got into an 
argument with a stranger and killed him with a bayonet 
the slaying occurred close to where palme was gunned down 16 
years later evidence at the time indicated that pettersson fled 
the scene down a small side street the same one taken by palmes 
killer 
pettersson was convicted of manslaughter held in a psychiatric 
ward and released after seven months

the leader of a mohawk warrior faction 
arrested in a the running standoff with state police on the st 
regis reservation is not wanted back on indian territory an fbi 
agent testified wednesday 
the mohawks chiefs said if art montour is returned to the 
akwesasne community it would only aggravate an already volatile 
situation fbi agent john mceligot said at a pretrial detention 
hearing in us district court 
montour 47 leads the mohawk sovreign security force a group 
responsible for the 4dayold armed blockade of the state highway 
that runs through the reservation straddling the st lawrence river 
on the uscanadian border 
the group has vowed not to let police enter the reservation 
montour arrested monday in a clash with state police that 
injured 11 people is accused of using a gun to hold off state 
troopers and fbi agents during a raid last thursday on the 
reservations illegal gambling parlors 
magistrate gustave dibianco who is considering whether bail 
should set for montour adjourned the hearing until friday montour 
is charged with forcibly impeding execution of a search warrant 
through the use of a deadly weapon 
mceligot testified that he interviewed the three chiefs elected 
by reservation residents and recognized by the us government as 
the mohawks leaders and all three said they did not want montour 
allowed to return 
chief lincoln white described him as a disruptive force and 
said if he comes back it would boil again said mceligot 
the chiefs said montour is not a reservation resident and his 
force is not recognized by tribal leaders said mceligot the 
chiefs said montour refused to remove the blockade of route 37 when 
they asked him he testified 
montours arrest monday came during a clash that broke out 
occurred as about 75 mohawks tried to leave the askwesasne 
community to talk with reporters about the raids on the casinos and 
the continuing blockade of the reservation 
about 75 state troopers have been posted at the edge of the 
reservation and have erected roadlocks to keep nonresidents from 
entering the akwsasne community since last thursday 
state police maj ronald brooks said wednesday there were no 
plans to scale back the number of troopers at the reservation or 
remove the roadblocks 
assistant us attorney john brunetti said montour has been 
linked to the 1974 takeover of a girl scout camp in the adirondacks 
in a clash that left two people wounded and with the 1979 seizure 
of the reservations police department and subsequent assault of 
the police chief and three patrolmen 
he was indicted in the 1979 incident but the charges were 
dropped

a state advertisement that used a 
pornographic movie title to lure filmmakers was withdrawn after the 
seattle police chief objected 
the ad proclaiming debbie could have done dallas in 
seattle was run in american cinematographer magazine by the 
state film and video office 
the wording was a play on the xrated movie title debbie does 
dallas 
but seattle police chief patrick fitzsimons wasnt amused 
it was absolutely unnecessary to use a pornographic reference 
to lure business he said that particular film is very 
demeaning to women its decadent 
christine lewis head of the film bureau acknowledged the chief 
had a point she pulled the quarterpage ad which cost taxpayers 
600 
im sorry i ran it she said wednesday we made an error 
of judgment and it wont run again 
we wanted to catch peoples attention with an ad that would 
be eyecatching and humorous and speak to an industry that 
understands what were trying to say lewis said 
she said the ad was intended to publicize the states diversity 
thats one of our selling points that we can look like new 
england or bavaria or la or arizona or the midwest she said 
pornography or permissiveness was the last thing on her mind 
said lewis she said she called fitzsimons to apologize 
this year the state has been the site of 12 films or madefortv

a paraplegic who hauled 
himself up 3200foot el capitan 6 inches at a time over nine days 
using only his powerful arms reached the summit of the challenging 
cliff wednesday 
mark wellman was greeted by fellow park rangers with a tshirt 
reading see you at the top 
im tired he said in a radio conversation with supporters 
at the base of the cliff i have pains where i didnt even know i 
had parts 
its great its fantastic he said it was a really 
great beautiful climb and a really wonderful experience 
he had some advice for others who are physically handicapped 
go out and do it if you feel you can do it just go out and do 
it 
wellman 29 and friend mike corbett started the day about 300 
feet from the top of the granite cliff after spending the night 
tied into sleeping bags on chickenhead ledge wellman covered about 
125 feet in the first two hours and just before noon cut loose his 
extra gear for the final push to the top 
at 150 pm pdt they reached the summit 
no one in my situation has ever done anything like this and 
that im proud of wellman 29 said at a news conference atop 
the rock attended by some 55 reporters friends and park rangers 
who climbed an easy trail i felt like the whole world was 
watching 
wellman and corbett later came down the mountain along a trail 
and arrived at the valley floor at 845 pm wellman rode down on a 
horse they planned to go out to dinner 
corbett who carried wellman the final yards where the peak 
leveled out called his friend a great companion so solid never 
complaining always going for it 
at the top corbett gave his friend a signed photograph of 
yosemite on which he wrote it was an unbelieveable 
experience the pair sipped champagne gulped ice water and 
corbett had a cigarette he had smoked a pack a day during the 
climb and had run out 
the climbers were a day behind schedule they began the grueling 
effort july 18 and had been battling gusting wind and 90degree 
heat 
you have a dream and you know the only way that dream is going 
to happen is if you just do it even if its 6 inches at a 
time wellman told reporters before beginning the climb 
wellman whose legs have been paralyzed since a 1982 fall from 
another yosemite peak became the first paraplegic to make the 
vertical trek doing 7000 pullups on ropes placed by corbett 
the two had said they were really sore and had been pushing to 
finish the climb as early as possible 
awaiting them on top was a sloping granite summit with a stark 
windswept landscape considered one of the most beautiful spots in 
the world a dazzling view includes some of the towering peaks of 
the sierra nevada and half dome another of the parks most famous 
features 
near the ledge they climbed over is a lone contorted ancient 
pine that has greeted thousands of climbers since the face was 
first scaled in 1958 
wellmans companion corbett 35 had previously scaled el 
capitan 41 times more than any other climber he will be reunited 
with his estranged family this weekend because of publicity over 
the climb 
his brother and several others were flying in from houston to 
meet him and the anticipation has distracted him from the climbing 
routine he said he couldnt sleep monday 
ive got to fill my family in on a lot of things that have 
happened in the last 10 years of my life corbett said by radio 
to gwen schneider his girlfriend 
schneider said corbett last talked to his family in 1981 after a 
really traumatic divorce by his parents 
the two climbed as far as they could each day since the weekend 
in hopes of making up a day and a half lost when the climb slowed 
to a vertical crawl 
their biggest problem was wind which wellman said gusted from 
11 am to 8 pm each day sometimes blowing them 10 feet out from 
the cliff face 
the heat was less of a problem but temperatures occasionally 
topped 100 degrees on the face of the cliff 
wellman chose a route that is almost straight up because it was 
more practical for him 
the route included tackling the shield roof a ledge jutting 40 
feet out from the monolith at 2000 feet above yosemite valley the 
two had to dangle beneath it and hoist themselves up a rope with 
valley floor far below them 
wellman was paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50 feet 
during a climb of 13700foot gables peak south of yosemite in 
1982 he was hospitalized for seven months but has since been as 
active as possible staying in shape with sports like kayaking and 
directing the parks program for disabled visitors 
he trained daily for six months for the el capitan climb making 
35 practice climbs on other sheer rocks and training with weights

visitors to the citycounty building can rest 
in style now much to the chagrin of councilman jim ferlo 
the nine new steel and mahogany benches placed in the lobby this 
week cost more than 1600 each 
i know city workers behinds are golden but thats a lot of 
money ferlo said 
general services director dawn botsford said the benches are 
worth the money the lobby has been benchless since may 1988 when 
yellow plastic benches were removed because some officials thought 
they were an eyesore 
we needed benches that would be extremely sturdy that 
couldnt be lifted and stolen and would fit in with the decor of 
the lobby ms botsford said 
bill davis of the city finance department had a mixed opinion 
theyre beautiful theyre a work of art he said but 
added theyre not comfortable to sit in

state highway officials trying to 
assess traffic patterns near this southern missouri army base gave 
new meaning to the military tradition of hurry up and wait 
from 7 am to 8 am tuesday officials from the missouri 
department of highways and transportation closed one southbound 
lane of a highway leading to the base officials pulled over every 
fifth driver to determine where they were coming from where they 
were going and why 
the result was a threehour traffic jam that caused more than 
1500 employees to arrive late for work at the base and left some 
motorists fuming 
the survey was to continue until aug 3 said tom keith a state 
traffic engineer 
we will reevaluate it and see if we can do it another way 
keith said the department may send out questionnaires or place an 
automatic counter on the road he said 
tuesdays survey showed 748 cars entered the post every 15 
minutes during rush hour army spokeswoman charlotte wiggins said

a plan to print the friendship state on 
texas license plates has stirred up gubernatorial candidates who 
say texans are too tough for such a slogan 
its wimpy said democratic state treasurer ann richards 
the first of the gubernatorial hopefuls to join the chorus of 
opponents to the slogan approved last week by the state highway and 
public transportation commission 
friendship is too generic a term for texas where the tough 
dont mess with texas antilittering slogan has proven so 
popular ms richards said 
i think the reason the dont mess with texas thing has been 
so successful is that it sort of continues that image that were 
great were wonderful we think we are she said the friendly 
state you could put that on kansas ohio 
ms richards said she agreed with hundreds of callers who have 
suggested putting the lone star state nickname on plates 
jack rains the former secretary of state who launched his 
republican gubernatorial bid tuesday agreed 
i kind of like the lone star state rains said the rest 
of that stuff looked a little quiche and chablis to me 
attorney general jim mattox who is seeking the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination said newspapers should run ballots with 
several slogan options that people could mail in 
that way we wouldnt have to go through an expensive ballot 
proposition of having the public actually vote on the matter but 
the people would have the decisionmaking in their hands mattox 
said 
indeed two news organizations have found strong opposition to 
the license plates 
some 4000 people responded to a phonein poll by the dallas 
times herald and 64 percent were against the new plates in 
houston the negative vote was even more resounding more than 2700 
viewers who called khoutv and 89 percent said they opposed the 
new design

space shuttle columbia is scheduled 
to lift off aug 8 on a mission with five military astronauts and a 
classified pentagon spy satellite 
nasa selected the date wednesday at the conclusion of a twoday 
flight review that assessed the readiness of the orbiter payload 
global tracking network and all other mission elements 
columbia will be making the 30th shuttle flight and the fourth 
solely dedicated to the defense department the astronauts 
reportedly will release a sophisticated reconnaissance satellite 
for national security reasons the pentagon would not permit the 
national aeronautics and space administration to announce an exact 
liftoff time or the length of the mission once columbia is 
orbiting a news blackout will be in effect until about an hour 
before landing 
the announcement said only that launch would occur between 730 
am and 1130 am edt on aug 8 the countdown will be made 
public nine minutes before the planned liftoff 
columbias crew members are air force col brewster shaw the 
commander navy cmdr richard richards navy cmdr david leestma 
air force lt col james adamson and air force maj mark brown 
when nasa officials began the review meeting tuesday a 
potential problem with a fuel valve existed they said that if 
engineers had to replace it the launch would have to be delayed two 
or three days beyond the targeted date 
but the problem turned out to be a false sensor reading and 
nasa qualified the valve for flight on wednesday 
the flight will be the eighth for columbia the oldest of the 
shuttles and its first in 3 years following the challenger 
explosion in january 1986 columbia was the last of the three 
remaining shuttles to receive more than 200 safety and performance 
modifications 
changes were completed earlier on discovery and atlantis and 
each has been launched twice since postchallenger flights resumed 
last september

president wojciech jaruzelski said he 
rejected solidaritys offer to take over the government because 
polands communist neighbors would not approve a top opposition 
lawmaker told colleagues 
gen jaruzelski also criticized the free trade union movement 
for demanding a more representative government but spurning his bid 
to form a governing coalition said the lawmaker jozef slisz 
later wednesday solidarity lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to 
reject jaruzelskis offer to join the communists in a governing 
coalition and decided it would not be useful for members to 
accept government posts individually 
slisz deputy speaker of the senate and head of the independent 
farmers union rural solidarity said jaruzelski told him during a 
meeting tuesday that he would not nominate solidarity to form the 
next government 
he justified it this way that if we took over the whole 
government all the adjoining countries would be looking at us 
askance slisz told the caucus of solidarity lawmakers he 
mentioned first of all east germany czechoslovakia and the 
russians 
jaruzelskis comments indicated resistance among the ruling 
communists in those nations to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs call for warsaw pact allies not to interfere with a 
neighbors moves toward democracy 
solidarity leader lech walesa also met with jaruzelski on 
tuesday and rejected participation in a governing coalition saying 
it was inevitable that solidarity would eventually govern 
slisz said jaruzelski criticized the opposition for screaming 
about pluralism but rejecting an offer to take part in the 
government 
besides one of several deputy prime ministers posts jaruzelski 
was willing to offer the ministries of health building ecology 
and industry slisz said 
the offer elicited derisive laughter from the solidarity caucus 
the ministries named are responsible for some of polands worst 
problems the economy is in disarray with consumer shortages daily 
becoming more acute 
the opposition believes its success in last months historic 
parliamentary elections entitles it to take over the government 
solidaritybacked candidates won all but one of the seats they were 
allowed to contest in the soviet blocs freest elections since the 
postwar communist takeover 
slisz said jaruzelski advised the opposition to take a few 
ministries now work at reducing the bureaucracy and prepare for 
taking power in the future 
solidaritys parliamentary leader deputy bronislaw geremek 
said the communists do not want to give up the government because 
that would mean the end of their patronage system with thousands 
of party functionaries fired 
why do authorities not agree to the opposition forming the 
government he said because they have no chance of 
surviving in such a situation 
jaruzelski elected president by the bare minimum of votes in 
parliament last week may announce who he will nominate to form the 
next government when parliament convenes next week 
the central committee of the communist party scheduled a meeting 
friday and saturday to approve his decision at that time 
jaruzelski is expected to quit as party leader in keeping with a 
preelection promise 
walesa said after meeting jaruzelski tuesday that if solidarity 
was not be allowed to form the entire government it would remain 
in opposition and form a shadow cabinet 
the stance against joining a coalition was endorsed by 
solidarity lawmakers in an overwhelming show of hands although 
some of them complained that walesa should have consulted them 
first 
in april solidarity was reinstated after a sevenyear ban and 
the ruling communists agreed to allow the free trade union movement 
to enter parliament as an opposition party

dealing with iran remains the best option for 
winning the release of nine americans held in lebanon but the 
united states must not rule out talking to the captors or paying 
ransom according to a study on terrorism released today 
the rand corp report also contends that iran continues to 
overestimate the importance of the hostages to the us government 
the fate of the hostages is a matter of concern but it 
is not a central issue the study said the government is under 
no immediate pressure from the public to bring the hostages home 
the longest held of the americans is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press anderson was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
veteran terrorist researcher brian michael jenkins said in the 
report terrorism policy issues for the bush administration 
that hostages provide a group with a certain amount of prestige 
iran the study said has lost much of its strategic importance 
to the united states in part because of improved ussoviet 
relations and because world oil production remains high and 
comparatively cheap 
to put it bluntly in a way that no us official can say 
publicly washington can wait for a more receptive government in 
iran even as dealing through iran remains our best bet for 
getting the hostages released according to the report 
but jenkins said there are powerful forces in iran who 
continue to oppose any kind of rapprochement with the west 
none of the alternatives look very promising jenkins wrote 
threatening the captors or tehran with military retaliation 
has emotional appeal but is not likely to work and might 
imperil the hostages rescue is a long shot especially if we 
are concerned with getting the hostages out alive 
that leaves ransom a distasteful course of action but one 
which should not be ruled out entirely jenkins said adding that 
the us noconcession policy that emerged after the irancontra 
arms scandal has become dangerously rigid 
most nations subscribe to noconcessions policies in theory 
he said in practice however many of them have made deals to 
obtain the release of their citizens held hostage although they 
may deny that the apparent concessions were part of any deal or 
argue that these things were done for loftier purposes 
even israel the nation seen to exemplify the hard line has 
on several occasions made concessions to obtain the release of 
hostages 
part of the problem the report said is that the captors have 
not been clear or consistent about exactly what they want in return 
for the release of the hostages 
the rand corp a santa monica califbased private nonprofit 
organization sponsors research often under government contract 
on issues affecting national security 
though the terrorism study was spawned by an earlier project 
sponsored by the defense department rand said it paid for the 
report out of its own funds

president fidel castro told his countrymen 
that the united states is eager to exploit recent setbacks in the 
socialist world and may emulate nazi germany by trying to establish 
a 1000year colonial empire 
standing bareheaded in a drizzle for almost two hours wednesday 
night castro said cuba must brace itself for the worst if the 
world socialist movement collapses 
castro said the united states might try to invade and occupy 
cuba defeat cuba in a war of attrition or blockade the island 
when castro spoke about the triumphal attitude of president 
bush because of political and economic problems facing socialism 
the chief us diplomat in cuba jay taylor walked out 
if socialism disappears castro said the imperialist powers 
would divide the world just as they did in the worst of times 
before the 1917 russian revolution 
the occasion for the speech was the 36th anniversary of the 
armed attack that signaled the beginning of castros struggle 
against the dictatorship he ousted in 1959 
by the time he finished his speech much of his green military 
uniform was soaked as were many of the tens of thousand who turned 
out for the speech 
castros address was split into two parts for the first hour 
and 10 minutes he praised the economic and social progress the 
revolution has brought to this farming area 300 miles east of 
havana 
the second part lasting just under 40 minutes represented one 
of the gloomiest assessments of the world situation that castro 
ever has offered 
imperialist circles are dreaming about an empire of 1000 
years as in his time adolf hitler did castro said 
but he said any such effort would be no more successful than 
hitlers 
at a time when tensions between east and west seem to be at 
postwar low castros remarks struck a somewhat incongruous note 
he not only attacked the united states he was openly concerned 
about the ability of the soviet union to survive the nationalist 
uprisings and other problems afflicting the country 
castro raised the possibility that cubans might wake up some 
morning and learn that civil war has broken out in the soviet union 
or that the country has disintegrated 
even in this circumstance cuba will continue fighting and 
will continue struggling castro said 
he said problems in the soviet union could lead to an aid 
cutback and force cubans to tighten their belts according to us 
estimates cuba receives more than 6 billion in economic and 
military aid from the soviets each year 
he said the news that hundreds of thousands of miners in the 
soviet union are on strike fills the imperialists with joy 
the dream of the imperialists is for the soviet union to 
disintegrate he said he also denounced what he said were 
fascist tendencies in poland where soldarity made huge gains 
last month year in the countrys freest elections in four decades 
castro was expected to discuss the corruption and drug 
trafficking that resulted in the executions two weeks ago of four 
highranking officers including gen arnaldo ochoa a cuban 
military hero 
however he ignored the issue

an agriculture department economist says 
american farmers can suffer when overseas competitors run into 
severe economic problems soybeans and wheat are a case in point 
gregory gajewski of the departments economic research service 
said brazil and argentina were examples of countries with large 
international debt burdens domestic pressures and rapid inflation 
in argentina prices of farm inputs rose 17 percent in 
march nearly 80 percent in may and more than 100 percent in june 
he said in brazil these inputs or items needed for farm 
production rose more than 1000 percent last year and are still 
going up 
both countries are major exporters of agricultural commodities 
brazil is a prime competitor of the united states in soybeans and 
argentina is a traditional wheat exporter 
gajewski said a critical factor in the two countries has been 
their governmentcontrolled exchange rates 
brazils currency the novo cruzado was overvalued by 20 
percent to 40 percent earlier this year he said but the 
government was reluctant to devalue because devaluations add to 
shortterm inflation 
with the overvalued currency and dropping world soybean 
prices the prices brazilian bean growers received were too low 
cover costs gajewski writes in the august issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine to protest the growers stopped selling their 
soybeans for two weeks in june 
he added though the government responded with a 12 percent 
devaluation half the crop remains to be sold sales likely will be 
concentrated in the next few months 
the usda has estimated brazils 198889 soybean harvest at a 
record 22 million metric tons and expects exports to be up by 
about twothirds from last season but the department expects 
198990 production to be down and that exports will remain about 
the same 
brazilian bean output has grown 45 percent in the 1980s 
gajewski said but had the economic growth not faltered under 
the heavy international debt burden much of this extra bean output 
could have gone to support the thengrowing chicken industry 
instead with peoples incomes off local demand for meat 
fell and soybean exports surged so us farmers face more 
competition in the world bean market 
in argentina wheat production is expected to increase this 
year reflecting a recovery from drought higher world prices and 
recent policy reforms by a newly elected president 
currency was devalued by more than 50 percent this month and 
the new government has cut interest rates on shortterm 
agricultural credit 
both moves combined with recent good weather increased 
farmers incentives to grow wheat for export gajewski said 
consequently usda boosted its projection of argentine wheat 
exports in 198990 by 7 percent 
bottom line us farmers will feel some extra competition in 
the world wheat market because of policy decisions made in buenos 
aires he said

the agriculture department says a mystery 
fungus perhaps from japan has riddled gypsy moths in the 
northeast this summer and may turn into a new weapon against the 
destructive pests 
this is the first time a fungus has been known to cause a 
massive dieoff of gypsy moth caterpillars in north america said 
entomologist ann hajek of the departments agricultural research 
service i saw single trees with thousands of caterpillar 
corpses 
hajek based at the agencys laboratory in ithaca ny has 
been working to identify the fungus which was found in the western 
connecticut towns of wilton and hamden she said the same fungus 
probably killed the pests in areas of massachusetts new york new 
jersey pennsylvania and new hampshire 
whatever the fungus is its definitely an addition to our 
arsenal of weapons against gypsy moths she said wednesday in a 
report by the agency it could provide a new method for 
biological control for these pests 
hajek said its possible that the fungus is entomophaga

the 65 mph speed limit on most rural 
interstate highways is prompting more fastcar ads encouraging 
speeding and killing more people according to an insurance 
industry report 
the report presented to congress on wednesday by the insurance 
institute for highway safety concludes that 550 of the 2485 deaths 
on rural interstate highways last year were caused by the 65 mph 
limit 
a federal highway official also said higher speeds on 65 mph 
roads may be causing more deaths but a spokesman for a motorists 
group said 1988 fatality statistics are being misinterpreted 
actual 1988 deaths on rural interstates increased 34 percent 
over the 198286 average in 38 states that raised the speed limit 
to 65 mph in 1987 brian oneill insurance institute president 
told a house transportation subcommittee 
the institute concluded by comparing the data with fatality 
figures on all roads that 550 of the 1988 deaths were 
statistically due to the higher speed limit that represents a 30 
percent increase over the 198286 average with the other 4 percent 
due to other factors 
the 65 mph limit has been adopted by 40 states with virginia 
and georgia excluded from the institute study because they 
increased speeds only last year no statebystate analysis of 
fatalities was provided 
fatalities on all highways increased only 15 percent last year 
interstate accidents caused about 6 percent of the 47479 road 
deaths according to transportation department figures 
will fox spokesman for citizens for rational traffic laws of 
dane wis told reporters after the hearing that higher speeds do 
not kill more people he said the fatality statistics are 
misleading because they do not factor in the number of miles 
traveled 
the group which said it represents 15000 serious and 
knowledgeable motorists called the 65 mph limit the first step 
in restoring credibility and respect for posted speed limits 
oneill in the insurance institute report said car ads imply 
speeding is fun and has no consequences 
he criticized ads for the porsche 928s which describe it as 
an attractive alternative to air travel acura which says its 
cars interiors are designed at 125 mph and subaru which 
advises potential buyers to catch us doing 90 which oneill 
said is a double reference to the model year and to speed 
muscle cars just arent compatible with safety oneill said 
in his report 
he said evidence shows that because of the 65 mph limit more 
motorists are driving at 70 75 and even 80 mph or higher 
its true that speeding isnt as rampant now as it was in the 
waning months of the 55 mph oneill acknowledged but people 
arent automatically abiding by 65 either 
proponents of the 65 mph limit said it would decrease the number 
of drivers breaking speeding laws 
jeffrey r miller acting head of the national highway traffic 
safety administration said 1988 traffic fatalities are still being 
studied and nhtsa will issue its second report on the 65 mph speed 
limit in september the first in january was inconclusive 
miller said fatalities on all rural interstates were 13 percent 
higher than in 1987 which he described as statistically 
significant 
the overall pattern of the last two years suggests that an 
increase in actual speeds on the 65 mph highways may be 
contributing to the increase in fatalities he said 
however in a statement submitted with millers testimony the 
agency said that until the september study is released it would 
be premature to reach a definitive conclusion on the safety effects 
of the 65 mph speed limit

a pentagon paper being drafted outlines a 
series of options including a direct role for us troops to help 
stem the flow of cocaine into the united states from south america 
a military source says 
the list of possible scenarios the officer said wednesday on 
the condition of anonymity will be turned over to defense 
secretary dick cheney to be included in the national drug strategy 
to be released sept 5 by drug czar william bennett 
the defense department isnt saying what its role should be to 
fight drugs overseas an idea promoted by president bush before his 
election during his campaign he called for an international 
strike force to hit back quick and hard and often at foreign drug 
operations to stop cocaine at its source 
but programs run by the state department and the drug 
enforcement administration have all but ceased in peru and bolivia 
where the majority of the worlds coca grows along the slopes of 
the andes mountains the government puts the blame on increased 
maoist guerrilla activity in the upper huallaga valley in peru as 
well as the south american governments refusal to use aerial 
herbicides to eradicate the coca plants 
do we put our men on the front line the officer said 
listing one of the options and how will it go over in topeka 
when the first body bag comes home 
he said the possibilities for overseas action range from 
increased training of foreign military and law enforcement 
officials to direct actions by the armys special forces known as 
the green berets and other elite military units 
the national security council which was preparing a report to 
be included in the national plan reportedly backs the idea of 
larger use of american troops to curb cocaine in south america 
an administration source however dubbed the idea of direct 
intervention effectively a dead issue because the us 
government could not bring military troops into peru or bolivia 
without an invitation which would be unlikely 
at a news conference wednesday the defense departments 
coordinator for drug enforcement policy and support stephen m 
duncan briefed reporters on the pentagons drug efforts but 
skirted questions about a direct interdiction role 
mr bennett will make recommendations presumably to the 
president on anything outside of the borders of the us and well 
be prepared to do anything the president asks us to do duncan 
said 
instead duncan focused on the defense departments moves to cut 
drug use within its ranks saying that there had been an 82 percent 
decline since 1982 he said 27 percent of the american military 
personnel in 1980 used drugs and that figure dropped to 48 
percent last year 
he credited the reduction to random drug testing which he said 
will continue for soldiers civilian personnel and contractors

dill will be called to testify before a grand jury investigating 
whether his son regularly reported to work when he was on the 
payroll of the district of columbias congressional delegate 
sources say 
the justice department is investigating thomas john savage who

the bush administration will keep trying to 
persuade the palestine liberation organization to participate 
without conditions in an israeli election plan now that yasser 
arafats group has endorsed the concept 
the problem state department officials disclosed wednesday is 
that the plo wants a guaranteed outcome that includes the 
establishment of a palestinian state 
even while the plo position was being outlined in public for the 
first time us ambassador robert pelletreau jr was having 
another session in tunisia with hakam ballaoui the plo 
representative in the north african country 
details were not disclosed a brief state department 
announcement said only that several issues related to the 
dialogue were discussed 
the united states and israel oppose statehood for the 14 
palestinian arabs who prime minister yitzhak shamir is trying to 
persuade to take part in elections leading to limited selfrule 
without plo approval the idea is unlikely to go anywhere 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman called the 
plo precondition unacceptable she refused to say whether the 
usbacked election proposal had been harmed or helped by the 
plos acceptance of the concept with strings attached 
what she and other officials left clear however is that the 
united states will keep talking about the election proposal to the 
plo in tunisia where the group is headquartered as the most 
opportune way to open mideast negotiations 
shamir envisions elected palestinians negotiating with israel a 
fiveyear selfrule arrangement that would be followed by talks 
also involving egypt and jordan on an overall settlement 
other state department sources said the plo also demanded that 
israel agree in advance to trade territory for peace 
reports in israeli newspapers said a us memorandum outlining 
the plo position was conveyed to jerusalem possibly through 
soviet diplomats 
the united states meets periodically with the soviet union on 
regional problems including the arabisraeli conflict the last 
such session on the middle east was held here june 1516 
ms tutwiler said no us memorandum had been prepared but 
other sources in the department said american diplomats prepared 
written summaries of discussions with the plo on at least two 
occasions they said these summaries were not given to the soviets 
the united states broke its isolation of the plo last december 
after chairman arafat at us urging said publicly he renounced 
terrorism and accepted israels right to exist 
a series of meetings have been held since in tunisia between 
pelletreau and various plo officials not all of them publicly 
disclosed two such involved salah khalaf secondincommand to 
arafat known also as abu iyad he has been described as the 
suspected mastermind of the murder of 11 israeli olympic athletes 
in munich in 1972 and two us diplomats in the sudan in 1973 
the senate reacted last week by passing an amendment to restrict 
us contacts with the plo president bush on tuesday called the 
legislation unconstitutional and did not promise there would be no 
further us talks with arafats deputy 
ms tutwiler said us officials are pressing for movement 
on the election concept and to begin a dialogue between israelis 
and palestinians in the occupied territories 
the spokeswoman added that the plo has told us privately as 
it has said publicly that it supports the election concept as part 
of a comprehensive peace plan however the plo has put a number of 
conditions on its support for elections which would prejudge the 
outcome of a negotiated solution 
ms tutwiler said these conditions are not acceptable to us 
this is a key issue which we continue to discuss in our dialogue 
with the plo 
the only condition she was willing to cite was a plo demand for 
an independent palestinian state 
the bush administration opposes establishment of a palestinian 
state however bush has demanded that israel yield west bank and 
gaza territory thereby matching another plo demand that was 
reiterated by the plo in the talks in tunisia

the bush administration dropping the 
objections of its predecessor is supporting proposed legislation 
to ban the production stockpiling and export of biological weapons 
the measures being considered by both the house and senate are 
designed to enable the justice department to prosecute americans 
who develop stockpile or export biological weapons to terrorists 
or to unstable third world governments 
this is the third time congress has tried to adopt legislation 
that would give teeth to a 1972 treaty outlawing germ warfare 
previous attempts in 1973 and again in 1980 failed 
the reagan administration refused to support such legislation 
saying existing laws banning export of hazardous materials were 
sufficient 
but theres no law that permits the authorities to stop the 
weapon from being produced in the first place said sen herb 
kohl dwis one of the bills sponsors 
biological weapons described by some as the poor mans atom 
bomb are relatively easy to produce and a very small amount can 
cause a widespread outbreak of deadly disease 
thomas graham general counsel of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said wednesday that recent developments led the 
administration to agree with congress that specific laws on germ 
warfare were needed 
the advances in biotechnology and the desire of third world 
nations to acquire biological weapons lent urgency to the need for 
such laws he told the senate judiciary committee 
we feel that passage of such legislation would give a 
clear signal to the world that the united states is serious about 
controlling the proliferation of biological weapons said 
assistant secretary of state h allen holmes 
but holmes conceded that preventing the export of such deadly 
agents was all but impossible because the chemicals organisms and 
equipment used to produce weapons also are used for medical and 
agricultural purposes and can be presented in the guise of 
legitimate exports 
holmes said about 10 countries are thought to be working on 
developing biological weapons although he declined to name any 
except the soviet union 
other officials have identified syria and iraq as two of the 
countries engaging in such research 
to date we have no information that any known terrorist 
organization has the capability to employ such weapons nor that 
states supporting terrorism have supplied such weapons holmes 
said however we cannot dismiss those possibilities 
the united states renounced biological warfare in 1969 and 
destroyed its stockpile of weapons 
representatives of the multimilliondollar biotechnological 
industries and scientific community expressed concern that the 
bills would interfere with their research by making it possible for 
law enforcement agents to seize and destroy toxins before 
determining whether their purpose was legitimate

a us customs investigation not a newfound 
cuban determination to stop drug trafficking led that country to 
bring charges that led to the execution of four officials says 
customs commissioner william von raab 
the investigation codenamed operation greyhound discovered 
that theninterior minister jose abrantes fernandez who oversaw 
the border guards among other duties had directed elite cuban 
forces to oversee drug transfers on cuban territory von raab told 
a senate panel wednesday 
abrantes was fired june 29 in the midst of the trial of the four 
officials including a hero of the cuban revolution gen arnaldo 
ochoa that resulted in their execution two weeks ago no charges 
have been brought against abrantes a state department official 
said 
von raab told the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
terrorism narcotics and international operations that he thinks 
operation greyhound begun in february was probably what pushed 
the prosecution of ochoa and three colleagues 
the commissioner who was reading a document marked secret 
at the start of the hearing told reporters later that the cubans 
found out about operation greyhound either through an escaped 
prisoner or maybe the state department told them about us 
melvyn levitsky the assistant secretary of state for 
international narcotics matters dismissed the latter allegation as 
nonsense 
customs spokesman dick weart said a man named gustavo fernandez 
had been in customs custody but escaped june 12 and the incident 
is under investigation by the services internal affairs bureau 
von raab said customs confidential informant whom he 
identified only as the owner of an offshore racing team said 
abrantes was providing the special troops to help with drug 
smuggling 
minister abrantes has provided security for transhipment of 
drugs into the united states von raab told the senate panel 
operation greyhound began in february he said 
it was not clear if he had been receiving money personally for 
the services or had been acting at castros orders he said 
cuban president fidel castro is just another piece of 
narcotrash floating in the caribbean he said he is looking 
to the united states for a life preserver by requesting 
cooperation in the drug war i suggest we throw him an anchor 
during the hearing several senators expressed concern about 
castros overtures with sen jesse helms rnc saying that if 
state department officials are taken in by castros pleas for 
cooperation theyre even bigger suckers than i think they are 
sen robert graham dfla said he wants the united states to 
undertake a series of actions similar to those in the 1960s 
during the cuban missile crisis the united states imposed a 
blockade of the island until the soviet union agreed to pull out 
missiles it had installed there and promised not to install new 
ones 
but the administration officials including levitsky and michael 
kozak the assistant secretary of state who heads the 
interamerican affairs bureau assured the panel that they also 
were skeptical about the prospects for real cooperation 
they said they believed castro has known for years about the 
cuban militarys involvement in drug trafficking and that the 
administration has not yet determined why castro had held the trial 
and executions 
levitsky outlined a series of five steps cuba must take before 
the united states will take its offer of cooperation seriously 
those steps include the extradition of people wanted on drug 
charges in the united states such as fugitive financier robert 
vesco and the breakoff of ties and aid to panamas gen manuel 
antonio noriega

president bush is giving a new push to 
research on a highspeed space plane but delaying until 1993 the 
moment of judgment on whether to build it 
the white house said wednesday that bush had accepted the 
recommendation of vice president dan quayle and the space council 
to extend the timetable for developing the technology for the 
national aerospace plane which would take off and land like a 
plane but fly through the upper atmosphere at 25 times the speed of 
sound 
the plane proposed by president reagan in 1986 had been in 
danger of being abandoned by a reluctant pentagon 
the technology development program was jeopardized in april when 
defense secretary dick cheney proposed slashing its budget from 
300 million to 100 million in fiscal 1990 and to zero in 1991 
but bush has declared it a high priority national effort 
and the pentagon has agreed to continue joint program management 
with nasa and to provide an increasing share of its budget 
unmanned as well as manned designs will be considered and the 
program will be conducted in such a way as to minimize technical 
and cost uncertainty the white house said in a statement 
the bush administration will press for 254 million for the 
project for fiscal 1990 split equally between the pentagon and 
national aeronautics and space administration budgets 
the deadline for a decision on whether to build an actual 
experimental craft will be pushed back from late 1990 to early 
1993 that means the earliest date for an actual flight would be 
delayed from 1996 or 1997 until 2000 administration officials said 
instead of working on building an actual prototype craft 
research will be aimed at finding out whether it is technically 
feasible to build an airbreathing hypersonic engine capable of 
flying at mach 25 the craft would need new materials capable of 
withstanding atmospheric heat of up to 5000 degrees fahrenheit 
the supersonic concorde by comparison flies at mach 15 or 1 
times the speed of sound 
if proved feasible the same technology could be used to build 
both civilian and military aircraft said a bush administration 
official who asked not to be identified 
it would revolutionize air travel to a certain degree said 
the official adding that even reagans dream of a twohour flight 
from new york to tokyo might be possible reagan had dubbed the 
plane the orient express 
under the new plan the pentagon would provide 127 million in 
fiscal 1990 158 million in 1991 and 233 million in 1992 nasa 
contributions would drop from 127 million to 119 million to 72 
million over the same period

if the house ethics committee launches a 
preliminary investigation of republican whip newt gingrich the 
panels top republican says it will cover anything we see 
including new questions about possible payroll irregularities 
rep john t myers rind said wednesday the committee could 
decide as early as next week whether to begin a formal 
investigation of gingrich who initiated the ethics probe that 
forced former speaker jim wright from office in june 
rep bill alexander dark asked the committee in april to 
investigate whether a book promotion partnership created by 
gingrich in 1984 violated house rules and federal campaign finance 
laws 
the committee announced tuesday it hired the chicago law firm 
that spearheaded the wright investigation to review the complaint 
against gingrich and recommend whether to proceed with a fullscale 
inquiry 
if we vote for a preliminary inquiry we would look at 
everything myers said when asked about disclosures this week 
that gingrich gave large temporary pay raises to aides including 
some who had resigned briefly to work in his campaign 
gingrich did not respond to repeated requests from the 
associated press this week for comment on the pay raise reports 
which first surfaced in an atlanta business publication 
he said in a written statement however that temporary 
yearend raises are commonly used by house members to reward 
hardworking staffers and that aides who work in his campaign 
receive no special treatment when such raises are handed out 
house payroll records show that gingrich gave temporary raises 
to 15 aides last fall including two who took leaves for campaign 
work he gave similar raises to 13 aides in both 1987 and 1986 
including two in 1986 who took leaves to work in his reelection 
campaign 
myers said he didnt know whether it was a widespread practice 
for house members to give aides who worked on their campaigns a 
temporary raise after they return 
if true it would be troubling he said it would violate 
the spirit of the house we do not want to use government funds to 
fund our campaigns 
a spot check of the payroll records of gingrichs nine house 
colleagues from georgia found four who gave aides large temporary 
raises last year and one rep john lewis of atlanta who gave an 
aide a onemonth pay increase of 27 percent 15 days after he 
returned from a twomonth campaign leave 
house personnel rules state that yearend raises should be 
made only on a permanent basis and only when the services of the 
individual warrant federal law and house rules also prohibit 
members from rewarding staff members for campaign work 
gingrichs 1988 campaign paid press secretary sheila ward 1612 
and executive assistant sarah grewe 1262 during their onemonth 
leaves from his congressional payroll 
based on their pay rates when the leaves began ward would have 
earned 1606 and grewe 1500 if they had stayed on the 
congressional payroll that month after returning in midnovember 
temporary raises gave ward 1979 more than she would have made the 
rest of the year at her old rate grewe earned an additional 1986 
the other 13 gingrich congressional aides who received large 
temporary raises during the final quarter of 1988 had their overall 
pay boosted by amounts ranging from 9 percent to 449 percent or 
from 400 to 3392 
all 15 staffers had their pay reduced jan 1 though their new 
salaries still were between 4 percent and 33 percent higher than 
the previous october

a probe into mayor tom bradleys financial 
dealings is heating up with the city council president demanding a 
speedup in the investigation and the city attorney denying hes 
dragging his heels 
the delay in the completion of your investigation and report 
is a matter of increasing concern to me the public and to many 
other members of the council council president john ferraro 
wrote in a letter delivered wednesday to city attorney james k 
hahns office 
the letter said hahn should seek outside help to speed up the 
investigation 
until this occurs there will be further erosion in the 
publics confidence in government and in the ability of its elected 
officials to conduct the business of the city ferraro wrote 
bradley recently elected to a fifth term has denied any 
wrongdoing but the hearings and inquiries into his financial 
affairs constitutes the gravest crisis of his 16year tenure as 
mayor on tuesday he dismissed speculation he might resign 
hahn who was elected to office and is not aligned with the 
mayor responded within hours to the letter with one of his own 
in a letter to ferraro the attorney said he expected to report 
by midseptember he said hiring outside counsel would be costly 
and unnecessary and took exception to charges the investigation 
was taking too long 
the allegations against the mayor that have arisen in this 
politically charged atmosphere require thorough and careful 
examination he wrote neither the mayor the council nor the 
people of this city would be served by a rush to judgment 
the mayors financial dealings were revealed in published 
reports in march the city attorney has been investigating 
bradleys transactions for more than a month 
the council is investigating whether bradley influenced the 
award of 2 million in city deposits to far east national bank for 
which bradley served as a paid consultant until he resigned the 
position amid controversy last spring 
investigators learned the deposits had circumvented competitive 
bidding procedures and came shortly after bradley talked on the 
telephone to city treasurer leonard rittenberg 
on monday auditors disclosed the phrase per the mayor was 
blotted out on a worksheet detailing city investments in far east 
bradley and rittenberg have denied the mayor influenced the 
investment 
on wednesday bill hoss a member of the city treasurers staff 
told a city council committee he believed that an audit conducted 
by the city administrative office was aimed at him 
ive come to the conclusion that this audit of the cao is 
intended to create a web of conspiracy said hoss who was 
testifying about how certain city financial documents came to be 
altered by correction fluid 
hoss denied he altered the documents one involved far east 
national bank other documents changed by using correction fluid 
involved gibraltar savings and loan where bradley held a bond at 
favorable interest rates 
hoss testifying before the citys finance and revenue 
committee said the audits intent was to develop a conspiracy 
involving the mayor bill hoss and gibraltar 
councilman zev yaroslavsky who chaired the hearing said many 
of hoss statements were contradictory 
the hearings are examining how city financial documents came to 
be altered and seek to determine if bradley used his influence to 
secure favorable treatment for financial institutions to which he 
was linked

troops captured a prominent communist 
leader and his commonlaw wife today in what the government hailed 
as a major breakthrough in the 20year struggle against the rebels 
satur ocampo 50 a former journalist and carolina malay 49 
were arrested about 10 am as they drove along a residential 
street in suburban makati the military said 
ocampo who escaped from prison in 1985 is believed to be a 
member of the central committee of the banned communist party of 
the philippines and leader of the partys affiliated organizations 
he and malay negotiated with the government on behalf of the 
rebel national democratic front during peace talks that collapsed 
in january 1987 
the military believes ocampo also is chairman of the front an 
umbrella organization of 12 banned marxist groups malay is 
believed to be his deputy 
last week the military offered a 23800 reward each for their 
capture 
as far as we are concerned the capture is a breakthrough 
particularly in terms of further weakening the insurgency said 
noel tolentino a spokesman for president corazon aquino 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
said he hoped the arrest would mark a turning point in the 
insurgency but may allow younger more vigorous leaders to emerge 
in rebel ranks 
earlier today brig gen alexander aguirre manila regional 
commander said troops had raided 23 suspected rebel safe 
houses throughout the capital in an operation that began late 
wednesday 
ocampo who was presented to reporters at a military camp said 
he and malay were riding in their car when another vehicle overtook 
and cut them off three pistolwielding soldiers jumped from the 
car and arrested them he said 
my arrest is part of the armed struggle and does not mean 
significant change in the movement ocampo told reporters malay 
said that others would take their place as long as the government 
continues to ignore the plight of the people 
ocampo repeated rebel calls for new peace talks to discuss a 
solution to social problems the rebels have offered peace talks 
if mrs aquino closes the six us military bases here 
ocampo was one of the best known figures in the shadowy rebel 
movement he served as business editor of the manila times 
newspaper until it was closed when president ferdinand marcos 
declared martial law in september 1972 
ocampo was arrested in 1976 and charged with rebellion and 
subversion but was never brought to trial 
he escaped in may 1985 when he was allowed to leave prison to 
vote in elections for the national press club ocampo then slipped 
away from his six military escorts and went underground 
he resurfaced in 1986 after mrs aquino took power and began 
peace talks with the rebels 
ocampo malay and the third member of the rebel negotiating 
team antonio zumel were at the time granted safe conduct 
passes enabling them to move freely in manila without fear of

borrowing hamlets soliloquy from william 
shakespeare rep edward j markey dmass argued on the house 
floor against the b2 stealth bomber here is the text of his 
statement 
b2 or not b2 that is the question 
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
the slings and arrows of outrageous expense 
or to take arms against a sea of deficits 
and by opposing end them to cut to spend 
no more and by a cut to say we end 
the heartache and a thousand cost overruns 
that b2 is heir to tis a consummation 
devoutly to be wished to cut to spend 
to spend perchance stretchout ay theres the rub 
for in those stretchouts what new overruns may come 
when we have shuffled off deciding 
must give us pause theres the respect 
that makes calamity of delay 
for would stealth bear the whips and scorns of time 
the lack of mission the untried technology 
the great expense the inevitable delays 
the excessive secrecy and the cuts 
that must be made for grammrudman targets sake 
when we ourselves might today stealths termination make 
with a bare majority who would new tax burdens bear 
to pay its 70 billion price tag 
when the dread of a turkey worse than b1 
a flying batwinged bomber whose cost per pound 
is that of gold puzzles the mind 
and makes us rather keep those bombers that we now have 
than fly to others that we know not of 
thus conscience should make cautious legislators of us all 
and thus the hue of b2 boosterism 
must be replaced with the sober cast of thought 
and this enterprise of great pith and moment 
be halted now before it further proceeds 
a handsome bomber yes but better 
not to be

the nations skies became more polluted in 
1988 with up to 30 million more americans now living in 
communities with unhealthy air the environmental protection agency 
said today 
new epa data shows that 101 geographical areas now violate 
standards for ozone the chief ingredient of smog and 44 have 
unhealthy carbon monoxide levels 
but in addition to identifying polluted areas under current law 
the data has major implications for the future if congress approves 
new clean air legislation this session 
any new law would be expected to use the information to 
establish new deadlines for pollution cleanup and could determine 
the severity of measures each area must adopt in order to make 
steady progress 
the newly compiled figures when applied to president bushs 
clean air proposal would bump the chicagogary ind area into 
the top category for ozone pollution allowing a 20year cleanup in 
return for adopting tough antipollution measures 
president bush previously identified new yorknorthern new 
jersey houston and los angeles as cities that would be in the 
twodecade severe category 
another 27 cities under the administration plan would be listed 
in the serious ozone category and have 10 years to clear their 
air while undertaking similar measures a list compiled by the 
associated press on july 19 using slightly older data identified 
19 cities in the serious category 
the most polluted areas for carbon monoxide under the bush 
bill would be new yorknorthern new jersey steubenville 
ohioweirton wva winnebago county wis los angeles and 
spokane wash they would have a 10year cleanup period during 
which a change in motor vehicle fuels and tighter vehicle emissions 
standards would be used to improve air quality another 39 areas 
would be under a lesser category in a twotiered system and be 
expected to meet the standards in five years through the vehicle 
emission reductions 
the epa blamed the hot dry summer of 1988 for pushing the 
number of ozone violators past the century mark an increase of 37 
smoggy areas from a year ago not a single geographical area 
improved air quality enough to cross the line from violation to 
compliance 
the worsening situation for ozone was tempered somewhat by a net 
decrease in areas failing to comply with the carbon monoxide 
standard epa officials credited tighter motor vehicle standards 
established under the 12yearold current law for the improvement 
the 44 areas in violation represent a decrease of eight 
following the deletion of 12 noncompliance areas and the addition 
of four 
but it is the combined impact of both pollutants that 
demonstrates how the air pollution problem is getting worse 
according to epa the total number of americans living where one 
or both pollutants exceed allowable limits has increased from 
nearly 80 million a year ago to a figure as high as 110 million 
the precise figure is unknown because the groupings of some 
geographical areas for counting purposes have been changed over the 
past year 
this sharp increase in the number of areas not yet meeting the 
ozone standard is dramatic proof of the pressing need for a new 
clean air bill said epa administrator william k reilly the 
problem is immense we must address it now 
reilly said the legislation proposed by the bush administration 
offers the best chance of cleaning the nations air but 
environmental groups and their congressional backers have roundly 
criticized the bill and are supporting alternative legislation 
ozone is a gas formed through chemical reactions stimulated by 
sunlight and temperature components of ozone are emitted from 
motor vehicles chemical manufacturing dry cleaners paint shops 
and solvents ailments associated with the gas include inflammation 
of the lungs impaired breathing coughing chest pain nausea and 
throat irritation longterm effects include permanent damage to 
lung tissues and impaired breathing capacity 
carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless poisonous gas produced 
by the incomplete burning of carbon in fuels with twothirds of 
the emissions coming from motor vehicles 
when inhaled carbon monoxide disrupts the delivery of oxygen to 
the bodys organs and tissues and is especially dangerous to those 
with heart disease the gas also impairs exercise capacity visual 
perception manual dexterity learning ability and performance of 
complex tasks in healthy individuals 
under the bush legislation in addition to the four areas in the 
severe ozone category and the 27 listed as serious 38 
would be classified as moderate and 32 as marginal

some people are trying to prove they can do 
the right thing when it comes to improving ethnic relations 
an italian family had dinner at a black familys apartment to 
kick off a program intended to improve relations among ethnic 
groups and the welcome was as warm as the hot summer day 
i was going to make italian food but when i found out the 
family was italian i knew i could never compete with an italian 
housewife said kim baez a black single mother of two who opened 
up her east harlem apartment to the ferraro family from the borough 
of brooklyn 
joining the families were reporters and five television crews 
including one from west germany who jammed the small apartment 
wednesday the summers hottest day so far at 96 degrees 
the next time without any tv lights you come to our house 
said giuseppe ferraro after mrs baez recited her menu of pork 
chops rice beans and salad for the umpteenth time for the cameras 
their dinner launched the citywide ethnic exchange program 
which is sponsored by the national ethnic coalition of 
organizations an umbrella group for 66 organizations the group 
provides the food and transportation 
the dinner program started with the ferraros and the baezes in 
part to help counteract negative publicity about italianblack 
relations said william fugazy a limousine company owner and one 
of the programs founders 
this could be big i dont mean a big lovein but this could 
be do the right thing our way he said 
in the current movie do the right thing a riot breaks out 
at a pizza parlor in brooklyn after a dispute between black patrons 
and the italians who own the business 
the movie was partly inspired by the 1986 confrontation in the 
new york city neighborhood of howard beach where three black men 
who went into a pizza parlor were chased and beaten by a group of 
white teenagers one of the black men was hit by a car and died 
to prepare for the dinner and clean her home mrs baez took the 
day off from her job as a bookkeeper in the afternoon she picked 
up her two children sari 9 and gabriel 11 who were at camp 
whatever comes out of this is good shes divorced and maybe 
she needs us maybe we can help her im proud to be italian but i 
love everybody said ferraro who emigrated from italy with his 
wife maria in 1969 
they have four sons and ferraro owns a homeimprovement business 
at first the children didnt take too well to the media when 
someone shoved a microphone at gabriel minutes after he walked 
through the door and asked how he liked the ferraros he said i 
havent even met them yet 
but an hour later sari and roberto ferraro 12 were taking 
turns fanning a sweating cameraman while gabriel showed off his 
five turtles and two newts to marco ferraro 10 
when i was in my school they used to have fights because some 
kids were white and some kids were black said sari its 
stupid you could be friends with white people if youre black 
roberto looked at sari and said me and her made good friends 
already

the antarctic ozone hole apparently caused 
record low ozone levels over southern australia in 1987 said 
scientists who suggested that the hole may raise skin cancer risk 
in the globes southern latitudes 
the work is the first detailed study that links the antarctic 
hole to observed ozone declines in the southern hemispheres 
midlatitudes where many people live scientists said 
the study concludes that record low ozone levels over southern 
australia and new zealand were caused mainly by the arrival of 
ozonepoor air from the antarctic hole 
southern south america and the southern tip of africa also may 
be vulnerable said study coauthor r alan plumb 
a layer of ozone a form of oxygen high in the atmosphere 
shields earth from ultraviolet rays in sunlight that cause skin 
cancer reductions in ozone let more rays through and can boost 
skin cancer rates 
the antarctic ozone hole which appears for a limited time every 
year is an area in which up to 50 percent of ozone disappears 
plumb said that while he regards the declines observed over 
australia and new zealand as relatively small they could become 
more hazardous 
but margaret kripke an immunologist who studies skin cancer 
said the increase in ultravolet rays implied by the ozone 
observations is enormous 
such increases could raise the risk of skin cancer but it is 
difficult to say by how much said kripke chairman of the 
immunology department at md anderson cancer center of the 
university of texas 
protection of the worldwide ozone shield has become a focus of 
international concern that extends beyond the antarctic ozone hole 
last year for example scientists announced evidence that ozone 
had declined about 23 percent since 1969 over a region that 
includes most of the united states 
in may delegates from 81 countries at a un conference pledged 
to stop producing and using chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons 
which destroy ozone by the year 2000 
the new study was conducted by plumb of the massachusetts 
institute of technology paul newman of the universities space 
research association and a visiting scientist at the national 
aeronautics and space administration goddard space flight center in 
greenbelt md and researchers from australia and new zealand 
it appears today in the british journal nature 
it makes a convincing case to me commented william mankin 
of the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
the antarctic ozone hole was unusual in 1987 the study said 
ozone levels reached record lows in october and november and the 
funnelshaped wind pattern that sustained the hole disintegrated in 
early december rather than november 
with the disintegration of the wind pattern each year streams 
of polar air are ripped away and migrate north the researchers 
said 
they concluded that the arrival of such ozonepoor air was the 
chief factor in producing record low ozone levels over southern 
australia and new zealand in december 1987 
the levels reported over the australian cities melbourne and 
perth for much of the month were the lowest december readings since 
measurements began in 1979 
the melbourne readings averaged about 7 percent below normal for 
the month which theoretically could boost the dose of ultraviolet 
rays at the earths surface by 14 percent plumb said 
newman said australians are typically on the beaches in 
december the start of summer in the southern hemisphere as a 
result low ozone readings during that month are particularly 
worrisome 
for the most common skin cancers which develop only after 
decades of exposure to ultraviolet rays a single episode of ozone 
reduction may not have much effect said kripke 
but reductions would pose a hazard if they continue for another 
decade or so she said 
some recent studies suggest that the risk of the deadliest skin 
cancer melanoma may be increased by a single exposure to excess 
ultraviolet rays kripke noted but too little is known about the 
causes of melanoma to gauge the risk of a single summers exposure 
she said

a white house official responding to 
complaints that the bush administration is handing out plum 
ambassadorial assignments as political payoffs says only onethird 
of the presidents embassy appointments are political 
although bushs list of nominees contains the names of several 
people who gave sixfigure contributions to republicans in the last 
election they were chosen on the basis of their qualifications 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said wednesday 
cooper said secretary of state james a baker iii is using a 
formula to ensure that 67 percent of the appointments are career 
government officers and 33 percent are political appointees 
a greater percentage of political appointees exists because some 
now serving are carryovers from the reagan administration when the 
ratio was 60 percent career officers to 40 percent political 
appointees cooper said 
some bush appointments have raised a firestorm of criticism in 
senate foreign relations committee confirmation hearings where 
some democrats have complained that the appointees lack sufficient 
qualifications beyond their financial and political connections 
at least six of the people bush appointed to ambassadorships 
gave 100000 or more to the republican national committee

families with working mothers are spending 14 
billion a year on child care an expense that costs women in 
poverty more than onefifth of their income the census bureau says 
of the 58 million women who reported making regular payments 
for child care the average weekly cost was 4520 the bureau said 
wednesday that amounted to about 6 percent of their income in 1986 
when the study was conducted 
while women living in poverty reported spending 32 a week for 
child care that amounted to 22 percent of their incomes according 
to the report 
women with incomes over 3750 a month paid 58 a week for care 
4 percent of their income 
the bureaus figures are to be published later this year as part 
of a detailed analysis of child care arrangements across the 
country preliminary material was released wednesday for use by 
congressional subcommittees debating legislation aimed at helping 
families which need child care 
testimony presented to congress has estimated child care costs 
as ranging from about 2500 annually to 6000 in large cities 
the 4520 weekly average calculated in the study would amount to 
2305 per year

workers at nissans only us plant today 
wrapped up a vote to decide whether it will become the first fully 
owned japanese auto plant organized by the united auto workers 
the vote for 2400 of the plants 3100 workers followed an 
18month campaign and was the first on union representation since 
production began in 1983 labor observers said the election was 
crucial to the uaws future in organizing the other two japanese 
auto plants in the united states 
i think weve got an excellent shot at it weve done our 
homework and weve provided people with the truth said gary 
grissham a 33yearold production technician who voted for the uaw 
the company of course has done everything they could to keep 
us out but the unions already in the plant its just a matter of 
getting us recognized he said 
but chris shelton a quality inspector who has been with nissan 
for 6 years said most of his coworkers saw no need for union 
representation 
i think the uaw is going to be defeated soundly he said 
after voting to keep the plant nonunion if there are so many 
people happy with the plant howre they going to get any votes 
or least the number they need 
voting began wednesday and was to conclude early today the 
results were to be released by the national labor relations board 
labor observers characterized the nissan vote as pivotal for the 
uaw 
the votes important because the uaw remains one of the 
strongest if not the strongest labor unions in the united 
states because it has complete coverage of gm ford and chrysler 
and these new japanese transplants the unorganized ones 
represent a threat to that power base said harry katz a labor 
relations professor at cornell university in ithaca ny

management at nissan motor manufacturing usa plant about 30 
miles southeast of nashville maintained a lowprofile public 
stance in the final weeks of the campaign refusing to discuss the 
election with the media but it matched the union blow for blow in 
talking to the workers 
while the uaw ran newspaper and radio ads handed out leaflets 
and went doortodoor to meet employees the company aired videos 
on inplant televisions and held numerous rallies including a 
lastminute production tuesday that shut down the assembly line for 
more than an hour 
nissan focused on benefits it already offers such as a 
reducedrate car leasing program and a 401k retirement plan as 
well as on a team concept in which workers rotate jobs as often as 
every two hours 
union representatives have said nissans workers make about 
7900 less a year in pay and benefits than their counterparts at 
ford motor co 
nissan has produced more than 1 million light pickup trucks and 
sentra cars since it opened the 760 million plant in june 1983 
and has the capacity to build 265000 vehicles a year a third 
model is expected to be added in 1992 
the union which forced the vote by gathering petition 
signatures from 33 percent of the nissan production workers made 
safety the key issue of its campaign claiming the plants high 
production pace has caused injuries to an estimated 18 percent of 
its workers 
the uaw said it doesnt know the exact percentage because the 
company has refused to release injury logs in violation of state 
law nissan has said such an action would violate employee 
confidentiality rights and its appealing a state order 
reflecting an overall decline in union strength uaw membership 
has fallen from more than 15 million in the late 1970s to about 1 
million today hopes of stopping the decline rest largely with the 
plants operated by japanese automakers 
the union represents workers in three joint japaneseamerican 
auto plants mazda motor manufacturing corp which also makes 
fords at flat rock mich diamondstar motors corp which makes 
chrysler and mitsubishi models near bloomington ill and new 
united motor manufacturing inc which makes general motors and 
toyota models at fremont calif 
until the nissan vote the uaw had not held representation votes 
at any of the three major unaffiliated japanese plants in the 
united states including the toyota plant at georgetown ky and 
hondas plant at marysville ohio an effort to organize the honda 
plant three years ago was discarded before a vote because of lack 
of support

with the strength of his 
arms and the power of his will a paraplegic completed a weeklong 
ascent of 3200foot el capitan and said his climb proves the 
disabled can accomplish great feats 
mark wellman accompanied by his friend mike corbett reached 
the summit at wednesday afternoon seven days and four hours after 
they left the yosemite valley floor 
a nationwide television audience saw them at the mountaintop 
and later the us senate passed a resolution commending them for 
their extraordinary feat of bravery and stoutheartedness 
sen bob dole rkan disabled himself with a partially 
paralyzed right arm offered the resolution 
my whole thing in life is finding another way to do it 
whether that be skiing kayaking or whatever said wellman a 
29yearold park ranger at a news conference before dozens of 
reporters friends and fellow workers 
wellman said he performed the climb for personal achievement 
not for the disabled but he said he hoped it would prove that 
people need not be stopped by their physical disabilities 
go out and do it said wellman who wore the same boots he 
was wearing in 1982 when he fell 50 feet during a climb of 
13700foot gables peak south of yosemite he was left paralyzed 
from the waist down 
he said his next adventure will be crosscountry skiing using a 
dog to pull him while he poles with his arms 
wellman became the first paraplegic to conquer el capitan the 
vertical trek took an estimated 7000 pullups each advancing him 
only six inches he had trained six months for the ascent making 
35 practice climbs on other sheer rocks and training with weights 
to climb el capitan wellman and corbett 35 used modified cave 
exploration equipment that allowed wellman to pull himself up the 
face of the cliff using a tbar device and ropes set by corbett 
wellman and corbett toted 200 pounds of food and gear including 
hammocks that were suspended from hooks placed into the rock as 
they slept 
as they reached the summit corbett carried wellman on his back 
to a shady spot under a pine tree the climbers were greeted by 
their girlfriends cheering friends and reporters 
soon they were sipping champagne and gulping ice water 
on the summit set against a backdrop of views that included 
towering peaks of the sierra nevada and half dome they were almost 
nonchalant 
we didnt really have any scary moments doing this said 
wellman 
their biggest problem was the wind which wellman said gusted 
from 11 am to 8 pm each day sometimes blowing them 10 feet out 
from the cliff 
he said the heat was less of a problem but temperatures 
occasionally soared to more than 100 degrees on the face of the 
cliff 
at the peak he accepted a signed photograph of yosemite from 
corbett who wrote it was an unbelievable experience corbett 
has scaled el capitan 42 times more than any other climber 
wellman rode down from the mountain on a horse talking with a 
fellow ranger about everything except the climb 
corbett walked out briskly leaving other hikers in his dust 
he had something else on his mind 
his family saw him in the televised coverage of the climb it 
was the first time they had seen him in years 
they were to be reunited this weekend with several family 
members flying in from houston 
the anticipation distracted him from the climbing routine he 
said he was unable to sleep early monday because of the memories 
corbetts girlfriend gwen schneider said corbett last talked 
to his family in 1981 after his parents were divorced 
ive got to fill my family in on a lot of things that have 
happened in the last 10 years of my life corbett said

an unexpected thrill 
awaited tourists who visited a sunny yosemite meadow surrounded by 
soaring granite cliffs with el capitan the grandest among them 
thanks to telescopes set up by a pair of publicspirited amateur 
astronomers hundreds of people on wednesday got closeup views of 
paraplegic mark wellman as he neared the finish of his historic 
ascent to become the first paraplegic to climb one of the toughest 
challenges climbers face 
five telescopes and a powerful pair of field glasses all 
mounted on tripods were set up in the meadow and trained on 
wellman and his climbing companion mike corbett 
struggling to the top nearly a mile from the people in the 
meadow the climbers were practically invisible to the naked eye 
but seemed perhaps 50 yards away when viewed through a 10inch 
telescope built by jim baumgardt an electronics worker from 
burlingame calif 
that is neat that is really neat said alisa hunter of 
charlotte nc after watching wellman and corbett 
another spectator waiting for a telescope to become available 
stared up at the imposing monolith 3200 feet above the floor of 
yosemite valley and said softly oh my goodness 
up to 20 people at a time stood in lines waiting for a chance to 
gaze at the two men hanging from ropes and struggling upward 
he was hanging on the rock and all of a sudden slipped off 
said wideeyed 11yearold tony beckett of bakersfield calif 
after watching one of the climbershe was swinging back and 
forth 
after peering through the telescope park concession worker 
casey johnson called the climb pretty amazing 
his companion leena conway said they and other coworkers of 
wellman a park ranger are really proud that hes doing that 
the idea to set up their stargazing equipment for the public 
occurred tuesday night to baumgardt and william phelps vice 
president of the peninsula astronomical societys vice president 
who lives in palo alto 
i saw it on tv last night and thought i have the equipment 
this is really neat and id like to see it baumgardt said

villagers scampered on rooftops and 
flash floods slammed cars against buildings as heavy rains soaked 
the southern coast killing dozens of people and leaving 50000 
homeless officials said today 
the national disaster center in seoul reported 55 confirmed 
deaths and 48 people missing during three days of torrential rains 
but said communcations to remote areas were cut off and predicted 
the official death toll would rise 
newspapers and television stations reported at least 140 people 
either dead or missing they estimated the total property damage at 
70 million 
some villages drenched with 176 inches of rain over three 
days were virtually submerged and television footage showed only 
the tops of tile roofs surrounded by water 
relief officials fear that typhoon judy with winds of about 57 
mph would add to the carnage already caused by seasonal rains the 
storm was expected to hit the southern areas today 
president roh taewoo ordered all available military helicopters 
and other equipment mobilized for rescues and flood control prime 
minister kang younghoon inspected the floodstricken areas today 
the hardesthit area was south cholla where 34 people were

the failure of hightech medicine to save some 
chernobyl radiation victims is a reminder of doctors limited 
ability to cope with nuclear disasters a us physician says 
in a report in todays new england journal of medicine us and 
soviet doctors described their attempts to use transplants to 
restore victims radiationdamaged bone marrow of 13 men given 
marrow transplants only two survived 
it should be a clear lesson to everybody that no matter how 
sophisticated we get there are going to be serious limitations 
said dr robert peter gale a university of california los 
angeles physician who led a fourmember us transplant team to 
the soviet union after chernobyl 
nobody should think that doctors are going to bail them out of 
any misuse of nuclear devices he said 
the report was written by gale dr alexandr baranov of clinical 
hospital 6 in moscow and 15 other physicians who took part in 
caring for chernobyl victims 
gale said he considered the publication itself to be a major 
diplomatic achievement 
a joint sovietamerican report of a soviet nuclear accident 
being published in an american journal is extraordinary he said 
in an interview this could never have happened three years ago 
at least 29 people died after an explosion and fire in 1986 at 
the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the soviet union released a 
cloud of radioactive material 
since chernobyl blood cell growth hormones have become 
available and gale has used them to treat nuclear mishaps in 
brazil and el salvador 
experience gained in the combination of growth hormones and 
marrow transplants gives us a very sensible strategy for treating 
victims of nuclear accidents gale said 
high doses of radiation destroy tissue in the bone marrow that 
makes new blood cells this leaves victims at high risk of 
infection and other medical problems 
gale said that after the chernobyl accident doctors treated 499 
people and 202 of them had serious radiation injuries thirteen 
people exposed to total body doses ranging from 560 to 1340 rads 
of radiation were given bone marrow transplants in an effort to 
restore their bodies ability to make blood cells 
a rad is a measurement of radiation gale said that those with 
exposures below 200 rads can be treated with transfusions and 
antibiotics while people with exposures between 200 and 800 rads 
can probably be saved with blood cell growth factors 
at higher radiation levels he said you wont have enough 
remaining bone marrow cells to stimulate with these factors and 
you are going to have to consider transplantation pretty much in 
the way we did after chernobyl 
the two who survived after the bone marrow operations found that 
their bodies eventually rejected the transplanted tissue gale said 
this shows that transplants can keep people alive until their own 
bone marrow recovers 
most of the rest died of severe burns and other damage caused by 
radiation 
i am disappointed because we invested such a huge amount in 
these cases said gale you want everyone to live but this is 
not designed to rescue people dying of nonbone marrow failure 
gale has since used blood cell growth factors on people who came 
in contact with radioactive cesium 137 that was removed from a 
partly demolished cancer treatment center in brazil and on people 
accidentally exposed to cobalt 60 at a sterilization plant in el 
salvador 
these natural hormones which are produced through gene 
splicing can prompt the remaining bone marrow cells to work 
harder producing more blood cells 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal drs christine k 
cassel of the university of chicago and jennifer leaning of harvard 
said the latest work adds greatly to our knowledge of the 
management of acute radiation injury

felix s bloch the us diplomat suspected of 
spying could remain free for a long time while fbi agents conduct 
a daunting hunt to identify specific secrets he may have turned 
over to the soviets 
the specific evidence required by the espionage act could take a 
long time to find if its found at all government sources said 
wednesday night speaking on condition of anonymity 
at the same time fbi agents continue to search well out of 
the public eye for circumstantial evidence that might persuade 
bloch to confess if he is a spy 
the bloch case with reporters and television cameras trailing 
the 54yearold diplomat through the streets may look unusual to 
the public 
but the unusual element is the publicity at this stage 
otherwise its like most spy investigations 
actually its not uncommon at all for targets to roam free 
while agents sweat bullets and painstakingly comb secret 
documents bank records tax returns airline tickets and hotel 
receipts said former fbi spy hunter james nolan in an interview 
bloch was put on paid leave by the state department on june 22 
the same day the fbi first tried to interview him state department 
security officers had talked with him earlier 
his diplomatic passport was lifted but his travel was not 
restricted he was put under obvious 24hour fbi surveillance 
designed to discourage him from flight 
last friday a leaked news report brought his situation to 
public attention 
nolan who disclaimed any knowledge of blochs case said what 
the public is seeing now is identical to what has gone on without 
publicity in countless earlier spy investigations other suspects 
have walked free for weeks or longer after making a confession 
before there was an arrest 
nolan who retired in 1988 from his post as ambassador in charge 
of the state departments office of foreign missions spent 20 
years catching spies for the fbi rising to deputy chief of the 
bureaus intelligence division 
some observers have suggested the unusual publicity in blochs 
case is designed to pressure him into a confession but nolan said 
its a lot easier to make an arrest outside the glare of 
publicity 
after the first leak the state department confirmed the fbi was 
investigating bloch for illegal activities involving agents 
of a foreign intelligence service 
but the justice department as usual has said nothing and is 
reported to be upset that state said so much 
a few details of the governments evidence have leaked from 
unnamed sources there is a videotape of bloch passing a mystery 
briefcase to a soviet agent in paris and the same agent later was 
monitored giving bloch what sounded like a telephone warning that 
he was under suspicion 
if the government actually knows that much why hasnt it 
arrested bloch 
nolan said us espionage law requires proof that national 
security information was given to a foreign power with intent to 
harm the national defense 
nolan said courts would accept any classified document or data 
as a violation but the government has to show specifically at least 
one item that was turned over 
government sources say the government does not know what was in 
the briefcase bloch handed over they say if the material was 
classified it would be easy to prove intent to harm because bloch 
like all diplomats has been trained that the classification system 
is designed to protect national security 
even spies who confess arent necessarily arrested right away 
why 
because ultimately a suspects attorney may try to have the 
confession thrown out so agents must prove it will stand up in 
court 
hes told you hes an agent and hes been paid nolan said 
you have to go find a specific classified document he turned over 
and someone in the government who will testify in court that it is 
classified 
and when theres merely a suspicious contact with a foreign 
agent but no confession 
youve got an even longer case nolan said 
most spies get paid he said if they dont confess you 
go through their bank accounts trying to find every honest dollar 
they made and then through their expenditures and their tax 
returns trying to prove that their net worth shows theyve been 
making 500000 or 50000 in unaccounted for income 
that takes an awful long time 
the goal in this effort is to build to a facetoface interview 
where you can lever the suspect into a confession nolan said 
in a related development blochs daughter told the new york 
post in an interview in todays editions that ronald lauder begged 
her father to stay on at his post at the us embassy in austria 
when bloch was planning to leave three years ago 
in 1986 my father was ready to leave austria he had already 
been in vienna six years but lauder wanted my father to stay 
on andrea bloch 26 who works at an art gallery told the post 
and now lauder is using my father to try to promote his candidacy 
for mayor and it kills me 
lauder heir to the estee lauder cosmetics fortune and a 
republican mayoral candidate was appointed us ambassador to 
austria in 1986 
bloch served under lauder in vienna from 1980 to 1987 lauder 
says he fired bloch for insubordination the foreign service says 
it was time for bloch to come back to washington anyway 
a lauder spokesman nelson warfield called miss blochs 
assertion that lauder begged bloch to stay ludicrous

a womans chance of having a caesarean section 
depends more on the size of her bank account than on the difficulty 
of her labor a report today shows 
many physicians believe caesareans are far too widely used and 
the doctor who directed the research said one reason wealthy women 
receive them most often may be because of doctors fear of lawsuits 
the surgical form of birth is intended for cases where vaginal 
birth is difficult or hazardous to the baby but over the past two 
decades the number of caesareans has quadrupled making it the 
most common operation in the united states 
the most surprising thing is that one expects poor people to 
have many more health problems than rich people said dr jeffrey 
b gould they have more low birth weight infants and more 
neonatal mortality the notion that rich people are having more 
caesarean sections than poor people is a topsyturvy finding 
gould directed the research which was based on the birth 
certificates of 245854 infants born in los angeles county in 1982 
and 1983 it was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
physicians typically receive bigger fees for caesareans than for 
vaginal births but gould said the very simplistic reason that 
the rich are rich and the doctors want to make money is a minor 
part of the picture 
instead the wealthy may be more likely to demand or receive 
caesareans if minor problems arise because their doctors fear 
these patients will take them to court if the baby is less than 
perfect when born vaginally 
in contrast he said poor people are more likely to give birth 
at big teaching hospitals where they are cared for by resident 
physicians these young doctors are closely supervised and often 
are determined to limit caesareans to cases in which they are truly 
necessary 
dr benjamin sachs of bostons beth israel hospital said a 
womans chances of having a vaginal delivery are in part dependent 
on how her obstetrical care is provided 
he noted that a wealthy woman is more likely to have a private 
physician who bounces back and forth between his office and the 
labor room in teaching hospitals and health maintenance 
organizations one doctor is typically assigned full time to labor 
and delivery so whether she delivers or not there is no 
pressure 
sachs said that because their doctors use caesareans more 
sparingly poor women may be getting better care than affluent 
women 
goulds study compared caesarean rates based on the income of 
the neighborhoods where women lived it found that 23 percent of 
pregnant women from areas where family incomes averaged more than 
30000 received caesareans compared with 13 percent of those who 
came from places where families made less than 11000 
the differences could not be explained by the womens race 
ethnic background age number of previous births or the weight of 
their babies 
its a very striking difference said gould it occurs in 
all ethnic groups 
whites were most apt to have caesareans and mexicanamericans 
were the least likely but the caesarean rate rose steadily with 
increasing income in all racial and ethnic groups 
for instance 16 percent of black women from areas with income 
below 11000 had caesareans compared with 26 percent of blacks 
from neighborboods above 30000

worldwide economic trend he said 
especially a slowdown in the us economy is becoming 
obvious nomura said citing the federal reserve boards federal 
funds rate cut to 85 percent 
in currency dealings the dollars decline in tokyo followed a 
plunge on overseas markets overnight lower us interest rates 
make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors

the federal aviation administration is being 
asked to investigate whether scrap parts were used in the engine of 
the united airlines dc10 that crashed last week 
the plane crashlanded at sioux city iowa killing 111 people 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of a house energy and 
commerce subcommittee that oversees such investigations asked the 
faa on wednesday to look into the possibility that general electric 
co used scrap parts purchased from kelly air force base in san 
antonio 
ge said the parts of the dc10 engine being investigated could 
not have come from the kelly scrap yard ge manufactures the tf39 
engine that powers the air forces c5a as well as the similarly 
designed cf6 engine that powers the commercial dc10 and the 
boeing 747 
the air force routinely throws away engine blades and turbine 
nozzles that may be good repairable or unusable and dingell 
explained that this cornucopia of blades and parts were all going 
into the disposal or scrap yard at kelly air force base 
investigators for the general accounting office found as early 
as november 1986 that ge and other contractors purchased 
condemned air force tf39 engine parts because they were identical 
to commercial cf6 engine parts used to power the dc10 dingell 
said 
dingells letter to new faa administrator james b busey iv was 
first reported on by cbs news and later was made available by an 
aide it asked for a response by aug 4 
dingell noted that he had first warned former faa administrator 
donald engen in 1986 that scrapped parts might be used in new 
engines 
ge spokesman david lane said in cincinnati the part of the 
cf6 engine being investigated including the fan section does 
not employ tf39 parts those parts are totally different and are 
not compatible 
the fan section disintegrated and investigators believe 
shrapnellike debris severed hydraulic lines making the dc10 
almost impossible to control 
ted lopatkiewicz spokesman for the national transportation 
safety board said the investigation is not focusing on any one 
area 
were investigating this in a number of areas and we will be 
analyzing all the wreckage very thoroughly we are trying to 
recover as much of the engine as we can and we will analyze the 
wreckage of that engine said lopatkiewicz 
federal investigators have removed the engine from the tail 
section of the plane and plan to take it to the ge plant near 
cincinnati where it was built to try to determine why uniteds 
fan section disintegrated 
ntsb investigator jack young arrived at the ge plant in 
evendale ohio on wednesday to review ges manufacturing and 
maintenance records for the rear engine which was built in 1972 
all three of the engines on the dc10 that crashed in iowa were 
built at the plant 
ge manufactured the engine from 1971 to 1981 and the engine 
established a record of reliability during 17 million flight hours 
in commercial service said ge spokesman dwight weber

the chief defendant in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial took the stand more than five years after he was 
charged and testified he never sexually abused children at the 
school 
never raymond buckey responded adamantly wednesday as his 
attorney asked whether he had ever sexually molested the toddlers 
who attended the nowdefunct manhattan beach school 
buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 are 
charged with 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of 
conspiracy 
now in its 27th month the trial is the nations longestrunning 
trial the case has been in the court system for five years 
in a soft voice buckey repeatedly answered no when his 
attorney asked if he had exposed himself to children engaged in 
oral copulation with children threatened children with harm 
killed animals caused children to bleed or played naked games 
at the preschool 
buckey said that one child who accused him of molesting her had 
attended the nursery school before he ever worked there 
the preliminary hearing is the first time i ever saw her in 
my life he testified 
outside court buckey told reporters im glad to finally be 
up there telling my side of the story 
he said he wasnt worried about being crossexamined by the 
prosecutor 
i have the truth behind me he said 
asked why small children would tell of molestations if they 
never occurred buckey said i think adults have had a lot of 
influence on these children thats where its coming from 
buckeys lawyer danny davis predicted his client would spend a 
month on the witness stand fighting the charges which kept him in 
jail for five years until he was released on 15 million bail last 
february buckey was to resume his testimony today 
five of the original defendants had charges against them 
dismissed after a twoyear preliminary hearing leaving buckey and 
his mother to face trial 
the prosecution called 61 witnesses including nine children who 
said they were raped sodomized or forced into oral copulation 
children told bizarre tales of being forced to play games in the 
nude and of being sexually abused they also said animals were 
tortured to terrify them into compliance 
buckey tanned and clad in a dark blue sport jacket and khaki 
slacks told jurors he worked as an aide to teachers at the 
preschool from 1981 until the end of summer 1983 when it was first 
alleged that he had molested children 
he was arrested in august 1983 and released when charges were 
dropped he was rearrested march 22 1984 
on wednesday he denied ever touching a childs genitals except 
with a washcloth when he helped them clean up after bathroom 
accidents buckey said he didnt produce child pornography and has 
never seen any he also denied using animals to scare children 
the defense in its ninth month of presentation has featured 
testimony from former teachers and students from the preschool 
they said they never saw children molested 
mrs buckey has said she never did anything improper and 
believed her son was innocent 
superior court judge william pounders pounders said recently he 
saw no end to the trial before 1990 
he has voiced concerns about the toll the case has taken on 
jurors and on the possibility of a mistrial if more jurors are 
excused the trial started with 12 jurors and six alternates only 
one alternate remains

syrian and christian forces waged a 
devastating artillery duel across beirut during the night killing 
28 people and wounding 80 police said four died when rockets 
crashed into a home for the elderly 
the latest casualties raised the overall casualty toll to 481 
killed and 1949 wounded in the 19week confrontation between gen 
michel aouns christian forces and syrian army gunners in beirut 
and the surrounding mountains 
it was the heaviest shelling since march 14 when 39 people were 
killed and 96 wounded 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said casualties were higher in syrianpoliced moslem 
west beirut than in the citys eastern christian sector 
voice of the homeland the most popular moslem radio station 
called on those who control the machine of steel and fire to stop 
the massacre at any cost 
the police spokesman said it was impossible to determine who 
started the bombardment he noted it was the fiercest ever 
artillery attack by aouns gunners against the syrians 
the christiansyrian confrontation began march 8 after aoun 
blockaded ports operated by moslem militias south of beirut the 
syrians and their militia allies retaliated by shelling the 
christian enclave north of the city 
shells today tore gaping holes in apartment buildings 
triggering hundreds of fires that blazed out of control because a 
power outage left the fire brigade without water 
thuds from exploding shells and the whooshing sound of rockets 
echoed around the city during an eighthour duel that subsided into 
intermittent exchanges at 330 am 
a police spokesman said shells and rockets rained on residential 
areas at the rate of 60 per minute radio stations interrupted 
programs to urge civilians to take shelter underground 
five rockets fired from east beirut scored direct hits on a 
moslem home for the elderly in west beirut killing four elderly 
people and wounding three the spokesman said 
the four major hospitals in west beirut also evacuated patients 
to underground shelters as shells and rockets crashed into almost 
every single street the spokesman said 
smoke billowed from several gutted buildings and debris and 
glass shards carpeted streets as anxious residents emerged from 
bomb shelters to inspect their property 
hundreds of cars crushed in the barrage littered west beiruts 
kantari district a middleaged woman tears in her eyes called on 
allah to punish the criminals who caused this catastrophe 
may allahs wrath fall on all the combatants they get paid to 
kill us or ruin our property she shouted watched by a syrian 
soldier manning a nearby sandbagged position 
the police spokesman said aouns gunners entrenched in the 
310squaremile christian enclave pounded syrian army positions in 
west beirut and the mountains southeast of the capital 
aouns forces the spokesman said also blasted the eastern 
bekaa valley aiming at syrian army supply routes from damascus 
syria keeps about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate but the christians contend the syrians 
betrayed the mandate by siding with the moslems in the 14yearold 
civil war and should leave 
the lebanese forces rightwing christian militia allied with 
aoun fired more than 40 rockets a minute from bm21 
multibarrelled launchers against residential districts in west 
beirut and other moslem sectors the police spokesman said 
the moslem voice of the nation said the militia gunners used 
phosphorous ammunition in rocketing west beirut to plant fire and 
death wherever they explode 
the christian voice of lebanon said damage also was extensive in 
the christian heartland especially in east beiruts ashrafiyeh 
residential district 
an ashrafiyeh resident speaking on condition he not be named 
said lebanese forces militiamen toured east beirut in cars fitted 
with loudspeakers shortly before the shelling began late wednesday 
urging people to stay underground overnight 
it was strange because at the time they advised us to rush to 
shelters there was no shelling he said without elaborating 
the escalation coincided with a statement issued in rabat the 
moroccan capital that the foreign ministers of morocco saudi 
arabia and algeria are to meet there saturday to assess their 
efforts to end the 14yearold civil war in lebanon

blood samples taken from the pilot who survived a 
crash in the bahamas show no trace of alcohol or drugs federal 
investigators said 
the blood test produced no answers to what happened to the 
alexandria va communications attorney before his singleengine 
plane ended an 800mile odyssey on autopilot with a spectacular 
watery crash july 13 
root 36 checked out of hollywoods memorial hospital monday 
after being treated for wounds left by a bullet passing through his 
midsection and arm 
verbal reports from the laboratory indicate that the alcohol 
and basic drugs are negative said andrew alston an air safety 
investigator with the national transportation safety board 
alston said wednesday that results are still unavailable on the 
small section of roots intestine that was removed during surgery 
but dr robert cohen roots surgeon said tuesday that test 
results he has seen on the specimen are not specific enough to help 
investigators 
blood tests for carbon monoxide were also negative which 
authorities said ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning for roots 
claim that he lost consciousness while piloting the plane 
the timing of the shooting is still unknown because root has 
told investigators he has no recollection of it 
roots flight from washingtons national airport to rocky mount 
nc was normal until air traffic controllers radioed him to say 
he was flying past his destination 
the pilot reported he had difficulty breathing and chest pains 
military pilots who followed his cessna 210 over the atlantic 
reported seeing the pilot slumped at the controls but said his head 
and the planes sun visor moved several times 
root has acknowledged keeping a loaded revolver in the planes 
glove compartment relatives speculated the 32caliber smith amp 
wesson may have gone off an impact but the manufacturer discounted 
that idea 
the us attorneys office is reviewing information on root 
gathered by the fbi since the shooting and crash but has refused 
public comment

federal environmental officials said 
they are closing in on who was responsible for illegally dumping 
chemical wastes in an area later developed as a mobile home park 
residents meanwhile expressed outrage wednesday night at 
federal plans to temporarily relocate them they argued for a 
better monetary aid package and a permanent relocation plan 
the chemicals believed to be cancercausing industrial 
compounds were identified in a federal report released tuesday 
government officials have since advised residents of the forest 
glen trailer park to leave their homes 
david payne an environmental protection administration 
enforcement official said authorities have identified several 
chemical companies in niagara falls and a defunct trucking company 
that may have been responsible for dumping chemicals in the 
neighborhood over 10 years beginning in the early 1970s 
payne said one of the companies under investigation is 
occidental chemical corp earlier this year a federal judge found 
occidental partly responsible for toxic contamination at nearby 
love canal which was declared a national environmental disaster 10 
years ago 
we have a list of companies and were questioning each one 
payne said wednesday were narrowing it down 
more than 90 trailer park residents met with federal officials 
wednesday night to hear a proposal for relocation aid 
the government has offered to relocate residents temporarily 
while attempts are made to get the site on a federal superfund 
priority list for cleanup officials said it could take as little 
as two months to get on the superfund list 
many spoke against the governments plan 
why cant you declare an emergency like they did in love canal 
and move us out immediately asked resident robert barclay 
its too long to wait its too much of a disruption for the 
family you dont realize what youre putting us through said 
resident terry freirmuth 
robert salkie an epa official urged residents to make the best 
of the offer to relocate 
it is dangerous to live at forest glen salkie said 
the epa announced tuesday that chemicals in the soil and 
groundwater beneath the trailer park endangered the health of the 
51 families in the neighborhood 
barclay and others also complained about the governments 
monetary offer three months rent for those who move temporarily 
my wife and i cant afford it were on social security 
barclay said 
the federal emergency management agency also will provide food 
and utility stipends for relocating residents and in some cases pay 
for rental insurance and the cost of kenneling pets said 
spokeswoman gerald connolly 
paying mortgages on homes in the forest glen neighborhood will 
remain the responsibility of the owners he said 
officials said the amount of aid will depend on the number of 
family members a family of four would receive 637 in housing 
assistance 
payne said officials identified chemical contamination in the 
neighborhood as early as april 1987 but had trouble identifying the 
chemicals and establishing whether they were hazardous 
these arent the common chemicals he said 
the chemicals include aniline phenothiazine benzothiazole 
mercaptobenzothiazole and polyaromatic hydrocarbons

a court today convicted carl gustav 
christer pettersson a 42yearold career criminal and drug abuser 
of the 1986 murder of prime minister olof palme and sentenced him 
to life in prison 
the conviction ended one of the most closely watched trials in 
sweden and capped the countrys largest criminal investigation 
stockholm district court handed down the guilty verdict after 17 
days of deliberations and drafting of the legal judgement 
pettersson a swede was given the most severe penalty possible 
sweden has no death penalty 
the government normally commutes life terms to 20 years or 
fewer sweden has one of the worlds most lenient penal systems 
palme a fourterm prime minister and an international leader in 
social democratic politics was shot in the back outside a downtown 
stockholm movie theater while walking home unguarded with his wife 
the killer fled down a dark side steet 
the two judges who served as jurists on the eightmember panel 
voted for acquittal saying there was not enough hard evidence to 
convict pettersson for the slaying on feb 28 1986 they were 
overruled however by the six other jurors only a majority of 
jurors was needed to convict 
pettersson was also convicted of endangering the life of palmes 
wife lisbeth who was slightly injured in the shooting she was a 
key witness in the case 
lisbeth palme has without a doubt and with great certainty 
pointed out christer pettersson as the man who was at the dekorima 
shop and who was determined to be the assailant said the jurys 
written decision 
the dekorima shop is an art supply store at the intersection 
where the shooting occurred 
however michael af geijerstam one of the dissenting jurors 
told reporters after todays conviction we think that the factor 
of uncertainty is so prominent that we cant vote to convict 
the jury reached the verdict a week ago but withheld it while 
writing a detailed finding however they ordered pettersson to 
remain in custody 
pettersson was arrested last dec 17 he maintained his 
innocence during the fiveweek trial that began june 5 even before 
todays announcement petterssons lawyer said he would appeal a 
guilty verdict 
the investigation leading up to his trial was marked by 
setbacks police and security agencies were officially condemned 
for bungling the case three police chiefs and a federal justice 
minister resigned under fire 
investigators spent an estimated 1 million manhours chasing 
theories of international conspiracy no one ever claimed a reward 
worth 8 million that was offered for information leading to a 
conviction 
petterssons criminal record lists more than 60 arrests and 
includes a conviction for manslaughter in the 1970 bayonet stabbing 
of a man near the palme slaying site 
he has previously been held in courtordered psychiatric care 
and has a long history of methamphetamine and alcohol abuse 
i was a bum he told the court its actually surprising 
that anyone at all has anything positive to say about me 
i did not kill prime minister olof palme he testified he 
described himself as an admirer of palme 
police questioned pettersson in the weeks immediately after the 
shooting but released him because his alibi seemed sound 
he came under suspicion again late last year when a new team of 
investigators found holes in his original story 
mrs palme testified that she had seen pettersson standing near 
her husband immediately after the shooting 
im absolutely certain about his identity she testified 
last month other witnesses placed him near the scene or said he 
had followed the palmes down sveavagen a main avenue after the 
late movie 
however neither mrs palme nor any other witness swore to 
seeing pettersson fire the shots that killed palme and slightly 
wounded his wife 
mrs palme said she remembered petterssons face but could not 
swear that he had a gun in his hand 
the murder weapon a 357caliber magnum pistol was never found

the top military adviser to soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev says if washington deploys the b2 stealth 
bomber the kremlin would respond adequately by developing ways 
to detect the radardodging plane 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev toured the chicago board of trade 
visited a mcdonalds restaurant and spoke at a security forum 
wednesday 
he said at the luncheon forum that if the united states 
purchases a fleet of b2 stealth bombers a program generating 
bitter debate this week in congress the soviet union will 
respond adequately in order to defend our interests 
certain steps to improve our air defense system would be 
carried out he said hinting that the soviets would develop 
methods to detect and shoot down the boomerangshaped bomber 
akhromeyev urged the audience to appreciate the soviet unions 
unwillingness to lose its advantage in ground forces without 
limiting us ability to project naval power around the soviet 
periphery 
we have a legitimate right to be concerned about the huge 
power of the us navy he said noting the us monopoly on 
large aircraft carriers we are in no way attempting to disarm 
you but you should think about the fact that the time has come to 
initiate negotiations on sea power 
akhromeyev who is on a 10day visit to the united states 
testified friday before the house armed services committee about 
the future of soviet military policy 
as part of a threeday visit to chicago he spoke at the 
luncheon sponsored by the national strategy forum a local 
organization that conducts programs and research to broaden citizen 
awareness on national security issues 
i do not regard the united states as the enemy anymore 
akhromeyev told the audience but at a news conference later he 
said mistrust is still the component element of the 
environment in which the kremlin and the white house operate

cambodian prime minister hun sen met today with 
french premier michel rocard and said he hopes an international 
conference on his wartorn nation goes ahead as planned officials 
said 
leaving the hourlong meeting hun sen told reporters that the 
four cambodian factions were seeking a compromise in a dispute over 
who should represent cambodia at the nearly 20nation conference 
which starts sunday 
hun sen had been expected to resume talks today with the leaders 
of the threepart cambodian resistance however a foreign ministry 
spokesman said lowerranking officials from the four factions would 
meet today instead 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping 
with department practice said the talks among the leaders could 
start again friday 
hun sen is demanding that cambodia be represented at the 
international conference by two delegations his 
vietnameseinstalled government and the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition 
but prince norodom sihanouk the resistance leader rejects 
this he wants cambodia to be represented by one delegation that 
includes the government and guerrilla factions a proposal 
rejected by hun sen 
the conference will include the participation of the five 
permanent members of the un security council the united states 
soviet union china britain and france also participating will be 
canada india japan and the sixnation association of southeast 
asian nations 
we refuse to let the world see that we are two cambodias 
sihanouk said wednesday we let france know that in such a case 
we will not attend the conferenceand the results of the 
conference will not be valid 
the role of the khmer rouge the strongest of the three 
resistance factions is at the heart of the dispute 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to topple the khmer 
rouge which was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of people in a more than threeyear reign of terror 
the disagreement between the factions extends to how cambodias 
representatives should be seated at the huge rectangular table 
around which foreign ministers will meet 
hun sen suggested today that four seats one for each faction 
might represent a compromise solution sihanouk told reporters 
wednesday he would propose four seats a plan originally outlined 
by france 
the ministry is very active in the search for a compromise 
solution over the khmer representation at the international 
conference on cambodia the foreign ministry spokesman said 
progress has already been made and the talks should be able to 
resume during the day friday 
both hun sen and sihanouk have held out the possibility that 
cambodia would not be represented something all concerned want to 
avoid 
hun sen expressed his wish to see the international conference 
on cambodia take place said an aide to rocard briefing 
reporters on the meeting on condition of anonymity 
hun sen said he had a good conversation with rocard and 
described the meeting as important the meeting was the first 
between hun sen and the head of a western government 
france recognizes neither the vietnameseinstalled government of 
hun sen nor the exile coalition government of democratic kampuchea 
over which sihanouk is president 
most nations recognize the guerrilla coalition which holds 
cambodias seat at the united nations

sri lanka today ruled out a military 
confrontation with india easing fears of more bloodshed as the 
deadline for the demanded withdrawal of indian peacekeeping troops 
approaches 
we are not going to fight india we know our limitations 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne told reporters 
also today news reports said indian troops clashed once again 
with ethnic tamil rebels whom the indians were sent to disarm two 
years ago one report said 15 civilians were killed in the cross 
fire 
fears of clashes between sri lankan and indian soldiers in 
northeastern sri lanka mounted after india refused to pull out its 
troops by saturday the deadline set by president ranasinghe 
premadasa 
the president had vowed to take necessary steps if the 
estimated 45000 indian soldiers did not leave by then 
wijeratne said he and premadasa were conducting intensive 
personal negotiations with indian leaders to resolve the 
withdrawal issue 
the foreign minister said india should accept premadasa as the 
commanderinchief of all forces in sri lanka and it should stop 
fighting the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest and most 
militant tamil rebel group seeking a separate nation in the 
northeast 
indian forces in sri lanka now operate under an indian commander 
asked what sri lanka would do if india rejected sri lankas 
demands wijeratne said the president will take a course of 
action which he will spell out after the 29th but we still feel we 
can resolve this problem 
india sent troops to sri lanka an island off its southern 
coast to disarm the rebels under the terms of a peace accord 
signed july 29 1987 
a tamil newspaper published in jaffna 185 miles north of 
colombo said at least 15 tamil civilians were killed in cross fire 
wednesday between the rebels and indian soldiers at the northern 
village of point pedro 
in new delhi india a foreign ministry official said the 
soldiers shot and killed nine rebels however the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity made no mention of civilian 
casualties 
point pedro is a rebel stronghold 
the indian troops initially were deployed to supervise the 1987 
peace accord which promised limited autonomy to the minority 
tamils in exchange for an arms surrender by the militant groups 
while most militias abided by the accord the dominant tamil 
tigers backed out and began attacking indian soldiers about 1000 
troops have been killed 
premadasa made his demand on june 1 after the tigers opened 
peace talks with his government but india refused to comply 
saying a premature withdrawal could lead to even more bloodshed 
subsequent requests by premadasa and refusals by indias prime 
minister rajiv gandhi led to a diplomatic impasse and fears about 
the safety of the indians civilians as well as soldiers on the 
island 
wijeratne said the withdrawal issue was being used by 
antigovernment sinhalese extremists to whip up venom against 
india 
about 800 relatives of indian diplomats flew home this week for 
what was described by embassy officials as a routine vacation 
we cannot ensure security to every single indian home but we 
have secured sensitive areas wijeratne said 
the indian presence is resented by sinhalese extremists who say 
it compromises the countrys sovereignty they have used this issue 
to launch a violent antigovernment and antiindian campaign

the bush administration is hitting the road to 
seek consensus on a national energy strategy including how to curb 
us dependence on imported oil and still protect the environment 
energy secretary james watkins outlined plans wednesday for a 
series of hearings in five cities to quiz energy industry 
representatives environmentalists and others on what focus a 
national energy policy should take 
president bush signed legislation wednesday ending price 
controls on natural gas he made it clear that whatever 
recommendations are made for a national energy policy the 
department will rely heavily on market forces and not controls 
imposed from washington 
a preliminary outline for an energy strategy is to be completed 
next spring with final recommendations to be on bushs desk by the 
end of 1990 
the document and recommendations will serve as a blueprint for 
energy policy and program decisions set our pace and provide 
mileposts by which to evaluate our progress in providing the energy 
our economy needs while protecting the health safety and 
environment said watkins 
the administration has been under criticism for not moving 
rapidly to put together a detailed energy plan that also considers 
major environmental concerns such as global warming which is 
widely attributed to the burning of fossil fuels 
watkins insisted the department has no preconceived focus on 
such an energy blueprint from washington 
the president emphasized that domestic oil and gas exploration 
and drilling must be expanded to curb the reliance on imports 
attempts to ease public concerns about nuclear power and offshore 
oil exploration are expected to be other key elements of the plan 
according to officials 
our energy security problem continues bush said wednesday 
as he signed the natural gas decontrol bill conservation 
achievements are leveling off domestic oil production continuing 
its downward trend and petroleum imports are increasing and our 
need for a cleaner environment is obvious to all 
watkins noted at a white house briefing that domestic oil 
production is at its lowest point in 25 years while imports have 
jumped 65 percent in the last four years 
later at a hearing before the senate energy and natural 
resources committee watkins emphasized the need to take into 
account environmental concerns in any national energy policy 
but some senators questioned the need for 18 more months of 
factfinding 
im not sure how much more consensus were going to need 
said sen timothy wirth dcolo its time to move 
sen wendell ford dky noted that national energy issues have 
been studied for a decade and it seems like were kind of 
stirring the broth again 
however watkins said the hearings are needed for any future 
energy policy to be widely accepted 
with the lack of credibility my department has right now i 
dont think we can pontificate on what the energy policy should 
be said watkins alluding in part to the energy departments 
recent problems in connection with the handling of waste at its 
nuclear weapons processing plants 
watkins said his department will hold public hearings beginning 
tuesday in washington and followed by sessions in tulsa okla on 
aug 8 boise idaho on aug 23 seattle on aug 30 and 
louisville ky on sept 8 all aimed at producing a draft plan by

the soviet legislature today adopted two 
resolutions paving the way for the baltic republics to have greater 
control of their economies 
the action by the supreme soviet was a major victory for baltic 
activists who have accused moscow of sapping the republics 
natural resources and failing to help preserve their native 
cultures and languages 
one resolution would allow lithuania latvia and estonia to 
trade independently with other soviet republics tass said 
the second resolution approved the main provisions of a draft 
law on economic independence for estonia and lithuania which 
already have declared themselves sovereign states according to the 
official news agency 
all of the economy of estonia will be directly controlled by 
estonian authorities instead of a moscow minister said tarmu 
tammerk an editor at the weekly newspaper kodumaa in tallinn the 
estonian capital 
estonian and lithuanian authorities instead of officials in 
moscow will decide production matters and control how profits are 
spent 
in estonia today russianspeaking workers at 30 businesses were 
on strike to protest what they consider discriminatory laws 
limiting voting rights of immigrants to the republic 
mikhail i lisenk chairman of a strike committee said in a 
telephone interview that 1050 workers were on strike at 
electronics and engine factories and ship repair yards railroad 
workers joined the strike today he said ship repairmen began the 
strike tuesday 
the resolutions call on the council of ministers to draw up 
draft laws on the resolutions and submit them to the supreme soviet 
by oct 1 for approval tass said 
an overwhelming majority of the 412 deputies at todays session 
approved the resolutions tass said 
tammerk said under the provisions of the legislation baltic 
trade relations between moscow and other soviet republics would be 
based on trade agreements with other republics rather than the 
present command system whereby ministers based in moscow make 
economic decisions 
the second resolution according to tass is of an 
organization and preparatory nature and approves the first 
reading of the main provisions of a draft law on economic 
independence for estonia and lithuania 
the second resolution did not apply to latvia because latvian 
deputies did not ask it to they did not participate in the 
drafting of the resolution 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said if 
the draft laws are approved by the supreme soviet in the fall the 
baltic states will have far more control over their economies than 
envisioned by moscow earlier 
the latvian supreme soviet was meeting today to consider whether 
to declare the republic sovereign 
the baltic republics are particularly sensitive to the 
independence issue because many residents there say soviet power is 
illegitimate the soviet union took power the republics in 1940 
under a secret protocol of a soviet pact with nazi germany signed 
the year before 
nationalism in the soviet unions ethnically diverse republics 
has risen under the greater openness promoted by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the result has been often violent clashes 
between ethnic groups

about 800 people will have to stay away 
from their homes at least another day waiting for a chemical fire 
in a railroad tanker car to burn itself out a csx transportation 
inc spokesman said today 
crews used heavy equipment wednesday to widen a rupture in the 
tank cars outer shell to let more air accelerate the blaze but 
the car continued to burn although no toxic fumes were detected 
spokesman lindsay r leckie told a news briefing 
csx meanwhile denied that excessive speed contributed to 
saturdays derailment of 14 cars of a csx train near this saginaw 
county community 
an estimated 3000 people initially were evacuated from a 
15squaremile area said les harcus a spokesman for the saginaw 
county emergency services office 
further investigation of the accident was on hold until the 
chlorosilene fire was out csx spokesman lloyd lewis said from 
company headquarters in jacksonville fla 
under nonbinding federal guidelines issued in 1979 the train 
shouldnt have been traveling more than 30 mph national 
transportation safety board investigator james burnett said 
tuesday that limit 10 mph below the authorized speed for that 
portion of track reflected the tank cars lack of iron plating 
used to protect against rupture in case of derailment 
leckie who said earlier that the train was traveling 37 mph at 
the time of the derailment said wednesday night csx did not 
believe the trains speed was a factor in the accident 
at least four people were released monday from a saginaw 
hospital following treatment for skin irritation and nausea an 
undetermined number of people reported similar symptoms earlier

canadians began returning home today

from the cross lake indian reserve returned to their homes a few 
hours later said spokesman john paupanekis 
the 3600 residents of the community had spent the week since

dormitories in the mining city of thompson about 125 miles to the 
north of the reserve 
they were among the 27000 people forced from their homes by the 
fires in northern manitoba saskatchewan and ontario no injuries 
or deaths have been reported

under control wednesday but hundreds of fires in the three 
provinces most started by lightning kept burning today 
manitoba premier gary filmon has said the firefighting and 
evacuation will cost the provincial government 30 million

an allwhite swim club which barred three 
black teenagers from using a pool it leased from the jaycees will 
open the facility to blacks next week an official said today 
the jaycees closed the pool leased to the saluda swim and tennis 
club wednesday and said it could not reopen until it is 
desegregated 
after a wednesday night meeting the clubs sevenmember board 
agreed to the jaycees demands board president robert booth said 
today 
in 1989 its the moral thing to do he said he said the 
pool would reopen on aug 5 and admit blacks and whites 
the club refused to admit the teenagers july 13 because the 
land on which the pool sits was willed in 1933 by george c wheeler 
to the town with a provision that it be used as a recreation area 
for whites only the town deeded the property to the jaycees in 
1955 with the provision intact 
lawyers say such provisions are legally unenforceable 
the three black teenagers were with a united methodist church 
group that had made a reservation to use the pool after spending 
the day renovating a dilapidated home 
the club offered to allow whites in the group to swim but the 
entire group of about 50 left when the black youths were turned 
away said willie teague editor of the church newspaper 
the club has no black members and no black has ever applied 
booth said earlier 
before the pool is reopened the club will review its bylaws to 
make sure they contain no discriminatory provisions 
we just want to make sure that it is a completely open 
membership he said 
new members will be charged 85 per family per season said 
booth 
saluda population 3000 is about 45 miles west of columbia it 
is 40 percent black 
the jaycees numbering 240000 nationally prohibit 
discrimination based on race sex or creed the organization was 
founded as a leadership training group in 1920 and is open to men 
and women ages 21 through 39

the house voted today to urge president bush 
to open negotiations with the soviet union aimed at banning the 
production of plutonium and enriched uranium the materials used in 
nuclear weapons 
the vote for the nonbinding resolution attached to a defense 
authorization bill was 284138 
supporters of the amendment said such negotiations are a logical 
and needed next step in the arms control process 
but opponents said such a ban would be impossible to verify and 
would put the united states at a serious disadvantage because it 
has no currently operating nuclear enrichment production plants 
while the soviet union has 12 to 14 going at full blast 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee said the talks could resolve an tremendous 
imbalance in which the soviets are adding to their nuclear 
stockpile while us production stands at zero 
this is an effort to get us on the negotiating track and deal 
with this problem if possible he said this is an expression 
of congress saying mr president see what you can do 
rep bob walker rpa replied that the bush administration 
opposes the measure and that us arms negotiators are against it 
because an agreement could not be verified 
lets not do something stupid walker said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said he worried that congress might with such 
suggestions overload the arms control agenda 
working through the defense bill the house was expected to 
tackle later such thorny issues as the f14d tomcat fighter plane 
and possibly the v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft two programs 
defense secretary dick cheney has proposed canceling as a 
budgetreduction step 
the house voted wednesday to curb production of the 
radarevading stealth bomber program but cheney expressed relief 
the chamber had not killed the 70 billion program outright 
cheney said the white house hopes a house conference with the 
senate to resolve differences in the two chambers versions of the 
295 billion defense authorization bill will remove the roadblocks 
and permit a fast start for production of the costly bomber 
they the administration have in effect a year to 
restructure the program to prove through tests its worth 
buying aspin told reporters its the core of the argument we 
dont know enough right now to make a decision 
the aspin amendment would require the pentagon to meet rigid 
test and performance standards before additional stealth bombers 
are purchased it would limit to two the number of bombers to be 
purchased over the next two fiscal years 
the administration suffered an unwanted budget cut wednesday 
when the house approved an amendment to reduce by 502 million the 
11 billion earmarked for spare mx missiles and for a rail system 
bush requested to make the mx a mobile system the 224197 vote 
does not affect the nearly 800 million earmarked for the missiles 
themselves 
the senate voting 981 on tuesday endorsed president bushs 
twoyear request for 47 billion for stealth production 
conditioned on the aircraft meeting flighttest and radarevasion 
standards 
before adopting the aspin amendment the house defeated a 
proposal to eliminate the program outright 
the osprey and the tomcat were put on the house agenda after 
lawmakers from pennsylvania new york and texas expressed dismay 
with their cancellation 
the v22 a tiltrotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter 
but can fly like a plane is manufactured by boeing helicopter co 
and bell helicopter textron inc located in pennsylvania and texas 
the pentagon had planned to spend 259 billion on 663 ospreys 
including 13 billion in fiscal 1990 
the tomcat manufactured by the grumman corp on long island 
also had come under cheneys ax 
but the house armed services committee voted last month to 
restore 157 million for the osprey in fiscal 1990 and about 230 
million for the tomcat

group to negotiate with israel even before a government peace plan 
is put into effect he said the arabs involved were not linked to 
the palestine liberation organization 
the prime minister reacting to reports that indirect talks have 
been held between israel and the plo said even arafats acceptance

any future any spark of understanding between myself and this 
guy shamir said

was conducting indirect talks with the plo senior officials and 
legislators from the leftofcenter labor party said wednesday that 
israel was in contact with the plo in an effort to win approval of

partners in a coalition government 
the peace initiative calls for electing palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and the gaza strip to negotiate with israel on 
interim selfrule with later talks on the final status of the 
territories 
the fact that there are negotiations on this subject with the 
plo is clear and it has one aim to get a green light from the plo 
for elections in the territories yossi beilin an aide to labor

contacts were carried out through the united states egypt and 
romania

seven palestinians and a kenyan can sue the 
us government for allegedly targeting them for prosecution 
because of their political beliefs a federal judge has ruled 
us district judge stephen v wilson in allowing trial to 
proceed criticized the government wednesday for filing new charges 
against two of the palestinians under a law allowing the exclusion 
and deportation of aliens deemed undesirable 
the justice department has been trying for 2 years to deport 
the eight accusing them of having ties to a terrorist group the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine 
but none of the eight has been charged with criminal acts and 
all have denied membership in the organization 
the government first attempted to deport them under a section of 
the mccarranwalter act that allowed deportation of people for 
affiliations with groups advocating world communism 
totalitarianism or property destruction 
in december wilson declared those provisions of the act 
unconstitutional 
the government then accused six of the defendants of visa 
violations and two of violations under the section of the 
mccarranwalter act dealing with undesirable aliens 
the eight along with several immigrant rights groups responded 
by suing the government 
the judge said he was disturbed by the governments tactics 
i dont see how this new section of mccarranwalter is all 
that different than the one we ruled on wilson told government 
lawyers are we going to have to deal with each section of the 
mccarranwalter act piece by piece

the us war on drugs in peru and bolivia 
remains dangerous and ineffective with negligible amounts of 
cocaine being halted despite more than 100 million spent on the 
problem over the past 17 years the state departments internal 
watchdog told congress today 
the programs have not resulted in significant reductions of 
coca cultivation or the disruption of cocaine trafficking in the 
host countries said state department inspector general sherman 
funk whose staff just returned from the region 
coca production in these countries has increased every year 
and less than 1 percent of the illicit drugs have been seized 
funk told the senate foreign relations narcotics subcommittee 
adding it is uncertain whether the programs can be made to work 
but the program was defended by its top officials who contended 
the operation in those two countries dubbed operation snowcap 
is still developing and is improving 
we cannot wait for a perfect solution said david westrate 
assistant administrator for operations of the drug enforcement 
administration were not going to solve this problem making 
fivekilo cases in cleveland ohio 
the hearing focused on a march report by funks office that 
found us personnel face unnecessary danger in bolivia and peru 
and criticized the programs for waste and ineffectiveness 
the report quoted a us embassy official in lima as saying it 
is only a matter of time before americans are killed in perus 
upper huallaga valley a region controlled by the heavily armed 
sendero luminoso or shining path guerrillas 
funks office found that dea agents are coordinating air assault 
operations of the civil police in peru and the military in bolivia 
even though most do not speak spanish and have no appropriate 
military training 
peru and bolivia are the worlds leading producers of coca leaf 
the raw material for cocaine 
citing the report subcommittee chairman john kerry dmass 
called government efforts to eradicate coca crops a dismal 
failure saying they are indicative of disarray in the war on 
drugs 
but dea spokesman frank shults said the march 1989 report based 
on visits to peru and bolivia by investigators a year ago was 
very dated and added improvements have been made in the 
antidrug program 
our program in latin america is one that is evolutionary 
there have been problems and weve been making changes he said 
in peru the threat from the shining path guerrillas has caused 
the united states to pull back while a more secure operations base 
is built for them and most eradication activity is on hold 
as an example of the problems the audit said bolivian military 
units were trained for their drug assaults by us army special 
forces teams but pentagon rules prohibit the soldiers from 
accompanying bolivian units on jungle forays so dea agents are 
left to coordinate field operations 
the agents often issued orders to troops that were at odds with 
what they had been taught by the us army such as running down a 
trail after landing in a helicopter in hopes of discovering a 
cocaine laboratory or fanning out and walking abreast through the 
brush such tactics defeated the purpose of the training and were 
dangerous the report said 
among other problems outlined in the report 
aircraft operated by the departments bureau of international 
narcotics matters are run in bolivia without flight plans or proper 
equipment and are poorly maintained 
bolivian drug interdiction searches have been an expensive 
failure air searches run by the dea seem random or are based on 
unreliable intelligence and yield little it said just three drug 
arrests were reported in the beni region in northeast bolivia in a 
2year period and 1700 helicopter flight hours in 1987 costing 
17 million yielded just 148 pounds of cocaine and the 
destruction of 22 crude laboratories 
administrative snags with the peruvian government resulted in 
wasting more than 1 million on leased aircraft in 1987 the state 
department paid for 98 days but received just 14 days service 
the manual coca eradication program in peru has been 
ineffective the department spent 2 million in 1987 to eradicate 
355 hectares of coca crops and there was suspicion that there 
could have been phantom employees on the programs payroll

a judge fined the united mine workers nearly 
45 million today for what he called acts of terror in the 
coalfields 
russell county circuit judge donald mcglothlin jr who earlier 
fined the umw nearly 3 million for violating orders limiting 
strike activities blasted the union for assaulting and threatening 
people during the nearly 4monthlong strike against the pittston 
coal group inc 
there has been a feeling of terror throughout much of this 
area the judge said 
he said there has been a tremendous outpouring of public 
money spent protecting residents from union violence and a loss of 
tax revenues directly attributable to the violent acts of these 
defendants 
mcglothlin ordered that 2 million of the fines be paid to the 
state 1 million to dickenson county and almost 15 million to 
russell county he also ordered that all umw members be restrained 
from impeding traffic around entrances to pittston property and 
from interfering with local traffic 
many of the fines stemmed from mcglothlins finding that the 
union failed to stop its members or supporters from forming convoys 
of slowdriving vehicles that have delayed the hauling of pittston 
coal 
umw attorney mike passino said he expected the union would 
appeal the judges ruling 
late wednesday umw president richard trumka urged union 
supporters from across the country to visit southwest virginias 
coal fields and see a system that doesnt have room for workers 
in it 
im asking people of conscience to come to southwest virginia 
and see the system he told a crowd of about 4000 at a rally in 
st paul va theyll keep coming until every one of you have a 
contract and every one of our pensioners is taken care of 
he said the effort wouldnt be a national strike and that he 
didnt expect miners to miss work to come to virginia 
the strike involves about 1900 umw members in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky miners at pittston had been working without 
a contract for 14 months when they went on strike april 5 over 
sunday and overtime work and other issues 
pittston contends the umw is trying to force the company to 
ratify an agreement reached last year with other coal producers 
that the company says would threaten its economic stability the 
umw says pittston is trying to break the union 
talks between the union and pittston resumed last week but 
after no progress was reported tuesday further talks were put off 
until aug 1 
virginia police were investigating two incidents wednesday night 
they considered strikerelated said sgt mike frank 
in dickenson county the windshields of nine vehicles owned by 
striking miners parked at lamberts fork mine were smashed frank 
said in tazewell county a private residence owned by two working 
miners and a vehicle parked there were shot at frank said a 
camping trailer next door was torched 
no injuries were reported and no arrests have been made frank 
said

the state says it will leave it up to 
the federal government to pursue criminal charges against exxon or 
the alyeska pipeline service co for the nations worst oil spill 
state attorneys concluded that federal authorities have tougher 
laws and stiffer penalties for environmental crimes such as the 
spill of more than 10 million gallons of crude oil from the tanker 
exxon valdez chief prosecutor larry weeks said wednesday 
the money the state feels it would take to do a thorough job 
compared to the possible punishment we could impose is not in 
proportion weeks said 
under state law the most corporations and their officers might 
face would be misdemeanors with fines up to 100000 weeks said 
under federal law the same violations would be felonies with fines 
triple the amount of actual damages 
the decision to not pursue criminal charges wont affect the 
states plan to take civil action against exxon and alyeska except 
to make more money available for the civil litigation weeks said 
federal authorities have confirmed they are considering criminal 
charges in connection with the march 24 spill in prince william 
sound but the us attorneys office refers all inquiries to the 
fbi which will say only that it is investigating

the royal air force has restricted flights of its 
32 chinook helicopters and launched an investigation into two 
crashes of the twinrotor aircraft this week the air force said 
thursday 
the crashes monday and tuesday resulted in only minor injuries 
to those on board but as a precaution few if any flights of 
chinooks would take place for now the spokesman said 
as a precautionary measure raf chinook flying is being 
restricted to that which is operationally essential until the 
causes of the two accidents have been identified the spokesman 
said 
he said it was too early to know the cause of the crashes 
in the first crash two men suffered minor injuries when a 
chinook went down while hovering a few feet above the ground three 
others aboard were not hurt 
on tuesday a second chinook crashed while in a low hover at the 
mount pleasant airfield on the falkland islands five of the eight 
men on board were slightly injured 
last year the us army grounded its 234 chinooks for 
transmission checks after their manufacturer boeing said certain 
transmissions were improperly assembled ten us army chinooks 
have been involved in crashes since 1985 
the royal air force also grounded its fleet in 1986 after a 
civilian version of the chinook crashed in the north sea killing 
45 people a faulty gearbox was blamed

president bush said today that the case of 
felix s bloch the veteran us diplomat suspected of spying 
spotlights an ongoing concern about improving the nations 
counterintelligence capabilities

always ought to be striving to do that bush told reporters 
during an oval office photo session can embassy security be 
improved we go through this periodically and the answer is im 
sure it can 
the president was asked whether he thought the bloch case 
pointed up a need for improvements in the counterintelligence 
system as has been suggested by some members of congress 
you are always concerned about people who are willing to 
betray their country bush replied noting that he headed the cia 
for a year in the 1970s in the case of bloch who has not been 
charged with any crime he said its counterintelligence 
capability of our country that at least is bringing some of these 
facts to light

the bloch case which remains under investigation

hubert de givenchy and per spook wound up a week of 
winter shows thursday with two different types of parisienne 
the givenchy lady was a savvy sophisticate while per spooks 
had an appealing ingenue look 
gianfranco ferre of dior won the golden thimble prize awarded 
twice yearly to the most creative haute couturier the italianborn 
designer trained as an architect was chosen in may to replace 
marc bohan at the worlds most prestigious fashion house bohan won 
a golden thimble for dior last summer 
ferres beautifully constructed clothes in fabulous fabrics gave 
a lift and a new new look to diors fashion scene and appealed 
to the jury of 28 international fashion writers 
there was not much strikingly new about givenchys collection 
although the outfits were beautiful sumptuous and seductive 
the silhouette stayed in place firmly feminine and with shapely 
padded shoulders in spite of the trend to shrug off big shoulders 
as a thing of the past waists were small and skirts for daytime 
invariably bared the knee 
with long jackets and big round buttons the suits often were in 
shades of chocolate brown beige or rust and looked timely topped 
by full capes a new note at givenchy or seveneighths coats in 
a contrasting color lined with lynx fox or badger they struck 
the right note of understated wealth 
but it was givenchys afterdark clothes that were most 
intriguing the gold brocades with furedged scooped necks the 
rich ruby and sapphire satin cocktail suits with appliques and 
embroidery the draped floral chiffons in heavenly shades of 
violet yellow mandarin or royal blue were fit for a grand 
opening 
watch for the greek cross neck pendant givenchy showed it in 
sparkly rhinestones but it crops up elsewhere as well for a more 
brazen woman givenchy paired up his sharply tailored jackets with 
silkfringed skirts 
but the dramatic appeal of his peacock satin sheath with jeweled 
embroidery at the decollete and sleeves was true to givenchys 
penchant for women who like to shine at night without looking too 
far out 
norwegianborn per spooks collection featured a colorful 
rickrackedged wolfskin coat and pointed toque 
this rickrack edging on high collars belts and sleeves gave a 
folklore look to a lot of clothes which featured pants from 
skintight toreadors to full short culottes long straight trousers 
and full harem pants for evening 
the spook day clothes had a very norwegian appeal in brightly 
knit patterns on jacquard sweaters knee socks and caps but they 
smacked more of expensive readytowear than couture 
skirts tended to be long and full and colors ranged from mixes 
of the chocolatecoffee browns especially good teamed with 
robins egg turquoise to hot coral and orange 
his evening dresses in pleated chiffons or fullskirted 
damasked silk skirts topped by chiffon blouses were opulent 
as this years signature print spook chose the eiffel tower in 
honor of its centennial throwing it on several outfits from 
blouses to coats 
among the italians valentino got a big hand for his fitted 
festive day and cocktail clothes often using his favorite hot red 
and fuchsia although his show finished in a blaze of rich satins 
and silks for ball gowns 
gianni versace held a show late thursday in the jacquemartandre 
museum featuring his outfits strikingly displayed on headless 
dummies 
there was a good deal of leather persian lamb and metal decor 
on the handsome truncated minioutfits and tuxedotype clothes that 
probably looked better on the forms than on most women 
the glittering underwear shifts topped with dark 
flowerembroidered sheer chiffon dressinggown coats displayed a 
cheeky boudoir chic that looked vaguely inspired by poiret 
paris designers dont seem concerned about italians invading 
their turf jacques mouclier president of the chambre syndicale 
the powerful designers association said if they want to show 
here thats all right it means were still on top in the couture 
world 
mouclier has welcomed talented foreigners to paris and was not 
surprised when three of them japanese hanae mori italian angelo 
tarlazzi and spanishborn paco rabanne were awarded the legion of 
honor in july

a senate panel today postponed until next week 
a vote on on william lucas nomination to be the justice 
departments civil rights chief after an undecided member said he 
wanted to study new information about lucas 
sen howell heflin dala whose vote could decide whether or 
not the senate judiciary committee endorses lucas asked for the 
delay because of material that has come to my attention in the 
last few hours 
heflin did not describe the information but he later indicated 
that if forced to vote today he might not have joined the panels 
republicans in supporting lucas to be assistant attorney general 
for civil rights 
im prepared to vote it may not be the way you want me to 
vote heflin told sen strom thurmond rsc 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel the panels chairman 
rescheduled the vote for next tuesday morning saying there would 
be no further delays in committee action on lucas nomination 
republican supporters of lucas a black republican from detroit 
with a background in law enforcement voiced concern that a further 
delay would likely prevent the full senate from taking up the 
nomination until after its summer recess which begins aug 4 
sen alan simpson rwyo said further delay would only give 
lucas opponents enough time to get out and gin it up 
civil rights groups and other organizations that oppose lucas 
are waiting to do a number and all they need is time simpson 
said i can just see these selfannointed ones with their phone 
banks going goofy in the next five weeks 
the delay came a day after lucas received support from sen 
arlen specter rpa the only gop senator whose support for the 
nomination was in doubt 
specter dismissing opponents arguments that lucas lacked the 
legal qualifications for the job said 
its more important to have someone who understands supreme 
court decisions from personal experience knows it so to speak in 
his gut as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the 
commas and semicolons 
sen dennis deconcini dariz is leaning toward voting in 
favor of lucas but his position is not final heflin who has not 
taken a position had been considered the biggest question mark 
among committee members 
if heflin joined deconcini and the six republicans in supporting 
lucas the nomination would go to the senate with a favorable 
recommendation 
however the nomination could still go to the full senate 
without any recommendation from the panel or an unfavorable 
recommendation if heflin votes against confirmation 
lucas 61 a lifelong democrat who joined the gop in 1985 was 
sheriff and later chief executive of wayne county which includes 
detroit he ran unsuccessfully for michigan governor as a 
republican in 1986 
outside the committee room heflin refused to disclose the 
nature of the new information saying the allegations are not 
substantiated 
its just something that ought to be explored he added 
it may not be worth a line in print on page 56 i dont know 
whether its serious or not 
heflin expressed concern about a number of items on lucas 
record saying he discussed a couple of them with president 
bush during a telephone call today in which the president solicited 
his vote for lucas 
i told him i would give his request deep consideration 
heflin said 
heflin also said he wanted to review a great number of 
different instances on lucas record before making up his mind 
these included a contemptofcourt citation against lucas for 
failure to improve jail conditions when he was sheriff and a 594 
fine he paid to the us customs service for failing to fully 
report 8884 worth of merchandise he and his his family bought 
during a trip to the far east heflin said 
this customs matter is a serious matter heflin said the 
senator said it appeared that information about the customs 
incident was not available to the president at the time he made 
the nomination 
david runkel spokesman for attorney general dick thornburgh 
said we remain confident that mr lucas will be confirmed by the 
senate 
if senator heflin needs more time we will be cooperative 
with the senator runkel said adding that the department and 
lucas will respond to any questions that heflin wants to raise

nissan motor co management on thursday welcomed 
the defeat of an attempt to unionize its tennessee plant while 
japanese unions which were not part of the organizing effort 
there said they respected the workers vote 
american workers at nissans smyrna tenn automobile plant 
voted to reject a campaign by the united auto workers to unionize 
their factory 
a nissan spokesman said the vote showed that workers appreciated 
participatory management practices the spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity said nissan planned to expand production at 
smyrna and hire 2000 more employees 
analysts said the defeat of the uaw after a failed attempt to 
unionize a honda plant in ohio was likely to encourage 
manufacturing investment in the united states by japanese companies 
wary of unions 
japanese companies have an allergy to usstyle unions a 
resounding victory by the union might have discouraged further 
investment said stephen marvin an automobile industry analyst 
at jardine fleming securities in tokyo in japan unions are 
generally organized by the company rather than industry wage 
demands are moderate and strikes are rare in 1987 the united 
states lost 16 times more workdays to strikes than did japan 
the union of nissan workers in japan and the confederation of 
japan automobile workers unions the main auto industry labor 
group had not participated in the uaw 18month attempt to unionize 
the tennessee plant 
although some japanese union officials expressed disappointment 
with the defeat the confederation said it respected the vote 
the uaw was not able to reach its objective this time but we 
anticipate it will be able to make continued efforts to organize in 
a peaceful manner not only at smyrna but at the us plants of 
other japanese firms in the united states the statement said 
critics of japanese unions say they are weak while other 
analysts say they preserve workers rights by focusing on the 
longterm health of their companies rather than wage increases 
the japanese philosophy of managementworker cooperation has 
resulted in job security for fulltime auto workers but relatively 
low wages and long working hours 
japanese unions engaged in often violent disputes in the 1950s 
but since then management and workers generally have agreed on 
restraint by both sides companies dont fire workers in hard 
times and workers dont demand big pay increases even in good 
times 
when workers calculate wage demands they think first of all 
of their companys ability to compete with other companies each 
employee tries to make a judgment as if he were the president of 
the company says kenichi kobayashi professor of economics at 
hosei university 
although nissans profits grew 121 percent in the year ending in 
march workers won wage increases of only 48 percent in this 
springs negotiations 
but when nissan lost 58 million in fiscal 1986 there were no 
layoffs of fulltime workers and employees received a 303 percent 
pay raise 
in this years negotiations japanese auto makers granted an 
average wage increase of 513 percent resulting in an average 
yearly salary of 31428 including bonuses but not overtime 
union membership in all industries in japan is at an alltime 
low of 27 percent of workers while the rate in the united states 
is even lower at 175 percent according to the labor ministry 
but while the uaw has seen membership decline 33 percent in 10 
years the japanese confederations membership has been growing in 
recent years and now stands at 730000

a korean air dc10 with 199 people aboard crashed in 
heavy fog today short of the runway at tripoli airport in libya 
hitting homes and cars and bursting into flames at least 82 people 
were killed including four on the ground officials and news 
reports said 
libyas official jana news agency said the crash the second in 
eight days of a dc10 occurred at 730 am 130 am edt the 
cause was not immediately known 
the pilot was quoted as saying visibility was poor about an 
hour earlier a soviet jetliner rerouted to malta rather than land 
in the fog 
early reports from tripoli indicate that weather may have been 
a contributing factor said james reed a spokesman in washington 
for mcdonnell douglas corp which manufactures dc10s 
the korean broadcasting system quoted south koreas consul in 
tripoli chang kyungsoo as saying the plane attempted a belly 
landing but this could not be confirmed 
kbs also said the pilot reported engine trouble but the airline 
did not confirm this 
the jet crashed into an orchard about 15 miles from the runway 
cartwheeled 400 yards broke into pieces and caught fire chang 
said 
on july 19 a united air lines dc10 crashed in sioux city 
iowa killing 111 people after the tail engine blew apart and cut 
off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to steer the plane 
a diplomat at the south korean embassy in tripoli who 
identified himself as first secretary mr chun said in a telephone 
interview that 78 people on the plane were killed 
jana reported that in addition four people died on the ground 
when the jet slammed into two houses 
tripoli hospitals were reportedly treating 113 victims and 66 
were in good condition and would be released within hours 
eight people were treated and released the agency reported 
one of the survivors kwon hyukhwi of south korea told korean 
television the plane crashed shortly after the pilot announced it 
was about to land 
instantly there was a crushing impact and then came shrieks 
by horrified people i kept my body as low as possible and lost 
consciousness said kwon he said the tail hit the roof of a 
farmhouse and the front section rammed the top of a concrete wall 
around the farm 
chang told the television the accident site was strewn with 
charred bodies and debris 
airline officials in seoul said 189 of the 199 aboard were south 
koreans the rest were japanese and libyans 
government officials in seoul said there were no signs the jet 
was the target of terrorism as was a korean air flight that 
crashed in 1987 
italian television showed the planes tail sticking up from the 
rubble of a house hundreds of rescue workers carried away bodies 
as firefighters hosed down the smoldering wreckage 
korean television showed a large bulldozer moving debris and 
charred wreckage spewed over a wide area one of the engines lay in 
a crater 
jana said the plane also hit cars on a road near the airport 
which is about a 40minute drive from the libyan capital 
korean air in seoul said flight 803 left the south korean 
capital wednesday evening with stops in bangkok thailand and 
jiddah saudi arabia en route to tripoli 
korean broadcasting system said many of the koreans aboard were 
workers for daewoo corp and donga construction co which have 
projects in libya 
airline officils quoted the planes captain kim hojung 54 as 
saying the airport was shrouded in a dense fog and visibility 
was poor when i approached i lost contact with the control tower 
for 15 minutes before the crash 
jana said the airport control tower told kim the visibility was 
only 800 feet a soviet aeroflot airliner informed of similar 
conditions about an hour earlier decided to land instead in malta 
said a jana editor speaking on condition of anonymity 
the dc10 crashed 25 minutes before it was scheduled to land 
reed said mcdonnell douglas efforts to obtain information about 
the crash were hampered because the united states has no diplomatic 
representatives in libya 
korean air is a privately owned national flag carrier and the 
largest of two korean airlines it said the dc10 was purchased in 
january 1977 
formerly known as korean air lines the airlines flight 007 was 
shot down over soviet air space by soviet fighters on sept 1 
1983 killing 269 people 
on nov 29 1987 115 people died when a korean air flight from 
baghdad iraq to seoul was lost over the andaman sea near burma 
south korea charged north korea with placing a bomb on the plane a 
north korean agent was sentenced to death in connection with the 
incident earlier this year

a canadian patrol boat chased an american fishing 
boat all night after allegedly spotting the scalloper filling its 
nets in canadian waters the coast guard said today 
the new bedford ship the bountiful stopped briefly this 
morning off nantucket after the canadian vessel broke off its 
140mile pursuit and then headed in to port officials said 
the canadian government denied the patrol boat cygnus permission 
to fire warning shots across the bountifuls bow after the american 
fishing vessel allegedly rammed it wednesday afternoon the coast 
guard said 
coast guard officials said they planned to board the bountiful 
when it docked and petty officer 1st class greg creedon said 
representatives from the national marine fisheries service also 
would investigate 
were interested in talking with the vessel to find out what 
exactly happened and collect documentation he said 
the bountiful was allegedly seven nautical miles into canadian 
fishing waters about 165 miles east of nantucket when it was 
spotted by the cygnus wednesday the coast guard said 
the us territorial limit is 12 miles from shore 
coast guard chief petty officer jack mason said about 10 us 
fishing boats have been accused of poaching in canadian waters this 
year 
such incidents are on the rise because fishing stocks on the 
us side of the uscanadian fisheries line are being depleted 
and the canadians are aggressively patrolling their waters he said 
one new bedford boat was pursued by the canadians for 14 hours 
recently and last year canadian patrols fired on another new 
bedford scalloper the donna lynn after its captain refused to let 
officials board the american skipper claimed the boat was in us 
waters 
with tensions mounting the state department on monday invited 
canadian diplomats to meet in washington next week to resolve the 
tense disputes between the fishermen and the patrol boats 
petty officer ellen marie harrington said the service radioed 
the bountiful advising it to stop for its own safety but the 
fishing boat did not respond 
once inside the 12 miles mason said a coast guard cutter would 
escort the bountiful to new bedford where it would be boarded 
and inspected if the vessel were found to have been fishing 
illegally it could be fined and its permit lifted 
the canadian boat was allowed to pursue the bountiful into the 
200mile us exclusive economic zone 
mason identified the bountifuls owner as edward perry of new 
bedford

the senate moved on thursday to boost federal 
spending above president bushs request on a range of domestic food 
programs and prodded the government to do a more aggressive job of 
monitoring food labeling 
in approving a 443 billion agriculture spending bill for 
fiscal 1990 the senate also agreed to remove a cap on subsidies 
the government pays to commodity exporters 
bush wants the subsidy ceiling eliminated arguing that it 
hinders american efforts to win concessions at trade talks with the 
european economic community but the house has already voted to 
retain the cap with opponents saying increasing the spending would 
merely benefit mammoth grain export firms 
senate passage of the bill on a voice vote means that senators 
must now reconcile their legislation with the 421 billion version 
of the measure that the house approved on july 18 
the measure is one of the 13 annual appropriations bills for 
federal agencies fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 
the senate would expand federal spending for an assortment of 
domestic food assistance programs to 188 billion 15 billion 
more than bush sought in the budget he sent congress in february 
and 2 billion above 1989 levels 
this includes 49 billion for child nutrition programs about 
the same as bushs request 21 billion for food aid to women 
infants and children 200 million above bushs figure and 154 
billion for food stamps 13 billion above the bush number 
a report approved with the bill also directs the food and drug 
administration to move forward with clarifying the meanings of 
natural lowfat lite and other terms food producers 
commonly place on their labels 
the report criticized the fda for the slow pace and the mixed 
signals the agency has exhibited with its work on food labeling 
however the report did not address the controversy over red dye 
no 3 the food coloring that is considered a potential carcinogen 
in its measure the house ordered the government to refrain from 
banning the food coloring until longrange studies of the dyes 
health effects are completed 
report language is not legally binding agencies must take such 
commands seriously however or risk antagonizing lawmakers who can 
retaliate against offending bureaucrats in future bills 
the export subsidy cap which this year limits payments from 
the export enhancement program to 770 million was first imposed 
by congress last year 
the bill provides 116 billion for rural development and 
assistance programs 200 million above bushs request 
the commodity credit corp the agriculture department agency 
that distributes price and income support payments to farmers 
would get 48 billion the same as bushs request and 4 billion 
below this years level the savings arise from higher commodity 
prices which drive down federal aid and changes in the law 
the bill also sets aside 57 million for aids research by fda 
17 million above this years level 
as he has said he will do on all 13 appropriations bills sen 
david pryor dark offered an amendment limiting the money the 
government can spend for consultants of whom he has long been 
critical his provision adopted on a voice vote limits the 
agriculture department to spending 473 million next year to hire 
private contractors to conduct studies and do other agency work

a group of top democratic senators said today 
they have reached agreement on a 330 million package of public 
service programs that should be ready for floor action next week 
the varied plan would offer public service opportunities to 
americans of all ages with rewards and incentives ranging from 
academic credit to vouchers for down payments on homes or for 
higher education 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and 
human resources committee said at least 10 service bills had been 
introduced this year in the senate the consensus measure 
includes the best features of all the bills and the price tag is 
within realistic constraints he said 
kennedy said he expects his committee to send the bill to the 
floor next week and anticipates action by the end of the year 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
compromise bill a significant step and said the concept has support 
from republicans as well as democrats we will work with our 
republican colleagues our colleagues in the house and with the 
white house to pass it he said 
key elements of the package include 
100 million for school and collegebased opportunities for 
young people to serve their communities 
100 million for youth service corps programs modeled after the 
conservation corps already established in many states 
100 million for a program giving education and housing 
vouchers to people who participate in fulltime or parttime 
community service 
10 million to expand vista 
20 million to expand volunteer programs for senior citizens 
under the older americans act 
the bill contains elements of proposals by sens kennedy sam 
nunn dga charles robb dva barbara mikulski dmd 
claiborne pell dri christopher dodd dconn bob graham 
dfla and daniel patrick moynihan dny 
one component missing from the package was nunns original 
proposal to make student financial aid contingent on a fulltime 
public service stint the bill he introduced with robb envisioned 
phasing out current forms of student aid in five years 
the idea generated a storm of controversy among democrats and 
republicans alike many of whom said it would penalize lowincome 
students while allowing the affluent to escape service obligations 
and proceed directly with their educations 
nunn said today that parts of the compromise bill constitute an 
experimental version of his plan and he has not given up hope of 
eventually making national service the principal means of getting 
student aid 
i havent dropped my original thinking on the subject but i 
do think we ought to go slowly and determine what works he said

six months after ronald reagan left the white 
house historians and political scientists asked to guess how 
history will rate his presidency rank him in the middle between 
great and dreadful 
calvin coolidges name keeps coming up in comparison 
coolidge was strong for keeping things from being done says 
lewis gould a university of texas historian 
he also says reagan has elements of fdr in his ability to 
communicate but he thinks that ultimately reagan will wind up 
in the middle or lowermiddle ranks 
frank freidel professor emeritus at both harvard and the 
university of washington and a biographer of franklin d roosevelt 
doesnt draw the fdr analogy instead he compares reagan to dwight 
eisenhower 
if i had to rank him right now i would rank him as high as 
dwight eisenhower says freidel 73 both were total charmers 
both clung to the same sort of smalltown middle western verities 
both were men of principle both to a certain extent were handsoff 
presidents 
eisenhower biographer fred greenstein of princeton university 
on the other hand said ike never had a scandal like irancontra 
and never had his weaknesses laid bare in kissandtell books like 
those that have come out about reagan 
i dont think hell be rated high on competence says 
greenstein who compares reagan to scandalsinged ulysses grant 
someone who had substantial public support but left a rather 
messy legacy 
political scientist thomas cronin of colorado college says 
reagan will have to be judged as having made a consequence he 
gives the former president top grades for his ceremonial roles as 
the national cheerleader the national chaplain he was able to 
rally the american spirit 
on the other hand reagan was insensitive to womens rights 
civil rights oblivious to what was going on in his own 
administration the procurement scandle hud irancontra 
cronin says an ethical sleaze characterised his administration 
it seems a reincarnation of the warren harding attitude 
great its hard to say whether hell be great says henry 
graff a columbia univesity historian 
well see what happens to the economy hell get high marks 
for having been on watch when the cold war began to peter out for 
all the bravado and macho style hell be remembered as one of the 
peacemakers 
reagan was a handsoff chairmanoftheboard type president 
says donald mccoy of the university of kansas a coolidge 
biographer and one historian who does not draw the coolidge 
parallel 
as chairman of the board he wasnt terrific at it but on the 
other hand he wasnt a failure either mccoy says what shall 
we say soso average fair 
reagans place will be determined by events yet to happen 
several historians say 
if russia doesnt explode and gorbachev continues his program 
of perestroika and glasnost ronald reagan will have a very 
signficant place in history says freidel 
adds political scientist charles dunn of clemson university 
reagans reputation historically will fly upon the wings of 
gorbachev and bush 
some of those interviewed said historians and political 
scientists tend to be harder on presidents than the general public 
john f kennedy for example still ranks high in public esteem but 
kennedy according to gould is sinking among historians with 
almost every passing year 
others noted that historians tend to be liberals and so may be 
rougher on reagan than the public at large 
a number of the specialists said reagans reputation has dimmed 
since he left washington partly because the scandal at the 
department of housing and urban development underscored that reagan 
did not pay close attention 
i frankly have been surprised that he has gone down as much as 
he has in six months says gould that we have another 
president who has done reasonably well sort of overshadows reagan 
his positive contributions revitalizing the presidency 
turning the country to the right peace and for six of the eight 
years prosperity and to some extent ending the cold war these 
have already been discounted gould adds now i suspect the 
negatives will come into play 
but philip rulon history professor at northern arizona 
university in flagstaff and a selfdescribed liberal democrat 
credits reagan with having saved the presidency after a string 
of failed presidencies going back to kennedy 
whatever reagans policy shortcomings rulon says he made 
people respect the president again he was a great irish wit he 
had grace and style he is a communicator and a man of integrity 
and he preserved the office

it was a rainy gloomy evening and 
president fidel castro seemed in a kindred mood speaking of 
inhuman american capitalists bent on a new colonialism and of 
possible civil war in the soviet union 
this is the national holiday week that celebrates the beginning 
of the revolution in 1953 a time of picnics parties dancing and 
drinking 
castros twohour message wednesday delivered in rain that 
soaked him to the skin the week before his 63rd birthday was more 
appropriate for a wake 
he told the tens of thousands crowded into camagueys main plaza 
the united states was like adolf hitlers germany dreaming about 
an empire of 1000 years 
cubans must prepare for a war of attrition total blockade even 
invasion and occupation he said 
the specter of civil war haunts the soviet union and cubans 
should not be surprised to wake up some morning and find that their 
powerful ally had disintegrated castro declared 
castro told his listeners placards saying the best communist 
is a dead communist appeared in crowds during president bushs 
visit to poland they applauded when he called the sentiment 
fascist and said enemies should know that we communists 
wont let ourselves be killed easily 
it would serve young poles right he said if they had a chance 
to taste the egotistical brutal and inhuman capitalist system 
if communism collapses he said the united states and other 
imperialist powers will try to divide up the world and 
recolonialize it sharing out its resources and people among 
themselves 
more than an hour of his speech was devoted to reciting social 
and economic progress his revolution has brought the agricultural 
region around camaguey 300 miles east of havana 
the city was chosen as the site for his annual speech on the 
date in 1953 when he led an attack on a military barracks that 
began the guerrilla war dictator fulgencio batista fled the island 
on jan 1 1959 
castro opened his speech by lavishing praise on his listeners 
for their volunteer spirit and devotion to communist principles 
then launched his atack on the united states 
he accused bush of undertaking visits to poland and hungary more 
as a conquerer than a friend that prompted jay taylor the chief 
us envoy to cuba to walk out of the diplomatic section 
after making the comparison with nazi germany castro said the 
strike of soviet coal miners had filled the imperialists with 
joy and the collapse of the soviet union was an imperialist 
dream 
cuban officials had expected castro to comment on the corruption 
scandal that began last month and led to the execution of a 
decorated general and three other military officers two weeks ago 
for drug smuggling and other crimes 
in a plaza surrounded by billboards exhorting cubans to 
revolutionary rectitude their leader ignored the case

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
appeared set to win presidential elections friday and was reported 
to be already assembling a cabinet to govern the islamic republic 
in the postkhomeini era 
irans religious and political leaders thursday called for a big 
voter turnout to demonstrate unity following ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis death june 3 
but their exhortations also appeared aimed at securing a big 
vote of confidence in khomeinis heirs 
the official islamic republic news agency said millions of 
iranians are expected to vote in the presidential ballot and a 
national referendum on proposed constitutional amendments to give 
the presidency new powers khomeini urged the changes to eliminate 
competing power centers that have paralyzed the government 
officials said 26000 polling stations will open at 7 am they 
are scheduled to close at 5 pm but irna said they may stay open 
until midnight 
there was no word when results will be announced nor was there 
any official figure for irans electorate but it was estimated at 
25 million about half the population during parliamentary 
elections last year 
iranian leaders and the state media for days have been 
frantically exhorting iranians to vote to prove the nation is 
united behind the leadership 
each vote cast is a bullet fired at the heart of irans 
enemies the radical jomhuri islami daily stressed this week 
irans three grand ayatollahs or senior religious leaders 
joined the chorus thursday 
ayatollah mohammad ali araki said voting is a religious duty 
for every iranian 
but one disgruntled merchant who declined to be identified 
said why bother to vote rafsanjani has been part of the 
government for years and hes responsible with the other clerics 
for mess the economys in 
newspapers report unanimously that rafsanjani 55 is certain to 
become irans fourth president their polls predict he will win 86 
percent of the vote 
the only challenger is former agriculture minister abass 
sheibani 58 who is considered little more than a cosmetic 
candidate so that rafsanjani is not seen to be elected unopposed 
the elections were moved up from aug 18 to accelerate the 
transition of power following the death of khomeini who founded 
the fundamentalist republic in 1979 when he overthrew the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi 
incumbent president ali khameneis second fouryear term expires 
oct 5 and the ayatollah cannot run for a third term he was 
elected irans spiritual leader to succeed khomeini on june 4 
khamenei is allied with rafsanjani who heads the pragmatist 
faction they are expected to open up the economy which radicals 
have kept under tight reins and to build bridges with the west 
although that could take time 
rafsanjani appears so confident he has not bothered campaigning 
beyond a few interviews in which he stressed he will follow 
khomeinis path and make his top priority solving economic woes 
multiplied by the eightyear war with iraq 
there were few signs of electioneering in tehrans treelined 
avenues posters showing khomeini voting in last years 
parliamentary elections outnumbered those of rafsanjani reporters 
saw no posters of sheibani 
diplomatic sources say rafsanjani already has lined up a cabinet 
to include economists and technocrats some dumped from earlier 
administrations because of ideological and policy differences

the military services met their recruiting 
objectives for the first half of fiscal 1989 but the percentage of 
recruits with high school diplomas dropped slightly the pentagon 
said thursday 
recruiting and reenlistment results clearly show the 
services are experiencing a tougher recruiting climate david j 
berteau deputy assistant secretary of defense said in a statement 
some 90 percent of the recruits had high school diplomas 
compared with 92 percent in the same time period last year he said 
so far in the fiscal year that began oct 1 1988 64 percent of 
the enlistees had high school diplomas and scored in the top half 
on the armed forces aptitude test this is a decrease of 4 
percentage points from the same period in fiscal 1988 
quality trends reflect higher employment a shrinking youth 
population higher recruiting goals and declining value of 
recruiting incentives berteau said

security personnel who screen bags and 
passengers for us airlines will have to meet tougher standards 
under a plan adopted by airline security officials an industry 
spokesman said thursday 
security directors of major airlines approved new hiring and 
training standards for screening personnel after meetings at the 
air transport association headquarters this week said ata 
spokesman tim neale 
airlines are expected to follow the standards when contracts 
with security companies come up for renewal airlines either 
individually or in groups hire other companies to provide 
personnel who screen baggage and passengers at airport checkpoints 
ata estimates 10000 screening personnel work at about 1500 
security points in the nations airports 
the new guidelines require that workers be at least 18 years 
old high school graduates and englishspeaking us citizens and 
that they pass drug and aptitude tests and have no criminal 
convictions 
the plan also calls for a uniform training program for screening 
personnel who often earn little more than the minimum wage the 
training program and a program that will train trainers are being 
drawn up and will be ready by the end of the summer said neale 
the federal aviation administration has put increased pressure 
on airlines to improve security at airport checkpoints by imposing 
fines of up to 10000 when agents are able to smuggle through mock 
weapons the faa has levied more than 5 million in fines and says 
security has improved 
neale said the airlines conduct their own tests of the system 
and are proud of the high rate of detection 
a spokesman for one of the largest agencies which handles 
checkpoints at about 100 airports wackenhut of coral gables fla 
said the company supports the new standards although they may make 
it slightly harder to find qualified personnel 
the spokesman patrick cannan said industrywide standards are 
needed because companies with lower hiring requirements sometimes 
are able to underbid those with stricter standards 
he said wackenhut security personnel generally meet all the new 
requirements although sometimes exceptions are made for employees 
without high school degrees if they can pass tests that show 
equivalent knowledge and skills he said contracts with airlines 
likely would contain grandfather clauses that would retain 
nongraduates who meet other qualifications

soldiers captured one of the 
philippines most prominent communist leaders thursday and 
officials hailed the arrest as a major setback to the 20year 
marxist insurgency 
satur ocampo suspected member of the ruling politburo of the 
banned communist party of the philippines and head of the national 
democratic front was arrested with his commonlaw wife carolina 
malay in suburban makati the military said 
military officials said the two would be charged with 
subversion ocampo may also face murder and kidnapping charges in 
connection with the deaths of scores of rebels during a recent 
purge the military added 
ocampo and ms malay both 50yearold former journalists 
served as negotiators for the rebels during peace talks with 
president corazon aquinos government the talks collapsed in 
january 1987 
at a news conference after his arrest ocampo said he and ms 
malay were riding in their car when another vehicle cut them off 
three pistolwielding soldiers then jumped from the car and 
arrested them he said 
seeking to publicize arrests the military and law enforcement 
officials frequently allow those arrested in major cases to talk to 
the news media 
officials said troops had followed ocampo and ms malay as they 
left their home near the international school attended by children 
of foreign diplomats and businessmen the caretaker of the house 
said the two had been living there since may 3 
last week the military offered a 47600 reward for ocampo and 
23800 for ms malay military chief of staff gen renato de villa 
said a civilian informant helped in the arrests but he had no 
further details 
mrs aquino congratulated the military and hailed the captures 
as an outstanding feat she has vowed to crush the rebellion by 
the end of her term in 1992 
the capture is a breakthrough particularly in terms of 
further weakening the insurgency said deputy presidential 
spokesman noel tolentino 
as head of the national democratic front ocampo was in charge 
of the partys efforts to organize supporters among students 
farmers clerics teachers and others 
the front is an umbrella organization of 12 marxist groups 
including the communist party of the philippines and its armed 
wing the new peoples army 
ocampo was formerly assistant business editor of the manila 
times he was arrested for subversion in 1976 but fled in may 1985 
he was the countrys longestserving political prisoner at the time 
of his escape 
during the peace talks ocampo appeared on television and radio 
programs espousing the communist cause after a 60day ceasefire 
expired in february 1987 he gave frequent interviews and press 
statements on behalf of the rebels 
four days ago ocampo renewed offers of new peace talks if mrs 
aquino agreed to close the six us military bases here in 1991 
maj gen ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary 
said ocampos capture was the beginning of the end of the 
rebellion and would hamper the rebel propaganda campaign 
but ocampo said his arrest would have little effect on the 
insurgency 
the organization is a big one ocampo said previously 
supposed known leaders had also been captured this has not caused 
a big dent there is a long wide bench with responsible comrades 
who would take over 
the military claims to have captured about 10 central committee 
members since mrs aquino took power in 1986 although one of them 
romulo kintanar has since escaped 
the government justifies the continued hunt for communist rebels 
by saying they should have stopped subversive activities after 
democracy was restored with the ousting of president ferdinand 
marcos 
the movements base is in the impoverished rural areas where 70 
percent of the 58 million filipinos live 
government figures show that despite economic gains under mrs 
aquino the poorest third of filipino society controls only 9 
percent of the national income virtually no change from the final

a man who took the peoples court to the 
real thing has emerged victorious with a court commissioners order 
that the tv show pay him 1500 
our reaction is the same as some of the reactions of the 
people who walk out of our courtroom disbelief said phillip 
vandervort associate producer of the show 
louis degeorge 62 took peoples court to small claims 
court last week claiming he was misled when he agreed to appear on 
the show in february 
degeorge said he was told that despite whatever ruling 
peoples court judge joseph wapner made he would receive a 250 
appearance fee plus the 1500 in damages he was seeking from his 
former apartment house manager 
but peoples court policy is to guarantee damage payments 
only to litigants who win their cases vandervort argued 
wapner a retired superior court judge whose word is the law on 
the 8yearold tv show ruled in february that degeorge failed to 
prove that the apartment managers 11yearold son smashed a mirror 
on his pickup truck 
los angeles municipal court commissioner linda elliott ruled 
ralph edwards productions misrepresented its payment policy 
the show was ordered to pay the 1500 and degeorges 26 court 
costs 
i was elated said degeorge who learned of the ruling by 
mail tuesday they are big shots in the movie industry and 
television industry so this was really like david against 
goliath 
degeorge played for ms elliott a taped message left on his 
answering machine by a peoples court researcher richard 
velasquez 
velasquez who no longer works for the show promised a 
guaranteed 1500 as well as 250 if degeorge appeared on the 
show elliott ruled 
richard left out the words if you win vandervort said 
degeorges victory apparently will stand stewart billett 
executive producer of the show said there will be no appeal

a national service bill blending several 
democratic proposals should be on its way to the floor next week 
senators said thursday in announcing the compromise measure 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and 
human resources committee said at least 10 national service bills 
ranging in cost from 5 million to 5 billion have been introduced 
this year in the senate 
the 330 million democratic consensus package includes the 
best features of all the bills and the price tag is within 
realistic constraints he said 
the plan is designed to promote public service among americans 
of all ages with incentives including academic credit stipends 
job training educational aid and a helping hand for firsttime 
homebuyers 
kennedy said his committee is scheduled to complete work on the 
bill next week in preparation for floor action after the august 
recess 
moreover kennedy and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said they hope to achieve a bipartisan measure with bush 
administration support 
we will work with our republican colleagues our colleagues in 
the house and with the white house to pass national service 
legislation said mitchell 
bush favors a purely voluntary approach to such service without 
incentives or stipends and has proposed a 25 million program to 
encourage such efforts but kennedy and others suggested there may 
be some room for compromise as the bill moves through congress 
key elements of the senate package include 
100 million for schoolbased opportunities for young people to 
serve their communities and for aiding residents particularly the 
elderly in volunteering in schools 
100 million for fulltime or summer youth service corps 
programs modeled after the conservation corps already established 
in many states the programs would be open to youth aged 16 to 25 
with stipends of up to 6200 a year and postservice education and 
training benefits of up to 100 a week 
100 million for a civilian service program with education and 
housing vouchers ranging from 8500 a year for fulltime 
participants to 3000 a year for three to six years of parttime 
service fulltime participants also would receive a yearly stipend 
of 6200 to 7000 
10 million to expand the volunteers in service to america 
vista program 
20 million to expand volunteer programs for senior citizens 
under the older americans act 
the bill contains elements of proposals by sens kennedy sam 
nunn dga charles robb dva barbara mikulski dmd 
claiborne pell dri christopher dodd dconn bob graham 
dfla and daniel patrick moynihan dny 
nunn and robb are credited with sparking the national service 
debate with their proposal last january to make student financial 
aid contingent on a fulltime stint in military or community 
service their bill would have phased out current forms of student 
aid in five years 
nunn praised the consensus package thursday and said it could 
still lead to his goal of requiring national service in return for 
student aid i havent dropped my original thinking on the 
subject but i do think we ought to go slowly and determine what 
works he said 
democrats and republicans alike have criticized the idea of 
tying aid to service with many saying that doing so would penalize 
lowincome students while allowing the affluent to escape service 
obligations and proceed directly with their educations

the soviet union has appealed to turkey 
and bulgaria to negotiate a plan for handling an exodus of ethnic 
turks from bulgaria that soared to more than 200000 this week 
both sides basically agree to talks but there are hitches 
they must make efforts to close the distance said albert 
chernichev the soviet ambassador to turkey on his return 
wednesday from a fourth trip to moscow in the past month he is 
trying to mediate the dispute 
in may bulgaria began deporting ethnic turks in the wake of a 
government campaign that forced them to adopt slavic names 
restricted their moslem rites and banned use of the turkish 
language there are more than 1 million ethnic turks in bulgaria 
turkey has mobilized a huge effort to absorb the refugees 
housing thousands in tent camps and pressuring private employers to 
give them jobs despite a nationwide unemployment rate of 16 
percent 
earlier this week britain made a gesture to help turkey a nato 
ally by giving 492000 to ethnic turks and kurdish refugees from 
iraq 
the turkish foreign ministry said wednesday the influx had 
reached 202000 and showed no signs of slackening thousands have 
poured in day and night on foot as well as in cars and train some 
who walked across the border pulled carts with their possessions 
among those arriving wednesday was a world champion 
weightlifter erdinc kasimoglu the anatolia news agency reported 
a foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said turkey believed the dispute would not be solved 
easily even with the ambassadors help 
he is mediating but so far there is no change in the 
bulgarian position and we are unlikely to change ours the 
official said 
turkey is demanding that negotiations include an immigration 
agreement to protect the legal rights of the ethnic turks such as 
accumulated social security benefits and compensation for property 
left behind it also calls for restoration of minority rights for 
those who choose to remain in bulgaria 
bulgaria has been insisting on an open agenda 
the turks however say an open agenda would allow talks to drag 
on and detract world attention from the urgent problem 
the soviet union turkeys northern neighbor has been beset by 
its own ethnic problems it also has a large ethnic turkish 
population

carla southwell recalls vividly the 53 
days of sheer hell she spent in a jail cell for refusing to 
disclose the whereabouts of her two daughters who she says were 
sexually abused by her former husband 
nine months later with her contemptofcourt case under appeal 
shes back with her children but worried the reunion may be 
temporary 
a judge is expected to rule by years end whether ms southwell 
or her former husband william southwell should be granted 
permanent custody of the girls ages 5 and 6 
ms southwell acknowledges that her earlier defiance may work 
against her 
i cant even imagine my kids living with him it would destroy 
these girls she said recently sitting in her mobile home behind 
her parents rural home as it is i dont know that theyll ever 
fully recover 
ms southwell 27 speaks in a whisper at times as the girls 
fight over a barbie doll a few feet away tears well as she talks 
about the girls depression and the distant look they sometimes 
have 
the younger girl repeatedly sweeps her hand over her genital 
area a nervous response ms southwell attributes to the alleged 
molestations her sister who suffers from cystic fibrosis wears 
diapers to bed since she began bedwetting two years ago after the 
alleged abuse began 
the girls recently have begun seeing a counselor because they 
seem to need to talk about it and i dont know how to handle it 
said ms southwell who also has a 17monthold son by her fiance 
they plan to marry when the custody battle ends 
women have been jailed in several cities recently for contempt 
of court choosing to serve time rather than submt their children 
to what they believe i a sentence of abuse 
in the bestknown case elizabeth morgan a plastic surgeon has 
been jailed since august 1987 in the district of columbia for 
hiding her daughter from courtordered visits with her father 
congress is considering legislation that would set a cap on such 
jailings 
in the southwell case the girls indicated in a videotape for a 
custody hearing last year they had been molested and a doctor 
testified that at least one of the girls had injuries typical of 
child abuse 
an investigation of southwell 30 and his younger brother 
turned up no evidence of abuse said sgt ken kleinheksel of the 
kent county sheriffs department 
this is one of the toughest cases ive seen and i feel sorry 
for both sides kleinheksel said but as far as im concerned 
the case is closed 
southwell contends the girls were coached by their mother to 
make the allegations 
i would kill myself before i would sexually abuse those 
children southwell said wednesday as far as im concerned 
thats about the worst thing a person can do 
he said he has a strong relationship with the girls and is 
confident hell win custody they know their dad never hurt them 
and that i love them thats one thing carla cant take away when 
theyre here they ask if they can stay 
carla southwell was pregnant when the couple married in 1983 
less than two years later they were separated and they divorced 
in 1986 she contends southwell physically abused her during their 
marriage and that he didnt even know these kids existed he was 
never around 
she said her daughters told her in 1987 their uncle had sexually 
abused them on a visit to their fathers later the allegations 
included her former husband she said 
she began canceling visits and southwell went to court seeking 
permanent custody her request for supervised visitations was 
denied and a family services counselor told the court that unless 
southwell was granted custody he likely would never see the girls 
upon learning that custody might go to her former husband ms 
southwell fled with the girls found them a place to stay and 
returned to face court proceedings 
i knew i had to protect my daughters but i never felt that i 
should run away with them for good because i hadnt done anything 
wrong she said all i wanted was supervised visitation and him 
to get treatment 
kent county circuit judge george buth charged her with contempt 
of court and ordered her jailed sept 7 until she produced the 
children she was released oct 28 when the state court of appeals 
ordered a stay of the contempt ruling while the case is appealed 
since then southwell has agreed to supervised visitations until 
an independent evaluation of the girls is completed and the judge 
rules on custody

he was mentally incompetent when he pleaded guilty as a teenager 
to killing a liquor store clerk and asked for the death penalty 
clay county circuit judge glennon mcfarland refused wednesday to 
set aside the guilty plea and death sentence of heath wilkins who 
was 16 when he fatally stabbed nancy allen 26 during the july 
1985 robbery at a store in the kansas city area 
wilkins now 20 has other appeals left but this was his second 
court defeat in a month the us supreme court ruled june 26 that 
states can execute murderers who were 16 or 17 at the time of their 
crimes 
mcfarland ruled that wilkins was competent to plead guilty and 
request the death sentence he also said wilkins was not denied 
effective counsel and that none of his constitutional rights was 
violated he said testimony from medical experts for the defense 
was not persuasive 
public defender sean obrien said he was not surprised by the 
ruling and plans to appeal to the missouri court of appeals hes 
essentially saying its ok for the kid to pull his own plug he 
said 
prosecutor michael reardon said mcfarland had initially accepted 
the plea and he had the opportunity to observe wilkins and make 
his own determination 
he bent over backward to make sure wilkins rights were 
protected reardon said

governing party officials eager to shore up their 
battered party opened talks thursday on a successor for resigning 
prime minister sousuke uno and the partys no 2 official appeared 
to be a leading contender 
party secretary general ryutaro hashimoto appeared to have won 
the support of party leaders though some believed that at age 51 
he is too young to take the job while the party is in crisis one 
official said 
the liberal democratic party officials decided a replacement 
should be picked aug 8 at a caucus of party lawmakers and approved 
in a special session of parliament about aug 10 the partys 
choice is expected to win routine approval by parliament because 
the liberal democrats control the more powerful lower house 
however opposition party officials continued to oppose any 
early session of parliament they say they need time to work on a 
bill to abolish an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax 
the tax was a major issue in elections sunday for half the seats 
in the upper house of parliament it contributed to the liberal 
democrats loss of a majority in the chamber for the first time in 
their 34year history the party dropped 33 seats mostly to the 
leading opposition group the japan socialist party 
the liberal democrats have also struggled with charges that uno 
in office for less than two months had paid for sex with geishas 
he replaced prime minister noboru takeshita who announced his 
resignation april 25 to take responsibility for an influencebuying 
scandal that tainted much of the partys top leadership it took 
party leaders until june 2 to put uno in office partly because 
they had trouble finding someone untouched by the scandal 
uno announced monday he would resign to take responsibility for 
sundays election outcome 
leaders of the five main factions within the governing party 
began closeddoor meetings thursday to discuss a replacement 
despite a pledge wednesday by hashimoto that the process would be 
conducted openly 
critics have objected to earlier secret party deliberations to 
pick a prime minister 
hashimoto is the youngest person to fill the partys no 2 spot 
another possible candidate for prime minister is former deputy 
prime minister shin kanemaru 
leaders seem to be trying to build consensus within the party 
over hashimoto and i have not heard anyone express strong 
opposition so far said one party official speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
but at the same time he added party elders seem to think 
it is premature for the party to give its power to such a young 
politician in such a turbulent time 
hashimoto led the partys effort for sundays elections making 
90 speeches during the 14day campaign period he has said he also 
takes responsibility for sundays setback but he has not said 
anything about resigning 
the longgoverning conservative party is seeking a new leader to 
help restore public trust before lower house elections which must 
be held by july 1990 
meanwhile kanemaru said thursday the liberal democrats would 
face a terrible outcome in the lower house elections if the 
sales tax remains in effect news reports said 
the tax which applies to most purchases was forced through 
parliament by the governing party last year during an opposition 
boycott

under swedish registry and the mv greenpeace a 190foot vessel 
flying the dutch flag 
the monticivitano with seven people on board left fort pierce 
about 70 miles south of here the greenpeace with about 20 on 
board set off from daytona beach 60 miles to the north 
greenpeace member joel clement said the ships would not try to 
get close to the submarine or its support ships but will enter a 
zone of several square miles that is offlimits during the test 
the navy has said it plans to have the trident 2 operational and 
on sea patrol by next march the weapon has a range of 4600 miles 
and each can carry up to eight nuclear warheads 
the navy plans to develop a 21submarine force carrying trident 
2 missiles at a cost of about 155 billion over the vessels 
30year lifetime according to a report from the congressional 
general accounting office

the state bar says it wont charge assembly 
speaker willie brown with violating disciplinary rules for lawyers 
by contacting a judge about traffic tickets issued to a 
legislators daughter 
the bar said in a statement wednesday that it had closed its 
investigation on possible ethical misconduct by brown a democrat 
from san francisco 
the state bar concluded that there was an absence of 
compelling evidence on which to base a finding that brown had 
violated the provisions of the state bar act or the rules of 
professional conduct the bar said 
the investigation concerned reports that brown had asked for 
leniency when he called ventura county municipal court judge 
herbert curtis about the case of victoria wright daughter of 
assemblywoman cathie wright 
victoria wright ultimately was sentenced to 20 days in jail for 
traffic violations 
ventura county district attorney michael bradbury decided not to 
charge brown or the assemblywoman but sent a 75page report on the 
case to the bar and expressed disappointment at its reaction 
i guess they didnt want to bite the hand that feeds them 
bradbury said 
browns press secretary susan jetton said brown said from 
the beginning that he did not do anything wrong 
brown has been a california lawyer since 1959 and maintains an 
active practice

an immigration appeals panel ruled today that 
leftist writer margaret randall is an american citizen and 
therefore cannot be deported a decision that her lawyer said 
rebukes the immigration and naturalization service 
in a 32 decision the board of immigration appeals determined 
that the poet and author was forced by dire economic straits in 
1967 to take out mexican citizenship and never renounced her us 
citizenship freely 
attorneys for randall an outspoken critic of us policy who 
has lived 14 years in cuba and nicaragua said the ins was trying 
to punish her for her procommunist views the board was trying to 
determine whether she should be deported 
im absolutely thrilled of course and im especially happy 
because i feel the struggle that was felt by so many people over 
the last 4 years has borne some fruit randall said today at her 
home in albuquerque nm to tell you the truth im a little 
numb 
i think the decision affirms that us citizenship is a 
constitutional right and that one cannot lose ones citizenship 
because the government doesnt like what you say in your criticism 
of its policies said attorney david cole who represented 
randall on behalf of the new yorkbased center for constitutional 
rights 
its sort of a nice rebuke to the ins he said 
randall said she is sure the ins is glad a decision has been 
reached 
i havent seen the decision but my feeling about the ins is 
that i bear no individual any ill will and i really just feel this 
is something we all should feel happy we have behind us 
an ins spokesman duke austin said he had not seen the ruling 
and had no immediate comment 
we find that the respondent randall has established by a 
preponderance of the evidence that economic reasons led her to 
acquire mexican citizenship and that these economic reasons rose to 
the level of duress sufficient to negate her free choice the 
appeals board ruled 
the panel operates independently of the ins under the wing of 
the justice department 
according to records randall and her mexican husband separated 
in 1967 and she was left to support her three children because of 
mexicos work rules she had to take out mexican citizenship in 
order to find employment 
she told a state department employee two years later i did it 
because my children didnt have enough to eat and i felt i didnt 
have any other choice cole said in a telephone interview 
a supreme court decision at the time had held that actions such 
as taking an oath to another country joining a foreign army and 
holding an office in a foreign government were not necessarily 
proof that someone was renouncing us citizenship cole said 
you can only give it up if you want to he said 
after living in cuba and nicaragua randall returned to the 
united states in 1983 on a visitors visa when she was denied 
permanent resident alien status she appealed to the supreme court 
which last month refused to hear her case until the immigration 
appeal had been completed 
the ins had based the denial of resident status on randalls 
association with and her activities and writing in support of the 
communistdominated governments of cuba north vietnam and 
nicaragua it said those activities and writings go far beyond 
mere dissent 
randall has been living in albuquerque nm near her aging 
parents and taking a variety of teaching jobs

at a british electrical factory were locked out thursday and 
threatened with dismissal unless they dropped their demands for a 
25 percent wage increase 
the workers predominantly women of mixed race staged a protest 
outside the plessey co factory in diepriver a township near cape 
town 
most of the lockedout workers are members of the electrical and 
allied workers trade union and represent more than 80 percent of 
the production personnel at the plant the company has offered them 
a 17 percent wage increase and has threatened to fire them unless 
they accept the offer by aug 8 
union officials said they were angry because plessey implemented 
the lockout and issued the dismissal threat in terms of a recently 
passed labor law that has been opposed vehemently by antiapartheid 
trade unions 
we are outraged that a company that is part of the 
international community would make use if the regimes oppressive 
labor laws said union spokesman brian williams he said the 
workers would seek support from fellow union members in britain and 
elsewhere 
the average wage of union members employed by plessey is about 
315 a month according to union officials they said the companys 
customers include the south african armed forces

christian and syrian troops killed 28 
people and wounded 80 in a savage artillery battle that started 
hundreds of fires police said thursday four of the victims died 
when a rocket hit a home for the elderly 
it was the fiercest fighting and the worst toll since march 14 
when 39 people were killed and 96 wounded in beirut 
a police spokesman said casualties were higher in syrianpoliced 
west beirut where only a few neighborhoods escaped damage 
some suggested rightwing christian militias planned the 
bombardment 
one resident in the ashrafiyeh district that is the most 
damaged of the christian neighborhoods said lebanese forces 
militiamen toured east beirut shortly before shelling began late 
wednesday and urged people through loudspeakers to stay underground 
overnight 
it was strange because at the time they advised us to rush to 
shelters there was no shelling the resident said on condition of 
anonymity 
the police spokesman said it was impossible to determine who 
started the barrages 
but he noted it was the fiercest ever artillery attack waged 
by christian militiamen and mainly christian lebanese army troops 
commanded by gen michel aoun 
thursdays victims raised casualties to 481 killed and 1949 
wounded since the latest violence erupted march 8 after aoun 
blockaded illegal ports used by moslem militiamen syrian troops 
backed the moslems and have besieged the 310squaremile christian 
enclave betraying a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
in beirut on thursday 60 shells and rockets a minute rained 
down on some moslem areas 
five 122mm rockets blasted the fivestory home of the aged in 
west beiruts tarik jedideh district killing four inmates and 
wounding three 
victims were sprayed with shrapnel while they slept when the 
rockets blasted the firstfloor of the home said assistant manager 
azzam houri 
who would want to kill such helpless people a nurse cried 
when reporters toured bloodstained corridors of the home that 
houses 850 people it was a massacre she said 
military sources said aouns gunners mainly targeted syrian 
batteries along beaches in west beirut and in hills to the east and 
southeast but lebanese forces militiamen blasted residential 
neighborhoods indiscriminately 
the 6000member coalition of rightwing militias is commanded 
by samir geagea a maronite catholic like aoun who commands 20000 
troops 
geagea is aouns main rival in the christian camp but the two 
lately joined forces to drive syrias 40000 troops out of lebanon 
an aoun spokesman confirmed militiamen unleashed the random 
barrages 
our main problem now is how to control the lebanese forces 
their indiscriminate shelling is not serving our war of 
liberation against the syrians he said on condition of anonymity 
moslem radio stations also blamed the lebanese forces 
the popular voice of the nation appealed to those who control 
the machine of steel and fire to stop the massacre at any cost 
it said the lebanese forces pounded west beirut with 
phosphorous ammunition to plant fire and death wherever they 
explode 
tank fire mortars howitzers and multibarreled rocketlaunchers 
all were deployed the syrians and lebanese forces both used bm21 
rocketlaunchers that fire 40 projectiles a minute 
thuds from exploding rockets and artillery shells shook the 
capital and sent orange flames illuminating the sky of the city 
which was blacked out by power rationing 
shells tore gaping holes in apartment buildings triggering 
hundreds of fires that blazed out of control because the power 
outage left the fire brigade without water 
smoke billowed from gutted buildings debris and glass shards 
blanketed the streets some of the hundreds of smashed cars were 
reduced to piles of black twisted metal 
a weeping middleaged woman in west beirut called on god to 
punish the criminals who caused this catastrophe 
may allahs wrath fall on all the combatants they get paid to 
kill us or ruin our property she shouted a syrian soldier 
nearby watched her silently 
thursdays escalation followed a report from rabat morocco 
that the foreign ministers of morocco saudi arabia and algeria 
will meet saturday to review their failure to end lebanons 14year 
civil war

saudi financier adnan khashoggi left federal 
custody in a limousine today after his lawyer posted 10 million 
bail in an arrangement approved by an appeals judge over 
prosecutors objections 
i am pleased that the courts have granted me bail khashoggi 
said reading a handwritten statement outside the courthouse in 
manhattan where his lawyer gave a clerk two bank checks for 5 
million each i am anxious to work for my defense and look 
forward to clearing my name at trial 
khashoggi 54 will be allowed to live in his luxury apartment

president bush painted a rosy picture thursday 
of life on the farm telling future farmers there has never been a 
better time to launch a career in agriculture 
bush told more than 100 future farmers of america the growing 
global demand for farm products and a shift toward fewer government 
controls make their future bright 
for you our global economy means there has never been a 
better place nor more crucial time to start a career than in 
america today he said 
american farmers have pulled out of their crisis of four years 
ago the president told leaders of the 805000member farm 
organization at the white house 
this year farm income and agricultural exports are nearing 
record highs our surpluses of farm commodities have been 
drastically reduced and most of our good land has been brought back 
into production bush said and the farm credit situation has 
greatly improved over the last decade 
he added this progress has occurred while cutting the cost of 
federal farm programs in half for when the farm economy is strong 
and government has to pay less all america benefits 
you have told government to tear down the roadblocks of 
tariffs and trade barriers and said that the wave of the future 
lies in competition and free enterprise said bush 
in writing a new farm bill next year the president said 
these principles must be kept in mind in response to market 
forces producers must have more flexibility to decide what crops 
to grow 
he said the united states will keep pressing in talks on the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade for freer trade like the 
walls of jericho these barriers which distort world trade must 
come tumbling down he said 
ours is a global economy now and america must be able to 
compete said bush that will mean expanding ties with the soviet 
union already the third largest customer for us agricultural 
commodities and other countries he said 
bush said agricultural and environmental concerns must be seen 
as compatible both need clean safe and quality water 
the agriculture department says commodity price support programs 
this year are expected to cost 135 billion down from a peak of 
258 billion in fiscal 1986 
the peak year for farm exports was fiscal 1981 when us farm 
products fetched 438 billion this year it is expected to be 39 
billion up from 263 billion in fiscal 1986 
the net cash income of farmers this year is expected to range 
from 50 billion to 55 billion down from last years record high 
of 58 billion 
experts say income is down because farmers have brought more 
land back in production driving up their expenses also last year 
their income soared as the drought forced prices up and farmers 
rushed to market crops they had stored from previous years

the house judiciary committee today 
overwhelmingly approved a bill to ban flag burning after democrats 
elbowed aside republican demands for a constitutional amendment 
the committee approved the criminal statute 286 after chairman 
jack brooks dtexas promised to back a constitutional amendment 
if the legislation failed to overcome a supreme court ruling that 
flag burning was a protected form of free speech 
the democratic leadership intended to rush the bill to the house 
floor next week before the august recess in hopes of further 
calming demands for amending the constitution and of defusing the 
issue 
however parliamentary objections today by republicans forced a 
delay in floor action until after the house returns in september 
the statute provides penalties of up to a year in jail plus a 
fine the amount of which is not specified for anyone who burns or 
otherwise physically desecrates a flag 
in a sometimes raucus meeting brooks ruled out of order the 
second republican attempt in two days to substitute a 
constitutional amendment for the regular statute supported by the 
democratic leadership 
this statute is a mess and its obvious its a mess from 
everything weve seen and heard this morning said rep chuck 
douglas rnh 
douglas offered several amendments designed to derail the 
statute including a modified version of the constitutional 
amendment supported by president bush and house minority leader bob 
michel rill 
although other republicans supported his amendments douglas was 
the only one who voted against the statute 
five democrats leery of any infringement of free speech voted 
against it including rep john conyers of michigan who offered an 
amendment of his own to ban cross burnings 
cross burnings for centuries have been more of a problem in 
the united states than flag burnings said conyers who was also 
ruled out of order by brooks 
democratic leaders have made clear they intend to allow passage 
only of a statute before the august recess 
as a matter of prudence and principle we must try the 
statutory route before tampering with the first amendment said 
rep don edwards dcalif as the committee on wednesday opened 
consideration of the flag bill 
rep hamilton fish rny appealed to the democrats to give 
republicans a chance to offer amendments to the bill when it 
reaches the full house probably next week brooks indicated 
however that the bill will be brought up under an expedited 
procedure that blocks any amendments 
bush effectively used the flag against the democratic nominee 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis in last years presidential 
election 
since then democrats have been running scared whenever the 
question of the flag has been raised said rep george crockett 
dmich a committee member who agrees with the supreme court 
decision that flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of 
political protest 
although most lawmakers of both parties condemned the ruling 
bush set the political battle lines in congress when he embraced 
the constitutional amendment at a ceremony at the iwo jima memorial 
by passing a statute before the august recess house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash hopes democrats can take care of the flag 
and cool the rush for a constitutional amendment 
foley and the other top democrats contend the statute introduced 
by brooks can pass constitutional muster because it does not take 
into account whether the flag burning or other mutilation was part 
of a protest or similar act 
the court in its 54 ruling specifically objected to a texas 
statute that outlawed flag burning when it was an offensive act 
the brooks bill makes an exception so that veterans groups and 
others can continue to dispose of old wornout flags for which 
burning is the traditional method 
the bill also provides for the law to get expedited review by 
the supreme court 
the senate has scheduled votes on both the amendment and a 
statute in october

elks club members from around the nation 
voted today against allowing women to join their fraternal 
organization but in favor of a membership rule that could make it 
easer for nonwhite men to join 
the proposal to admit women was one of the hottest issues at the 
125th national convention of the 15 millionmember benevolent and 
protective order of elks which began sunday and ends today 
during a closed business meeting the delegates took up a 
resolution to strike the word male from membership requirements 
donald dapelo the newly installed grand exalted ruler of the 
elks said the vote was by a show of hands and there was no count 
i wouldnt say it was close not at all said dapelo id 
say it was overwhelmingly defeated 
approved was the proposal to eliminate a rule allowing any three 
members of an elks lodge to reject or blackball a prospective 
member some said that rule made it harder for blacks to join the 
organization 
under the new rule a twothirds majority of a lodges members 
could approve a new member 
in st george utah a woman who was rejected for elks 
membership filed a sex discrimination lawsuit in 1987 that is still 
pending

criticism during the february 1988 confirmation hearings for 
stephen m reasoner of jonesboro ark now a federal judge said 
retired air force lt col hal detrick of jonesboro in submitting 
the resolution 
reasoner resigned from the elks and masonic lodges after sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio accused the organizations of 
discriminating against women and blacks

rule was urged by the lompoc calif elks lodge after two black 
applicants were rejected the california attorney generals office 
is investigating possible civil rights violations as a result of 
that vote

the federal government could collect billions 
of dollars in unpaid taxes if it had the staff to audit 
upperincome americans who account for a disproportionate share of 
tax evasion says a study sponsored by a democratic group 
people who earn more than 50000 a year 12 percent of all 
taxpayers owed 40 percent of the 725 billion in taxes that were 
owed to the government in 1985 but not collected said the study 
which was based on data from the internal revenue service 
the top 3 percent of taxpayers those who make more than 
100000 a year accounted for 26 percent of the unpaid taxes the 
study said it was financed by leadership for the new century a 
group of progressive democrats

a threat to cancel the f14d jet fighter and 
v22 osprey tiltrotor plane disappeared today as a key house 
opponent bowed to strong political support and withdrew a proposal 
to scuttle the military aircraft programs 
rep william dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the 
house armed services committee pulled a proposed amendment to a 
defense authorization bill that would have eliminated the f14d 
the fighter nicknamed the tomcat is strongly backed by 
lawmakers from new york where it is manufactured by grumman 
aerospace corp 
new york reps norman lent raymond mcgrath and david martin 
succeeded in persuading dickinson to withdraw the provision 
according to new york democrat george hochbrueckner a former 
grumman engineer 
its clear we had the votes but we didnt want to test that 
hochbrueckner said let the amendment die 
dickinson also decided not to introduce an amendment canceling 
the marine corps osprey a transport aircraft that takes off like a 
helicopter but can fly like a plane it has the support of members 
from pennsylvania and texas where the v22 is built as well as 
former marines in congress 
defense secretary dick cheney has sought to scrap both aircraft 
projects as a moneysaving step 
but the house armed services committee voted last month to 
restore 157 million for the osprey in fiscal 1990 and about 230 
million for the tomcat 
earlier today the house voted to urge president bush to open 
negotiations with the soviet union aimed at banning the production 
of plutonium and enriched uranium the materials used in nuclear 
weapons 
the vote for the nonbinding resolution attached to the defense 
authorization bill was 284138 
supporters of the amendment said such negotiations are a logical 
and needed next step in the arms control process 
but opponents said such a ban would be impossible to verify and 
would put the united states at a serious disadvantage because it 
has no currently operating nuclear enrichment production plants 
while the soviet union has 12 to 14 going at full blast 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee said the talks could resolve an tremendous 
imbalance in which the soviets are adding to their nuclear 
stockpile while us production stands at zero 
this is an effort to get us on the negotiating track and deal 
with this problem if possible he said this is an expression 
of congress saying mr president see what you can do 
rep bob walker rpa replied that the bush administration 
opposes the measure and that us arms negotiators are against it 
because an agreement could not be verified 
lets not do something stupid walker said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said he worried that congress might with such 
suggestions overload the arms control agenda 
the house voted wednesday to curb production of the 
radarevading stealth bomber program but cheney expressed relief 
the chamber had not killed the 70 billion program outright 
cheney said the white house hopes a house conference with the 
senate to resolve differences in the two chambers versions of the 
295 billion defense authorization bill will remove the roadblocks 
and permit a fast start for production of the costly bomber 
they the administration have in effect a year to 
restructure the program to prove through tests its worth 
buying aspin told reporters its the core of the argument we 
dont know enough right now to make a decision 
the aspin amendment would require the pentagon to meet rigid 
test and performance standards before additional stealth bombers 
are purchased it would limit to two the number of bombers to be 
purchased over the next two fiscal years 
the administration suffered an unwanted budget cut wednesday 
when the house approved an amendment to reduce by 502 million the 
11 billion earmarked for spare mx missiles and for a rail system 
bush requested to make the mx a mobile system the 224197 vote 
does not affect the nearly 800 million earmarked for the missiles 
themselves 
the senate voting 981 on tuesday endorsed president bushs 
twoyear request for 47 billion for stealth production 
conditioned on the aircraft meeting flighttest and radarevasion 
standards 
before adopting the aspin amendment the house defeated a 
proposal to eliminate the program outright

counterintelligence sources contend 
soviet bloc espionage is on the increase in west germany despite 
warming eastwest relations and closer ties between the kremlin and 
this frontline nato nation 
there was a sharp jump in the espionage activities of the 
warsaw pact nations in 1988 and we have every reason to suspect 
that it will increase said hansgert lange a spokesman for the 
colognebased constitutional protection office that is west 
germanys counterintelligence agency 
west germany especially west berlin has been an espionage 
hotbed since the advent of the cold war 
for more than four decades the divided city has been the scene 
of legendary intrigue and furtive spy swaps at the berlin wall the 
demarcation line between east and west 
bonn also is a mecca for espionage operations and the capital 
on the rhine river frequently is rocked by spy scandals 
a former government secretary was convicted in may on charges of 
delivering sensitive information to east german intelligence and 
the soviet kgb 
the constitutional protection office has suffered its own 
scandals hansjoachim tiedge a senior counterintelligence 
official in charge of tracking down east german spies defected to 
east germany in 1985 
in 1974 former chancellor willy brandt was forced to resign 
after a top aide guenter guillaume was exposed as an east bloc 
agent 
west german officials currently are investigating whether senior 
us diplomat felix s bloch was involved in espionage when he held 
posts in west germany in the 1960s and east and west berlin in the 
1970s 
he reportedly was filmed by us officials earlier this year 
passing a briefcase to a soviet kgb agent in a european capital 
security officials in bonn speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the the threat of espionage activity has increased since the 
soviet union and other east bloc countries have allowed tens of 
thousands of people to emigrate to the west 
lange said hightech industry also is increasingly a target of 
east bloc espionage activities to get around bans on sales of 
sophisticated equipment to the soviet bloc the soviet union and 
its warsaw pact allies need an infusion of technology to help turn 
around their failing economies 
lange and other security officials say evidence is mounting that 
east bloc agents increasingly are being channeled into west germany 
among emigres 
there is a definite trend here although the vast majority of 
them emigres are not involved said lange 
he said there is evidence that intelligence officials in east 
germany czechoslovakia romania poland and the soviet union are 
stepping up efforts to recruit spies among those who have applied 
to come to the west 
intelligencegathering can range from collecting train and bus 
timetables to delivering secret protocols from the highest levels 
of the west german government 
a recent report compiled by the constitutional protection office 
provided rare details about east bloc espionage activities 
release of the report suggests counterintelligence officials 
fear west germans have become too complacent about the continuing 
danger of espionage in the wake of improved ties with the east 
ethnic germans who request to leave are clearly told that the 
key to receiving an exit visa is to agree to cooperate the 
report said 
but it said romanian officials are among the most rigorous 
in efforts to force wouldbe emigres to spy 
the report said that while east bloc intelligence agencies are 
interested in all facets of life in west germany most espionage 
activities are directed at military installations government 
offices and private industry 
west german visitors to the east sometimes are approached to 
carry out such operations the report said 
nato troop movements remain of special interest 
american facilities are given special attention the report 
said adding that authorities had arrested one west german who had 
spied for more than 30 years on field maneuvers of the western 
alliance 
american servicemen also have been caught spying for the east 
lange and other security officials say they are giving priority 
to ferreting out east bloc agents who eventually could work their 
way into sensitive government and industry posts 
you have to be alert for the longterm problem lange said 
these people east bloc spies have endless patience

a career criminal who haunted the 
streets of stockholm in search of drugs and drink was convicted 
thursday of murdering prime minister olof palme in 1986 and was 
sentenced to life in prison 
carl gustav christer pettersson was found guilty by a stockholm 
district court panel of two professional judges and six lay jurors 
the two judges said there was not enough evidence to convict 
pettersson but they were outvoted by the lay jurors a simple 
majority was needed for conviction 
petterssons attorney said he would appeal 
the laymen accepted the testimony of lisbeth palme who 
testified that she saw pettersson 42 standing near her husband 
moments after he was shot in the back at close range while walking 
home from a late movie on feb 28 1986 
an architect of swedens modern welfare state palme had been in 
his fourth term as prime minister he cultivated a reputation as an 
international peacemaker 
his death shocked many swedes into the realization their 
peaceful country was not immune to violence 
in the years after the shooting police looked for an 
international conspiracy in an investigation marred by public 
squabbles and frustrations 
three police chiefs and one justice minister resigned under 
pressure no one claimed the 8 million reward that was offered for 
information leading to a conviction 
instead routine police work led to the verdict pettersson an 
admitted abuser of amphetamines and alcohol was questioned 
immediately after the slaying but released because he had an alibi 
a new team of investigators sifting through previous 
statements found holes in his story and he was arrested dec 14 
the trial began june 5 
pettersson was also convicted of endangering the life of mrs 
palme who was grazed by a bullet 
however the reservations of judges carlanton spak and mikael 
af geijerstam laid grounds for an appeal that could work in favor 
of pettersson who has maintained his innocence 
the murder weapon was never found neither mrs palme nor any 
other witness testified to seeing pettersson with a gun in his 
hand no motive was established 
there might be grounds maybe good grounds for a reversal in 
appellate court defense attorney arne liljeros told swedish radio 
he called the decision a halfway victory the appellate court 
is made up solely of judges 
in the 46page decision the district court said mrs palme 
with great certainty identified pettersson as the man she saw 
directly after her husband fell to the ground 
the way she identified him at the trial is according to the 
court very convincing it said 
pettersson testified that he was 18 miles away at a suburban 
train station when palme was shot on a downtown street corner one 
witness supported his testimony others disputed it 
pettersson said he had left his suburban home to buy 
amphetamines but was on the way home when palme was killed 
i was a bum he told the court i belonged to the ateam 
a derisive label for drunks who sleep in parks and churchyards 
i am a killer but not a murderer he said i did not kill 
prime minister olof palme 
pettersson was convicted of manslaughter in a fatal stabbing in 
1970 near the spot where palme was killed 
since the age of 19 pettersson has been convicted of more than 
60 crimes mostly assault and theft 
professional jurists spak and geijerstam cast doubt on the 
testimony of mrs palme and others at the scene they also pointed 
to the lack of a motive 
the possibility of a mistake must be considerable the 
judges said in their dissenting opinion 
we think that the factor of uncertainty is so prominent that 
we cant vote to convict geijerstam told reporters after the 
verdict was announced 
under swedish practice lay jurors are selected from a pool of 
citizens put forward by the countrys political parties in this 
case there were two social democrats one member of the moderate 
party one from the center party one liberal and one communist 
they and the judges had equal votes

cambodias government and three resistance groups 
ended a threeday standoff thursday by agreeing on seating 
arrangements at an international conference on cambodia french 
officials said 
officials of the four cambodian factions agreed to the 
compromise at a meeting at the french foreign ministry a ministry 
spokesman said speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with 
departmental practice 
a solution had been sought since tuesday when talks between 
prime minister hun sen and the three resistance leaders prince 
norodom sihanouk khieu samphan of the khmer rouge and son sann of 
the noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front broke 
off over the issue 
hun sen rejected sihanouks proposal for one joint cambodian 
delegation while sihanouk would not accept hun sens proposal for 
two delegations one for hun sens vietnamesebacked government 
and one grouping the three rebel organizations 
under the compromise cambodia will be one entity listed 
alphabetically between brunei and canada but with four 
subdelegations with the factions seated in alphabetical order of 
their groups names 
the foreign ministry spokesman said there were no plans for the 
cambodian leaders to meet again before the international conference 
opens sunday with representatives from nearly 20 countries 
including secretary of state james baker and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
china vietnam britain india indonesia and thailand are among 
the other countries attending the conference which will try to 
come up with a comprehensive peace package 
among proposals is sending monitors to confirm the withdrawal of 
vietnams troops which hun sen has promised will be complete by 
sept 27 sihanouk claims tens of thousands of vietnamese are now 
disguised as cambodian soldiers 
also to be considered is international supervision of elections 
to be held in cambodia possibly after formation of an interim 
government that would have representatives of the resistance as 
well as hun sens government 
a key issue is whether to let the khmer rouge participate in an 
interim government hun sen rejects the idea saying the people 
responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths before they were 
ousted by a vietnamese invasion in december 1978 should not be 
trusted to share power 
sihanouk argues that the chinesebacked khmer rouge the 
strongest of the guerrilla factions would continue to fight if 
shut out of the government thus ensuring continued strife in a 
country that has suffered horribly for two decades 
hun sen has proposed an early ceasefire which sihanouk says 
can come only with a complete agreement in the past week fighting 
has intensified between hun sens troops and the guerrilla groups 
before the seating dispute was resolved hun sen met thursday 
morning with premier michel rocard hun sen told reporters he had a 
good conversation with rocard and described the meeting as 
important without offering details 
france recognizes neither the vietnameseinstalled government of 
hun sen nor the exile coalition government of democratic kampuchea 
over which sihanouk presides 
the sovietbacked vietnamese maintained about 100000 troops in 
cambodia for several years but they have been gradually reduced in 
preparation for the sept 27 withdrawal date 
the armed strength of the resistance is generally estimated at 
more than 30000 for the khmer rouge 12000 for the khmer peoples 
national liberation front and 5000 for the sihanoukists 
the khmer rouge were in power in cambodia in 19751978 during 
that time hundreds of thousands of cambodias 8 million people 
died from khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest

a bill designed to spur research into the 
threat of global climate change drew a warm response thursday from 
a wide range of scientists 
the proposal represents a major step forward in coordinating 
an effective scientific response to the pressing concerns of global 
change reported william r moomaw of the world resources 
institute 
thomas f malone of the holcomb research institute termed the 
measure the single most important legislative proposal to have 
been made concerning climate change 
j christopher bernabo of science and policy associates inc 
called the bill an important contribution toward establishing a 
successful research and assessment program on global change 
the proposal drawing these and a flood of other laudatory 
comments seeks to organize efforts to understand how human 
activities have changed the climate and threaten future changes 
the comments came in testimony prepared for a joint hearing of 
the house science space and technology subcommittees on natural 
resources and international scientific cooperation 
the panels are considering a bill to increase the authority of 
the federal committee on earth science putting that group in 
charge of coordinating climate change research being conducted 
several federal agencies 
the primary aim will be studies of the damage done to the 
earths protective ozone layer and by the threatened warming of the 
planet as a result of the socalled greenhouse effect 
scientists have grown increasingly concerned about damage to the 
ozone layer in the stratosphere which blocks most of the suns 
ultraviolet radiation chemicals produced by industry could damage 
this layer leading to an increase in skin cancer and damage to 
crops and animal life 
in addition scientists and environmentalists worry about the 
possibility of climate warming changing crop growth patterns 
melting the polar ice caps and changing the weather 
chemicals in the atmosphere notably carbon dioxide can trap 
warmth from the sun that would otherwise radiate back out into 
space this process is not well understood but many fear that as 
a greenhouse can overheat the plants inside it would lead to 
overheating of the earth 
human activities may have set irreversible and undesirable 
global changes into motion warned rep james scheuer dny 
as stewards of the planet we must step up improve and better 
coordinate our scientific research efforts so that meaningful 
preventive actions can be implemented 
under the bill the committee on earth science would be given 
authority to organize a global change research and assessment 
programs and eliminate duplication between government agencies 
efforts would also be made to coordinate the work with foreign 
countries and the united nations 
dallas peck of the us geological survey serves as chairman of 
the committee on earth science participants include the national 
science foundation department of transportation national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration department of energy defense 
department national aeronautics and space administration 
environmental protection agency department of agriculture state

the biblereading criminal convicted of 
killing prime minister olof palme admitted he abused alcohol took 
drugs and even killed a man but didnt shoot palme 
i was a bum carl gustav christer pettersson said as his 
fiveweek trial opened june 5 its actually surprising that 
anyone at all has anything positive to say about me 
pettersson convicted and sentenced to life in prison thursday 
is a veteran of one of the worlds most lenient penal systems 
where early releases are routine his criminal record lists more 
than 60 crimes most of them petty theft and assault one for 
manslaughter 
but the 42yearold unemployed loner maintained he was innocent 
of shooting palme on feb 28 1986 his lawyer said he would appeal 
the conviction 
i am a killer but not a murderer pettersson had told the 
court 
the trial disclosed a life of drug use alcohol abuse and petty 
crime it exposed the complex character of a biblereading man who 
liked children wrote poetry and scared friends with his erratic 
violent behavior 
pettersson was born into a middleclass family on april 23 
1947 a promising child he read homer at the age of 10 and had no 
evident problems in school until suffering a concussion as a 
teenager 
at 19 he started taking drugs his life took a criminal turn 
and developed into a roller coaster of euphoria jails and mental 
hospitals 
pettersson studied acting in the 1960s but dropped out of 
acting school after being accused of theft 
there were conflicting accounts of his political views or of 
whether he had any 
during the trial he described himself as an admirer of palme 
the fourterm prime minister was a champion of social democratic 
causes and a leading architect of swedens welfare state 
after the slaying pettersson signed several public letters of 
condolence 
however friends testified that pettersson bore a deep hatred 
toward swedens highly structured society where drugs are not 
tolerated and drinking is officially discouraged 
newspapers speculated that he developed a hatred for palme in 
1980 after contacts in jail with a rightwing extremist 
in 1970 pettersson escaped from a mental hospital got into an 
argument with a stranger and killed him with a bayonet 
the slaying occurred close to where palme was gunned down 16 
years later evidence at the time indicated that pettersson fled 
the scene down a small side street the same one taken by palmes 
killer 
pettersson was convicted of manslaughter held in a psychiatric 
ward and released after seven months 
he was arrested for the palme slaying in december 1988

ray croteau while he was plowing fields in alberta canada he 
wasnt frightened he was exhilarated 
that was 53 years ago today croteau lets his horses get away 
from him almost every night of the week 
croteau along with several other canadians and their families 
race chuckwagons behind teams of four thoroughbred race horses in 
thunderous competition a favorite of spectators this week at 
cheyenne frontier days 
you dont really appreciate it until they wreck an onlooker 
said they take their lives into their own hands 
but to croteau 61 i dont think its any more dangerous than 
driving down the road 
the roar of the crowd matches the rumble of the wagons as the 
four teams race astride with only about two feet separating each 
team from the next the flinch of the drivers wrist can make the 
difference to life and limb 
the first chuckwagon races began during the cattle drives of the 
19th century 
after a long day theyd have a race to the first town or 
tavern theyd throw the stove in the wagon and go croteau said 
true to the tradition a stove actually a small keg barrel 
is ceremoniously tossed into the back of the modernday chuckwagons 
as part of the race if the stove falls out a foursecond penalty

a senate panel angry over exxons handling of 
the alaskan oil spill approved legislation thursday to give the 
federal government a much greater role in such cleanups and to 
establish a 1 billion industryfinanced fund to pay for the work 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine predicted quick 
action by the full senate next week on the bill which would put 
the president in charge of spills immediately while potentially 
limiting the cost to oil companies for damages 
members of the senate environment and public works committee 
said exxons recent confirmation that it would pull cleanup crews 
out of alaskas prince william sound sept 15 spurred them to quick 
action 
this outrageous decision could not happen once this bill 
is passed said sen joseph lieberman dconn 
the voice vote approval shows indignation with the fact that 
exxon has apparently decided its had enough and is in fact 
quitting said sen frank lautenberg dnj 
on tuesday a day after word leaked out that exxon would pull 
its cleanup crews out the company said it was not ruling out a 
resumption of the cleanup next spring transportation secretary 
samuel skinner said that in fact little could be done to clean 
affected areas during cold weather 
exxon has been criticized for a slow response to the march 24 
grounding of the tanker valdez which poured some 11 million 
gallons of alaskan crude into prince william sound 
the oil company estimates it has spent about 125 billion to 
clean the wilderness area but state officials believe only about 
onethird of the needed work has been completed alaskas governor 
steve cowper and transportation secretary samuel skinner said they 
expect exxons crews to remain until the job is done 
under the senate measure the federal government would become 
responsible for cleanup action as soon as an oil spill happens the 
president would have authority to order a company to remain at a 
cleanup site and could call in federal authorities if the work is 
not adequate 
another provision would set up regional response teams to have 
cleanup crews with equipment for handling spills close at hand a 
response to complaints that exxon had to send thousands of miles 
for the right equipment to remove oil from the sound 
the government would draw on a 1 billion emergency fund paid 
for by the a fee charged oil companies to pay for a cleanup 
but the measure would also cap a companys financial liability 
for most spills at 500 per gross ton far less than exxon has paid 
for the alaska spill unless the company showed gross and 
wilfull negligence 
mitchell who wrote the original bill admitted the cap might 
also limit companies financial incentive to avoid spills but told 
members it was needed to keep insurance costs from skyrocketing 
large sums of money would be immediately available through the 
industry fund without the need for years of litigation said 
mitchell the benefits outweigh the disadvantages 
an official with the arco oil co told the committee last week 
the company supports giving the federal government sole 
responsibility for oilspill cleanups 
mitchell said other senate committees must still approve 
portions of the bill that concern revenues but he expects a vote 
by the senate before the august congressional recess begins next 
week 
the fasttrack approach could make the bill law by the fall 
a similar measure has been passed by the house merchant marine 
and fisheries committee and the house public works and 
transportation committee is also scheduled to consider that measure 
next week

indians say life on the st regis mohawk 
reservation has become like living behind the iron curtain because 
of a weeklong standoff between police and a militant faction 
its way out of proportion now said birdie johnson one of 
about 4500 residents of the reservation straddling the 
uscanadian border in northern new york its like living in a 
communist country 
the standoff has existed on the 14460acre reservation since 
state troopers and fbi agents raided the territorys seven illegal 
gambling casinos july 20 the second raid in as many months 
thirteen arrests were made 
in response an unofficial band of heavily armed warriors 
claiming to be a security force erected roadblocks to keep the 
police from returning and state police set up roadblocks outside 
the reservation 
we cant go anywhere people are staying in their homes we 
are in a state of occupation and police have effectively sealed the 
reservation off said doug george editor of the reservation 
newspaper akwesasne notes 
until monday state police blocked everyone except residents 
from entering the reservation theyve relaxed those restrictions 
somewhat this week allowing in vehicles carrying food medicine 
and other supplies 
but nonresidents with no business on the reservation are still 
prohibited from entering 
it is my opinion that the situation is not such that there 
is any type of assurance that the public would be safe said 
state police maj ronald brooks 
because police were prevented from entering the reservation 
they would be unable to assist stranded motorists and emergency 
crews would be helpless in responding to accidents said state 
police sgt michael downs 
authorities also are concerned about alcohol guns ammunition 
explosives and undesirables getting onto the reservation he 
said 
inside the reservation is patrolled by the militant warrior 
group which calls itself the mohawk sovereignty security force it 
is not recognized by tribal leaders 
members of that group have vowed not to disband until the 
troopers leave state police say they arent going anywhere until 
the militant faction disperses 
the standoff has disrupted or closed most reservation businesses 
and led to the cancellation of summer school and tribal leaders 
have met daily to try to find a solution 
the community is divided over the gambling many view it as a 
form of economic development and angered by both the continued 
police presence and occupation by the renegade indian group 
this will split the community for many years the division is 
long and hard and wont mend itself for a long time said former 
chief brenda lafrance 
although there is strong support for mohawk sovereignty there 
appears to be only a small group willing to back the warrior 
factions stand against police 
if the majority of the community has a choice between the 
security force and the police patrols theyre going to want the 
police said chief harold tarbell 
one of the difficulties in reaching a solution is that tribal 
leaders are hesitant to involve security force representatives in 
the process said george 
weve tried to get the force to disband but they wont they 
are like the plo palestine liberation organization they are 
there and they are a factor but to involve them in negotiations is 
to legitimize them he said

nissan employees rejection of the 
united auto workers in smyrna is a sign that american workers want 
cooperation not conflict with management an industry analyst 
said thursday 
nissan workers voted 1622711 wednesday and thursday to keep 
the union out the plant is one of three fully japaneseowned auto 
plants in the united states none is organized by the united auto 
workers 
workers who embraced japanesestyle participatory management at 
nissan feared the union would mean a return to the adversarial 
labor relations of the past said david cole an industry expert at 
the university of michigan 
the liveinthepast movement in particular has been given a 
very sharp blow in fact theyre dead in the water said cole 
director of the office for study of automotive transportation at 
the universitys transportation research institute 
other analysts said the nissan vote proves japanese automakers 
can shut out the uaw as long as workers are well paid 
a uaw faction called new directions wants the union to turn away 
from cooperativestyle agreements these workers in smyrna saw 
the significant battle in the new directions movement and that was 
a turnoff for them cole said 
cole said the vote does not spell doom for the uaw but that the 
union is not going to regain its dominant role in the industry any 
time soon 
organized labor is different today from organized labor of 20 
30 years ago he said it has a harmonious relationship with 
management and realizes international competition 
nissans management style gives workers a say in production and 
organizes the shop floor into teams whose members rotate tasks as 
frequently as every two hours 
wages at the plant range from 1110 to 1574 an hour plus 
145anhour guaranteed bonuses other bonuses are tied to quality 
and financial performance although that is slightly below wage 
rates at uaw plants the cost of living is low in central tennessee 
it looks as if the japaneseowned plants are going to stay 
nonunion david healey an analyst for drexel burnham lambert in 
new york said thursday 
the uaw organizing campaign had charged that production 
speedups at smyrna were causing a high number of injuries 
but healey said as long as the japaneseowned plants pay the 
same wages as the unionized plants the workers arent going to 
vote for the union i dont think the union proved its case with 
the plant workers there bottom line they didnt believe theres 
serious safety problems and fast line speeds inside the plant 
uaw organizer ben perkins said the union sees the rejection 
just like any other defeat 
we lost the battle because of an intensive nonunion camp that 
was begun when the plant was first built he said thursday on 
nbcs today show he said that the work force of 2400 was 
hired out of 130000 applicants 
for the last six years they have received doses of antiunion 
propaganda over a closedcircuit tv system inside the plant 
perkins said in addition in the last week of the campaign they 
were bombarded with threats and intimidation loss of benefits if 
they chose to join the union 
a professor on labor relations at cornell university harry 
katz said the fight had tarnished japanese industrys reputation 
management wins in the short run but did they win in the long 
run he asked i think the irony here is that the japanese 
with this reputation of consensus decisionmaking and little overt 
conflict are the ones who end up in a very bitter adversarial 
battle not only with the union but with their own work force 
in contrast vanderbilt university sociologist daniel cornfield 
called the defeat a crack in the wall at the uaw even though 
only 2400 potential members were at stake 
for the first time if 50 years theres a small but 
established pocket of nonunion production in the united states 
he said

huds new york regional administrator was 
hired as the chief executive of a real estate firm in january 1988 
after years of making housing recommendations that earned the 
company millions of dollars records and published reports show 
joseph d monticciolo left the department of housing and urban 
development to become board chairman and chief executive of eagle 
capital group a manhattanbased investment firm whose partners 
include wealthy developer sheldon goldstein monticciolo is paid 
125000 a year the companys lawyer told newsday 
government records and recent published reports reveal that as 
hud administrator monticciolo made recommendations to his 
superiors that directly benefitted goldsteins real estate 
companies most members of eagle were also reportedly part of a 
goldsteinled investment group that bought seven housing projects 
from hud in 1983 putting up only 550000 cash and sold them 
three years later at an estimated 17 million profit 
monticciolo a 51yearold architect from woodbury ny is 
scheduled to testify friday before the house subcommittee 
investigating alleged abuses at hud 
neither monticciolo nor goldstein could be reached for comment 
thursday a woman answering the phone at eagle capital said both 
men were out monticciolos fatherinlaw michael fazio said 
monticciolo was meeting with his lawyer 
asked whether monticciolo would invoke his fifth amendment 
rights friday fazio said i wont say yes and i wont say no 
two other exhud officials who have appeared before the house 
government operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
deborah gore dean and r hunter cushing have refused to testify 
for nearly six years monticciolo oversaw hud programs in new 
york new jersey puerto rico and the us virgin islands on his 
last financial disclosure form filed with the federal government 
monticciolo listed a 15 percent ownership in eagle he did not 
place a monetary value on his share 
eagles 10 initial investors put up a total of 500000 to 
launch the company according to a new york newsday investigation 
published last month however monticciolo kicked in just several 
hundred dollars rather than the 75000 that would have been his 
proportionate share the paper found 
some of the investors not monticciolo signed personal 
guarantees to borrow another 500000 bringing eagles total 
capital to 1 million newsday found 
eagle is partners with cleofe rubi a prominent puerto rican 
contractor in a san juan hotel project according to the wall 
street journal rubi reportedly is the landlord for huds offices 
in puerto rico and was involved in at least three hud moderate 
rehabilitation projects in the commonwealth 
the mod rehab program has been suspended following allegations 
that the money went to consultants and developers with connections 
to highranking hud officials 
rubi and other prominent puerto ricans contributed 18000 to 
new york sen alfonse damatos campaign on the same day in 1987 a 
month before the senator sought mod rehab funding for puerto rico 
according to hud and federal election commission records damato 
requested money for 525 units in puerto rico but only 130 units in 
new york according to an internal hud memo obtained under the 
freedom of information act 
on his last financial disclosure form monticciolo reported 
hotel and meal reimbursements for two trips to puerto rico in may 
and august 1987 to attend meetings of the mortgage bankers 
association of puerto rico and the puerto rico home builders 
association 
deborah gore dean who became pierces executive assistant upon 
lance wilsons departure told the wall street journal in may that 
monticciolo got his job as hud regional administrator through 
damato and that the two of them did what they could for people 
who raised money and supported the senator 
im not worried about that she added its the system of 
spoils and favoritism 
in 1982 hud came under fire for its dealings with first 
american housing preservation association a goldstein company set 
up the year before to acquire hud projects 
shortly after first american was incorporated edward weidenfeld 
became a director and counsel to the company weidenfeld had been 
counsel to the reagan campaign committee his wife sheila betty 
fords former press secretary and a member of the reagan transition 
team at hud owned 50 percent of the company 
weidenfeld arranged a meeting between first american and hud 
officials including monticciolo and philip winn huds 
thenfederal housing commissioner soon thereafter hud agreed to 
sell seven apartment buildings to first american rather than put 
them out for public bidding as required by law two of the seven 
projects were in connecticut the others were in new york and new 
jersey hud also proposed lending the buyers all but 550000 of 
the 109 million sale price 
the negotiations were exposed in may 1982 by the washington 
post leading to investigations by congress and huds inspector 
general 
hud later agreed to seek bids for the projects but then sold 
the properties to the goldstein group anyway under the original 
terms 
in 1984 monticciolo urged his superiors to increase a 16 
million government loan given to goldsteins company for 
rehabilitation of the surreycarlton apartments in spring valley 
ny monticciolo said the group needed the additional money to buy 
three adjacent acres of land to conform with local parking 
requirements 
but the request was denied when hud headquarters in washington 
discovered that goldstein was a 30 percent partner in the company 
that owned the land 
also in 1984 monticciolo made a recommendation to washington 
that eventually enabled the goldstein group to make a 17 million 
profit on the sevenapartment deal 
goldstein wrote monticciolo asking that his company be allowed 
to prepay all the outstanding mortgages and rehabilitation loans on 
the properties even though the terms of the loans barred 
prepayment for 15 years newsday reported 
four days later monticciolo wrote to maurice barksdale then 
federal housing commissioner recommending the prepayment plan 
newsday found the mortgages were prepaid may 30 1985 by the end 
of 1986 the paper revealed the goldstein group had sold the seven 
hud properties for more than 27 million

us economic growth slowed to a lackluster 
annual rate of 17 percent in the spring while inflation driven by 
higher food and energy costs raced ahead at the fastest pace in 
more than six years the government reported thursday 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health turned in its weakest showing 
since mid1986 as growth was held back by a slump in auto sales and 
housing construction 
the bush administration insisted that the gnp report did not 
raise the specter of an imminent recession but private economists 
were not as confident 
they expressed concerns that the yearlong effort on the part of 
the federal reserve board to fight inflation with higher interest 
rates had taken its toll on the economic recovery which has 
already lasted a peactime record of 6 years 
while the federal reserve has reversed course and is now 
lowering interest rates in an effort to keep the economy moving 
forward some analysts worried that the aboutface has come too 
late 
the 17 percent gnp increase in the apriljune quarter was down 
sharply from a revised 37 percent advance in the first three 
months of the year although the januarymarch figure was inflated 
by a bounceback in the farm sector from last years drought 
the second quarter growth rate was the weakest since a 08 
percent rise in the third quarter of 1986 the last time the 
economy skirted close to a recession 
inflationary pressures grew more intense in the spring as well 
with a price index tied to the gnp rising at an annual rate of 49 
percent the biggest increase since 1982 
administration economists said they believed the surge in energy 
and food costs was abating they said this lessening of 
inflationary pressures would give the fed more room to lower 
interest rates and this would provide the spark for a rebound in 
growth in the second half of the year 
we believe that the economy will continue to do well said 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers we believe that modest growth will continue 
the bush administration last week slightly lowered its economic 
forecast for this year putting growth at 29 percent instead of 
32 percent even with this downward revision the economy will 
have to grow at a 27 percent rate in the second half of the year 
for the adminstration to meet its target for 1989 
many private economists said they were looking for growth in the 
final half of this year to be a much weaker 10 percent 
i see no signs that the economy is picking up said lawrence 
chimerine senior adviser to the wefa group an economic consulting 
firm we have moved into a very slowgrowth environment and the 
only question is whether it will deteriorate into a recession 
jerry jordan chief economist of first interstate bancorp of los 
angeles said he believes the country has already entered into a 
short recession with gnp figures in both the current third quarter 
and the fourth quarter turning negative 
we think we will have a fairly short and shallow recession 
with a rebound occurring in the first quarter of next year he 
said 
but most other analysts are predicting that the economy can 
skirt an outright downturn but will suffer through a socalled 
growth recession a period when the economy expands at such a 
sluggish pace that unemployment rises 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill another 
consulting firm predicted that unemployment which currently 
stands at 53 percent would rise to around 6 percent by early next 
year because of a prolonged period of subpar growth 
right now we appear on track for the feds hopedfor soft 
landing said david wyss an econommist with drimcgraw hill 
referring to a period when growth slows enough to dampen 
inflationary pressures but not enough to pitch the economy into a 
slump 
after driving up interest rates for a year the fed switched in 
june and since then has made three small moves to push rates lower 
including an easing move earlier this week the adverse effects of 
the earlier tightening were apparent in the gnp report 
housing construction plunged at an annual rate of 136 percent 
in the second quarter the steepest decline since the first quarter 
of 1982 when the country was mired in the last recession 
personal consumption spending rose at a sluggish rate of 11 
percent held back by a 40 percent drop in spending on bigticket 
items such as autos 
trade also weakened in the spring as a big surge in imports 
primarily oil erased much of the increase in us export sales 
with thursdays report the commerce department revised its gnp 
data for the last three years those revisions generally showed the 
economy was stronger than previously believed 
growth in 1988 was revised upward to 44 percent instead of an 
earlier figure of 39 percent this was the strongest annual growth 
rate since a 68 percent increase in 1984 
the various changes left the gnp growing at an annual rate of 
412 trillion in the second quarter

illegal technology transfers to the soviet union 
may be increasing despite growing western efforts to stem the flow 
a state department official said thursday 
we have evidence that transfers continue unabated and 
may have even increased said allan wendt in charge of state 
department strategic technology policy that troubles us 
immensely that is a very real problem 
wendt met with reporters on what he called a routine trip to 
consult some partners in the 17member coordinating committee for 
multilateral export controls cocom based in paris 
saying cocoms purpose was not to impose political sanctions but 
to reduce the military threat to the west wendt said cocom 
partners had no plans to change the preferred status given china 
despite last months crackdown on its prodemocracy movement but 
he said there would be no more concessions to beijing 
no one wishes to roll back what has already been 
accomplished he said for further liberalization this is not 
the time the policy is not abandoned but it is in suspense 
although he declined to discuss specific cocom violations wendt 
acknowledged that us authorities were concerned with sensitive 
exports leaving west germany for the soviet bloc 
a us defense department document obtained by the associated 
press earlier this year identified west germany as a major source 
of technology leakage 
wendt said officials in bonn assured him they were tightening 
license procedures penalties and enforcement and that the west 
germans were aware of possible leaks because of joint ventures with 
moscow 
we believe their response has been very encouraging said 
wendt 
although draft legislation to tighten exports is pending west 
german officials were limited to firmer application of existing 
rules until the new laws were passed wendt said 
also he said exports were vital to the west german economy 
creating political pressures 
west germany among other cocom partners has argued forcefully 
that excessive us caution stifles trade and ties down enforcing 
agents 
wendt said that washington tends to be a a bit more risk 
averse than its cocom partners but that no fundamental 
differences divided the organization 
last week cocom partners agreed to remove export controls on 
some desktop computers such as the at a widely used ibm model 
some other controls were relaxed wendt said the decisions would 
take effect aug 15

results of more than 900 statewide exams at 
six new york city area schools have been thrown out in the wake of 
a june cheating scandal state education department officials said 
thursday 
the department also will change the way it distributes the 
regents tests for next months makeup of a canceled chemistry exam 
said state education commissioner thomas sobol he said other 
measures are being considered to counter security breaches 
the invalidated tests are the result of a cheating scandal that 
erupted last month when the new york post published the answer key 
of a regents chemistry test to illustrate a busy black market in 
stolen exams 
results of a sophomore level math test given the same day as 
the scheduled chemistry exam were canceled at six schools in one 
school some students had us history test results invalidated 
there were 400 math test results thrown out one school and an 
unknown number of tests invalidated at another sobol said one 
test result was discarded at each of three other schools school 
officials announced last month that an estimated 500 test results 
were thrown out at the sixth school 
sobol said three other schools have indicated that they may 
invalidate results for some or all of their students but they 
havent made a final decision he would not identify the schools 
the schools do the invalidating based on their knowledge of a 
students past performance 
regents tests given in 17 subjects generally account for about 
25 percent of a students high school grade and are used to measure 
how well students learn a statemandated curriculum regents exams 
are not necessary for a high school diploma 
for the aug 17 chemistry test sobol said the exams will be 
delivered to each school either on the morning they are given or 
the day before 
for next years exams the education department is considering 
requiring that principals pick up the test papers at regional 
distribution centers spread throughout the state on the week exams 
are given sobol said 
officials want to see how the august procedure works before 
making a final decision on future security measures said 
department spokesman christopher carpenter 
previously the education department had delivered tests to each 
school principal five days in advance where the school official 
was to keep them under lock and key 
sobol also said hed like the legislature to make stealing exams 
a felony instead of a misdemeanor increasing penalties the 
department is also exploring the possibility of electronic 
distribution of answer keys he said

two more rounds and the woman fell to the floor the spokesman said 
she had been shot at least once in the chest and was pronounced

soviet authorities granted permission to 1556 
people to leave the country this year but withheld exit visas from 
299 others because they knew state secrets or had other problems 
an official said thursday 
rudolf kuznetsov head of the visa office said the soviet union 
had pledged at a human rights conference vienna six months ago to 
review 1850 applications for exit permits previously rejected by 
authorities 
in accordance with international documents including the 
vienna document and guided by our internal legislation 299 
persons were not accorded the permits owing to specific 
circumstances he said 
since the vienna accords were signed 1325 exit permits have 
been issued for soviets to leave the country temporarily and 231 
permanently 
most of the rejected applicants were turned down because they 
possess information considered to be state secrets he said other 
problems included persons who cannot settle relations with their 
parents or former spouses 
yuri kashlev the soviet ambassador to the vienna human rights 
conference said before jan 19 we had 1855 refuseniks we 
pledged there to review their cases within six months 
he said there were only about 300 refuseniks remaining in 
the soviet union most of them in possession of state secrets the 
others have already gone abroad he said 
kashlev said the soviet record of permitting emigration and just 
ordinary travel had greatly improved over the years before 1987 
last year 108000 people were given exit permits and another 
91000 permits were issued in the first six months of this year he 
said 
but problems have arisen with soviets plans to enter other 
countries 
we warn all soviet citizens who are going to reside abroad not 
to sell their goods not to quit their jobs or sell their 
apartments until they get entry visas to other countries 
particularly the united states kashlev said 
he said 28000 people with valid soviet exit permits were 
waiting for the us embassy to issue them visas forming long 
lines daily in front of the consular offices 
it is the only long line we are not responsible for kashlev 
quipped referring to the long lines outside many soviet stores 
in a recent interview a us official said the proposed 
liberalization of soviet emigration laws has nearly quadrupled the 
number of soviets seeking to settle in the united states 
max robinson consulgeneral at the us embassy said about 
33000 soviets went to the united states last year this year he 
said soviets are registering their intent to emigrate at an annual 
rate of 120000 and that could reach a quarter of a million by 1990 
the united states has a policy of giving all soviets who seek 
to emigrate to the united states the chance to do so robinson 
said 
the supreme soviet parliament is debating legislation that would 
loosen restrictions on soviets traveling abroad to visit or to live 
i think that once the new emigration law comes into effect and 
a pattern is established it could double next year and come 
awfully close to a quarter million robinson said

here are lists of cities that fail to meet 
federal requirements for ozone and carbon monoxide 
while areas are grouped under provisions of president bushs 
clean air proposal congress could choose a different system if it 
passes new legislation also congress could choose to accept the 
bush bill but push back the deadlines which assume final passage 
by jan 1 
the moderate and marginal areas for ozone have the same 
deadlines but would differ in the measures required for cleanup

despite large economic gains black americans 
have made over the last 50 years their progress has stagnated or 
worsened relative to whites since the early 1970s a report 
concluded thursday 
the national research council report said blacks have been hurt 
by a slowdown in the us economy during the last two decades and 
by persistent racial inequalities in education housing and other 
aspects of american society 
a legacy of discrimination and segregation continues to affect 
blackwhite relations said study director gerald jaynes a yale 
university professor of economics and africanamerican studies 
the 27 million study entitled a common destiny blacks in 
american society was financed by several foundations and 
charitable organizations for the national research council the 
principle operating agency of the national academies of sciences 
and engineering a congressionally chartered private nonprofit 
organization 
begun in 1985 the study is based on data and research analyses 
assessing the position of blacks in american society since the eve 
of world war ii the 22member study committee included experts in 
a range of academic specialties 
jaynes said the study committee found that by any calibration 
other than that of an unrepentant segregationist race relations 
and blacks status are remarkably improved since the world war ii 
era 
however the status of blacks relative to whites has stagnated 
or regressed since the early 1970s he said 
the report said blacks status was improved by a rapidly growing 
us economy in the three decades following the war which boosted 
the standard of living for all americans 
blacks also have benefitted from the civil rights movement and 
from a social activism that have bolstered equal opportunity 
efforts the report said 
however the slowdown of the us economy in the early 1970s has 
hurt the earnings of americans generally and particularly those 
with the least skills and lowest incomes 
although blacks earnings have risen relative to whites during 
the last 15 years this gain is partially offset by reduced 
employment rates for blacks the report said 
during this period the proportion of black families with 
incomes of more than 35000 annually increased from 16 percent in 
1970 to 21 percent in 1986 at the same time the segment with 
incomes below 10000 grew from 27 percent to 30 percent 
the gap between the races in terms of poverty has been about the 
same since 1939 black poverty rates are about two to three times 
white poverty rates 
mean earnings for blacks and whites improved steadily from 1939 
through 1969 and then slightly through the 1970s before dropping in 
the 1980s however blacks also improved their earnings in relation 
to whites making about 42 percent of per capita white earnings in 
1939 but 56 percent by 1984 during this period black women all 
but closed the gap rising from 56 percent of per capita white 
female earnings to 96 percent in 1984 
the report said attitudes toward work and the desire to succeed 
are about the same among the poor and the better off 
residential and educational segregation continues to hold blacks 
back the report said 
housing segregation that has concentrated blacks in major urban 
areas has not changed much since 1960 and in 1980 nearly 
twothirds of black students in public elementary and secondary 
schools attended schools where more than half the students were 
members of minorities the report found 
blacks also face a large gap in mortality and morbidity relative 
to whites infant deaths are twice as high for blacks as for 
whites and 22 percent of blacks compared with 14 percent of 
whites dont have health insurance and arent covered by medicaid

the elusive imposter who posed as an 
astronaut military officer and pro baseball player before his 
arrest on fraud charges and his announced run for mayor has skipped 
out on warrants in two states police said 
state police said wednesday they believe robert j hunt may be 
in new york city where he reportedly appeared on a radio talk show 
last week 
hunt 27 apparently fled as arrest warrants were issued in 
massachusetts and new hampshire 
three weeks ago a man who identified himself as a campaign 
worker for hunt called the associated press and outlined hunts 
latest campaign ploy after having heard that mayor george colella 
had arranged for pizzas to be delivered to some elderly residents 
the caller said hunt planned to deliver pizza to the mayor himself 
i will be the next mayor of revere hunt said last month 
after announcing he would run i am honest i think the people 
are saying that if this guy can do what he did maybe he can do 
something for this community 
people like me hunt said i know how to talk to people 
ill make a great politician 
hunt was surprisingly effective in what he called his 
impersonations while posing as an astronaut hunt sipped tea 
with the lord mayor of dublin signed autographs and lectured at an 
aviation club called the experimental aviation club 
he was a very good speaker he entertained us he held us 
spellbound for 2 hours the greater boston chapter president 
lou pascucci said after hunts arrest early this year 
the son of a plumber from everett hunt at one point scorched 
some kitchen tiles and told his wife at the time that they fell off 
the illfated challenger shuttle in june hunt said he was in the 
process of divorcing his fourth wife 
he will show up somewhere else with a scam said state 
police detective andrew palombo who arrested hunt last 
januaryhe is incapable of doing anything that is not bizarre 
and he is not going to get a 9to5 job 
hunt was convicted in may of fraudulent use of a credit card in 
renting a private jet airplane and of swindling a saugus family out 
of 4000 
he was ordered to make regular restitution payments to his 
victims as part of his probation in east boston and lynn district 
courts 
court officials and palumbo said payments were not made and the 
two courts issued arrest warrants 
he also failed to appear for a july 12 hearing in new hampshire 
at which rockingham county attorney brian graf planned to ask a 
judge to impose a threeyear suspended sentence hunt got in 1986 
for issuing bad checks 
a warrant for his arrest was issued there after he failed to 
appear 
palombo went to the elder hunts home in revere to arrest hunt 
july 12 and found that he had left 
hunts father leo hunt said his son had left his clothes and 
he thought he was staying with friends in new yorks greenwich 
village

us drug agents in peru frustrated by 
heavily armed guerrillas in the worlds foremost cocaineproducing 
region needlessly risked their lives last month to capture a 
guerrilla flag in a jungle clearing the state departments chief 
watchdog said thursday 
it was an outrageous use of a government chopper and they put 
themselves in harms way unnecessarily department inspector 
general sherman funk said after he disclosed the incident at a 
senate foreign relations subcommittee hearing 
the june 13 incident illustrated the difficulty agents face in 
trying to run eradication programs in the upper huallaga valley 
which is essentially controlled by the ruthless sendero luminoso 
or shining path guerrillas 
guerrilla activity including frequent firefights with 
government police and military has forced us officials to close 
down their eradication efforts until a fortified base can be 
completed at santa lucia that base may be ready for use as early 
as next month 
but drug enforcement administration agents apparently angry at 
being stymied by the guerrillas swooped down onto an island in the 
huallaga river to seize a sendero luminoso flag after first 
riddling the ground with gunfire funk said the incident was not 
the first of its kind he added 
the incident involved two us government helicopters if there 
were guerrillas present they did not return fire and were not seen 
by the agents funk said adding that the us ambassador in lima 
alexander f watson blew his top when he heard about it 
five of the people involved including dea agents and private 
pilots working under contract for the government have either been 
disciplined or ordered out of the country he said 
it is one of those unfortunate things said melvyn levitsky 
assistan secretary of state for international narcotics matters 
who acknowledged management and coordination problems in the 
programs 
but levitsky and other top antidrug officials defended their 
efforts although imperfect as the only alternative to a total 
surrender to drug producers 
david westrate assistant dea administrator for operations said 
he still believed the government ultimately can cut by half the 
flow of cocaine from south america to the united states nearly all 
production comes from perus upper huallaga valley and the chapare 
province of bolivia he noted 
authorities should be able to gain increasing control of air 
land and water routes out of those areas and cut the flow of coca 
leaf and paste to colombia where it is refined packaged and 
shipped he said 
we cant solve this at home alone westrate said we have 
an opportunity to make a dramatic difference and we have to pursue 
that 
he acknowledged there is inefficiency in current efforts to 
manually dig up coca plants and use jungle raids to destroy crude 
processing laboratories and noted there will be increasing danger 
of violence to those involved as pressure on producers mounts 
we cannot wait for a perfect solution he said noting that 
delay only serves to allow more money weapons and equipment to 
flow to drug producers and groups like the shining path guerrillas 
funk said a recent trip by his investigators to both countries 
showed there had been improvements in dea training and that more 
agents now are able to speak spanish aircraft maintenance and 
equipment also had been improved he said 
but other problems turned up in an inspection trip a year ago 
remained including lack of any emergency evacuation plan for 
american personnel working in the upper huallaga valley and feeble 
eradication efforts 
coca production in these countries has increased every year 
and less than one percent of the illicit drugs have been seized 
funk testified he said it remains uncertain whether the programs 
which have cost more than 100 million since 1972 will have any 
meaningful impact on cocaine exports

us soybean supplies are expected to recover 
this season from the effects of the 1988 drought the agriculture 
department said thursday 
the departments economic research service said the assessment 
was based on the july 12 estimate of 613 million acres planted to 
soybeans this year and a projected harvest of 195 billion bushels 
up 27 percent from 1988 output 
agency analysts said that the soybean crush in 198990 could 
climb to 1115 billion bushels from 107 expected for 198889 
soybeans are crushed by processors into highprotein meal for 
livestock feed and oil for cooking and other food use 
exports too should rise next year but at a forecast 600 
million bushels will lag the larger volumes of the early 1980s 
the report said 
by the end of the next marketing year on aug 31 1990 soybean 
inventories are expected to be about 265 million bushels up from 
125 million bushels at the beginning of the season this sept 1 
as a result of the larger crop this year soybean market prices 
are expected to decline to an average of 475 to 625 per bushel 
in 198990 from an estimated 735 this season

new martial law regulations announced last week 
brig gen khin nyunt the governments intelligence chief told 
reporters the three had confessed to planting the bomb 
burmese authorities were also seeking moe thiha an organizer 
for the national league for democracy and the suspected mastermind 
of the bombing 
the national league is the largest and most popular opposition 
group to emerge from a national uprising for democracy 
millions of people protested nationwide last year to demand an 
end to a quarter century of military control of the government 
however military commander gen saw maung seized power in 
september and his troops crushed dissent by killing hundreds of 
people 
the two leaders of the national league aung san suu kyi and tin 
oo have been under house arrest since july 20 they were arrested 
a day after new prodemocracy protests in rangoon

and revive anarchy in the country 
before she was detained ms suu kyi who has always encouraged 
peaceful protest said she had seen no evidence the three accused 
group members were responsible for the bombing 
she suggested the confessions may have been made under duress 
no details of the trial were made public 
sources in rangoon said that since ms suu kyi and tin oo were 
arrested the military has arrested hundreds of their supporters 
there is absolutely no doubt that there is a large scale wave 
of arrests going on right now a diplomat in rangoon said 
speaking on condition of anonymity we are getting this from a 
variety of different sources and they are all pretty reliable 
they are going to peoples houses at night they are pulling 
them off the streets even off of buses or out of offices and 
hotels he said 
a member of the national league contacted earlier in the day by 
telephone from bangkok said hundreds of prodemocracy activists 
had been arrested recently 
the figure may be around a few hundred for the whole 
country the source said in rangoon some say between 160 and 
200 have been arrested and it is not only confined to the 
national league he said on condition of anonymity 
another bomb killed three people when it exploded july 10 in 
rangoons city hall a key administrative building that is heavily 
defended by troops official reports said 
authorities have also blamed that bombing on the national 
league and they say the attackers are at large

one of the worlds most lavish annual 
cultural festivals began thursday without conductor herbert von 
karajan the titan of music who dominated it for more than three 
decades 
karajan a native of salzburg died july 16 at age 81 he had 
conducted at the salzburg festival since 1948 and was its sole 
artistic director in 195660 
a member of the directorate since 1964 karajan resigned from 
that body last year but continued to wield influence on the 
festival 
in opening the festival president kurt waldheim invoked the 
memory of the maestro 
the man herbert von karajan is missing but his musical work 
will survive waldheim said he spoke at the salzburg 
festspielhaus partially draped in a black flag in mourning 
as part of a memorial to karajan there was a nationally 
televised starstudded performance of mozarts requiem at 
salzburg cathedral sunday 
karajan was to have conducted the vienna philharmonic this year 
in six performances of the verdi opera un ballo in maschera 
masked ball for the opening night performance with tenor 
placido domingo in the starring role he also had planned to 
conduct bruckners eighth symphony aug 18 
after his death sir georg solti musical director of the 
chicago symphony orchestra was picked to conduct the verdi piece 
the august concert will be conducted by carlo maria giulini and has 
been expanded to include brahms third and fourth symphonies 
the cultural fete traditionally offers one of the richest 
programs of music and drama to those who can find tickets but many 
seeking entry to the banner events are disappointed 
approximately 190000 seats were available this year but tens 
of thousands of ticket requests had to be turned away for opera and 
orchestral music performances and recital concerts with stars jose 
carreras jessye norman and agnes baltsa organizers said 
this year the festival includes six operas three plays 18 
orchestral concerts five mozart matinees nine lieder recitals 12 
chamber concerts and five ballet performances with the martha

leftwing author margaret randall remained a 
us citizen even though she became a citizen of mexico 22 years 
ago to find work there and spent 15 years in cuba and nicaragua an 
immigration appeals board ruled thursday in blocking an effort to 
deport her 
by 32 the us board of immigration appeals said that randall 
52 became a mexican citizen in 1967 under economic duress and that 
the immigration and naturalization service should not have 
considered her politics 
to tell you the truth im still a little numb randall said 
from her home in albuquerque nm where her parents live 
however objectionable the respondents randalls opinions 
and past acts may be these are not matters that can color the 
factual assessment of the voluntariness of her expatriating act 
the panel wrote 
we find that the respondent has established by a preponderance 
of the evidence that economic reasons led her to acquire mexican 
citizenship and that these economic reasons rose to the level of 
duress sufficient to negate her free choice the panel wrote 
ins claimed that randall gave up her us citizenship as a 
political protest and wanted mexican citizenship in order to get a 
passport to cuba it also claimed that as the wife of a mexican 
citizen she could have found work 
randall claimed her husband ceased providing for the three 
children one of whom was ill she was led to believe work laws in 
mexico forced her to be a citizen before she would find a job and 
many americans went to cuba with us passports despite a travel 
ban 
justice department attorneys are reviewing the decision said 
spokesman dan eramian the appeals board operates independently of 
the ins but under the auspices of the justice department of which 
the ins is a part 
attorney general dick thornburgh will have the final word on the 
case ins cannot appeal it to another court 
ins spokesman vern jervis said the office had not seen the 
ruling and could not comment directly but he did say that in the 
case that prompted the appeal randall was applying for permanent 
residency as an alien and the political standards were those used 
for an alien 
all these other questions become nonquestions at this 
point he said you cant keep a citizen out of the country 
and you cant remove a citizen from the country 
said randall id like to get on with my life its not as if 
i stopped my life ive made a tremendous effort during the last 
4 years to keep teaching keep writing keep seeing my children 
keep doing photography 
but of course living with a case like this implies an enormous 
amount of daily stress because youre constantly involved with 
press work hearings and the uncertainty of wondering is you can 
stay in the country 
washingtonbased immigration attorney michael maggio said 
randall wants to apply for a passport in order to be able to visit 
her three grandchildren who live in france and mexico 
hopefully this case signals a depolitization of the executive 
branch in a new administration where there will be less 
ideologically motivated legal actions by the justice department and 
ins so that cases can be decided how theyre supposed to be by 
the facts of the law he said 
randall was also represented by lawyers from the new yorkbased 
center for constitutional rights a private civil liberties group 
i think it the ruling affirms that us citizenship is a 
constitutional right and that one cannot lose ones citizenship 
because the government doesnt like what you say in your criticisms 
of policies said david cole a center attorney who helped 
represent randall 
in his dissent board member fred w vacca accused randall of 
being a propagandist and apologist for the cuban and sandinista 
governments he also said it was repugnant that randall 
publicly accepted a finger ring made from the wreckage of a downed 
us military aircraft when she traveled to north vietnam in 1974 
randall had returned to the united states in 1984 and her 
deportation hearings began in 1986 during that time she has held a 
number of teaching positions at universities 
in june the supreme court refused her appeal because it was 
premature and untimely 
randall whose case has been followed by a number of authors 
including toni morrison kurt vonnegut and william styron has 
written extensively about social change and revolution in third 
world countries

a coalition of aids activists saying the 
disease is becoming a leading cause of premature death in the 
united states thursday urged government leaders to reject the 
complacency that is hampering the fight against the epidemic 
the groups called for federal antidiscrimination protection for 
people with aids more aggressive healthcare planning and more 
money for research and early intervention efforts with 
lifeprolonging therapies 
we decry the complacency that has been developing in this 
nation in the face of an epidemic that is clearly an ongoing crisis 
and clearly being ignored said jean mcguire executive director 
of the aids action council and chairwoman of the national 
organizations responding to aids 
she called on the federal government to exert the leadership 
that has been missing so far in the epidemic which began in the 
early part of the decade 
the greatest threat we face may not be from the virus itself 
but the complacency we see around us she said 
the groups called the news conference to mark the spread of the 
epidemic to its 100000th case 
no one knows when the reported cases reached this level but the 
centers for disease control said it happened sometime in recent 
weeks 
as of june 30 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 99936 
americans of whom more than half or 58014 have died since june 
1 1981 according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered 
the growing number of cases is expected to make aids one of the 
leading causes of premature death in the united states by 1992 
according to the human rights campaign fund 
using a measure called years of potential life lost ypll 
the group projects 65000 aids deaths in 1992 will result in 17 
million ypll third behind accidents and cancer the measure is 
based on the difference between a persons age at death and a life 
expectancy of 65 years 
while it took eight years for 100000 aids cases to develop 
that number is expected to double over the next 15 months and could 
quadruple by the end of 1991 mcguire said 
the federal government is spending about 13 billion this year 
on aids research prevention and education president bush proposed 
to spend 16 billion in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 but 
the groups said more is needed 
among the indications of government retrenchment the groups 
cited was a house appropriations committee decision earlier this 
week to direct public health officials to cancel a proposed survey 
of americans sexual behaviors the public health service said the 
purpose of the survey was to better understand the spread of the 
disease 
the groups also cited the committees decision to stop 
earmarking money specifically for aids research in the national 
institutes of health budget 
this is trying to restore aids to business as usual said 
jeff levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian task 
force

a national campaign to rally support for the 
military crackdown on prodemocracy protests has accused party 
veteran zhao ziyang of being the chief culprit lurking behind most 
of chinas woes 
when the communist party central committee ousted zhao as 
general secretary on june 24 it accused him of splitting the party 
and supporting studentled demonstrations crushed by soldiers in 
early june 
since then he has been blamed for everything from the nations 
economic woes to rampant corruption pornography bad literature 
and lower productivity 
zhao first came under direct criticism by other party leaders 
last year for problems arising from chinas economic reforms 
having spearheaded marketoriented reforms initiated by senior 
leader deng xiaoping he was held responsible when decentralization 
of the economy contributed to runaway inflation and panicbuying 
recent media commentaries repeat those criticisms and add a slew 
of new accusations 
government spokesman yuan mu told reporters that because zhao 
allegedly neglected to promote communist ideological education he 
also should be blamed for endemic corruption 
zhao ziyang once openly stated that corruption is inevitable 
in the primary stages of a commercial economy yuan said 
the national trade federation chief ni zhifu said workers 
enthusiasm and implicitly their productivity is low because 
some persons advocated blunting their leading role the phrase 
some persons increasingly common in editorials and speeches 
is understood to refer to zhao 
zhao ziyang for a long time has not spoken about relying on 
the leadership of the working class complained legislator wang 
houde who claimed zhao is elitist and stressed people with ability 
over ordinary workers 
a group of writers and artists blame him for pornography 
comrade zhao ziyang certainly didnt firmly grasp party 
ideology so that all sorts of garbage appeared in our 
society gu zuogang of the china dance association said at a 
forum organized by the party propaganda department 
zhang jiong a researcher at the chinese academy of social 
sciences told the meeting that under zhao there was no 
distinction between right and wrong and sex and violence filled 
the literary market 
others contend zhao was too tolerant of western liberal 
thinking the recent rebellion was a result of zhao ziyang 
not supporting the fight against bourgeois liberalization from the 
beginning the peoples daily party newspaper said wednesday 
the official xinhua news agency said in a commentary now if 
we do not earnestly oppose bourgeois liberalism our party and 
country will certainly be in danger of perishing 
even moderate party leaders like hu qili and yen mingfu who 
were linked with zhao in allegedly supporting the protests 
placed all the blame on zhao when confronted with their errors 
hong kongs ming pao newspaper reported 
its not the first time chinese leaders have sought a scapegoat 
for sticky political and economic problems after the ultraleftist 
gang of four were ousted in 1976 ending the tumultuous decadelong 
cultural revolution it became common practice to blame them for 
all chinas woes including its economic backwardness 
the gang of four including jiang qing widow of revolutionary 
leader mao tsetung eventually were tried publicly for treason 
they remain in jail 
so far zhao has escaped that fate he has been stripped of all 
party posts but retains party membership and has been accused only 
of mistakes the party can deal with internally however officials 
say their investigation continues 
another casualty is luo zhengqi who has been fired as president 
of shenzhen university and the areas party chief 
authorities in shenzhen one of chinas most reformminded 
cities said thursday they fired luo for making serious unspecified 
mistakes during the protests suggesting he was judged too 
sympathetic to the students 
earlier this week authorities in central anhui province fired 
the deputy education commissioner for allegedly encouraging 
protests 
they ended when soldiers attacked unarmed demonstrators june 34 
in beijing and killed hundreds and perhaps thousands china says 
only 100 civilians and nearly 100 soldiers and police were slain 
zhao has not appeared in public since may 18 when he tearfully 
appealed to students in tiananmen square to stop protesting 
unofficial reports say variously that he is under house arrest or 
in the hospital 
although zhao was not popular he represented a new style of 
chinese leader suave articulate and at ease with leaders of both 
the socialist and western worlds 
now his immaculately tailored western suits and golfplaying 
have become political liabilities

jens soering is in a london jail and britain has a 
dilemma send him to virginia where he could face execution if 
convicted of murder or violate its extradition treaty by honoring 
a european court order not to do so 
soering whose father is the west german consul in detroit is 
accused of helping his american girlfriend elizabeth haysom kill 
her wealthy parents in march 1985 in lynchburg va a bedford 
county grand jury indicted them on murder charges after they fled 
to london 
miss haysom now 24 returned home in may 1987 without fighting 
extradition admitted being an accessory and was sentenced to 90 
years in prison 
authorities say soering 22 has admitted participating in the 
killings but has given differing accounts of the circumstances he 
has been in a south london jail for three years while fighting 
extradition to the united states 
on july 7 the european court of human rights decided soering 
must not be extradited because if convicted he might spend years 
on death row awaiting execution that would violate his human 
rights it said 
the court is a branch of the 23nation council of europe to 
which britain belongs and its decisions are not binding but rarely 
are ignored if britain abides by the ruling it will violate its 
1972 extradition treaty with the united states 
our practice is to abide by the rulings of the european 
court said an official of the home office which has indicated 
an announcement was possible as early as friday his statement 
appeared to be a hint against extradition 
lawyers say soering probably will be returned to west germany 
which also has sought his extradition and is willing to try him 
german law allows trials for crimes committed in other countries 
louis blomcooper a leading british lawyer said the case 
illustrates the difference between western europe where capital 
punishment is effectively outlawed and the united states where 
virginia and 35 other states have capital punishment 
the court ruling rather than citing the death penalty deplored 
the death row phenomenon by which convicts spent an average of 
six to eight years awaiting execution while their cases go through 
lengthy appeals process 
its all very well for them us authorities to beat their 
breasts but we live in a civilized world that does not impose 
death row blomcooper said 
bedford county prosecutor james w updike jr said the european 
court is essentially stating that the constitution of the united 
states and the system of justice we have in this country violates 
human rights i cant accept that 
i do not know of any country that provides any better 
protection for human rights he said in a british broadcasting 
corp television program broadcast sunday 
britain ordered soering extradited in august 1988 but then the 
european court accepted his case it ruled that what might await 
him in the united states violated his rights under the european 
human rights convention which forbids inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment 
lawyers say the ruling means european countries will have to 
consider the treatment suspects could face when sent to another 
country 
britain routinely asks the us federal government in capital 
cases for assurances that the suspect will not be executed if 
convicted 
the federal authorities cant give a castiron guarantee on 
behalf of the state authorities said pam teare a home office 
spokeswoman what is agreed is that the state authorities will be 
informed of the very strict recommendation of the british 
government that the death penalty should not be imposed 
in 1984 britain ignored a pending plea before the european 
court and extradited an american ernest kirkwood who was charged 
with killing two men in san francisco another american scott 
errico charged in florida with three contract killings was sent 
home for trial in 1987 
the home office said both were convicted of lesser charges and 
escaped the death penalty

a fishing vessel that rammed a canadian patrol 
boat that had tried to stop it for allegedly poaching in canadian 
water was boarded by the coast guard when it reached port thursday 
the bountiful from new beford was allegedly seven nautical 
miles into canadian water about 165 miles east of nantucket when 
it was spotted wednesday by the patrol boat 
by escaping to american water it probably dodged severe 
canadian penalties but may still face action under us law 
the skipper of the bountiful david saunders denied he was 
fishing in canadian territory and said the patrol boat rammed him 
after threatening to fire 
they deliberately ran me down he said 
they told me to get everybody off the deck because they were 
going to open fire said saunders i said were an unarmed 
vessel theres 10 unarmed guys here you cant shoot me 
asked why he refused to stop for the canadians saunders said 
would you stop if someone was stopping you with a 50caliber 
im not stopping 
it was the sixth incident in a yearlong boundary dispute 
between american fishermen and canadian patrols 
its really inconceivable that two countries as close as ours 
politically geographically cant resolve matters as relatively 
uncomplicated as this said rep gerry studds dmass a senior 
member of the house merchant marine and fisheries committee 
the chase lasted 140 miles and about 18 hours 
the canadian patrol boat cygnus chased the bountiful into the 
200mile us exclusive economic zone where it was rammed by the 
fishing boat said coast guard chief petty officer jack mason no 
injuries or serious damage were reported 
the canadian government denied the cygnus crew permission to 
fire warning shots across the bountifuls bow after it was rammed 
the bountiful was boarded by the coast guard when it docked 
thursday and national marine fisheries officials took stock of the 
catch 
ken crossman special nmfs agent for the northeast said his 
investigators would share information with canadian officials who 
could prepare an arrest warrant only executable in canada 
if the canadians provide sufficient documentation to prove the 
bountiful was illegally fishing then separately through us 
prosecution channels the boat is subject to prosecution under 
us law crossman said 
under federal law the boats captain could face a maximum 
penalty of a 10000 fine and a year in jail for transporting an 
illegal catch 
that may shed a little light for you on why its so important 
to these fishermen to not be caught by the canadians where they 
face several hundred thousand dollars in fines under canadian 
law as well as physical arrest and detention of the boat 
crossman said 
incidents along the socalled hague fisheries line the line 
set by the international court of justice in the hague 
netherlands in 1984 to separate us and canadian marine zones 
are on the rise because fishing stocks on the us side are being 
depleted and the canadians are aggressively patrolling their area 
a new bedford boat was recently pursued by the canadians for 14 
hours last year canadian patrols fired on another new bedford 
scalloper the donna lynn after its captain refused to let 
officials board claiming the boat was in us water 
canadian officials maintain the american fisherman are 
intentionally crossing the boundary but studds has said that the 
crossings are simply mistakes 
according to a studds aide jeff pike five of the six 
navigational charts issued to american fisherman by the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration contain uscanadian border 
errors of up to four miles

the war against foliageeating gypsy moths 
made a gain in oregon but then fluttered into retreat in north 
carolina and utah the agriculture department said thursday 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said oregon has been removed from 
the gypsy moth quarantine list because the pest has been eradicated 
from lane county which had been the insects toehold in the state 
federal quarantine regulations restrict the interstate movement 
of outdoor household articles lawn furniture and certain camping 
equipment for example that might harbor moths and spread them to 
other states 
based on treatments and subsequent surveys we have determined 
that the gypsy moth no longer occurs in lane county and that 
there is no further need to restrict the movement of outdoor 
household articles from this area 
lane county was the only quarantined area in oregon so the 
state has been removed from usdas official list of gypsy moth 
states 
meanwhile glossers agency is designating all or portions of 
currituck and dare counties in north carolina as gypsy moth 
lowrisk areas thus adding north carolina to the list 
glosser said inspectors have found that the counties are 
infested by the moths but that the number of egg masses per acre is 
not high enough for those counties to be rated as highrisk 
areas 
by agency reckoning an area is highrisk when it has more than 
50 masses of moth eggs per acre 
glosser said a portion of salt lake county utah is a highrisk 
area and that this adds the state to the moth list

the communist party daily on 
thursday rejected calls by members of polands solidarity movement 
to reassess czechoslovakias 1968 reforms crushed by a warsaw pact 
invasion 
in a related development a leading activist reported police 
searches of six dissident homes 
the search appeared to be focused against obroda a new group of 
reform communists and police seemed to be looking for a petition 
demanding democratic reforms that has gathered more than 11500 
signatures said activist petr uhl 
one of the residences searched was that of jan urban who 
accompanied a visiting solidarity delegation last week uhl said in 
a telephone call to the vienna bureau of the associated press 
after their visit five solidarity members urged the communists 
to review the prague spring political and economic reforms and 
embrace similar changes now 
while in czechoslovakia the solidarity activists met with 
leading dissidents and with alexander dubcek 
after nearly two decades of silence dubcek the former 
communist party leader who engineered the reforms and who was 
ousted after the invasion has been increasingly critical of the 
present leaderships rigidity 
czechoslovakias current leaders were installed by the kremlin 
in the wake of the invasion their endorsement of soviet economic 
reforms has been lukewarm and they have rejected any political 
liberalization of the kind taking place in some other soviet bloc 
countries 
encouraged by the soviet reforms hungary and poland are moving 
from strict communist rule to greater political plurality and are 
increasing market forces in their economies the editorial was 
scornful of such change 
the visiting solidarity delegation was looking for ways to 
force our country to adopt reforms of polish style to force our 
country into an economic anarchy the rude pravo newspaper said 
solidarity and its czechoslovak advocates have set an aim 
to reevaluate the period of the end of the 1960s the paper 
said however we have no reason to reevaluate these events 
the solidarity activists led by adam michnik now a deputy in 
the polish parliament said they wanted to join czechoslovaks in 
unofficial events to mark the 21st anniversary of the invasion aug 
21 
rude pravo said it was too soon for solidarity to give us 
advice as they themselves have not acheived anything positive 
yet 
the majority of the population of czechoslovakia does not long 
for disorders which solidarity has caused in poland does not long 
for economic chaos empty stores and inflation said rude pravo 
alluding to polands serious economic difficulties

and official misconduct 
twelve other people including the city council president the 
chairman of the zoning board and the former housing authority 
director also were arrested after an investigation that one 
official said showed this seaside resort was up for sale 
our investigation uncovered the deplorable circumstances in 
which corruption has reached the highest levels of atlantic city 
municipal government state police superintendent col clinton l

inclusion that kean has tried to make a hallmark of his career as 
a republican politician

a federal judge thursday reversed his own 
decision and vacated the conviction of a man jailed 13 years ago 
for killing a policeman saying prosecutors covered up evidence 
v james landano sentenced to life in prison has maintained he 
was framed by motorcycle gang members protecting the real killer 
his childhood friend 
newly uncovered evidence from impounded investigative files 
showed prosecutors withheld witness statements incriminating the 
other man and indicating landano 49 was not the killer said 
us district judge h lee sarokin 
two years ago sarokin denied landanos first appeal to him on 
technical grounds 
we live in a nation in which liberty is cherished second only 
to life itself sarokin wrote in thursdays opinion 
he said the prosecution showed a pattern of failures in 
turning over exculpatory evidence 
oh god were landanos words when he heard the decision 
said defense attorney neil m mullin 
mullin told landano the news after landano made a collect call 
from east jersey state prison in avenel to the federal courthouse 
press room 
its taken me 13 years to have somebody see what was done to 
me he said in an interview all i could think of was the names 
and faces of the people who stood by me 
its been hell but its over to sum it up in one word im 
going to live ive existed for 13 years now im going to live 
landano and three others including his longtime friend victor 
forni were charged in the 1976 killing of a newark police officer 
at the robbery of a checkcashing establishment in kearny landano 
was convicted as the gunman forni was later convicted of planning 
the crime for the breed motorcycle gang and served nine months of a 
twoyear sentence 
in unsuccessful appeals through the state system and up to the 
us supreme court landano denied he was at the scene and 
contended he was framed by the breed to protect forni 
at the courthouse landanos wife camille trembling and 
flushed hugged landanos joyful lawyers and supporters 
mullin said landano probably would have been executed had there 
been a new jersey death penalty at the time of his conviction the 
state presently has the death penalty a bail hearing has been set 
for monday morning in state court in jersey city 
the state will decide within the next several days whether to 
appeal said state criminal justice director robert winter 
hudson county prosecutor paul depascale declined to comment on 
the ruling but said he expected the attorney generals office to 
appeal thomas mulcahy the hudson county assistant prosecutor who 
tried the case and is now in private practice denied witholding 
evidence 
the happy scene at federal court was in strong contrast to sept 
30 1987 that day sarokin said because a state court already had 
ruled on an issue of fact that was in question precedent did not 
allow the federal justice to act but he invited a higher court to 
reverse him he called his ruling a bitter exercise in judicial 
restraint since it may result in a gross injustice 
landano did not give up princeton minister james mccloskey who 
investigates cases for indigent inmates claiming their innocence 
pitched in and found more evidence pointing to landanos innocence 
sarokin ordered investigative files seized and from them 
landanos lawyers found the papers on which the judge based 
thursdays decision 
one was a kearny police interview report with a witness at a 
warehouse near the crime scene who picked out a photograph of 
forni as the getaway car driver another witness had said the 
driver was the gunman the report had never been given to landano 
and the identified picture never found 
sarokin also cited a handwritten document from kearny police 
files saying that the only eyewitness of the shooting had said of 
landano that his hair was not right the suspect had curly hair 
notes on another witness said the same thing

apriljune quarter pushed higher by a steep jump in oil prices 
the labor department said thursday 
energy prices jumped 18 percent in the second quarter following 
an 184 percent rise in the first three months of the year 
if not for the big surge in energy costs import prices would

nonfuel import prices a stronger dollar makes imported goods 
cheaper for americans to buy import prices had risen 18 percent 
in the first quarter 
the price of us exports edged down 01 percent in the second 
quarter following a big 15 percent rise in the first quarter

sri lanka said thursday it will not 
fight india even if india refuses to remove peacekeeping forces by 
president ranasinghe premadasas saturday deadline 
the government imposed a nationwide curfew to prevent violence 
by sinhalese radicals leading an antiindia campaign staterun 
radio said the curfew would begin at midnight and remain in force 
until saturday morning 
officials in new delhi and colombo said foreign minister ranjan 
wijeratne and unidentified indian officials were negotiating the 
indian withdrawal in colombo 
wijeratne told reporters that india had not agreed to two major 
conditions to accept premadasa as the commanderinchief of sri 
lankan forces and honor a ceasefire between indian troops and 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest and most militant 
rebel group fighting for a tamil nation in northeastern sri lanka 
united news of india quoted unidentified foreign ministry 
sources in new delhi as saying india was unlikely to accept the 
conditions 
but officials in colombo said india agreed to begin withdrawing 
the troops if wijeratne agreed to visit new delhi to discuss 
outstanding issues the officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
fears of an armed confrontation between the nations mounted 
after premadasa vowed to take necessary steps if the estimated 
45000 indian soldiers deployed two years ago in northeastern sri 
lanka did not leave by saturday 
asked what sri lanka would do if india rejected the conditions 
wijeratne said we are not going to fight india we know our 
limitations 
the president will take a course of action which he will spell 
out after the 29th but we still feel we can resolve this problem 
he did not rule out the possibility of raising the issue with 
the united nations and the south asian association for regional 
cooperation india and sri lanka are members of the group along 
with pakistan nepal the maldives bangladesh and bhutan 
under a july 1987 peace accord the minority tamils were 
promised limited autonomy if militants surrendered their arms the 
indian troops were deployed in accordance with the agreement to 
supervise the transition and they operate under an indian army 
commander 
while most militias abided by the accord the dominant tamil 
tigers backed out and began attacking indian soldiers about 1000 
troops have been killed 
premadasa demanded on june 1 that india withdraw its troops 
after the tamil tigers opened peace talks with his government 
india refused saying a premature withdrawal could lead to even 
more bloodshed 
subsequent requests by premadasa and refusals by indias prime 
minister rajiv gandhi led to a diplomatic impasse and fears about 
the safety of the indians civilians as well as soldiers on the 
island 
a tamil newspaper published in jaffna 185 miles north of 
colombo said thursday that at least 15 tamil civilians were killed 
in cross fire wednesday during a clash between the rebels and 
indian soldiers at the northern village of point pedro a rebel 
stronghold 
a foreign ministry official in new delhi said the soldiers shot 
and killed nine rebels the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity made no mention of civilian casualties 
sinhalese extremists say indias presence compromises sri 
lankas sovereignty and they have launched a violent 
antigovernment and antiindian campaign 
on wednesday attackers hurled two bombs at two indian banks 
near the capital while others set fire to an indianowned factory 
police blamed the attacks on sinhalese militants belonging to the 
leftwing peoples liberation front 
about 4000 people have died in the fronts twoyear campaign 
at least 11000 people were killed in the sixyear tamil separatist 
movement 
the predominantly hindu tamils who make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas population say the sinhalese discriminate against them in 
jobs and education the buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 percent 
of the 16 million people control the government and the military

a house committee on thursday approved a flag 
protection bill that was pushed by democrats but dismissed by 
republicans as useless for overcoming the supreme court ruling 
permitting flag burning 
one democratic leader said he and others in his party would go 
to the wall to block a constitutional amendment against flag 
desecration which the republicans and president bush say is 
necessary 
the house judiciary committee in a quarrelsome session voted 
286 for a statute that says whoever knowingly mutilates 
defaces burns or tramples upon any flag of the united states shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year 
or both 
all but one of the 13 republicans voting supported the bill as 
a symbolic gesture for the flag one said but the republican 
leadership blocked the democrats plan to bring the bill before the 
full house next week 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois told reporters 
that white house chief of staff john sununu urged the gop 
leadership this week to speak out more on the flag because it was a 
wedge issue one that breaks the democrats apart 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said at a news conference 
after the vote that the bill would come up in september and he 
couldnt imagine why any lawmaker would favor amending the 
constitution if a regular statute would protect the flag 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo added the 
people who pose as the most vigilant supporters of flag protection 
seem more interested in adding political graffiti to the 
constitution than in protecting the physical integrity of the 
american flag 
the democrats carried with them the us flag that flew over the 
capitol the day pearl harbor was attacked in rome after that city 
was liberated and over the uss missouri when gen douglas 
macarthur accepted japans surrender 
in the war of symbols bush had used the iwo jima memorial to 
the marines when he endorsed the constitutional amendment 
in the committee gop members were repeatedly beaten back when 
they attempted to scuttle the legislation including a second 
attempt in two days to substitute a constitutional amendment 
the purpose of this statute is to provide appropriate 
protection for the american flag without getting into the first 
retreat in american history from the bill of rights said rep 
don edwards dcalif chairman of the committees constitutional 
rights subcommittee 
that is something we will go to the wall for in the morning 
in the afternoon and in the evening he said 
but republicans said the only way to overcome the supreme court 
ruling was with a constitutional amendment 
the bill is essentially useless said rep carlos moorhead 
rcalif who said republicans would vote for it in committee only 
as in symbolic support of the flag 
at the white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the statute 
proposed in congress was unconstitutional and unworkable 
the amendment is the only way to go she said predicting the 
amendment eventually will go to the floor and pass 
although determined to try a statute first before a 
constitutional amendment judiciary committee chairman jack brooks 
dtexas said he would back an amendment if the statute didnt work 
if the supreme court should rule down this statute which i do 
not believe they will i would introduce a constitutional 
amendment brooks told his committee 
the measure passed in the committee after opponents from both 
the left and the right attacked it 
this statute is a mess and its obvious its a mess from 
everything weve seen and heard this morning said rep chuck 
douglas rnh a conservative who was blocked by brooks when he 
tried to offer a constitutional amendment 
douglas the only republican to vote against the bill protested 
what he suggested were democratic strongarm tactics with props for 
the television cameras including a gag over his mouth and a pair 
of flags one dirty and one clean 
the latter was to demonstrate his doubts about a section of the 
bill allowing for disposal of worn or soiled flags traditionally 
done by burning 
rep john conyers dmich one of five democrats who voted 
against the statute and who also oppose a constitutional amendment 
offered an amendment to ban cross burnings 
cross burnings for centuries have been more of a problem in 
the united states than flag burnings said conyers who was also 
ruled out of order by brooks 
the senate is to take up both a proposed statute and 
constitutional amendment on flag desecration in october

crack abuse is spreading rapidly throughout 
britain and the government must urgently start a public awareness 
campaign to dampen demand for the highly addictive cocainebased 
drug legislators warned thursday 
parliaments home affairs committee said it was so alarmed by 
the effects of crack during a us tour last month that it rushed 
out a preliminary report calling for urgent precautions in britain 
crack the most potent and toxic form of cocaine available is 
five to 10 times as addictive as cocaine taken in other forms and 
can be almost instantly addictive the committee said 
it can take over a persons life in under a week it said 
there is as yet no such person as a fully recovered crack 
addict 
on the initiative of prime minister margaret thatcher britain 
is hosting an international conference next year on ways of 
reducing demand for drugs especially crack 
the committee made up of legislators from all main parties 
said usstyle cocaine help lines and an intelligencegathering 
network should be set up to assess the extent of crack abuse 
but it said there is enough available evidence to indicate 
crack misuse is an escalating problem 
customs agents made 36 seizures of crack in the first six months 
of this year compared with five seizures in the first half of 1987 
and 12 seizures in the first half of last year 
britain must learn from successful american antidrug 
strategies and keep in mind that us authorities initially 
underestimated the crack threat and did not place enough emphasis 
on antidrug education campaigns the committee said 
it recommended the government urgently consider establishing a 
sustained public awareness campaign in addition to current 
programs to reduce demand for crack targeted on those likely to be 
most vulnerable to crack addiction

at the request of the costa rican government 
the cia helped set up a communications station in the central 
american country and developed a program dealing with nicaraguan 
nationals a court filing by irancontra prosecutors said thursday 
the document filed in the criminal case against a former cia 
station chief provides a glimpse of the spy agencys efforts to 
help prepare costa rica for the possibility of an invasion by the 
leftist government of nicaragua starting in late 1984 
the costa rican government approached the united states for 
help says the court document filed by prosecutors from the office 
of independent counsel lawrence walsh 
initiated as a result of the request was a program to assist and 
improve the effectiveness of costa ricas defense forces the court 
document said 
another of these projects begun in 1985 was a sophisticated 
communications station to be used by the costa rican government to 
bolster the security of costa rica it added 
a third program dealing with nicaraguan nationals in costa 
rica was designed to enhance costa ricas preparation for possible 
aggressive action by nicaragua 
costa rica doesnt have a standing army but rather a civil and 
rural guard of 9500 including 3000 reservists 
prosecutors had proposed that the summary of information about 
the three highly sensitive cia programs be presented in the trial 
of joseph fernandez the agencys former station chief in costa 
rica 
but fernandez says that he must be allowed to introduce greater 
detail about the three programs to properly defend himself against 
criminal charges and us district court judge claude hilton in 
alexandria va agreed 
on monday the justice department citing national security 
concerns of the cia stepped in and obtained a stay of fernandezs 
trial from a us court of appeals judge in richmond va 
fernandez is charged with lying to the tower commission and the 
cia inspector generals office about his help to oliver norths 
resupply network to the nicaraguan contras 
in the court filing with the appeals court in richmond 
irancontra prosecutors strongly objected to the justice 
departments stepping into the case to delay the trial 
the language of the ethics in government act unambiguously 
provides the independent counsel and not the department of 
justice has the sole discretion to appeal from the district 
courts rulings said the 55page brief filed by walsh 
the justice department is seeking to formally intervene in the 
case and to have the appeals court reconsider hiltons rulings 
which conclude that fernandez needs to present substantial amounts 
of classified information in his defense

prime minister yitzhak shamir said thursday he 
resisted pressures from the united states to include a 
landforpeace clause in his peace plan and said he would never 
relinquish territory to the palestinians 
shamirs remarks in an impassioned fistthumping speech to 
rabbis in jerusalem came as plo chief yasser arafat also appeared 
to harden his position by publishing four tough preconditions to 
accepting the israeli peace proposal 
the israeli plan calls for 17 million palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip to elect representatives to 
negotiate an interim settlement of selfrule 
arafat in demands outlined by egypts stateowned newspaper 
alahram called on israel to agree to palestinian statehood in the 
occupied territories and to withdraw troops in 27 months 
in violence in the occupied lands soldiers fatally shot a 
20yearold palestinian in the chest during a stonethrowing 
protest in the west banks tulkarem refugee camp arab reports 
said the palestinian was identified as mohammed omar safouri 
an 11yearold boy was seriously wounded in the same incident 
the reports said the army said it was checking the reports 
two palestinian teenagers aged 14 and 15 suffered moderate 
gunshot wounds in clashes with soldiers in the gaza strip 
according to arab reports 
in jerusalem police detained a 14yearold palestinian girl who 
stabbed and injured an officer as he grabbed her during a 
stonethrowing demonstration city police spokesman uzi sandori 
said 
also thursday khaled naif abdeen 23 was axed to death in the 
town of khan yunis in the gaza strip apparently as a suspected 
collaborator with israeli authorities the reports said the army 
confirmed the slaying but said the circumstances were unclear 
the fatalities raised the death toll to 521 palestinians killed 
by israeli soldiers or civilians and 85 killed by fellow arabs 
during the 19monthold uprising against israeli rule thirtyeight 
israelis also have died in the unrest 
in his speech broadcast on israel radio shamir said american 
leaders tried to persuade me to include in the initiative as one 
of its principle parts conceding part of the land of israel even 
with a hint using the diplomatic words land for peace 
i rejected this wholeheartedly because i say and believe it is 
possible to reach peace without heaven forbid giving up a grain 
of the holy land of our forefathers shamir said as he was heard 
pounding his fist on a table 
he also vowed to continue jewish settlement building in the 
occupied territories despite persistent warnings from the us 
that the settlements are an obstacle to peace 
we will stand by their the settlers side and build many 
jewish settlements all over the land of israel shamir said 
but hardliners in shamirs rightwing likud bloc criticized his 
latest meetings with palestinians charging he was circumventing a 
government boycott of the plo israeli reports said 
the criticism of shamir followed reports that a proplo lawyer 
from the west bank town of ramallah jamil tarifi had met the 
israeli prime minister secretly this month 
the plos news agency wafa said in tunis thursday that the 
meeting with tarifi was with the knowledge and approval of the 
palestinian leadership 
shamir has acknowledged meeting with palestinians saying the 
talks were aimed only at finding dialogue partners outside the plo 
israel rejects dialogue with the plo claiming it is a terrorist 
organization bent on the countrys destruction 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the meetings were 
productive despite a wide gap between israeli and palestinian 
positions 
there are signs of a relaxation in the air rabin said on 
television referring to a decline in violent incidents in the 
disputed lands there are signs of increasing desire to move the 
process from a violent conflict to a political solution 
in his remarks to the egyptian newspaper arafat said israels 
election plan was a good idea but said it should lead to 
formation of a palestinian state 
he also called for a partial israeli troop withdrawal in advance 
of elections un supervision of balloting a total israeli 
pullout and repatriation of palestinian refugees 
israel has rejected all these positions 
in the gaza strip meanwhile four prominent doctors urged the 
united states to play a greater role in pressuring israel to make 
concessions 
lawyer zuhair elrais a founding member of the plo said he 
told us ambassador to tel aviv william brown america must be a 
full partner to the peace process they must put more pressure on 
israel and practice a more balanced policy toward palestinians

eightyone house democrats complained to 
president bush thursday that his partys campaign operatives are 
beating up on them politically for voting to support white house 
positions 
the most recent example they said is a spate of news releases 
mailed into democrats home districts accusing them of going 
awol in the war on drugs because they supported bush in 
opposing a random drugtesting amendment for state department 
employees 
to pursue your agenda you need our votes the lawmakers 
wrote in a blunt letter to the president that reminded him of an 
inaugural pledge to extend a hand to the democratcontrolled 
congress many democrats have tried to reciprocate it said 
having ones outstretched hand slashed so ferociously and so 
deceitfully does not nurture an inclination to reach out at the 
next invitation the letter stated 
i hate to say its a conspiracy said rep richard 
stallings didaho who organized the letterwriting effort along 
with rep peter hoagland dneb but its happened too often 
its no longer just a coincidence 
the most recent example of alleged backstabbing came over the 
june 28 drugtesting vote bushs state department opposed the 
amendment saying it was unnecessary and duplicated existing laws 
the department already has a drugtesting plan in the works it 
argued in two position papers sent to capitol hill 
rep gerald solomon rny the measures sponsor urged 
colleagues to support the measure anyway so they could go back to 
your districts this fourth of july and proudly say the congress 
took a first step in declaring war on their drug use 
the amendment narrowly failed 212 to 204 with 177 democrats 
joining 35 republicans to help bushs position prevail 
just a day later the national republican congressional 
committee dispatched news releases to the districts of 21 democrats 
saying of each when the time came for action instead of 
rhetoric he flunked the test none of the 35 republicans who 
supported bush was attacked 
the incident is part of an alarming pattern the lawmakers 
told bush 
we need your reciprocal assurance that when we vote with you 
on difficult issues at your personal request or at the request of 
members of your administration we will not find that bipartisan 
spirit so shamelessly betrayed as it was in this instance 
gop political operatives from republican national committee 
chairman lee atwater to nrcc head edward j rollins have come 
increasingly into the spotlight this year for harsh attacks on 
democratic lawmakers 
similar news releases were sent out criticizing 22 democrats who 
opposed an amendment to cut 45000 from the national endowment for 
the arts for its support of two controversial art projects

insecticides intended to combat a grasshopper 
infestation have killed destroyed millions of honeybees in 
minnesota creating potential losses of honey and of the crops that 
bees pollinate 
extensive spraying has curbed grasshoppers that thrived during 
the past two drought years said state agriculture commissioner jim 
nichols but it also has killed bees by the millions 
i dont blame the farmers for trying to save their crops 
said dale bauer a beekeeper from fertile i blame the regulatory 
authorities of the state of minnesota the regulations in this 
state are too loose 
in the past three weeks bauer has waded through dead bees up to 
3 inches deep to inspect his 4000 bee colonies in several 
northwestern counties he estimates that 500 of his colonies were 
destroyed and 700 damaged 
a colony is worth about 100 and usually houses more than 50000 
bees by july meaning at least 25 million bees died in bauers 
apiary several other beekeepers have reported heavy losses to 
blane white state bee inspector 
minnesota extension service entomologist dave noetzel said some 
land had to be treated more than once and large numbers of 
grasshoppers still threaten crops partly because they still are 
hatching 
noetzel said farmers and applicators may have ignored advice to 
use sprays least toxic to bees the bees also may have died because 
farmers sprayed too close to beehives or during hours that bees are 
active in the fields 
there is no evidence that honey will contain residues from the 
pesticides white said but it is a definite area of concern 
the state will monitor 
whats more likely is a sharp drop in the states honey crop 
worth about 10 million last year yields of sunflowers and 
soybeans also may fall because there are fewer bees and other 
insects to pollinate them white said 
agriculture commissioner nichols said drought relief measures 
pending before congress should reimburse beekeepers and farmers for 
spraying costs expected to reach 35 million 
much of the controversy surrounding the spraying stems from a 
new state law that empowers townships in designated control 
zones to order spraying of infested areas where crops are 
threatened 
if a landowner balks authorities can spray the property and add 
the costs to the owners tax bill since early june 662 townships 
in 37 counties roughly the western half of the state have been 
declared control zones 
farmers and local officials in the zones are allowed to spray 
any insecticide approved by the environmental protection agency 
state and federal law requires them to follow label directions 
intended to minimize the impact on bees and wildlife

the united states joined other security 
council members thursday in calling for the disbanding of the 
nicaraguan rebel forces as part of the central american peace plan 
the us policy shift was balanced by the resolutions appeal to 
all nations to halt military aid to guerrillas in the region 
however the resolution specifically allows continued humanitarian 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
we call upon the governments of nicaragua and cuba to cease 
their nineyear supply of weapons ammunition safe haven and other 
lethal assistance to the fmln insurgents in el salvador said 
us ambassador herbert s okun 
the fmln is the farabundo marti national liberation front the 
marxist rebels fighting to overthrow el salvadors conservative 
government 
okun said the united states voted for the resolution to show 
support for the central american peace plan and for nicaraguas 
plans to hold national elections in 1990 
the last time the security council considered the guerrilla wars 
in central america was in 1985 until thursday the united states 
had prevented consideration of the issue 
as recently as last spring state department spokesmen said 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government had to adopt an array of 
democratic reforms before the 11000member contra forces would be 
disbanded 
on tuesday though the us state departments assistant 
secretary in charge of interamerican affairs bernard aronson 
would not rule out the possibility of disbanding and repatriating 
the force before nicaraguas elections 
aronson said a repatriation plan could be carried out when 
there are conditions that protect the security of the resistance 
and their democratic rights 
most of the contras have been living with their families in 
honduran border camps since congress halted military aid to them in 
february 1988 
the security council resolution appeals to all nations which 
either openly or covertly supply aid to irregular forces or 
insurrectional movements in the area to immediately halt such 
aid with the exception of the humanitarian aid that the united 
states is sending to the contras 
the 15member council adopted the resolution by consensus it 
also called on the central american presidents to continue carrying 
out their 1987 peace plan which calls for democracy in the 
regions nations and an end to guerrilla wars 
the united nations and organization of american states have 
agreed to provide poll watchers for presidential and parliamentary 
elections in nicaragua set for feb 25 1990 
nicaragua honduras el salvador guatemala and costa rica also 
have asked the united nations to send a border patrol force to the 
region to assure that no nation is used as a base by rebels seeking 
to overthrow a neighboring countrys government 
that agreement reached feb 14 at a summit meeting in el 
salvador has been stalled by a dispute between nicaragua and 
honduras over the procedure for implementing it 
the permanent members of the security council are the united 
states soviet union britain france and china the current 
temporary members are algeria brazil canada colombia ethiopia 
finland malaysia nepal senegal and yugoslavia

consumer groups accused eastern airlines on 
thursday of scheduling phantom flights that never take off and 
said travelers should be particularly cautious of eastern schedules 
beginning next week 
were providing information travelers have to take into 
account to decide for themselves whether to fly eastern said 
cornish hitchcock a spokesman for public citizen 
the 50000member group which takes proconsumer stands on a 
variety of issues along with the aviation consumer action project 
also said eastern has far more complaints than other airlines has 
a poor record of making ticket refunds and is disregarding federal 
aviation administration recommendations by putting inexperienced 
pilots and copilots aboard the same plane 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said in miami that the allegations 
were silly 
he acknowledged that the airline has zeroed out some 
scheduled flights by stopping ticket sales but said that was done 
only to protect consumers since crews would not be available 
ashlock also said that eastern had planned to increase from 225 
daily flights to 390 next tuesday but that the number would be 
held at about 350 until midaugust because of the inability to 
train enough pilots by the first of the month before the strike 
the airline had flown about 1000 flights a day 
he said the high number of complaints recorded by the 
transportation department was not a reflection of current problems 
but stemmed from the immediate aftermath of the march 4 walkout by 
machinists pilots and flight attendants which led the airline to 
file for reorganizaton under bankruptcy laws the court has power 
over ticket refunds he said 
ashlock said the airline is following all faa requirements in 
training and assigning pilots 
we wouldnt want to break any faa rules and we couldnt if we 
did want to ashlock said 
if two relatively new pilots are acting as captain and first 
officer of a flight they would be allowed to fly only in clear 
weather and would have to follow procedures even stricter than 
those required by the faa he said many of the newly hired pilots 
have long experience he said 
hitchcock at a public citizen news conference maintained most 
of easterns phantom flights are scheduled out of atlanta when 
passengers try to buy tickets they are told the flights are sold 
out when actually they are not going to fly at all he charged 
more broadly what does this practice tell us about easterns 
ability to rebuild operations and offer dependable scheduled 
service hitchcock asked 
he also said passengers should be aware that a bankruptcy court 
decision earlier this month setting up a 5 million reimbursement 
fund for travel agents may be acting as an incentive for agents to 
sell eastern tickets the agreement he said requires that eastern 
increase the fund only if agents sell more than 36 million in 
eastern tickets each week 
from a passengers standpoint this agreement raises 
serious conflictofinterest issues hitchcock said 
he also said that if passengers do miss an eastern flight or it 
is cancelled they may not be able to get refunds from other 
airlines because many do not honor eastern tickets 
ashlock acknowledged this might be true of some airlines but 
said it is because easterns fares are so low he said the airline 
participates fully in ticketpooling agreements 
all our credentials are in place and the money is good he 
said

union leaders thursday accepted an 88 percent pay 
raise from staterun british rail and suspended a series of oneday 
pay strikes that have intermittently paralyzed rail service 
jimmy knapp general secretary of the national union of 
railwaymen announced the decision after a sevenhour meeting among 
union leaders 
he said the decision would preserve the high level of unity 
shown during the labor dispute over pay and collective bargaining 
knapp said talks would continue with british rail on retaining a 
system of national negotiations on pay and working conditions the 
company wants to replace collective bargaining with local 
agreements 
sir robert reid british rail chairman said i am very 
pleased that they have accepted our offer like the other two 
unions the locomotive engineers and the ticket clerks 
the decision to end the strikes came amid signs of a crack in 
worker solidarity wednesday when 12500 of the 72000 railmen 
turned up for their jobs during the sixth 24hour walkout in six 
weeks according to company estimates 
the union had sought a 10 percent pay increase for its members 
they initially received considerable support from the public 
angered also by condition of the rundown national rail network 
british rail initially offered workers a 7 percent raise 
but public exasperation with the lack of trains has mounted and 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party urged 
railwaymen to end their strikes 
railwaymen are among britains lowest paid industrial workers 
with overtime drivers earn the equivalent of about 485 a week 
while other railroad workers earn 335 weekly 
a train drivers dispute over pay and working conditions will 
continue on the london subway which carries about 1 million 
passengers daily

soweto in one of five explosions around johannesburg on thursday 
an antiapartheid activists home in an impoverished black 
township was firebombed in one of the attacks 
no serious injuries were reported in any of the blasts 
police spokesman col frans malherbe said the black man who 
planted the bomb was killed in the explosion on the main 
sowetojohannesburg rail line about 9 pm there was no 
information on damage 
malherbe also said a limpet mine exploded in a parking building 
next to the jg strijdom hospital which is reserved for whites 
there were no cars nearby and it caused no injuries or damage he 
said 
at 1130 pm another explosion went off in deserted downtown 
johannesburg but malherbe provided no further details 
earlier thursday an antiapartheid activists home in the 
impoverished black township of alexandra on the northern edge of 
johannesburg and a nearby residence for black nurses were damaged 
in what witnesses said were firebomb attacks 
law and order minister adriaan vlok announced earlier this week 
that militant antiapartheid groups would be mounting a sabotage 
and protest campaign against sept 6 elections for parliament it 
includes houses for whites asians and people of mixed race but 
excludes representatives of the black majority of 28 million south 
africas blacks have no vote in national affairs decided by the 5 
million white minority 
the outlawed african national congress has called for boycotts 
of elections for the mixedrace and asian parliament races 
antiapartheid organizations inside the country have called for 
protests against the balloting and a mass defiance campaign against 
racist laws such as those segregating hospitals schools and 
residential areas 
police have not said who they suspect in the explosions and no 
one has claimed responsibility both government and antigovernment 
institutions have been targets of bombings in the past three years 
police confirmed the predawn fire at a house for nurses 
employed by the alexandra health clinic but said the blaze may 
have been caused by an electrical fault 
several nurses reportedly suffered cuts and bruises and staff 
said two men one black and one white were seen fleeing from the 
scene shortly before an explosion occurred 
the human rights commission an independent antiapartheid 
group said the home of alexandra youth group leader paul mashidile 
was damaged by a firebomb early thursday the commission said

released in recent months is required to be at his home between 6 
pm and 6 am 
mashidile who was unhurt told the star newspaper of 
johannesburg that he found a container of gasoline outside the 
house after being awoken by the fire which broke out about 15 
minutes after the explosion at the nurses residence

william lucas denied a new unverified charge 
about his commitment to civil rights on thursday as the senate 
judiciary committee postponed a vote on his nomination for a key 
justice department post 
sen howell heflin dala who holds a pivotal vote requested 
the committee delay its decison so he could look into unidentified 
lastminute information i dont want to injure anybody the 
allegations are not substantiated he said 
congressional sources circulated a letter from attorney michael 
sussman of yonkers ny saying lucas had telephoned the justice 
department to urge it to drop a 1980 lawsuit against birmingham 
mich charging fair housing act violations 
other lawmakers said they were mystified about what new 
information was bothering heflin and there was no certainty that it 
was the letter from sussman 35 who is currently representing the 
national association for the advancement of colored people in a 
landmark yonkers desegregation case 
david runkel a spokesman for attorney general dick thornburgh 
issued a denial from lucas and described the allegation as 
reprehensible and a lastminute tactic designed to kill the 
nomination 
lucas 61 is seeking senate confirmation as assistant attorney 
general for civil rights the former wayne county mich official 
who is black has come under fire from some civil rights leaders as 
unqualified and the issue has ballooned into a fullscale 
political fight with the bush administration 
the full senate is likely to settle the matter regardless of 
what happens in committee but the administration wants a favorable 
recommendation from the panel and the intensity of the campaign has 
put the spotlight on the issue 
eight votes are needed for a favorable recommendation vote 
counters on both sides say lucas probably can rely on seven with 
heflin a question mark 
at the judiciary committee meeting republican senators pushed 
for an immediate vote with sen alan k simpson rwyo 
complaining that delay would give these extraordinary groups time 
to just go out and keep ginning it up and find out what he did 
when he was 16 
we need to bring balance to these things as we diddle around 
with people and leave them hanging simpson said 
heflin warned republicans however that if there were immediate 
action im prepared to vote but i may not vote the way you want 
me to vote 
i wouldnt want to push him said sen strom thurmond 
rsc the ranking republican on the committee 
any senator can postpone such a vote for one week but chairman 
joseph biden ddel said the committee definitely would reach its 
decision tuesday 
reacting to the panels action thornburgh spokesman runkel said 
that the justice department remains confident that lucas will be 
confirmed 
a leading lucas critic ralph neas executive director of the 
leadership conference on civil rights said he remained confident 
that the nominee eventually would be defeated 
sussman said in his letter that he was not personally the 
recipient of mr lucass call but i distinctly recall discussing 
it with my supervisor 
at the time i was thoroughly immersed in the case and 
consequently in the political climate of the region he said 
it particularly struck me that mr lucas who then was sheriff 
of wayne county and a political figure familiar to me from my 
frequent visits to the area would attempt to intervene on behalf 
of the defendant white officeholders 
sussman said the case which was filed in april 1980 later was 
decided in favor of the government by a us district court 
runkel told reporters lucas denies that he ever had anything 
to do with the birmingham case he was the sheriff of wayne county 
this was a city in a different county 
runkel said a check of a department correspondence file on the 
case revealed no letters from lucas 
sussman reached in new york said he recalls lucas made a 
telephone call possibly to his supervisor joel selig three to 
four weeks after the lawsuit was filed 
selig reached at his home at laramie wyo said he did not 
recall anything about a telephone call from lucas concerning the 
birmingham case

saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggi was 
freed from a federal jail thursday after posting 10 million bail 
so he could live in his luxury apartment with an electronic 
bracelet limiting his movements 
khashoggi who had been in custody since his april 18 arrest in 
switzerland promised to stay in the country to face charges that 
he helped imelda and ferdinand marcos defraud the philippine 
treasury 
before being whisked away in a limousine khashoggi read a 
handwritten statement to a crush of photographers reporters and 
spectators i am pleased that the courts have granted me bail i 
am anxious to begin work for my defense and look forward to 
clearing my name at trial 
the limousine took khashoggi from his 75foot jail cell to the 
30000squarefoot apartment he owns in the luxury olympic towers 
building on fifth avenue a piedaterre carved out of 16 separate 
apartments among its luxuries is a swimming pool that overlooks 
the spires of st patricks cathedral 
he must wear an electronic bracelet part of a system that would 
alert authorities if he ventured beyond a prescribed distance he 
also was ordered to surrender his passport and not travel outside 
manhattan the bronx and the citys northern suburbs 
his bail money came in the form of two 5 million checks one of 
the barclays bank checks was signed by his brother essam 
khashoggi and the other by his halfbrother amr khashoggi 
the bail was posted after an appeals judge refused to revoke a 
bail package granted khashoggi earlier in the week 
us district judge john keenan warned khashoggi that if he 
flees he could be tried in absentia and could be prosecuted for 
jumping bail 
i want to assure your honor that i will abide because i 
cherish the relationship with america khashoggi told the judge 
keenan set a march 14 trial date for khashoggi and his 
codefendants 
khashoggi 54 has been in jail in new york since his 
extradition july 19 from switzerland where he was arrested on 
april 18 
prosecutors had opposed khashoggis release because they claimed 
he had concealed his true wealth and was likely to flee judge 
william pierce of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals denied the 
appeal and upheld keenans bail package 
the saudibased national commercial bank filed a foreclosure 
suit last month on khashoggis apartment which has been featured 
in house amp garden magazine but us district judge john keenan 
said tuesday that defense lawyers had told the court the bank has 
given khashoggi a year to clear up the 287 million default 
khashoggi the marcoses five other people and the california 
overseas bank in los angeles were indicted last october the 
marcoses were accused of stealing more than 100 million from the 
philippine treasury to buy real estate and art in new york 
khashoggi who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the 
assets as a cover was indicted on charges of racketeering 
conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of justice however the 
swiss government agreed to extradite him only on the last two 
charges 
he faces up to five years in jail and a 250000 fine on each of 
the two charges of mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
khashoggi also is said to have been the main financier and 
middleman of the irancontra affair in which proceeds of illegal 
us arms sales to iran went to rebels fighting the nicaraguan 
government

president carlos menem hinted 
strongly thursday he will pardon military officers who face trial 
on charges of abusing human rights during the 197683 dictatorship 
im not going to walk to congress with a law under my arm 
asking that they approve it menem said what former president 
raul alfonsin did not do i will do 
the convictions of seven officers and the possibility of more 
trials led to three barracks revolts against alfonsin who left 
office on july 8 following his defeat in the may presidential 
election 
menem repeatedly has said he will resolve the impasse with the 
military although he has refused to say how or when his advisers 
have said the government was leaning toward forgiving soldiers 
involved in the human rights abuses and the uprisings 
on wednesday defense minister italo luder confirmed that 
authorities had dropped disciplinary proceedings against several 
hundred soldiers who took part in army insurrections in april 1987 
and in january and december 1988 
lowerranking officers were given minor sanctions and sent 
back to their units luder said he did not specify what the 
penalties were 
the objectives of these acts of indiscipline were shared by 
all the armed forces luder said the comment suggested that the 
government believes reconciliation with the armed forces would be 
difficult if the officers were punished 
no one has been tried in the revolts however uprising leaders 
lt col aldo rico and col mohamed ali seineldin and six other 
officers have been in military prison since the revolts were put 
down by negotiation they caused little bloodshed 
menems comments thursday were to several local reporters he 
invited to breakfast at government house they were reported by the 
independent news agency noticias argentinas 
menem has three main choices in the case of officers charged 
with human rights abuses a presidential pardon a congressional 
amnesty or to move ahead with the trials of 15 generals and three 
admirals that have been deferred for months he has never spoken in 
favor of the last option but has not said he ruled it out 
the issue bedeviled the government of alfonsin who was elected 
in october 1983 to replace a military dictatorship 
ricos insurrections in april 1987 and january 1988 were aimed 
at ending the civilian trials of officers accused of human rights 
abuses during the 197683 military dictatorships crackdown on 
leftist subversion about 8900 people who disappeared during the 
period are presumed dead 
in june 1987 the alfonsin government passed a law that 
sheltered from prosecution all but the highest officers accused of 
human rights abuses 
seineldin led a rebellion in december 1988 that he said was 
carried out to draw attention to soldiers low pay and poor 
equipment the issue of trying officers also played a role however

an airline passengers group thursday called for 
the grounding of all dc10 jetliners in the united states until any 
structural deficiencies are fixed but federal regulators and the 
aircraft maker rejected the call 
the international airline passengers association wants the 
federal aviation administration to order the planes out of use in 
the wake of the july 19 crash of a united airlines dc10 in sioux 
city iowa that killed 111 said spokesman daniel smith 
we expect nothing less than structural modification of these 
aircraft said smith we cannot wait any longer to get the kind 
of changes that need to be made 
citing the sioux city crash smith said it is evident that the 
aircrafts dual hydraulic systems necessary for flight control do 
not work and the systems need to be separate 
iapa wants to first find out whats wrong with the aircraft 
and secondly get it fixed said a letter delivered thursday to 
faa chief james busey in washington 
smith said the organization has not ruled out court action to 
get the planes grounded but in the letter said we believe it is 
far better for you to act independently free of any imposed 
direction from outside the faa 
john leyden a federal aviation administration spokesman in 
washington rejected the demand that the planes be grounded 
theres nothing thats come out of the sioux city accident 
indicating a basic design flaw that would warrant such an action 
leyden said 
also on thursday a korean air dc10 crashed short of a fogbound 
airport in tripoli libya killing at least 82 people however a 
spokesman for the south korean embassy there said no mechanical 
problem was reported prior to the crash 
within hours of the iapa announcement mcdonnell douglas the 
maker of the dc10 countered with its own press conference at the 
long beach headquarters of douglas aircraft 
i find it difficult to believe that a rational public a 
rational faa and even a rational congress will put very much 
credence in the statements of the iapa said dale warren a 
mcdonnell douglas vice president 
the real concern in my opinion is that we worry about the 
credibility of our aircraft to the traveling public warren said 
wed like to assure the traveling public that we have a fine 
piece of aircraft that is safe to travel in 
nevertheless warren said engineers are studying the crashes to 
determine whether a design modification is needed 
it would appear at this time that some action is 
appropriate warren said 
among possible changes under consideration are additional backup 
controls ways of containing the damage from a jet engine explosion 
and methods of shielding the hydraulic system from such damage 
an initial investigation into the iowa crash indicates that an 
explosion in the rear engine threw pieces of the turbine through 
the tail section rupturing the hydraulic controls and backup 
systems 
smith also claimed there are other design deficiencies in the 
planes which entered commercial fleets in 1971 
at least 17 or 38 percent of the 445 dc10s built have been 
wrecked because of their problems smith said by comparison 12 
percent of the lockheed l1011s have been wrecked and 15 percent 
of the boeing 747s have crashed he said 
the passengers association cited the iowa crash as well as other 
dc10 accidents 
1974 a turkish airlines jet near paris crashed after 
explosive decompression and severed hydraulic lines 346 killed 
1979 an american airlines jet crashed on takeoff in chicago 
after the number one engine separated from the wing rupturing 
hydraulic lines connected to the wing slats 273 died 
mcdonnell douglas technical experts have been sent to tripoli in 
hopes of entering libya to assist in the investigation of the 
korean air crash there warren said 
presently there is no indication that the circumstances of the 
tripoli and sioux city accidents are related nor that they relate 
to previous dc10 accidents he said

women who ingest even moderate amounts of 
caffeine appear to be more susceptible to premenstrual syndrome an 
oregon state university researcher says 
a study by annette rossignol associate professor of public 
health showed that women who drink half a cup to four cups of tea 
a day were twice as likely to experience pms when the caffeine 
intake was increased to 4 to eight cups a day the incidence of 
pms rose nearly tenfold 
rossignol noted thursday that the tea used in the study 
contained less caffeine than would be found in a cup of brewed 
coffee or in some soft drinks 
pms which occurs in the second half of the menstrual cycle can 
cause depression fatigue irritability anxiety headaches 
swelling or tenderness of the breasts and craving for sweet or 
salty foods 
the cause of pms is unknown but it affects about 70 percent of 
women aged 18 and older with 10 to 15 percent of the women 
experiencing severe or disabling symptoms rossignol said 
rossignol said some researchers have suggested factors affecting 
pms may include diet hormonal imbalance alcohol and tobacco use 
oral contraceptives and lack of exercise 
her research four years ago found a possible correlation between 
pms and caffeine 
one problem in studying caffeine and pms is that unhealthy 
habits tend to cluster she said people who drink a lot of 
caffeinecontaining beverages may also smoke drink alcohol be 
prone to a lack of exercise or have poor dietary habits it was 
difficult to isolate the caffeine factor in association with pms 
she said she eliminated those factors in her latest research 
when she codirected a study of women nursing students and workers 
in a tea factory in rural areas of china 
the women did not drink alcoholic beverages they did not 
smoke there was no coffee or cola in the rural area of china they 
did not use oral contraceptives and they exercised every day 
riding their bikes to work rossignol said 
results of rossignols study were published in the american 
journal of public health in january 
rossignol emphasized that caffeine may not cause pms but it may 
contribute to the onset of its symptoms or make them more severe 
pms is very difficult to measure because it affects women 
differently she said there is no test for pms you cannot 
take a blood test or see it on an xray most diagnostic procedures 
require keeping a daily diary and looking at the pattern of 
symptoms over time 
further studies are necessary to determine if pms has a genetic 
link and whether caffeine causes it or contributes to the severity 
of the symptoms rossignol said 
i suspect that there is a constellation of causes of pms 
she said

no scrap parts were used in the engine 
that apparently failed in last weeks united airlines dc10 crash 
in sioux city iowa the engines maker general electric co said 
thursday 
dwight weber a spokesman at the ge plant in suburban cincinnati 
which produced the crashed jets three cf66 engines rejected a 
suggestion by rep john dingell dmich that ge used old parts in 
new production engines 
the parts dingell refers to we can categorically say were 
not used in the flight 232 engine weber said ge does not use 
recycled parts in new production engines however repaired parts 
are commonly used in overhauled engines 
dingell in a letter wednesday asked the federal aviation 
administration to investigate whether scrap parts were used in the 
tail engine of the united jet that crashed july 19 iowa killing 
111 people dingell chairs a house energy and commerce subcomittee 
which oversees such investigations 
ge says the cf66 engine produced from 1971 to 1981 for use 
specifically on dc10 series 10 jets such as the crashed united 
jet has established a reliable safety record during 17 million 
hours of commercial flight ge stopped making the cf66 engine and 
started producing successor models after mcdonnell douglas sold the 
last of its dc10 series 10 jets weber said 
dingells letter asks a response from the faa by aug 4 dingell 
told reporters thursday in washington that he is not making 
allegations against manufacturers but wants a government 
assessment of the issue 
were simply following up on an inquiry we made to the faa 
several years ago in which we asked them to look into the problems 
of spare parts we have no information and are making no 
allegations about the behavior of any manufacturer dingell said 
national transportation safety board investigator jack young was 
at ges evendale plant thursday to examine ges manufacturing 
records for the tailmounted no 2 engine of flight 232 its fan 
section disintegrated about 45 minutes into the flight from denver 
to chicago and federal investigators want to know why said ntsb 
spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
lopatkiewicz said wreckage of the engine is to be transported 
probably next week from the iowa crash site to ge evendale for a 
thorough teardown examination under ntsb supervision 
lopatkiewicz said the no 2 engines fan section was missing 
from the wreckage he said there was debris penetration damage in 
the planes horizontal stabilizers and two of three hydraulic 
systems had been severed severely impairing steering of the jet 
weber also said a different generation of ges cf6 series 
engines powered a korean air dc10 jet which crashed early thursday 
in heavy fog three miles short of the tripoli libya reportedly 
killing about half of the 200 people on board the korean plane was 
powered by ges cf650 engines a higherthrust model which entered 
commercial service in october 1972 weber said

the senate on thursday voted against delaying 
the new surtax on medicare recipients as opponents of the 
catastrophic care program for the elderly tried once again to roll 
back major parts of it for a year 
on a 5840 procedural vote the lawmakers rejected an amendment 
by sen john mccain rariz to an energy and water spending bill 
that would have cut off a major source of funds for the 
catastrophic care program 
the vote is unlikely to be the last one on the issue which has 
drawn protests from many elderly americans who have complained that 
the levy is too expensive a house committee voted this week to 
halve the surtax and a senate panel is studying the catastrophic 
care program and its costs 
the senate vote came on a day that richard darman the white 
houses budget director indicated that the bush administration was 
willing to make a deal on rolling back the catastrophic program 
were in the process of compromising on that he told 
reporters at a breakfast gathering 
darman provided no details the administration has opposed a 
total repeal of the program 
mccains proposal would also have postponed other segments of 
the program including a prescription drug benefit and a ceiling it 
places on doctors bills the elderly must pay 
the surtax is what has created the firestorm out there said 
mccain whose state is home to many elderly citizens 
last month mccain lost an effort to attach identical language 
to another spending bill and was defeated by a single vote 
his loss was by a greater margin this time as senate leaders of 
both parties and of the senate finance committee which has 
jurisdiction over taxes and health programs teamed up against 
him fifteen of the 19 members of the finance committee who voted 
on the mccain amendment opposed it including six of nine 
republicans 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
angrily reminded mccain that the finance panel had promised to 
study the program last month a review that is still under way 
to have you come in at the last minute to try to cut that 
short after the extended debate we had and the decision of this 
body i frankly think its a serious mistake bentsen said 
currently the law passed just last year requires the 33 
million people eligible for medicare to pay a surtax of 15 percent 
on the federal taxes they owe above 150 a cap of 800 was placed 
on the amount any individual would owe this year 
only 40 percent of the elderly would be required to pay any 
surtax at all and less than 6 percent would have to pay the 
maximum of 800 on wednesday the house ways and means committee 
voted to cut the surtax in half and to make participation in the 
catastrophic program voluntary if a person was willing to give up 
medicare coverage for doctors bills

dirty air spread last year with 30 million 
more americans living in areas where they breathed levels of air 
pollutants the government considers harmful the environmental 
protection agency said thursday 
the agency said the latest figures which cover the recent 
threeyear period mean that at least 101 areas will be required to 
take additional air pollution control measures under new clean air 
legislation that is likely to emerge from congress this year 
in all about 110 million people better than four of every 10 
americans were breathing air that at least during some summer 
days in 1988 had smog levels considered to be unhealthful 
according to the epa figures the year earlier the number was about 
80 million 
the epa attributed the higher levels last year of ozone a 
principal component of smog largely to the fact that the country 
suffered through one of the hottest summers in half a century 
ozone is created when hydrocarbons mainly from automobiles 
combine with severe heat and dust 
all but two of the 37 new areas where ozone levels exceeded 
federal standards were east of the mississippi where the 1988 
summer was particularly severe in 44 areas the air also had 
unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide slightly fewer than previous 
years 
severe smog pollution can cause a variety of respiratory 
ailments including impaired breathing and chest pain while 
longterm exposure can cause permanent lung tissue damage 
according to medical experts 
while the unusually hot 1988 summer may have been largely to 
blame for the surge in air pollution epa officials said the 
statistics reinforce the need for swift action in congress on 
legislation tightening air pollution controls 
this sharp increase in the number of areas not yet meeting the 
ozone standard is dramatic proof of the pressing need for a new 
clean air bill said epa administrator william reilly 
the problem is immense we must address it now he said 
the 1988 figures will be used by the epa in determining what 
action a state will require of local communities to clean up the 
air under new federal air pollution laws being debated on capitol 
hill 
william rosenberg epas associate administrator for air said 
that while some of the targeted communities may again come into 
compliance if the summer heat eases most of the 101 geographic 
regions will have to impose additional pollution controls under the 
expected clean air legislation 
president bush in june proposed a sweeping revision of the 
federal air pollution laws including increased use of alternative 
motor fuels in areas facing the most severe ozone and carbon 
monoxide threat 
environmentalists recently accused the administration of backing 
off from some of the original proposal a claim heatedly denied 
thursday by rosenberg who maintained that the proposed bill sent to 
congress by the president would bring all but four of the 101 
georgraphic areas into compliance by the year 2000 and cost the 
public millions of dollars less than competing versions 
the administrations clean air legislation was introduced in the 
house thursday night with the chief sponsorship of house energy 
and commerce committee chairman john d dingell dmich and the 
ranking republican on the committee rep norman lent of new york 
they were joined by 145 cosponsors including 89 republicans 
and 56 democrats 
democrats have introduced their own clean air legislation but 
rosenberg said he is confident a compromise can be worked out 
under the administration proposal before congress the four 
metropolitan areas with the most severe pollution in 1988 the new 
york chicago houston and los angeles areas would be required to 
phase in automobiles using alternative fuels as well take other 
pollution control measures 
the four areas would be given 20 years to come into compliance 
chicago was added to the four after the final 1988 ozone figures 
were tabulated while the other three have for some time been 
considered to have the nations worst air pollution 
another 27 cities are considered by the epa to have serious 
ozone pollution under the presidents proposal they would have 10 
years to come into compliance by tightening auto emission 
inspections the use of alternative fuels in some cases and curbs 
on pollutants in some businesses such as bakeries and dry cleaners 
as well as in refueling cars at gas pumps 
these areas would be required to establish a program of 
pollution control to reduce emissions by 3 percent a year until 
they attain compliance with the federal standard 
ozone pollution in the remaining areas was described as moderate 
or marginal and would require lesssevere action to correct 
officials said 
the worsening pollution for ozone in 1988 was tempered somewhat 
by a net decrease in carbon monoxide pollution although 44 areas 
still exceeded those federal standards as well the epa said

a key plutonium production plant at the 
hanford nuclear reservation will remain closed at least until 
september but will not hurt the nations ability to make nuclear 
weapons officials said thursday 
john fulton manager of the chemical division for westinghouse 
hanford co told the associated press that the plutoniumuranium 
extraction plant which closed dec 7 would resume operation in 
late september or early october 
also thursday hanford manager mike lawrence blasted a citizens 
group which contended that us department of energy officials 
tried to hide the lengthy shutdown of the plant known as purex 
its extremely clear that the purex shutdown was not done 
quietly or secretively lawrence said responding to the 
spokanebased hanford education action leagues complaint last week 
purex is the latest major link in the nations nuclear weapons 
production chain to close joining hanfords n reactor and 
facilities at the savannah river plant in south carolina the feed 
materials production facility in fernald ohio and the rocky flat 
plant near denver 
the purex plant dissolves nuclear fuel rods from weapons 
reactors to extract the plutonium and uranium the plutonium is 
further processed before it is placed in nuclear weapons 
the nations only other plutoniumuranium extraction facilities 
are at savannah river and are still functional although they have 
little to do because reactors there are closed for safety reasons 
said becky mcswain a spokeswoman for the westinghouse savannah 
river co 
westinghouse operates the two giant nuclear production complexes 
for doe 
the purex closure will not hurt the nations nuclear capability 
said ken morgan of does richland office 
the exact size of the nuclear materials stockpile is secret but 
theres a great deal of stretch in the system morgan said 
officials for westinghouse hanford co on thursday produced 
copies of news releases dated to the dec 7 1988 closure of 
purex and also copies of the unusual occurrence reports filed 
in does public reading room in richland concerning the closure 
jim thomas a staff researcher for heal complained that only 
local media organizations in the tricities were notified and said 
that at minimum news organizations from throughout the state should 
have been told 
the unusual occurrence reports are written in such a way that 
they treat everything as an isolated incident thomas said 
its impossible to get the overall status of anything in a normal 
unusual occurrence report 
but bill whiting westinghouse hanford public relations officer 
said a variety of news organizations and elected officials were 
advised of the closure heal had not asked to be notified he said

paraplegic climber mark 
wellman fresh from conquering el capitan said thursday he 
constantly dreams of another feat walking again 
i visualize that im walking a lot in dreams and theres a lot 
behind that said wellman 29 who has had only partial movement 
in his legs since a climbing accident in 1982 
but really these days what with all ive been able to do it 
doesnt matter if im in a wheelchair but im always thinking 
about walking said the softspoken ranger but i admit its 
always a dream 
wellman a yosemite ranger who is an avid outdoorsman despite 
his disability told reporters atop the 3200foot face of el 
capitan on wednesday that his feat proves disabled people can 
accomplish almost anything they want 
wellman who hauled himself up the monolith using only his 
powerful arms said he did the climb for personal achievement not 
for the disabled but he said he hoped it would prove physical 
disabilities need not stop the handicapped 
go out and do it said wellman if you feel you can do 
it just go out and do it 
wellman was tired and sweaty when he reached the summit seven 
days and four hours after he and friend mike corbett 35 left the 
yosemite valley floor corbett a park medical clinic janitor who 
has scaled the monolith a recordbreaking 42 times is known as 
mr el cap 
to climb el capitan wellman and corbett used modified cave 
exploration equipment that allowed wellman to pull himself up the 
face of the cliff six inches at a time using a tbar device and 
ropes set by corbett and doing an estimated 7000 pullups 
but despite the historic nature of the climb the pair were 
almost nonchalant about their achievement 
wellman said there were no scary moments or even threatening 
situations although winds gusted up to 50 mph and temperatures 
rose to over 100 degrees on the rock face 
the climb mainly tested their raw strength but corbett said it 
also tested his patience with the outside world 
i felt like the whole world was watching he said one 
morning i had to go to the bathroom but i couldnt drop my drawers 
because of all the people looking up at me through their 
telescopes 
after the climb wellman took a casual ride down the back side 
of the mountain on a horse while corbett walked and jogged out the 
83mile route 
the us senate passed a resolution wednesday commending wellman 
and corbett the resolution authored by republican sen bob dole 
whose right arm is partially paralyzed commended them for their 
extraordinary feat of bravery and stoutheartedness

residents of this community were the 
first to return home after being evacuated because of forest fires 
that continued to burn thursday in central canada 
cross lakes 3600 residents returned on buses a week after 
fires forced nearly 25000 people from their homes in the regions 
indian communities and remote mining towns 
its a relief after a week out there sleeping on a hard cement 
floor in an arena said raymond robinson 28 after getting off a 
bus from the mining city of thompson he was sent there with his 
wife and five children 
it was really hard for her because she was almost due to have 
her baby robinson said 
emergency authorities announced wednesday that the fires near 
cross lake a community of wood bungalows nestled among trees and 
lakes about 280 miles north of winnipeg no longer posed a danger 
to the area and that evacuees could return 
but a wall of smoke from several fires burned in the distance 
thursday and about 20000 people mostly from manitoba but also 
from ontario to the east and saskatchewan to the west remained in 
makeshift accommodations 
there were 227 fires burning in manitoba 155 in saskatchewan 
and 188 in ontario some 5200 firefighters have been working to 
control the fires which have destroyed more than 37 million acres 
and are the worst in the regions memory 
no deaths or major injuries have been reported 
officials say it has cost about 25 million to battle the fires 
and that they could cost another 125 million in lost tourism 
fishing and logging 
manitoba emergency measures minister albert driedger said it was 
too early to say when the rest of the evacuees could return home 
itll be done very very cautiously so that we dont start 
allowing people back into their homes and then find out we have to 
get them back out again he said 
most of the affected communities are in rugged sparsely 
populated countryside 500 to 675 miles north of winnipeg the

heads turned necks craned and the nations 
business was momentarily put on hold thursday as the women who work 
at the white house sought a glimpse of president bushs visitor 
come to talk about the environment 
robert redford walked down the hall from the oval office and 
the entire building was abuzz 
bush had invited the actordirector to the white house when he 
heard redford was in town said rep robert dornan rcalif 
dornan said he brought redford who had campaigned last year for 
bushs democratic presidential opponent michael dukakis to the 
white house at the presidents bidding 
it all began wednesday when redford was at the capitol meeting 
with house speaker thomas foley regarding the actors efforts to 
obtain us permission to go to cuba to work on a movie 
dornan a onetime neighbor of the actor in santa monica calif 
was asked if he would help redford as well he agreed 
the congressman said he had just come from a capitol meeting 
with the man who is said to resemble redford vice president dan 
quayle and now an idea came to him 
within minutes he and foley redford in tow burst into the 
room where quayle was meeting with a group of members of congress 
mouths dropped open around the room as the two sandyhaired men 
met when quayle asked what redford was doing there the actor 
quipped im looking for a double 
quayles press secretary david beckwith said redford also told 
quayle he was trying to get an exemption from treasury department 
currency regulations that prevent most us citizens from visiting 
cuba 
that night bush saw dornan at a dinner and said he had heard 
about the encounter 
he said i heard you introduced robert redford to dan quayle 
why dont you bring him down to the white house dornan 
quoted the president as saying 
the congressman said their 40minute meeting focused on 
environmental matters an issue in which both bush and redford 
share an interest the actor has devoted much effort of a utah 
institute he founded toward mediation of environmental disputes 
dornan said bush told redford you have a strong following of 
people who love the environment and i do too maybe there are 
some things we could work together on 
within a few minutes they were like old friends although no 
specific projects were agreed to he added 
redford later told dornan bush has a wonderful opportunity 
here to be a hero on environmental matters 
the actor also met with secretary of state james a baker iii 
and treasury secretary nick brady in his effort to get the 
clearance to go to cuba and recorded narration for a wildlife 
series for the smithsonian museums dornan said 
redford won no commitments on his bid to go to cuba dornan said

the house approved a 295 billion defense bill 
thursday night that suspends most production of president bushs 
stealth bomber cuts money for star wars and strips out all 100 
million the administration sought for the midgetman missile 
by a vote of 261162 the house adopted a bill changed in the 
final minutes by an odd coalition of republicans angered by the 
cut of 502 million from the 11 billion the administration had 
requested for the mx missile and liberal democrats opposed to the 
planned midgetman missile 
the bill also includes money for the navys f14d jet fighter 
and the marine corps v22 osprey vertical takeoff assault 
transport two programs bush planned to scrap 
we got a michael dukakis defense bill rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee said 
shortly after the vote mike won the election no midgetman no 
rail mx big cuts in sdi and slow up the b2 bomber 
dukakis the democratic governor of massachusetts suffered a 
resounding defeat at the hands of bush in the 1988 presidential 
election 
but according to aspin the democraticcontrolled house carried 
out the losing candidates campaign pledges in crafting their 
version of the defense bill 
we have pretty well shredded george bushs strategic 
programs aspin said 
the senate on the other hand narrowly turned back an amendment 
that could have opened the door to deep cuts in the star wars 
budget the vote was 5047 to table and thus set aside the 
amendment 
the measure sponsored by sen bennett johnston dla would 
have frozen 362 billion of the bush administrations request for 
star wars adding only enough to cover 32 percent inflation 
the freeze would not have affected the the 26 billion 
earmarked for the department of energy in bushs 49 billion 
proposal for star wars in the new fiscal year 
vice president dan quayle hurried to the capitol and presided 
during the vote in case he was needed to break a tie 
in the house the final cut in the bush budget was the 100 
million the administration requested for the midgetman 
a cute thing happened after we voted to support the amendment 
for mx and midgetman a measure to gut the mx railgarrison 
said rep william dickinson rala ranking gop member on the 
house armed services committee in introducing a motion to recommit 
the defense bill to committee 
thats the game ok take out 500 million for railgarrison 
take out midgetman he said 
aspin in debate urged members not to approve a motion of 
spite but by a standing vote of 17690 the house approved the 
revision eliminating all the money for the singlewarhead midgetman 
missile 
later aspin said he spoke to cheney who had urged dickinson not 
to introduce the motion to recommit 
democrats generally support midgetman designed to move around 
on heavy trucks as a way to force the two superpowers to move 
toward singlewarhead missiles which would present less tempting 
targets in a crisis than the 10warhead mx and similar soviet 
missiles 
house and senate conferees will meet after the august recess to 
craft a final defense bill which also includes 10 billion for the 
department of energy for a 305 billion package 
the senate is expected to complete its version of a military 
authorization bill next week all money authorized still must be 
provided in separate appropriations bills 
the houses military spending blueprint suspends production of 
the b2 stealth bomber priced at about 530 million a copy until 
the pentagon scales back its 70 billion 132plane program 
the bill also requires the administration to show the b2 is a 
proven plane before production resumes 
bush and cheney had lobbied hard for the costly aircraft in the 
days before house action on the authorization bill the 
administration also pleaded its case for star wars 
but the house slashed 18 billion from the presidents request 
of 49 billion for star wars officially known as the strategic 
defense initiative earmarking the savings for conventional 
weapons cleanup of nuclear defense facilities and military drug 
interdiction 
bowing to widespread political support for the programs rep 
william dickinson rala pulled two measures to the house defense 
bill that would have eliminated money that was authorized by the 
house armed services committee and scuttle the f14d and the v22 
there was no need to ask the guys to walk the plank out of 
support of the administration dickinson said of his decision to 
withdraw the amendment to eliminate the marine corps v22 the 
tiltrotor assault transport that takes off like a helicopter but 
can fly like a plane 
the aircraft had the strong support of members from pennsylvania 
and texas where the osprey is built as well as former marines in 
congress 
the alabama republican said his gop colleagues from new york 
pressed him to withdraw the f14d amendment and an unofficial count 
made the outcome obvious when he announced the withdrawal there 
was scattered applause on the house floor 
the eventual fate of the f14d will not be decided until the 
house and senate meet in conference on their versions of the 
defense bill 
earlier this month the senate armed services committee accepted 
the bush administrations proposal to eliminate the program 
the house armed services committee however rejected the 
administrations plan to halt production of new f14ds and 
authorized 1 billion for the program in its military blueprint for 
the fiscal year starting oct 1 
defense secretary dick cheney in slashing 10 billion from the 
defense budget had proposed eliminated the program he contended 
other jet fighters would suffice 
earlier in the day the house approved a nonbinding resolution 
calling on bush to begin negotiations with the soviet union on a 
ban of production of plutonium and enriched uranium materials used 
in nuclear weapons 
the house approved the amendment 284138 the united states 
currently has no operating nuclear enrichment production plants 
while the soviets have between 12 and 14 
in other action the house 
approved an amendment limiting total outlays for defense in 
fiscal 1990 to 2992 billion 
approved an amendment sponsored by rep bill richardson 
dnm prohibiting the los alamos national laboratory from burning 
radioactive wastes until new mexico issues regulations on such 
incineration 
adopted a nonbinding resolution urging bush to press the 
soviets on dismantling their groundbased antisatellite weapons 
and to negotiate a treay with the soviets on imposing strict 
limitations on asat weapons 
voted to prohibit use of fiscal 1990 funds for army production 
of binary chemical weapons 
extended through fiscal 1993 the goal of having 5 percent of 
pentagon contracts awared to small and disadvantaged businesses 
adopted a nonbinding resolution urging bush to step up 
negotations with the soviets on an agreement to stop production and 
stockpiling of lethal chemical weapons

congressional negotiators reached agreement on 
a savings and loan bailout bill thursday night and the 
democraticcontrolled house completed major surgery on president 
bushs plans for star wars and new missiles as lawmakers rushed to 
wrap up their work for the summer 
a house committee also sent an flag protection bill to the floor 
for a vote and a senate panel postponed a decision on william 
lucas controversial nomination to head the justice department 
civil rights division 
both houses met late trying to make their unofficial aug 4 
adjournment date 
vice president quayle arrived at the capitol during the evening 
and watched from the presiding officers chair as the senate 
narrowly rejected a 1 billion cut in the administrations star 
wars program 
the vote in the house was 261162 to approve a 295 billion 
defense blueprint that differed dramatically from the one bush 
submitted 
the measure curtails production of the socalled stealth bomber 
cuts 18 billion from the administrations request for star wars 
and strips out all 100 million the administration sought for the 
midgetman missile 
two planes that president bush planned to scrap the navys 
f14d tomcat jet fighter and the marine corps v22 osprey vertical 
takeoff assault transport survived in the house as lawmakers 
bowed to widespread political support for the programs 
we got a michael dukakis defense bill rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee said 
referring to last falls defeated democratic presidential 
candidate mike won the election no midgetman no rail mx 
big cuts in sdi and slow up the b2 bomber 
the final obstacle in the way of the sampl bailout agreement was 
cleared when negotiators decided the multibilliondollar cost of 
the effort should be included in calculations of thje budget 
deficit 
but the bush administration raised an immediate objection and 
some senators cautioned the agreement could be rejected when it 
reaches the full senate next week 
the bill provides 166 billion over 10 years to close and rescue 
hundreds of failed savings institutions and provide sweeping 
reforms requiring sampl owners to risk more of their own money and 
concentrate on home lending 
in the senate meanwhile lawmakers approved the first 
construction funds for the super collider atom smasher in texas a 
44 billion project that scientists hope will unravel natures 
secrets the money was contained in a 184 billion money for 
energy and water projects for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
that bill adopted by voice vote was the second appropriations 
measure to clear the senate during the day the other provided 
443 billion for farm programs including 188 billion for 
domestic food assistance programs such as child nutrition programs 
wic and food stamps 
lawmakers also wrangled over how best to protect the american 
flag in the wake of a supreme court decision affording first 
amendment protection to desecration of old glory republicans want 
a constitutional amendment but majority democrats dont 
the panel voted 286 for a statute that says whoever 
knowingly mutilates defaces burns or tramples upon any flag of 
the united states shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for 
not more than one year or both 
all but one of the 13 republicans voting supported the bill as 
a symbolic gesture for the flag one said but the republican 
leadership blocked the democrats plan to bring the bill before the 
full house next week 
lucas denied a new unverified charge about his commitment to 
civil rights as the senate judiciary committee postponed a vote on 
his controversial nomination to a key justice department post 
sen howell heflin dala who holds a pivotal vote requested 
the committee delay its decison so he could look into unidentified 
lastminute information i dont want to injure anybody the 
allegations are not substantiated he emphasized 
congressional sources circulated a letter from attorney michael 
sussman of yonkers ny saying lucas had telephoned the justice 
department to urge it to drop a 1980 lawsuit against the city of 
birmingham mich charging fair housing act violations 
david runkel a spokesman for attorney general dick thornburgh 
issued a denial from lucas and described the allegation as 
reprehensible and a lastminute tactic designed to kill the 
nomination 
the senate also voted 5840 against delaying the new medicare 
surtax on the elderly designed to pay for much of the catastrophic 
care program for senior citizens but the plan is widely unpopular 
and another attempt to kill it is expected later this year 
many elderly people have complained that the surtax which would 
cost as much as 800 for the most welltodo among them is too 
expensive 
in other developments in congress thursday 
several lawmakers introduced legislation that would require 
nutritional labeling on all processed food sold in this country 
for far too long we americans have been shopping in the 
dark said sen howard metzenbaum dohio one of the lawmakers 
advocating a proposed nutrition labeling and education act 
senators said that a national service bill blending several 
democratic proposals should be on its way to the floor next week

a plan to print the friendship state on 
texas license plates has stirred up gubernatorial candidates who 
say texans are too tough for such a slogan 
its wimpy said democratic state treasurer ann richards 
the first of the gubernatorial hopefuls to join the chorus of 
opponents to the slogan approved last week by the state highway and 
public transportation commission 
friendship is too generic a term for texas where the tough 
dont mess with texas antilittering slogan has proven so 
popular ms richards said 
i think the reason the dont mess with texas thing has been 
so successful is that it sort of continues that image that were 
great were wonderful we think we are she said the friendly 
state you could put that on kansas ohio

the nations skies became more polluted in 
1988 with up to 30 million more americans now living in 
communities with unhealthy air the environmental protection agency 
said today 
new epa data shows that 101 geographical areas now violate 
standards for ozone the chief ingredient of smog and 44 have 
unhealthy carbon monoxide levels 
in addition to identifying polluted areas under current law the 
data has major implications for the future if congress approves new 
clean air legislation this session 
any new law would be expected to use the information to 
establish new deadlines for pollution cleanup and could determine 
the severity of measures each area must adopt in order to make 
steady progress

the antarctic ozone hole apparently caused 
record low ozone levels over southern australia in 1987 said 
scientists who suggested that the hole may raise skin cancer risk 
in the globes southern latitudes 
the work is the first detailed study that links the antarctic 
hole to observed ozone declines in the southern hemispheres 
midlatitudes where many people live scientists said 
the study concludes that record low ozone levels over southern 
australia and new zealand were caused mainly by the arrival of 
ozonepoor air from the antarctic hole 
southern south america and the southern tip of africa also may 
be vulnerable said study coauthor r alan plumb

catch a frenchman in an unguarded moment on a 
park bench at his desk staring out the window or waiting for a 
bus and likely as not hell be thinking about food 
food the creation of dishes the art of cooking the physical 
pleasure of eating and the ritual that surrounds it are perhaps the 
most important elements of french culture 
one of the years highlights is the annual publication of the 
michelin red guide which awards one to three stars to restaurants 
especially deserving of gustatory attention the 19 threestar 
eateries in france are objects of veneration for many 
top chefs critics and food historians agree that frances 
excellence in the culinary art is largely due to geographical 
accident 
all of the agriculture of temperate countries is represented 
here says bernard naegellen director of the michelin red guide 
and i think its that the great variety of agricultural 
products meat game that has given the french the habit of 
eating well 
emile jung the strasbourg chef whose restaurant le crocodile is 
the latest to achieve threestardom also attributes quality to 
frances geographic situation and stresses local produce 
look at the variety of meats butchers here can furnish the 
variety of fish he says we have virtually everything in 
france each province has its own gastronomic history and 
specialty this diversity makes for variations in cooking in the 
way foods taste 
in the 14th and 15th centuries french diners were less 
interested in the quality of the meal as in the abundance a feast 
usually meant tables running over with meat fish and fowl but 
little else 
printed cookbooks came out in the 17th century with the works of 
francois de la varenne and nicholas de bonnefons in the 18th 
century during the reigns of louis xiv and louis xv the craft of 
cooking became more refined and quality supplanted quantity 
the average frenchmen enjoyed little of this haute cuisine was 
a matter for the noble houses it was not until the revolution in 
1789 when many aristocratic heads rolled and many firstclass 
cooks found themselves out of work that the restaurant became 
widespread opened by newly unemployed chefs for a different class 
of diner 
the notion of gastronomy or the devotion of large amounts of 
time and effort to the preparation and consumption of food gained 
a wider clientele in the 19th century it was then that 
marcantoine careme one of the giants of the kitchen codified the 
total of french culinary knowledge in 12 volumes much studied by 
posterity 
frances worldwide reputation is in fact a fairly recent affair 
mainly since world war i 
of course there was escoffier who went to london at the end of 
the last century said michelins naegellen referring to auguste 
escoffier the french chef who became well known in europe but 
french cooking began to be known abroad at the beginning of the 
20th century 
it is almost impossible however to define what french cooking 
really is that is because french cooking is very regional and 
diverse 
the local produce inspires ideas in the kitchen makes it 
possible to compose interesting cuisine says threestar chef 
jung of strasbourg in the history of each province the nobility 
marshaled the resources of the countryside this availability of 
food gave ideas to the people living there there is a heritage of 
food of taste that is unique to france 
i think the genius of french cooking resides in the wine 
jung adds simmered dishes are nearly all based on the use of 
wine boeuf bourguignon coq au vin 
theres also fearless experimentation imagine the first person 
to ever consider popping a slippery snail into his mouth for a 
grisly chew with or without butter and garlic or testing the 
culinary possibilities of the humble frog 
the problem for great chefs today is finding products with 
taste says naegellen fresh food is not a problem all food 
today is fresh but to find food with taste 
any good chef will tell you that selection of the products is 
every bit as important if not more so than the preparation 
what is disappearing now are the restaurants of medium 
quality says naegellen twenty years ago there were 
restaurants that didnt change their menus much but made good 
things every day to please their customers all year they made the 
same thing and for a reasonable price now they all want to make 
money 
even so when a frenchman complains of having been served a poor 
meal many a foreigner might ask compared to what

anna and bob were bright capable wellmeaning 
and working to keep a marriage but there was a problem she was a 
woman and he was a man 
that means they had to contend with basic and often overlooked 
differences in the way women and men tend to think and behave it 
drove them into therapy 
researchers and therapists have been taking a closer look at 
what they say are common differences between the genders unless 
those disparities are heeded and accounted for they say the 
result can be trouble for a marriage 
i think everybody has known that there are some basic gender 
differences in marriage but scientific study began only 
recently said marital researcher howard markman of the university 
of denver 
these are patterns that are very strong that most people 
simply arent aware of said froma walsh an associate professor 
of social work and psychiatry at the university of chicago 
common genderrelated differences include how readily feelings 
are expressed how intimacy is sought and how conflicts are 
negotiated markman and walsh said in a marriage the patterns can 
make arguments erupt out of nowhere and sabotage attempts to 
resolve conflicts 
take anna and bob they often fought with unsatisfying results 
anna blamed bob for trying to control her and blamed herself for 
consistently giving in bob considered anna wishywashy 
walsh said that as she counseled them it became clear that bob 
argued to win in contrast anna said i really go in wanting to 
please him and wanting his approval 
walsh told the couple it looks like you have different 
rules 
as soon as they realized that it got them out of blaming each 
other walsh said in an interview no wonder things always turn 
out his way 
the couple reflects a typical pattern in marriages walsh said 
men learn from society to be powerful in their arguments and to win 
as much as they can women learn to take more interest in gaining 
love and approval which prods them toward accommodation in 
conflicts 
markman said men commonly focus on the outcome of the 
discussion while women often care more about the process such as 
wanting to express feelings before moving to solutions 
another pattern therapists and researchers see is that while 
wives are more likely than husbands to bring up domestic matters 
for discussion men typically try to withdraw from conflict with 
their wives 
men do not always realize they are withdrawing markman said 
sometimes they say they do not even hear their wives 
the question of why men tend to withdraw is controversial 
markman said 
walsh attributes it to mens discomfort with intimate 
discussions and communication of feelings a result of a working 
world that emphasizes competitiveness and hiding ones 
vulnerabilities 
markman suggests another explanation as boys husbands may have 
learned to resolve conflicts through explicit rules and umpires in 
their sports while their adult marriages typically offer little 
such structure 
another factor several researchers have suggested is biology 
the idea is that conflict between spouses may be physically harder 
on husbands because it pushes them into an uncomfortable state of 
physical arousal including faster heart beat and a flow of 
adrenaline 
once aroused men may also take longer to return to normal said 
marital researcher john gottman of the university of washington 
one study found that husbands showed higher skin conductance a 
measure of physical arousal when listening to their wives 
complain than women did as husbands complained 
gottman cautioned that such differences may actually stem from 
cultural factors rather than biology 
whatever the reason the husbands withdrawal spurs the wife to 
press the issue which triggers further withdrawal further 
pressing and so on walsh said 
markman and colleague shelley kraft see a withdrawalandpursuit 
pattern behind negative escalation cycles which are 
essentially the way arguments grow out of small things and get 
hotter and hotter 
the cycles are characteristic of unhappy marriages while 
couples in happy marriages generally know how to avoid them 
markman said 
a cycle may begin when a wife approaches her husband who is 
reading a newspaper 
we really need to talk judy says harry doesnt answer 
harry i said we really need to talk she says more 
emphatically 
oh harry says innocently looking up were you talking to 
me 
you never listen to me you never want to talk 
that is not true i love to talk but we never talk we just 
fight 
there you go again changing the subject on me i really cant 
stand this much longer 
harry switches his glare back to the newspaper judy goes to 
tend the children in another room 
what happened here 
in the researchers view judy asking to talk was an attempt to 
establish some intimacy perhaps she sounded negative because she 
was tired and anxious as she recalled harrys rejections of 
intimate discussions 
harry thought juday had another gripe and thinking that such 
discussions never go anywhere except to an emotional eruption he 
decided to try to avoid her when that didnt work he played dumb 
his tactics made judy more negative and the cycle was off and 
running his mistaken expectation that she wanted an argument 
became selffulfilling 
the exchange also illustrates another gender difference markman 
and kraft see in how each experiences intimacy women the 
researchers suggest place great stock in facetoface talk about 
feelings just the kind from which men may withdraw males may 
prefer to find intimacy in shared activities 
the result can be misunderstanding markman and kraft cited the 
case of one man who said he felt close to his wife when they 
watched television together the wife however complained that all 
he wanted to do was watch television and that he didnt want to 
talk to her 
recognizing and countering genderbased patterns may help ease 
the distress they provoke in marriages much of good couples 
therapy is helping the partners become more aware of hidden 
patterns which lets them break such cycles and negotiate more 
satisfying rules walsh said 
to provide men with structure for handling conflict markman 
said a premarital relationship enhancement program is 
available in many places around the country to teach ground rules 
for arguing couples who go through the training before marrying 
show happier marriages and only half the divorces that other 
couples do he said 
theres a bumpy road through marriage but it can be ridden 
markman said weve kind of mapped out scientifically at least 
the terrain of marital difficulties and now weve provided some 
roadmaps

the hubble space telescope to be launched next year 
is the flagship of an orbiting armada that will explore the flash 
from the creation of the universe and send back news that could 
change mankinds view of the cosmos 
it will also search for signs of extraterrestrial even 
intelligent life 
it is rare that how we think of the universe changes in a 
single lifetime but thats whats about to happen said dr 
charles j pellerin jr director of the astrophysics division at 
nasa headquarters in washington 
in the next two years the united states will launch six 
astronomical observers to explore different sections of the 
electromagnetic spectrum from gamma to radio data will be 
analyzed by teams of scientists around the globe 
there will be whole sets of new things well see out there and 
be dazzled by pellerin said during the paris air show adding 
that the hubble will answer many longstanding astrophysical 
questions and raise new ones 
in november nasa will launch the cosmic background explorer 
cobe to look further back in intergalactic time than humanity ever 
has using six different instruments cobe will measure background 
light rather than points like stars 
many astronomers believe the universe started from one timeless 
point a darkness transformed by a big bang into an expanding 
sphere of energy and matter that spread to occupy the emptiness of 
space 
cobe will measure the flash at the background of the creation 
of the universe the residual flash of the big bang pellerin 
said we will be trying to understand whether the universe is 
still expanding something for consideration by scientists and 
perhaps theologians 
in february the rosat mission a cooperative venture with west 
germany will be launched to conduct a detailed survey of xrays 
emitted in the universe by violent explosions such as those 
occurring at the end of a stars life 
the hubble is to be carried into orbit in march by space shuttle 
discovery and a month later a group of instruments called astro 
will be launched to measure ultraviolet rays and study supernovas 
by the end of 1990 a gamma ray observatory will be launched and 
finally in 1991 an ultraviolet explorer will begin to study 
quasars the mysterious starlike points of light that emit more 
energy than major galaxies 
the a fullscale cutaway mockup of the hubble was the 
centerpiece of the national aeronautics and space administrations 
exhibit at the paris air show in june at 43 feet long 14 feet in 
diameter and weighing 25500 pounds it not only is the largest 
telescope ever built but also the most precise 
drawings make the hubble look like a giant eye floating above 
the earth attached to two wings large solar panels that will 
unfurl in space and supply the telescope with a minimum of 2400 
watts of power 
in addition to a telescope hubble will contain five 
instruments a widefield planetary camera a faintobject 
spectrograph a highresolution spectrograph a highspeed 
photometer and a faintobject camera 
data will be transmitted to earth and reconstructed for study by 
a select group of scientists that will change each year 
the hubble orbiting 373 miles above earth and outside the 
atmosphere will produce images of unprecedented clarity looking 
out through earths atmosphere is like looking up from the bottom 
of a pond at a light astronomers say 
they can use the telescope to examine the clouds of venus the 
deep valleys of mars and make other planetary observations that 
will be useful in studying the possibilities for exploiting 
resources throughout the solar system 
queen isabella sent out an armada of ships to explore the 
world and nothing was ever the same again pellerin said 
america is sending out a similar armada leading the exploration 
of the universe 
we are about to be amazed

environmentalists struggling to save 
endangered green and loggerhead turtles have turned a sandy strip 
on cyprus western coast into a conservation zone protected from 
the annual invasion of a million tourists 
volunteers from greece england italy the united states 
cyprus and other countries patrol the beach during the hatching 
season from june through august when most tourists arrive said 
andreas demetropoulos director of the governments fisheries 
department and a driving force behind the project 
up to 4000 young turtles are hatched and released into the 
mediterranean every year thanks to the project that was started 11 
years ago at one of the turtles main breeding grounds 
demetropoulos said but he noted whats the good if we put 4000 
turtles into the sea while other countries catch them 
the lara team and environmental specialists from 12 
mediterranean nations met in nicosia in early july to work out a 
campaign to protect the species 
they focused on the need to ban fishing and tourism during the 
spawning season reduce or ban construction of hotels bars and 
other attractions near breeding grounds and outlaw the sale of 
turtle flesh or shells 
the plan will be presented to the barcelona convention for the 
protection of the mediterranean sea at its next session in greece 
in october 
during the early days of the conservation project there was an 
estimated population of about 100 green turtles said myroula 
hadjichristoforou one of the projects directors the loggerhead 
population was around 200 
the current number is not known but the team believes it is 
doing much to build up the species although it will take years 
before they can confirm it 
the unborn turtles face many hazards such as tourists 
trampling over the unmarked nests or wild animals who dig up the 
eggs and eat them said demetropoulos who is also chairman of 
the cyprus wildlife society 
the female turtles lay eggs every two or three years heading 
instinctively for the nighttime phosphorescence from waves they 
crawl out of the sea dig holes 1 to 3 feet deep and bury the 
eggs they lay as many as 100 eggs at a time every two weeks during 
the season the eggs take about eight weeks to hatch the 
thumbsized babies emerge at night and make for the surf 
environmentalists say that if tourist facilities are allowed on 
the breeding beaches the baby turtles can be lured by the lights 
from hotels or camp fires go the wrong way and perish 
crows hawks and foxes that prowl most beaches during the 
breeding season add to the hazards the hatchlings face even before 
they are born the lara volunteers cover known nests with wire mesh 
to keep out the foxes 
the project also keeps about 100 turtles ranging from 1 to 9 
years old in sea cages in the harbor at paphos so they can grow 
before they are released giving them a better chance of survival 
from sea predators 
cyprus plans to hold a training course this year for 
environmentalists from mediterranean countries to widen the efforts 
to save the turtles 
already the turkish government has allocated beaches in the 
dalyan iztuzu area on the agaean coast as a protected nesting area 
for loggerhead turtles it also has promised to establish a reserve 
for green turtles near the mediterranean port of antalya 
in greece environmentalists launched a similar protection 
project two years ago at laganas bay in the western resort island 
of zakinthos laganas is a major loggerhead nesting area in the 
mediterranean

laughter may not be the best medicine 
but putting on a smile can have a moodmellowing effect thats more 
than skin deep 
changes in the muscles of the face can indirectly raise or lower 
the temperature of the blood to the brain affecting the release of 
moodaltering chemicals said university of michigan psychologist 
robert zajonc 
the muscle changes alter the temperature of blood in the 
cavernous sinus a vein that wraps around a nasal artery carrying 
blood to the brain said zajonc whose research was published in 
the july issue of psychological review 
i do not claim that temperature change is the only way of 
inducing emotional state but the theory helps explain a number of 
curious phenomena for example it might explain why placebo pills 
are so frequently effective 
people who take placebos may momentarily change their breathing 
patterns and facial expressions indirectly changing the 
temperature in regions of the brain that release painreducing 
chemicals called endorphins he said 
in experiments on facial movement unrelated to emotions zajonc 
asked 26 people to pronounce and comment on vowel sounds the 
subjects preferred ah and ee sounds which prompted a 
decrease in temperature 
the theory that facial expressions may influence emotions first 
was raised in 1907 by french physician israel waynbaum who 
believed that the muscles pressure on arteries partly controlled 
how much blood reached the brain

dont expect to see a salesman in a 
plaid polyester spacesuit but travelers moon will find three 
lowmileage singleowner used cars when they get to the moon they 
may need a jumpstart however 
the 10 million buggies used by astronauts to explore the moon 
were left behind after the apollo 15 16 and 17 missions in 1971 
and 1972 
its been almost 20 years so we would probably expect the 
batteries to have run down but otherwise they might be in pretty 
good shape said gene cowart chief engineer on the national 
aeronautics and space administrations 40 million lunar roving 
vehicle project in the late 1960s 
after president bushs recent call for renewed space 
exploration cowart a boeing co engineer began thinking about 
the usefulness of what nasa has left on the moon basically its 
just the vehicles a few cameras and the bottom half of lunar 
excursion modules left behind when the astronauts blasted back off 
to rendezvous with their command shop and come home 
with the aluminumframe rovers astronauts who might otherwise 
have been limited to exploring within a halfmile of their lems 
could roam miles across the lunar surface the three vehicles that 
were used were designed to go up to 50 miles on their initial 
batteries but none went farther than 22 miles

chronic users of an illicit drug dubbed 
ecstasy showed a spinal fluid abnormality in a new study that 
suggests the drug may damage brain cells 
the work follows ample evidence that ecstasy causes 
longterm brain cell damage in rats and monkeys said researcher 
george ricaurte but it is too preliminary to prove whether the 
drug causes such damage in humans he said 
ricaurte of the johns hopkins school of medicine in baltimore 
presented the study recently at a meeting sponsored by the new york 
academy of sciences 
ecstasy is formally known as mdma or 
34methylenedioxymethamphetamine users report a variety of 
pleasurable reactions such as losing defensive anxiety and feeling 
more open emotionally 
in rats and monkeys mdma damages nerve cell fibers that contain 
serotonin a substance some brain cells use to communicate 
ricaurte presented a study of squirrel monkeys in which mdma 
treatment destroyed 90 percent of serotonincontaining nerve fibers 
in the forebrain the monkeys also showed abnormally low levels in 
the spinal fluid of a substance that is a breakdown product of 
serotonin 
so ricaurte studied the spinal fluid from 34 longtime human 
users of mdma to look for abnormally low levels of the breakdown 
product called 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid or 5hiaa 
the users had taken mdma for an average of about five years 
twice a month on average they had not taken any within two weeks 
of the spinal fluid test 
on average the users showed about 25 percent less 5hiaa in 
their spinal fluid than was found in a group of 24 nonusers 
studied for comparison 
ricaurte cautioned that the study did not account for several 
factors that can affect 5hiaa levels in the spinal fluid such as 
diet and activity 
without that precaution he said it would be premature to draw 
any conclusions about mdmas longterm effect in humans current 
studies are accounting for factors that affect 5hiaa 
concentrations he said 
he also said he and colleagues have just begun to look for 
longterm changes in behavior or thinking due to mdma and have not 
identified any it may take detailed testing to uncover any effect 
he said

opec nations supplied more crude to the 
world market in june than permitted under a production agreement 
designed to boost oil prices the organization said 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries said 12 of its 
13 member nations sold 1787 million barrels a day of oil last 
month which was 362000 barrels above the ceiling in place at the 
time 
the cartel said in a statement wednesday carried by its news 
agency opecna that june figures were not available for the united 
arab emirates 
the emirates a persistent cheater on production accords had a 
supply quota of 988000 barrels a day last month it was raised in 
the new agreement to 1 million barrels 
a new accord went into effect july 1 lifting the production cap 
for all 13 nations to 195 million barrels a day in the last half 
of the year it had been 185 million barrels in the january to 
june period 
bryan jacoboski an analyst at paine webber inc in new york 
estimated opec production in july was running close to 21 million 
barrels a day 
he said the united arab emirates and kuwait were producing more 
than their share and that saudi arabia the worlds no 1 crude 
exporter was a bit above its supply cap 
the new output accord fashioned at a june meeting of oil 
ministers was designed to keep a firm grip on production so that 
prices would remain robust it left the target price at 18 a 
barrel 
but prices began tumbling last week partly reflecting a 
weakness in demand for gasoline 
other factors including the ending of the coal strike in the 
soviet union have also contributed to the decline analysts say 
the resolution of the miners walkout eased fears the unrest could 
spread to the oil sector 
on the new york mercantile exchange the september futures 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark american crude 
was trading at 1830 a barrel oil prices had been in the 
20range just over a week ago 
oil supplied by the opec nations is generally priced several 
dollars below the american brand 
to meet the julydecember ceiling some opec nations would have 
to slash their production analysts estimated output had picked up 
in early june to about 21 million barrels a day 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that opec production in june was 213 million barrels 
a day the highest level so far this year the report was released 
in early july 
the energy agency which is part of the western nations 
organization of economic cooperation and development predicted 
demand for opec oil would be about 209 million barrels a day in 
the second half of the year

families with working mothers are spending 14 
billion a year on child care an expense that costs women in 
poverty more than onefifth of their income the census bureau says 
of the 58 million women who reported making regular payments 
for child care the average weekly cost was 4520 the bureau said 
wednesday that amounted to about 6 percent of their income in 1986 
when the study was conducted 
while women living in poverty reported spending 32 a week for 
child care that amounted to 22 percent of their incomes according 
to the report 
women with incomes over 3750 a month paid 58 a week for care 
4 percent of their income 
the bureaus figures are to be published later this year as part 
of a detailed analysis of child care arrangements across the 
country preliminary material was released wednesday for use by 
congressional subcommittees debating legislation aimed at helping 
families which need child care 
testimony presented to congress has estimated child care costs 
as ranging from about 2500 annually to 6000 in large cities 
the 4520 weekly average calculated in the study would amount to 
2305 per year 
overall the census bureau found there were 20 million children 
between 5 and 14 and another 9 million under age 5 with working 
mothers 
of the younger group the largest share 41 percent received 
care in someone elses home 23 percent by a nonrelative 11 
percent by a grandparent and the rest by another relative 
in addition nearly 30 percent were cared for at their own home 
by someone who came in there were 15 percent in day care centers 
6 percent in nursery school 1 percent in kindergarten and about 7 
percent cared for by the mother at work 
for the group aged 5 to 14 nearly 70 percent attended school 
while mother worked about 14 percent were cared for by someone who 
came to their home 5 percent went to someone elses home 5 
percent were taking care of themselves 3 percent went to work with 
mother and the rest had other group care arrangements 
while the care arrangements for the under5 group was relatively 
consistent all year for the 5to14 children things were a lot 
different in summer when school was out 
in summer the 70 percent attending school dropped to 22 percent 
those cared for at their own home went up to 33 percent those in 
someone elses home rose to 17 percent and children caring for 
themselves jumped to 13 percent nearly 9 percent went to work with

digital audio tape may be the next generation of 
music technology but some observers say it could take awhile to 
catch on in the united states in spite of the removal of a 
political obstacle 
a yettobeannounced agreement cleared the way for widespread 
us sales of dat players by requiring that the devices to contain 
a chip that limits copying of digital tapes record companies 
insisted on the copy protection for fear that widespread copying 
would cut into their sales of compact discs 
it is expected to take several months for the manufacturers to 
add the copyprotection circuitry to the machines and bring the 
devices to market 
sales may be slow at first recorder prices start at about 
1000 while blank tapes which are about half the size of 
conventional cassettes go for 12 to 18 and prerecorded tapes 
are priced at 24 to 30 
moreover prerecorded dat cassettes are scarce because there is 
a small market for them that in turn is limiting sales of the 
equipment in japan and europe where they have been on the market 
for several years 
the sound quality of dat is excellent with none of the hiss of 
ordinary tape dat also seems to produce a deeper sound than 
compact discs as if sound was coming out of a second pair of 
speakers behind the first one 
digital audio tape records sound in the form of the ones and 
zeroes of computer language in contrast to conventional tape in 
which sound is recorded as an analog version of actual sound 
waves 
the copyprotection system called solo was developed by nv 
philips the dutch electronics giant said albert ruttner a vice 
president of north american philips corp philips us arm 
with the copyprotection chip a dat player can make a nearly 
perfect digital recording from a digital source such as a cd but 
it is impossible to make copies of the copy that means people 
would be able to make copies of cds for their own use but would not 
be able to start up a massive piracy operation of highspeed 
tapetotape copying 
the recording industry association of america said wednesday it 
would provide a statement for reporters on the deal today but would 
not allow it to be made public before friday 
the philipsdeveloped solo chip leaves an inaudible electronic 
flag on a dat cassette a recorder that detects the flag will 
not copy the cassette 
philips has been saying the solo system does not affect the 
quality of the music in any way unlike a system proposed by cbs 
records that was criticized by testers from the governments 
national engineering laboratory 
still the controversy over copy protection which has delayed 
the official us introduction of dat for more than a year could 
cause some potential customers to feel that dat players with the 
solo chip are somehow inferior 
if just one person in a magazine says theres an audible 
difference people will say im not going to buy it i dont know 
how much of it is psychosomatic said kevin mcevoy director of 
national sales for 6th avenue electronics city inc in new york 
which sells dat machines acquired in japan through unofficial 
channels 
represented in the working group that reached the 
copyprotection agreement are 15 japanese and european 
manufacturers the washingtonbased electronic industries 
association and two recording industry trade groups the recording 
industry association of america and the londonbased international 
federation of phonographic industries according to ron petty a 
sony corp of america spokesman in park ridge nj 
dat machines are being sold in japan and some parts of europe 
and in limited quantities in the united states most of the models 
sold in the united states are not through manufacturerauthorized 
channels and therefore do not carry warranties the sales however 
are legal 
professional dat equipment also is available in the united 
states from several foreign manufacturers 
most of the dat equipment now on the market cannot make direct 
digital recordings from cds without modification they first must 
convert the digital signals into the analog mode and then reconvert 
them to digital some listeners say that results in a slight 
degradation of sound quality although others say the change is 
unnoticeable 
japanese electronics makers which manufacture most dat 
equipment have refrained from actively selling dat machines in the 
united states because of opposition from the us record industry 
and the threat of copyrightinfringement lawsuits

international business machines corp has 
confirmed it has postponed the announcement of a new family of 
datastorage devices because some of its test results had not met 
expectations 
the devices are intended to replace the 3380 family of disk 
drives that were announced in 1980 and account for roughly 5 
billion a year in sales for ibm 
ibms stock price fell 150 after the wall street journal 
reported the delay in wednesdays editions but ended the day only 
25 cents lower at 11250 in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading 
ibm had been scheduled to hold a news conference tuesday to 
announce the new generation of disk drives which store massive 
quantities of information for big mainframe computers 
when we are satisfied that this product performs to our 
exacting standards we will announce it the company said in a 
brief statement monday 
analysts said the delay would probably be at least several 
months or the company would have gone ahead with the announcement 
ibm was embarrassed when it announced the 3380 family in 1980 and 
then could not begin deliveries until late 1981 
were telling customers to be prepared for fall deliveries but 
dont bet the farm on it said frank gens an analyst at 
international data corp in framingham mass 
ibms japanese competitors will have a hard time exploiting the 
delay because they do not have disk drives that match what ibm will 
be bringing out said robert bardagy executive vice president of 
comdisco inc which leases ibm equipment 
separately ibm said it had agreed to spend 1165 million to 
acquire a 198 percent stake in policy management systems corp a 
company in columbia sc that makes software for insurance 
companies 
it said it would be permitted to buy an additional 102 percent 
in the open market 
the investment is the latest in a spree of investments in 
software companies by ibm analysts say the company is trying to 
get the companies to write more software for ibm computers 
in another development the city of baltimore gave ibm 
permission to build a 26story 50 million office building in the 
desirable inner harbor section in exchange for ibm concessions 
including a payment to the city of 700000

just nine days after the founding family of 
cummins engine co spent about 72 million of its own money to 
insulate the indiana diesel engine maker from possible takeover 
another challenge may be on the horizon 
industrial equity pacific ltd a hong kongbased investment 
concern has acquired 99 percent of cummins according to a filing 
wednesday with the securities and exchange commission 
on july 17 members of the miller family which founded cummins 
in 1919 paid a premium to buy back 88 percent of cummins stock 
held by the us arm of british conglomerate hanson plc 
industrial equity said it acquired its cummins stake for 
investment purposes and did not plan to launch a takeover 
robert g sutherland a director of industrial equity and chief 
executive of its north american operations said the company began 
buying cummins stock about a year ago 
we started before hanson he said in a telephone interview 
from his office in la jolla calif we were equally surprised to 
learn of hansons stake which was disclosed in december 
miller family members were not immediately reachable wednesday 
for comment on the iep stock acquisition 
henry b schacht chairman and chief executive of columbus 
indbased cummins said sutherland notified cummins management of 
its stake thursday night 
these people are much much smaller than hanson schacht 
said after talking to sutherland these are not people who have 
spent 25 years acquiring and restructuring companies 
schacht said the news of the industrial equity interest would 
not generate the concern that had been caused by hansons stake 
it would be very different to our constituents he said 
however wall street reacted positively to the news bidding up 
the price of cummins stock wednesday by 250 to close at 6025 a 
share in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
j irwin miller cummins 80yearold former chairman and other 
family members said last week that they were paying about 72 
million or about 5 million over the going price for hansons 
shares to allay fears cummins might be bought and moved 
the payment of a premium price to reacquire a companys shares 
from an outside investor who may or may not launch a takeover 
attempt is often called greenmail 
columbus a city of 32000 people about 35 miles south of 
indianapolis is famous throughout the midwest for its outdoor 
sculpture and the distinctive modern architecture of its public 
buildings much of it paid for by cummins the towns major 
employer worldwide the company employs 26000 
iep a securities investment concern with holdings in several 
countries including the united states said it paid 602 million 
for the 101 million shares of cummins common stock it acquired by 
tuesday 
iep is 70 percent controlled by brierley investments ltd a 
wellington new zealand securities investment corporation through 
intermediary companies in britain hong kong and the cook islands 
in the pacific 
iep said it bought the cummins shares for investment but that it 
might acquire more shares up to 25 percent of the total either 
on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
according to the sec filing iep operates two wholly owned 
subsidiaries anadite inc a chicagobased foundry and forgings 
company and associated hosts inc a restaurant and hotel operator 
iep also holds the majority of shares in tozer kemsley amp

twelve states have sued visa and mastercard for 
allegedly conspiring to prevent other companies from introducing a 
national debit card network while delaying the launch of a debit 
card they developed jointly 
a debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card but 
the money is automatically transferred from the cardholders 
account to the merchants 
you dont have to be an expert in antitrust law its the most 
basic common sense to see what theyre up to new york attorney 
general robert abrams said wednesday after the civil antitrust suit 
was filed in us district court in manhattan 
you had separate entities available to compete with one 
another and over a course of several years as a result of a 
concerted strategy as a result of an implemented conspiracy they 
have now monopolized the market he said and they have done 
that in violation of state and federal antitrust laws 
visa usa inc and mastercard international inc both said the 
allegations were unfounded 
according to the complaint visa and mastercard allegedly 
undermined competition through a joint venture called entree and 
by acquiring control of the nations two largest automated teller 
machine networks 
the two atm networks cirrus system inc of downers grove 
ill and plus system inc of denver had been devising their own 
plans for national debit card networks in the early and mid 1980s 
the merger agreements required them to abandon those plans 
abrams said 
visa also took over the interlink network based in san mateo 
calif the nations largest regional debit card network 
abrams said 93 percent of retail transactions in america today 
are done by cash or check so the development of a debit card 
will have enormous implications of practical consequence to both 
consumers and merchants 
visa and mastercard signed an agreement in 1987 to jointly 
introduce entree more than 177 financial institutions have joined 
entree and 14 million entree cards have been issued abrams said 
but since no merchants accept the cards their only use is to 
withdraw cash from automated teller machines 
all of these entities are committed to the program but the 
program has not been introduced in any significant way to 
merchants said lloyd constantine chief of the antitrust bureau 
in abrams office if and when somebody tries to come in to the 
market this entity is ready to pounce 
abrams said the two companies apparently have chosen instead to 
continue to promote their highly profitable credit card business 
they want to continue to maintain the profits of their credit 
card operations by having dominance and control of the introduction 
of the debit card industry he said 
the suit asks the federal court to stop the entree joint 
venture compel the divestiture of cirrus by mastercard and plus 
and interlink by visa and impose fines of as much as 1 million 
each per violation of antitrust laws 
constantine said the fines could total as much as 10 million 
each on the new york charges alone 
visa issued a brief statement saying the allegations were 
unfounded and not in the best interest of the public 
what weve been attempting to do with entree is bring another 
valuable payment system option to consumers and merchants the 
statement said 
we continue to believe that entree is procompetition and that 
it can provide consumers a valuable service said visa spokesman 
dan brigham although he conceded that no merchants have yet been 
signed to participate in the program 
mastercard issued a statement saying the notion that 
mastercards participation in this novel and untried program is 
anticompetitive is completely unfounded on the contrary if the 
program should prove to be successful it will be highly 
procompetitive we are convinced that entree is perfectly 
lawful and in the public interest and we are confident that we 
will prevail in the courts 
both brigham and a spokesman for new yorkbased mastercard 
richard woods said it was the banks responsibility to recruit 
merchants for the card 
mastercard has really served as a catalyst in creating the 
system woods said at this point it is really a matter between 
the banks and merchants to provide an economic reason to present 
this program to the consumers our feeling is that there is a 
great interest out there in debit 
the other states that filed suit were california connecticut 
louisiana maryland massachusetts minnesota tennessee texas 
washington west virginia and wisconsin

a graduate student who officials say unleased 
a virus that infected thousands of military and university 
computers is the first person charged under a federal law banning 
unauthorized computer access 
robert tappan morris was indicted wednesday in syracuse ny 
on a single count of illegally gaining access to at least four 
computers and paralyzing their operations he is scheduled to be 
arraigned before a us magistrate aug 2 
the justice department said in a statement here that the case 
represents the first time that federal prosecutors have brought 
charges under a section of a 1986 law that prohibits unauthorized 
computer access 
the indictment followed months of deliberations within the 
justice department about whether to bring felony or misdemeanor 
charges against morris who was a student at cornell university 
when the incident occurred nov 2 
the charge carries a maximum fiveyear sentence and a fine of up 
to 250000 morris of arnold md could also be ordered to pay 
restitution to cover damages if he is convicted 
a computer industry group estimated that the virus infected 
6200 computers and caused 96 million in damages but a cornell 
university panel that investigated the incident called the estimate 
grossly exaggerated 
the indictment stated that the virus caused damage of more than 
1000 
defense lawyer thomas a guidoboni said morris would plead 
innocent 
the cornell panel said the virus or worm affected thousands of 
university and military computers hooked up to the nationwide 
arpanet network used to transmit nonclassified data the network

a general motors corp auto assembly 
plant made its last car and sent its 1300 workers home with 
little hope that the 41yearold plant would ever reopen 
weve done a lot of deep thinking about what were going to do 
with our lives said robert biscotti a plant supervisor there 
has been a grieving period but after awhile you realize what can 
you do 
gm closed the plant wednesday because demand for its buick 
century and oldsmobile cutlass ciera hasnt kept pace with its 
capacity to build them 
dee allen a spokesman for the automaker said at most the door 
is ajar 
we havent precluded the option of opening again but we have 
more than enough facilities without framingham he said from 
detroit 
the plant has had two other layoffs including about 1200 last 
spring and some temporary closings during the last several years 
about 500 workers are staying on temporarily to mothball the plant 
weve had good years where weve worked six days a week and 
then days where we dont work at all said roland cole a 20year 
plant veteran and united auto workers member 
its been a home to a lot of us weve been like brothers 
says joao decruz a portugal native who plans to go on unemployment 
compensation 
many of the senior employees have opted for early retirement 
some have taken advantage of gm state and federally funded 
retraining programs or relocation 
others have accepted a company buyout that union officials say 
they cant discourage because the prospects for getting rehired are 
poor gm offered onetime payments of 40000 to workers with 10 or 
more years service and 65000 to those with 25 years on the job 
gov michael dukakis who holds out hope for a resumption of 
production said there is not much that can be done if people 
arent buying cars 
dukakis recalled wednesday how he met with gm president roger 
smith and other top company officials about sparing the plant after 
the company announced the closing plans in february 
all i can tell you is what he said to me and that was that 
they didnt invest a quarter of a billion dollars to modernize the 
plant so gm could walk away from it dukakis said but he 
said it comes down to economics 
the plant was the largest employer last year in framingham 22 
miles southwest of boston it paid 830000 in local taxes spent 
19 million on local suppliers and had a payroll of 59 million 
the city of 65000 is likely to overcome the loss better than 
many factory towns because of its diverse economic base which 
includes computer manufacturing stationery production and a 
375room hotel

a partisan dispute over how to fund president 
bushs multibilliondollar savings and loan bailout is the last 
major snag holding up a housesenate compromise on the legislation 
congressional negotiators resolved virtually every other 
difference between the two chambers wednesday in a marathon session 
that began at 9 am and lasted nearly until midnight 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich the leader of the 
fivemember senate delegation and rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said they intended to finish work today 
the full house and senate would then be expected to vote on the 
compromise package next week before leaving on vacation sending it 
to bush six months after he first outlined his 10year 166 
billion proposal to close or rescue hundreds of failed sampls 
the chief sticking point keeping the bill from the presidents 
desk was a dispute over whether to count sampl spending as part of 
the budget deficit 
the bush administration and the senate want to keep 50 billion 
out of the deficit democrats and the house would balloon the 
deficit but prevent sampl spending from triggering automatic 
spending cuts under the grammrudman law 
earlier this week sens alan cranston dcalif jake garn 
rutah and sen john heinz rpa held a majority on the senate 
side insisting on the administration plan according to industry 
and congressional sources 
but house conferees on wednesday said privately they believed 
cranston could be persuaded to change his mind and join riegle and 
sen paul sarbanes dmd in support of conceding to the house 
however cranston told reporters during a break in negotiations 
that he has not changed his position if cranston did shift the 
democratic funding plan would still have to clear the senate where 
administration supporter sen phil gramm rtexas says he has the 
support of 40 other senators enough to block it under that 
chambers rules 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady has threatened to recommend 
the president veto the bill unless congress agrees to 
administrations offbudget mechanism but democrats say they are 
confident bush would not hold up badly needed legislation over a 
budget accounting question 
in compromises struck wednesday senate delegates at the urging 
of the house agreed to tougher limits on junk bonds as well as a 
requirement that sampls devote more assets to home mortgage lending 
in exchange the house made two concessions to the senate 
conferees decided to permit sampl regulator m danny wall to 
continue in his job for at least two years and they gave power over 
statechartered thrifts to the new agency that wall will head 
within the treasury department rather than to the independent 
federal deposit insurance corp 
those issues were important to sen jake garn of utah the 
senior republican on the senate banking committee wall earlier 
served as garns chief aide and the senator wanted to protect 
walls job and the power of his agency 
house and senate conferees also reached agreement on capital 
rules governing how much money sampl owners are required to invest in 
their institutions both house and senate would require sampl owners 
to back their lending with more of their own money and they settled 
a difference on the timing of the new standards 
in other deals struck the fdic got the job of disposing of real 
estate and other assets from failed sampls but it will be overseen 
by a fivemember oversight board the resolution trust corp 
headed by the treasury secretary 
nonprofit groups and poor people will get the first chance to 
buy residential properties controlled by the rtc also the 
industryowned regional federal home loan banks will subsidize 
housing loans for poor people and banks and sampls with more than 
30 million in assets will have to disclose their records of 
serving minorities and the poor

the nations nuclear power plants will have 
enough sites to store spent nuclear fuel until 2025 even if the 
government scraps the planned yucca mountain repository in nevada 
according to a nuclear regulatory commission task force report 
the commissions waste confidence review group in wednesdays 
report to commissioners said a new site could be selected and put 
into operation by then if necessary 
robert bernero who headed the task force said finding and 
opening a new site would take 25 years plans call for the yucca 
mountain repository to begin operations in 2003 initial 
construction work on shafts aimed at detailed investigation of the 
nevada site is scheduled to begin in november 
in 1987 congress suspended consideration of any site other than 
yucca mountain other sites that had been considered were the 
hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash and a site in 
deaf smith county texas 
the task force said yucca mountain mandated by the nuclear 
waste policy act amendment of 1987 could prove unsuitable 
the nevada governor opposes the project questions have arisen 
about geological faults and potential volcanic activity at the 
site and the nrc staff is concerned that environmental protection 
agency standards may be unworkable 
bernero director of nrc nuclear materials safety and 
safeguards said new drystorage technology means fuel can be 
stored longer more safely and more cheaply above ground as a 
result he said estimates of 30 years of safe onsite storage are 
conservative 
plants that once had operating licenses for 40 years may have 
them extended by as many as 30 years meaning that fuel may be on 
site 100 years before finding a final resting place bernero said 
the nrc reviews the waste confidence decision every five 
years the commission will vote on the present report and publish 
its findings for public comment

hollywood could lose big if it doesnt agree 
to a plan limiting the amount of us television shows such as 
dallas and the golden girls that can be shown in europe 
british media executive sir robert maxwell says 
maxwell who has extensive publishing and television holdings on 
both sides f the atlantic wednesday said hollywood must negotiate 
or face even more onerous restrictions from european nations 
determined to build their own film and television production 
communities 
european community leaders want to stem the americanization 
of europe by us tv programs he said 
he said the ec is certain to adopt a communitywide quota system 
for noneuropean tv shows and individual nations such as france 
may set even tougher quotas 
but hollywood representatives at wednesdays hearing said they 
could not live with a quota system that threatens to erode their 
overseas sales drive up prices and perhaps lead to other 
restrictions 
at stake is a significant portion of the 25 billion surplus of 
trade that the us filmtv industry has with the rest of the world 
a surplus that is likely to grow as more nations look for 
programs to feed onto cable tv and satellite delivery systems 
the american entertainment industry stands to lose a greater 
portion of the european broadcast market if the ec cannot reach 
an agreement and the decision is relegated to the judgment and 
controls of individual european states maxwell told the house 
energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance 
shows such as dallas with its prototypically american 
family the ewings are very popular overseas and such programs 
are relatively inexpensive but maxwell said just 5000 hours out 
of 105000 hours of movies and tapes shown on european tv are 
produced in europe with the rest mainly coming from the united 
states 
that makes it a sensitive issue of money jobs and preserving 
europes cultural diversity maxwell said 
european citizens will not sit in their parlors watching their 
culture replaced by images made in hollywood mexico city or 
tokyo 
the subcommittee is considering possible us responses to the 
television provisions of the ec plan to lower trade barriers among 
its members in 1992 the television without frontiers proposal 
calls for a majority proportion of transmission time where 
practical to be reserved for works of european origin with the 12 
member nations 
it would replace a patchwork of existing restrictions that range 
from tough mandatory quotas in france to quotas that are largely 
ignored in italy to no quotas at all in west germany denmark and 
greece 
the ec has failed twice this year to approve the plan and may 
consider it again in october 
maxwell called the ec plan a soft quota compromise because 
it avoids mandatory limits and he urged congress not to engage in 
a trade war to protect the us entertainment industry 
richard frank president of walt disney studios which offers 
the golden girls and disney movies in europe said american 
producers depend heavily on overseas sales to finance programs for 
us viewing 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america said he welcomed negotiations but if talks fail the 
hollywood community will ask congress to help protect a national 
asset 
subcommittee chairman rep edward j markey dmass told 
maxwell there was strong bipartisan feeling in congress that the 
united states will do what is must to keep markets open overseas

the senate is giving offshore oil drilling and 
timber sales in the northwest a boost but the national endowment 
for the arts is getting a monetary slap on the wrist for supporting 
controversial artists 
lawmakers on a voice vote wednesday approved legislation 
providing 109 billion for the governments land cultural and 
indian programs for the 1990 fiscal year that begins oct 1 
the senate now must design a compromise bill with the house 
which approved an 111 billion version of the measure july 12 
one of the most controversial aspects of the legislation the 
first of the 13 annual appropriations bills that finance federal 
agencies to be passed by both houses this year involves the 
national endowment for the arts 
the bill grants 1702 million to the agency but slaps its 
wrist by cutting 45000 from its budget thats the amount the 
agency granted last year to a pair of controversial photo exhibits 
some lawmakers complained that public money should not have been 
used to display the photos which included homosexual and 
sadomasochistic acts as well as a display showing a crucifix in a 
container of urine 
the senate provided 100000 to the endowment to hire an outside 
contractor to review how the agency determines grant distribution 
and on a voice vote lawmakers adopted an amendment by sen jesse 
helms rnc forbidding the agency to issue funds for materials 
considered obscene or which may be offensive to particular 
religions or to any race sex or nationality 
the bill emerged from the senate with a less favorable edge for 
environmentalists than the house version 
senators accepted the moratorium the house placed on 84 million 
acres of offshore land for oil and gas drilling such moratoriums 
which last a year have been continuous since efforts to open the 
continental shelf to exploration and drilling began in the early 
part of the reagan administration 
but senators eliminated house language blocking the government 
from taking preliminary steps such as public hearings and studies 
to lease tracts off the coasts of the northeast and california if 
the moratorium were lifted lease activities could begin much 
faster if those early steps were already completed 
the senate also rejected house language forcing the government 
to consider buying back the leases of drilling areas off the alaska 
coast which the house had adopted in response to local concerns 
about the recent prince william sound oil spill instead the 
senate ordered a twoyear study of the spills effects on fish 
hatcheries 
a provision that would have barred oil tankers from sailing 
through waters where leasing moratoria are in effect was stripped 
from the bill on a 7227 vote supporters of offshore drilling had 
hoped the clause would put pressure on lawmakers to end the leasing 
restrictions but opponents said the language would needlessly 
boost petroleum prices 
i really think this is punitive and mischievous said sen 
dale bumpers dark 
the senate also stepped into a dispute between timber interests 
and environmentalists freeing up hundreds of thousands of acres of 
federal land in washington oregon and california for logging 
environmentalists would be restricted from using the courts to 
block cutting on some of the land but certain areas would be 
spared to retain a home for the rare spotted owl 
another provision included in the bill by sen robert byrd 
dwva chairman of the appropriations committee requires 
lobbyists helping groups seeking federal grants and contracts to 
register with the government and report their earnings and 
activities it bars them from being paid with the federal money 
they help their clients secure

the boeing co said it will fight a proposed 
200000 government fine linked to allegations that the company did 
not immediately report miswiring of fire extinguishers on two of 
its 757200 jets 
the fine is the largest ever proposed by the federal aviation 
administration against the manufacturer said boeing spokesman jack 
gamble 
boeing denies it was slow in reporting the problem to the 
government and wednesday said the threatened enforcement action 
is unfortunate and unnecessary 
our position is clear we feel the fine is unmerited we 
followed the rules hee said 
boeing reported the miswirings orally to the faa last year 
according to the procedure in place at that time gamble said the 
company has since revised reporting procedures to include an 
initial oral report and a subsequent written report 
the faa said boeing waited until jan 4 to report in writing 
about one case of miswiring it had known about for five months and 
another it had known about for more than two months the problems 
were in the cargo fire extinguishing systems on 757s 
the statement issued wednesday by the faa said boeing failed 
to transmit to faa a report of these miswirings in an acceptable 
form until jan 4 1989 the statement said 24hour notice was 
required 
faa requirements for reporting defects in passenger jets were 
revised in january to tighten the procedure and specify written 
notification gamble said 
gamble said the faa overstated the severity of the problems 
which boeing believes did not seriously compromise the safety of 
its aircraft 
the flap is over defects in which a flight crews attempt to use 
a fire extinguisher such as the release of flamesmothering halon 
gas in a cargo compartment would cause release of the gas or 
another suppressant in the wrong compartment 
after receiving written notification of the 757 wiring problems 
faa officials ordered inspections of all 757s then of all 767s and 
747s produced since dec 31 1980 
crossed wiring or plumbing subsequently was found in 94 planes 
with the problem occurring in all three models none of the 
problems affected airworthiness and all were corrected before the 
planes were returned to service faa officials said in april 
boeing officials subsequently announced design changes to reduce 
the chance of further wiring or plumbing problems 
the largest previous fine proposed by the faa against boeing was 
150000 for selflocking nuts that failed to meet specifications 
in 1987 after a negotiated settlement boeing paid 125000

wednesday 
for all intents and purposes the deals over said checchi 
spokesman david duffy nwa agreed last month to be acquired by 
wings for 121 a share or approximately 36 billion 
as of the expiration date more than 226 million nwa shares had 
been delivered and more than 83 million shares had been tendered 
wings said as of may 31 there were more than 294 million 
oustanding shares of nwa common stock 
wings said it expects to merge nwa with a subsidiary of wings 
shortly 
meanwhile wednesday union pilots at northwest airlines rallied 
outside three airports to vent frustration with the pace of 
contract negotiations which have lasted 28 months 
we dont see progress being made said andy murphy a 
spokesman for the 5000member air line pilots association local at 
northwest there is a real possibility that there could be a 
strike here in a couple of weeks 
despite the harsh talk and informational picketing at northwest 
hub airports in the twin cities memphis and detroit negotiations 
continued wednesday at nwas eagan headquarters josh javits 
chairman of the national mediation board attended the talks for 
the third consecutive day 
the talks were to continue today said northwest spokesman bob 
gibbons 
i think the mere fact that we are negotiating is a positive 
sign said nwa spokesman alan muncaster a lot of rhetoric 
wont help 
before the pilots could legally walk off their jobs the 
national mediation board would have to declare an impasse which 
would trigger a 30day coolingoff period pilots would be free to 
strike and the company would be free to impose its latest offer at 
the end of the period

chrysler corps top managers headed to the 
companys highland park headquarters today to hear details of a 
plan to slash up to 1 billion from the automakers budget 
some whitecollar jobs are in jeopardy a source speaking on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday adding that 1 billion is a 
target figure 
i dont know if thats what we will achieve the source said 
chairman lee iacocca was to present the plan at a regularly 
scheduled meeting of the no 3 automakers top managers 
chrysler like other automakers refuses to discuss specific 
spending plans the company reported profits of 105 billion on 
revenue of 3547 billion in 1988 
in an interview last week iacocca said he has been spending a 
lot of time recently reviewing costs within the company 
we are ambitious in costcutting he said were changing 
a lot of basic things the way we do business 
most economists and industry analysts have predicted a softening 
in the automobile market in the coming year chryslers forecast 
for 1989 sales are the lowest of the big three 135 million to 14 
million cars and trucks during the calendar year 
thats down significantly from the 158 million vehicles sold in 
the united states last year 
chrysler spokesman barron bates said wednesday that the 
costcutting plan didnt involve any plant closings or a 
restructuring of the company 
theres nothing to alter the way the company is being run 
he said weve been wrestling with costs since we bought american 
motors in august 1987 
its tough to get managers to focus on this unless you are on 
deaths door like ford and general motors were back in 1979 he 
said were looking at getting costs out and getting ahead of the 
curve on this recession 
on monday chrysler is scheduled to report its secondquarter 
earnings analysts have speculated earnings will be up slightly 
from the 3204 million the company earned in the same period last 
year

the sluggish growth reflected widespread weakness in bigticket 
consumer spending and housing construction and a sharp 
deterioration in the countrys foreign trade performance 
economists say that further weakness in any of these areas could 
be enough to end the current record peacetime expansion now in its 
seventh year 
inflation is also posing a threat to the economy a gnp 
inflation index shot up at an annual rate of 49 percent in the 
apriljune quarter the fastest clip in more than six years 
the pickup from an increase of 4 percent in the first quarter 
was blamed on a sharp jump in energy prices 
the gnp report which showed an even more sluggish economy than 
many analysts had been expecting represented a setback for the 
bush administrations economic forecasts 
last week the administration issued a revised economic forecast 
predicting economic growth of 29 percent for 1989 as measured 
against all of 1988 
to achieve that level the economy will have to expand at an 
annual rate of 27 percent in the last half of this year 
while many private analysts are looking for the economy to 
weaken further in the second half of the year the administration 
said today that it was looking for a rebound in economic activity 
spurred by recent moves at the federal reserve to lower interest 
rates 
commerce undersecretary michael darby said today he believed the 
nation would be able to avoid a recession as creditsensitive 
sectors of the economy such as consumer spending and housing 
construction respond to the ease in credit 
the economys forward momentum is sustainable darby told 
reporters as inflationary expectations decrease there is room 
for interest rates to decline further 
but many economists are forecasting that growth will slump 
further to an annual rate of around 1 percent in the final six 
months of the year 
such weakness would leave the economy exposed to the danger than 
any unforeseen shock such as a further runup in oil prices could 
bring on the first recession since the 198182 downturn 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co and other 
analysts are looking for a downturn to occur either late this year 
or early in 1990 
we have already had a recession in the housing sector over the 
last six months caused by high mortgage rates sinai said the 
question is whether the economy will be able to strengthen enough 
to offset weakness in consumer spending and weakness in 
manufacturing i doubt it 
with release of todays gnp report for the second quarter the 
government conducted an annual revision of past gnp figures the 
revisions found that the economy grew by 44 percent in 1988 the 
fastest annual growth since a 68 percent increase in 1984 
the 1988 gnp increase had earlier been put at 39 percent 
while the administration is forecasting that economic growth 
will slow to 29 percent this year many private forecasters are 
even more pessimistic 
much of the weakness in the economy reflects a yearlong effort 
by the federal reserve to drive up interest rates in an effort to 
dampen inflationary pressures 
however the central bank switched in june to worrying more 
about a recession than inflation the fed has made three small 
moves since that time to push interest rates lower the 
administration is counting on this credit loosening to be enough to 
revive interest ratesensitive sectors of the economy and keep the 
country out of a recession 
the apriljune gnp report showed the adverse impact of the feds 
previous credittightening moves 
housing construction plunged at an annual rate of 136 percent 
in the second quarter the steepest decline since the first quarter 
of 1982 when the country was mired in the last recession 
personal consumption spending rose at a sluggish rate of 11 
percent while spending on bigticket items such as autos actually 
fell by 4 percent 
trade also contributed to the weakness in the gnp report as 
imports which had actually fallen in the first quarter shot up by 
87 percent in the second quarter the trade deterioration would 
have been even worse except for a healthy 113 percent jump in us 
exports 
the 17 percent gnp increase followed a revised 37 percent rise 
in the first quarter of 1989 a period in which much of the growth 
came from a rebound in the farm economy after the lingering effects 
of last summers drought 
in addition to changing the 1988 gnp growth the annual 
revisions also slightly altered gnp growth in 1986 and 1987 
revising those years to 27 percent and 37 percent respectively

higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade but 
analysts said the move represented a technical correction 
independent of supplyanddemand factors 
wheat futures were slightly lower 
forecasts for isolated showers in the corn belt through the 
weekend limited early gains in the corn and soybean pits but 
recent declines including five straight days of losses in the 
closelywatched november soybean contract were perceived as 
exaggerated and the markets resisted pressure to move lower 
everything is still bearish fundamentally but were due for a 
technical bounce said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 386 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents higher with september at 231 a bushel oats

the nations two largest automakers reported 
lower secondquarter earnings today with ford motor co profits 
down 157 percent and general motors corp off 34 percent 
ford the nations secondlargest automaker said it made 14 
billion or 3 a share during the quarter this year compared with 
166 billion or 343 a share in the same 1988 period 
gm said it earned 145 billion or 223 a share during the 
apriljune period this year compared with 151 billion or 226 
a share during last years second quarter 
gm revenue including its three large subsidiaries rose 13 
percent during the quarter to 336 billion from 3318 billion 
last year fords quarterly revenue was 259 billion up 37 
percent from 2496 in the same 1988 period 
chrysler corp the nations thirdlargest automaker is to 
report earnings monday 
for the first half of the year gm said profits rose 157 
percent to 301 billion or 460 a share from 26 billion or 
382 a share in the first six months of last year 
gm and ford said incentives offered during the quarter put 
pressure on profits and that overseas operations continued to show 
good profitability 
gms north american automotive operations continue to improve 
their operating efficiencies while overseas earnings in 1989 are 
exceeding the record levels achieved in 1988 gm chairman roger 
smith and president robert stempel said in a joint statement 
ford said its overseas automotive operations earned 775 million 
during the quarter up 75 percent from a year ago while earnings 
of its us automotive operations fell 368 percent to 459 million 
earnings declined from a year ago primarily because of lower 
us industry sales and associated marketing expenses and higher 
newproduct development and plant modernization costs chairman 
donald petersen and vice chairman harold poling said in a statement 
fords earnings for the first half of 1989 stood at 304 
billion or 645 a share on revenue of 5176 billion thats 
down from profits of 329 billion or 674 per share on revenue 
of 4815 billion during the first six months of 1988 
earnings from the companys financial services segment which 
handles car loans and other transactions dropped 199 percent 
during the quarter to 1727 million 
the decline in quarterly earnings came as the automaker 
increased its share of the us car market to 227 percent up 08 
percent from a year ago the companys share of the truck market 
remained the same at 294 percent 
ford turned up the heat on incentives in late march by offering 
increased cash rebates and lowinterest financing deals for its new 
cars gm and chrysler quickly followed suit 
since then incentives have remained in the marketplace with 
each of the big three spending hundreds of dollars per vehicle 
fords secondquarter earnings last year stands as the industry 
record and analysts have indicated that record may be around for a 
while 
the automobile and truck markets are softening the incentives 
were introduced to boost sales and shrink inventories built up by 
overly ambitious production schedules 
however customers werent as enticed by the incentives during 
the secondquarter as in the past each company has shut down some 
plants the past few months for longerthanusual vacation times 
model changeovers or to stop the car supply pipeline giving 
dealers more time to sell cars on their lots

fears of political and economic 
instability are inciting people to spirit billions of dollars out 
of brazil at an alarming rate economists and officials say 
a record 12 billion is expected to leave the country illegally 
this year economist clarice pechman one of the countrys leading 
foreign exchange experts said in an interview 
legal profit remittances also are up reflecting decisions by 
many subsidiaries of foreignowned multinationals to send money 
back home rather than reinvest it in brazil 
the dollar drain hurts this economically ailing country which 
desperately needs foreign currency to buy foreign goods for its 
modernization and repay a staggering foreign debt the largest in 
the third world as reckoned by the world bank brazils 
obligations to foreign lenders totals 120 billion 
with hyperinflation just around the corner a government that 
lacks any credibility and all sorts of uncertainties surrounding 
the countrys political and economic future it is only natural 
that those who can will send their money out of the country said 
economist joaquim eloi cirne de toledo of the university of sao 
paulo 
brazils annual inflation rate exceeds 1000 percent the 
government of president jose sarney has been widely discredited 
because four antiinflation programs have failed 
presidential elections on nov 15 add to investors uncertainty 
brazilians will choose their president for the first time in 29 
years following the end of an authoritarian military regime that 
ruled from 1964 to 1985 
miss pechman said that by her reckoning 75 billion left the 
country illegally last year compared with 58 billion for the 
entire 19781982 period the amount is expected to rise again this 
year 
that will bring to 411 billion the amount of foreign 
exchange illegally accumulated in overseas accounts she said 
the economist said she based her figures on statistics from the 
world bank international monetary fund and conversations with many 
brazilbased exporters 
the governments central bank said it had no estimates of 
capital flight 
toledo said the billions leaving the country could be used to 
increase imports of capital goods and hightech products needed to 
modernize our industry and make it more competitive on the world 
market 
the most common illegal methods of getting dollars out of the 
country are via contraband especially of coffee and soybeans 
and by falsifying invoices for exports and imports pechman and 
toledo said 
most contraband operations are done through neighboring 
paraguay where the exporter sells goods for dollars 
in another common scam an exporter might sell for example 
1500 worth of goods but declare just 1000 to the government 
trade bureau the 500 difference goes into the exporters bank 
account outside brazil 
importers do the reverse claiming to pay 1500 for merchandise 
that costs 1000 again they pocket the difference in dollars 
not all capital flight is illegal many big companies are taking 
their money out of this country 
a foreignowned company will always prefer to remit its 
profits rather than reinvest in an economically unstable country 
such as brazil said economist rubens branco of the rio de 
janeiro branch office of arthur andersen the american accounting 
firm 
at a recent debate on foreign capital branco said 
multinationals were expected to remit close to 23 billion this 
year up from 154 billion last year and 909 million in 1987 
toledo of the university of sao paulo said some companies also 
speculate with their remittances by exploiting the huge difference 
between the official exchange rate and the black market dollar 
price 
profit remittances and foreign investments are calculated at the 
official rate in midjuly for example a company wanting to remit 
money could exchange 1 million for roughly 18 million brazilian 
new cruzados about half the black market rate 
the company could then go to the black market pay about 
515000 and get back its 18 million new cruzados which are 
reinvested in brazil the company has 485000 left back home 
toledo said 
finance minister mailson da nobrega said capital flight was 
not a serious problem in a country like brazil although recent 
estimates indicate it has accelerated over the past few years 
nobrega said the only way to slow down capital flight is by 
establishing a climate of confidence because capital flight is a 
product of uncertainty 
despite the ministers denial the government has shown concern 
with the dollar outflow and its drain on the countrys hard 
currency reserves estimated at between 5 billion and 6 billion 
in late june brazil missed a debt payment to foreign government 
creditors claiming it had to maintain its reserves part of the 
payment was made two weeks later 
the government also ordered all foreign exchange operations to 
be made through the central bank in an effort to slow down 
remittances before any bank could make those operations

bond prices advanced in early trading today 
after the government reported a weakerthanexpected increase in 
economic growth adding to speculation that the federal reserve is 
loosening its credit policy 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond was up 1332 point or 4 
for every 1000 in face value at midday its yield which moves 
in the opposite direction from price fell to 807 percent from 
810 percent late wednesday 
the commerce department reported that the gross national product 
grew at a 17 percent pace in the second quarter the slowest 
performance since a 08 percent increase in the third quarter of 
1986 
many analysts had been expecting growth of 2 percent or more in 
the quarter and the slower rate sparked a rally in the bond market 
robert chandross chief economist at lloyds bank in new york 
said traders took the number as an indication that the fed might 
ease further 
he said he felt the fed had already loosened its credit policy 
as indicated by its decision to stand aside for the past few days 
while the federal funds rate traded below 9 percent 
the federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each 
other for shortterm loans and the central bank exerts a powerful 
influence over the rate by arranging temporary sales of securities 
when it wants to nudge the rate higher and buying them for short 
periods when it wants a lower rate 
the federal funds rate was trading at 9 percent at midday up 
from 8 percent late wednesday 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm issues were up 316 point intremediate maturities 
increased about 1132 point and longterm issues rose as much as 
1332 point according to telerate inc the financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value

measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was unavailable

the senate passed a 443 billion agriculture 
spending bill for fiscal 1990 today that grants president bushs 
request to lift the cap on subsidy payments for commodity exports 
the senate which approved the measure on a voice vote must now 
iron out its differences with the 421 billion agriculture measure 
the house passed july 18 the house retained the 770 million cap 
on the export enhancement program 
a report accompanying the bill prods the food and drug 
administration to do a more aggressive job in overseeing the food 
labeling it directs the agency to move forward in clarifying 
definitions of terms such as lite lowfat and natural 
the report also did not contain language that the house approved 
ordering the fda not to ban red dye no 3 until longrange tests 
are finished the food coloring is considered a possible carcinogen 
report language is not legally binding but federal agencies 
generally respect such commands if they do not they risk angering 
lawmakers who can seek retribution in future legislation 
the bush administration wants the ceiling removed arguing that 
it would improve us leverage in the ongoing trade talks between 
the united states and the european economic community 
the house first adopted the cap last year house appropriations 
committee chairman jamie whitten dmiss has said he considers 
the subsidy program to be a boon for large grain trading companies 
the senate legislation would also provide 
49 billion for child nutrition programs including 31 
billion for school lunches 561 million for school breakfasts and 
755 million for food for child care programs that would be a 300 
million increase over this years levels 
21 billion for food assistance to women infants and 
children 100 million more than this year and than bush sought 
154 billion for food stamps 16 billion above 1989 levels 
and 13 billion more than bush requested 
116 billion for rural development and assistance programs

prime computer inc bondholders filed a lawsuit 
seeking to extend the deadline for a 12 billion buyout offer from 
jh whitney amp co pending further disclosures about the deal jh 
whitney said today 
the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court in 
manhattan seeks to extend the offer until five days after jh 
whitney further disloses financing and other conditions of the 
merger the investment firm said in a statement 
jh whitneys buyout offer is due to expire at midnight friday 
the suit was filed by conarb partners which holds 5 percent 
convertible debentures a common type of corporate bond in prime 
whitney said the lawsuit is without merit but did not elaborate 
earlier this week two banks asked jh whitney to obtain 
additional financing before they will back the friendly buyout of 
prime 
prime endorsed the takeover again wednesday and also postponed 
its annual shareholders meeting for a third time to give 
shareholders a chance to review a hostile offer by mai basic four 
inc for primes minicomputer business 
before it adjourned however prime announced a secondquarter 
loss of 19 million due to lower revenues and costs incurred in its 
battle to avoid a hostile takeover 
the company said revenue fell from 4084 million in the 1988 
second quarter to 382 million it reported 273 million in 
nonrecurring charges including 20 million for its merger 
agreement with whitney and related legal fees 
without those expenses prime said it would have had income of 
10 million a slight improvement over this years firstquarter 
results 
whitney emerged last month as a friendly suitor for the 
natickbased hightech concern after prime rebuffed an earlier bid 
from mai basic based in tustin calif 
primes board said the offer from whitney a new york investment 
firm is economically superior to mai basics proposal to buy 
primes minicomputer division for 450 million in cash and 150 
million in notes 
but chemical bank and the first national bank of boston told 
whitney on tuesday to seek additional financing because of 
primes recent performance according to a statement by whitney 
whitney attorney robert coultas declined to disclose how much 
the company needs to raise to meet the banks requirements 
whitney originally offered 2150 a share in cash for 79 percent 
of primes common stock the remaining 21 percent would be 
exchanged for bonds with a face value of 22 a share on wednesday 
whitney extended the deadline for that offer to midnight friday 
a bank of boston spokesman refused to comment on the banks 
request for additional financing a chemical bank spokesman could 
not be reached for comment 
analysts said the banks request may force whitney to lower its 
offer for prime 
barry f willman of new yorkbased sanford c bernstein amp co 
said the uncertainty surrounding the offer may continue to drive 
prime stock down 
the stock has been dropping because of concern about the swift 
completion of the deal he said the risk of the deal closing 
seems higher than it did two days ago 
prime stock was up 1 to 1675 in early afternoon trading on 
the new york stock exchange today 
mai basic extended to midnight thursday its deadline to pay 
1950 in cash for 75 percent of primes shares and a package of 
bonds and preferred stock for the remainder 
believing that deal would fail mai basic recently offered to

a top us trade official said thursday the united 
states wanted to solve its most vexing trade problems through 
international talks rather than direct action against countries 
with alleged unfair trade practices 
warren lavorel told a meeting of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade that the bush administration regarded the current 
gatt round of tradeliberalizing talks as the last chance in this 
century to make far reaching improvements in the way the world 
trading system operates 
the meeting of negotiators from gatts 96 member countries also 
set the deadline for the end of the talks which were launched in 
uruguay in 1986 gatt directorgeneral arthur dunkel said 
dunkel said a ministerial meeting to adopt the final package of 
measures to liberalize international commerce would take place in 
brussels between nov 26 and dec 8 1990 
he told a press conference that completing agreements to cut 
barriers to trade in agriculture textiles and intellectual 
property rights such as patents and trademarks would be the most 
difficult as many governments would have to change domestic 
policies to comply with the new rules 
these areas caused stalemate when ministers met in montreal last 
december to assess progress at the halfway stage of the uruguay 
round 
negotiators are also drawing up new agreements for tropical 
products services like travel and construction tariffs and 
subsidies that are alleged to distort trade 
in a speech to the closed session of the gatt meeting lavorel 
said the united states was committed to multilateral talks to solve 
trade disputes 
we remain firm in our intent to work through the uruguay round 
in order to solve our most vexing trade problems we view the 
uruguay round as the preferred means of solving the very 
troublesome and very real trade problems faced by us industry and 
agriculture he said 
a copy of the speech was made available to reporters 
the united states was criticized by many countries for 
undermining the gatts multilateral principles when it announced in 
may a hit list of three countries accused of being unfair traders 
citing a controversial section of the 1988 trade act the bush 
administration threatened to take retaliatory action against japan 
india and brazil if they did not agree in bilateral talks to remove 
the offending barriers to us exports 
in addition to drawing up tradefreeing agreements gatt also 
acts as a forum for settling disputes its members account for 
fourfifths of world trade

avon products inc thursday said it posted a 
profit of 395 million or 56 cents a share in the second quarter 
in contrast to a loss of 825 million for the period a year ago 
the direct seller of beauty products said its secondquarter 
sales rose 104 percent to 7777 million from 7043 million a 
year earlier 
the companys loss a year ago reflected losses on health care 
businesses that either have been or are being sold 
earnings from continuing operations rose 101 percent to 395 
million from 359 million a year earlier 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive said the 
secondquarter gains reflect the strength of its international 
business particularly in latin america where mexico and brazil 
were leading contributors 
avons international direct selling division had a 27 percent 
increase in pretax profit on a 143 percent sales gain while 
domestic direct selling had a 105 percent pretax profit increase 
on a 24 percent rise in sales 
sales were up 357 percent in its retail prestige fragrance 
division but had a modest pretax loss as it continued to roll out 
new fragrances 
avon said its overall unit sales for the quarter rose 114 
percent including a 32 percent decline in us direct selling a 
251 percent rise in international direct selling and a 29 percent 
rise in retailing 
the company said sales lagged in the us because of the 
distraction in the field sales force caused by a takeover proposal 
and rumors during the quarter 
avon fought off an unsolicited 21 billion takeover bid from 
another directselling company amway corp earlier this year 
avons board rejected the bid and amway withdrew its offer 
for the first six months avon reported a profit of 457 
million or 51 cents a share on sales of 148 billion in contrast 
to a loss of 553 million on sales of 133 billion a year earlier

black americans still lag far behind whites in 
economic and social status according to a report released today 
that says the pace of improvements begun 50 years ago has slowed 
dramatically since the early 1970s 
the great gulf that existed between black and white americans 
in 1939 has only been narrowed it has not closed said the 
report by a national research council committee 
study director gerald jaynes a yale university professor of 
economics and africanamerican studies said persistent negative 
attitudes towards blacks and the disadvantaged conditions in which 
many of them live have held hampered their progress 
a legacy of discrimination and segregation continues to affect 
blackwhite relations jaynes said 
the 27 million study entitled a common destiny blacks in 
american society was financed privately by several foundations and 
charitable organizations 
blacks made their greatest gains during the 1940s and 1960s but 
since the early 1970s the economic status of blacks relative to 
whites has on average stagnated or deteriorated the report 
said 
the report said the gains have come chiefly because of a rapidly 
growing economy that improved the living standard of americans 
overall passage and enforcement of civil rights laws equal 
opportunity efforts and political and social activism by blacks 
the slowdown in the us economy since 1973 has taken a bite 
from the real earnings of all americans but it also has increased 
inequality by hitting hardest the least skilled and those with the 
lowest incomes a clear setback for many lowerincome blacks the 
report said 
blacks have also been hurt by continued racial segregation and 
racial discrimination the report said 
under conditions of increasing economic hardship for the least 
prosperous members of society blacks because of their special 
legacy of poverty and discrimination are afflicted sooner more 
deeply and longer the report said 
the report discounts the popular notion that blacks are consumed 
by a selfperpetuating culture of poverty saying attitudes 
toward work and the desire to succeed are about the same among the 
poor and the better off 
while whites want racial equality in social institutions and in 
government policy many whites are less likely to espouse or 
practice equality of treatment for blacks in their personal 
behavior the report said 
full assimilation of blacks in a color blind society is 
unlikely in any foreseeable future it said but added that 
integrated participation in public affairs is become more 
acceptable 
the study begun in 1985 is based on data and research analyses 
assessing the position of blacks in american society since the eve 
of world war ii the 22member study committee included experts in 
a range of academic specialties 
blacks gained in income and earnings through the 1950s and 1960s 
relative to whites but after that they saw few economic gains the 
report said 
measured in 1984 dollars mean earnings for black men were 
3833 in 1939 compared with 8745 for whites by 1979 the figure 
for blacks rose to 15160 and 23032 for whites but in 1984 
that dropped to 13218 for blacks compared to 20457 for whites 
among women blacks have all but closed the earnings gap mean 
earnings as measured in 1984 dollars have risen from 2070 for 
blacks and 5192 for whites in 1939 to 10252 for blacks and 
10354 for whites in 1984 
since 1939 the gap between the races in terms of poverty has 
remained relatively constant black poverty rates have been two to 
three times higher than rates for whites 
among other findings 
political participation the proportion of federal state and 
local public administrators who are black has risen from less than 
1 percent in 1940 to 8 percent in 1980 blacks comprise 13 percent 
of the us population 
education segregation and differential treatment of blacks 
continue to be widespread in the elementary and secondary 
schools the report said also the odds that a black high school 
student will go to college within a year of graduation are less 
than half the odds for a white student 
health infant mortality rates for blacks and whites have 
dropped steadily since 1940 but a black remains twice as likely to 
die in infancy as a white baby 
crime nearly half of all prison inmates in the united states 
are black and blacks are six to seven times as likely as whites to 
be victims of homicide which is the leading cause of death among 
young black males blacks are also twice as likely to be victims of 
robbery car theft and aggravated assault 
children in 1986 43 percent of black children under 18 
compared with 16 percent of white children lived in households with 
incomes below the federal poverty line about half of all black 
children live in singleparent femaleheaded households compared 
with one in five white children

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade in a modest 
technically inspired recovery from the steep declines that occurred 
earlier this week 
the rally marked the first daytoday advance in the soybean 
market in more than a week 
but experts said the rally had no grounding in supplyanddemand 
factors and that rainy weather forecasts for the midwest and signs 
of a slowdown in grain exports would probably press prices back 
into a downward course 
this was a technical bounce a technical correction said 
victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago everything is still fundamentally bearish 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 389 a bushel corn was 2

they bought calvin klein fragrances this month 
they bought a chicago bank this week the dutch yes the dutch 
rank third in direct investment in the united states 
the long history of dutch investment in america dates back even 
before peter minuit bought manhattan island from the indians for 
the equivalent of 24 mainly in trinkets 
dutch investors hard assets in the united states had a book 
value of 49 billion at the end of last year trailing only the 
british at 102 billion and the japanese at 53 billion 
the dutch investments are lowprofile concentrated in a handful 
of companies that most americans do not even think of as foreign 
shell oil co north american philips corp and lever brothers 
moreover the netherlands is not perceived as a foreign trade 
threat in the same way as fastrising japan holland is one of the 
few countries with which the united states usually has a trade 
surplus owing to dutch imports of raw materials for food products 
and chemicals 
the netherlands was the no 1 foreign investor in the late 
1970s falling to second behind britain in 1982 it fell to third 
behind japan last year according to us commerce department 
statistics 
the figures are for direct investment that is factories 
office buildings real estate and the like rather than paper 
holdings such as treasury bonds 
in the latest major transaction algemene bank nederland nv said 
this week it would buy chicagos exchange bancorp inc holding 
company for 420 million cash 
unilever maker of vaseline qtips lipton all detergent and 
ponds cold cream agreed earlier this month to buy calvin klein 
fragrancies for 306 million 
unilever has dual headquarters in britain and the netherlands 
the two countries divide credit for its 65 billion in us assets 
nv philips whose us operations date to 1933 employs 52000 
people in the united states and has us assets of 38 billion 
those two companies are dwarfed at least in assets by royal 
dutchshell group which has us assets of more than 27 billion 
the company is 60 percent dutchowned and 40 percent britishowned 
so the netherlands does not get full credit for the us assets 
holland is a trading nation whose companies get along in their 
host countries by being inconspicuous that is becoming more 
difficult with the rising tide of emotion over foreign investment 
philips in particular feels unfairly treated by the 
governments decision to exclude it from federal research grants 
for development of highdefinition television 
televisions made by philips under such labels as magnavox and 
sylvania actually have a higher percentage of domestic content than 
televisions made by zenith electronics corp the american maker 
moreover north american philips corp is contributing to 
american knowhow with research facilities in new york and 
california and recently was listed as one of the top 100 usbased 
exporters 
we feel strongly that we are making an important contribution 
as a responsible corporate citizen of the united sates and we feel 
we should be permitted to join these research consortia said 
albert ruttner a vice president of north american philips 
houstonbased shell oil co the us arm of royal dutchshell 
portrays itself as an american company only two of its 10 board 
members are from the parent it has its own overseas operations in 
fact in 13 countries ranging from syria to argentina

the dollar ended higher against most major 
currencies thursday despite a government report showing 
slowerthanexpected economic growth from april through june 
the dollar initially fell in reaction to the report that the 
gross national product grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 17 
percent less than the predicted 2 percent growth 
but the dollar snapped back during later us trading partly 
because it had been oversold in advance of the report said zlatko 
glamuzina chief currency dealer of banco di sicilia in new york 
it was more of the old wall street saying sell on 
expectations buy on confirmation glamuzina said 
also buoying the dollar was hope for a continued rally in the 
stock and bond markets he said 
the japanese yen rose against the dollar mainly because of 
rising confidence in japanese political stability most of the 
yens rise came at the expense of the west german mark

nissan employees voted overwhelmingly 
thursday to keep the united auto workers out of their plant 
denying the union a foothold in the nations fully japaneseowned 
auto factories 
they cant give us anything we dont already have worker 
dotty lockhart said thursday after employees voted 1622 to 711 
against the uaw at nissans sole us plant 
the balloting wednesday and thursday came after an 18month 
drive by the uaw and was seen as a test of union muscle and a 
challenge to automakers strategy of locating plants in the 
traditionally antiunion south 
the union effort also represented a challenge to japanesestyle 
team management and japanese industrys reputation for enlightened 
labor relations 
it was like someone was trying to divide our family worker 
redgie gentry said of the organizing drive at the 6yearold plant 
where pickups and sentra cars are made 
after the vote the uaw accused nissan of misrepresentation and 
intimidation to keep out the union including captive audience 
meetings and a barrage of antiunion videos on the plant tv system 
in which the automaker warned employees would lose benefits if the 
union won 
jerry benefield president of nissan motor manufacturing usa 
denied any intimidation and said he was elated by the more than 
2to1 margin of victory 
i think the results of this election are very strong support 
for the participatory management philosophy here at the company and 
were very happy were going to continue that he said 
workers at the 760 million plant 30 miles southeast of 
nashville have embraced japanesestyle management in which they 
have a say in production and the shop floor is organized into teams 
whose members rotate tasks as often as every two hours 
but the uaw which forced the vote by gathering signatures from 
33 percent of nissans 2400 assemblyline employees claimed that 
the line runs at a breakneck speed injuring an estimated 18 
percent of the workers 
the grievance could not overcome pocketbook issues in this 
socalled righttowork state where union membership is optional 
even at plants where the workers are represented by a union 
the uaw represents workers at joint japaneseamerican auto 
plants but has no foothold in any of the three fully japaneseowned 
factories nissan toyota at georgetown ky and honda at 
marysville ohio an effort to organize the honda plant three years 
ago was dropped before coming to a vote because of lack of support 
it looks as if the japaneseowned plants are going to stay 
nonunion said david healey an auto analyst with drexel burnham 
lambert as long as japaneseowned plants pay the same wages as 
the unionized plants the workers arent going to vote for the 
union 
the vote was considered a showdown of sorts for the 1 
millionmember uaw which has suffered a 33 percent decline in 
membership since 1979 
the uaw represents workers at a mazda plant at flat rock mich 
that also makes fords a joint chryslermitsubishi plant near 
bloomington ill and a general motorstoyota factory at fremont 
calif 
in a statement uaw president owen bieber vice president stan 
marshall and regional director george smith said all this 
election demonstrates is that when a company is determined to 
operate without a union and is willing to use threats and 
misrepresentation to an unlimited extent that company can delay if 
not escape its day of reckoning 
were going to come back said charlie holt a nissan 
quality assurance worker who took part in the uaw organizing drive 
we took a little thumping in round one but we found out we have 
711 strong union people or a third of the plant 
benefield said the vote demonstrates this is a safe place to 
work but he refused as nissan has done all along to release 
the plants injury logs 
nissan has produced more than 1 million vehicles at the plant 
since june 1983 a third model is expected to be added in 1992 
creating 2000 more jobs

coffee futures prices sank to their lowest level in more than 13 
years thursday on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange as a 
market shakeout stemming from the suspension of export quotas 
continued 
on other markets soybean futures rallied ending a fiveday 
slide crude oil futures fell for the fifth straight session 
precious metals retreated and livestock and meat futures were 
mixed 
green unroasted coffee beans settled 122 cents to 193 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in september at 8344 cents a 
pound the lowest price for a nearmonth coffee futures contract 
since early 1976 
analysts said the price drop reflected aggressive new selling of 
coffee by mexico brazil and indonesia in a bid to increase their 
shares of the recently freed market and empty warehouses before 
newcrop coffee hits the market 
coffee futures prices have fallen more than 25 percent since 
july 3 when the 74nation international coffee organization 
suspended export quotas and coffee became a free market 
since then the worlds largest coffeegrowing nations have been 
fighting for market share by dropping their asking prices and 
encouraging exporters to sell as much coffee as they can 
during this week alone colombia announced subsidies enabling 
exporters to sell colombian coffee at prices below production cost 
and mexico said it planned to sell 34 million 132pound bags of 
coffee in the third quarter 
under the quota system they would have sold around 1 million 
bags said esther eskanasy a coffee market analyst in new york 
with cargill investor services inc 
with the new crop coming in less than two months most 
producers are trying to make up volume instead of price she said 
analyst arthur stevenson of prudentialbache securities inc 
said mild winter weather in brazil the worlds largest coffee 
producer added to the bearish sentiment and he said the market 
was ignoring a planned weekend meeting of south american leaders at 
which coffee prices could be discussed 
most grain and soybean futures prices advanced on the chicago 
board of trade in a modest technically inspired recovery from 
steep declines earlier this week 
the rally marked the first daytoday advance in the soybean 
market in more than a week 
but experts said the rally had no basis in supplyanddemand 
reality and that rainy weather forecasts for the midwest and signs 
of a slowdown in grain exports would probably press prices back 
into a downward course 
wheat settled 1 cents to 6 cents higher with september at 
389 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with september 
at 232 a bushel oats 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
september at 143 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents 
higher with august at 668 a bushel 
crudeoil futures fell to a fivemonth low amid persistent 
pessimism on the new york mercantile exchange the market rallied 
early with the september contracts price climbing as high as 
1864 a barrel but prices plunged in a late selloff that 
accelerated when september fell below 1825 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 18 cents 
lower with september at 1812 a barrel heating oil was 23 cent 
to 53 cent lower with august at 4926 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 03 cent to 64 cent higher with august at 5198 cents 
a gallon 
gold and silver futures edged lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange wiping the modest gains of the previous session

underscoring a consolidation in the drug 
industry bristolmyers co and squibb corp said thursday they 
would merge in an 11 billion stockswap deal that would create the 
worlds secondlargest pharmaceutical concern 
under terms of a definitive agreementapproved by the boards of 
both companies squibb will be merged into bristolmyers through a 
taxfree exchange of 24 shares of bristolmyers common stock for 
each squibb share 
based on the current stock price of bristolmyers maker of 
excedrin and bufferin pain relievers and clairol hair coloring 
products the deal is valued at 114 billion 
the merged company will be known as bristolmyers squibb co 
and will offer such consumer products as bufferin and excedrin pain 
relievers windex window cleaner and theragran vitamins plus a 
variety of prescription drugs 
the deal subject to shareholder approval is expected to be 
completed in october 
the companies also agreed to give bristolmyers the option to 
acquire nearly 20 percent of squibbs outstanding common shares at 
12390 a share such options commonly known as lockup 
options often are used to discourage competing bidders 
with annual revenue exceeding 86 billion bristolmyers squibb 
will be one of the largest drug and consumer products companies 
although its sales of pharmaceuticals alone still will trail 
rahway njbased merck amp co 
bristolmyers has some 34000 employees worldwide and squibb has 
about 18000 
following the announcement squibb stock skyrocketed on the new 
york stock exchange the stock began rising last week on rumors 
that the company might be acquired by glaxo holdings plc sources 
said following the defection of a top squibb executive to the 
british pharmaceuticals concern 
squibb finished up 2475 a share at 11250 in heavy trading 
bristolmyers was off 237 at 4950 a share 
the announcement also boosted the stocks of other drug companies 
on speculation they also might be considering mergers among 
gainers upjohn rose 162 to 33 abbott laboratories rose 2 to 
6487 pfizer rose 250 to 6375 and merck a component of the 
dow jones industrial average rose 225 to 7787 
while the emergence of bristolmyers was somewhat of a surprise 
the combination affirms a recent trend in the highly competitive 
and expenseladen drug industry 
on wednesday shareholders of philadelphiabased smithkline 
beckman corp approved a merger with beecham group plc of britain 
creating a company with more than 6 billion in combined annual 
sales last week dow chemical co it would acquired a majority 
stake in marion laboratories inc 
pharmaceutical companies must pump increasingly larger sums into 
their research and development operations if they are to be 
successful in creating drugs to treat complex disorders like aids 
and cancer 
together bristolmyers and squibb spent more than 600 million 
on medical rampd last year 
squibb whose business is almost exclusively limited to 
prescription drugs is an industry leader with capoten a 
cardiovascular drug that brought in more than 1 billion in sales 
last year analysts said the company also is awaiting federal drug 
administration approval for pravachol a cholesterolcontrol 
product with a potentially enormous market 
given squibbs smaller size its ability to have introduced 
capoten before anybody else speaks very well for its rampd 
capabilities said stuart levine a vice president at gruntal amp 
co 
while bristolmyers has a strong market position with its 
anticancer and aids development drugs pharmaceuticals account for 
less than half of its revenue a number of wellknown 
overthecounter brands like comtrex and nuprin and consumer 
products like sea breeze and ban antiperspirant give bristolmyers 
a broader base 
its biggest strength is its diversity said juan noble an 
analyst with argus research although its consumer products like 
drano windex and renuzit are lowermargin than drugs they do 
add a great measure of stability and give it breadth that investors 
look for when things start to get tough 
analysts characterized the price of the deal as fair although 
the sharp rise in squibb stock indicated the company had been 
undervalued although drug companies had performed well over the 
past year their stocks faded in recent months as the dollars rise 
which makes their products less competitive in foreign markets 
alarmed investors 
levine said investors failed to consider that most large 
finanically stronger pharmaceutical companies had builtin leverage 
against the dollars rise and quickly could cut back on expenses 
like advertising if needed 
in a joint statement the companies said squibb would retain its 
identity and continue marketing its products under the squibb name 
the companys headquarters will remain in princeton nj 
richard m furlaud squibbs chairman and chief executive will 
serve as president of the merged company bristolmyers chairman 
and chief executive richard l gelb will serve as chairman and 
chief executive 
furlaud and gelb said in a statement we are confident that by 
combining our respective strengths in pharmaceuticals health care 
consumer products and nutrition we will create an even stronger 
competitor in the health care industry of the 1990s 
while spokespeople for the two companies declined to comment on 
when merger talks got under way gelb said in a statement as we 
met over the past three years to discuss pharmaceutical industry 
matters we were struck by the number of important similarities 
between our two companies

another on overnight loans is considered a barometer of the

oil futures prices slipped to a fivemonth low 
thursday reflecting concern over falling demand and excess crude 
production 
on the new york mercantile exchange the september contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
fell 18 cents to close at 1812 a 42gallon barrel after trading 
as high as 1864 
the nearterm contract last closed lower on feb 24 at a price 
of 1807 a barrel contracts for later delivery had slightly 
smaller losses 
among refined products traded on the exchange unleaded gasoline 
for august delivery fell 064 cent to finish at 5198 cents a 
gallon the september contract closed even lower at 5101 cents a 
gallon down 083 cent 
domestic heating oil for delivery in august closed 023 cent 
lower at 4926 cents a gallon while contracts for later delivery 
this year recorded bigger declines 
crude prices have fallen steadily since early last week 
pressured by falling gasoline prices and rising crude oil 
production in the face of slackening demand 
although statistics from the american petroleum institute showed 
an overall decline in crude oil supplies analysts said there was a 
buildup in some key areas including the gulf of mexico 
there was almost a 4 million barrel build in the gulf coast 
said john hill energy analyst with merrill lynch energy futures 
there was a big draw on the west coast but the gulf coast is 
where most of the refiners are frankly people are saying that 
theres lots of crude oil out there 
in addition an estimate this week put opec production at more 
than 212 million barrels per day higher than the 195 million 
barrel quota the cartel set for the second half of 1989 
gasoline prices have softened recently reflecting what some 
analysts say is consumer reaction to the surge in prices at the 
retail pump

the senate agreed to release the first federal 
construction funds for a planned atom smasher on thursday a 44 
billion project that texans are counting on to bring jobs and 
revenues to their state and scientists to solve a few mysteries of 
the universe 
the implications for this investment in terms of 
transportation and medicine and science and productivity in 
thousands of new products and millions of new jobs cannot be 
measured today sen phil gramm rtexas said before the measure 
was approved on a voice vote 
but an afternoon of routine consideration of a noncontroversial 
bill bogged down when sen john mccain rariz proposed an 
amendment delaying the new surtax on the elderly designed to pay 
for much of the catastrophic care program for senior citizens 
many elderly people have complained that the surtax which would 
cost as much as 800 for the most welltodo among them is too 
expensive 
mccains proposal sparked prolonged back room talks as democrats 
tried to determine how to persuade the arizona lawmaker to withdraw 
his amendment or whether they could defeat him with a floor vote 
in an early evening vote mccain was defeated 5840 
the money for the superconducting super collider which is to be 
built in waxahachie texas is part of an 184 billion spending 
bill for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 for federal energy and 
water programs 
the legislation also includes 42 billion for water projects 
96 billion for nuclear weapons programs and 350 million to 
study a potential highlevel nuclear waste storage site in yucca 
mountain nev 
the bill provides 135 million to begin construction of the 
super collider and 90 million for research and development 
the 225 million was 25 million more than the house provided 
when it approved an 185 billion energy and water bill on june 28 
the two houses will have to reconcile the difference 
the senate legislation would prohibit foreign countries from 
building parts of the project unless congress has reviewed the 
potential assistance some lawmakers have expressed fears that 
overseas firms would take business away from american contractors 
the doughnutshaped super collider to be constructed 
underground with a circumference of 53 miles is to be used for 
research 
it would be the worlds largest particle accelerator capable of 
hurtling two proton beams at each other at nearly the speed of 
light with energies 20 times what is possible in the largest us 
accelerator scientists say their research could help them learn 
about natures most basic building blocks for instance how matter 
originated out of the pure energy of the postulated big bang 
beginning of the universe

new hampshire on thursday conditionally 
approved a 19 billion offer for the bankrupt public service 
company of new hampshire including the utilitys share of the 
troubled seabrook nuclear power plant 
gov judd gregg said the state reserved the right to accept a 
better deal than the bid from northeast utilities new englands 
largest power company 
staggered by debt for the completed but unlicensed seabrook 
plant public service sought chapter 11 protection from creditors 
in january 1988 it was the first major investorowned utility to 
enter bankruptcy since the depression 
a representative of some public service unsecured creditors 
predicted the northeast utilities bid while improving on the 
utilitys earlier offer that excluded seabrook would be turned 
down by unsecured creditors unless it is further sweetened and a 
representative of public service stockholders called the offer 
woefully inadequate 
the new proposal by northeast utilities calls for rate increases 
of 55 percent a year for seven years if seabrook operates 
commercially with another 11 percent a year for five of those 
seven years if the reactor never runs and power must be bought 
elsewhere 
gregg who announced the deal described the rate increases as 
about the same as the expected rate of inflation 
gregg said he gave tentative approval to the northeast utilities 
offer to forestall action by the bankruptcy examiner who he said 
would support a rate plan acceptable to investors but which 
gouges new hampshire consumers 
the earlier offer from berlin connbased northeast utilities 
valued by the utility at 12 billion would have placed public 
services 36 percent share of the 61 billion seabrook plant in 
the hands of unsecured creditors under the deal northeast would 
have bought seabrook power 
public service spokesman nicholas ashooh said the utility had 
not seen the new offer and could not comment but he said 
bankruptcy court approval of the northeast offer is by no means a 
foregone conclusion 
new england electric system of massachusetts has said it wants 
to buy public services nonseabrook assets a revised proposal 
from new england electric is expected next month 
gary hindes chairman of the delaware bay company inc which 
represents holders of more than 200 million of public service 
unsecured debt said the new offer is an improvement over northeast 
utilities previous bid but still not enough 
i think the plan is not going to fly unless they sweeten the 
deal for unsecured creditors hindes said by telephone from new 
york under bankruptcy law all you need is onethird of 
unsecured creditors to shoot it down hindes said 
the deal offers unsecured creditors 90 cents on the dollar 
hindes said his clients would seek 100 cents plus interest 
richard tilton representing public service stockholders called 
the offer woefully inadequate it offers stockholders about 
165 million which is about 400 million too short tilton 
said

chrysler corp will retire or lay off 2300 of 
its 31000 salaried workers by years end as part of 1 billion 
costcutting program mandated by sagging sales and a changing 
market chairman lee iacocca announced thursday 
the cuts are part of a longterm effort to make the 
thirdlargest us automaker more competitive chrysler said 
the program which sources had confirmed on wednesday was 
announced to the companys top 600 managers gathered for a 
regularly scheduled meeting in detroit 
this is not simply a reaction to the current sales 
environment but rather a response to market changes that have 
taken place over the last several years iacocca said recent 
sales have merely returned to normal trend projections and we must 
take the necessary steps to ensure our profitability 
this will not be a oneshot deal its got to become a part of 
our culture 
through july 20 chryslers car sales this year were down 148 
percent from last year while its lighttruck sales were down 04 
percent car sales for all domestic vehicle manufacturers have 
dropped 53 percent for the year while truck sales are off 18 
percent from 1988 
the workforce reduction will be achieved partly through early 
retirement benefits being offered to employees 55 or older with at 
least 10 years at the automaker chrysler has 123000 salaried and 
hourly employees 
iacocca also said there would be cuts in a broad range of other 
segments of the business 
one industry analyst was skeptical of the potential impact of 
the cuts 
this is an industry that kills to take a dollar out of the 
cost of building a car said ron glantz of montgomery securities 
inc in san francisco not very much of this billiondollar 
reduction is going to flow to the bottom line 
they are going to have to reduce advertising and marketing 
which will hurt sales he said 
shortly after chrysler acquired american motors corp in august 
1987 the company cut its salaried work force by about 3600 
people mostly through early retirement and attrition 
company officials and industry observers have said for months 
that buyer incentives offered by chrysler ford motor co and 
general motors corp were likely to cut into profits and keep 
marketing costs high 
that showed up thursday in the earnings reports of general 
motors corp and ford motor co which said secondquarter profits 
were 34 percent and 154 percent lower respectively 
chrysler is to report its second quarter results on monday
