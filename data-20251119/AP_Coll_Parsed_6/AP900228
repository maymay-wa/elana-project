nation of islam leader louis farrakhan says he 
is no enemy of white people or the jews but he claims the us 
government has plotted to kill him according to an interview 
published thursday 
to say that louis farrakhan is antisemitic is an unfair 
characterization of me he said in an interview with the 
washington post 
farrakhan leader of the 10000member black organization who 
has given few interviews has been criticized for his outspoken 
views particularly about jews and israel in his interview he 
said his statements have been distorted by the news media 
louis farrakhan is not an enemy of america not an enemy of 
jews not an enemy of white people he said 
asked about a 1984 statement in which he was reported to have 
called judiasm a dirty religion farrakhan said he was 
referring to the actions of the stte of israel using god and 
religion as a cover for what i said was lying stealing murder 
and i said that jews some of them practice dirty 
religion some muslems practice dirty religion some christians 
practice dirty religion and thats why were in america in the 
condition that were in he said 
a city council resolution last year honoring antidrug efforts 
of the nation of islam at a washington housing project was 
criticized by jewish groups as an implicit endorsement of 
farrakhans views 
farrakhan accused the government of orchestrating the 
assassinations of the rev martin luther king jr and malcolm x he 
said the federal government had plotted to kill him and that the 
cia and other government operatives harass him both in and out of 
the country 
he was not specific and said those operatives will meet the 
wrath of a higher power

theres a new park planned downtown but it will 
be so temporary they might rent the trees 
this just sounds crazy city councilwoman jane noland said 
monday after metro officials briefed the council on their plans to 
spend 400000 to 600000 to build a temporary park at a bus 
station entrance 
metro the regional agency that operates the transit and sewer 
systems for seattle and surrounding king county has used the 
privately owned 144000squarefoot property for the past three 
years to store equipment during construction of a bus tunnel it 
received permission from the city to do so with the understanding 
that once construction was completed the block would be made 
presentable 
intrawest corp which wants to build a retail and office 
building on the site recently took an option to buy the land from 
marathon us realty inc metro officials say landscaping the 
property into a park is one of the cheapest ways to spruce up the 
land until intrawest gets the city permits it needs and is ready to 
build 
because its not clear how long that might take metro is 
considering leasing the trees that will be in the park 
well just send em back when the park moves said gary 
hartnett a design consultant 
robert holmes intrawest president and chief executive officer 
said he hopes to start construction early next year but city 
councilman jim street said it could be two years or more before the 
city gives its goahead

a state social worker has been cleared of a 
charge of failing to report suspected abuse in the weeks before a 
2yearold was fatally thrust headfirst into a toilet for soiling 
his pants 
judge jesse barber on tuesday threw out the misdemeanor charge 
against kenneth houk saying the prosecution hadnt proved its 
case barber granted the acquittal two hours into the trial and 
before the defense even presented its side 
houk was the first of three florida department of health and 
rehabilitative services workers to be tried in the case arising 
from the death of bradley mcgee 
its over said houk who had faced up to 60 days in jail if 
convicted i dont even want to think about it anymore 
prosecutors contended houk twice failed to notify the state 
child abuse registry after receiving reports about bradleys case 
the last call came weeks before the toddlers july 28 death from 
head injuries when the child was repeatedly thrust into a toilet 
for soiling his pants authorities said 
bradleys mother and stepfather sheryl mcgee coe 21 and 
thomas coe 22 of lakeland face trial this summer on murder and 
aggravated child abuse charges 
bradley was abandoned at a shopping mall when he was 3 months 
old and lived most of his life in foster care until the state gave 
him back to the mother and stepfather two months before his death 
the prosecutions case hinged on a july 3 report relayed to houk 
in which a family friend said bradleys mother had forced the child 
to eat feces for violating potty training 
theresa jacobs a prosecution witness who originally reported 
the feces complaint told the jury houk had urged her numerous 
times to telephone the child abuse registry when she had something 
to report 
she said she didnt follow his advice because she never got 
any satisfaction from the registry she also said she did not 
have firsthand knowledge of the alleged abuse 
case worker judy ross was called by the state to confirm reports 
that she relayed the feces complaint to houk but she wavered when 
asked whether she thought such a secondhand report warranted a call 
to the hrs hotline 
after the acquittal defense attorney jack wilkins said 
hopefully this will lead to a different wording of the law 
people who work for hrs must be given the freedom to make judgment 
calls 
assistant state attorney john aguero stalked out of the 
courtroom refusing to comment 
case workers margaret barber and shirley duboise also are 
charged with failing to report child abuse ms barber who had 
been assigned the bradley case also is charged with child abuse 
which carries up to five years in prison

could rhett butler pin nature boy ric flair 
could dorothy put the wicked witch of the west in a halfnelson 
wrestling fans may be betting on such questions if jim herd 
executive vice president of world championship wrestling inc gets 
permission from his boss media mogul ted turner to borrow 
wrestlers names from classic films 
turner owns both the wrestling organization and the rights to 
such movies as the wizard of oz and gone with the wind 
that would be a plus if we had characters patterned after 
these largerthanlife individuals herd said tuesday at the new 
2 million world championship wrestling postproduction studio in 
turners cnn center 
herd said his first attempt would be to have long john silver 
the onelegged buccaneer of treasure island swagger into the 
ring 
i personally think we should approach wrestling from a 
historical viewpoint herd said if i find a 270pound 
6foot5 onelegged wrestler id have long john silver 
turner was out of town tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment but herd said he thinks hell go for the idea hes told 
me personally he likes what hes seeing and if he doesnt hell 
say so he said 
herd isnt worried that controversy similar to that engendered 
when turner began colorizing blackandwhite films could erupt 
over use of the fictional characters 
we introduce controversy every day herd said and robert 
louis stevenson wont get mad at us 
the four hours of wrestling on turner broadcasting systems 
cable superstation each week are among tbs highest rated programs 
herd said 
with the studio wcw will improve the production quality of its 
wrestling programs to compete in todays glitzy atmosphere and 
do interviews with wrestlers to let fans see their human side 
he said 
the new facility complete with wrestlers dressing rooms 
replaced dubbing studios in charlotte nc and dallas and 
contains stateoftheart equipment to provide programming to 178 
tv stations 
the studio and wcws human approach will help the company 
gain a projected 60 million share of the 300 million wresting 
industry in 1990 herd said

a developer that illegally bulldozed more than 
1500 soilconserving mangrove trees to make way for a 
marinacondominium project could be fined up to 25000 per tree 
or 375 million officials said 
the mangroves which play a vital role in floridas rapidly 
disappearing wetlands occupied a 1700foot stretch along a 
drainage ditch next to dumfounding bay part of the intracoastal 
waterway north of miami 
this is probably the largest mangrove destruction case in dade 
county history said robert karafel a code enforcement officer 
for 17 years 
the bulldozing was discovered jan 25 after an anonymous tip to 
the metrodade department of environmental resources authorities 
said monday 
officials at glendale federal bank backers of the project do 
not deny the bulldozing and said they are trying to resolve the 
situation glendale is responsible for any penalty karafel said 
even though we dont believe some of the mangroves were 
significant to the ecosystem we recognize they were removed 
illegally said stanley price an attorney for the thrift its 
just an unfortunate event it really is 
one settlement under discussion would have glendale pay a fine 
reimburse the agency for administrative costs and plant 22680 
mangrove seedlings 
the mangroves which grow along salt water create land by 
trapping soil and provide a haven for sea life in its roots the 
trees are best known for their curly aboveground root system and 
grow to about 25 feet high 
in maybe 25 years you might see what was destroyed karafel 
said when you cut off that food source it has longstanding 
impact on the entire food chain in the bay 
the contractor ryan construction co of sessner had a permit 
to clear only 100 feet of mangroves the thrift said in all about 
1890 trees were destroyed including some buttonwoods inspectors 
said

egypt is combining old photographs 
and american high technology in the most comprehensive 
savethesphinx campaign in 3400 years 
such an ambitious project was last undertaken in ancient egypts 
new kingdom after legend has it a young prince fell asleep in 
the shadow of the sphinx and heard it whisper save me 
the new campaign announced this week by culture minister farouk 
hosni follows years of delay and disagreement over how to save the 
crumbling monument a halfman halflion sculpted 4600 years ago 
the egyptian antiquities organization launched an emergency 
conservation project last year to remove and replace concrete 
blocks and mortar from the sphinxs front paws and haunches 
the new project combines the egyptians restoration work with 
modern monitoring equipment from the united states to discover why 
the sphinx is deteriorating and what to do about it 
protective wooden scaffolding already climbs from the statues 
chest to the top of its cobraadorned headdress the famous 
piercing eyes and subtle smile barely show through 
i must find a way to save it said sayed tawfik egyptian 
antiquities chairman inspecting the monument tuesday not just 
for my lifetime but for the next 2000 years 
tawfik contacted the getty conservation institute which 
provided the monitoring equipment the marina del ray calif 
institute will pay about 200000 for a year of monitoring and pick 
up some of the preservation costs 
people institutions everybody was afraid to touch the 
sphinx afraid theyd be blamed if something went wrong tawfik 
said we have a nickname for it father of terror everybody 
was terrified to help us because the sphinx is so big and so 
famous 
luis monreal the getty institutes director said hes ready 
for the challenge 
you have to imagine that although the sphinx has been around 
almost 5000 years its been covered with sand for all but about 
500 he said since the sphinx was last uncovered in 1925 it 
has been exposed to the modern world 24 hours a day 
we cannot return the sphinx to the way it would have looked to 
the pharaohs but we are confident we can return it to the pristine 
look it had in 1925 if thats the look the egyptians want 
a 200pound 6foottall meteorological station will be perched 
atop the sphinxs back anchored by sandbags capable of recording 
data for one year the solarpowered monitor will record traffic 
vibrations changes in moisture temperature and wind direction and 
the effects of sand salt water and earthquakes 
erosion has gutted almost every part of the mammoth limestone 
statue and experts predict the decay will increase dramatically as 
cairos 14 million population continues to expand 
the first major campaign to save the sphinx was the project of 
the young prince who later became pharaoh tuthmosis iv asleep in 
the shadow of the sandcovered sphinx traditon holds that he saw 
the beast come to him in a dream and heard its promise to lead him 
to the throne if he would free it 
after he became pharaoh tuthmosos had his artisans restore the 
statue about 1400 years later greeks and romans also repaired 
the sacred sphinx with small blocks similiar to those the egyptians 
are inserting today 
monreal said his team has gathered the available literature on 
the sphinxs history including all restoration attempts and ideas 
on how to save it 
he has collected photographs from as early as the mid1800s 
when only the sphinxs head protruded from the sand he said the 
pictures will enable the team to create a computer model of what 
has happened when what could happen and what can be done about it 
the important thing monreal said is the egyptians have 
decided the sphinx must be saved we agree

no man is a hero to his parking valet 
especially if hes a congressman 
politicians are the worst tippers says adam greenberg an 
american university student who earns living expenses as a parking 
valet for blacktie galas and georgetown dinner parties several 
nights every week 
they drive up and say im a congressman park it close 
they go to five parties a night stay for 15 minutes and leave i 
guess they only have so much money to go around for tips he says 
greenberg is one of about 170 parttime employees most of them 
college students who hustle cars for atlantic valet parking 
which handles more than 1000 washington social events to the tune 
of 1 million each year 
its tough work waiting outside for hours in rain snow and 
numbing winds only to be stiffed by an abusive drunk whose 
mercedes wasnt purring at the front door the moment he staggers 
out 
then surprise along comes an old chevy nova who pulls out a 
tenspot says marty janis the companys 26yearold executive 
director and part owner who got his start as a valet parker during 
his senior year at georgetown university six years ago 
finding a safe nearby place to park in a hurry isnt the 
valets only worry janis said 
although car keys are kept on a locator board at big parties to 
avoid mishaps an occasional key is lost or misplaced in the rush 
it becomes a nightmare when the missing keys belong to a vip which 
happened to supreme court justice sandra day oconnor and former 
defense secretary robert s mcnamara 
it was very late and mcnamara wasnt at all happy janis 
said we drove him home got his spare keys and went back when 
our guys finally delivered his car he thanked them and gave them a 
big tip 
janis gets headaches from limousine chauffeurs who block 
traffic and high anxiety from little fender scrapes 
its always a lawyers car and theyll kill you he says 
theyll sue for everything including mental strain 
atlantic the biggest valet parking company in washington 
handles everything from glitzy charity balls for 3000 guests to 
one dinner party where the hosts invited another couple and eager 
to impress hired a valet to park their car 
greenberg a twoyear veteran who works as many as four parties 
a week receives a 5 hourly wage and averages 10 in tips for a 
nights work 
valet parkers are instructed to obey parking regulations at all 
times joyriding is forbidden so is shoving out a hand for a tip 
they are coached to respond to cursing with a courteous smile and 
an apology and they must run never walk to retrieve a car 
theyre trained to drive slow and run fast janis says 
for all its drawbacks says greenberg its a great job 
flexible hours good exercise good money and plenty of 
entertainment 
they might glimpse prince charles or brooke shields at a 
blacktie banquet or watch wellheeled welloiled couples 
fighting over the keys to drive home or shake hands with a tipsy 
tip oneill the former house speaker who once rolled out of a 
party and grandly introduced himself to every parking valet on the 
sidewalk 
one of their favorites is sen edward m kennedy dmass who 
hires them for parties at his suburban virginia home overlooking 
the potomac river 
sen kennedy always talks to us if he can and he makes sure 
we get a bite to eat while were waiting outside greenberg said 
hes one of the best hosts in town 
janis recalls one woman who arrived without an escort for an 
elegant bash and left her car with a valet 
the guy was looking for a parking space on the street when the 
car phone rang he picked it up and said hello and a mans 
voice said whos this he answered the valet parker the man 
said oh yeah sure then click 
when we told the lady who owned the car she laughed janis 
said she said oh that must have been my husband i came alone 
because we just had a big fight

both presidentelect violeta barrios 
de chamorro and the sandinistas demanded tuesday that the contra 
rebels immediately disband but the defeated ruling party set tough 
conditions for a peaceful transition of power 
the causes that started the civil war in nicaragua have 
disappeared mrs chamorro said in a radio broadcast thats 
why those who took to the hills should now lay down their guns and 
return peacefully to nicaragua with their families to work for the 
reconstruction of our motherland 
earlier the top contra leader israel galeano said from 
tegucigalpa honduras that the rebels would not disband until 
after mrs chamorro is inaugurated april 25 for a sixyear term 
the sandinistas defeated two days early by an opposition 
coalition in a stunnign upset insisted tuesday that industries 
remain nationalized land seized from largeholders remain in 
peasant hands and the usbcked contras disband immediately 
a change of government does not mean the end of the 
revolution president daniel ortega told a cheering crowd of 
thousands after a meeting of sandinista party leaders 
he read a statement from the party leadership that said it would 
turn power over to the united national opposition uno but still 
had the responsibility to watch over and guarantee the continuity 
of the revolutionary process 
ortegas speech came before the chiefs of both sides transition 
teams had their first meeting former president jimmy carter who 
is acting as a mediator for ortega and mrs chamorro also attended 
the private procoalition radio corp said working session were 
to begin wednesday 
mrs chamorro accused the sandinistas of using state radio 
sandino to stir up the population referring to the stations 
transmission monday of hundreds of calls from supporters who 
expressed opposition to her victory 
she said she agreed with cardinal miguel obando y bravo who 
asked the news media during a mass to publicize the idea of 
reconciliation because if they dont god save nicaragua 
in a radio broadcast later mrs chamorro called for the 
immediate demobilization of the rebels and promised to respect 
the rights of the roughly 40 percent of the electorate that voted 
for the sandinistas 
the sandinista statement said the party as the strongest most 
cohesive political force in the country would oppose any change in 
its agrarian reform nationalization of banks and foreign trade 
the statement also demanded the jobs of all public workers be 
guaranteed 
privatization is a fundamental part of unos economic program 
the opposition hopes to reduce the public sector and return 
inefficient stateowned industries to the private sector 
the statement also said the sandinistas would defend the 
integrity and professionalism of the army and the police forces 
control of military and police forces is considered the most 
delicate issue in negotiating a transfer of power they are closely 
identified with the sandinista party and the army is known as the 
sandinista peoples army not the nicaraguan army 
uno has promised to eliminate the draft and reduce the size of 
the armed forces 
sandinista officials have insisted they cannot give up control 
of the army or the police until the guerrilla war financed mainly 
by the former reagan administration is definitively ended 
carter told reporters he believed the sandinista concerns about 
the contras and the military were reasonable 
they have expressed their conviction that this has got to be 
done before they are willing in effect to leave the country 
defenseless or to turn over their ability to defend the country 
from an attacking army from honduras i think this is a reasonable 
statement of fact its not an ultimatum or demand said carter 
after he read his statement ortega emphasized that the party 
planned to turn over the reins of power to uno but said uno voters 
would soon discover their mistake 
everyone who voted for uno will vote for the sandinista 
front in the future he said the ball is in the other court 
uno officials seemed unworried by ortegas speech 
like we say here this is just the drowning man kicking but 
were not worried about it even though its not in our hands to 
demobilize the contras there are ways political ways to let 
them know how we feel said gilberto cuadra a chamorro adviser 
and prominent businessman 
azucena ferrey a former member of the contra directorate also 
seemed unconcerned about demobilization theres no problem with 
that she said 
but galeano said the contras wouldnt disband until after the 
inauguration of mrs chamorro publisher of the opposition 
newspaper la prensa 
we are a cancer that no one wants that is why we should act 
with caution said galeano 
carter however said he was trying to help the parties define 
the issues and find a common ground 
at the transition team meeting mrs chamorros soninlaw and 
campaign manager antonio lacayo led her team and ortegas brother 
humberto the defense minister led the sandinista team radio 
corp reported 
carter said prior to the meeting that humberto ortega and 
interior minister tomas borge in charge of police forces had 
agreed to give up their posts 
one concern for uno he said was that the sandinista army is 
written into the constitution and uno will be several votes short 
of a twothird majority even if they maintain their unity 
complete elections results for the national assembly were not in 
but the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario said it estimated 
uno would win 52 seats the sandinistas 38 and the social christian 
party one 
as the defeat of ortega sinked in tuesday about 15000 
sandinista loyalists showed up in front of the olof palme 
convention center after word spread that 1500 sandinista national 
regional and local leaders were meeting 
we will give up the government but not our weapons said 
lester rivera a member of the sandinista youth 
the general election was monitored by more than 3000 
international observers including the united nations the 
organization of american states and a delegation led by carter 
they all pronounced the voting free and fair and the count clean 
according to the latest preliminary returns mrs chamorro took 
55 percent of the vote to ortegas 40 percent with 82 percent of 
the precincts counted

the largest organization of older americans 
says an illtimed cut in social security taxes could destroy 
confidence in the pension system and make it harder to reduce the 
federal deficit 
but unless government officials can significantly reduce the 
deficit a tax cut may be a good idea once social security 
surpluses are sufficient to cover benefits for 18 to 24 months the 
american association of retired persons said tuesday 
aarp and two smaller organizations of senior citizens agreed in 
testimony before the senate finance committee that the government 
must stop using surplus social security taxes to hide the size of 
the overall deficit 
the house ways and means committee took a step in that direction 
tuesday by recommending that social security revenues not be 
considered when the overall deficit is calculated 
the finance committee is considering a bill by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny that would reduce social security taxes 
for workers and employers so that surpluses could no longer be 
available to mask the deficit 
the current system creates the illusion that the social 
security surplus can be used to pay for general government 
expenditures said lawrence t smedley executive director of the 
national council of senior citizens in a word the current 
budget system is dishonest 
smedley said taxes could be cut once reserves are sufficient to 
cover 15 to 18 months of benefits which probably would not be 
before 1993 
martha mcsteen president of the national committee to preserve 
social security and medicare said that since the budget is 
unlikely to be balanced soon the other way to keep government from 
spending surplus social security taxes is to eliminate them with a 
tax cut 
its much like getting rid of the ice cream and doughnuts 
before you go on a diet she said you remove the temptation 
and force yourself to make tough decisions 
aarp director judith n brown told the finance committee that 
cutting social security taxes just when the system is building 
needed reserves could weaken public confidence and support but 
she said a tax cut may be advisable once the reserves are built up 
so social security revenues arent used to reduce the deficit 
she said that unless other taxes were raised or spending cut to 
make up for the 55 billion a year that moynihans bill would lose 
the overall deficit would rise further increasing government debt 
and slowing the economy 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan advised against cutting 
social security taxes or taking the system out of the budget 
the current structure of social security may not be 
appropriate in all circumstances he said but at present it 
is still the best option 
greenspan said proposals to cut taxes and take social security 
out of the deficit calculation could reduce pressure for real cuts 
in the deficit and increase the difficulty of providing for the 
needs of an aging population in a way that is equitable across 
generations 
greenspans contention that a social security tax cut might 
destabilize the economy conflicts with a new study by two former 
treasury department officials 
economists aldona robbins and gary robbins argue that over 10 
years moynihans tax cut would increase the gross national product 
by 346 billion create 930000 jobs and raise investment capital 
by 162 billion 
unless the social security system is changed the robbinses 
wrote 
todays average 30yearold worker who will retire in 2025 
could see his income taxes rise by 20 percent if the government is 
to meet its social security promises 
these higher taxes will be equivalent to a 7 percent 
reduction in his or her social security benefits what the 
government gives with one hand it will be taking away with the 
other 
the study was done for the institute for policy innovation a 
dallas research organization

when bruce gelb traveled to moscow 30 years 
ago as a businessman the russian phrase he heard most often was 
its impossible 
now as director of the us information agency and chief us 
negotiator in talks aimed at increasing the flow of information 
between the superpowers the russian phrase he hears most often is 
why not 
gelb and soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky say 
the latest round of ussoviet information talks which opened 
monday have cleared the way for signing two cultural agreements at 
the superpower summit planned for june in the united states 
one deal would allow the us and soviet governments to open 
cultural centers in each others capitals petrovsky said 
the second on president bushs open lands proposal would 
reduce restrictions on us and soviet diplomats and journalists 
working in each others countries gelb said in an interview in his 
office tuesday 
the mood of the current information talks is considerably 
friendlier than the first round two years ago when gelbs 
predecessor charles wick stormed out of a meeting in moscow after 
soviets accused us scientists of inventing aids 
us officials have complained for years that soviet media 
carried disinformation of which the aids allegation was the 
most famous example gelb says such soviet activities have 
dropped down to an extremely low level 
mutual recriminations have not disappeared from the talks but 
virtually every one of the problems here has been described as a 
mosquito that should be swatted gelb said 
during this round the soviets complained that voice of america 
a usia radio station broadcast inflammatory remarks in january 
during unrest in azerbaijan a mostly moslem republic on the soviet 
border with iran 
we are looking into it gelb said 
soviet officials want to remove barriers to information from the 
west because they now realize that they cant keep information 
out gelb said 
moreover they want to learn how the west works the information 
talks this week included a working group on us public opinion 
surveys and the soviets have asked to send observers to a meeting 
of the us national association of broadcasters later this year 
gelb said 
the thirst for knowledge in the soviet union and eastern europe 
is straining us resources 
usia runs a 6 million program to foster democracy and 
capitalism in poland and hungary but that is far from enough 
right now we have the resources to get halfway across the 
ditch we must scramble up the other side gelb said 
among the other developments at the information talks the 
soviets have agreed to stop unlicensed mediumwave broadcasts from 
cuba to the united states and are ready to lift a ceiling of 
150000 on copies of the usia russianlanguage magazine america 
distributed in the soviet union 
the soviets also appear ready to allow a second voa 
correspondent to work in moscow said gelb before the reforms voa 
reporters were not allowed in the soviet union and the radio 
station was regularly condemned by official soviet media

its an administration where even the 
agriculture secretary and the chairman of the council of economic 
advisers are well advised to keep their passports handy 
its a presidency where domestic issues sprout international 
wings and golfing weekends turn into summits 
foreign policy dominates the presidency of george bush while 
domestic issues usually get second billing 
thats partly because of the breathtaking march of world events 
and partly because a stillgrowing economy has taken some of the 
rough edges off many homegrown problems 
but its also because bush despite his protests of wanting to 
be remembered as the education president and the 
environmental president seems to be most content when hes 
immersed in foreign policy 
this has been a very unconventional presidency everythings 
upside down said mitch daniels a white house aide in the reagan 
administration 
the old rule was you worked the domestic agenda until you ran 
out of steam then gassed up the plane and went abroad and made 
headlines said daniels who heads the hudson institute a 
conservative indianapolis think tank it is striking at how 
different a pattern it is from the one we have become accustomed 
to 
bush a restless man is even turning what was planned as a 
golfing vacation in palm springs calif into a twoday working 
session with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
bush a former un ambassador china envoy and cia chief was 
leaving today for the sixday western trip that includes the kaifu 
meeting 
not only has bush spent most of his time focusing on foreign 
policy but much of his domestic agenda has assumed international 
dimensions 
thus agriculture secretary clayton yeutter commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher and michael boskin chairman of the council of 
economic advisers were dispatched to poland recently to instruct 
poles on the ways of freemarket economies 
boskin got another international assignment this week he was 
named by bush to help oversee an upcoming international conference 
on global warming 
the war on crime one of the most domestic of all issues has 
been largely overshadowed by the war on drugs a battle with a 
major international component 
bush and national drug policy director william bennett recently 
attended a daylong fournation drug summit in violencetorn 
colombia to discuss ways to stem the flood of south american drugs 
into the united states 
a followup meeting is expected in the summer and bush has 
talked about convening another drug summit next year that will 
include european nations 
bush has been to 16 countries as president members of his 
cabinet are not far behind 
secretary of state james a baker iii is on the road constantly 
treasury secretary nicholas brady today was wrapping up a 
fournation swing through europe 
attorney general dick thornburgh was in moscow in october and 
earlier visited spain and uruguay 
louis sullivan secretary of health and human services was in 
israel and egypt meeting with health officials last month last may 
he went to geneva for a world health organization meeting and hes 
scheduled to go to london april 710 for a conference on drug abuse 
education secretary lauro f cavazos was sent by bush to bolivia 
last august for the swearingin of president jaime paz zamora 
and bush himself plans to get some more visa stamps on his 
passport usa no 1 aides said bush is considering a trip in 
september to argentina and chile and likely will go to australia 
africa and asia within the next year or two 
is bush giving undue attention to foreign policy no says rep 
dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee 
i think the dynamics of world events have given no one any 
choice not the president the congress nor the media fascell 
said in an interview 
after all when nicaraguans went to bed on sunday it was 
under a marxist regime they woke up in a democracy and thats 
remarkable he said

the soviet union with strong backing from the 
united states played an effective behindthescenes role in 
encouraging nicaraguas leftist government to hold an honest 
election last sunday a senior official says 
the official listed the soviet role among a number of key 
elements which persuaded the sandinista authorities that free 
elections were their best hope for obtaining legitimacy and 
international economic support 
the source spoke to reporters tuesday after president bush 
conferred with congressional leaders about his plans for a 
significant and meaningful assistance program for nicaragua in 
the approaching postsandinista era presidentelect violeta 
chamorro takes office april 25 
sen sam nunn dga said aid for nicaragua probably would run 
into hundreds of millions of dollars over five years and he 
suggested the creation of an emerging democracy account to help 
nicaragua panama and the east european countries 
the white house said it liked the idea if it meant the 
administration would have more flexibility in dispensing us 
foreign aid at present congress earmarks almost all aid for 
specific countries leaving the administration with few 
discretionary funds for unexpected developments 
mrs chamorros chief economic adviser francisco mayorga 
arrives in washington on monday to discuss us economic 
cooperation with nicaragua 
for most of the sandinista rule in nicaragua the soviets were 
widely portrayed in washington as intent on establishing a 
communist beachhead there for promoting subversion and engaging 
in other activities hostile to us interests 
but a far different picture of soviet behavior emerged tuesday 
from the state department briefer who spoke to reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
much of what he said had been reported previously but taken 
together the soviet activities in some ways suggested a strong 
commitment to a peaceful settlement in central america 
as described by the official the united states invariably 
raised the central america issue at highlevel meetings with the 
soviets throughout 1989 
there were some anomalies to the soviet behavior the 
official said noting that moscow sent highperformance helicopters 
to the sandinistas last month and has continued to provide 
largescale assistance to cuba 
cuba in turn has continued to support the leftist insurgency 
in el salvador the official added 
the official recalled that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
informed bush last may that the kremlin was no longer providing 
direct military assistance to the sandinistas 
in august he said the soviets were instrumental in persuading 
the sandinistas to make concessions to opposition groups that 
enabled them to campaign freely for votes in sundays election 
last september the official added secretary of state james a 
baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze committed 
themselves to support a halt in the use of central america for 
subversion and they called for an end to outside aid to rebel 
forces 
at their most recent meeting two weeks ago baker and 
shevardnadze stressed the importance of impartial and effective 
international observation of the electoral process and promised to 
respect the outcome of the election 
we believe that the soviet union played a constructive role in 
encouraging the sandinista government to hold these elections 
the official said 
hours before the official spoke a soviet foreign ministry 
official in moscow told a news conference that the kremlin 
recognizes the results of the nicaraguan election and is prepared 
to negotiate with the new leadership about future relations 
ion burlaia the deputy chief for latin america in the foreign 
ministry said the soviets would continue to give nonmilitary aid 
to nicaragua if the new government wants it and also was prepared 
to negotiate future trade and military cooperation

in the cafes meeting rooms and streets of little 
havana cuban exiles say the electionbooth ouster of nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega shows fidel castros fall is finally within 
reach 
euphoria took hold here as democratic changes began sweeping 
eastern europe now that a domino effect has put panamas manuel 
noriega in jail and appears to have knocked ortega from power many 
exiles say castros downfall is inevitable 
in the streets the cubans are saying yesterday was manuel 
today is daniel and tomorrow is fidel that is the popular 
joke said tomas garcia fuste a commentator at the 
spanishlanguage radio station wqba never before have we been so 
close 
i have convinced myself that well have a chance to go to cuba 
within the year 
the stunning upset by the opposition in nicaragua shows it is 
impossible to predict the amount of support a dictator enjoys from 
his people said jorge mas canosa director of the rightwing cuban 
american national foundation 
cuban people love democracy and freedom as much as their 
neighbor mas canosa said tuesday most cubans must be asking 
why not in cuba why not on the island 
in miami business owners are preparing to cash in the untapped 
consumer demand of 10 million people if the united states renews 
trade with a democratic cuba 
some of the citys estimated 700000 cuban exiles are delaying 
vacations and putting off buying houses hoping their decadesold 
refrain next year in havana might come true 
its not only our feeling castro is in his countdown said 
modesto castaner a veteran of the illfated bay of pigs invasion 
in 1961 the cuban people are standing by for something to 
happen 
the excitement among exiles is growing stronger despite evidence 
that castro 62 remains as strong as ever 
cubas communist leadership facing widespread food shortages 
and possible cuts in the 5 billion in annual aid the country gets 
from the soviet union rejected multiparty rule at a meeting feb 
16 while calling for some reforms to perfect the revolution 
castro led 31 years ago 
about 5000 people ready to go to work in a new cuba have signed 
on with the group called cuban municipalities in exile in a project 
begun several weeks ago the names on the list include builders 
doctors plumbers teachers and farmers said roberto rodriguez 
aragon the groups president 
mas canosas group has arranged for conservative economists 
milton friedman and arthur laffer to help prepare a plan to 
transform cuba to a freemarket economy gov bob martinez has 
appointed a commission to study the impact on florida of an end to 
castros rule 
even miami police are preparing for a huge party 
if tomorrow castro dies you will see the greatest day in 
miami since its foundation everything will come to a stop it will 
be a tremendous celebration said castaner 
cuba is close to hitting rock bottom said maria christina 
herrera head of the institute for cuban studies which has 
advocated dialogue with castros government it can move no 
further backward it can move forward or else 
some rightwing cuban exiles say theyll do whatever they can to 
make the change come soon after training for years in isolated 
military camps in the everglades castaner says his group is just 
waiting for the right signal 
but we dont want to create a situation where people think 
were going to invade tomorrow castaner said from the 
headquarters of brigade 2506 in little havana were collecting 
names and phone numbers should anything happen immediately 
its unclear how many exiles would return to the island to stay 
for a generation of cubanamericans living in cuba has been 
just a dream kept alive by older relatives and politicians exiles 
have fostered a thriving culture in miami where the cuban 
lifestyle is prevalent speaking english isnt necessary and many 
government services are available for the asking 
the emotion will bring them over there but the reality will 
bring them back said horatio villazon 71 as he played cards in 
maximo gomez park a street corner in little havana named for a 
hero of the cuban independence movement they are dreaming and 
playing politics

the department of veterans affairs says it is 
considering several changes in benefits including a stricter 
definition of serviceconnected disability and a uniform death 
benefit 
other possible changes include an extension of psychiatric 
disability payments for disturbed veterans while they try to get 
jobs and a shorter waiting period before people can claim total 
serviceconnected disability 
va said tuesday the possible changes are part of an effort to 
put more emphasis on less expensive outpatient care and expand 
eligibility for nursing home care 
undersecretary anthony principi who heads the group studying 
the changes said the va is trying to bring the system up to date 
with the trend in modern medicine to more ambulatory care 
he said va wants more emphasis on prevention and more use of 
alternatives to hospitals such as hospice care for the terminally 
ill 
any proposal to change serviceconnected disabilities is bound 
to be controversial nearly 22 million veterans receive such 
payments ranging from 67 to 1500 and even higher for some of 
the totally disabled the total annual cost is close to 9 billion 
currently any disability that arises during military service is 
considered to be serviceconnected entitling the veteran to 
compensation payments based on the degree of disability 
the possible tightening would rule out disability payments but 
not va medical care for disabilities that would have arisen 
regardless of the individuals vocation 
diabetes for example would be excluded so too would aids if 
contracted from injecting drugs 
the va released details of the proposal after a veterans group 
released details during a congressional hearing on tuesday 
va said some of the proposals released by the disabled american 
veterans had been abandoned such as the proposed elimination of 
costofliving allowances for certain disabled veterans and for 
different disability payments for wartime and peacetime veterans 
any proposed changes would have to be approved by the office of 
management and budget before being sent to congress 
va said the proposals being considered would not be retroactive 
the only exception would be to increase the death benefit 
retroactively for survivors of lowerranked veterans 
benefits range from 539 a month for survivors of privates and 
corporals to 1381 for survivors of generals and admirals the 
possible change would create a uniform payment of 700 to 750 a 
month 
those benefits cost about 23 billion a year with the largest 
share going to the lower ranks 
another possible change would be to shorten a veterans wait 
from 20 years to 10 years before being able to receive the 
permanent disability classification 
principi said that paying psychiatric disability payments for a 
year while a person tried to hold down a job would pay for itself 
by encouraging people to get better

on the streets of sandinista defeat 
the redandblack banners still flutter defiantly from almost every 
lamppost 
the blueandwhite of the victorious united national opposition 
is visible only in flashes the blueandwhite cap on the driver 
as a pickup truck goes by a few posters on a wall that doesnt 
face the street 
many people believe nicaragua became a democracy at 6 am 
monday when president daniel ortega tired eloquent defiant 
said his sandinista party would obey the will of the voters 
but the victors are just beginning to emerge from their shell 
shock and the losers are holding their breath 
it is two months to april 25 when violeta barrios de chamorro 
the symbol of resistance to 10 years of sandinismo is sworn in as 
president 
i still cant believe that uno won maritza arguello wife 
of a coffee grower said tuesday im just sitting quietly until 
it actually happens 
they didnt dare celebrate in the streets theyre cockroaches 
that are staying hidden said mercado gonzalez de lopez a member 
of a sandinista womens group 
she and five friends had come from a poor neighborhood to stand 
in front of the government radio station and demonstrate their 
support for their beloved daniel 
this managua of defeat and victory is also a city of pain 
everyone has a story a story that makes them fearful or cautiously 
optimistic about the future 
the pain of defeat can leap out unexpectedly even for the 
sufferer as it did in a party official who was asked to move his 
car so that another could be moved in a jammed parking lot 
youre a foreigner youre a foreigner have a little 
respect the man suddenly yelled furiously 
karina quiroz de marin is one of the happy fearful 
im happy but the people arent celebrating because they fear 
the turbinas she said 
the turbinas or turbas the disturbers are the violent crowds 
of young sandinistas that were used for so long to awe or cow the 
opposition 
there was a time when ortega called them divine but now he is 
working for reconciliation hugging his opponent telling his 
supporters they must defend the achievements of the revolution but 
respect the vote 
mrs marins story begins with a traffic accident her 
husbandtobe was hit by a car running a red light the car 
belonged to a high government officials escort 
her fiance was beaten and suffered broken facial bones she said 
mrs marin saved the bills including the bills for repairs to 
the official car in case there was a day she could present them 
not for payment she said just so people will know 
what she is now is a black market moneychanger as her pink 
polo shirt shows the profession has been good to her despite the 
risk of jail 
amanda pinero also at the voice of nicaragua said she feared a 
return of dictator anastasio somozas national guard that fear may 
owe something to sandinista campaign strategy of linking the guard 
to ussupported contra guerrillas and the opposition coalition 
the long contra war caused enough pain on both sides to fill an 
ocean 
it ended in military victory for the sandinistas at a cost of 
60000 lives in a nation of 3 million but now suddenly it seems 
to many that the contras somehow won 
the guard threw me out of my house said pinero a 
66yearold widow its hard for me to see the guard return they 
the contras killed my only son she stops its the pain he 
was the only thing i had 
for many the radio stations have been an outlet while a 
station that supports uno broadcasts rousing songs about violeta 
and seldomfounded rumors that a sandinista crowd is gathering the 
sandinista airwaves resound with fury and sorrow 
callers urge daniel to ignore the vote because it was stolen or 
bought they accuse international observers and journalists of 
ignoring their complaints they say they will do what the party 
says and stand by daniel forever 
former president jimmy carter said uno was concerned about the 
violent sentiments expressed 
although i regret it maybe thats a good way to let them vent 
their feelings and let off steam he told a small group of 
reporters tuesday 
thousands of sandinistas vented their steam at an impromptu 
rally tuesday outside the olof palme convention center when the 
sandinista party called its leadership from city town and country 
to explain how the party would conduct itself as an opposition a 
powerful opposition but an opposition nonetheless 
like many government workers at the rally angel madrona said he 
was thinking about a new job 
well see what the directorate says he said if they want 
me to work for the uno government i will but i dont want to 
madrona a public relations worker at the ministry of foreign 
cooperation which coordinates foreign aid to nicaragua said he 
would probably do the previously unthinkable and move to the 
private sector 
the crowd gathered through the afternoon as word spread that the 
leadership was meeting the old chants and cheers echoed until late 
afternoon when ortega finally spoke 
treading carefully between militancy and conciliation he said 
the revolution would not end 
a change of government does not mean the end of the 
revolution he told the crowd which cheered and started to march 
through town 
ortega suggested they go to carlos fonseca plaza an 
outoftheway location on the lakeshore where ortega spoke in 
preelection triumph only wednesday to 300000 people 
but minutes later one of managuas heavy rainstorms broke and 
though a small cohort marched on most of the crowd leaked away in 
search of shelter from the storm

prisonerrights advocates disappointed by a 
supreme court decision say theyll continue to fight on the state 
level to assure inmates are not given antipsychotic drugs 
indiscriminately 
the trend is for state courts to give more protection to 
inmates than the supreme court said brian reed phillips a lawyer 
for a washington state prisoner forced to take the drugs 
the justices by a 63 vote tuesday said prison officials dont 
need a judges permission before forcing inmates to take the drugs 
robert d fleischner representing a prisonerrights coalition 
in massachusetts said some states guarantee a judicial hearing 
before prisoners can be forced to take the medication 
massachusetts requires judicial intervention and the system 
has worked to protect peoples rights he said requiring the 
appropriate care has not been overly burdensome 
washington state correction secretary chase riveland said 
tuesdays ruling wont lead to a medication binge for disruptive 
prisoners 
im not suggesting that we should be willynilly running 
around medicating people he said i think that if 
medically appropriate its very helpful 
riveland said the ruling may affect 10 to 15 washington 
prisoners 
the supreme court ruled that prisoners rights are safeguarded 
as long as staff psychiatrists say the drugs will help and not 
merely pacify the inmates 
an inmates interests are adequately protected and perhaps 
better served by allowing the decision to medicate to be made by 
medical professionals rather than a judge justice anthony m 
kennedy wrote for the court 
but the dissenters led by justice john paul stevens said the 
ruling means prison officials seeking to maintain order may force 
inmates to take dangerous even lifethreatening drugs with little 
regard for the prisoners wellbeing 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 54 in a florida case that patients involuntarily 
committed to state mental hospitals may sue officials in federal 
court for monetary damages over failure to get legally required 
hearings 
ruled unanimously that the boeing co did not violate a federal 
conflictofinterest law when it paid 485000 in severance to five 
employees who left to take government jobs 
the prisoners rights decision overturned a 1988 washington 
state supreme court ruling that convicted robber walter harper 
diagnosed as schizophrenic must be given a court hearing before he 
is given antipsychotic drugs 
the case pitted the american psychiatric association which 
supported the prison officials against the american psychological 
association 
clifford stromberg a lawyer for the psychologists group said 
the court unfortunately seems to have underestimated the danger 
of these drugs particularly when no objective decisionmaker 
decides when theyre going to be used 
harper paroled on condition he take the drugs was returned to 
prison after he attacked two nurses at a seattle hospital back in 
prison he refused in 1982 to take the medication saying it was 
poisoning his brain and causing other side effects 
he sued when prison officials forced him to take the drugs the 
officials said the drugs were for his own good and needed to 
control his violent behavior 
the state supreme court calling the drugs as intrusive as 
electroshock therapy ruled that an inmate who has not been found 
mentally incompetent has a right to determine what should be done 
to his body 
while the drugs are beneficial to seriously ill patients they 
also can have serious side effects ranging from involuntary spasms 
to permanent brain damage 
prisonerrights advocates say physical restraints or isolation 
are preferable methods to control unruly inmates but public health 
and law enforcement officials say it makes little sense to give an 
irrational or mentally disturbed person the right to veto sensible 
medical practices 
courts in several states have ruled that mental patients who are 
legally competent have a right to refuse antipsychotic drugs 
but according to some studies judges in those states almost 
always decide that antipsychotic drugs may be administered against 
the individuals will after holding hearings in individual cases

a report by the agriculture department says 
the 1990 wheat program included a great deal of flexibility the 
latest farm policy watchword in the bush administration 
the economic research service report also noted that winter 
wheat farmers accept the idea too well 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced in september 
that farmers participating in the 1990 wheat program could plant up 
to 105 percent of their wheat base the goal was to produce more 
wheat this year 
but for every acre planted in excess of 95 percent of the base 
the acreage used to compute deficiency payments would be 
reduced by one acre 
despite the leeway farmers boosted winter wheat plantings last 
fall by only 3 percent from a year earlier in kansas the major 
producer there was no increase 
farmers may have been reluctant to lose deficiency payments or 
acreage in fallow rotation or their plantable area may have been 
constrained by the amount of wheat base they had idled under the 
conservation reserve program the report said much of the crp 
land in kansas is wheat base 
the report included in the march issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said dry soil conditions may have held down plantings in 
some areas also farmers may have learned about the 1990 program 
changes too late to alter their plans 
in any case the relatively small wheat response to the 105 
percent offer should not be taken as an indication that farmers 
would not respond to more if the administrations new proposal were 
adopted the report said the 105 percent provision is just a 
small part of the new flexibility 
for example it said corn farmers in indiana this year could 
not plant wheat on corn base and still collect deficiency payments 
they could under the new flexibility proposal 
a farmer with 100 acres of corn base 100 acres of wheat base 
and 100 acres of a new oilseed base would set aside 20 acres of 
wheat and corn land if there was a 10 percent acreage reduction 
program requirement or arp 
one the remaining 280 acres the farmer could grow any program 
or oilseed crop and still collect deficiency payments as if the 
permitted base acres had been planted to wheat and corn the 
report said and base history which is used to calculate future 
eligibility for benefits would be unaffected 
further any conservinguse crop such as clover or alfalfa could 
be grown on program cropland without loss of deficiency payments 
so long as it was not harvested also farmers could grow certain 
nonprogram alternative crops on base acres but would give up 
deficiency payments for those acres 
producers would be able to grow and harvest the program crop 
conserving crops and industrial crops on the arp acreage as well 
but would forgo deficiency payments on an acreforacre basis 
the report said 
the article written by economists greg gajewski and ed allen 
said some farmers could face more challenges if the 
administrations proposals are accepted by congress 
for example some soybean farmers who lacked wheat feed 
grain rice or cotton base might experience stiffer competition as 
more producers switched to soybeans in years when soybean prospects 
appeared especially bright the report said the competition 
would result because there is no target price and deficiency 
mechanism for soybeans and none is being proposed 
however it added some traditional soybean growers might switch 
to other crops in relatively tight supply and expect a reasonable 
return from them

a government report says widespread snow and 
rain over large areas of the great plains have brightened the 
outlook for wheat farmers 
moisture improved winter wheat growth in the central and 
southern great plains during the week of feb 1925 the joint 
agricultural weather facility said tuesday the northern great 
plains remained dry 
the facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and 
commerce weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but do 
not include production forecasts 
looking at other crops the report said rain again slowed field 
work in the delta and southeast corn planting began in southwest 
georgia and continued in florida and texas 
rain fell in all of floridas citrus areas and new growth was 
reported abundant and trees were blooming in all areas 
cold temperatures may have damaged peaches in northern georgia 
and portions of tennessee the report said peaches were 
blooming in texas and cold temperatures may have damaged peaches 
in the cross timbers area 
in california early varieties of apricots plums nectarines 
and peaches were blooming but frost damage was reported to early 
peaches and table grapes in riverside county

the value of us agricultural exports is 
forecast at 385 billion this year up 500 million from prospects 
last fall according to an analysis by the agriculture department 
but the new forecast for the fiscal year that began oct 1 still 
represents a 3 percent decline from an eightyear high of 397 
billion in 1989 the record was 438 billion in 1981 
the upward revision from november largely reflected a 3 
million ton increase in expected us coarse grain exports the 
report said tuesday prospects for foreign coarse grain imports 
have increased and us corn is expected to capture a larger 
share 
overall fiscal 1990 exports are forecast at 1485 million 
metric tons up 3 million tons from november and nearly 2 million 
tons more then in 1989 
the decline in value was blamed on lower prices for grains and 
oilseeds which more than offset the larger export volume 
estimates of agricultural imports were raised 500 million to 
215 billion matching last years record 
decembers severe freeze in florida and texas has increased 
prospects for fruit juice and vegetable imports the report said

researchers will show the marx brothers 
the three stooges wc fields and i love lucy to ailing 
nursing home residents to test the theory that tickling the funny 
bone can be therapeutic 
researchers will show about 150 nursing home residents comic 
films and tv programs to see if humor can reduce requests for 
nonprescription pain medicine fran mcguire a clemson university 
researcher said this week 
if this kind of thing is true it would be a tremendous tool 
for activity directors in nursing homes and other group settings 
said mcguire 
a smaller study by clemson two years ago indicated what appeared 
to be dramatic decreases in requests for drugs he said that could 
have been the result of chemical changes in the body or the result 
of reduced stress 
that study found that later comedies didnt do the trick said 
rosangela boyd who showed the films at a nursing home as part of 
the earlier study 
they did not find modern comedies such as three men and a 
baby to be funny nor did they like any of the films with 
offensive language she said

the white house is doing everything possible 
to win freedom for the eight american hostages in lebanon but a 
spokesman says theres no evidence to suggest their release will 
come soon 
we are pursuing every lead pursuing every contact 
talking to everybody we can presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said tuesday 
however fitzwater denied a report that the united states and 
iran had held secret talks on the hostages in geneva 
there are no direct talks between iran and the united states 
authorized by the president he said in response to a report in 
the londonbased lebanese newspaper al hayat we have no 
information on any special missions to geneva of the kind thats 
reported here 
there are a lot of people around the world talking about 
release of the hostages in lebanon involving americans and 
people from other countries at all levels he said 
i will never rule out meetings anywhere anyplace any time by 
anybody on the hostage question because there are meetings 
happening but high level us officials direct secret talks no 
do i expect a breakthrough or anything new happening no 
fitzwater said 
alhayat reported that sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah a key 
lebanese shiite moslem cleric said contacts occurred between iran 
and the united states through third parties 
fadlallah is the spiritual leader of the iranaligned hezbollah 
group some western hostages are believed held by factions linked 
to hezbollah 
fitzwater said recent comments by iranian president ali akbar 
hashemi rafsanjani and fadlallah as well as peggy says meeting 
with palestinian liberation organization chairman yasser arafat

hostages

hope 
mrs say is the sister of terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press and the longest held hostage 
he was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985

airliner brakes cant handle highenergy 
aborted takeoffs as they wear thin even though they meet federal 
certification standards the national transportation safety board 
says 
blaming inadequate certification by the federal aviation 
administration for the may 21 aborted takeoff of an american 
airlines dc10 at dallasfort worth airport the safety board 
called tuesday for airlines to reevaluate the capacity of their 
brakes when they begin to wear out 
board member jim burnett said the problem could be costly for 
the aviation industry because without new brake designs it might 
involve reducing the capacity of airliners the distance they could 
fly or the length of runways 
the american jetliner skidded more than 1000 feet off the end 
of the runway injuring eight of its 254 occupants the plane was 
too severely damaged to repair 
it was the first time the board had cited faa certification of 
an airliner model as the probable cause in a crash burnett said 
we have already lost an airliner and we face the real 
possibility of losing a planeful of people he said after the 
fourmember panel approved a series of recommendations to the faa 
and airlines for testing the capacity of brakes when they are worn 
the board raised doubts about faa certification and test 
procedures for all airliner brakes which it said may fail when 
planes abort takeoffs at high speed 
the dallas plane scheduled to fly to frankfurt west germany 
reached 178 miles per hour before the pilot reversed engine thrust 
and applied the brakes the brakes failed before the plane reached 
the end of the runway 
the ntsb also blamed the brake manufacturer loral in the 
aborted takeoff 
board members said brakes near their wear limit dont have the 
same margin of safety as new ones and the faa didnt consider that 
when it certified the brakes on the dc10 two decades ago 
airlines have about 3000 rejected takeoffs each year but most 
are executed at a low enough speed that braking power combined 
with reverse engine thrust is adequate to stop the plane without 
damage 
but an average of about four highpowered rejections result in 
accidents each year board members said 
investigators testified that only the newest brakes are adequate 
to safely stop an airliner that has to abort a takeoff near 
v1 the velocity at which the plane ordinarily must continue 
its take off the american plane was near that speed when a warning 
light and audible signal indicated a wingslat problem 
the signal proved to be false but the board did not fault the 
pilot for aborting the takeoff 
in a separate action the board recommended that the dc10s 
warning system on wing slat deployment be redesigned so it wont go 
off so late in the takeoff investigators said planes are easily 
able to fly even when slats are in the worst position while a 
highpowered aborted takeoff can be dangerous

the arrest of opposition sen juan 
ponce enrile on charges of supporting the bloody december coup 
attempt was aimed at projecting an image of toughness in a 
government long criticized as weak 
but fancy legal footwork raises doubt about government motives 
enrile a former defense minister and one of president corazon 
aquinos most outspoken critics was arrested tuesday after he and 
six others were indicted for allegedly supporting the dec 19 
failed coup in which at least 113 people were killed and more than 
600 wounded 
the 66yearold senator was the most prominent figure arrested 
in any of the six armed attempts to oust mrs aquino since she took 
power in the february 1986 people power uprising against 
ferdinand marcos 
after previous coup attempts the government was criticized for 
weakness because of lenient treatment of mutineers although dozens 
of officers have been convicted in coup attempts most enlisted 
participants are simply reassigned to different units 
in a radio interview today presidential press secretary tomas 
gomez acknowledged that the government felt under pressure to take 
decisive action in order to restore confidence among foreign 
investors 
our friends abroad are beginning to shy away gomez said 
they are scared because they mutineers have created a 
perception of instability that this government has very weak 
knees 
in moving against enrile the government stretched existing 
statutes to charge him with as serious an offense as possible 
enrile was charged with rebellion with murder under the 
charge which carries a life sentence no bail is allowed 
according to documents released so far the governments case is 
based on statements by witnesses who claimed they saw enrile with 
mutineers the first two days of the coup attempt prosecutors claim 
that proves enrile supported the mutiny 
legal sources not involved in the case say enrile should have 
been charged only with rebellion a lesser offense that carries 
six to 12 years imprisonment and allows bail 
the sources cite a 1956 supreme court decision that ruled 
offenses such as murder committed in connection with an uprising 
should be lumped together as rebellion 
gomez said the government would ask the court to reconsider that 
decision and approve charges of rebellion with murder in the enrile 
case 
he said the department of justice has begun a legal crusade 
to request the supreme court that it is now time to review the 
existing jurisprudence he said remember that there are forces 
led by mr enrile who would like to destroy the democracy of ours 
during martial law marcos overturned the 1956 court decision 
and authorized lumping rebellion and murder but mrs aquino 
canceled marcos decree in june 1987 as repressive 
the governments handling of the filing of charges showed the 
political sensitivity of the case justice officials leaked word of 
the charges on monday then announced they would be filed in a 
regional court in suburban makati 
enriles lawyers and reporters rushed there early tuesday but 
government prosecutors said they were waiting for some 
documents before filing the complaint 
but the only charge filed against enrile in makati was harboring 
a fugitive a relatively minor offense the more serious rebellion 
with murder charge was filed quietly in another court in what 
government sources said was a calculated ruse to throw enriles 
lawyers off guard 
the moves have created the impression among some filipinos that 
the government is interested primarily in nailing enrile gomez 
denied there was any vendetta but added how can one be 
vindictive to a person who is also perceived to be a criminal 
enrile is among the most controversial figures here because of 
his long involvement with the most odious aspects of the marcos 
government as marcos defense minister enrile ordered the arrest 
of thousands including mrs aquinos late husband benigno jr 
during the eight years of martial law 
later enrile broke with marcos and led the february 1986 
military mutiny that triggered the people power uprising mrs 
aquino retained him as defense minister but fired him nine months 
later after a failed coup by his followers 
since then neither mrs aquino nor enrile have made any secret 
of their mutual loathing enrile has accused mrs aquino of 
corruption and incompetence last week he publicly apologized 
for helping install her in power 
on sunday during a speech marking her fourth year in office 
mrs aquino repeatedly accused enrile of seeking to restore 
dictatorship adding mr enrile have you no shame 
blame it on the timing but people are bound to doubt if the 
rebellion charges with murder filed yesterday against enrile 
indeed show the effective operation of our criminal justice 
system or is simply political vengeance at its worst the 
independent daily malaya said

two highranking angolans are meeting with 
us officials this week amid conflicting reports about the 
military situation in the african country 
minister of justice fernando van dunem and gen roberto 
monteirongongo deputy chief of staff of the angolan military said 
they had tried to explain why their government launched a military 
offensive earlier this year 
peace prospects have deteriorated recently because of the 
intense fighting between the sovietbacked government of president 
jose eduardo dos santos and the usbacked unita rebels of jonas 
savimbi 
everybody is tired of war van dunem said in an interview 
tuesday we have never had a single day of peace 
the state department and sens dennis deconcini dariz and 
bob dole rkan have criticized the dos santos government for its 
military activities 
little attention has been paid in recent months to what may 
become a largescale slaughter deconcini said earlier this 
month condemning the dos santos governments military offensive in 
southern africa 
jardo muekalia savimbis representative in washington accused 
the angolan government of derailing the peace process with its 
military activity under a 1989 agreement zairian president seko 
sese mobutu was supposed to mediate between the two sides to form a 
national reconciliation 
the angolan officials met with assistant secretary of state 
herman cohen and members of congress to clarify the dos santos 
governments position 
any military action is simply retaliation for savimbi they 
said the government had to react show our ability to keep 
law and order van dunem said 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house africa 
subcommittee said he met with the angolans but did not have a 
clear picture of what was happening in angola 
my sense is that there has been more military activity he 
said our interest is to get people back to the negotiating 
table 
recent fighting has centered around mavinga 700 miles southeast 
of the capital of luanda 
an airstrip at mavinga and a nearby rebel base block the 
government forces way to rebel headquarters at jamba more than 120 
miles farther south 
van dunem and monteirongongo said the government controlled 
mavinga where mopping up operations were under way they also said 
the government had bombed jamba on saturday 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said fighting continues around mavinga but its not clear if 
either controls the entire mavinga the official could not 
confirm that jamba had been bombed 
muekalia denied that jamba had been bombed but said the 
government had conducted carpet bombings in the country against 
unita

a grand jury has a new twist in the stuart 
shooting case a 10yearold boy testified he heard a shot and saw 
a tall black man fleeing from the stuarts car the night of the 
shooting news reports said 
the boston herald and wbztv quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the boy along with a teacher and a teachers aide from a 
specialeducation primary school the boy attended testified before 
the suffolk county grand jury monday 
the unidentified boy lives on the street in the mission hill 
district where charles and carol stuart were found wounded in their 
car oct 23 
stuart called police on his car phone and directed them to where 
he and his wife had been shot stuart said he and his pregnant wife 
were shot by a black man who got in their car and robbed them after 
they left a hospital birthing class 
mrs stuart died hours after she was shot her child delivered 
prematurely died 17 days later 
a black man william bennett reportedly was considered the 
leading suspect in the shootings until stuart was implicated by his 
brother matthew on jan 3 the next day charles stuart apparently 
jumped to his death from a bridge 
district attorney newman flanagan then said bennett who had 
been arrested on an unrelated charge no longer was considered a 
suspect 
the police manhunt for a black man and the subsequent revelation 
that stuart may have been the real culprit prompted outrage in 
mission hill and charges of racism from civil rights leaders 
the 10yearold apparently told his teachers what he had heard 
and seen shortly after the shootings but prosecutors were not told 
until recently the herald said

serious criminal fraud is three times as 
likely to occur at a failed savings and loan than at an insolvent 
commercial bank according to a top regulator 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman who 
also serves as head of a new sampl bailout agency the resolution 
trust corp said about 60 percent of the thrifts seized by the 
government over the past year have been victimized by serious 
criminal activity 
in commercial banks criminal fraud is present in 17 percent to 
20 percent of failures he told the house ways and means oversight 
subcommittee tuesday 
if you can think of a kind of fraud well be able to show you 
an example in the sampls he said 
however a justice department official warned the panel not to 
expect speedy recovery of taxpayers losses on thrifts even though 
the administration is spending 49 million this year on 202 fbi 
agents and 30 trial lawyers to go after embezzlers 
the investigation and prosecution of major financial 
institution fraud typically will require many months or 
years said mark m richard deputy assistant attorney general 
moreover much of the money is gone the value of assets 
involved in the fraud often has plummeted and the defendant may 
have squandered his or her own assets leaving little or nothing to 
recover he said 
to speed the process richard said the justice department 
intends in some cases to seek civil fraud penalties which require 
less proof than a criminal conviction 
meanwhile seidman defended his agency from criticism that its 
not moving fast enough 
the panel chairman rep jj pickle dtexas called the rtcs 
progress damnably slow and hesitant 
although the government over the past year has taken control of 
382 insolvent thrifts with 192 billion in assets it has been less 
successful in returning the institutions to new private owners so 
far its sold only 49 thrifts and in most cases has had to keep 
most of the assets 
but seidman said the rtc has had littlerecognized success in 
selling assets from thrifts before they are sold or liquidated all 
told in 1989 the agency sold assets or collected bad loans 
totaling about 25 billion he said 
separately another bailout official announced a change in 
policy aimed at speeding the sale of bankrupt institutions 
william taylor acting chief staff officer of the rtc oversight 
board said tuesday that thrift buyers in many cases now will get 
up to a year to return loans real estate and other assets to the 
government 
the previous limit of six months may have discouraged bids from 
some potential buyers who maintained they needed more time to 
evaluate large complex asset portfolios he told the national 
council of savings institutions 
the oversight board is the treasury departmentled panel 
controlling the policy and funding of seidmans agency rep bruce 
vento dminn introduced legislation tuesday to abolish the 
oversight board calling it a shackle around the neck of those 
trying to solve the sampl crisis 
in another development a senior official of the office of 
thrift supervision resigned tuesday 
karl t hoyle the senior deputy director in charge of 
congressional and media relations left to form his own lobbying 
company 
he is the second top thrift office official to leave in less 
than a week and his departure leaves three of the agencys top 
eight spots vacant last friday jordan luke chief counsel of the 
agency said he was entering private law practice 
thrift office director m danny wall under fire from congress 
resigned dec 4 but continues to serve the treasury department has 
been unable to find a replacement

a governmentendorsed report recommends an 
ambitious effort by food companies physicians and individuals to 
improve health by reducing fat and cholesterol in the national diet 
the result says the expert panel that produced the report 
would be a 20 percent reduction in coronary heart disease 
the american public should have a greater range of 
lowsaturated fatty acid lowfat and lowcholesterol food options 
available and they should have the information to establish 
hearthealthy eating patterns said james cleeman coordinator of 
the national cholesterol education program 
the ncep report endorsed by government agencies and 26 health 
and professional groups includes recommendations ranging from 
nutrient consumption to standardized food labeling to educational 
programs 
heart disease is the nations no 1 killer disease claiming the 
lives of about 500000 americans each year it is associated with 
high levels of cholesterol in the blood which clogs arteries 
the panel recommended a twopronged approach the first of which 
seeks to identify and treat people at high risk of heart disease 
with dietary therapy and possibly medication those people 
generally have blood cholesterol levels of more than 240 milligrams 
per deciliter 
but more than 60 percent of the disabilities and premature 
deaths associated with heart disease occur in millions of americans 
whose cholesterol levels are below that level the report said 
these people as well as all americans over age 2 would benefit 
from the second part of the strategy aimed at lowering cholesterol 
levels by promoting healthful food choices and making food lower in 
saturated fat and cholesterol more widely available 
of greatest importance in the diet the report said is 
saturated fat from animal and vegetable sources saturated fats are 
more important to overall blood cholesterol levels than the amount 
of cholesterol consumed 
claims that foods with no cholesterol are healthier are 
misleading because the food may contain high amounts of saturated 
fat said dr richard carleton head of the population panel of the 
national cholesterol education program 
he said no food is a magic bullet for lowering cholesterol 
and that eliminating a single food such as egg yolks which have a 
high cholesterol content is also not a solution 
the report calls on the food industry to promote label and 
distribute goodtasting safe foods lower in fat and cholesterol 
and high in complex carbohydrates including soluble fiber 
it says the government should expand and standardize food 
labeling requirements so consumers can have more information the 
food and drug administration is drafting new foodlabeling 
regulations and legislation is pending in congress 
other recommendations call on health professionals to advocate 
healthier diets for educational programs and continued nutrition 
research 
if the recommendations are heeded large numbers of americans 
will be at lower risk of coronary heart disease carleton said 
on nutrients the panel recommends the same intake averages as 
recommended by the american heart association and the national 
research council they include less than 10 percent of total 
calories from saturated fat an average of 30 percent of total 
calories or less from all fat and less than 300 milligrams of 
cholesterol per day 
the report was endorsed by the ncep coordinating committee 
which includes the department of health and human services the 
department of agriculture and other government agencies as well as 
professional groups such as the american medical association the 
american heart association and the american public health 
association

a judge may sentence a dead man to prison 
this week not out of any sense of moral outrage but as a way of 
enabling the defendants lawyer to recover the 30000 bail he put 
up for his client 
before santiago alfred gallegos was killed while awaiting 
resentencing for sexually abusing a child morris collins put up 
the money with the promise of producing his client in court 
gallegos of course never showed 
so the game plan now appears to be to have a judge sentence 
gallegos on friday have defense attorneys ask for a new trial on 
the grounds that their client was not present for sentencing and 
then have the prosecutor dismiss the charge 
its one of those queer deals where there is no provision in 
the books for this said district judge phil chavarria jr he 
said however he is not convinced the law allows him to send a 
dead man to prison 
gallegos was convicted in 1986 and sentenced to eight years in 
prison the sentence was overturned on a technicality but the 
conviction was upheld on appeal in december gallegos 54 was 
found beaten to death in his home 
assistant district attorney ed shaughnessy said the judge cannot 
just dismiss the charge because the appellate courts have upheld 
the conviction 
on the other hand said harry nass gallegos current attorney 
collins shouldnt be out 30000 
i think youll find mr gallegos was hit over the head with 
blunt object i think it is a logical presumption that hes not 
voluntarily absent nass said

a collection of tax changes that president 
bush says would increase collections by 139 billion next year 
will in fact net only 94 billion congressional analysts say 
the projections by the nonpartisan congressional budget office 
if accurate would mean that bush would fall 45 billion short of 
his claim that his 1991 budget cuts next years federal deficit by 
375 billion 
elsewhere rep dan rostenkowski the houses top tax writer 
said tuesday he believes congress wont be able to boost next 
years tax collections by the 139 billion bush wants 
the cbo projections obtained by the associated press showed that 
bushs 40 tax proposals would reap 13 billion in additional 
receipts between 1991 and 1993 bushs fiscal 1991 budget released 
last month estimated that his proposed levy changes would bring 
294 billion into government coffers during that threeyear period 
in addition cbo estimated that bushs proposed changes would 
actually cost the government 400 million in 1993 because he has 
proposed creating socalled family savings accounts that would 
offer tax breaks and offering a series of tax advantages to 
companies that conduct research 
there were two chief differences between bushs estimates and 
the cbos projections for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
bush claimed he would save 25 billion next year by making 
unspecified improvements in the internal revenue services 
efficiency cbo said no savings would result 
second bush projected new collections of 49 billion next year 
by cutting the tax rate on capital gains a move he argues would 
stimulate sales real estate and other property capital gains are 
profits on the sales of those holdings 
cbo estimated that the reduction would reap the government 32 
billion next year in addition the congressional analysts said the 
rate cut would lose from 31 billion to 43 billion for each of 
the next four years the bush administration has argued that the 
cut would bring in money to the treasury each year 
the grammrudman balancedbudget law requires the use of white 
house estimates of revenues and spending in determining the federal 
deficit cbos figures are respected by many lawmakers for their 
objectivity and accuracy and are used as a benchmark to judge the 
administrations numbers 
meanwhile rostenkowskis pessimism about the ability of 
lawmakers to raise 139 billion in taxes makes it seem even less 
likely that bush and congress will have an easy time of agreeing to 
a budget for next year 
the illinois democrat said that if his committee is told to find 
14 billion in new taxes were just not that good a magician 
unless we become very serious about reaching out for revenues that 
are certainly going to be ducks 
the word ducks was a reference to budget director richard 
darmans statement last year that bushs pledge of no new taxes 
applies to any levies the public would perceive as taxes he used 
the expression that if something walks and talks like a duck its 
a duck 
bush has repeatedly promised to veto increases in such taxes 
congress democratic leaders have said they will propose no tax 
increases that will provoke a veto and leave their party as the 
sole advocate of higher taxes

president bush must face the likely 
consequences of massive military layoffs because he favored weapons 
over people the chairman of the house armed services committee 
says 
putting weapons before people was their decision and now 
theyre stuck with it rep les aspin dwis said tuesday in 
response to pentagon outrage over congressional refusal to consider 
a shift in defense funds 
the defense department requested the authority to move 852 
million from other accounts to personnel to avoid the dismissal of 
tens of thousands of men and women by october the cuts are 
required under the grammrudman budget cutting law 
but aspin with the backing of house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash declined to bring the request up before his committee 
informing the service chiefs and his committee colleagues in 
separate letters dated monday 
such reprogrammings of funds must be approved by each of the 
house and senate armed services committees and the house and senate 
appropriations committees 
if we dont stand firm now this administration will have us 
playing chicken with the budget every year distorting the 
deficit reduction process and relying on us to save it from its 
more irresponsible excesses aspin said in a memorandum to his 
committee members 
bush had the option of exempting military personnel from the 
grammrudman law 
aspin said his committee is rejecting the budget shell game 
that bush and white house budget chief richard darman are playing 
with the military personnel account 
but pentagon officials lashed out at the congressional inaction 
charging that it will have an absolutely devastating effect on 
military personnel 
the pentagon estimates that without the reprogramming authority 
44100 to 68200 military personnel would have to be fired by oct 
1 between 32500 and 32600 people would be frozen in their 
current jobs 57000 to 67000 promotions would be delayed and 
59900 to 115900 fewer men and women could be brought into the 
armed forces 
there are about 21 million men and women in uniform 
pentagon spokesman pete williams argued that defense secretary 
dick cheney was directed by congress in the fiscal 1990 defense 
spending bill to request approval of the transfer 
williams quoted the bill as saying the request should be made 
to prevent a return to the 1970s phenomenon of the hollow army 
in which many units were substantially undermanned 
williams said the pentagon has been preparing dramatic 
decreases in force size to be executed judiciously over a period 
of years 
you dont simply reach in and yank out a certain number of 
people in the force he said 
christopher jehn assistant secretary of defense for force 
management and personnel told the house armed services 
subcommittee on military personnel and compensation that failure of 
congress to agree to shift funds would be a disaster 
the director of the congressional budget office called before 
the subcommittee to testify about reshaping the military said the 
defense department should be able to handle a quick reduction in 
forces 
its doable but extremely difficult said robert d 
reischauer 
the hearing focused on five alternative plans to restructure 
us military forces in light of the dramatic changes in eastern 
europe and the possibility of a ussoviet agreement to reduce 
strategic arms and conventional forces 
the cbo alternatives would reduce the annual defense budget by 
between 9 billion and 80 billion with cuts in active duty 
manpower ranging from about 100000 to almost 600000

senate democratic whip alan cranston citing 
his own tarnished image from the keating five scandal is 
encouraging his colleagues to revive public financing as a campaign 
reform issue 
so long as our elected representatives must depend on private 
contributions to be viable candidates our political system will be 
suspect the california lawmaker told the senate rules committee 
the panel in a damagecontrol effort by both parties to the 
growing public perception that congress can be bought is scheduled 
to begin writing a campaign reform bill next week 
cranstons colleagues were courteous tuesday but his proposal 
for using payroll taxwithholding system to collect 1amonth 
voluntary contributions as an alternative to private campaign 
financing is expected to get scant attention 
sen wendell ford the panel chairman said he expected few if 
any changes to a bill that would set voluntary spending 
ceilings using discount mail and television rates rather than 
public campaign dollars as an incentive for compliance 
cranstons name was linked last fall with influencepeddling on 
behalf of savings and loan operator charles h keating jr 
ford a kentucky democrat said then that he would run against 
cranston for the whips post after novembers election however 
the race for the no 2 party post in the senate never came up in 
tuesdays hearing 
instead ford and fellow kentuckian mitch mcconnell a leading 
senate republican on the campaign reform issue patiently listened 
as cranston critiqued the present systems reliance on wealthy 
contributors and political action committees 
no matter how ethical we are no matter how carefully we 
evaluate our activities on our constituents behalf our dependence 
on campaign fundraising from private sources casts a shadow on the 
ethics of us all cranston said 
so long as any wealthy contributor benefits from any action a 
senator takes that senator can be accused of selling out he 
said the only way to lift that shadow is to end our 
dependence on private sources of campaign funds 
cranston is one of five senators under investigation by the 
senate ethics committee on charges they took a total of 13 
million in campaign gifts raised by keating and then interceded in 
1987 with federal thrift regulators 
the other four senators are john glenn dohio donald riegle 
dmich john mccain rariz and dennis deconcini dariz 
at the time regulators were moving against the phoenix 
millionaires lincoln savings and loan association of irvine 
calif which was taken over by the government in april 
regulators estimate that lincolns losses of federally insured 
deposits to risky land investments and allegedly fraudulent loans 
will ultimately cost taxpayers up to 2 billion

the us government is faltering as japan and 
other countries work to make their manufacturers competitive a 
congressional advisory agency said today 
american manufacturing has never been in more trouble than it 
is now the office of technology assessment said in a 231page 
report prepared for the senate banking committee 
the report rekindles a twodecadeold debate over industrial 
policy and the governments role in private enterprise with the 
agency clearly siding with those favoring greater federal 
participation 
with few exceptions the us government has been reluctant to 
adopt proactive policies to build competitiveness it said 
the time is ripe for reopening the question before industry 
is so weakened that national security is threatened 
agency advisers suggested establishing a civilian technology 
agency through the national institute of standards and technology 
unless us industry and government take coordinated and 
timely action there will be a longterm deterioration of our 
industrial strength and military security and an erosion of our 
economic health they said 
the report acknowledged that selective government support of key 
technologies or industries amounts to picking winners and that 
government bureaucrats often are illequipped to make such choices 
as an example it cited the hundreds of millions of dollars the 
nowdefunct synfuels corp spent in the early 1980s subsidizing 
coal and shalebased substitutes for oil and natural gas 
but it said joint japanese governmentindustry efforts have not 
always enjoyed success 
among the japanese failures cited were attempts at jumpstarting 
biotechnology development building a fifth generation of computers 
and erecting a civilian airliner industry 
the dominance of us civilian aircraft manufacturers in world 
markets can be attributed to governmentsupported research on 
airframe and engine technologies in the early part of the century 
the report said 
a lesson is that a crisis is a poor crucible for making such 
decisions it said the failure of the synfuels project can be 
traced largely to the atmosphere of crisis in which it was born 
the advisers also cited government support of agricultural 
technology development through land grant universities and 
cooperative extension services as being a key to the rapid 
productivity growth of american farms 
it is possible to take the best from the picking winners 
debate and develop institutions for government collaboration with 
manufacturers without becoming captive to them the report said 
the argument cannot and should not be resolved by counting up 
successes and failures any sustained effort will include some 
failures and some industries might succeed more in spite of 
government support than because of it

riding a 700foot geyser of fire 
shuttle atlantis set the night ablaze in a dazzling soundandlight 
show as it rocketed into orbit early wednesday on a secret mission 
to put a spy satellite in orbit 
after five postponements the 100ton spaceship thundered into a 
clear sky at 251 am and darted out over the atlantic ocean 
eight minutes and 40 seconds later mission control center in 
houston reported atlantis was in a secure orbit 
the flight engineer reports the main engine cutoff was 
nominal mission control reported as the spacecraft soared into 
orbit more than 100 miles high 
once atlantis reached orbit nasa and the pentagon placed a news 
blackout on the progress of the flight unless there was a major 
problem only two announcements were planned one about three hours 
after liftoff that orbital operations had begun and another 30 
hours into the flight with the date and time of landing 
atlantis and its crew of five military officers headed on a 
northeast course skirting the east coast 
officials said earlier that if skies were clear the fiery 
liftoff might be visible for hundreds of miles and that residents 
as far north as new jersey might see the rising shuttle as a 
shooting star 
only three of the previous 33 shuttle missions began in darkness 
the shuttles course and launch time were determined by the need 
to place a photoreconnaissance satellite into position to observe 
military bases and missile bases in northern regions of the soviet 
union 
because the mission is classified nasa and the pentagon blacked 
out the status of the countdown until the clock ticked down to nine 
minutes 
two minutes into the flight the two solidfuel rockets burned 
out and fell away atlantis continuing its climb into space on the 
thrust of its three main liquidfuel engines 
the sixth delay tied the record for launch postponements by two 
earlier shuttle missions 
the launch had been delayed five times by bad weather a cold 
that felled atlantis commander navy capt john o creighton and a 
faulty computer that halted the count sunday just 31 seconds before 
liftoff 
despite a forecast of high winds shuttle managers gave the 
goahead again tuesday to proceed with the countdown and workers 
pumped 528000 pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the 
shuttles external fuel tank 
but the winds abated as the countdown advanced and atlantis 
safely cleared the pad on blastoff 
low clouds and gusty winds early monday caused the national 
aeronautics and space administration to postpone the flight for the 
fifth time shuttle managers then decided to put off for 48 hours 
another attempt so that the astronauts and launch team could rest 
the records for launch postponements were in 1986 columbia 
lifted off jan 12 after six delays caused by weather and 
mechanical problems challengers doomed launch on jan 28 came 
after six delays three as a result of the columbia postponements 
and three during countdowns 
atlantis was delayed twice because of weather and creightons 
sore throat and nasal congestion weather alone caused two other 
delays and a failed computer was blamed for one more delay the 
first attempt was last thursday 
the shuttle was expected to fly northeastward a few hundred 
miles off the east coast if the weather were clear the launch 
could be visible for hundreds of miles as far north as new jersey 
atlantis launch path would put it in an orbit that reportedly 
would cover a greater area of the globe than any other shuttle so 
that its photoreconnaissance satellite once released by the crew 
could gather intelligence over northern areas of the soviet union 
where there are numerous military bases and missile sites 
the purpose of the fourday mission is secret but sources close 
to the project have said the astronauts were to deploy a 
37300pound 500 million satellite capable of taking supersharp 
photos and eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications 
around the world 
in covering most of the soviet union the satellite would be 
important in verifying soviet compliance with arms control 
agreements

former surgeon general c everett koop is 
criticizing congress and his former employer for failing to come up 
with a federal policy to deal with aids 
there are ample opportunities for the white house and 
congress to develop an aids policy koop told a house panel 
tuesday i think its almost 10 years overdue 
my concerns this morning have yet to be addressed at a 
national level said koop he said later it seems incredible 
that the federal government has not had a dialogue with state and 
local governments and insurers 
rep henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the health and 
environment subcommittee faulted president bush for failing to act 
on groundwork laid when koop was surgeon general under president 
reagan 
having missed the opportunity to get the ounce of prevention 
we now have to pay for the pounds and pounds of cure said 
waxman who was hearing testimony on his proposed legislation to 
expand medicaid coverage for people with aids or infected with the

a private study says the nations major 
jobtraining program is not working the way it was intended with 
those who are least in need getting most of the help as americans 
who are troubled and discouraged are weeded out 
the report published by the economic policy institute a 
unionbacked think tank said private contractors participating in 
the job training partnership act are creamskimming or picking 
promising candidates with skills over welfare recipients and high 
school dropouts 
but a labor department official said tuesday that the report 
written by john donahue of harvard universitys john f kennedy 
school of government sounds like its getting a little too 
carried away 
we need to keep in mind that jtpa has been extremely 
successful said roberts t jones assistant secretary for 
employment and training he said 97 percent of those served are 
defined by law as economically disadvantaged 
donahues report suggested that jtpa is merely finding jobs 
for workers who already are the bestequipped and most desirable to 
employers rather than actually helping people develop longterm

federal election commission figures show 
political action committees raised 171 million last year and spent 
132 million with the teamsters union pac retaining its place as 
the top pac in both fundraising and spending 
the fec said in its analysis that the overall levels pac 
fundraising and spending were little changed from the two years 
ago but that contributions from pacs to federal candidates 
political parties and related election committees rose 24 percent 
to 69 million last year compared to 56 million in 1987 
some of that increase can be attributed to the eight special 
elections last year to fill congressional seats an unusually high 
number the fec said some of the increase also likely was 
attributable to efforts by candidates and political committees to 
retire 1988 campaign debts 
the 171 million raised by pacs last year compared to 166

prices on the tokyo stock exchange today kept up 
their strong recovery from mondays severe plunge while the dollar 
ended a sixday climb against the japanese yen after reaching an 
eightmonth high 
the 225issue nikkei stock average the stock markets leading 
indicator gained 69404 points or 204 percent closing at 
3459199 volume was a relatively heavy 700 million shares on the 
first section 
the gain followed a 57608point rise tuesday the day after the 
index fell 156910 points in its secondbiggest oneday plunge 
ever and its worst since the october 1987 black monday global 
crash 
dealers said investors had regained confidence in the market 
after a series of declines that had trimmed 14 percent off the 
nikkeis value by monday 
the market is in the process of recovery declared kazuhiro 
nomura a dealer with new japan securities co 
allowing for stability in the bond market we are quite 
confident that the market found its lowest point yesterday at 
3244318 points on the nikkei average said yutaka nakai of 
daiwa securities co investors especially individual investors 
feel increasing confidence 
the recovery apparently didnt come fast enough for someone in 
osaka japans secondbiggest city windows at seven brokerages 
there were smashed overnight in what seemed to be an expression of 
outrage the national newspaper asahi shimbun reported 
meanwhile not everyone was convinced the market had bottomed 
out 
economist adrian tschoegl of sbci securities asia said he 
calculates the stock market should fall another 10 percent to reach 
a path of sustainable growth in line with its historical trend 
but theres no way to know if the market will drop 10 percent 
tomorrow or go sideways for six months he said 
nakai cautioned that the yendollar rate remained a threat to 
the stock market rally the yens recent weakness has been cited as 
one factor making stock investment unattractive 
the dollar closed today at 14852 yen down 051 yen from 
tuesdays close of 14903 yen it opened at 14864 yen and ranged 
from 14833 yen to 14889 yen 
in the preceding six trading days it had climbed a total of 
451 yen reaching its highest level since june 
today the dollar appeared stable at 148 yen but if the yen 
weakens to 151152 yen and japanese authorities cannot raise the 
official discount rate due to us pressure we do not see any 
resistance line beyond that until 160 yen nakai said 
the discount rate the interest charged by the central bank for 
loans to commercial banks affects other interest rates some 
analysts have expressed concern that higher interest rates in japan 
would draw funds back from the united states 
we expected that the stock market rally might drive the dollar 
below 148 yen said masafumi koyama chief dealer at the bank of 
tokyo but at 14830 yen there was a massive buy order that 
drove the dollar back up to 14860 it was quite a surprise 
koyama said japanese institutional investors were buying and 
selling dollars with equal fervor 
japanese government bonds which the finance ministry has 
struggled to bolster lately continued to weaken the yield on the 
benchmark no 119 issue climbed to 703 percent up from 691 
percent tuesday

the licentiousness of mardi gras gave way to 
the austerity of lent today as cleanup crews took back the streets 
from the partyers to scoop up the litter that will tell how 
successful the blowout was 
the crowds been unusually heavy but its been very 
peaceful said police capt george bourgeois of the french 
quarter where officers on horseback swept revelers off the street 
as midnight turned fat tuesday into ash wednesday 
the end of the party marked the first of 40 days of fasting and 
penitence with which many christians mark lent 
once streets are clear street cleaning trucks scoop up the vast 
amounts of litter left after a day of partying and parades the 
trash tonnage one of the measures of mardi gras success wont 
be known for a couple of days 
however capt paul titus said after a helicopter flight over 
the city that more than 1 million people were on the streets as in 
most previous years 
an additional 600000 to 700000 enjoyed tuesdays balmy weather 
in suburban metairie with thousands more in other suburbs and 
cities around southern louisiana celebrations in heavily roman 
catholic louisiana began jan 6 and went into high geae than a week 
before tuesdays climax which included 15 parades in new orleans 
and its suburbtightly packed crowd probably was at bourbon street 
as five women bared their breasts on different floors of one hotel 
every so often one would disappear apparently at the behest of 
hotel security and reappear at another window to lift her shirt n 
exchange for beads thrown from the crowd below the street bodies 
became so tightly jammed that it was impossible to move for 15 
minutes can you believe that said a woman who squeezed into 
the sho bar striptease club buying a drink so she could stay 
bourgeois said tuesdays only injury was to a french quarter 
officer whose knee was hurt when his horse slipped and fell on 
pavement slick from spilled booze 
parades in new orleans started with the club called zulu whose 
members blacks in blackface and grass skirts tossed painted 
coconuts and spears along with plastic beads and big aluminum 
spanishstyle doubloons next came the elegant procession of rex 
the king of carnival followed by 150 homebuilt floats 
its new orleans mission to see to it that everyone in the 
world has plastic beads plastic cups and rubber chickens the 
stuff they throw from the pa good but everyone wants it said 
rita miller of metairie 
many in the crowds dressed up as batman most of his imitators 
had the full cape tights and cowl but eric wrights minimalist 
approach a leather jockstrap with a plastic bat taped to it 
drew a crowd 
rick ward 21 of albuquerque said someone ran into his parked 
car and totaled it saturday and on previous days his wallet and 
stereo were swiped from the car but that didnt spoil his party 
mood 
i love it he said were going to move here all we have 
to do is fly home and get reservations to fly back

a nearly allwhite community voted to 
allow lights at its soccer field despite a racist flier warning 
that black youngsters from innercity oakland would be drawn to a 
park for night games 
measure a had divided this wealthy city even before about 50 of 
the fliers were placed on cars and homes sunday night 
but on tuesday voters overwhelmingly defeated the referendum 
which would have prohibited any new lighting at public playing 
fields in piedmont there were 2442 votes cast against the measure 
and 1421 votes in favor 
no one took responsibility for the fliers which said lighted 
fields could draw black disadvantaged innercity oakland 
youngsters many from single headofhousehold families and some 
from drug rehabilitation programs 
such youngsters the fliers said desperately need sports 
areas that are easily accessible and free of drugs and gang 
warfare 
a nonexistent group called blacks for no on a was named on 
the flier which listed 37 apparently phony names 
mayor susan hill who supported the measure said the fliers 
played on residents fears only 1 percent of piedmonts 10450 
residents are black 
i think its very discouraging and disappointing that someone 
would distribute this type of material she said i dont think 
that residents of piedmont would be swayed by this type of hate 
piece 
she added the truth is that piedmont is surrounded by 
oakland every newspaper shows the incredible crime rate and the 
burglaries most crimes are drugrelated its not a myth 
robert steinhorn a leader of the measure a campaign said the 
fliers were obviously a bunch of racist garbage intended to 
make his camp look bad 
the measure was placed on the ballot in response to plans by the 
city council to light a playing field until 8 pm for about six 
weeks each year for night practice sessions of a community soccer 
club 
neighbors said the plan would cause the values of their 300000 
homes to plummet

a federal judge has ruled that transportation 
workers who join unions have the same right as nonmembers to 
refuse to pay dues that would be used to promote political or 
ideological causes they oppose 
the decision tuesday by us district judge paul v niemeyer 
will make it easier for union members to demand rebates on their 
dues said attorney milton l chappell of the national right to 
work legal defense fund 
most unions have taken the position in the past that any right 
to pay a reduced fee only applies to nonmembers said chappell 
who brought the case on behalf of a greenbelt woman who belongs to 
the transportation communications international union 
niemeyer said that for the union to use her dues for political 
or ideological reasons violated her first amendment rights and the 
federal railway labor act 
niemeyer issued the ruling under the railway labor act which 
governs only the transportation industries but it could set a 
precedent for courts ruling on similar demands by other workers 
unhappy with their unions political activities 
other court decisions have held that nonunion members working 
in a union shop where all workers must join the labor 
organization could reject union assessments for activities not 
directly related to contract negotiations grievance procedures or 
other central functions 
mitchell m kraus general counsel for the transportation 
communications international union said the ruling was 
disappointing but he could not say whether the union which 
represents 100000 employees would appeal 
to my knowledge this is the first ruling of its kind kraus 
said 
the case was brought on behalf of kathryn a kidwell an amtrak 
secretary she objected to her dues being used for purposes 
unrelated to collective bargaining but said she did not want to 
quit the union 
in his decision niemeyer said kidwell was faced with the 
dilemma of staying in the union and having her money used for 
causes she opposes or leaving and giving up her right to vote on 
the terms and conditions of her employment 
in short she is given the option of protecting free speech 
or of protecting her vote on the continuation or conditions of 
work but not both the judge said 
he ordered the union to give kidwell and others similarly 
situated the right to receive a reduction in dues

divided by ideology and united by 
strong family ties the chamorro family now led by 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro sums up the 
complexity of nicaraguan political life 
mrs chamorro was a housewife from the conservative region of 
rivas in the traditional mold of the nicarguan upper middle class 
woman 
she went from housewife to newspaper publisher when her husband 
pedro joaquin chamorro was assassinated apparently by agents of 
dictator anastasio somoza on jan 10 1978 
the assassination turned chamorro into a martyr of the 
sandinista revolution which toppled somoza 19 months later on july 
19 1979 
mrs chamorro became a symbol of the revolution joining the 
junta that took over nine months later she quit 
pedro joaquin and violetas children are evenly split carlos 
fernando and claudia are militant sandinistas and government 
officials pedro joaquin and cristiana are bitterly antisandinista 
between them the chamorros run two of the three daily 
newspapers in town the opposition la prensa and the sandinista 
party paper barricada which split off from la prensa 
the chamorro children tear at each others throats in print but 
at family reunions politics end at the dinner table 
we are brothers and sisters with political differences we 
meet occasionally and we treat each other with respect said 
cristiana the youngest of the children at 30 and director of la 
prensa which her late father turned into a constant political 
critic of the late dictator somoza 
the family story became the center of attention again this week 
when mrs chamorro heading an opposition coalition of 14 political 
parties and other groups defeated president daniel ortegas bid 
for reelection appearing to put an end to sandinista rule 
the same differences of political opinion we had in 1979 are 
the differences we have now but we have affectionate family 
relations said carlos fernando who as director of barricada 
published articles that often ridiculed mrs chamorro during her 
presidential campaign 
yet the two embraced publicly as loving mother and son monday 
when ortega visited mrs chamorro to congratulate her on her 
electoral victory 
i have been a sandinista for a long time carlos fernando 
said 
a friend of the family speaking on condition of anonimity said 
of the chamorros 
they have one thing in common a conservative patrician sense 
of unity of the family above everything else after that the 
differences begin 
they are all children of pedro joaquin publisher guerrilla 
novelist and romantic whose constant attacks on somoza eventually 
brought him death on a street cornder in a hail of bullets 
many people like to speculate whether pedro joaquin would be on 
the sandinistas side were he alive today 
carlos fernando and pedro joaquin the younger studied in canada 
but carlos fernando was the only one allowed to work as a reporter 
at la prensa while pedro joaquin was alive 
carlos fernando inherited the social concerns and political 
traditions of his father said the friend of the family pedro 
joaquin inherited the business sense of the cardenal family on his 
paternal grandmothers side 
pedro joaquin eventually became director of la prensa when it 
was the target of government attacks in the early 80s 
pedro joaquin was really afraid of the revolution the 
friend added he and cristiana really identified themselves with 
the people opposed to the revolution la prensa then became a forum 
for those people 
claudia served as an ambassador for the sandinista government 
conservative or liberal they are fighters maybe pedro 
joaquin and cristiana are not the journalists that carlos fernando 
is and they cant write worth a darn but they were never afraid to 
say what they thought 
the paper was closed by the sandinista government several times 
when young pedro joaquin was the director 
the paper was closed for more than a year under international 
pressure ortega once visited mrs chamorro and told her she could 
publish but the government would have to have a censor at the 
newspaper 
then i wont publish said mrs chamorro a stubborn woman 
from a cattle region who once started a campaign speech when 
newspapers referred to her by her maiden name by saying 
i have on me the brand of the chamorros

the contra rebels are refusing to 
heed a call from nicaraguan leaders and the honduran president to 
disband immediately saying theyll wait until the newly elected 
government in managua takes office 
dismantling the usbacked force has emerged as a critical 
element in a peaceful transition in nicaragua following the 
oppositions stunning electoral triumph sunday over the leftist 
sandinistas 
on tuesday both sandinista president daniel ortega and the 
opposition presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro said the 
rebels must immediately disband 
the causes that started the civil war in nicaragua have 
disappeared mrs chamorro said in a radio broadcast tuesday 
night thats why those who took to the hills should now lay down 
their guns and return peacefully to nicaragua with their families 
to work for the reconstruction of our motherland 
earlier president rafael leonardo callejas of honduras said the 
contras must leave honduras as soon as possible 
but israel galeano the senior leader among the estimated 10000 
rebels in camps near nicaraguas northern border said they did not 
trust the sandinistas who control nicaraguas army and police 
our disbanding will take effect when the sandinistas turn over 
power galeano said meanwhile we will remain in honduras 
galeano said in a telephone interview that the rebels would 
remain in camps on the honduran side of the border waiting for 
there to be adequate conditions in nicaragua for our return 
they the sandinistas are capable of relinquishing the 
government but not power or weapons to the winners of last sundays 
election 
galeano spoke after the call by ortega to disband but before the 
similar urging by mrs chamorro and it was unclear whether her 
statement would affect the contras decision some members of her 
coalition are former contra leaders who returned to nicaragua under 
a government amnesty 
after a sixhour meeting of sandinista party leaders on tuesday 
ortega said the party would hand over power but defend the 
integrity and professionalism of the army and the police forces 
the sandinista national liberation front demands the immediate 
demobilization and disarming of the contras so there can be a 
peaceful transition he said reading from a statement by party 
leaders 
mrs chamorro is to take office for a sixyear term april 25 
about 10000 contra combatants retreated in march 1988 to 
yamales 120 miles southeast of tegucigalpa after the united 
states suspended military assistance and limited nonlethal aid 
since then they have been living in camps on the honduran side 
of the border with nicaragua some of them with their relatives 
in addition an unknown number of contras were in nicaragua 
right up to sundays election 
galeano said the rebels 43 commanders would meet this week to 
develop their strategy for the transition period 
the assembly of commanders will decide on it the strategy 
democratically but for the moment we are not willing to 
demobilize he said 
under a plan signed by five central american presidents in 
august the contras were to demobilize by december and turn over 
their weapons to a verification commission they did not 
galeano said he had ordered his troops to act only in 
selfdefense and not to attack sandinista positions to avoid 
armed confrontations that have no reason to occur at this time

trustees of the kimbell art museum a 
louis kahn design hailed by many as a shining example of modern 
architecture voted to postpone indefinitely a roundly criticized 
plan to nearly double gallery space 
kimbell art foundation members announced in a statement tuesday 
they were putting aside the proposal they adopted in july to expand 
the 18yearold museum 
sue ann kahn kahns daughter and a critic of the proposed 
expansion called the trustees decision courageous 
kahns survivors and others had objected to the expansion 
contending the kimbell is a masterpiece that should not be tampered 
with 
nine internationally prominent architects including phillip 
johnson richard meier and james sterling wrote a letter in 
november to the foundation president calling the proposed addition 
mimicry of the most simpleminded character 
the proposal mainly involved adding circular vault sections 
similar to the original to both ends of the building the 8 
million plan would have added 14000 square feet of gallery space

people along the east coast glimpsed 
ribbons of blue white and red light across the predawn sky as 
space shuttle atlantis streaked like a shooting star on a secret 
military mission 
it weaved in and out of the clouds it was beautiful very 
bright it had a long tail said theresa yohn a tv news producer 
in jacksonville fla 
it was almost like another star a white bright pinpoint of 
blue light that continued upwards said mike albertson an editor 
with the savannah evening press who was staked out with binoculars 
at tybee island about 18 mile east of savannah ga 
albertson described the shuttles rocket boosters as twin 
streaks of red side by side 
it was a great show its so incredible that something like 
that could be bearing humans he said 
the 100ton spaceship was spotted as far north as washington 
dc in the minutes following the fiery liftoff at 251 am 
clouds obscured visibility in some areas however as atlantis 
raced up the coast on the highest inclination orbit ever traveled 
by a shuttle 
at first it was pretty much a white light said coast guard 
fireman samuel sellars who watched from his station on ocracoke 
island just south of cape hatteras nc 
all of a sudden it looked kind of like a flare i thought 
there had been another explosion he said 
sellars soon realized he was watching the two solidfuel rockets 
burn out and fall away 
for a moment i was scared he said i feel kind of proud 
now 
after lighting up the sky for miles around the kennedy space 
center atlantis ducked in and out of clouds on a northeasterly 
course the three main engines burned out east of atlantic city 
nj and the shuttle headed toward newfoundland 
wednesdays launch was nasas sixth attempt to send atlantis 
aloft with its fiveman allmilitary crew and a 500 million spy 
satellite the previous efforts were scrubbed because of bad 
weather crew illness and a malfunctioning computer 
among those eagerly awaiting liftoff were doctors at an 
emergency room who asked ms yohns newsroom to call them once the 
shuttle took off 
they couldnt stand outside waiting to see the launch they 
wanted to be able to run outside and watch it pass over and then 
run back inside to work she said

a group calling itself up the irs inc 
claimed responsibility for an explosivesladen truck parked outside 
an internal revenue service office and it threatened more acts 
against the tax agency 
the claim was made in a letter received tuesday by the outlook 
newspaper of santa monica the attempted bombing thursday forced 
thousands of people to evacuate an area around the west los angeles 
irs office 
as long as the irs is used to extort such high unfair and 
ambiguous taxes from the populace using tactics more appropriate to 
the ss or kgb you and the government agencies can expect to see 
more of these events and with increasing severity with successive 
events the letter said 
a bomb squad disarmed the device made of five 55gallon steel 
drums containing explosive chemicals the explosives were in the 
bed of a truck that had been set on fire 
fbi spokesman fred reagan said a group with the same name 
claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded in the area in 1988 
in tuesdays letter up the irs inc said it timed the incident 
to coincide with george washingtons birthday george would have 
applauded and had a good laugh at the distress of the thieves in 
the irs offices it said 
the truck was parked at that location for 48 hours and we 
could have detonated it at any time 
there have been several bombings and attempted bombings of 
southern california irs offices in recent years 
an explosion and fire at a glendale irs office in 1986 caused 
more than 1 million damage authorities defused four pipe bombs at 
a vacant culver city irs office that same week 
in 1987 authorities safely detonated pipe bombs found at a 
laguna niguel irs office

a judge has heaped 450000 more in contempt 
fines on operation rescue but a leader of the debtridden 
antiabortion group says he wont pay one dime 
us district judge robert ward on tuesday imposed a 100000 
fine against operation rescue founder randall terry and 350000 in 
fines against a chapter of the group and nine other people who 
blocked women from entering clinics in new york city and nearby 
counties 
the judge said operation rescue violated his injunction against 
blocking entrances to clinics where abortions are performed he 
also ordered the defendants to pay attorneys fees which have not 
yet been calculated 
this is selective and its disgusting terry said where 
else have there been fines like this for protesting not for animal 
rights groups not for gay groups 
i have no intention of paying one dime of these fines said 
michael mcmonagle an operation rescue deputy director who was 
fined 25000 
other activists also were refusing to pay their fines the new 
york times reported today 
terry said the antiabortion group which has ignored 50000 in 
fines in other states is more than 70000 in debt debts forced 
the group to announce jan 31 the closing of its national 
headquarters in binghamton 
in los angeles 15 operation rescue members were convicted 
monday on misdemeanor charges for a demonstration at a clinic last 
march they face up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine 
mcmonagle said of tuesdays ruling im afraid that it will 
have a chilling effect on many people but babies are being killed 
and we have a moral obligation to save them 
the fines grew out of a lawsuit against terry and his group by 
the national organization for women and other abortionrights 
groups 
mary m gundrum an attorney who worked with now said the 
contempt actions were pursued to give fair warning to those 
persons and groups that the court will proceed to fine them if they 
violate the constitutional rights of women

high school seniors from other states 
apparently shaken by the oct 17 earthquake dont appear as eager 
to attend area colleges according to school officials 
the earthquake reversed a steady increase in freshman applicants 
from outside california at stanford university santa clara 
university and the university of california officials said 
the uc system had a record 19 percent drop in outofstate 
applicants for fall openings at its eight campuses 
including instate applicants uc santa cruz suffered the 
steepest decline with applications down by 118 percent by 
contrast uc san diego had the smallest decline with 05 percent

a number of students back east told our staff i want to 
come but mom and dad dont want me to because of the quake 
said dan saracino dean of undergraduate admissions at the 
university of santa clara where the drop exceeded 6 percent 
stanford applications were off by 13 percent officials said

folks looking for a hot time should head for 
borrego springs calif while gunnison colo is the place for 
cool dudes 
the southern california desert community was the hottest place 
in the nation 50 times last year more often than any other 
community according to the annual rankings published by 
weatherwise magazine gunnison ranked as coldest place most often 
62 times 
officials in both towns see their weather as a boon 
the pipinghot performance of 1989 moved borrego springs into 
the top spot in the warmweather sweepstakes ahead of palm 
springs calif which led the list a year earlier 
were strictly a winter resort area our best time is october 
to may said len surles secretary of the borrego springs chamber 
of commerce thats what brings people here the mild 
temperatures in the winter time the lack of bad weather 
he said only about 2700 people live all year in the town about 
90 miles from san diego but that can double in winter 
while borrego springs was the national hot spot most often last 
years hottest reading outside of death valley calif was 121 
degrees that dubious distinction was shared by blythe and palm 
springs calif on july 4 and laughlin nev the next day 
located high in the chilly rocky mountains gunnison was first 
in frost for the fifth straight year according to the analysis 
prepared by david h hickcox a professor of geography at ohio 
wesleyan college in delaware ohio 
winter sports are a feature at gunnison located in a valley 
7700 feet above sea level 
its a fun place to live if you like the outdoors its a 
paradise said dale howard city manager of the community of 
7000 located 200 miles southwest of denver 
the low temperatures occur in the early hours of the morning 
when cold air settles from the rocky mountains into gunnison 
howard said adding that most days are sunny and that the 
temperature warms up rapidly after sunrise 
last years single coldest reading was 54 degrees below zero 
feb 6 at logan canyon utah 
hickcoxs analysis excludes death valley calif from the heat 
list and alaska from the cold list since the extremes recorded in 
those places would nearly always dominate the standings 
for the record death valley had a maximum reading of 127 
degrees july 7 and the top temperature there was over 100 every day 
from june 6 to sept 18 alaska had a numbing 76 below zero at 
tanana on jan 27 lowest reading for the year in north america 
the average for the month of january at fort yukon was 335 below 
zero 
following gunnison on the icy list was truckee calif the 
coldest spot on 28 days fraser colo 23 days leadville colo 
20 and wisdom mont 19 
on the sultry side of the statistics borrego springs was 
trailed by bullhead city ariz which was the hot spot 45 times 
and then by dethroned champ palm springs which was the sweatiest 
place 33 times 
rounding out the fiery five were laughlin nev with 28 highest 
readings and tied for fifth at 27 days with the top torrid 
temperature were laredo and mcallen texas

a neurologist who improperly signed more than 100 
prescriptions for narcotics has been fined 390000 the largest 
amount in a civil lawsuit against a doctor for improper drug 
distribution the government said 
the fine approved tuesday by us district judge andrew caffrey 
settled a lawsuit brought against dr julian ungarsargon 
he was accused of leaving batches of signed prescription forms 
for percodan and percocet which are pain relievers with 
associates at the manomet medical center in plymouth southeast of 
boston 
ungarsargon owned and operated the center in 1985 and 1986 at 
that time the government alleges he was not authorized to write 
prescriptions in massachusetts and spent only a few hours at the 
center every two weeks 
there is no charge of illegal drug distribution at all said 
ungarsargons lawyer nancy gertner there are a host of 
complicated regulations he did not follow

an organization representing more than 100 
foreign journalists today requested a meeting with government 
officials to discuss a recent increase in police surveillance 
we strongly object to this interference in the journalistic 
work of accredited foreign correspondents the foreign 
correspondents club of beijing said in a letter to foreign ministry 
it requested a meeting with the ministrys director of 
information li zhaoxing and representatives of relevant 
security organizations at the earliest possible date 
the letter was delivered to the ministry today and there was no 
immediate response more than 130 foreign correspondents from more 
than two dozen countries belong to the organization 
police have sharply increased surveillance of foreign 
journalists since martial law was lifted in beijing last month 
correspondents from nearly a dozen news organizations including 
americans europeans and soviets said they have been tailed at 
least once by plainclothes police in the past few weeks 
one reporter said his chinese friends had been warned by their 
employers to stop seeing him three chinese who visited another 
reporters home last week were taken away by security agents as 
they left 
foreign journalists have faced reduced access to officials and 
tighter controls since june when the army was called in to crush 
massive popular protests for democracy some have been tailed from 
time to time but surveillance has become markedly more intense 
since jan 11 when martial law was lifted 
under martial law foreign journalists were required to get 
military approval for all interviews police surveillance appears 
to be a substitute measure 
foreign minister qian qichen in geneva to attend a disarmament 
conference said the reports of stepped up surveillance were 
inaccurate and warned that any secret activities by foreign 
journaists would prompt official response 
as during past upsurges of conservative ideology longstanding 
official suspicion and resentment of all foreigners also has come 
to the fore a western diplomat in shanghai said security guards 
recently accused his driver of being a foreign lackey and beat him 
up

a group of roman catholics is seeking 100000 
signatures on a petition calling for major reform in the church 
a fullpage advertisement in todays new york times calls for 
the acceptance of women and married people into the priesthood 
development of catholic church teachings on sexuality financial 
openness and an end to the silencing of theologians

dan dailey head of the chicagobased group call to action 
which placed the ad said that the credibility of the churchs

churchs internal structure was changed 
the group argues for more participation by catholics at all 
levels of the church more outreach to racial and ethnic 
minorities academic freedom and consultation before choosing 
bishops or closing of parishes and their schools 
reaction to the call for reform was mixed 
helen hull hitchcock the director of women for faith and 
family said it was deplorable for such a divisive 
statement to be released on ash wednesday a solemn holy day the 
organization stresses strict adherence to church doctrine 
the rev kenneth j doyle a spokesman for the national 
conference of catholic bishops sounded a conciliatory note 
some of these opinions we would identify with strongly others 
we would have some difficulty with doyle said 
dailey acknowledged that the vatican would most likely frown on 
the call for reform 
but a year or two ago nobody in their right mind would have 
dreamed of the changes in eastern europe he said

want freedom took to the streets of this city today demanding 
that moslemdominated kashmir valley be granted autonomy from 
india witnesses said 
the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said local 
hindus and sikhs joined moslems in the procession through the city 
the witnesses said at least 300000 of the citys one million 
people joined the demonstration 
we want liberty we want freedom marchers chanted the 
witnesses said 
the movement for an independent kashmir has mostly been led by 
the areas moslems who form about 65 percent the population of 
jammukashmir the only state with a moslem majority in 
predominantly hindu india 
the fourdecadeold agitation has flared in recent months 
a government crackdown on the movement on jan 18 prompted 
confrontations between demonstrators and security forces in which 
at least 112 people have been killed 
witnesses said paramilitary police lined the route of the 
procession but did not attempt to break up the demonstration most 
shops in the city were closed in support 
kashmir once a princely state was divided between india and 
pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end 
of british colonial rule in 1947 srinagar and the surrounding 
areas of the valley became part of indianheld jammukashmir state 
moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million population and 
hindus comprise 82 percent sikhs christians and buddhists make up 
the rest 
kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with 
pakistan which claims kashmir because of its predominant moslem 
population but now demand independence and the status of a neutral 
nation 
india has fought two wars with pakistan over kashmir and the two 
nations have traded angry statements in recent weeks blaming each 
other for the trouble in the valley

watching space shuttle landings will be closed when atlantis 
touches down after its classified military mission nasa said 
the shuttle was launched from florida early today reportedly to 
put a 500 million spy satellite in orbit the landing time wont 
be announced until 24 hours beforehand but the mission is expected 
to last about 4 days so atlantis should land at this mojave 
desert military base sunday morning 
during nonmilitary shuttle flights up to 500000 people have 
jammed onto the unpaved public viewing site on the east shore of 
rogers dry lake 
but after secret missions its been department of defense 
policy to restrict the public from watching the landings said 
don haley a spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
the rationale for the ban isnt clear since news reporters and 
photographers have been allowed to watch and photograph military 
shuttle landings and they have done so from a site closer to the 
runway than the public viewing site 
those landings also have been televised and the shuttle 
landings are visible at a distance from portions of highway 58 
north of edwards air force base 
haley said the viewing site will be open after the next shuttle 
flight when discovery lands after a fiveday mission to put the 
hubble space telescope in orbit around the earth discovery is

prosecutors said today they would not 
seek an indictment against former president choi kyuhah the 
legislature had sought criminal charges after he refused to testify 
about a civil uprising in 1980 
senior prosecutor park soonyong cited executive privilege and 
national security concerns in making the decision 
choi a former prime minister briefly served as a figurehead 
president after the assassination of his predecessor park chunghee 
in late 1979 he was succeeded by chun doohwan who seized power 
with military backing in 1980 
the national assembly sought criminal charges against choi early 
last month after the expresident ignored five subpoenas to testify 
on his alleged role in the military crackdown on a prodemocracy 
movement in the southern city of kwangju in 1980 about 200 people 
were killed and more than 1500 injured in the 10day uprising the 
worst in modern korean history 
a special parliament committee investigating the tragedy 
summoned choi to testify on the incident but he refused to citing 
executive privilege 
when chun was subpeoned late last year he testified before in a 
raucous session that shed little light on his role in putting down 
the uprising

a college freshman was shocked when he 
returned to his dorm room and found his bed had been occupied by 
someone dead for a long long time the body was a 2500yearold 
unwrapped egyptian mummy 
the mummy had been swiped from its wesleyan university hiding 
place and slipped into tim abels bed as a practical joke campus 
public safety officials and abel said tuesday 
abel said he had returned to his dorm room saturday night to 
find a crowd gathering and a prankster trying to spirit a body 
away abel grabbed the body to see if it was real and was 
disgusted to find flakes chipped off in his hand the prankster 
whom abel declined to identify fled clutching the body 
it was one of the most putrid things ive ever seen said 
abel of wilmington del i looked at my bed and there were all 
these skin chips and little chips in it it was pretty disgusting 
the espisode is being investigated by middletown police and 
campus security officers wesleyan president william m chace 
promises to make sure the mummy receives proper care and respect a 
school spokesman said 
a wesleyan classics professor bought the mummy in athens in the 
1880s at a time when pilfering egyptian tombs was popular the 
5foot 2inch body was displayed at the universitys natural 
history museum until the 1950s when interest in mummies waned and 
it was stored in a library attic 
university scholars decided in 1978 to study the mummy further 
an xray showed it was a young man with four mysterious tubes in 
his tummy 
the mummy was unwrapped and sliced open a year later in the 
universitys archaeology lab the tubes showed traces of organic 
matter leading the scholars to conclude that bits of organs 
removed from the body during mummification had been sewn back to be 
reunited with the body in the afterlife 
inscriptions on the bandages and other evidence led to the 
conclusion that the mummy had been a scholar and a member of 
egypts priestly class who died in his early 20s 
since then the mummy had been wrapped in plastic and stored in 
a wooden crate after its surprise appearance in abels room it 
was returned to its climatecontrolled resting place in a campus 
building

nelson mandela today reiterated that the 
african national congress will not hold talks with the south 
african government until south africas white leaders meet 
longstanding conditions 
those conditions include lifting the 3yearold state of 
emergency and a general amnesty for exiles selected to take part in 
preliminary talks with south african president fw de klerk 
the simple position is that until south africa complies with 
the preconditions we have set the anc is not in the same position 
as the national party of de klerk mandela told reporters after 
meeting with seven african presidents and commonwealth leaders in 
lusaka 
whatever political or security problems the government faces in 
south africa the anc cannot be expected to make any 
concessions he said 
mandela was on the second day of a visit to zambia where he met 
with exiled anc leaders at their external headquarters 
it was his first trip out of south africa since a clandestine 
border crossing in 1962 later that year mandela was jailed for 
plotting against the south african government he was freed feb 11 
de klerk legalized the anc feb 2 but mandela demanded a 
general amnesty for anc exiles to prevent them from being 
prosecuted if they entered south africa to take part in talks he 
said the legalization of the anc might not protect all exiles from 
prosecution for certain offenses 
the refusal to accommodate the anc demands showed it is quite 
clear the government is not yet prepared to meet us mandela said 
mandela compared the situation of south africas black majority 
to that of palestinians in israel saying we live under a unique 
form of colonialism in south africa as well as in israel 
he defended his support of plo leader yasser arafat who arrived 
in zambia on tuesday to meet with him and also defended the ancs 
support of continued economic sanctions against the south africa 
government to pressure it to lift apartheid 
britians unilateral decision to lift an investment ban will be 
taken up directly by the anc with prime minister margaret thatcher 
he said thatcher has argued that sanctions hurt south africas 
blacks the most and she said easing sanctions would encourage de 
klerk to press ahead with reforms 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia one of the ancs staunchest 
suporters said mandela met with leaders of the six black african 
frontline nations surrounding south africa and with members of a 
ninenation committee on southern africa set up by the commonwealth 
the commonwealth leaders and the frontline nations angola 
botswana mozambique tanzania zambia and zimbabwe endorsed the 
ancs policy on economic sanctions and agreed there should be no 
immediate easing of punitive measures 
mandela is on an 18day fournation tour that will also take 
him to zimbabwe tanzania and sweden

predictions of imminent doom for the east 
german economy have fallen off in recent days as march 18 elections 
draw nearer and the countrys currency surges against the powerful 
west german mark 
boosted by expectations of a favorable exchange rate once the 
west german currency becomes legal tender in both countries the 
east mark rocketed by as much as 30 percent in black market trading 
tuesday to 2150 west german marks for every 100 east marks 
currency traders in west germany and austria said 
before west german chancellor helmut kohl announced plans feb 6 
to fuse the two german economies in a monetary union as a first 
step to political unification the unofficial traders paid out only 
14 to 18 west german marks for each 100 east marks 
the dire predictions prompted bonn to offer monetary union and 
accelerate political unification 
explaining the east marks surge reinhard pohl a monetary 
expert at the german economic research institute in west berlin 
said some west germans have been trading their convertible 
deutschmarks at the favorable blackmarket rate of about five to 
one then giving the east german marks to relatives or friends in 
east germany in hopes they can be traded back at one or twotoone 
after currency union 
bonn officials have sought to discount speculation that west 
germanys central bank would buy east germans estimated 17 billion 
marks of savings at a onetoone ratio but no final decision is 
expected on the exchange rate until after the elections 
a onetoone exchange would cost west germany billions and raise 
the possibility of high inflation something that postwar west 
germany has worked to avoid 
nevertheless many west germans consider drastic economic 
assistance for east germany necessary to staunch the flow of 
thousands of east germans to the west the immigrants have strained 
west german housing and social services 
on tuesday a small east german party backed by kohls christian 
democratic union called for postponement of the vote because it 
said election rules hadnt been released in time to allow a fair 
fight for the 400 parliamentary seats to be decided 
the rules were printed and made available to bookstores friday 
but did not appear in newspapers 
the german social union is a member of a conservative coalition 
that originally pushed for east germanys first free elections to 
be advanced from the original date of may 6 in part out of fear 
that neither the communistled government nor the economy could 
hold out that long 
some larger parties including the communists have political 
networks with offices telephones vehicles and other advantages 
not available to new groups that have sprung up since a peaceful 
popular revolt toppled hardline communist leaders last fall 
even so the clear leader is the social democratic party 
founded less than five months ago and supported by a sister party 
that is west germanys main opposition 
polls of east german voters predict the social democrats will 
get at least 50 percent if the elections are held on march 18 
kohls christian democratic union supports the german social 
union east germanys christian democrats and the democratic 
awakening which are joined in conservative alliance

senate minority leader bob dole says hes not 
giving up his effort to gain approval of a measure to mark the 
deaths of hundreds of thousands of armenians during in the reign of 
the ottoman empire 
the kansas republican who lost a second procedural vote in the 
senate said tuesday that he might introduce the controversial 
resolution in another form 
the measure which designates april 24 as national day of 
remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 
19151923 has created a firestorm in turkey where officials 
strenuously object to the use of the word genocide 
the turkish government praised the setback to the resolution 
sen robert byrd dwva waged a filibuster against the 
resolution last week arguing the measure could seriously 
jeopardize us relations with turkey 
the senate refused by a 5148 vote to cut off debate 
dole said americans of armenian heritage deserved to be 
recognized for their suffering and called the resolution a human 
rights issue 
the alleged genocide occurred before the birth of the republic 
of turkey armenians say 15 million were killed because of their 
race 
turkish officials dispute the alleged genocide they say some 
600000 people including muslims and christians were killed in the 
turbulent times because of civil strife and marauding bands 
the bush administration opposed the resolution but dole said 
tuesday that white house officials would not object to softening 
the language in the measure and making it a concurrent resolution 
bush would not have to sign such a measure 
in ankara today murat sungar spokesman for the turkish foreign 
ministry praised the senates action saying we note with 
appreciation the fact that an important number of the esteemed 
senators acted with composure prudence and foresight refusing to 
condone the distortion of historical realities 
sungar said that adoption of the measure would have negative 
effects on bilateral ties as well as shaking the stability of the 
region

sales of existing homes fell 22 percent last 
month pulled down by higher mortgage interest rates combined with 
the usual january buying lull a real estate trade group reported 
today 
the national association of realtors said january sales totaled 
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 348 million units the 
slowest since last augusts 344 million rate 
interest rates rose from 983 percent to 1005 percent last 
month according to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the rate rise made a dent in highend and lessexpensive 
markets said realtors president norman d flynn who also noted 
that the beginning of a year is generally a slow home sales period 
nar chief economist john a tuccillo said a big increase in 
sales is unlikely in the coming months because of the mortgage 
rates but added that as rates taper off in the spring we expect 
sales to pick up mainly in markets offering moderately priced 
homes 
the national median price for existing singlefamily homes last 
month was 96200 up 4 percent from december and 71 percent from 
january 1989 the median means half of the homes cost more half 
less 
the south was the only region posting an increase in sales in 
january up 07 percent to 140 million units the median price 
there was 86300 
the biggest decline in sales was in the west where the 
540000unit pace was 115 percent below the december rate the 
median price was 144000 up 7 percent from january 1989 but a 
smaller increase than recent annual price hikes in the region 
the high priced highvolume markets on californias west 
coast cooled down tuccillo said 
sales in the northeast were down 34 percent to 560000 units 
the median price there was 147100 prompting tuccillo to observe 
that highcost areas in the northeast remain sluggish and this 
likely will continue through the year 
the midwest resale rate of 960000 units was 2 percent below the 
december pace the median price there was 746000

prime minister yitzhak shamir will probably 
reject usbacked compromises aimed at starting peace talks with 
palestinians because of stiff resistance within his likud bloc 
vice premier shimon peres said today 
peres the head of the leftleaning labor party spoke in an 
interview amid a widening rebellion against shamir by hardliners 
in his rightwing bloc 
former industry minister ariel sharon who quit the cabinet two 
weeks ago to protest shamirs policies has threatened to convene 
likuds decisionmaking central committee next week without the 
prime ministers consent 
other likud lawmakers said they would support a vote of no 
confidence against shamir if he agrees to a usbacked formula 
that would include palestinians from east jerusalem or palestinian 
deportees in peace talks 
asked if he thought shamir could overcome the differences and 
move middle east peace efforts ahead by accepting compromises 
proposed by us secretary of state james a baker iii peres said 
i have my doubts baker has been attempting to bridge 
differences between israel and palestinians over the composition of 
a palestinian delegation for preliminary peace talks in cairo 
the talks are to focus on israels plan for elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip that would lead to limited 
selfrule for 17 million palestinians in the occupied lands 
hundreds of palestinians and about 40 israelis have been killed 
during the last 27 months in a palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the territories 
peres whose party agrees to bakers suggestions has given 
shamir a march 7 deadline to approve them we are nearing the 
real decision now peres said in a week or so we shall see 
what is happening 
he described the current crisis as more serious than previous 
ones and added from the likud point of view they have reached 
the point where they have to make up their mind 
peres indicated that labor would leave its coalition with likud 
and try to form a new government with smaller religious and 
leftwing parties if likud continues to balk at peace efforts 
asked whether he was ready to form a new cabinet peres said 
maybe i dont exclude it 
the hadashot daily quoted peres as telling party activists 
tuesday he could put together a narrow government within 10 days if 
shamirs government falls 
peres also told the associated press that if he forms a new 
government he will continue to back the israeli elections plan 
rather seek a new peace formula if there was a new government it 
would stay with the current approach peres said 
bakers compromise on the composition of a palestinian 
delegation calls for including palestinians from east jerusalem and 
some deported by israel in preliminary cairo peace talks israeli 
newspapers said they also call for egypt to announce the names of 
the delegates and for the agenda to be left open to allow 
palestinians to bring up subjects other than the elections 
including palestinians from east jerusalem has been a major 
sticking point for likud which fears such a move would undercut 
israels claim to the entire mixed jewisharab city as its capital 
israel annexed the arab sector after capturing it from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war 
im not sure east jerusalem is the only issue peres said 
they likud think its the wrong way to go 
likud fears that some of the proposals could lead to indirect 
involvement by the plo which israel considers a terrorist 
organization it also opposes any landforpeace settlement which 
the united states and labor would accept

the us economy grew by 09 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 1989 faster than previously estimated but still 
the slowest pace in more than three years the government said 
today 
the commerce department said its revised estimate of 
octoberdecember growth means the gross national product the 
nations total output of goods and services rose 3 percent for 
all of 1989 
that was the slowest yearly advance since a 27 percent gain in 
1986 and followed a 44 percent increase in 1988 
the fourthquarter gain was stronger than the initial report 
last month of 05 percent growth but was still the lowest since a 
08 percent advance in the third quarter of 1986 
a consensus of economists had indicated in advance of the new 
report that fourthquarter growth would be lowered to 04 percent 
the improvement should ease fears the economy had entered a 
downturn at years end although there is considerable anxiety over 
the months ahead 
the department will make one more revision in the gnp the 
broadest measure of the nations economic health after more solid 
information is available next month 
a recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarterly 
declines in the gnp the last decline was a onequarter drop of 18 
percent in 1986 after which the economy resumed growth the last 
recession occurred in 198182 
since then the economic expansion has continued for 87 months 
and in november broke the peacetime growth record if it continues 
through october 1991 it will set a new overall record 
an inflation index tied to the gnp rose 45 percent last year 
the report said the fourthquarter figure was revised downward 
from the 38 percent annual rate reported initially to 36 percent 
today 
some economists including chairman michael boskin of president 
bushs council of economic advisers had attributed the 
sluggishness in the fourth quarter in part to the effects of the 
fourth coldest december on record hurricane hugo and the san 
francisco bayarea earthquake 
most of the upward revision was attributed to a 
betterthananticipated trade performance the december trade 
deficit was not available when the advance gnp estimate was made 
the new report said exports climbed at an annual rate of 86 
percent in the fourth quarter compared with the advance estimate 
of 49 percent imports grew by 2 percent in the revised report 
instead of 75 percent first reported 
business inventories meanwhile were lowered from an initial 
489 percent increase to a 196 percent gain today 
other changes included personal consumption up 04 percent 
rather than the 01 percent decline first reported 
but business investment declined 64 percent in the latest 
estimate compared with a 3 percent decline in the first 
despite the improvement in fourthquarter growth several jolts 
from recent economic indicators have prompted some analysts to 
question whether the nations manufacturing economy will be able to 
avoid further deterioration this year and whether it will spread to 
other areas 
there is just not any evidence that the manufacturing sector 
has any strength said paul getman an economist with regional 
financial associates in west chester pa the question is whether 
this weakness in manufacturing will spread to other sectors of the 
economy 
the latest jolt to the current quarters growth was the commerce 
departments report on tuesday that orders to us factories for 
durable goods plummeted 105 percent last month in their steepest 
fall in 32 years of government recordkeeping 
the report signifies an ongoing recession for a chunk of the 
us manufacturing sector said allen sinai chief economist for 
the boston co 
the sharp decline is another sign well see virtually no real 
economic growth in the first quarter added jerry jasinowski 
president of the national association of manufacturers youve 
got pockets of recession in sectors such as automobiles surrounded 
by an absence of activity in the economy in general 
less than two weeks ago the commerce department reported that 
industrial production in january fell 12 percent its largest drop 
since falling 13 percent four years earlier 
the economic weakness has prompted the bush administration and 
many economists to urge the federal reserve to permit interest 
rates to fall further and thus stimulate the economy the central 
bank has kept a tight rein on credit for a year in an attempt to 
drive down inflation 
but the government reported last week that consumer prices rose 
a hefty 11 percent last month the largest advance since a 14 
percent gain 10 years ago and fed chairman alan greenspan 
indicated in congressional testimony that the central bank is 
unlikely to loosen its grip soon 
the feds tightmoney policy is blamed for economic growth 
slowing from 3 percent during the third quarter of 1989 
however two recent surveys indicate optimism that while 
economic activity will continue to be sluggish this year the 
economy will avoid sliding into a recession 
eightytwo percent of the executives questioned in a national 
association of manufacturers poll said 1990 will produce slow 
growth but no recession 
and 606 percent of the professional forecasters surveyed by the 
national association of business economists said they believe the 
economy will avoid a recession for the next three years 
but the latter survey found the economy is in a danger 
zone and the probability of a recession is not trivial

mayor marion barry pleaded innocent today to 
cocaine possession and perjury charges filed after a 14month 
investigation of his ties to a convicted drug dealer 
at the brief hearing us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson set june 4 for the trial on three felony charges of lying 
to a grand jury and five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges 
barry dressed in a grey suit white shirt and burgundy tie sat 
frowning at the defense table as he read over the indictment he 
then sat expressionless as his attorney r kenneth mundy entered 
the innocent pleas 
us attorney jay b stephens said in a statement after the 
hearing that his office was proceeding with a related grand jury 
investigation into city government corruption 
mundy said in a statement outside the courthouse that barry was 
anticipating the trial and anticipating winning the trial 
the lawyer said there would be no plea bargaining and barry 
would not resign from public office there is no reason for him 
to resign in our democratic system an accused person is 
guaranteed the presumption of innocence until proven guilty he 
added 
barry who has denied ever using cocaine or other drugs has 
been undergoing treatment at substance abuse centers in florida and 
south carolina for what aides have said is alcoholism 
mundy said the mayors treatment for alcoholism was going 
well and barry was in good spirits 
barry entered the courthouse through a side door and held up two 
fingers in a victory sign 
extraordinary security procedures were in effect reporters and 
photographers were moved across the street to allow barry free 
access to the courthouse 
mundy said he advised barrys wife effi not to attend the 
hearing and she did not 
barry and his wife had difficulty entering the building for a 
court appearance on jan 19 the day after he was arrested because 
of a crush of reporters and camera crews 
several members of the guardian angels an anticrimepatrol 
group carried signs calling for barrys resignation outside the 
courthouse today one sign read do the right thing resign 
barry arrived in the nations capital tuesday from the fenwick 
hall hospital outside charleston sc where he is enrolled in a 
substance abuse treatment program 
the charges stem from an investigation into barrys ties to a 
convicted drug dealer one possession charge involved the mayors 
jan 18 arrest in an fbi sting operation at a downtown washington 
hotel 
city corporation counsel herbert o reid said barry would return 
to fenwick hall hospital after his court appearance 
mundy refused to comment when he arrived at barrys office for a 
meeting with top city officials late tuesday he declined to say 
who he was meeting with but sources said mundy city administrator 
carol b thompson and barry chief of staff maudine cooper met for 
almost an hour 
none of the three would comment afterward 
the mayors arraignment date was postponed from feb 21 after 
his attorney argued that the first appearance date would interfere 
with the florida substance abuse treatment program in which the 
mayor was enrolled barry moved to the south carolina facility last 
week 
the grand jury that indicted him met tuesday but handled other 
matters and did not review the mayors case sources familiar with 
the proe said 
last week prosecutors subpoenaed city records relating to eight 
close friends of the mayors and sources close to the probe say 
investigators are trying to learn whether the mayor participated in 
any contracting irregularities or whether any of his friends 
skirted city contracting law in getting contracts 
last month stephens said the fbi sting operation that netted 
the mayor was part of a broad ongoing probe into allegations 
of wrongdoing involving both barry and various city services 
if convicted of all charges filed against him the mayor could 
face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 125 million 
fine

the soviet legislature today overwhelmingly 
approved a bill that would allow citizens to lease land and 
bequeath it to their children for the first time since peasants 
were stripped of their farms under stalin 
the legislature first voted on each chapter of the 52article 
law separately and then approved the entire law 3497 with 12 
abstentions 
it is part of a package of measures designed to give force of 
law to the economic and social reforms championed by president 
mikhail s gorbachev the official tass news agency called it a 
major legal document of soviet economic reform 
according to the current soviet constitution all land in the 
soviet union is the property of the state 
the government hopes that if this is changed to allow peasants 
on collective or stateowned farms to acquire their own plots 
productivity on that land will increase productivity on 
stateowned and collective farms currently is notoriously low 
the congress of peoples deputies the supreme soviets parent 
body will be asked to amend the constitution to incorporate the 
new law when it meets march 12 
todays fourhour session was the third time the supreme soviet 
considered the law on land during debate on the bill earlier this 
month about 150 proposals and criticisms were made 
alexander nikonov president of the soviet agricultural academy 
who submitted the bill said about 40 percent of the original draft 
had been revised 
the law states that land is the property of the people living on 
a given territory and that every soviet citizen has the right to a 
piece of land 
land would be distributed by collective farms or in the case of 
city dwellers or other who wanted to hold land by local officials 
the land would not actually be purchased but leased and 
selling it would be illegal according to the law plots would be 
subject to taxes but could be bequeathed to the holders children 
the state would set land prices 
supreme soviet deputy pavel bunich an economist said a 
nationwide evaluation of the land would have to be carried out 
before any distribution could begin 
he said he was concerned that local governments would make 
available only undesirable land 
the law represents a major step forward in wresting control of 
the land from the state the bolsheviks socialized land in 1918 
which took away holdings from many city dwellers peasants were 
allowed to keep land until the brutal policy of collectivization 
went into effect in the late 1920s 
millions of peasants died in labor camps or of famine as a 
result of stalins collectivization plan which crippled soviet 
agriculture 
in action tuesday the legislature approved by a wide margin the 
creation of a much stronger soviet presidency an office gorbachev 
is widely expected to hold 
subject to final approval by the congress of peoples deputies 
the president will be granted powers to veto laws unilaterally 
declare states of emergency and name the prime minister according 
to a copy of the bill shown to western reporters 
gorbachev who chaired the legislatures proceedings emphasized 
he has not yet been elected president and said he has even 
considered refusing the office but few expect the 58yearold 
communist party chief not to be chosen 
according to vice president anatoly i lukyanov the supreme 
soviet is to meet in closed session on thursday to discuss the 
ethnic conflict between the two soviet republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan now in its third year

the federal government and a utilities 
group are providing 93 million to westinghouse electric corp for 
a project to develop smaller simpler nuclear plants by 1999 
the energy department on tuesday granted pittsburghbased 
westinghouse 50 million to develop blueprints that will be 
submitted to the federal nuclear regulatory commission for approval 
electric utilities are chipping in 43 million said jack berga 
a lobbyist with the electric power research institute in 
washington dc 
while environmentalists and coal producers dispute that the 
scaleddown plants will reduce cost and safety concerns about 
nuclear power westinghouse portrays the project which it began in 
1984 as getting back to basics 
this goes back to our first principles of plant design for the 
nuclear navy they were simple designed to be run by sailors 
said richard slember director of the westinghouses energy unit in 
monroeville 15 miles east of pittsburgh 
high costs and construction delays are keeping electric 
utilities out of the nuclear power industry slember said the new 
plants will cost about 2 billion onethird less than existing 
facilities he said 
westinghouse said its plants will take three years to build 
construction of existing plants has taken as long as 17 years 
the plants are economic reliable longlived and to use a 
computer term userfriendly said berga 
westinghouses plans for the new reactors called ap600s fall 
in line with those of president bush an energy department official 
said 
the president has indicated that nuclear power must play a 
critical role in meeting our energy needs the nuclear option can 
restore viability by the end of this decade said david mcgoff a 
deputy secretary in the departments nuclear division 
not so said a spokesman for american coal producers 
nuclear power cant do it by itself national coal 
association spokesman john grasser said from washington dc and 
i dont see any major rush on the part of utility producers to get 
off of fossil fuels yeah we believe in nuclear power but 
its only one piece among a lot of pieces 
the westinghouse plants would employ 200 to 300 people slember 
said they would use 60 percent fewer valves and 60 percent less 
piping 
slember said they also would be safer than current plants 
because the ap600 is less susceptible to the kind of errors human 
operators make 
judith johnsrud director of the environmental coalition on 
nuclear power a pennsylvania group based in state college said 
the new plants may be termed inherently safe but the wastes they 
generate are inherently unsafe 
federal regulators expect westinghouse to submit its plant 
design sometime this year spokesman john kopeck said from nrc 
offices in bethesda md he said licensing of subsequent plants 
could be sped up if a standardized design plan is approved 
the commission approved the last new us nuclear plant in 1978 
kopeck said there are 112 nuclear reactors operating in the united 
states he said 
westinghouses new plants would be capable of producing 600 
megawatts or enough power for a city of about 600000 people most 
nuclear plants supply from 900 to 1100 megawatts

the supreme court today gave police broad new 
power to conduct sweeping searches after making arrests in private 
homes 
by a 72 vote the justices said the police may use evidence 
seized when they arrested a maryland man jerome buie accused of 
armed robbery the ruling reinstated buies conviction and 35year 
prison sentence 
justice byron r white writing for the court said police may 
search throughout a house when they have a reasonable suspicion 
there is a hidden danger to the arresting officers even if the 
authorities lack a search warrant and probable cause to believe 
there is a danger 
white said the constitution permits a properly limited 
protective sweep in conjunction with an inhome arrest when the 
searching officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific 
and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an 
individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene 
prince georges county police investigating the feb 3 1986 
armed robbery of a restaurant obtained arrest warrants for buie and 
lloyd allen 
a halfdozen police officers went to buies home in riverdale 
two days after the robbery to arrest him after entering the home 
they looked for him on the first and second floors 
one officer went to the basement stairs and yelled for anyone 
who might be down there to come out 
buie eventually emerged and climbed the basement stairs to be 
searched handcuffed and arrested by the officers 
at that point another officer descended the stairs to the 
basement where he saw a red running suit similar to one a victim 
of the robbery said was worn by one of the holdup men 
the suit was introduced as evidence that helped convict buie 
the maryland court of appeals the states highest ordered a 
new trial for buie by a 43 vote the state court said buies 
rights protected by the fourth amendment to the constitution were 
violated because police lacked a search warrant and probable cause 
to search the basement 
before today police making arrests generally were allowed to 
conduct such protective searches only of the area within a 
suspects reach 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
today 
brennan writing for both said the ruling gives police too much 
discretion to search the special sanctity of a private 
residence 
police officers searching for potential ambushers might 
open up closets lockers chests wardrobes and cars and peer 
under beds and behind furniture brennan said even personal 
letters and documents could be inspected he said 
the case is maryland vs buie 881369

the government newspaper izvestia confirmed 
western news reports of an attempted mutiny aboard a soviet naval 
ship in 1975 that tom clancy used as the basis of his bestseller 
the hunt for red october 
the book is about an officer aboard a soviet nuclear sub on a 
secret mission who decides to defect to the west taking the vessel 
with him 
in the book which was made into a movie to be released next 
month soviet naval forces chase the sub and us forces try to 
give it safe passage to the united states 
in washington clancy said today he was contacted by an izvestia 
reporter who told him the imminent release of the red october 
movie gave the soviet government an excuse to acknowledge the 
incident really did take place 
on tuesday a military prosecutors office admitted the 
antisubmarine ship storozhevoi tried to escape to sweden in 
november 1975 the news agency tass quoted izvestia as saying 
according to the office the ships deputy commanding officer 
capt 3rd rank valery sablin led the attempted mutiny the 
newspaper said 
his plan was to commandeer the storozhevoi after isolating the 
commanding officer and other officers and deceiving the crew into 
obeying his orders izvestia said 
the newspaper said sablin was able to get the ship across the 
soviet border in the baltic sea 21 miles toward swedish territorial 
waters but his plan fell through when the storozhevoi was 
intercepted and returned to base the newspaper said 
it was not known whether any crew members supported the mutiny 
izvestia quoted the military prosecutors office as saying 
breaking the oath of enlistment commandeering a naval ship 
removing it from subordination to the naval command and refusing to 
obey orders are grave military crimes and betrayals of ones 
homeland 
sablin was tried by the supreme courts military wing found 
guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad according to 
isvestia the report did not specify whether the sentence was 
carried out

the supreme court today bolstered the fight 
against international drug trafficking and terrorism by giving us 
law enforcement agents more power to conduct searches in foreign 
countries 
in another decision it gave police broad new power to conduct 
sweeping searches after making arrests in private homes 
and in a third ruling the court upheld pennsylvanias death 
penalty laws removing a threat to similar laws in 13 other states 
by a 63 vote the justices said us agents did not need a 
court warrant to search the home of a suspected mexican drug 
smuggler later convicted in the killing of a federal drug agent 
the ruling gives us law enforcement officials broad authority 
to conduct warrantless searches abroad of nonus citizens 
the constitutions fourth amendment ban on illegal searches does 
not apply to noncitizens outside us borders chief justice 
william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
situations threatening to important american interests may 
arise halfway around the globe that require an american 
response with armed force rehnquist said if there are to be 
restrictions on searches and seizures which occur incident to such 
american action they must be imposed by the political branches 
through diplomatic understanding treaty or legislation 
the dissenters said the ruling may cause disrespect here and 
abroad for us laws and constitutional protections 
when we tell the world that we expect all people wherever 
they may be to abide by our laws we cannot in the same breath 
tell the world that our law enforcement officers need not do the 
same said justice william j brennan in a dissent joined by 
justice thurgood marshall 
justice harry a blackmun also dissented 
in the domestic search case the justices ruled 72 that the 
police may use evidence seized when they arrested a maryland man 
accused of armed robbery the ruling reinstated jerome buies 
conviction and 35year prison sentence 
justice byron r white writing for the court said police may 
search throughout a house when they have a reasonable suspicion 
there is a hidden danger to the arresting officers even if the 
authorities lack a search warrant and probable cause to believe 
there is a danger 
in the death penalty case the justices ruled that 
pennsylvanias laws do not limit improperly the discretion of 
sentencing juries and are not impermissibly mandatory 
the decision removes a threat that existed for similar death 
penalty laws in arizona california connecticut idaho illinois 
maryland montana new jersey ohio oregon tennessee texas and 
washington 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
states enjoy wide latitude in drawing capitalpunishment laws 
the fact that other states have enacted different forms of 
death penalty statutes which also satisfy constitutional 
requirements casts no doubt on pennsylvanias choice rehnquist 
said 
the international search ruling could have a bearing on the 
governments prosecution of manuel antonio noriega the ousted 
panamanian leader who faces drugtrafficking and moneylaundering 
charges from a 12count indictment handed down in february 1988 
after us troops invaded panama in december to capture noriega he 
surrendered and was brought to the united states to stand trial in 
florida 
there has been speculation that noriegas lawyers might argue 
us armed forces illegally seized evidence in the invasion 
the decision was hailed by attorney general dick thornburgh who 
said it recognizes the right and need of law enforcement officers 
to have lawful practical means of dealing with international drug 
trafficking operations 
this decision will clarify and assist our international 
cooperative law enforcement efforts particularly in overseas drug 
cases drug traffickers and terrorists will take no cheer from the 
courts opinion thornburgh said 
the us military is seeking to become more involved in fighting 
drug smuggling by using spy satellites and other surveillance 
techniques to track suspects in foreign countries 
the suspected drug smuggler in todays ruling rene verdugo 
urquidez was convicted in caifornia in 1988 of taking part in the 
1985 kidnapping torture and murder of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala 
avelar 
verdugo identified as a top lieutenant to reputed mexican drug 
kingpin rafael caro quintero is serving a sentence of 240 years 
plus life he is not eligible for parole for 59 years when he 
would be 96 
verdugos drug conviction and sentence in the killings were not 
at issue in the case decided today 
the search warrant issue arose in a separate although related 
prosecution 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals suppressed evidence 
obtained by the dea in its search of verdugos mexicali mexico 
home in 1988 
verdugo was arrested by mexican police in 1986 and was turned 
over to us authorities in california 
while he was awaiting trial the dea got the cooperation of 
mexican authorities to search the home the agents seized a tally 
sheet they said shows the quantities of marijuana smuggled into the 
united states by verdugo 
a federal judge in california ruled that the evidence is not 
admissible because the us agents failed to obtain a warrant in a 
us court 
the 9th circuit court upheld the judges decision saying us 
agents are not free to ignore the fourth amendment to the 
constitution that protects against unreasonable government searches 
the bush administration argued that the dea agents received 
assurances from mexican government officials that the search was 
lawful there without a warrant 
the dea said requiring warrants in such cases could hamper its 
campaign against drug smugglers it has offices in 45 nations in 
1988 alone it said it helped in investigations that led to 1200 
arrests of suspected drug smugglers in foreign countries 
the case is us vs verdugourquidez 881353

albuquerque nm journal on the nicaraguan election 
a decade after a bloody revolution deposed an oppressive 
dictator and swept a band of marxists into power a peaceful 
revolution at the ballot box transferred the reins of power from 
their hands to the people 
nicaragua held surprises this week opposition candidate now 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro the predicted loser 
proved that the science of precision polling is not even an art in 
nicaragua 
more surprising is the grace with which president daniel ortega 
seems to have met his rebuff by the voters 
sundays polling left its mark as an antifraud measure 
voters thumbs were marked with indelible green ink may those 
green thumbs indicate that after a long fallow season nicaraguans 
are growing a society that is as free and fair and productive as

st louis postdispatch on the nicaraguan election 
after almost 10 years of warfare and intense economic hardship 
the people of nicaragua have voted the sandinistas out 
the united states is indispensable to nicaraguas economic 
recovery the first step will be to stop supporting the contras 
that should mean that for the first time in years nicaraguans 
will not have to fear being killed by their countrymen so far 
30000 have died in the ussponsored guerrilla war 
but there must be more washington can supply desperately needed 
economic aid and end the trade embargo 
the reasons for president daniel ortegas defeat are 
undoubtedly numerous but a major one surely is that the people had 
been worn down by the tremendous hardship imposed on them by the 
reagan and bush administrations they knew that if sandinista rule 
ended ussponsored terrorism and economic deprivation would soon 
end 
president bush has proclaimed violeta barrios de 
chamorros election as a victory for democracy it is rather a 
victory for oppression us oppression the united states 
defeated the sandinistas at enormous cost to the people of 
nicaragua the united states too paid a high price it betrayed 
its own human and constitutional values as it sought to maintain 
hegemony in latin america 
now that the united states is about to have a government in 
managua that it approves of it has a serious moral obligation to 
undo the damage it has inflicted on that hapless country for so 
long and to try to restore its own self respect as well

the providence ri journalbulletin on the nicaraguan 
election 
what has often been forgotten should now be remembered the 
principal opponents of the sandinistas have not been onetime 
somoza henchmen but nicaraguans devoted to democratic change 
violeta barrios de chamorro whose husband was killed in the 
battle against somoza is the symbol of her countrys long struggle 
for freedom and in recent years its betrayal by the communist 
junta 
now with some timely assistance from the united states 
including we expect the lifting of economic sanctions 
nicaraguan democracy has air to breathe and plenty of room to grow

the crusading newspaper editors equally courageous widow 
violeta barrios de chamorro has won the presidency of nicaragua in 
the first free and democratic elections ever held there 
she did it against all the odds against a government that 
could marshal all the resources of a totalitarian state against 
her against the collective wisdom of friend and enemy alike that 
said there was no way she could win 
the nicaraguan people have shown that they want to live in 
democracy in peace and in freedom mrs chamorro said after her 
election 
whatever difficulties may lie ahead now at last theyll have 
that chance

the janesville wis gazette on the airline smoking ban 
starting sunday feb 25 virtually all airline flights in the 
united states became smokefree passengers now must wait as long 
as six hours for a smoke if they intend to fly the friendly skies 
its about time 
those of us who recognize the dangers of smoking both directly 
and as inhalers of secondary smoke should not have to put up with 
the smell of cigarettes while traveling in the muchtooclose 
confines of an airplane 
this commendable move is just the latest in a positive trend 
many workplaces are now completely offlimits to smokers so are 
lots of public buildings most restaurants also make accommodations 
that allow their diners to enjoy their meals without smelling 
someone elses smoke 
sure cigarette smokers should have the right to smoke that 
right however should never infringe on the much more important 
right of nonsmokers to breathe fresh air and avoid the medical 
risks posed by secondhand smoke

an important prosecution witness in a racial 
killing has been missing since the first of the year a district 
attorney confirmed today 
prosecutors will ask a judge to postpone a trial scheduled to 
begin next week unless witness john vento is found before then 
brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes said at a news 
conference 
however if vento is not found in a month the prosecution will 
go ahead without him hynes said he called vento important but not 
a key witness 
we have a trialready case hynes said im confident we 
have a substantial case 
vento told police he was one of the batwielding gang of young 
whites who confronted 16yearold yusuf hawkins and three other 
young blacks in the predominately white bensonhurst section of 
brooklyn unidentified sources told the daily news and new york 
newsday which initially reported ventos absence today 
hynes said prosecutors learned early in january from ventos 
family that he had taken off during the christmas holidays he 
said police and federal agents were looking for vento in upstate 
new york and in ohio but declined to elaborate 
joseph fama 18 is accused of firing the shot that killed 
hawkins 
vento accused joseph serrano 19 of handing the murder weapon 
to fama and has connected several other youths to the slaying the 
news reported 
unspecified charges against vento were dropped last year after 
he signed an agreement with former brooklyn district attorney 
elizabeth holtzman to testify the agreement said charges could be 
reinstated if he failed to take the stand

and so on and so on in all former president ronald reagan 
uttered that phrase at least 124 times while under oath during 
eight hours of testimony regarding his involvement in the 
irancontra affair a scandal that nearly destroyed his presidency 
the nations 40th president was testifying as a special defense 
witness in the trial of his former national security adviser john 
m poindexter 
now to be fair some of the events he was asked about occurred 
years ago 
also it is common for witnesses during depositions who cannot 
remember details precisely to claim i dont recall 
finally we must take into account that reagan is now 79 years 
old and that as president he was involved in thousands of meetings 
and millions of documents 
but he uttered i dont recall so many times it is certain to 
heighten suspicions of those who believe he is lying or trying to 
cover up details 
and mixed in between his memory lapses are denials of wrongdoing 
that are in conflict with the claims of poindexter who says he had 
presidential authorization for everything he did during the 
incident 
reagans testimony also did very little to alter the perception 
of him as a scripted actor dangerously detached from the presidency 
an executive who delegated far too much authority paid far too 
little attention to detail and was blind to serious crimes being 
committed around him 
its a pity that this man who stepped down from the most 
powerful office on earth a little more than a year ago and who now 
commands millions of dollars in speaking fees for his thoughts and 
memoirs is suffering such memory lapses 
it would be a much greater shame if the american people never 
learned the entire truth about this serious constitutional crime 
called irancontra

postbulletin rochester minn on reaganpoindexter 
it is hard to give a charitable interpretation of former 
president ronald reagans performance in his testimony in the case 
of john poindexter 
poindexter formerly director of the national security council 
under reagan is facing trial on charges of obstructing 
congressional inquiries into the sale of us arms to iran for 
providing support to the contras in nicaragua at a time when such 
support was banned by congress 
most of the former presidents answers consisted of i dont 
recall he used that reply about 100 times in the course of 
his videotaped deposition 
it would be easy to excuse the former president on the ground of 
his age except that his performance was consistent with his record 
during eight years as president 
there is no question that reagan was relaxed and detached as a 
chief executive we are now reaping the results of that sort of 
detachment in the savings and loan debacle the hud scandals the 
debt crisis and the trials of his former subordinates 
when histories of the 20th century are written calvin coolidge 
and warren harding may seem like astute and farsighted leaders 
compared to ronald reagan

the hudson dispatch union city nj on drugeating bugs 
the bush administration is working on a plan to develop 
caterpillars who love to chew on coca leaves if this all works 
out the insects could be scattered through the coca fields of 
latin america chewing up the raw materials for cocaine 
whether our good friends in latin america would welcome the 
prospect of millions of caterpillars dropping from the skies is a 
different matter 
since the drug bug cant solve our problems with narcotics 
production the united states might want to consider a different 
approach we could ship down a couple of thousand of those signs 
you see posted outside schools the ones that say drug free 
zone 
that might not have any effect on production of course but 
what effect has it had on consumption and it makes as much sense 
as a drugeating caterpillar

the keene nh sentinel on wall street greed 
in the days leading to the bankruptcy of drexel burnham lambert 
the managers of the new yorkbased investment house paid themselves 
more than 300 million in bonuses 
the bonuses are big but their actual sizes arent as important 
as knowing that unfortunately they reflect something a bit more 
permanent than drexel burnham lambert 
that something is the principle that a successful life to 
many people today is but a succession of transactions whose sole 
objective is to get rich and live rich if in the course of this 
pursuit people cause a company to fail or fall apart too bad 
thats darwin for you 
theres no way to regulate greed out of existence but we can do 
something about it 
we can teach our children that theres such a thing as 
overconsumption we can moderate our immediate needs and invest 
for the long haul we can return to a time when accumulation of 
wealth was merely a vehicle for building the economy not the 
absolute value it has become today

beaumont texas enterprise on the budget deficit 
the federal government is playing its hidethebudgetdeficit 
game with more than just the social security surplus money 
although social security provides the largest surplus by far more 
billions can be found in other fund accounts 
for example an airport trust fund financed by a tax on tickets 
will have a surplus of 76 billion by the end of fiscal year 1990 
the money is supposed to be used to improve frustratingly 
overcrowded airports and the dangerously overworked air traffic 
control system but the white house and congress allow the fund to 
accumulate because keeping the surplus on the books makes the 
budget deficit seem smaller 
and to top it off president bushs fiscal 1991 budget calls for 
increasing the tax on airline tickets to 10 percent from the 
current 8 percent 
it is outrageous to hit airline passengers with a 25 percent 
increase in the tax on tickets while the government refuses to 
spend the money it has now

the sun herald biloxi miss on us bases in the philippines 
in looking at military cutbacks all over the world the united 
states will be looking doubly hard at its six military 
installations in the philippines 
the us pours about 600 million into that part of the world 
about 500 million of that specifically to the philippines 
president corazon aquinos blatant snub of defense secretary 
dick cheney last week because of proposed reduction in us outlay 
to the philippines has even the most liberal americans gritting 
their teeth 
of course aquino may be posturing attempting a show of 
strength in the face of another coup attempt attempting to get 
more us dollars for her impoverished country attempting to prove 
she is not an american puppet even so the tactic could backfire 
the killing of an american and his family and antiamerican 
demonstrations in manila only add to questions about the wisdom of 
continued us presence there 
the philippines strategic geographic position and the 
tremendous investment we already have made in that country make us 
reluctant to pull out our 18000 military personnel and their 
dependents and we shouldnt pull out simply because of a snub 
but if we are going to make cutbacks around the world the first 
place we should consider packing up is where we are not welcome

the tribune san diego on an earlier california presidential 
primary 
with state lawmakers locked in partisan moves and countermoves 
the proposal to advance the date of californias june 
presidential primary may get lost in the shuffle 
thats too bad an early primary offers california a prime 
opportunity to have a say in who governs the nation 
think back to the 1988 presidential primary if the california 
primary had been held early enough to affect the process candidate 
george bush would have been forced to face a key issue offshore 
oil drilling 
poll after poll shows that california voters vehemently oppose 
risking our pristine shores to drill for questionable amounts of 
offshore oil candidate bush didnt have to worry by the time his 
campaign rolled west the golden state vote was irrelevant he 
could speak vaguely of a commitment to the environment but make no

legislators and a womens group 
criticized a judge for failing to imprison a royal marine commando 
who admitted he shot and killed his wife and baby boy for no 
apparent reason 
a jury found graham sherman 21 guilty of culpable homicide in 
the shotgun slaying of his wife michelle 23 and monthold son 
josh as they slept in their home in november 
but the 74yearold high court judge lord dunpark released 
sherman on tuesday without giving him a prison term or even 
probation saying you have punished yourself more than enough 
the sooner you try to forget this the better you have my deep 
sympathy 
legislator david evans of britains ruling conservative party 
said after the ruling this is a terrible decision 
bill walker the conservative party spokesman for defense 
matters in scotland said the judge was out of touch with the 
real world 
there has been growing criticism in recent years of court 
decisions in england where killers have escaped mandatory life 
sentences for murder after being convicted on the lesser charge of 
manslaughter this is the rough equivalent of culpable homicide in 
scotland which has a separate legal system 
the death penalty has been abandoned for murder throughout 
britain the penalty for manslaughter and culpable homicide is at 
the judges discretion in both legal systems 
the scottish womens aid group said in a statement the message 
of dunparks ruling was that the safety of women and children was 
not a priority 
it is a strange message to come from a courtroom that the 
crime of homicide can be purged by mental selfpunishment said 
brian wilson scottish spokesman for the opposition labor party 
legislator andrew welsh of the scottish national party called 
for dunpark to give a detailed explanation the judge may find he 
is out of line with public opinion on this he said 
dunpark told sherman the sentence was something i dont 
anticipate i will ever do again i am going to admonish you on 
both charges 
the judge said the purpose of sentencing is to punish and to 
deter others 
in my opinion you have punished yourself more than enough by 
what you did the judge said you will have to live with this 
for the rest of your life you dont know why you did it no one 
has been able to offer an explanation as to why you did it 
there was no deterrent value in a prison sentence the judge 
said for no one in their right mind would have killed without 
reason these two people who were dearest to them in the world 
but thats what you did theres no point in deferring 
sentence for good behavior you have no previous convictions 
neither is this a case in which in my opinion a probation order 
would help you it would just keep reminding you of what you have 
done 
and the sooner you try to forget this the better for all 
these reasons i admonish you on both these charges and you have my 
deep sympathy 
a letter sherman wrote to his sisterinlaw but never mailed 
was read in court saying i dont expect forgiveness nor do i 
expect anyone to understand why i have gone over it time and time 
again in my mind and i still cant find an answer 
you all know that i love michelle and josh with all my heart 
and believe me i still do

financially troubled shearson lehman hutton inc 
announced today it would cut another 2000 jobs from its payroll 
the investment firm announced the layoffs in a letter to 
employees late last year shearson said it was eliminating 800 
jobs to reduce expenses 
shearson president howard clark told employees the newest cuts 
which were expected to be completed during the first quarter were 
part of an expense reduction program that would save the company 
400 million a year 
clark said the costcutting plan and business review is 
expected to reduce firstquarter earnings because of onetime costs 
associated with the layoffs 
shearsons stock reacted positively to the cutbacks gaining 75 
cents to 1275 around midday on the new york stock exchange 
the layoffs would reduce shearsons current work force to 33500 
from a peak of 47000 shearson officials said the layoffs would 
occur in all areas at the firm including the firms corps of 
highly paid investment bankers 
todays announcement came two days after shearsons parent 
american express co said it would inject 750 million into its 
subsidiary to shore up its finances following a 250 million 
infusion in december in return american express increased its 
ownsership stake in shearson 
shearson has been hard hit by the slump in business on wall 
street profits at many wall street firms have been pressured by a 
drop in merger activity and securities underwriting and sluggish 
stock and bond trading since the october 1987 crash 
more than 40000 jobs have been cut from the industry during the 
slump 
shearson reported 1989 earnings of 110 million up from 96 
million a year earlier but a third of the profits came from the 
sale of a money management unit investment banking revenue which 
includes merger advising and securities underwriting was down 27 
percent 
the companys problems forced shearson chairman peter a cohen 
to resign in january 
many analysts believe shearson expanded too far too fast during 
the 1980s and now is paying the price besides laying off workers 
the company has been forced to cut broker commissions and shake up 
its senior management in an attempt to turn its balance sheet 
around 
shearson also is trying to stave off a downgrading of its credit 
ratings last fall moodys investors service inc said it was 
considering downgrading shearsons rating because of the firms low 
capital level weak profits and exposure to commercial real estate 
loans and investments as well as the overall securities industry 
slump

scientists have created a substance that blocks 
infection by viruses that cause colds a possible step toward drugs 
for preventing or treating the malady a study says 
a drug based on the manmade protein might be able to block or 
ease up to 45 percent of colds said coauthor steven marlin 
but he cautioned that the study was done in the test tube and 
that speculating on its meaning for a human cold is a huge leap 
the research based on a strategy that shows promise against the 
aids virus is presented in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature 
marlin did the study with colleagues at boehringer ingelheim 
pharmaceuticals inc of ridgefield conn and with researchers at 
the center for blood research in boston and the ernst boehringer 
institute in vienna austria 
their research focused on rhinoviruses which cause about half 
of common colds 
as a first step toward infecting cells many rhinoviruses attach 
themselves to a structure on the cell surface called the 
intercellular adhesion molecule1 or icam1 
for the new study scientists created a special form of icam1 
they hoped it would act as a decoy so that freefloating viruses 
would bind to it rather than their normal target on cell surfaces 
by this process researchers found the manmade icam1 was 
largely able to block rhinovirus infection of human cells in the 
test tube 
the result suggests that manmade icam1 or a similar substance 
might be able to prevent colds if given before infection marlin 
said scientists would have to do experiments in people to discover 
if such a substance would help ease a cold that has already 
started he said in a telephone interview 
the protein used in the study would have to be given as a nasal 
spray but it may give researchers leads for developing similar 
drugs that could be taken orally he said 
since natural icam1 plays a role in the bodys diseasefighting 
immune system scientists must determine how the presence of a 
manmade version would affect that system researchers said 
in an editorial accompanying the paper two british scientists 
cited some other hurdles such as showing in an animal that the 
strategy does any good 
such a drug would have to work in concentrations that can be 
maintained on the inner lining of the nose wrote charles bangham 
and andrew mcmichael of john radcliffe hospital in oxford 
marlin acknowledged that it might be difficult to maintain 
effective concentrations over a long period because the nose tends 
to expel substances quickly 
the british scientists also cautioned that the drug might cause 
an allergic reaction in the nose marlin said that might not be a 
serious problem because the manmade icam1 closely mimics its 
natural counterpart 
in research by other scientists a manmade version of a cellular 
structure called cd4 shows promise in blocking infection by the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome the 
experimental drug appears to be tolerated without serious side 
effects in people

president daniel ortega ordered a 
unilateral halt to all offensive military operations today and said 
the ussupported contra rebels should disband so nicaragua can 
peacefully change governments 
late tuesday presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro also 
told the hondurasbased rebels to lay down their weapons 
immediately 
in a statement issued by his press office ortega said the 
unilateral halt to military activity was aimed at encouraging the 
contras to demobilize quickly and quietly 
ortega also urged the honduran government to dismantle contras 
base camps near the nicaraguan border and asked the bush 
administration to end all us aid to them 
there were indications meanwhile that the transfer of power 
from ortegas leftist sandinistas to mrs chamorros usbacked 
coalition would be troubled as passions ran strong about what 
nicaraguas future should hold 
despite being trounced at the polls sunday by mrs chamorros 
coalition the sandinistas remain the countrys largest and most 
cohesive political force they control the military and police and 
have the allegiance of a large bureaucracy 
as transition talks got under way sandinista party members 
vowed never to let their revolution die 
the opposition coalition favors a freemarket economy but the 
sandinistas insisted tuesday that banks and industries stay in the 
hands of the state and that land seized by the government remain in 
peasant hands 
a change of government does not mean the end of the 
revolution ortega told a cheering crowd of thousands after a 
meeting of sandinista party leaders 
rafael solis a highranking military commander said the 
sandinistas would not cede control of the police or central 
americas largest army until the contras disband 
the top contra leader israel galeano said from tegucigalpa 
honduras tuesday the rebels would not disband until after mrs 
chamorro is inaugurated april 25 for a sixyear term 
officials in honduras estimate 10000 rebels and some 42000 
dependents are living in makeshift camps near the nicaraguan 
border president rafael leonardo callejas of honduras said that 
they must leave as soon as possible 
vice presidentelect virgilio godoy early today accused 
election officials of delaying the vote count in the national 
assembly races to fiddle with the results and deprive the 
opposition of the twothirds majority required to make 
constitutional changes 
the last time election results were announced monday afternoon 
with 82 percent of the vote reported the united national 
opposition uno had 55 percent of the vote to the sandinistas 41 
percent 
the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario estimated that 
under the proportional system uno would win 52 seats in the 
legislature short of the necessary twothirds it said the 
sandinistas would have 38 and the social christians one the 
assembly has at least 90 seats but any presidential candidate who 
gets more than a certain number of votes may also take a seat if 
they choose only ortega qualified for an extra seat but has not 
said if he will take it 
former president jimmy carter a mediator between the two 
groups said uno was concerned because the sandinista army is 
written into the constitution and the coalition would be several 
votes short of a majority needed to amend it 
control of military and police forces is considered the most 
delicate issue in the negotiations they are closely identified 
with the sandinista party and the army is known as the sandinista 
peoples army not the nicaraguan army 
uno has promised to eliminate the draft and reduce the size of 
the armed forces but the fractious amalgam of 14 parties and an 
indian organization spans the political spectrum from far right to 
far left and will need considerable muscle to stand up to the 
sandinistas 
a statement tuesday said the sandinistas who have ruled alone 
since overthrowing president anastasio somoza in 1979 would 
defend the integrity and professionalism of the army and the 
police forces 
the sandinistas said they still have the responsibility to 
watch over and guarantee the continuity of the revolutionary 
process 
in the statement they said their party would oppose any change 
in its agrarian reform and nationalization of banks and demanded 
jobs of all public workers be guaranteed 
solis the military commander said if uno decides to 
privatize the banking system it could be an irresponsible act that 
starts a war 
privatization is a fundamental part of unos economic program 
it hopes to reduce the public sector and return inefficient 
stateowned industries to the private sector to halt fourdigit 
inflation 
carter who held an initial meeting with both sides tuesday 
night said he was trying to help the parties define the issues and 
find a common ground 
he said before the meeting that humberto ortega and interior 
minister tomas borge in charge of police forces had agreed to 
give up their posts 
but it was unknown to what degree the sandinista rank and file 
would go along 
we will give up the government but not our weapons said 
one sandinista youth member lester rivera among 15000 sandinista 
loyalists at a downtown rally tuesday

atlantis rocketed into the nighttime 
sky after five postponements and carried a spy satellite into orbit 
today riding a dazzling 700foot column of fire seen for hundreds 
of miles 
after waiting out clouds and rain the shuttle lifted off at 
251 am sending brilliant light and a shock wave across the 
darkened seaside space center 
the craft carrying a fiveman allmilitary crew on a secret 
mission expected to last four days disappeared into clouds in just 
38 seconds leaving briefly a glow like a shrouded full moon 
two hours later nasa shut down public commentary about the 
classified mission and spokesman bruce buckingham said at midday 
today that silence meant all was well 
the fact that we havent heard anything indicates that all is 
going to according to plan said buckingham if something out 
of the ordinary takes place well be informed 
observers as far north as washington dc reported seeing the 
light of atlantis rockets as the craft followed a route never 
before taken by a shuttle 
nasa administrator dick truly congratulated the launch team 
noting it was a tough one to get off but a great job 
no comment was heard from atlantis astronauts and launch 
director bob sieck said at a news conference the crew was pretty 
quiet and very patient 
weather threatened a sixth delay of the mission and the launch 
first targeted for last thursday was in doubt until the final 
moments 
nasa halted the countdown for about two hours to wait for clouds 
and light rain to move through the countdown was restarted at nine 
minutes paused briefly for a final weather check then ticked 
smoothly on to lift off 
as the rocket ignited light burst from the launch pad and 
leaped from cloud to cloud as far as the eye could see water 
surrounding the pad was gilded with light from the brilliant 
cascade of fire powering atlantis 
the first two scheduled launches were halted by a combination of 
an astronauts illness and uncertain weather the third and fifth 
tries were blocked by bad weather and the fourth by a failed 
computer 
because of the payloads classified nature the national 
aeronautics and space administration kept secret the flight path 
but the shuttles orbit brought the ship up roughly parallel to the 
east coast giving residents a rare nighttime view of a spacebound 
shuttle 
theresa yohn news producer at wtlvtv in jacksonville fla 
watched the shuttle pass overhead for about 25 seconds from a 
window at the station some 150 miles north of the launch site 
it weaved in and out of the clouds said yohn it was 
beautiful very bright it had a long tail it looked like a bright 
falling star 
the light show was shorter at tybee island ga east of 
savannah 
it was almost like another star a white bright pinpoint of 
blue light that continued upwards said mike albertson assistant 
city editor of the savannah evening press it only lasted about 7 
to 10 seconds but it beat the hell out of a fireworks show 
atlantis according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity is carrying a 500 million satellite capable to taking 
highresolution photographs and listening in on electronic 
communications from all over the world 
its highinclination orbit is designed to carry it over far 
northern parts of the soviet union never before observed by a 
shuttlelaunched satellite the sources said 
that trajectory could play a role in monitoring arms agreements 
between the two countries the soviets have similar satellites over 
the united states 
because of the secret nature of the mission nasa blacked out 
public release of communications from the spacecraft and there was 
not a word heard from the crew on nasas public channels during the 
launch 
atlantis allmilitary crew is commanded by navy capt john o 
creighton the others are air force col john h casper the pilot 
and mission specialists marine lt col david c hilmers air force 
col richard m mullane and navy cmdr pierre j thuot 
sources said the mission is to last four days ending with a 
landing at edwards air force base in california

a package bomb exploded today in madrids 
main post office injuring two workers and police said they 
defused a letter bomb sent to a government prosecutor at the 
national court 
earlier this week two package bombs were sent to private homes 
and a court official was injured in one of the attacks 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks but 
a police spokesman said the basque separatist group eta was the 
main suspect because it has used package bombs in the past 
the explosions could delay renewed talks between eta and the 
government which said friday it would respond favorably to a 
sixmonth end to basque terrorist attacks 
police fearing more bombs ordered the evacuation of the post 
office after the explosion which scattered debris in a firstfloor 
sorting room 
doctors at gregorio maranon hospital said sorter maria del pilar 
fernandez was in serious condition with burns on her neck and face 
and injuries to both eyes another unidentified postal worker was 
taken to the hospital after the explosion deafened him in one ear 
doctors said 
later police defused a letter bomb discovered by a bodyguard of 
prosecutor eduardo fungairino a police official said 
fungairino investigated etas bloodiest action a june 1987 car 
bombing that killed 21 people in the parking garage of a barcelona 
department store 
on tuesday a package bomb exploded at the madrid home of 
fernando de mateo lage the president of the national court which 
tries all terrorist cases hospital officials today said the judge 
lost both hands and damaged his eyes in the blast 
also tuesday a bomb delivered to a retired army officer in 
valencia exploded without causing injuries 
interior minister jose luis corcuera said eta was the chief 
suspect in the attack on mateo lage in september eta gunmen 
assassinated antiterrorist prosecutor carmen tagle who worked at 
the same court 
it is obvious that eta is still mounting attacks against 
society and while there are attacks there will be no changes in 
antiterrorist policy corcuera said 
the package bomb that injured mateo lage was mailed on friday 
the same day corcuera said the government would respond favorably 
if the basque group halted attacks for six months 
eta has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people 
since it began its 21year violent campaign for independence for 
the northern threeprovince spanish basque region 
eta whose initials stand for homeland and liberty in the basque 
language claimed responsibility for attacks that killed 17 people 
last year etaclaimed actions have caused one death so far this 
year

heartconscious eaters who are fed up with lowfat 
diets can safely add some olive oil and other monounsaturated fats 
to their daily fare but the extra dose probably wont reduce their 
cholesterol a study concludes 
a second report has found that getting lots of potassium 
another nutrient with a wholesome image is no substitute for 
taking high blood pressure medicines 
scientists have been searching for foods that prevent disease 
rather than cause it and potassium and monounsaturated fats have 
been among the possible candidates two studies examining these 
substances were published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
some studies have suggested that foods high in monounsaturated 
fat such as olive oil actually might lower blood cholesterol 
levels however the new work found that while monounsaturated fats 
dont raise cholesterol they dont seem to lower it significantly 
dr henry n ginsberg and colleagues from columbia university 
randomly assigned 36 healthy young men to eat specially prepared 
meals for 10 weeks 
one group followed the american heart associations step 1 
diet in this regimen they limited their daily fat intake to 30 
percent of total calories ten percent of the calories wer from 
saturated fat 10 percent from polyunsaturated fat and 10 percent 
from monounsaturated fat 
a second group followed the same diet except that 18 percent of 
the daily calories were from monounsaturated fat the third group 
ate a standard american diet in which 18 percent of calories were 
from saturated fat 10 percent polyunsaturated and 10 percent 
monounsaturated 
when the study was over blood cholesterol levels had fallen 8 
percent in those who followed the heart association diet and 10 
percent in those who got extra monounsaturated fat 
the study did not enroll enough people to make a direct 
comparison between the two diets 
i can only conclude indirectly that both of the experimental 
diets were about the same ginsberg said what we hoped to do 
here was try to straighten out some misconceptions about monos 
that have arisen mostly from the media and food companies that 
they had some independent effect on lowering cholesterol 
he said the research suggests that people who give up saturated 
fat can safely replace it with monounsaturated fat but he noted 
that increasing consumption of carbohydrates is less fattening 
if you want to have more fat in your diet you can get away 
with it by substituting some monounsaturates for carbohydrates as 
long as you keep your saturated fat consumption low commented 
dr scott grundy of the university of texas southwestern medical 
center in dallas 
population studies have shown that groups with high levels of 
potassium in their diets also tend to have healthy blood pressures 
several small studies to check potassiums have produced 
conflicting results 
in the latest work dr richard h grimm jr and colleagues from 
the university of minnesota studied 287 middleage men who were 
already taking medicine for high blood pressure half were put on 
potassium and the rest receive placebos then their regular blood 
pressure medicines were withdrawn 
during the next two years the men continued taking the 
supplements either potassium or the dummies and followed 
lowsalt diets about half the people in both groups had to resume 
taking blood pressure pills because of rising blood pressure 
they said their work suggests that potassium supplementation 
does not reduce the need for antihypertensive medication of men on 
a lowsodium diet 
in an accompanying editorial drs norman m kaplan and c 
venkata s ram of southwestern medical center cautioned against 
discounting potassium entirely 
they noted that most of the men in the minnesota study were 
white and they raised the possibility that extra potassium may 
help black patients who are still on highsalt diets 
they also said they believe people should eat food that is 
naturally high in potassium the wisdom of nature honed by 
thousands of years of physiologic adaptations to a naturally high 
potassium intake should not be lightly dismissed they wrote

the sister of the longestheld western hostage in 
lebanon said today as she ended a pilgrimage to europe and the 
middle east that she believes the atmosphere is right for the 
release of all 18 captives 
i think that this is the beginning of the end said peggy 
say the sister of terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press 
there was almost if not 100 percent agreement among 
everybody that i talked to that the timing seems to be right she 
said in a british broadcasting corp television interview today 
it might not happen tomorrow it might not happen next week 
but when it happens i believe its going to be all of them and i 
would rather see all the hostages come out next month than see 
terry anderson come out today alone she said 
later mrs say met the archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
whose personal envoy terry waite is among the hostages waite 
disappeared jan 20 1987 while on a mission to beirut to try to 
free the captives 
at a news conference after the meeting mrs say recalled that 
she had met runcie and waite for the first time before waite went 
to beirut 
i must admit that i feel some responsibility and was just 
devastated when terry waite was kidnapped she said i continue 
to hope and to pray that when the hostages are released they all 
come out 
mrs say was concluding her 2week trip with a private dinner 
with the families of british hostages and the scottish relatives of 
american hostage thomas sutherland 
she is especially hopeful because she believes that for the 
first time since anderson was seized nearly five years ago the 
three key nations the united states syria and iran are 
working together to try to free the hostages 
there had to be the us syria and iran it had to be a 
cooperative effort and i feel that it is given that nothing 
happens to interfere with it she said in an interview tuesday 
night weve got all the components here given that everything 
stays on track i feel it will end as other people say to me 
sooner rather than later 
she praised the us government for its efforts 
i did not have to worry about pressuring my own government to 
use its influence in a positive way mrs say told nbcs 
today show everywhere i went they assured me that that was 
being done and thatsquite different from whats happened in the 
past 
anderson was kidnapped in west beirut on march 16 1985 a 
proiranian group called islamic jihad or islamic holy war claims 
to hold him 
five years seems to have triggered something in people said 
mrs say on tuesday 
it seems everybody is realizing that these hostages are 
becoming a real obstacle that they are preventing a move 
forward between the united states and other countries and that 
obstacle has to be removed so they can get on to other things 
she said 
mrs say said she was encouraged by a commentary last week in 
the tehran times which usually reflects the thinking of president 
hashemi rafsanjani that the hostages should be freed and by a 
statement sunday from irans chief justice mohammad yazdi that 
islam opposed hostagetaking 
mrs say was also heartened by an appeal for a new approach to 
free the hostages made friday by sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
the most influential shiite moslem cleric in lebanon he is the 
spiritual guide to the iranianaligned hezbollah or party of god 
which is believed to be an umbrella organization for groups holding 
most of the hostages 
a report tuesday in alhayat an arab newspaper published in 
london that contacts in geneva among the united states syria and 
iran were making progress on the hostage issue was one of many 
many positive signals she said 
the white house and state department on tuesday denied reports 
of secret talks in geneva 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater did not rule out 
that the hostage issue was under discussion stressing there were 
no facetoface negotiations 
mrs say said shes hoped and prayed for the last few years 
that when a hostage release comes its part of something larger 
maybe a recementing or a reaffirming of our relationship with 
syria opening the door for dialogue with iran moving toward a 
settlement in the region 
if that happened if these hostages are a part of that i 
dont begrudge the pain and i know terry anderson would not it 
would have been worth every day that weve all suffered ive 
prayed that it wont happen for nothing

in advance daniel oretegas triumph at the 
polls last sunday the one that didnt come about seemed 
inevitable 
polls conducted by american outfits showed him a landslide 
winner but that didnt take into account the distrust ordinary 
nicaraguans might have had for strangers with clipboards asking 
questions 
the washington postabc news poll had ortega leading violeta 
barrios de chamorro by 48 percent to 32 percent with the rest 
scattered undecided or unwilling to declare themselves a poll 
conducted for the spanishlanguage television network univsion had 
ortega winning by an even bigger landslide 53 percent to 35 
percent 
when nicaraguans voted sunday they turned those polls on their 
heads mrs chamorro won overwhelmingly 5541 percent catching 
pollsters analysts and commentators off guard surprising her 
opponents and herself the postmortem search for an explanation 
has been under way ever since 
in advance mrs chamorro had been portrayed as a loser 
disorganized offering no articulate solutions to nicraguas woeful 
problems leading a splintered coalition slowed down by a knee 
injury which put her on crutches 
it was said that the 18 million in aid offered her campaign by 
the united states had only stirred resentment among nicaraguans 
and the panama invasion was pictured as another impediment 
even secretary of state james l baker iii seemed to have caught 
the ortegacantlose bug asked at a congressional hearing last 
thursday about us policy if ortega won baker said we 
shouldnt assume this then he went on to assume it and laid out 
tough terms for ortega to meet before normal relations could be 
restored 
many network newscasts left little room for doubt 
said nbcs ed rabel from managua on feb 21 over a picture of 
ortega this is the man pollsters say who will be elected 
overwhelmingly this weekend the election observers say the 
bush administration may have itself to blame for daniel ortegas 
rise in popularity among the votes the reason they say is the 
us military invasion in panama it was a close race until the 
us invaded 
almost certainly said ted koppel of abc two nights later 
the sandinistas will still win 
in the postmortems a single explanation was often offered 
american polling outfits made a fatal mistake in assuming that 
nicaraguans would tell strangers how they would vote 
many of the people we interviewed in nicaragua were simply 
unwilling to allow themselves to be identified as an enemy of the 
sandinista government says rob schroth of bendixen amp schroth 
which took the univision poll 
howard schuman director of the university of michigan survey 
research center and a member of the commission on nicaragua 
preelection polls cautioned when the abc newswashington post 
poll came out that difficulties in sampling in rural areas probably 
made for a largerthannormal margin of error 
in addition he said this week my guess is that at least one 
component of the polls failures is that people did not answer 
frankly the question is how much they trusted that their answers 
would be treated confidentially 
added mark penn a pollster who has worked widely in latin 
america but stayed away from nicaragua polling is a device that 
is useful in a stable democracy but in a place where there is no 
history of democracy it is unreliable 
schroth noted that all the polls werent wrong those by 
organizations from venezuela argentina and costa rica put mrs 
chamorro in the lead the washington post said that of 27 polls 
released in 1989 and this year 14 showed the sandinistas ahead and 
13 gave the lead to mrs camorros coalition 
some analysts say in retrospect that those expecting an ortega 
victory overlooked nicaraguas economic pains 
and one pollster stanley greenberg of greenberglake 
associates says ortega booted it 
he conducted a glitzy americanstyle campaign and it 
backfired said greenberg whose own polls for hemisphere 
initiative an observer group were just as wrong as the other 
american polls 
ortega put himself in a losing proposition greenberg said by 
asking voters to choose between his own austere personality and 
mrs chamorros warmth 
but once the sandinista campaign centered on the cult of 
personality once the advertising was rock music and the youth 
culture i wonder if the campaign didnt trivalize the issues 
greenburg said 
laurence birns executive director of the council on hemispheric 
affairs a liberal research group critical of us policy toward 
nicaragua also stressed the economic issue 
no government associated with hyperinflation is going to win 
an election he said but like others birns miscalculated he 
had predicted a narrow sandinista win

space shuttle atlantis aloft at 
last on a secret military mission after five launch delays orbited 
the globe wednesday in a public silence that nasa officials said 
meant all was well 
atlantis blasted off with five military astronauts and a cargo 
believed to be a 500 million spy satellite at 251 am its 
700foot column of fire visible for hundreds of miles it was 
nasas sixth attempt at launching the 100ton spaceship for the 
mission one short a record for the most shuttle postponements 
thank goodness we can finally stop meeting like this nasa 
administrator richard truly told the launch team after atlantis 
rocketed into orbit it was a tough one to get off but a great 
job 
nothing was heard from atlantis allmilitary crew and launch 
director bob sieck said the crew was pretty quiet and very 
patient 
the fact that we havent heard anything indicates that all is 
going according to plan added bruce buckingham a spokesman for 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
because of the classified nature of the defense department 
mission nasa quickly blacked out public release of communications 
from the shuttle for the entire trip 
liftoff originally set for feb 15 almost was delayed a sixth 
time because of bad weather at kennedy space center and at 
emergency abort sites 
the first scheduled liftoff was halted when the crews commander 
was stricken with a cold his illness combined with uncertain 
weather prompted nasa to scrub the second launch 
the others were blocked twice by bad weather and once by a 
malfunctioning computer 
with rain and clouds threatening to postpone once more nasa 
halted wednesdays countdown for about two hours the clock was 
restarted at nine minutes paused briefly for a final weather 
check then ticked to liftoff 
the weather finally cooperated we had a good smooth count 
said forrest mccartney director of kennedy space center the 
team exercised good patience 
as the rocket ignited light burst from the launch pad and 
leaped form cloud to cloud across the nighttime horizon 
people as far north as washington dc reported seeing the 
blue white and red light of atlantis rockets as the spaceship 
streaked up the east coast on the highest inclination orbit ever 
traveled by a shuttle for many it resembled a brilliant falling 
star 
it only lasted about seven to 10 seconds but it beat the hell 
out of a fireworks show said mike albertson an editor at the 
savannah ga evening press who watched from tybee island ga 
atlantis 62degree inclination puts it over far northern parts 
of the soviet union never before observed by a shuttlelaunched 
satellite the spy satellite on board is capable of taking 
highresolution photographs and listening in on electronic 
communications from around the world according to sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the mission is expected to last 4 days and end with a landing 
at edwards air force base in calif sources said 
atlantis crew is commanded by navy capt john o creighton the 
others are air force col john h casper the pilot and mission 
specialists marine lt col david c hilmers air force col

labels on meat and poultry products will have 
to be more specific when certain flavorings are used the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
federal rules are being changed effective march 1 to require 
proteinaceous material derived from livestock poultry eggs 
milk plants and yeast to be listed on labels by their names 
in the past such substances could be listed simply as 
flavorings or similar terms 
for example a popular flavor agent or enhancer used for 
years in hot dogs will have to be labeled milk protein 
hydrolyzate 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said the new rule which was 
proposed in august 1987 was adopted to better protect the 
public health and serve the consumers right to know whats in 
food products 
for many years the agency has required labels for meat and 
poultry products to list all ingredients he said however an 
exception was made to allow natural flavoring and similar terms 
to designate substances which are often added as flavor enhancers 
emulsifiers stabilizers binders extenders and nutrient sources 
in products such as frankfurthers and bologna 
crawford said the exception was allowed because the additives 
were primarily flavorings in meat and poultry products and did not 
make a significant nutritional contribution 
but he said the agencys paramount concern is public health 
and that it was found some people can have severe allergic 
reactions to these substances 
the agency is also concerned about a marked increase in the 
use of these ingredients during the last decade crawford said 
some manufacturers may be using the substances inappropriately as 
lowcost meat replacements 
now he said consumers with allergies to certain substances can 
tell if the product contains those ingredients 
crawford said meat and poultry processors will be allowed to 
make label changes over six months although the agency is working 
closely with the companies to speed it up 
at least one company is adding a stick on label to its 
regular packaging to further define the product ingredients he 
said

a prosecutor today ruled out criminal charges 
against the rev bruce ritter saying an investigation into 
allegations of financial impropriety against the covenant house 
founder had not turned up enough to warrant prosecution 
ritter also a target of allegations of sexual improprieties 
resigned tuesday night as director of the network of shelters for 
runaways he founded in 1968 
district attorney robert morgenthau said there were some 
questionable financial transactions discovered in the review of 
expenditures in behalf of kevin kite a former male prostitute who 
claimed he had sex with ritter in return for material favors he 
declined to be more specific but said the problems uncovered were 
insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution 
morgenthau also said violations of law may have occurred when 
covenant house supplied kite with false identification papers in 
the name of a dead child he said he had decided not to bring 
charges in that matter either after consultation with the family 
of the dead child 
a separate investigation by the state attorney generals office 
is continuing 
since december four young men who took shelter at covenant 
house have accused ritter in news reports of having affairs with 
them prosecutors were studying whether any funds raised by the 
charity were misused 
the district attorney said covenant house officials had 
cooperated in the investigation and nothing was discovered that 
cast doubt on the merit of its programs 
although covenant house has had to endure a brief period of 
adversity i am confident that it will emerge from this episode a 
stronger and more effective organization which continues to deserve 
widespread public support morgenthau said 
in resigning at a board meeting tuesday night ritter said the 
sex misconduct allegations made it impossible for me to lead 
covenant house effectively he said he didnt want to jeopardize 
the wellbeing of the thousands of young people covenant house 
serves 
the controversy that has surrounded me for the past three 
months has made it impossible for me to lead covenant house 
effectively ritter said in a statement 
therefore after a great deal of thought and prayer i have 
come to the conclusion that in the best interest of covenant house 
and most especially for the wellbeing of thousands of street 
kids i should resign 
former city schools chancellor frank macchiarola who served as 
acting president of covenant house while the allegations were 
investigated also resigned 
james j harnett executive vice president and chief operating 
officer will replace ritter until a permanent successor is found 
the focus has got to be on the needs of the kids harnett 
said covenant house is not one man its not me its not father 
ritter he was not all of covenant house but his vision his 
courage and determination remain 
harnett said the controversy has been very upsetting to the 
kids and the kids are going to be very upset by ritters decision 
to leave 
the charges against ritter 62 arose in december when the new 
york post quoted kite as saying he had had an affair with ritter 
last year three more men have since said they had affairs with 
ritter 
ritter who is accustomed to laudatory coverage and was once 
hailed by president reagan as a hero called the accusations 
garbage 
the roman catholic priest started covenant house by putting up 
runaways in his apartment it now serves 25000 youths annually at 
17 shelters in the united states canada and latin america nearly 
all of its 85 million annual budget comes from donations 
contributions to covenant house were said to have fallen off 
since the allegations against ritter surfaced 
macchiarola named acting president feb 7 said in a statement 
he resigned after covenant houses board rejected his proposal for 
the organizations future his spokeswoman maureen connelly said 
macchiarola had wanted to conduct reviews investigations and 
audits of current practices and make changes 
harnett said the board accepted all of those recommendations 
and plans to hire consultants to revamp procedures but he said the 
board disagreed with macchiarola on who was best qualified to 
replace ritter

secretary of state james a baker iii on 
wednesday proposed a thaw in us relations with new zealand 
chilled in recent years by disagreements over american nuclear 
policy 
i dont think it makes sense to continue a ban on highlevel 
contacts on matters other than military or intelligence baker 
told the senate budget committee 
he observed that the two countries share similar positions on 
combating drug trafficking and in opposing driftnet fishing in the 
pacific 
it is shortsighted baker said i am prepared to resume 
contacts with my counterpart in new zealands government 
the united states in 1986 suspended highlevel contacts with new 
zealand and froze new zealand out of the anzus alliance which also 
includes the united states and australia 
the move followed new zealands denial of docking rights for 
us military vessels unless they carried no nuclear weapons the 
united states in line with its standard policy refused to confirm 
or deny whether such weapons were aboard its ships 
david lange of new zealands labor party came to power in july 
1984 after making a campaign promise to ban nuclearpowered or 
nucleararmed us naval vessels from the countrys waters the 
reagan administration accused the government of undermining the 
alliances nuclear deterrent

drug enforcement administration chief john c 
lawn is resigning after five turbulent years as director of the 
lead federal antidrug agency and will become an executive with 
the new york yankees the dea said today 
theres no suggestion that hes giving up the war on drugs 
agency spokesman frank shults said of lawn hes very torn 
it was an extremely difficult decision for him to make 
lawn has accepted an offer from yankees owner george 
steinbrenner to become vice president and chief of operations for 
the baseball organization shults said 
he will handle all matters pertaining to the new york yankees 
except for the players shults said 
lawn and steinbrenner met in 1987 when they were on a speaking 
panel together and lawn is a close personal friend of phil mcniss 
a retired fbi agent who is vice president of steinbrenners 
american shipbuilding co the spokesman said 
the dea chief was a basketball coach when he taught english and 
american hisstory at brooklyn preparatory school a jesuit school 
for seven years before beginning his law enforcement career shults 
said lawn was named high school coach of the year for new york 
city in 1964 he said 
his move to the yankee organization was reported first by the 
washington post scripps howard news service and newsday 
shults said tuesday that one reason behind the former marine 
corps officers decision to retire march 23 after 27 years of 
government service is that he will turn 55 in a few months 
as a presidential appointee lawn is exempt from the mandatory 
retirement age of 55 imposed on other federal law enforcement 
officers however he would not be able to maintain his position 
as a law enforcement officer just an administrator shults said 
its extremely important to him that he is a special agent 
thats his motivation 
my service as administrator of dea over the past five years 
has been most rewarding and most satisfying lawn said in a 
letter to president bush 
the ratification of the united nations convention the 
national drug control strategy and the cartagena summit have 
established the foundations upon which we can project with 
confidence our ultimate success in this battle 
lawn also thanked bush for his personal involvement in 
honoring those dea special agents who have paid the ultimate price 
in this battle 
in an interview in december lawn said the loss of personnel was 
the toughest part of his job 
his tenure began with one of the most traumatic events in the 
agencys history the kidnapping torture and slaying of dea agent 
enrique kiki camarena and his mexican pilot alfredo zavala 
avelar 
lawns role in badgering mexican officials to pursue who was 
behind the killings was portrayed in a recent television 
miniseries drug wars the camarena story 
lawn gave no hint in that december interview that he might be 
retiring soon saying he would like to keep his job until i 
become tired of it 
he acknowledged that the job was frustrating and challenging 
part of the frustration stemmed from the size of the drugwar 
budget he contrasted the 95 billion to be spent in 1990 to the 
excess of 30 billion a year the united states spent to wage 
the vietnam war 
to have fewer agents than there are musicians in the united 
states army or to have fewer agents than there are new york city 
transit police you get a sense of too few people being asked to 
face a herculean challenge lawn said 
last month bush requested a 106 billion budget for the war on 
drugs in 1991 which would boost deas share from 6169 million 
this year to 7913 million next year enough to add several 
hundred agents to the current complement of 3191 
when lawn took over in 1985 the dea budget was 3538 million 
and there were 2430 agents 
jack lawn has provided extraordinary leadership to the drug 
enforcement administration during an extremely challenging time 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
he has been a catalyst for leadership in the international law 
enforcement community helping to unite the drugfighting efforts 
of many countries his contributions to the international war 
on drugs will be missed 
lawn joined the fbi in 1967 and was named dea acting deputy 
administrator in 1982 president reagan nominated him to the top 
dea job in 1985 to replace francis m mullen who had retired

the government released 22 people 
convicted of spying for north korea under a special amnesty 
wednesday 
seouls main intelligence agency meanwhile said two korean 
residents of japan had been arrested on espionage charges 
among those released in the amnesty was so sung 44 a former 
korean resident of japan who was serving a 20year sentence for 
spying for communist north korea 
sos case gained international attention after he tried to 
commit suicide during a police interrogation in 1971 some 
international human rights groups including the washingtonbased 
asia watch had called for his release saying the charges against 
him were exaggerated 
the government amnesty was announced to mark the anniversary of 
the march 1 1919 korean uprising against japanese colonial rule 
i am glad to be released but we must pay attention to 
political prisoners not released yet so said after his release 
from prison in the central city of taejon 
so who was studying at a seoul university at the time of his 
arrest in 1971 denied passing sensitive military information to 
north korea 
so attempted suicide by dousing himself with kerosene and 
plunging into a burning stove while being interrogated doctors 
saved his life but his face was badly deformed by burns 
so said he tried to kill himself because he could not bear the 
torture during his interrogation 
south korean authorities said so traveled to north korea twice 
between 1968 and 1970 and was a member of north koreas communist 
party 
he received a life sentence in 1973 which was later commuted to 
20 years 
the agency for national security planning formerly known as the 
korean central intelligence agency identified the two arrested 
korean residents of japan as suh soontaek 61 and his older 
brother suh sooneun 64 
the agency did not indicate when the brothers were arrested but 
said they had collected military economic and political 
information for north korea from the early 1960s until january of 
this year 
if convicted they could be sentenced to death 
the brothers set up a seoul business firm as a cover and had 
contacts with many influential politicians and army generals who 
served under the late president park chunghee in the 1970s the 
agency said 
the agency said the younger suh was recruited by a north korean 
agent in tokyo and then persuaded his older brother to spy for 
north korea

legislators overwhelmingly approved a bill 
wednesday that allows soviets to acquire land and bequeath it to 
their children a major modification of decades of state control of 
land 
the law however stops short of legalizing full private 
ownership of property by strictly forbidding the sale of land 
under the new law plots only can be leased and the lease prices 
will be set by the state 
the measure was part of a comprehensive package designed to give 
the force of law to the economic and social reforms championed by 
president mikhail s gorbachev the official news agency tass 
called it a major legal document of soviet economic reform 
the law is to serve as the basis for further legislation by each 
republic to regulate land distribution 
state ownership of land inscribed in the soviet constitution 
has been a cornerstone of communism since the 1917 revolution but 
reformers and economists repeatedly have called for allowing 
private ownership as a way of spurring growth in the troubled 
economy 
in a commentary in wednesdays edition of the newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda economist pavel voshchanov welcomed the 
reform as a first step to reversing a situation in which the soviet 
union with some of the richest farmland on earth has become a net 
importer of food 
the soviet constitution says the land its minerals waters 
and forests are the exclusive property of the state the congress 
of peoples deputies the supreme soviets parent body will be 
asked to change the constitution when it meets march 12 
by altering the constitution and allowing the roughly 23 million 
people employed on the 26000 collective and 23000 state farms to 
acquire plots the kremlin leadership hopes to raise farm 
productivity which is notoriously low on those farms 
rural families already produce onefourth of the countrys gross 
agricultural production including nearly 30 percent of the meat 
milk and eggs on individual plots they are allowed to exploit 
in a poll published wednesday in the newspaper izvestia 40 
percent of those queried said they were eager to become individual 
farmers 
the supreme soviet legislature first voted separately on each 
chapter of the 52article measure then approved the entire law 
3497 with 12 abstentions the full congress of peoples deputies 
must now approve it 
wednesdays fourhour session was the third time the supreme 
soviet considered the proposed socalled law on land during 
earlier debate about 150 proposals and criticisms of the bill were 
made 
alexander nikonov the president of the soviet agricultural 
academy who submitted the bill said about 40 percent of the 
original draft had been revised to accommodate the proposed changes 
the law states that land is the property of the people living on 
a given territory and that every soviet citizen has the right to a 
piece of land 
according to the law land can be distributed by the kolkhoz a 
state collective farm or by the local city council in the case of 
city dwellers or others who desire to hold land religious groups 
also have the right to acquire land 
however land is not actually purchased but leased and is 
subject to taxes lease prices will be set by the state and sale of 
the plot will be strictly forbidden the law says 
the land can be bequeathed to the holders children but the 
children would not be allowed to divide the plot and the land can 
be revoked if the state determines that it has not been utilized in 
a rational way or if the holder seriously pollutes it 
under the law foreigners also are not allowed to purchase land 
as they are in some parts of eastern europe that is bound to 
hinder development of joint ventures where the foreign firm is 
seeking security for a factory or agricultural enterprise 
during wednesdays debate one supreme soviet deputy said the 
law did not help move the soviet union toward a market economy 
since it did not allow for the transfer of land from one citizen to 
another 
but most the debate concerned minor changes in wording 
another law regulating private property is still in committee 
for revision 
daspite the limitations the law approved wednesday represents a 
major step forward in wresting control of the land from the state 
the bolsheviks nationalized all land in 1918 taking away 
holdings from many city dwellers peasants were allowed to stay on 
the land until the late 1920s when stalin began the brutal policy 
of forcing them onto collective farms 
millions of peasants died of famine as a result of the 
collectivization plan which placed nearly 95 percent of peasant 
holdings in state hands by the mid1930s most historians and 
economists agree the policy crippled soviet agriculture 
on tuesday the legislature approved by wide margin the creation 
of a vastly stronger soviet presidency an office gorbachev is 
widely expected to hold 
the lawmakers also convened the 2250member congress of

president vaclav havel on 
wednesday praised the frankness of his meetings with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and president bush following visits to 
washington and moscow 
havel also said he would travel to france and britain on march 
19 for talks with french president francois mitterrand and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
i always felt gorbachev was a bit of a dictator the way i saw 
him on television shouting at the congress and making his little 
jokes havel said in reality he is a very modest shy and nice 
man who knows how to listen to you and you dont see that in 
politics very often i liked him 
havel desribed bushs ideas as extremely interesting adding 
they had unusually many points of agreement during their talks 
in washington 
comparing the two visits havel said that although his us trip 
was more hectic the atmosphere was the same the same mood of 
friendly welcome and surprise 
havel said his proposal that the two superpower leaders hold a 
summit meeting in prague this year after they meet in washington 
was received with great interest by both of them and they made an 
impression as if they would like it to take place in prague 
also on wednesday the state ctk news agency reported that a 
former top communist party official suspected of asking warsaw pact 
troops to invade in 1968 has been charged with crimes punishable by 
up to 10 years in prison 
former politburo member vasil bilak accused of abuse of 
political power was one of the party officials generally thought 
to have invited the five sovietled armies of the warsaw pact into 
czechoslovakia in august 1968 to crush the prague spring 
reforms bilak has denied wrongdoing 
ctk said the federal prosecutor had asked his czech counterpart 
the country is made up of the czech lands and slovakia to 
investigate the case 
prosecution proceedings on grounds of suspicion of abuse of 
power of a public official were already initiated said the news 
agency 
bilak 72 is a veteran communist hardliner who retired before 
the peaceful revolution toppled milos jakes last year 
bilak was expelled from the party on dec 21 and is one of two 
former top party officials being prosecuted the other is miroslav 
stepan in custody on identical charges

states may make the death penalty the only 
possible punishment for some murderers without violating the 
constitutions ban on mandatory death sentences the supreme court 
ruled wednesday 
by a 54 vote the court upheld pennsylvanias death penalty 
system despite some mandatory aspects 
the decision removed a threat to similar laws in 13 other 
states arizona california connecticut idaho illinois 
maryland montana new jersey ohio oregon tennessee texas and 
washington 
most states have death penalty laws but many of them do not 
resemble the pennsylvania scheme 
past supreme court rulings have struck down state laws making 
death the mandatory punishment for specific crimes such as killing 
a police officer or for specific offenders such as prison inmates 
already serving life sentences when they commit murder 
those decisions said the eighth amendments ban on cruel and 
unusual punishment requires that sentencing judges or juries be 
allowed to consider aggravating and mitigating factors 
but pennsylvania law says the verdict must be a sentence of 
death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating 
circumstance and no mitigating circumstance 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the law does not make death mandatory despite its 
mandatorysounding language 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
death is not automatically imposed upon conviction for certain 
types of murder rehnquist said it is imposed only after a 
determination that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the 
mitigating circumstances present in the particular crime committed 
by a particular defendant or that there are no such mitigating 
circumstances 
he added the constitutionality of a death penalty statute 
having some mandatory aspects is not a novel issue for this court 
but justice william j brennan writing for the dissenters said 
the decision lets states bar juries from deciding that one 
particular aggravating circumstance is not enough to warrant a 
death penalty 
today for the first time the court upholds a statute 
containing a mandatory provision that gives the legislature rather 
than the jury the ultimate decision whether the death penalty is 
appropriate brennan said 
he was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens 
the pennsylvania law was challenged by scott wayne blystone one 
of more than 100 death row inmates awaiting execution in the state 
blystone was convicted of the sept 13 1983 murder of 
hitchhiker dalton smithburger jr in fayette county pa 
blystone drove to an isolated area told smithburger to get out 
robbed him of 13 and fired six shots at pointblank range into his 
head 
the only aggravating circumstance found by the sentencing jury 
was that blystones murder accompanied a robbery he did not submit 
any evidence to mitigate the crime 
the case is blystone vs pennsylvania 886222

a drug used to prevent epileptic seizures can 
lose a third of its effectiveness if stored in humid conditions 
according to study results released wednesday by the food and drug 
administration 
the results prompted the fda to renew its advice that drugs be 
stored in a cool dry place 
the fda is asking manufacturers of the epilepsy drug 
carbamazepine to change their packaging of the drug to keep out 
moisture users of the drug should keep their supplies tightly 
closed in a dry location away from bathrooms showers and 
humidifiers the agency said 
the studies may help explain why some patients taking 
carbamazepine have complained that the drugs ability to prevent 
seizures varies the fda said 
the research conducted at fda laboratories in washington and in 
fdafunded studies at the university of tennessee college of 
pharmacy in memphis found that when carbamazepine tablets were 
exposed to humidity they hardened and then dissolved poorly in 
test liquids 
blood samples from volunteers who took the drug confirmed that 
carbamazepine tablets that dissolved poorly in lab tests also were 
absorbed poorly by the body when the drug is absorbed poorly it 
is less effective 
the tests did not involve chewable tablets or the drugs liquid 
form 
carbamazepine is sold under the brand name tegretol by 
cibageigy corp and under more than 15 generic labels

existing home sales declined 22 percent in 
january as rising mortgage interest rates combined with the usual 
winter lull to brake sales to their slowest pace since last summer 
a real estate trade group said wednesday 
the national association of realtors said resales of 
singlefamily homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 348 million 
units in january compared to 356 million one month earlier it 
was the slowest pace since last augusts 344 million rate 
john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist said he did not 
see a big increase in existing home sales in the near future but 
added that as rates taper off in the spring we expect sales to 
pick up 
surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp show that 
fixedrate 30year mortgages rose from 983 percent to 1005 
percent during january 
the rate rise in january made a dent in highend and 
lessexpensive markets said realtors president norman d flynn 
who also noted that the start of a new year is a slow homesales 
period 
the housing market has been hurt by the federal reserves high 
interest policies designed to stem inflation by slowing the 
economy existing home sales dropped to a 325 million rate last 
may when mortgage rates were still near their peak 
the commerce department is scheduled to release on friday its 
report on new home sales in january 
the realtors survey found the median price of an existing home 
to be 96200 up 4 percent from december and 71 percent from 
january 1989 the median means half of the homes cost more half 
less 
the only increase in resales occurred in the south where 140 
million units were sold on an annual rate up 07 percent from 
december the median price there was 86300 
sales in the west where the median price was 144000 suffered

the brother of nicolae ceausescu will 
stand trial in the shooting deaths of seven people during 
antigovernment riots that led to the overthrow of the communist 
dictator it was reported wednesday 
in an interview with the independent daily newspaper adevarul 
prosecutor general gheorghe robu said nicolae andruta ceausescu a 
lieutenant general in the securitate secret police would stand 
trial for the shooting deaths which occurred in front of the 
former communist party headquarters dec 21 a day before his 
brother was toppled 
the securitate officially was disbanded in the days following 
the revolution on the day of the confrontation nicolae andruta 
ceausescu had under his command 1000 securitate officers armed 
with 350000 bullets adevarul quoted robu as saying 
he tried to convince the officers to shoot but they would 
not even when he threatened them with the execution robu said 
witnesses confirm that he ran around shouting at his men shoot 
them kill these dogs 
the daily quoted one of ceausescus men as saying he ran 
among us shouting like a wild animal but no one actually believed 
he would shoot these young people he did this with a cruelty that 
i wouldnt have expected 
the dictators son nicu a former communist party regional 
secretary and daughter zoiaelena a former mathematics 
researcher also are awaiting trial on various charges the 
newspaper gave no trial dates 
news of the pending trials was made public as romania and its 
historic rival hungary agreed to set up an exchange program for 
military officers and cadets to try to lessen tensions 
in a communique the nations also agreed to create a commission 
to resolve historical disputes between the two countries 
the neighbors have been at odds for centuries over transylvania 
now part of romania but ruled for centuries by hungary tensions in 
recent years have focused on mistreatment of romanias hungarian 
minority under ceausescu and disagreements have resurfaced after 
the revolution 
the accords followed a visit by hungarian defense minister 
ferenc karpati who met his romanian counterpart victor anastase 
stanculescu and premier petre roman on improving bilateral 
relations 
in a news conference at the hungarian embassy stanculescu 
thanked hungary for being the first country to offer its 
help to the romanian army which supported the revolution 
also wednesday the official rompres news agency published a 
defense ministry breakdown on the makeup of the securitate 
the ministry said the new security organization being set up 
would not be used for repression or intimidation 
the composition and fate of the securitate has been a major 
question since the uprising with the belief that it continues to 
exist publication of the defense ministry statistics appeared to 
be an attempt to dispel those fears 
the newly created bodies will not carry out repressive actions 
in any situation the statement said 
the statement issued in the name of stanculescu asserted that 
the new agency which he has likened to the fbi in the united 
states would not listen to or watch people in order to 
intimidate them or to satisfy the interests of certain parties or 
political formations 
more than 3575 security personnel have been suspended and 
others are being investigated the defense ministry said about 
15000 officers worked fulltime for securitate and tens of 
thousands of informers also were on the payroll

the us economy grew at its slowest pace in 
more than three years in 1989 the government said wednesday 
analysts welcomed a slight upward revision in fourthquarter 
activity but many remain anxious over prospects this year 
the commerce department revised the fourth quarter gross 
national product upwards from 05 percent to 09 percent which in 
turn boosted overall 1989 economic growth to 30 percent from last 
months 29 percent 
despite the improvement it was the slowest yearly growth since 
a 27 percent gain in 1986 and the lowest quarterly advance since 
the economy grew 08 percent in the third quarter of that year the 
gnp rose 44 in 1988 
the bottom line is the economy is likely to stay out of a 
recession but just barely said david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co a new york government securities dealer 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said the report offered 
further evidence that the downward slide of the economy had come to 
an end although the threat of a recession still existed 
whenever you have economic growth as low as this you are 
vulnerable he told members of the house budget committee but he 
said that the greatest danger point for a recession had passed in 
the fall and early winter and that chances for a downturn were now 
lower 
greenspan said the federal reserves economic forecast that the 
gnp would grow at a modest annual rate of 175 percent to 2 percent 
this year was an expectation of a modest quickening pace 
somewhat later in the year but a very modest quickening 
the bush administration is forecasting 26 percent growth this 
year the revised 30 percent rise in the gnp exceeded its 29 
percent projection for 1989 
comparing the economy at present to a tire with a slow leak 
greenspan said as best we can judge the leak has stopped the 
system is no longer eroding it has stabilized it has not yet 
however started to exhibit any significant reversal 
samuel d kahan chief financial economist for fuji securities 
inc in chicago also said the danger of recession is minimal but 
he contended the outlook over the next two quarters is more of 
the same that is more positive growth but really sluggish 
growth of 1 percent or thereabouts 
the gnp represents the total us output of goods and services 
and is the broadest measure of the nations economic health 
an inflation index tied to the gnp was revised downward from a 
38 percent annual rate to 36 percent but that was not enough to 
change the 45 percent rate for the year it was the fastest 
increase since a 62 percent jump in 1982 
the commerce department said an improvement in the trade deficit 
was the major contributor to the fourthquarter gnp revision 
decembers imbalance the lowest monthy deficit in five years was 
not available when the department made its initial gnp estimate in 
january 
as a result of the new information exports were revised upwards 
from 49 percent to 86 percent while imports were lowered from 
75 percent to 2 percent 
that and an increase in personal consumption spending were 
enough to offset downward revisions in business inventories and 
business investment spending 
while the decline in inventories was a negative factor for the 
gnp it was good news for the economy as a whole if inventories 
were to pile up excessively it could mean cutbacks in production 
and a loss of jobs 
the fact that business was able to keep inventories lean and 
mean has essentially reduced the downside risk in the economy 
jones said

three days of informal cambodian peace 
talks ended thursday with delegates still deadlocked on how to run 
the country until a new government can be elected the cohost of 
the negotiations said 
no major breakthroughs had been expected talks at a higher 
level are planned this month in paris 
the jakarta meeting focused on an australian proposal to have 
the united nations run cambodia until elections and to deploy an 
international peacekeeping force to ensure security 
the five permanent un security council members britain 
china france the soviet union and the united states support 
the australian plan it was proposed after formal peace talks in 
paris broke down last summer largely over the question of how the 
cambodian factions would share power before elections 
the vietnamesebacked government of cambodia and the 
threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting it appear to agree on 
un supervision of elections but they differ on who should be in 
charge of cambodia until the vote 
premier hun sen contends that dismantling the present 
administration could enable the communist khmer rouge guerrillas to 
seize power 
khmer rouge spokesmen have expressed reservations over the 
australian plan but have not announced a full policy decision 
prince norodom sihanouk and son sann leaders of the two 
noncommunist guerrilla groups have welcomed the australian 
proposal 
prime minister ali atlatas of indonesia said the talks ended 
early thursday with delegates unable to reach agreement he said no 
document was issued 
in addition to the four cambodian factions the talks included 
delegates from france laos the united nations and the association 
of southeast asian nations brunei indonesia malaysia the 
philippines singapore and thailand 
millions have been killed in cambodia since 1970 when a coup 
ended three decades of rule by sihanouk the khmer rouge took power 
in 1975 after a civil war and then killed hundreds of thousands of 
people in trying to create a new agrarian society 
vietnam invaded in late 1978 to oust the khmer rouge but never 
was able to completely stamp out the guerrilla resistance which 
holds cambodias seat in the un general assembly vietnam said it 
withdrew the last of its troops from cambodia last fall but there 
have been allegations that some soldiers and advisers have returned 
to help support government troops 
under the australian plan the un seat would be declared 
vacant until a new government was formed after elections 
australias foreign minister gareth evans also proposed a 
supreme national council with delegates from each of the four 
factions to hold the countrys sovereignty during the transition

the exxon valdez had an exceptionally 
small crew on the voyage which ended in disaster a possible cause 
of stress and problems a veteran tanker captain testified today 
robert beevers undergoing crossexamination by the defense 
said the ships he sailed on often had a crew of 32 people but by 
the time he quit in 1987 companies were scaling it down because of 
economics 
the exxon valdez he said had 19 crew members that was 
certainly the smallest crew on a tanker that ive seen 
asked how the crew configuration affected the ships journey 
beevers said that with a short crew theres more stress theres 
more problems 
the prosecution witness was questioned in depth about testimony 
he gave tuesday against joseph hazelwood his answers under 
questioning by hazelwood lawyer dick madson were more conciliatory 
than they had been under prosecution inquiry 
but he continued to maintain that hazelwood erred when he left 
the ships bridge during a tricky maneuver on tuesday he had 
called hazelwood reckless and guilty of bad judgment and said his 
actions risked his ship and his crew 
the master should be on the bridge he said 
traditionally that is his duty 
jurors in the hazelwood trial were warned to avoid news reports 
while defense lawyers worried that word of a federal indictment of 
exxon corp might prejudice the skippers trial 
hazelwood lawyer michael chalos criticized the timing of 
tuesdays indictment of exxon and its subsidiary exxon shipping 
co on two felony charges and three misdemeanors stemming from the 
nations largest oil spill 
im wondering if there isnt a bigger political force at work 
here theyve waited 11 months why as were finishing the trial 
are they putting out press releases and an indictment chalos 
said theres a lot more here than meets the eye 
superior court judge karl johnstone warned jurors that if they 
could not avoid news reports he had the power to sequester them in 
a hotel although he added that step wasnt necessary yet 
any information concerning the oil spill is off limits 
johnstone said 
the defense indicated no plans to seek a mistrial chalos said 
a mistrial at this point would only help the state because we 
feel its going very well for captain hazelwood 
until now hazelwood 43 had been the only defendant charged 
criminally in the tanker grounding he is charged with a felony 
criminal mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of 
oil if convicted he could get 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
the 987foot exxon valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of 
alaska crude oil into the clear waters of prince william sound on 
march 24 killing countless birds fish and other wildlife and 
tarring beaches for hundreds of miles 
the exxon indictment accuses the company of employing crew 
members knowing such persons to be physically and mentally 
incapable of performing the duties assigned to them 
it mentions that the skipper left the ships bridge in the hands 
of an uncertified third mate and a helmsman who was known by 
exxon shipping company to be incompetent at performing his assigned 
duties 
the latter was a reference to robert kagan the helmsman who has 
been blamed by witnesses for failing to steer the ship properly he 
remains an employee of exxon hazelwood was fired shortly after the 
accident 
of hazelwood witness beevers said he created the risk of 
grounding of losing the vessel of fire explosion and death to 
his crew and of pollution that occurred 
he accused hazelwood of trying to drive his stranded ship off a 
jagged reef in prince william sound without taking necessary tests 
to determine its stability he said hazelwood risked sinking or 
capsizing the ship 
i feel that he used very poor judgment in his actions 
basically from the time they grounded to well after the engines 
were stopped beevers said 
beevers said he is being paid 35000 for his services in 
helping prosecutors prepare their case against hazelwood he worked 
14 years as a tanker captain and retired from the merchant marine 
in 1987 
hazelwood lawyer dick madson asked mr beevers youre not 
perfect are you 
no im not said beevers who acknowledged he sometimes had 
used bad judgment 
and have you ever had someone hired to say you exercised bad 
judgment asked madson 
no said the witness 
assistant district attorney brent cole said he would rest his 
case by weeks end

underwater explorer robert ballard will guide 
more than 250000 children through a hightech tour of two 
shipwrecks from the war of 1812 in a science project sponsored by 
the jason foundation for education 
about 40 children will accompany ballard to lake ontario to 
examine the remains of the hamilton and scourge which ballard 
called incredible archeological treasures more than a 
quartermillion more students will view the expedition on screens 
via satellite links in schools and museums across the united states 
and canada 
the jason foundation named for a robotic device used in the 
explorations last year went to the mediterranean sea to look at an 
underground volcano and the deepest known ancient shipwreck site 
cameras will take the children on closeup tours of the lake and 
sunken ships they will be able to ask questions of ballard during 
the presentations and may also be permitted to operate the robot 
through the satellite link ballard said 
ballard senior scientist for the woods hole oceanographic 
institution in massachusetts discovered the titanic in 1985 and 
the german battleship bismarck last year he founded the jason 
foundation for education a joint venture of educators scientists 
museums and private industry to encourage scientific careers among 
american children 
ballard said there are no american graduate students at woods 
hole which is affiliated with mit and 60 percent of applicants 
for the coming year are foreign we are hopelessly behind france 
germany england and japan ballard said he said the problem 
begins in grades 412 and results in widespread scientific 
illiteracy 
the jason project will train more than 4000 teachers in a 
curriculum developed specifically for the lake ontario expedition 
their pupils will be wellgrounded in engineering robotics marine 
biology archeology maritime history and other relevant areas by 
the time ballard and his crew begin broadcasting live from the lake 
bottom on april 30

theres no lake and los angeles 
is 100 miles away so residents are voting to determine whats in a 
name 
the chamber of commerce is sending out ballots to homes and 
businesses in lake los angeles giving the 15000 residents a 
chance to rename their town said chamber president mary jarvis 
richard blalock the owner of mr bs restaurant already has 
his mind made up the name to me is meaningless 
one commonly mentioned alternative name is twin cities which 
refers to the towns split identity between lancaster 25 miles to 
the north and palmdale 12 miles south ms jarvis said 
postal delivery zones triggered the possible namedropping in 
this unincorporated community northeast of los angeles 
residents serviced by the lancaster post office must drive a 
halfhour to pick up parcels and the rest take the southern road 
to the palmdale post office 
but to get their own zip code residents must vote to 
incorporate their community hence the search for the right name 
the antelope valley community originally featured a manmade 
lake that was too costly to maintain now a baseball diamond sits 
on the dry lake bed 
people say we have no lake we are not part of los angeles 
so we should not be called lake los angeles ms jarvis said 
but its been pointed out that there are not any antelope in 
the antelope valley either so whats in a name

got a buck and a dream of smalltown living 
this rural community has a deal for you 
to attract residents minto is offering three dozen building 
lots for 1 apiece 
the idea is to try and entice some people into minto somebody 
who is thinking about building in the area said councilman tony 
osowski who conceived the homesteading plan 
most of the lots are in a 38acre subdivision that remained 
unfinished when a developer went bankrupt walsh county seized the 
unsold property to make up for nonpayment of taxes and sold it to 
the town for 1 a lot two years ago said auditor leo misialek 
buyers will be entitled to a twoyear real estate tax exemption 
on new singlefamily homes up to 75000 in value and they wont 
have to pay special assessments for a recently built water and 
sewer system 
but they must pay legal fees to buy the lots and a fee to 
connect with the towns water supply the street needs 
blacktopping and new residents likely would have to pay for that

former president reagans diaries accurately 
document important events in the irancontra affair that reagan now 
says he has forgotten john poindexter said in court papers 
wednesday 
lawyers for the former national security adviser said us 
district court judge harold greene should order reagan to turn over 
36 diary excerpts for the former advisers irancontra trial which 
is scheduled to start monday 
greene directed reagan on jan 30 to supply poindexter with the 
excerpts but the former president invoked executive privilege to 
avoid turning them over the bush administration later joined 
reagan in invoking executive privilege and greene now plans to rule 
on the matter 
in testimony videotaped feb 1617 for poindexters trial 
reagan repeatedly professed an inability to recall certain key 
events poindexters lawyers said but poindexter believes these 
events are accurately documented in his diaries 
poindexters court filing characterized as patently 
frivolous the justice departments assertion that almost all 
information in the diary entries is already in the public domain 
the justice departments position overlooks that mr reagan is 
the one who caused this information to enter the public domain and 
it is he who determined that the public interest demanded such 
disclosures said poindexter 
reagan is now trying to claim that the public interest all of 
a sudden favors nondisclosure when a criminal defendants right 
to liberty is at stake said poindexters lawyers 
the defense filing said the excerpts touch on reagans knowledge 
of poindexters activities on behalf of the contra rebels in 
nicaragua and on reagans knowledge of israeli arms shipments to 
iran in late 1985 it said the excerpts also address reagans 
knowledge that proceeds were generated from us arms sales to iran 
greene who has seen the diary excerpts said one entry reports 
on poindexters successful trip to central america in december 
1985 and contains a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably indicating 
reagan knew of poindexters activities on behalf of the contras 
in his videotaped deposition reagan testified he was unable to 
recall what poindexter reported to him about the central american 
trip 
another diary entry according to greene deals with reagans 
meetings with officials including poindexter in december 1985 on 
the sales of arms to iran 
the former president testified that he doesnt recall a november 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles from israel to iran 
a third diary excerpt briefly addresses the issue of the 
proceeds from arms sales to iran the judge said 
reagan testified that he was unaware of the diversion of iran 
arms sale proceeds to the contras and that he was aware only that 
the us government had received 122 million covering the cost of 
weapons sold to iran 
he said that had he known about additional money he would 
have given it back

the united states has rushed arms to the unita 
rebels under siege by sovietbacked government forces in angola 
angolan representatives said wednesday after meeting with us 
defense officials 
it was believed to be the first meeting at the pentagon with 
officials from angola which does not have diplomatic relations 
with the united states gen roberto leal monteiro an adviser to 
president jose eduardo dos santos and justice minister fernando 
franca van dunem met with defense department officials the 
angolans said 
a pentagon official confirmed that a meeting had taken place 
with deputy assistant secretary of defense jim woods the official 
who asked not to be named described the session as establishing a 
basis for future talks 
it was a get acquainted meeting very friendly and 
nonthreatening she said 
the angolans said the talks centered on the escalating fighting 
in angola the most bitter in the countrys 15year civil war 
the angolans said they urged the united states to stop arming 
unita so that peace talks stalled since the summer could resume 
angolan forces attacked unita to punish the rebels for acts of 
sabotage and to prove that the angolan military could subdue unita 
without cubas help said van dunem under a usmediated 
agreement more than 30000 cuban troops have left angola and an 
additional 20000 are to leave by mid1991 
the angolan government submitted a peace proposal including an 
immediate ceasefire on feb 6 but has yet to receive an answer 
from mobutu sese seko the president of zaire and a mediator in 
talks between the angolan government and unita van dunem said 
us officials say they have not been able to find out whether 
mobutu received the proposal in any case angola is unwilling to 
have direct talks with unita leader jonas savimbi while the united 
states believes that should be the next move said one us 
official who asked not to be named 
we are more interested in a peaceful than a military 
solution said van dunem 
gen monteiro said two ships loaded with weapons for unita had 
arrived since feb 2 at the port of matadi in northern zaire the 
arms were then flown to a usbuilt airfield in unita territory in 
southeastern zaire he said 
the angolan army also has intelligence information that five to 
eight us military advisers are helping unita at the guerrilas 
headquarters in the town of jamba 
the pentagon official who requested anonymity declined to 
comment on the specific claims made by the angolans regarding us 
aid to unita 
van dunem said angolas air force bombed a military command post 
in jamba last saturday but he denied unitas claims that chemical 
weapons had been used 
official figures on the extent of us aid for unita are secret 
estimates range from 40 million to 80 million and are said to 
include stinger antiaircraft missiles the soviets are believed to 
have provided 600 million to 800 million in aid over the course 
of the war 
gen monteiro said government forces captured usmade tow 
antitank missiles in the town of mavinga which he said fell in 
bloody fighting earlier this month government troops also found 
usmade claymore antipersonnel mines and 81mm mortars van dunem 
said 
unita blew up the airstrip at mavinga to prevent it from falling 
into enemy hands he said fighting around mavinga continues in 
what he described as cleanup operations 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said fighting continues around mavinga but its not clear if 
either controls the entire town the official could not confirm 
that jamba had been bombed 
unita has denied jamba was bombed but said the government 
conducted intensive bombings on other parts of unita territory 
asked whether government forces would advance on jamba van 
dunem said we have no intention to have a military victory 
over unita but if the guerrillas continue to wage sabotage the 
army will retaliate he said 
the united states doesnt have formal diplomatic relations with 
angola but has had informal discussions with the government for 
several years in efforts to resolve southern african issues 
the current talks are an extention of that effort and are aimed 
at supporting mobutus attempt to negotiate a peace settlement

us agents do not need warrants for searches 
in other countries the supreme court ruled wednesday in a decision 
seen as bolstering the fight against drug smugglers and terrorists 
and perhaps aiding the prosecution of ousted panamanian leader 
manuel noriega 
by a 63 vote the justices upheld the warrantless search of the 
home of a supected mexican drug smuggler 
foreigners living abroad do not have the same rights as us 
citizens or aliens living here the court said 
in another decision the court gave police broad new authority 
to conduct sweeping searches in this country after making arrests 
in private homes 
voting 72 the justices said police may use the evidence seized 
when they arrested a riverdale md man accused of armed robbery 
the ruling reinstated his conviction and 35year prison sentence 
the court said police may search throughout a house when they 
have a reasonable suspicion there is a hidden danger to the 
arresting officers even if authorities lack a search warrant or 
probable cause to believe there is a danger 
in a third ruling the court said states may make the death 
penalty the only punishment for some murderers without violating 
the constitutions ban on mandatory death sentences the court by 
a 54 vote upheld a pennsylvania law 
in the drugsmuggling case the court narrowed the fourth 
amendments protection against unreasonable searches and seizures 
aliens are entitled to such constitutional safeguards only 
when they have come within the territory of the united states and 
developed substantial connections with this country chief 
justice william h rehnquist said 
without mentioning the noriega case rehnquist said 
situations threatening to important american interests may arise 
halfway around the globe that require an american response 
with armed force 
he added if there are to be restrictions on searches and 
seizures which occur incident to such american action they must be 
imposed by the political branches through diplomatic understanding 
treaty or legislation 
the ruling could help the governments prosecution of noriega on 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges from a 12count 
indictment handed down in february 1988 
after us troops invaded panama in december to capture noriega 
he surrendered and was brought to the united states to stand trial 
in florida 
there has been speculation noriegas lawyers might argue us 
armed forces illegally seized evidence in the invasion 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the high courts ruling 
recognizes the right and need of law enforcement officers to have 
lawful practical means of dealing with international drug 
trafficking operations 
drug traffickers and terrorists will take no cheer from the 
courts opinion thornburgh said 
the us military is seeking to become more involved in fighting 
drug smuggling by using spy satellites and other surveillance 
techniques to track suspects in foreign countries 
wednesdays decision was denounced by the courts dissenters 
justice william j brennan said the decision lets authorities 
indiscriminately break down doors when the door being broken 
belongs to a foreigner 
if we expect aliens to obey our laws aliens should be able to 
expect that we will obey our constitution when we investigate 
prosecute and punish them lawlessness breeds lawlessness 
brennan said 
justices thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun also dissented 
justices byron r white john paul stevens sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy joined rehnquist in ruling 
against suspected drug smuggler rene verdugo urquidez he was 
convicted in california in 1988 of taking part in the 1985 
kidnapping torture and murder of drug enforcement administration 
agent enrique camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
verdugo is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life and will 
not be eligible for parole until he is 96 
his drug conviction and sentence in the murders were not at 
issue in the high court case the search warrant issue arose in a 
separate although related prosecution 
after he was arrested and turned over to us agents his home 
in mexicali mexico was searched by dea agents in 1988 with 
cooperation from mexican authorities 
the dea seized a tally sheet that the agency said shows the 
quantities of marijuana smuggled into the united states by verdugo 
a us appeals court ruled the search was unlawful because the 
dea agents lacked a warrant from an american judge 
government lawyers said requiring warrants in such cases could 
hamper the campaign against drug smugglers the dea has offices in 
45 nations and in 1988 alone it said it helped in investigations 
that led to 1200 arrests of suspected drug smugglers in foreign 
countries

west african leaders whose nations 
have been hit by recent demonstrations for democracy have responded 
in different ways from tear gas to tears 
the regions beleaguered leaders have confronted waves of 
protests strikes and public dissatisfaction in the ivory coast 
benin gabon gambia and niger 
in benin mathieu kerekou the authoritarian marxist 
brigadiergeneral who seized control of the country in 1972 sobbed 
openly before a national conference tuesday when delegates demanded 
he resign 
he accused them of attempting a civilian coup and said he 
preferred to be ousted resignation would betray the peoples 
trust he said 
kerekou was forced to call the conference after violent protests 
in which several people were killed at the end of last year 
rioters stoned a statue of lenin and burned pictures of kerekou 
who in december renounced the marxistleninist policies that have 
bankrupted benin 
in the nearby ivory coast a pillar of stability and civilian 
government in a region plagued by powerhungry military men 
conservative president felix houphouetboigny had to order soldiers 
and riot police to suppress protests last week by rebellious 
students calling for multiparty democracy 
tear gas stun grenades and truncheons were let loose in abidjan 
on demonstrators usually armed only with signs 
but houphouetboigny who has governed since the countrys 1960 
independence from france responded positively to more moderate 
demands for cuts in cabinet ministers salaries and the cost of 
board and lodging at the state university 
the ivorian leader has rejected previous demands for a 
multiparty state arguing that the system endangers national unity 
on a continent wracked by tribal rivalries 
france apparently intent on safeguarding its interests in 
former colonies apparently agrees paris recently advised guinea 
to model political reforms on the ivory coast not a multiparty 
democracy 
there are some multiparty states that have no democracy and 
some oneparty states that practice democracy like ivory 
coast former french prime minister jacques chirac commented in 
abidjan this week 
omar bongo of gabon another beleaguered west african leader 
identified the immediate cause of strikes and protests in the 
region he blamed falling purchasing power provoked by the 
austerity programs of the international monetary fund in an 
interview with radio france international this week 
bongos 22yearold civilian rule is threatened by strikes and 
protests that have closed librevilles airport electricity cuts 
that caused the deaths of five patients in the capitals hospital 
wednesday and rampaging students who forced schools to close 
this weeks strikes are over dissatisfaction with political 
reforms announced friday including the replacement of the 
discredited democratic party with a social democratic rally which 
bongo said is open to all political ideas 
the change falls short of promises bongo made after an octoe 
coup attempt to consider transforming gabon into a multiparty 
democracy 
the upheaval in gabon follows 10 years of recession caused by 
slumping prices of the commodities that underpin african economies 
it has brought unemployment salary cuts and inflation 
austerity measures forced by the international monetary fund and 
world bank in return for loans have caused hardships that 
protesters say have become unbearable 
ivorian authorities this week proposed cuts of between 15 
percent and 40 percent in the salaries of government employees who 
have suffered an eightyear wage freeze in addition to a new 10 
percent income tax 
for a messenger earning the minimum wage of 125 that means 
earning 25 percent less in a country where a bag of rice to feed a 
family for a month costs 30 and rent for two rooms more than 40 
ivory coast is one of the luckier countries the minimum monthly 
salary in ghana nigeria or sierra leone is not enough to buy a bag 
of rice 
the international monetary fund and world bank are easy targets 
for attack gambian reporter baboucar m gaye coined a new term 
our country has been imfd he declared in a report 
he said economic problems are compounded by the convertible 
central african franc of 11 west african states that is 
underwritten by the french treasury and is set at an inflated rate 
that encourages huge import and customs duties and discourages 
foreign investors 
bata shoe company which operates in the most ecnomically 
difficult african nations including marxist ethiopia closed its 
factory in ivory coast because smugglers could import shoes more 
cheaply than the company could import its raw materials 
the world bank official also pointed to the corruption and 
lavish official lifestyles that have drained state coffers and 
angered impoverished west africans into revolt 
gambians criticized extravagant celebrations in february marking 
25 years of independence from britain that were attended by 
britains princess anne and george bush jr the us presidents 
son 
most gambians are muttering privately that the state of 
austerity should have compelled us to forgo any celebrations 
gaye said 
some leaders blame unidentified outside sources for their 
troubles 
nigers gen ali saibou wednesday accused a small group of 
malcontents plotting to destabilize and throw niger into 
chaos of engineering violent student protests in which troops 
have killed at least three demonstrators 
saibou promised democracy when he led a 1987 coup but recently 
declared the military would not surrender power and announced plans 
for a constitution allowing only one political party

jewelry store manager bob husman says he 
had no idea he was in the path of a killer tornado right until 
the time the roof fell on my head he wonders if better radar 
would have saved an employee 
in fact this north alabama city was so shaken by the 20 deaths 
caused by the nov 15 storm that officials want to pay 120000 to 
upgrade the radar at the local office of the national weather 
service 
the weather service says no thanks 
federal officials plan to close the huntsville office and more 
than 100 others while installing the 450 million next generation 
weather radar dubbed nexrad 
huntsville officials worry they wont be close enough to nexrad 
units to benefit from the advanced technology but the system is 
eagerly awaited in other parts of the southeast that have been 
blindsided by killer storms 
people are not being warned in time said gil patrick a 
meteorologist for walbtv in albany ga in nearby colquitt county 
two people were killed oct 1 by a tornado unseen by the nearest 
weather service radar in columbus ga 
patrick thinks planned nexrad units in atlanta jacksonville 
fla and tuskegee will help southwest georgia 
north carolinas congressional delegation is pushing for the 
earliest possible installation of nexrad in raleigh an unexpected 
tornado killed four people in the eastern part of the state nov 
28 1988 while the weather radar unit in raleigh was awaiting 
repair 
the new system scheduled to be complete by 1996 can follow the 
movement of moisture in the air the current system can only 
measure how much moisture is present meteorologists say the 
improvement will allow them to identify tornadoes before they 
descend earthward 
it holds the promise of increasing the lead time for tornado 
warnings from the current average of three minutes to as much as 30 
minutes said curtis stanford a staff member of the house 
subcommittee that oversees the weather service 
the extra time would have been precious to husman in addition 
to the employee who died husman and four others were hurt when the 
golbro jewelry store was demolished by the huntsville tornado 
thirty minutes would have made a great deal of difference in 
what we could have done he said we couldnt have done much to 
save our business but we could have done something to prevent 
death and injury 
the day of the storm husman heard news reports about the 
possibility of severe weather but the warnings were no more 
serious than we get with normal thunderstorms 
certainly there was no thought of immediate danger right 
until the time the roof fell on my head 
the weather service issued a tornado warning as the storm hit 
the tornado killed 20 injured 463 and drove 500 people from their 
homes it also called sharp attention to the weather services 
proposal to put the closest nexrad units in birmingham and in 
nashville tenn each about 100 miles from huntsville 
blair conrad of the huntsvillemadison county airport authority 
said the weakpoint of the weather service plan is that nexrads 
capability to measure speed and direction of moisture in the air 
diminishes beyond about 70 miles 
don sarreals assistant to the director of the nexrad program 
office acknowledges the curvature of the earth prevents the radar 
beams from picking up loweraltitude funnels more than 92 miles 
away but the weather service contends nexrad can spot telltale 
cyclone patterns that occur at altitudes of 10000 feet to 15000 
feet within 125 nautical miles 
gary petti of the weather services birmingham office said a 
nexrad unit in huntsville might have missed the november tornado 
because of its close range 
the weather service has 249 offices including 52 fully staffed 
forecasting offices said sarreals the agency plans to shut down 
small offices and reorganize into 113 fully staffed offices plus 
13 river forecast centers 
the services 113 nexrad units will work in conjunction with 24 
to be run by the pentagon 
while congress has been enthusiastic about nexrad many members 
are concerned that some of the planned office closings are 
motivated as much by the need for budget cuts as the advent of the 
new radar stanford said 
a provision in the federal budget this year prohibits the 
closing of any weather station unless the weather service first 
puts into place the nexrad unit and runs tests to show the affected 
area will not suffer a loss in service

louis cathedral were still wearing mardi gras beads but they were 
a lot quieter than they were tuesday 
nowhere was the contrast between fat tuesday and ash wednesday 
more evident than at pat obriens famous patio bar in the quarter 
employee michele dolaway said the bar packed with rowdy 
revelers on tuesday opened at 10 am wednesday to welcome a 
smaller gentler crowd 
a lot of people want to just sit on the patio or in the piano 
bar and have one last hurricane she said and then there are 
some who just need a little of the hair of the dog 
layers of debris that covered the st charles avenue parade 
route included paper cracked drink coolers fastfood containers 
and discarded or lost clothing 
if you can gauge a good time by how much people left behind 
everyone left this one very very happy said james w lee jr 
director of sanitation 
workers will have collected more than 2000 tons of trash by 
friday up from 1895 tons last year lee said 
arrest figures were not available wednesday but deputy police 
chief arnesta taylor said he thought arrests went down perhaps by 
25 percent this year despite the crowd 
tourists took their time leaving the city wednesday morning 
crowds at the new orleans international airport were light but 
afternoon and thursday flights were heavily booked said larry 
johnson chief of airfield operations 
i guess most people booked late flights so theyd have the 
morning to sober up he said

a terminally ill student who needs a bone marrow 
donor gets support from dustin hoffman no its not a hollywood 
tearjerker its a reallife drama 
the oscarwinning actor has made a sixfigure donation and has 
taken a lead role in a plea for allison atlas who was told in 
august she had three to six months to live unless a marrow 
transplant checked her leukemia 
if we find a donor wed literally be taking someone off death 
row hoffman said theres a clock ticking which shes aware 
of its a hideous clock 
miss atlas is one of more than 9000 people awaiting a donor 
about 25 people die each day from blood diseases that could be 
cured through marrow transplants according to the lifesavers 
foundation of america a nonprofit group that recruits donors and 
raises money for blood tests 
a teenager who was the object of a nationwide donor search died 
last week in silver spring md joanne johnson 19 had the support 
of the rev jesse jackson and singer dionne warwick but no donor 
was found in time 
about 15 families have appealed for donors yet something about 
miss atlas a 20yearold business major at new york university and 
a resident of bethesda md got hoffman involved 
its hard to explain it picked me said hoffman winner of 
academy awards for best actor for last years rain man and for 
the 1979 kramer vs kramer 
ive always done things privately and would have preferred to 
have kept it that way but in this case there was no other way i 
could help hoffman said tuesday 
he refused to say how much money he gave but his publicist 
confirmed it was more than 100000 
hoffman has asked his show business friends to help and he said 
hell pick up the tab for a vacation for the donor who matches miss 
atlas 
i got a twoweek vacation for anywhere they want to go in the 
world im treating he said 
miss atlas has a type of leukemia that rarely strikes anyone 
under age 65 the disease defeats the bodys ability to make blood 
cells but transplanted bone marrow can correct that 
no matches for her marrow type were found among family members 
or the 70000 names registered by the minnesotabased national bone 
marrow donor registry which was created by congress in 1986 
so the atlas family went public in november since then more 
than 16000 people offered to be donors and 13 million was 
pledged to pay for tests according to the family each test costs 
75 
because of the familys efforts 25 to 50 potential donors were 
found for other people in her condition according to registry 
officials 
the atlas family drive is going to result in many lives being 
saved said liz quam spokeswoman for the registry 
marrow a bloodcolored substance with the consistency of jelly 
makes blood cells and the bodys diseasefighting tools 
in adult transplants a quart of marrow is drawn from the hip 
bone and injected into the diseased person after intense radiation 
and chemotherapy kills all cancer cells about 300 transplants have 
been done during the past two years 
the donor requires an overnight hospital stay the body replaces 
donated marrow within three weeks 
the odds of finding a donor are about one in 20000 the 
registry hopes to have a pool of 250000 names which would cost 
about 15 million 
meanwhile miss atlas gets a blood transfusion every three to 
four weeks and waits she is the youngest of three children of 
alvin atlas owner of a clothing store 
time is of the essence for every leukemia victim weve come 
very close its just a matter of getting the right person to come 
to one of our drives said the softspoken browneyed miss atlas 
she is thrilled and grateful for hoffmans support 
hes just been so beneficial to us i dont know if its fate 
or what miss atlas said its my only hope

many american politicians who for years 
condemned nicaraguan president daniel ortega as an untrustworthy 
marxist aggressor are reacting with surprise over his quiet 
acceptance of electoral defeat 
others say that a careful examination of the record will show 
that ortega in an utterly consistent fashion always kept his word 
once he gave it 
but still others point out that nicaragua is now entering a 
period of political transition with ortegas sandinistas in firm 
control of a large standing army and with ortega himself 
proclaiming that the nations revolution has not been extinguished 
the story sure isnt over said former sen daniel evans 
rwash who briefed the senate republican caucus this week on his 
experiences as an official observer of the nicaraguan election 
process 
refering to ortegas concession of defeat by violeta chamorro 
sen howell heflin dala said i was really caught off guard 
i was basically surprised 
i thought we were going to have another noriega situation 
heflin said referring to nowdeposed panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriegas nullification of his countrys presidential 
elections last year 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas who for years 
denounced ortega and the sandinistas for allegedly exporting 
revolution throughout central america wasnt ready to to 
philosophize about why ortega permitted a fair election and why he 
didnt quibble about the results 
hes defeated i havent tried to analyze him dole said 
i just enjoyed the results 
sen ted stevens ralaska said he believes ortega and the 
sandinistas simply bowed to reality the severe impact of reagans 
economic sanctions made defeat inevitable he said adding im 
going to call president reagan and tell him that 
but sen richard lugar rind who was denied permission by the 
sandinista government to lead a team of congressional election 
observers to nicaragua said he believes ortega has undergone an 
evolution of style 
it is surprising lugar said of ortegas concession without 
a struggle 
but i suppose equally surprising was his conduct in the last 
few weeks as he adopted western campaign techniques dispensing 
with much of his security apparatus and campaigning voter to 
voter rally to rally lugar said 
now lugar said ortega has transformed himself into an 
important opposition figure 
evans said he believes the sandinistas have not chosen to change 
the election results by military force because there was a 
recognition that if they were to use the power of his army ortega 
would initiate a bloody bloody conflict in every city and on every 
street 
i think there was also a feeling that well we didnt win 
this one but there will be another time another day and at some 
point we could well be back in power he said noting that the 
next presidential election is scheduled in six years 
looking at the troubles that lie ahead for nicaragua evans 
noted that mrs chamorros uno coalition spans the political 
spectrum from the far right to the nicaraguan communist party and 
is therefore fragile 
moreover compared to the sandinistas who have a decade of 
government experience behind them the uno coalition is terribly 
weak in terms of expertise evans said 
he noted that the sandinistas will still be in control of many 
municipalities and will retain strong representation in the 
national assembly and on every important elected body 
the sandinistas still have the army a party army evans 
said unos task is to change that take command and reduce the 
size of the armed forces 
mrs chamorro and her coalition will inherit an economy in ruins 
and despite the fact that much of the blame can be attributed to 
sandinista mismanagement ortega will be looking to exploit his 
successors mistakes evans said 
as events unfold in nicaragua i fear that the tendency in the 
united states will be to give a deep sigh of relief and move on and 
pay little further attention evans said and that would be a 
tragedy

a courtbacked agreement on safety measures 
for allterrain vehicles has failed to result in the expected sharp 
decline in injuries and deaths the chairman of a house panel said 
wednesday 
rep doug barnard dga whose subcommittee helped prompt a 
1988 agreement banning new sales of threewheeled offtheroad 
vehicles questioned the agressiveness of the federal consumer 
product safety commission in enforcing safety provisions for atvs 
your advocacy to me comes short barnard told commission 
chairman jacqueline jonessmith 
in a hearing before barnards house government operations 
subcommittee safety experts said that offroad vehicles remain 
inherently unstable and deceptively dangerous for their riders 
they said that there are some 25 million of the existing 
threewheeled models and the newer fourwheel versions many of 
them ridden primarily by children they said an agreement by 
manufacturers not to sell adultsized vehicles for use by children 
under 16 is being ignored 
atvs are kidkillers plain and simple said charles chvala 
a wisconsin state senator who is pushing state legislation to 
restrict the vehicles 
the industry defended its action and safety record 
riding an atv is far less risky than a number of other popular 
activities said howard p willens lobbyist for distributers of 
honda kawasaki suzuki and yamaha brand vehicles 
distributors of the three and fourwheeled vehicles agreed to a 
consent decree with the federal government in 1988 on safety steps 
for atvs the order signed by federal judge gerhard gesell was in 
response to a suit by the consumer product safety commission after 
congressional hearings 
as part of the agreement the industry agreed to sell only 
fourwheeled versions in the future but there was no recall of 
existing threewheel models it also required safety warnings and 
public awareness campaigns and sale of adultsize vehicles only 
for use by people 16 or over 
jonessmith defended that agreement and the commissions 
enforcement she said deaths and injuries due to the vehicles have 
declined from 350 in 1986 to approximately 300 annually about 40 
percent of the deaths are children under 16 she said 
she said an undercover investigation by the cpsc staff found a 
majority of dealers recommended vehicles not appropriate for a 
purchaser seeking a vehicle for a 13yearold child she said 
distributers should take steps to make their dealers comply with 
age requirements 
janine jagger assistant professor of neurosurgery at the 
university of virginia said the consent decree is a safety 
sham that has not lessened risk or changed the practices of 
this irresponsible and arrogant industry 
willens the industry lobbyist said the injury rate has dropped 
52 percent since 1985 and the fatality rate 27 percent 
willens said most fatalities were due to extreme forms of 
vehicle misuse 
barnard said he was concerned deaths have not declined further 
and called on the commission to face whether continuing levels of 
death and injury with atvs are reasonable 
i do not think it is reasonable to accept 300 deaths per year 
mostly children and tens of thousands of injuries he said

rival christian forces dueled with 
mortars and machine guns in east beirut wednesday and their 
religious leaders demanded an immediate ceasefire in the onemonth 
showdown 
no casualties were reported in the intermittent exchanges in 
ashrafiyeh held by the lebanese forces under samir geagea and on 
the citys southeastern edge controlled by gen michel aouns 
troops 
by police count the showdown for control of the 310squaremile 
christian enclave has killed 694 people and wounded 1934 since it 
broke out jan 30 a shaky ceasefire has been in effect since feb 
17 
after a threehour meeting spiritual leaders of christian sects 
demanded aoun and geagea respect the ceasefire withdraw their 
forces reopen all roads and end the vitriolic propaganda campaigns 
the leaders who met at the seat of maronite catholic patriarch 
nasrallah sfeir in bkirki north of beirut also asked that aoun 
and geagea begin a political dialogue after implementing the 
security arrangements 
geagea said in a statement he would comply with the clerics 
peace plan and said he hoped aoun would follow suit 
we hope that a similar decision will be taken by the other 
side and that the spiritual leaders will directly supervise the 
conduct of the plan geagea said 
there was no immediate reaction from aoun 
but the plan differed sharply from aouns earlier demand that a 
political agreement be reached with geagea before aoun withdraws 
his 19000 soldiers from the embattled districts of east beirut and 
other sectors 
geagea has demanded a normalization of the situation between 
his 6000strong militia and aouns troops prior to any political 
talks 
sfeir addressing the churchmen said peace was gods gift to 
man nevertheless peace is made by man we call on the leaders to 
make peace 
both aoun and geagea are maronites the catholic community that 
has dominated lebanon since its independence from france in 1943 
a threeman mediation committee said it would resume deadlocked 
efforts to work out a settlement to the worst fighting among 
christians in the nearly 15yearold civil war 
we are going through a very delicate and difficult era said 
shaker abu suleiman a member of the mediation committee who 
attended part of the meeting at bkirki 
aoun wants the lebanese forces to disband and become a political 
organization geagea refuses to break up his military force 
in september 1988 aoun was appointed head of an interim military 
cabinet by outgoing president amin gemayel after parliament failed 
to elect a successor 
but on nov 24 the lebanese parliament elected elias hrawi 
president backed by syria which has 40000 troops in lebanon 
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate aoun considers the syrians an 
occuption army 
hrawi fired aoun as army chief and caretaker premier but the 
general refused to step down alleging hrawis election was 
unconstitutional aoun considers himself the sole legitimate 
authority in lebanon 
in another development the daily annahar said a panamanian 
freighter the atlantic 3 unloaded its shipment of iraqi weapons 
at the lebanese forces port of jounieh a week ago bolstering the 
militias position 
the paper said iraq sent aoun the shipment more than four months 
ago but tried to recall it when the arab league announced a peace 
plan instead the captain dropped anchor off malta and said he 
would deliver to whoever paid 
the lebanese forces paid the paper said without elaborating on 
the price or contents

the welcome mat for east german 
immigrants is wearing thin as overcrowded resettlement centers and 
fears of higher taxes remind west germans of the cost of 
hospitality 
throughout the country west german politicians are toning down 
the euphoria over east germanys open borders and encouraging 
resettlers to return home to help rebuild their country 
at least one major conservative politician gov lothar spaeth 
of badenwuerttemburg state has even suggested east germans be 
paid to go home a strategy used to encourage turkish guest workers 
to leave several years ago 
we helped the turks return so why shouldnt we do the same 
for these people asked spaeth of chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic union 
when the mostly young skilled east germans began their exodus 
last fall west germans credited them with forcing democratic 
change in their homeland but the more than 100000 who have 
arrived already this year are increasingly seen as taking advantage 
of west germanys liberal policies 
under west germanys constitution they are granted automatic 
citizenship and are eligible for the same social benefits as west 
german taxpayers impatience with them appears to be on the rise 
the hamburgbased weekly magazine stern said in this weeks 
edition that more than twothirds of 1012 west germans questioned 
in a recent poll wanted to halt east german resettlement 
in recent weeks police had to be called to quell fights between 
drunken east germans at resettlement centers in saarland and north 
rhinewestphalia state stern said 
north rhinewestphalia already has stopped 64 towns from 
accepting more resettlers because of overcrowding the magazine 
said 
welt am sonntag newspaper reported sunday that in the northern 
port city of bremen the local government is refusing to accept 
more east german resettlers but is continuing to allow asylum 
seekers from the third world 
in one bremen resettlement center 87 east german men share one 
toilet two washing machines a small table and two chairs the 
newspaper said they sleep in doubledeck army cots in a school 
gymnasium said the report 
the gymnasium is not an isolated case the newspaper said 
about 350 east germans are living in bremen gymnasiums 
west germans complain that east german resettlers are given 
preferential treatment in social and unemployment pay and are 
overcrowding the already strapped housing market 
resettlers who quit work to come to the west are eligible for 
immediate unemployment pay which averages about 588 a month 
west germans who switch jobs must wait 12 weeks to be eligible 
for unemployment stern said 
each east german also receives a onetime payment of 117 in 
welcome money and east germans are eligible for lowinterest 
loans of 1765 to 5880 to set up households 
the leftleaning social democratic party has said kohls 
conservative government should try harder to persuade east germans 
to remain in their homeland 
with the reforms there now there is no reason they should 
leave said gov oskar lafontaine of saarland state a social 
democrat who is expected to be kohls top challenger for chancellor 
in december elections 
estimates of the costs of rebuilding east germany and putting 
the two states under a single currency have been as high as 588 
billion and there are increased fears that west germans will pay 
much of this in higher taxes 
you know whose going to pay for all this said frankfurt 
restaurant owner peter blisch we the taxpayers and it wont be 
cheap 
alexander schwerein of the christian democrats said a tax 
increase cannot be discounted if elections march 18 in east 
germany do not result in a stable government 
but kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters has said that uniting 
the two germanys can be realized without a tax increase

president bush and chief mangosuthu buthelezi 
a zulu leader conferred wednesday on how to end apartheid in south 
africa and both agreed that blackonblack violence in natal 
province must stop 
buthelezi said afterwards he urged bush to lift economic 
sanctions as soon as he legally can 
the chief a longtime foe of sanctions said isolating south 
africa just minimizes economic growth and maximizes black 
misery 
bush has expressed his own reservations about sanctions but 
aides said later his main interest in the oval office meeting was 
in discussing ways to negotiate an end to apartheid the system of 
racial discrimination that pretoria has used to enforce white 
minority rule 
buthelezi is chief minister of the tribal homeland of kwazulu 
and president of the 15million member inkatha movement which has 
opposed the african national congress guerrilla tactics and 
advocacy of sanctions 
buthelezi told reporters that black disunity is the biggest 
obstacle to negotiations with the de klerk government to end 
apartheid 
blackagainstblack fighting in natal province has claimed more 
than 2500 lives in the past three years nelson mandela the 
african national congress leader released from prison feb 11 after 
27 years appealed in durban last sunday for an end to that strife 
to negotiate an end to apartheid we as blacks must get our 
act together i really feel that the biggest obstacle to 
negotiations taking off are these cleavages in the black community 
itself said buthelezi 
buthelezi deplored the violence in natal like mandela he said 
i too demand that blacks throw their guns knives spears 
pangas and other instruments of death into the sea 
buthelezi said his gut feeling is that bush will lift 
sanctions as soon as possible but the zulu leader said he 
didnt express it in so many words 
buthelezi said he believes south african president fw de klerk 
is honest and sincere he has burned the bridges behind him we 
can only go forward the chief said 
buthelezi said last week in johannesburg that he was the target 
of a sordid smear campaign by some anc activists depicting him 
as the main cause of the natal conflict 
bush has invited mandela and de klerk for white house visits 
but no dates have been set

vice premier shimon peres said wednesday he 
believes disarray in prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc could block progress in the usbacked peace process 
peres head of the leftleaning labor party said in an 
interview with the associated press that shamirs basic problem 
right now is to keep his party together as likud hardliners put 
increasing pressure on him to reject usproposed compromises 
asked if shamir was likely to accept the compromises urged by 
us secretary of state james a baker iii to get preliminary 
israelipalestinian peace talks under way peres said i have my 
doubts 
he also repeated his warning that if shamirs party does not 
move ahead with the peace process his labor party may bolt from 
the coalition government 
if there wont be a prospect for peace there is no reason for 
us to remain in the government peres said 
shamir faces a rebellion from hardliners in his party former 
trade minister ariel sharon who quit the cabinet two weeks ago 
has threatened to convene likuds decisionmaking central committee 
next week to challenge shamirs policies sharon heads the 
committee while shamir is the chairman of the party 
sharon appeared wednesday to be trying to lower the public 
debate telling army radio i think that as the situation becomes 
worse we have to be quieter 
several other likud legislators however said they would 
support a vote of no confidence against shamir in parliament if he 
agrees to a usbacked formula that would involve palestinians 
from east jerusalem or palestinian deportees in peace talks 
likud hardliners fear such an approach could lead to a role for 
the plo which israel considers a terrorist organization or a 
threat to israels control of arab east jerusalem annexed by 
israel after its capture in the 1967 middle east war 
but shamir said he believed the opposition within likud was much 
broader that just the issues of east jerusalem and deportees 
the issue today in the likud party is they oppose the nature 
of the whole move they think its the wrong way to go peres 
said 
baker has been attempting to bridge differences between israel 
and the palestinians over how to start talks on israels plan for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the vote is 
designed to lead to limited selfrule for 17 million palestinians 
and eventual talks on the final status of the occupied lands 
peres whose party agrees to bakers suggestions has given 
shamir a march 7 deadline to approve them 
we are nearing the real decision now peres said in a 
week or so we shall see what is happening 
the likudlabor coaltion has been torn at least four times in 
the past year over how to proceed with shamirs election plan but 
peres said the current crisis was more serious than previous 
ones 
they likud have reached the point where they have to make up 
their mind he said 
peres also said that if he forms a new government he will 
continue to back the election plan rather seek a new peace formula 
if there was a new government it would stay with the current 
approach peres said 
asked how the changes sweeping east europe might affect the 
middle east peres said it will affect us greatly and deeply 
he said that as the soviet union reduces its support for leftist 
regimes arab nations will be forced to shift toward democratic 
reforms 
a few years ago nobody would think that jordan would have 
elections that russia would take resolves in their relations 
with syria peres said referring to a soviet diplomats call for 
syria to stop seeking military parity with israel 
asked about possible german unification peres said the germans 
should first tell poland that they respect current borders and 
should reassure the jews by confronting very strongly 
nationalistic or antisemitic forces

to excel again in math and science schools 
must change teaching methods and americans must change their 
attitude that such subjects are too hard and too weird 
education secretary lauro cavazos said wednesday 
rep pat williams dmont said more federal money is needed to 
update equipment for science education 
cavazos told a subcommittee of the house committee on science 
space and technology perhaps it is ambitious courageous maybe 
even a little rash to set a national education goal that american 
students will be first in the world in mathematics and science 
achievement in 10 years a goal approved by president bush and the 
nations governors sunday 
we can do it but only if we make fundamental changes in math 
and science education said cavazos who added that on every 
recent international test of math and science achievement us 
students have scored at or near the bottom 
the education department has requested 246 billion for fiscal 
1991 cavazos said bushs budget includes 230 million for the 
eisenhower mathematics and science program which supports efforts 
to improve math and science teaching and increase opportunities for 
women and minorities in these fields 
there should be better teacher preparation said cavazos 
we need to introduce science earlier and in an innovative way 
and we need to make our math curriculum more intense 
studies of mathematics curricula have shown that in contrast 
to other countries us students are exposed to a repetitious 
slowmoving curriculum that until eighth grade or even later 
consists almost completely of lowlevel arithmetic skills 
cavazos also said we must change the way we as a nation think 
about math and science for too long our national attitude has 
been that science and math are too hard and too weird for most 
people to learn and that in any case they are irrelevant and 
unimportant to the everyday life of normal people 
at a nearby hearing of the house committee on education and 
labor williams questioned the administrations commitment to 
education he said educators have told him of the struggles schools 
have trying to prepare tomorrows scientists with 20yearold 
equipment 
lets just take as a fact that equipment has to be improved 
williams said in questioning charles kolb who oversees the 
education departments budget what would you think we should use 
to buy new equipment peanuts chocolates hershey bars or would 
you suggest that maybe the transfer of money would be needed to buy 
the new equipment 
the transfer of money answered kolb 
thats the point williams said 
kolb said increased funding will not necessarily improve student 
achievement in math and science or any other subjects he noted 
that as aggregate elementary and secondary education spending in 
the united states rose by 27 percent from 1980 to 1988 scores on 
national reading and writing tests remained virtually unchanged 
m edith rasell and lawrence mishel of the economic policy 
institute said that the united states does not spend huge amounts 
on education and pointed to their study that showed the united 
states spends relatively less on elementary and secondary education 
than 13 other industrial countries

members of the postal rate commission urged on 
wednesday that they be given the final say on how much it costs to 
mail a letter 
commissioner wh trey leblanc told the house post office 
committee that it is more important now than ever before that 
the commission have final responsibility for rates 
the us postal service is expected to announce next week that 
it wants to increase rates in 1991 probably to 30 cents for a 
first class stamp 
under current procedures the independent rate commission will 
then have 10 months to review the proposed rates and to make a 
recommendation back to the postal service 
usually the commissions recommendation becomes final but the 
board of governors of the postal service can overrule it if the 
governors vote unanimously to do so that has only happened once 
someone has got to be accountable for what is happening 
commented leblanc in urging the transfer of final ratemaking power 
im definitely incined toward having the final rate power in 
the postal rate commission i would strongly support that added 
the newly installed commission chairman george w haley 
commissioner john w crutcher told reporters after the hearing 
that he agreed with leblanc 
commissioner patti birge tyson commented that she would like to 
see a system in which if the postal board of governors disagreed 
with the commission it resubmitted the proposal rather than 
voting to overrule 
the fifth commission member vice chairman henry w folsom said 
that he is not too hung up on where final authority rests 
noting that the commission nearly has that now since it takes a 
unanimous vote of the nine postal governors to overrule them 
with a new rate case expected shortly leblanc also urged 
congress to expand the powers of the commission to subpoena 
information if necessary for its deliberations 
the members of the rate commission appeared at one of a series 
of congressional hearings on postal ooperations other hearings 
will include officials of the postal service

a private health group asked the food and drug 
administration on wednesday to strengthen the wording of warning 
labels on oral contraceptives 
the public citizen health research group said its review of 13 
studies published since 1977 shows that women under 45 who use 
birth control pills for many years may be at increased risk of 
developing breast cancer 
an fda advisory committee in january 1989 recommended no 
changes in use of the pill saying research on a possible link to 
breast cancer was inconclusive and more study was needed 
more than 13 million women in the united states between the ages 
of 15 and 44 use oral contraceptives 
fourteen studies published in the past decade found no link 
between the pill and breast cancer but few of these examined women 
who began using the pill at a young age and continued for many 
years the group said 
of the 13 studies reviewed three show that the risk of early 
breast cancer appears to increase for these women said dr sidney 
wolfe director of the health research group founded by consumer 
advocate ralph nader 
wolfe said the current labeling system for oral contraceptives 
is inadequate years out of date and misleading 
the group however cautions women against stopping the pill or 
switching to a less effective method of birth control rather the 
group urges women who are concerned to discuss the research with 
their doctor

a consumer group said wednesday that train 
accidents involving hazardous materials jumped 32 percent in a 
year but government regulators and the rail industry said safety 
has improved 
testifying before a congressional subcommittee citizen action 
released a report saying that one in seven rail accidents now 
involves toxic materials and toxic accidents on major rail lines 
jumped 75 percent in 1988 the most recent year for which complete 
data is available 
both federal railroad administration and american association of 
railroads officials said the nonprofit group used selective data 
to support its conclusions 
they told the government operations transportation subcommittee 
that train accidents in which hazardous materials were actually 
released have fallen sharply since the mid1970s and fell from 50 
in 1987 to 44 in 1988 and rose to 53 in 1989 
citizen action which claims 18 million members and has taken 
stands against insurance industry overcharging and in favor of a 
national health care program said federal railroad administration 
figures show 361 accidents involving hazardous materials in 1987 
and an increase to 475 in 1988 the group gave no number for 1989 
all of the figures come transportation department reports the 
difference is that the advocacy group includes all accidents 
involving a train carrying toxic materials and the fra and aar 
point only to accidents where hazardous materials were released 
the study makes clear that toxic rail shipments are a growing 
danger to the public said john cameron of citizen action the 
study was conducted for citizen action by illinois public action 
which found that illinois led the nation in the number of toxic 
rail accidents in 1988 
we have achieved considerable improvement in railroad safety 
during the past 12 years said gregory b mcbride fra chief 
counsel for safety adding that he thought it has been dramatic 
improvement 
mcbride accused citizen action of a significantly misleading 
use of the statistics he said the group was trying to reach a 
predetermined result with vague and not constructive findings 
william h dempsey president of aar which represents the rail 
industry said there have been dramatic improvements in the safe 
transportation of hazardous materials 
but dempsey acknowledged that railroads run the risk of having 
fairly catastrophic accidents and that is the incentive we have to 
improve safety 
between 1979 and 1988 dempsey said fatalities in train 
accidents went down 16 percent lost work time due to accidents 
declined 66 percent and train accidents dropped 69 percent

growing numbers of americans are getting their 
medical care at walkin clinics and other freestanding centers 
that are inadequately regulated to ensure quality care a 
congressional report said wednesday 
the general accounting office said states dont license or 
regulate most types of freestanding medical facilities and they 
impose few penalties when problems are uncovered at licensed 
centers 
the report was released by rep edward roybal dcalif who 
said the lack of oversight permits abuses in patient care to 
occur with increasing frequency 
when americans walk into unlicensed facilities they walk in 
with blindfolds unaware of the competence of the provider or of 
the quality of care they will receive said roybal who chairs 
the house select committee on aging and its subcommittee on health 
and longterm care 
the gao report had been requested by roybals predecessor as 
subcommittee chairman the late rep claude pepper dfla 
it covers freestanding facilities such as walkin health 
clinics 24hour emergency centers mental health centers cancer 
treatment facilities cardiac catheterization laboratories 
surgical centers and alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities 
states have been slow to license freestanding providers 
further they have limited plans to expand licensing 
requirements the gao said no one else currently fills the 
gaps consumers therefore do not have adequate assurance that 
unlicensed freestanding providers are giving quality care 
freestanding medical clinics and health maintenance 
organizations have expanded rapidly in recent years as a result of 
efforts to control health care costs developing technology and 
increased competition the gao said 
roybal noted that before costcontrol rules were imposed on 
hospitals in the early 1980s 95 percent of cataract surgeries were 
performed in hospitals he said 95 percent of the operations now 
are performed outside of hopsitals to avoid those cost controls 
a study prepared for the national conference of state 
legislatures estimated that up to 40 percent of diagnostic 
procedures and surgeries are being done outside hospitals 
among the findings in the gao report 
only montana and new york require licenses for all the types of 
healthcare centers operating in their states 
no state licenses or otherwise regulates cancer treatment 
centers or pain control centers although such centers are 
operating in 1418 states 
only virginia and california license cardiac catheterization 
laboratories although the procedure sometimes can involve 
complications that result in death stroke heart attack or 
uncontrolled hemorrhaging 
less than half the states require licenses for independent 
clinical laboratories walkin clinics or outpatient psychiatric 
centers 
states frequently did not know what types and numbers of 
freestanding clinics were operating within their borders 
the gao found that even those centers that are licensed by the 
states are subject to few sanctions in fiscal 1987 for example 
23000 freestanding health facilities were licensed by the states 
of which 165 were cited for deficiences and 28 had their licenses 
suspended or revoked 
officials in 36 states expressed concerns about the adequacy of 
their oversight of freestanding centers but most had no plans to 
regulate more facilities the gao said

space shuttle fans must 
wait until april to watch an orbiter land but officials are 
reviewing the policy that will keep atlantis arrival closed to 
public viewing nasa said wednesday 
discussions on ending the secrecy policy are being held between 
officials of the air force and the national aeronautics and space 
administration said space agency spokeswoman nancy lovato 
atlantis blasted off from cape canaveral fla early wednesday 
on a muchdelayed mission reportedly to put a 500 million spy 
satellite in orbit the flight is expected to last about four days 
and 10 hours so the shuttle should land at this mojave desert 
military base sunday morning 
the unpaved public viewing site on the east shore of rogers dry 
lake at this highdesert base has been jammed with up to 500000 
spectators during nonmilitary shuttle landings but as is the 
case on all classified shuttle missions it will be closed when 
atlantis returns to earth 
were sorry its closed but of course were due to have 
another nonclassified landing coming up in april so people are 
invited and welcome to attend the april landing lovato said 
the shuttle discovery is scheduled for launch april 12 on a 
fiveday mission to put the hubble space telescope in orbit nasa 
spokesman don haley said 
the nospectator policy for military shuttle landings has been 
under review for some time lovato said adding that she believes a 
decision is likely before the next defense department flight 
scheduled for july 
the rationale for the spectator ban isnt clear since news 
reporters and photographers have been allowed to watch and 
photograph military shuttle landings and they have done so from a 
site closer to the runway than the public viewing site 
those landings also have been televised and the shuttle 
landings are visible from sections of state highway 58 north of 
edwards air force base

prices farmers got for raw products declined 
06 percent from january to february but overall commodity index 
still averaged 27 percent more than a year ago the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
lower prices for milk eggs lettuce and wheat were mostly 
responsible for the decline from january the departments 
agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary report 
however the report said higher prices for cattle broiler and 
tomatoes partly offset the decline for the other commodities during 
the month 
tomato prices for february were at the highest level of 
records the report said during the past two months prices 
have been about twice the previous record established in march of 
1985 
the price climb was due to short supplies caused by the december 
freeze in florida in december the report said 
on the other hand the report said the drop in milk prices paid 
to farmers which had been at record levels was largest 
monthtomonth decline ever recorded and the egg price drop was 
said to be the thirdlargest on record 
the report did not include new figures on farm expenses those 
are computed every three months in january however new quarterly 
figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 11 percent from 
october the previous reading and averaged 29 percent more than a 
year earlier 
department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 
may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 billion compared with 
about 53 billion in 1989 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 44 billion to 49 
billion compared with 48 billion last year 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda economists to rise 3 
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 57 
percent in 1989 the sharpest rise since 1981 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told congress on wednesday 
that farm commodity prices are expected to be relatively 
favorable in 1990 because of strong demand and declining 
inventories of most crops he said feed grains and soybeans may be 
exceptions however 
production may rise as acreage reduction requirements for 
wheat cotton and rice are lessened bringing more acreage into 
production he told a senate appropriation subcommittee 
based on the preliminary figures the february price index for 
livestock and poultry was down 06 percent from january but was up 
82 percent from february 1989 
milk prices dropped 80 cents from january to 1490 per 100 
pounds but were still 180 more than a year ago 
crop prices overall dropped 07 percent from december and were 
29 percent below the yearearlier average 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7460 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 7370 in january and 7160 in february 1989 
those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4820 per 100 pounds compared with 4730 in 
february and 4040 a year earlier 
corn at 227 a bushel edged down from 231 in january and 
was down from 259 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 357 per bushel compared with 371 in january and 403 
a year earlier 
rice averaged 729 per 100 pounds compared with 740 in 
january and 667 in february 1989 
soybeans were 551 per bushel down from 565 in january and 
741 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 617 cents per pound up from 
598 in january and 528 a year earlier 
eggs were 704 cents per dozen compared with 838 in january 
and 621 in february 1989 
milk was 1490 per 100 pounds down from 1570 in january but 
above the average of 1310 a year ago 
broilers were 335 cents per pound live weight up from 307 
cents in january but down from 383 cents a year earlier

the white house announced wednesday that 
president bush will nominate dexter w lehtinen as us attorney 
for south florida a job he has held on an acting basis for nearly 
two years 
the nomination of the prosecutor whose tenure has been marked 
by controversy had been in limbo for months in part because of an 
fbi background check 
lehtinen 43 is a battlescarred vietnam veteran who graduated 
at the top of his class from stanford law school in 1975 
in january he indicated at first he would be the lead 
prosecutor in the drug prosecution of manuel antonio noriega the 
deposed ruler of panama he then stepped aside and appointed 
members of his office to lead the prosecution team 
the toughtalking lehtinen once created a stir by waving what he 
later said was a replica ak47 assault rifle at a meeting with 
prosecutors to dramatize the seriousness of the fight against drugs 
he is a former florida state representative and senator whose 
wife ileana roslehtinen was elected to congress last year as a 
republican to fill the miami seat left vacant by the death of rep 
claude pepper 
lehtinen worked as a justice department assistant attorney in 
california in 197577 and in miami on the miami organized crime 
strike force in 197881 
he began his career in florida state politics in 1980 then 
returned to the us attorneys office in miami in 1988 after leon 
b kellner stepped down 
the miami herald printed excerpts from his fbi background report 
in january including allegations that he had pushed his first wife 
down and abused an exgirlfriend 
the herald reported that the white house had decided to hold up 
the nomination to see if any further charges surfaced but that the 
president still intended to support lehtinen barring any new 
revelations 
the post requires senate confirmation 
the white house said bush announced his intention to 
nominate lehtinen to the job for a fouryear term 
sen connie mack rfla said wednesday he expects to support 
lehtinens nomination when it reaches the senate floor sen bob 
graham dfla had expressed reservations but said wednesday he 
is also inclined to support the nomination 
lehtinen and his wife have four children and live in miami she 
is the first cubanamerican to serve in congress

although an abc show beat cbs 60 minutes in 
ratings sunday a senior abc official said wednesday its 
simplistic to think the andy rooney controversy has caused the cbs 
shows recent ratings decline 
abcs alan wurtzel said he didnt have any research to show 60 
minutes was hurt by cbs suspension of rooney from the show after 
a gay magazine attributed a racial slur to him the humorist denies 
saying it 
its very simplistic and onedimensional to think that any one 
event triggers things like that ratings decline said wurtzel 
abcs senior vice president for research i think its a much 
more complicated thing 
60 minutes was 18th in national ratings last week beaten in 
its time period by a rerun of the premiere of abcs americas 
funniest home videos 
it was the first time in 12 years an entertainment show has 
beaten a firstrun 60 minutes broadcast in a memo to his 
staff don hewitt 60 minutes executive producer said he 
guessed the rooney flap had played a pretty big part in the 
ratings results 
60 minutes was in 11th place the previous week and in 10th 
place the week before that rooney was suspended without pay for 
three months on feb 8 cbs says the suspension still is in effect 
despite reports it may end soon 
michael eisenberg a cbs research vice president said abcs 
sunday show drew viewers because americas funniest home videos 
is a pretty hot show and would do well wherever you put it 
he noted that 60 minutes still is sixth in ratings averages 
for the season to date averaging a 33 per cent share of audience 
it averaged a 20 rating on a scale in which each ratings point 
represents 921000 homes watching a show 
wurtzel met with reporters to discuss the february ratings 
sweeps period that ended wednesday his nbc and cbs 
counterparts will hold similar sessions thursday 
his figures lacking just the last two days of ratings for the 
period didnt produce any surprises nbc continued to lead in 
prime time ratings with a 151 average rating for the period 
followed by abc with a 130 and cbs with a 126 
he ducked a question on whether he thought 60 minutes would 
continue to decline in the ratings 
noting that the show has been on the air since 1968 he said 
its still a strong show but i dont think im surprised to see 
that theres been a certain amount of slippage 
he cited as factors the cyclical nature of television and 
competition against cbs newsmagazine series from an enormous 
proliferation of similar types of programs in recent months 
wurtzel speaking of the ratings slide of the oncedominant 
cbs evening news and the rise of abcs world news tonight 
predicted that the latters string of ratings victories will 
continue 
abcs broadcast has won seven consecutive weeks in evening news 
ratings cbs program has been in third place for five of the last 
eight weeks and tied once with the nbc evening news for second 
place cbs estimates show 
in essence what we see is that cbs and nbc will be fighting 
it out for second place position for some time to come wurtzel 
said

heartconscious eaters can safely add 
monounsaturated fats to their lowfat diets but it probably wont 
reduce their cholesterol a study concludes 
researchers who compared blood cholesterol levels in groups of 
men after they followed diets with different levels of saturated 
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found that while 
monounsaturated fats dont raise cholesterol they dont lower it 
significantly either 
what we hoped to do here was try to straighten out some 
misconceptions about monos that have arisen that they had 
some independent effect on lowering cholesterol said dr henry

getting lots of potassium is no substitute for 
taking high blood pressure medicines according to a report being 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
researchers studied 287 middleage men already on medication for 
high blood pressure and put half on potassium and half on placebos 
then their regular blood pressure medicines were withdrawn 
during the next two years the men took the potassium or dummy 
supplements and followed lowsalt diets about half the people in 
both groups had to resume taking blood pressure pills because of 
rising blood pressure 
the researchers said their work suggests that potassium 
supplementation does not reduce the need for antihypertensive 
medication of men on a lowsodium diet 
the study was suggested by population research that found groups 
with high levels of potassium in their diets also tend to have 
healthy blood pressures

scientists have created a substance that blocks 
infection by viruses that cause colds a possible step toward drugs 
that could prevent or ease up to 45 percent of all colds 
but one of the studys authors steven marlin cautioned that it 
was done in the test tube and speculating on its meaning for a 
human cold is a huge leap 
in the study scientists decoyed coldcausing rhinoviruses into 
attaching themselves to a freefloating manmade version of a 
molecule that the viruses normally bind to on the surfaces of 
healthy cells thus diverting the viruses from their normal target 
by this process researchers found the manmade molecule was 
largely able to block rhinovirus infection of human cells in the 
test tube

federal rules are being changed effective march 1 to require 
proteinaceous material derived from livestock poultry eggs

agent or enhancer used for years in hot dogs will have to be 
labeled milk protein hydrolyzate

electronic fetal monitors routinely used in 
hospital delivery rooms arent any better and perhaps riskier 
than ordinary stethoscopes for monitoring the progress of babies 
during birth a study concludes 
researchers found signs that cerebral palsy may be more common 
among infants whose births are electronically monitored although 
they cautioned that this finding could be a statistical fluke 
but even if electronic monitoring isnt any worse than the 
traditional stethoscope the study failed to find evidence that it 
improves the chances of a healthy birth 
one researcher noted that in part the wide use of electronic 
monitors has taught doctors what warning signs they need to listen 
for with their stethoscopes

a drug used to prevent epileptic seizures can 
lose a third of its effectiveness if stored in humid conditions 
according to study results released wednesday by the food and drug 
administration 
the fda is asking manufacturers of the epilepsy drug 
carbamazepine to change their packaging of the drug to keep out 
moisture users of the drug should keep their supplies tightly 
closed in a cool dry place away from bathrooms showers and 
humidifiers the agency said 
the research found that when carbamazepine tablets were exposed 
to humidity they hardened and dissolved poorly in test liquids 
blood samples confirmed that carbamazepine tablets that dissolved 
poorly also were absorbed poorly by the body and were less 
effective

growth in federal financing for aids prevention

health problems and national priorities the centers for disease 
control warns in a new draft report on aids in the 1990s 
program needs can be expected to continue to grow at a pace 
that will probably exceed available resources the cdc cautioned 
we must approach our planning with an awareness of these changes 
and a willingness to change 
the cdc in a preliminary draft of its strategic plan for 
prevention of hiv infection 1990 and beyond outlines the 
agencys goals and objectives for aids 
recommendations in the plan such as proposals for increased 
testing counseling and partner notifications arent specific

mayor marion barry back in the capital for 
the first time in more than a month pleaded innocent wednesday to 
cocaine possession and perjury charges filed after an investigation 
into his ties to a convicted drug dealer 
we will not plea bargain and the mayor is not considering 
resigning barrys attorney r kenneth mundy said after the 
nineminute court proceeding the mayor is confident he will be 
vindicated at trial 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson scheduled a 
june 4 trial on three counts of perjury and five counts of 
misdemeanor possession of cocaine 
barry is enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program at the 
fenwick hall hospital outside charleston sc a senior barry aide 
speaking on condition of anonymity said barry who returned to 
washington tuesday would go back to the center later wednesday 
mundy said the mayors treatment for alcoholism was going 
well and barry was in good spirits 
barry 53 did not speak to reporters upon entering or exiting 
the courthouse 
us attorney jay b stephens would not comment on the 
possibility of a plea bargain but said that the probe was 
continuing with respect to a variety of allegations involving 
barry and various city services 
meanwhile a top city government source said prosecutors have 
delivered subpoenas to at least a dozen city agencies that have 
had dealings with eight of barrys close friends the city records 
of those barry associates were subpoenaed last week 
the new subpoenas have been issued to determine whether there 
were any irregularities in any contracts the mayors friends have 
received sources said 
subpoenas were also issued wednesday for a number of barrys 
telephone records including the period surrounding barrys arrest 
at a downtown washington hotel in january a city government source 
said 
the subpoenas for the mayors office and car telephone records 
include the periods from jan 1 1988 through march 31 1988 and 
jan 1 1989 through jan 23 1990 the source said 
barry was arrested and charged with cocaine possession in an fbi 
sting operation at a downtown washington hotel jan 18 and left for 
a florida substance abuse treatment center on jan 22 
all but one of the charges against the mayor stem from an 
investigation into barrys ties to convicted drug dealer charles 
lewis who has testified that he supplied the mayor with crack 
cocaine in december 1988 one possession charge involved the 
mayors sting operation arrest 
barry sat at the defense table reading the indictment prior to 
the start of his arraignment and did not speak as mundy entered the 
innocent pleas mundy said barrys wife effi did not attend the 
court session on his advice 
prior to the mayors arrival at the courthouse 18 guardian 
angels paraded outside chanting that the mayor should leave office 
many carried signs reading mr mayor do the right thing 
resign all were chanting barry its the time its time for 
you to resign 
reporters and cameramen were ordered by police off the plaza 
outside the main entrance to the courthouse amid fears of a repeat 
of the melee that resulted from barrys court appearance on jan 
19 the day following his arrest 
if convicted of all charges filed against him the mayor could 
face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 125 million 
fine

a witness in the alleged killing of a black 
teenager by a gang of white youths has been missing for two months 
and prosecutors will try to delay next weeks trial if he is not 
located soon a district attorney said wednesday 
the witness john vento 21 an alleged participant in the aug 
23 attack in the predominantly white bensonhurst section of 
brooklyn had agreed to testify before a grand jury and at the 
trial said brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes 
under an agreement with the former brooklyn district attorney 
in exchange for his testimony vento would not be charged in the 
attack hynes said 
he described vento as a very important witness but said his 
absence was not devastating 
its important to have vento in this case hynes said but 
if we dont find him were going to proceed 
on monday when defendants in the case are scheduled to go on 
trial prosecutors will ask state supreme court justice thaddeus 
owens to postpone the trial for a month hynes said the judge 
signed a material witness order on feb 14 directing vento to 
appear at the trial 
if vento surrenders within the next several weeks hynes said he 
would abide by the agreement but if vento refuses to voluntarily 
come forward he could face seconddegree murder charges for his 
role in the shooting death of 16yearold yusuf hawkins hynes said 
i do not choose to do that right now because im not looking 
to make this witness an antagonistic witness im looking to have 
him do the right thing and give some justice to this kid hynes 
said at a news conference 
there was no indication vento has met with foul play hynes said 
i suspect the reason he took off was a fairly uncomplicated 
one hynes said as the trial drew closer he chickened out 
hawkins was fatally shot when he and three friends all black 
were surrounded by a gang of young whites shortly after they 
arrived in bensonhurst to look at a used car 
six defendants face trial on seconddegree murder charges and a 
seventh was charged with firstdegree assault all of them except 
the alleged trigger man joseph fama 18 have been released on 
bail 
an attorney for fama stanley meyer said he would oppose an 
adjournment because the judge earlier denied defense requests for 
more time to prepare their cases 
he said he believed vento was a major component in the case 
apparently hes going to say someone put the gun in famas hands 
prosecutors learned early in january from ventos parents that 
their son had taken off during the christmas holidays hynes 
said 
police and the fbi traced vento to undisclosed locations upstate 
and in ohio but prosecutors believe he is now in the new york city 
area 
ventos lawyer gerald dichiara said i havent seen him in 
months 
he said vento may have fled after it became apparent he would 
have to testify against his friends

the us tax court on wednesday denied reputed 
chicago mob boss anthony j accardo a tax deduction for 224500 of 
legal fees incurred in winning acquittal on racketeering charges 
accardo contended that the fees were deductible on grounds that 
he had spent the money to prevent government confiscation of his 
incomeproducing bank accounts 
the court noted that accardo does not explain why he believes 
that none of his legal fees were incurred to conserve and maintain 
his other nonincomeproducing property condominiums in 
illinois and california or to keep him out of jail 
no part of the legal fees is deductible the court held 
petitioners accardos situation is no different from that of 
any defendant in a criminal or civil trial who faces a potential 
fine or monetary judgment that must be paid out of incomeproducing 
assets such as savings accounts certificates of deposit or 
stocks 
accardo was acquitted in miami in 1982 of racketeering charges 
alleging a kickback conspiracy in affairs of the laborers union

president daniel ortega declared a 
halt to attacks on the contras wednesday and called again on the 
united states to help dismantle the rebel force 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro who joined ortega 
on tuesday in asking the usbacked contras to put down their 
arms praised his move as a step forward 
the causes of civil war in nicaragua have disappeared mrs 
chamorro told a news conference there is no reason for war 
she said the contras most of them based in neighboring 
honduras must lay down their weapons and come home to work for 
the reconstruction of nicaragua 
ortega said in a statement that he ordered all offensive 
military operations against the contras to halt he said the united 
states should help pay for demobilizing and relocating the rebels 
mrs chamorro upset ortega in an election on sunday that he 
agreed to as part of a central american plan for ending the war and 
which he clearly expected to win 
demobilizing the contras is the trickiest issue in transition 
talks that began tuesday between mrs chamorros 14party 
coalition the united national opposition and the stunned 
sandinistas who have been in power for 10 years 
sandinista officials say they cannot give up control of the 
armed forces and police both party organs as long as the 
10000man contra army is intact 
mrs chamorro made it clear she expects ortega to keep his 
promise to turn over power and that her government plans to run the 
army and security forces 
im the one who is going to give orders said the 
silverhaired widow who was chosen to run against ortega because 
of her powerful symbolic value 
the 1978 death of her husband opposition publisher pedro 
joaquin chamorro touched off the revolution that overthrew 
dictator anastasio somoza and put the sandinistas in power 
she said the sandinistas have to turn over everything 
including the armed forces the traditional source of real power 
in latin america 
the minister of defense will be a civilian she declared 
the current minister gen humberto ortega the presidents 
brother leads the sandinista transition team mrs chamorros 
soninlaw and campaign manager antonio lacayo heads the united 
national opposition team 
the transition talks are expected to be complex and delicate 
ortega laid out tough sandinista positions on tuesday before 
thousands of cheering party members 
he demanded demobilization of the contras and said the party 
would defend the integrity and the professionalism of the army 
and the police forces 
mrs chamorro campaigned on a platform that promised an end to 
the draft and drastic cuts in the armed forces which soviet aid 
has built into the most powerul military machine in the region 
the statement from the sandinista leadership also challenged 
privatization a major plank in the uno platform 
francisco mayorga an economic adviser to mrs chamorro said 
the new government would not return banks to private ownership 
the banks will stay nationalized he said in a brief 
interview while waiting for mrs chamorros news conference to 
begin 
mayorga said he was going to new york and washington this week 
at the head of an uno delegation seeking funds to help nicaragua 
rebuild 
the economy has been savaged by the civil war a us economic 
embargo and poor management 
the bush administration which backed uno has said mrs 
chamorros victory means it will lift the embargo 
mrs chamorros running mate virgilio godoy told reporters he 
suspects the sandinistas of trying to alter election returns to 
affect the outcome of the national assembly races 
but former us attorney general elliot richardson leader of 
the united nations election monitoring team said nothing was amiss 
with the vote count 
everything is normal he said by telephone 
richardson said final results should be released within days 
preliminary results based on returns from 82 percent of the 
precincts indicate mrs chamorro took 552 percent of the vote to 
ortegas 408 percent with the remainder going to minor party 
nominees 
uno won 52 seats in the national assembly while the sandinistas 
got 39 including one awarded to ortega as a presidential candidate 
who got at least 1 percent of the vote according to preliminary 
figures 
depending on final returns moises hassan of the revolutionary 
unity movement may also qualify for a seat as a losing presidential 
candidate which would mean a 92member assembly 
the 240member un team was one of hundreds of organizations 
monitoring sundays general elections

the centers for disease control is 
recommending that aids and virtualy all other contagious diseases 
be dropped as reasons for preventing foreigners from entering the 
united states a federal health official said wednesday 
the cdcs action on aids is largely symbolic however because 
the list still would include infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids that restriction 
was imposed by congress 
the recommendation by the cdc to remove aids is seen as 
signaling congress that they should take hiv off the list as 
well said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
along with aids the cdc is recommending removing from the list 
all other contagious diseases except infectious tuberculosis the 
source said 
after a review of the diseases on the list including syphilis 
gonorrhea and leprosy the cdc decided that only tuberculosis posed 
an important threat because it is highly contagious in its active 
stage 
while aids is also contagious certain behavior such as sexual 
contact or needlesharing is required to transmit the virus 
efforts are underway in congress to give the administration 
complete discretion as to what diseases to put on the list 
however an aide on the senate labor and human resources committee 
said its still an open question whether an act of congress is 
required 
the immigration regulations concerning aids have been protested 
by aids activist groups including the national commission on aids 
and the world health organization 
several groups including the national association of people 
with aids have said they will boycott two major aids conferences 
in the united states this year unless the restrictions are changed 
dr james mason assistant secretary for health at the 
department of health and human services asked the cdc to review 
the diseases on the immigrationrestriction list and recommend 
changes the list had not been reviewed since 1977 
after consulting with outside medical experts the cdc 
recommended that all but tuberculosis be dropped from the list if 
mason approves the recommendation the change would be published in 
the federal register before taking effect

us trade representative carla hills said 
wednesday the administration was moving quickly to negotiate 
preferential trade agreements to support the new reform governments 
in eastern europe 
but she cautioned that the success of the new governments would 
depend on the extent of internal reforms rather than outside 
assistance from other western nations 
in congressional testimony hills said that it was crucial for 
the new leaders in eastern europe to realize that minimal 
measures to reform a command economy simply will not work real 
substantive change is the best hope 
she said each formerly communist government needed to institute 
marketoriented reforms emphasizing private ownership and 
decentralized economic decisionmaking along with providing 
adequate protections for foreign investors 
the degree and the speed of economic reform in these centrally 
planned economies will be the determining factor in whether their 
economies develop and their products are able to become competitive 
in world markets she told members of the house ways and means 
committee 
the administration has already begun funneling economic 
assistance to poland and hungary while making plans to provide help 
for other eastern european nations as well 
hills said the administration was in various stages of the 
negotiating process to enact new trade treaties granting the 
countries most favored nation status which qualifies them for the 
lowest tariffs granted to any nation with which america trades 
poland and hungary have already been granted the most favored 
nation designation and the administration two weeks ago launched 
negotiations with the soviet union aimed at awarding the soviets 
similar status 
hills said the second round of the soviet trade talks would be 
held in london on thursday and friday a third session is scheduled 
for later in march and hills repeated the administrations goal of 
having a treaty ready for signing at the next summit meeting 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev in 
june 
granting the soviets the lower tariffs hinges on final approval 
by the soviet parliament of a liberalized emigration law 
several members of the committee questioned hills about the 
refusal of the soviets to allow direct commercial airline flights 
from the soviet union to israel saying american trade negotiators 
should push for these flights in order to facilitate jewish 
emigration from the country 
hills said that secretary of state james a baker iii had raised 
this issue with the soviets but that the administration did not 
want the trade normalization effort to hinge on the airline issue

democrats prevailed wednesday in the years 
first congressional battle over the socalled peace dividend 
pushing language through the senate recommending that defense 
budget savings be used to slash the federal deficit 
in the second of a pair of votes a republican alternative 
urging the use of the moneys to cut taxes was defeated by majority 
democrats 
the fight was over a competing pair of nonbinding resolutions 
and was therefore largely symbolic nonetheless it provided a 
preview of a partisan dispute likely to reverberate through 
congress for years what to do with billions of dollars in planned 
military spending that have been made unnecessary by easing 
eastwest tensions 
the senate voted 7919 for language by liberal democrats led by 
sens edward kennedy dmass and james sasser dtenn urging 
the senate to use defense savings mainly to help balance the 
federal budget as lesser priorities they said the savings should 
also be used to address urgent national priorities such as 
antidrug and education efforts and to cut taxes for working men 
and women 
minutes later senators voted 5048 against a rival proposal 
from 12 gop conservatives led by sen phil gramm of texas 
recommending that money siphoned from the pentagons budget be 
returned to americas taxpayers the republicans said that would 
include tax deductions for child care a capital gains tax rate 
cut a lowering of other tax rates and additional ideas 
democrats argued that the large tax cuts of 1981 did not improve 
the nations economy and that the country has too many unaddressed 
problems 
its high time we quit squandering the treasury of this nation 
for overly sophisticated weapons systems sasser said we need 
to take this peace dividend and we need to apply these funds 
wisely 
republicans countered that in the years following the vietnam 
war moneys taken from the pentagon budget were spent fruitlessly 
by congress a scenario that should be avoided 
the term peace dividend while widely used can be 
misleading technically with the government running large deficits 
each year reductions in the pentagons budget will not leave the 
government with surplus dollars to spend the congressional budget 
office expects the deficit in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
to be 138 billion 
nonetheless since the warsaw pact began deteriorating late last 
year lawmakers have been arguing over what to do with the money 
that everyone had assumed would be used for defense spending 
in his budget for the fiscal year that will begin oct 1 
president bush proposed pentagon spending of 2921 billion that 
is 53 billion more than is being spent this year but 39 billion 
below the amount that would have been needed to keep pace with 
inflation 
most democrats and some republicans have said bushs request is 
too high and most lawmakers expect congress to approve a figure 
that is several billion dollars lower 
the resolutions were offered as amendments to a bill that would 
allow the government to spend 125 million to set up programs for 
volunteers 
in the 7919 vote by which the senate adopted the democratic 
peace dividend resolution those voting no were

a bombing campaign blamed on basque 
separatists terrorized madrid on wednesday as a parcel blew up at 
the main post office and an explosive sent to a government 
prosecutor was discovered 
police said two postal workers were injured one seriously in 
the post office explosion the second bomb was defused before it 
went off police said 
on tuesday the president of the national court which tries all 
terrorism cases was seriously injured when a package delivered to 
his madrid home blew up as he opened it another package bomb 
delivered tuesday to a retired army officer in valencia was 
discovered and detonated by bomb experts without causing injuries 
the explosions destroyed hopes of renewed talks between the 
government and the basque separatist group eta which police 
suspect is behind the attacks eta which in basque language stands 
for homeland and liberty seeks autonomy for the threeprovince 
basque region of northern spain 
the post office blast occurred in the firstfloor sorting room 
where maria del pilar was working doctors at gregorio maranon 
hospital said she was in serious condition and had lost a finger 
suffered burns on her neck and face and sustained injuries to both 
eyes 
another postal worker was deafened in one ear doctors said 
later a letter bomb was defused in a madrid police laboratory 
after it was discovered by a bodyguard of prosecutor eduardo 
fungairino a police official said 
fungairino investigated etas bloodiest action a june 1987 car 
bombing that killed 21 people in the parking garage of a barcelona 
department store 
judge fernando de mateo lage of the national court or audiencia 
nacional underwent surgery following tuesdays blast mateo lage 
60 lost both his hands had severe lung complications and was in 
danger of losing his sight doctors said 
although no group claimed responsibility for the attacks police 
have blamed eta which has used package bombs in the past in 
september eta gunmen ambushed and killed antiterrorist prosecutor 
carmen tagle who worked at the national court 
it is obvious that eta is still mounting attacks against 
society and while there are attacks there will be no changes in 
antiterrorist policy interior minister jose luis corcuera said 
tuesday 
the package bomb that injured mateo lage was mailed friday the 
same day corcuera said the government would respond favorably if 
the basque group halted attacks for six months 
eta has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people 
since it began its independence campaign 21 years ago 
also on wednesday nine soldiers were slightly injured in an 
explosion of gun powder in a storage area in the spanish enclave of 
melilla on the north coast of morocco most of them cut by glass 
sources for the military hospital there said 
the cause of the explosion was not immediately known but a fire 
was believed the reason 
other military sources said the blast damaged a television relay 
and telephone lines 
the sources demanded anonymity

the ranking republican on the house armed 
services committee is warning president bush that without a 
concerted effort for his fiscal 1991 defense budget administration 
priorities will be undermined 
your supporters on capitol hill will obviously do everything 
possible to defend your priorities but our chances of success are 
dismal without your aggressive handson participation rep 
william dickinson rala said in a threepage letter to bush 
dated monday 
dickinson said that for the past two years congress and the 
white house have reached an agreement on a total for defense 
spending but the chances for such an agreement this year are not 
promising at this point in time 
in addition several democratic lawmakers are suggesting cuts of 
10 billion to 12 billion in the bush administrations proposed 
defense budget of 292 billion for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
dickinson noted that even if congress cancels the major 
strategic modernization programs such as the b2 stealth bomber 
the two landbased nuclear missiles and the trident submarine as 
well as the advanced tactical fighter and the c17 transport plane 
the savings wont add up to the amount many members are seeking 
the cuts instead would have to come from personnel and 
readiness the very essence of the us military dickinson 
said 
dickinson predicted that congress facing a diminishing soviet 
threat to the west and an increasing budget deficit will provide 
funds for only one of the two landbased nuclear missiles the 
administration wants 
the congressman said that without the presidents leadership 
i fear the national security policies and priorities that you and 
i both support will be compromised by an unfocused congress hoping 
to reduce defense spending and demanding to micromanage whatever 
is left

former secretary of state edmund s muskie on 
wednesday criticized the bush administrations policy on cambodia 
saying it could lead to a return of tragedy in the nation 
muskie also said the united states should grant diplomatic 
recognition to vietnam which he said is more interested these days 
in economic development that military expansion 
the former democratic senator from maine told the senate foreign 
relations committee that he is perplexed by us policy on 
cambodia where efforts are under way to find a new government 
muskie recently toured cambodia under the auspices of the center 
for national policy a nonpartisan research group 
from the conversations i had and from my own observations i 
have concluded that a fundamental redirection of us policy must 
take place if we are not to contribute to a return of tragedy in 
this nation he said 
specifically muskie objected to allowing the khmer rouge any 
kind of political role in the country prior to national elections 
there 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge a wellarmed guerrilla force 
were responsible hundreds of thousands of deaths between 1975 and 
1978 when they were ousted by vietnamese occupation forces 
my view is that i would rather have the khmer rouge outside 
muskie said 
the khmer rouge and two noncommunist guerrilla groups backed by 
the united states are battling the vietnaminstalled government of 
premier hun sen 
vietnam said it withdrew the last of its troops from cambodia 
last fall but there have been allegations that some soldiers and 
advisers have returned to help support government troops 
the united states and britain france china and the soviet 
union have advocated a plan proposed by australia to have the 
united nations run cambodia until elections and to deploy an 
international peacekeeping force to ensure security 
the khmer rouge hold cambodias seat at the un general 
assembly 
muskie said that it became clear that the central question for 
us policy had to be simply this why should we insist on 
dismantling the existing government prior to elections and thereby 
risk the return of chaos 
but david lambertson the deputy assistant secretary of state 
defended the us policy while the united states is unalterably 
opposed to the abhorrent khmer rouge he said they were a 
unpleasant reality who had to be addressed 
he said the state departments is convinced that only a 
negotiated political settlement with a substantial un 
peacekeeping force can provide the assurances which the cambodian 
people and the international community demand

its no mystery whos been stealing us 
flags from graves at wellsboro cemetery but its doubtful the 
thief will be arrested 
the culprit is a gray squirrel said robert gee who lives near 
the cemetery in this north central pennsylvania city 
the problem began last fall when the furry flagrazer swooped 
down from its perch in one of the cemeterys many evergreens 
stripped one of the miniature flags from its standard and returned 
aloft the flag trailing behind him 
so far the rampaging rodent has taken more than 20 flags and 
scattered them randomly among the pine trees branches giving the 
tree an almost festive appearance 
gee cant figure out how to end the squirrely crime wave but 
hes certain the flags will be replaced before memorial day

nbc nightly news commentator john 
chancellor erroneously referred to former gov george c wallace as 
the late governor but that didnt bother wallace his 
spokesman said wednesday 
newsmen have been making mistakes about george wallace all of 
his life said spokesman elvin stanton its something he 
brushes off 
during chancellors commentary tuesday night he quoted wallace 
as once saying governors were nothing more than ornaments 
chancellor then said well its too bad the late governor wasnt 
here in washington this week for a national governors conference 
nbc spokeswoman katherine mcquay said the mistake was corrected 
during the 6 pm cst feed of the national news the nbc affiliate 
in montgomery wsfatv carried a verbal apology from the network 
during its local broadcast 
stanton said he did not call nbc because he knew enough people 
were aware wallace was still alive 
wallace who lives in montgomery has kept a low profile since 
leaving office in january 1987 after four fouryear terms partly 
because of health problems stemming from a 1972 assassination 
attempt

a study showing that a vietnamera program 
failed to help lowaptitude soldiers in later civilian life was 
disputed in congressional testimony wednesday opening a debate on 
whether the military can promote social improvement 
the house veterans affairs subcommittee hearing concerned 
project 100000 under which defense secretary robert s 
mcnamara tried to fight the vietnam war and the war on poverty in 
one action 
rep lane evans dill chairman of the subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations said he wanted to determine whether 
project 100000 was a legitimate great society social program 
or was project 100000 a calculated even cynical means to 
satisfy the manpower needs of the armed forces and at the same time 
lessen domestic opposition to the war in vietnam he asked 
under the program the pentagon lowered the physical and mental 
standards for entry into the armed services in exchange the new 
members of the service were promised remedial education and 
training 
about 300000 enlisted under that program from 1966 to 1971 
twothirds in the army fiftyfour percent were volunteers 
half came from the south more than 40 percent were members of 
minority groups the average reading ability was at the sixth grade 
level 
most went to combat or to soft skill jobs such as food 
service supply wire communications motor transport and 
automotive repair 
flaws in the enlistment test allowed another group of about 
300000 also lacking the traditional qualifications to enter the 
military from 1976 to 1980 
according to the study the project 100000 veterans wound up 
earning 5000 to 7000 less per year than their nonveteran 
counterparts veterans were more likely to be unemployed less 
likely to be married and more likely to have been divorced 
the lowaptitude veterans who served from 1976 to 1980 were not 
found to be better off economically educationally or socially than 
their nonveteran counterparts there were no significant 
differences in unemployment kinds of jobs held or average income 
the report said 
but the veterans had less formal education higher divorce rates 
and were more likely to be unhappy with their jobs 
project 100000s social promises were not kept social 
scientist janice h laurence testified 
laurence is a senior scientist with human resources research 
organization the alexandria vabased group that conducted the 
study for the defense department 
she suggested that two years in the military was not enough time 
to counter characteristics acquired over 18 years of growing up 
she noted that 4 percent of the project 100000 continued with 
military careers while evans noted that many were denied 
reenlistment because of subsequent low test scores 
to compensate for the deficits which the underprivileged bring 
with them would require more than a little extra training and 
maybe even a complete restructuring of current pedagogical 
practices or content she said 
the results were disputed by researcher william e beusse who 
studied project 100000 army veterans in the early 1970s and 
reached opposite conclusions 
beusse said he used a far stricter sampling methods producing 
more accurate results he acknowledged that veterans would have 
lost seniority and the opportunity to enter a tight job market 
in an age of dramatically reduced threat the cost of even a 
scaleddown peacetime force may be too expensive for defense to 
be its only product beusse argued society may come to demand 
that the military assist in addressing other national needs such as 
providing largescale manpower training for low aptitude men and 
women in this area the military has more than proven its 
capability to perform 
wayne s sellman head of recruiting policy for the pentagon 
said he believed the longterm decline in performance by 
lowaptitude veterans may have been due to the gradual distancing 
from the discipline and highly organized life that the military 
provided point also made by laurence 
he said sellmans study caught veterans fresh from the service 
while laurence caught them later

francisco will be ram dass the former harvard professor who has 
blended eastern philosophy and spiritualism into a unique 
prescription for social action

creating our future established in 1987 the group helps high 
school students organize to tackle issues like homelessness 
offshore oil drilling and the preservation of rain forests

plans to attend camp again this summer social activism includes a 
vegetarian diet boycotting products made by companies whose 
policies she shuns and being a conscientious recycler 
ive made my life a statement of how i want the world to be

gasoline only from small independent stations 
camp is an opportunity for young people to meet each other 
learn from veteran social activists of the 60s era and expand the 
network of youths who care about changing the world litaker said 
last year campers helped produce a manual titled how to 
organize a rainforest awareness week at your school 
the camp has become so popular that organizers have increased 
the number of spaces from 30 last year to about 100 this summer

colleagues of a newspaper director 
and a police official met wednesday to discuss the terms of a duel 
over a news article that the official claims falsely accuses him of 
smuggling 
last friday police inspector saul claveria from san jose 
province challenged the director of the la republica newspaper to a 
duel over the story which appeared jan 24 in the splashy leftist 
tabloid 
the director frederico fasano derided the challenge as 
anachronistic and medieval but on tuesday he agreed however 
he said would only show up at the duel not defend himself 
the article in dispute alleged that two cars involved in 
distributing contraband consumer items were registered under 
claverias name claveria insisted the cars had belonged to the 
police department but that they were sold months ago he 
acknowledged he had signed papers connecting him to the cars but 
said they were connected to the sale 
the vehicles apparently belong to a car rental agency 
fasano who lived in exile in mexico during much of uruguays 
197385 military dictatorship said the story technically was not 
incorrect and refused to retract it last saturday the interior 
ministry approved claverias request for a duel 
the developments have received prominent coverage by the 
national media 
wednesdays meeting of the colleagues or seconds of each 
man was required by a 1939 law that regulates dueling in this 
south american nation if it takes place the duel would be the 
first in uruguay in 18 years 
if the seconds agree to proceed they must designate a tribunal 
that would arrange a site witnesses doctors and other details 
the outcome of the meeting was not disclosed by tradition 
neither participant nor his seconds may comment publicly on 
developments after the challenge has been issued and accepted 
duels have a long history in uruguay in one of the most famous 
twotime president jose batlle y ordonez challenged the director of 
the newspaper el pais washington baltran 70 years ago also over 
a published article he shot and killed him 
in 1970 julio m sanguinetti now uruguays president fought a 
saber duel with another member of the fractious colorado party 
sen manuel flores mora the latter was grazed on the arm and the 
duel was halted 
the most recent duel occurred in 1972 when two retired generals 
faced off over a political dispute 
witnesses said liber seregni leader of the broad front 
coalition of leftist parties intentionally aimed high and missed 
juan ribas a presidential candidate in 1958 and 1971 from a 
splinter group of the colorado party 
ribas however took careful aim and fired and his bullet just 
missed the head of his rival

as many as 37 million young americans could 
be eligible for the new belowminimum training wage that takes 
effect april 1 along with the first increase in the minimum wage 
since 1981 the labor department said wednesday 
but few employers will develop training programs that will 
permit them to pay the lower wage beyond the 90day limit the 
department predicted 
only firms that develop onthejob training programs may pay 
workers 16 to 19 the lower wage for a second 90day period 
starting april 1 employers can pay teenagers new to the job 
market 335 an hour thats the same amount as the current minimum 
wage which will increase to 380 an hour on april 1 1991 the 
regular minimum wage will go to 425 an hour while the training 
wage will rise to 361 
guidelines announced by the department wednesday require 
employers who want to pay the lower wage for the second 90day 
period to develop training programs that provide knowledge and 
skills beyond those customarily learned by observation and 
incidental work exposure 
the programs must include training for both jobspecific 
skills such as cleaning equipment or running a cash register 
and personal skills such as courtesy and punctuality the 
guidelines said 
when congress debated the measure last year democrats opposed a 
training wage but were forced to concede the point to president 
bush to avoid a veto democrats also had to scale back their final 
minimumwage target since bush had vetoed a measure earlier that 
called for an increase to 455 an hour 
in return bush agreed to have the minimum wage reach 425 nine 
months earlier than he had proposed and also accepted a far more 
restricted training wage than he sought earlier 
originally bush had wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid 
to all workers regardless of age for their first six months on 
any new job regardless of past work experience

nearly five years after terry anderson was taken 
hostage in lebanon his sister said wednesday she believes the 
united states iran and syria are moving on a common track toward 
freedom for all 18 western captives 
im just going to pray and hold my breath that nothing 
disastrous occurs before this can reach fruition said peggy say 
winding up a 2week trip to europe and the middle east that she 
called a humanitarian pilgrimage 
my personal sense is not tomorrow not next week maybe not 
next month but certainly soon she said 
anderson 42 s the chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press he was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
mrs says journey with an associated press delegation included 
meetings with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar pope 
john paul ii palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat and two syrian ministers 
she said she felt optimistic that the hostages will be freed 
i think that with my reassurances that the american 
administration is doing everything it can do that the syrians are 
certainly pledged 100 percent with their commitment to resolve it 
and with the statements coming out of tehran to say nothing of the 
mood in the world today it just gives me a feeling of hope she 
said 
but in washington john kelly assistant secretary of state for 
near eastern and south asian affairs said he was not optimistic 
the hostages would be released soon 
i think the chances are very slim he told members of the 
house subcommittee on europe and the middle east while he said he 
hopes reports of possible movement are accurate the relatives of 
the hostages have been disappointed in the past 
they get their hopes up and then get them dashed he said 
mrs say spoke at a news conference after meeting archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie whose personal envoy terry waite was 
kidnapped in beirut on jan 20 1987 while trying to negotiate the 
release of western hostages 
mrs say recalled that at her first meeting with runcie and 
waite there was a mood of optimism that waites mission would be 
successful 
i must admit that i feel some responsibility and was just 
devastated when terry waite was kidnapped she said i hope 
when all the hostages come out certainly i hope terry waite is 
with them 
eve keatley a spokeswoman for the archbishop said runcie was 
very pleased to hear of peggys growing optimism after her trip 
mrs say concluded her trip at a private dinner with the 
families of waite and other british hostages and scottish 
relatives of american hostage thomas sutherland the hostages 
missing in lebanon include eight americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
she said this trip her fourth to the middle east was the first 
that didnt leave her feeling extremely depressed and thinking 
this situation only gets more and more complicated 
after meetings in syria with foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
and information minister mohammed salman she said i have no 
doubts about syrias commitment certainly if anyone wants it over 
with more than the united states its certainly syria 
she said she found it very very encouraging that syrian 
television carried a lengthy interview with her in which she said 
relations with the united states would not improve until the 
hostages are freed 
she was heartened by a commentary last week in the tehran times 
which usually reflects the thinking of president hashemi 
rafsanjani that the hostages should be freed on sunday irans 
chief justice mohammad yazdi said that islam opposes hostagetaking 
another positive sign she said was an appeal friday by sheik 
mohammed hussein fadlallah the most influential shiite moslem 
leader in lebanon for a new approach to freeing the hostages 
fadlallah is the spiritual guide to the iranianaligned hezbollah 
or party of god which is believed to be an umbrella organization 
for most of the hostagetakers 
everywhere i went i was assured that the americans are doing 
the very best they can she added 
i back my administration for the first time in a long long 
time in their stance which is number one that the hostages be 
released before there is any move towards reconciliation or any 
economic contact with iran and secondly that they are not going 
to pay ransom mrs say said 
i feel certain that there is going to be nothing shameful 
about the deal that is going to be made to release these 
hostages nobodys going to be caught at anything we suffered our 
irancontra thank you very much it devastated us she said 
i did my part and now if everybody does their part we can all 
wrap our arms around the hostages and go home she said 
mrs say has been accompanied on her trip by larry heinzerling 
deputy director of world services for the ap which supports her 
efforts financially and logistically while pressing its own efforts 
for andersons freedom 
the leading arab newspaper alhayat published in london 
reported tuesday there had been progress in discussions between the 
united states iran and syria aimed at freeing the hostages the 
lebanese newspaper said the highlevel contacts were taking place 
in geneva between us and iranian officials 
the newspaper quoted algerian sources as saying that contacts 
were in place through nondiplomatic organizations and that algeria 
was helping in the process 
the algerian government refused wednesday to disclose what steps 
it might be taking 
kelly denied reports that the united states was involved in 
negotiations although he said the issue has come up once or twice 
when abraham sofaer the state departments legal adviser met with 
iranians in the hague where a international tribunal is tryin to 
resolve financial disputes 
but kelly said sofaer simply reiterates the us position on the 
hostages he is not repeat not negotiating in the hague with 
the iranians kelly said 
as for the syrians sofaer said i believe they could be more 
helpful i dont believe the syrians are being an obstacle in 
any way

agrarian party officials said wednesday 
their group will merge with a rival party in a move expected to 
make them the favorites over the communists in bulgarias first 
free elections in more than 42 years 
alexander petriny chairman of a joint contact group of the two 
rivals told reporters the bulgarian agrarian peoples union and 
the bulgarian agrarian peoples unionnikola petkov agreed to join 
forces 
with 150000 registered members and a strong rural voice the 
united bulgarian agrarian peoples union was expected to displace 
the communist party from its role as favorite in elections planned 
for july 
the two parties began discussing fusion shortly after hardline 
communist leader todor zhivkov was toppled in november but 
differences at times appeared unbridgeable 
the agrarian party became a loyal junior partner of the 
communists following the communist takeover in december 1947 but 
began reasserting its independence after democratic reforms started 
late last year 
the nikola petkov group named after an executed party founder 
is one of more than a dozen opposition parties newly formed or 
reactivated in the new climate of relative permissiveness 
it had criticized its rivals support of the communists and had 
made fusion conditional on a change in agrarian party leadership 
some of whom continue to hold high office to which they were 
appointed under zhivkov agrarian party leader angel dimitrov for 
instance remains vice president of the state council the supreme 
body of state power 
petriny said the party had formally dissociated itself from the 
communists but he could not specify what the agrariancommunist 
relations were to the umbrella union of democratic forces of which 
the nikola petkov organization is a member 
other officials said the two rivals agreed to formation of a 
provisional leadership of a united party pending a special 
unification congress tenatively scheduled for march 24 
delegates at an agrarian party congress wednesday overwhelmingly 
approved a resolution to end participation in the patriotic front 
to further distance themselves from the communists the front is a 
mass organization set up by the communists and made up of groups 
supporting them

a top state department official on wednesday 
reiterated the bush administrations opposition to allowing new 
jewish immigrants from the soviet union to settle in israels 
occupied territories 
the policy statement to congress came as an israeli cabinet 
official was assuring secretary of state james a baker iii that 
israel does not plan to settle soviet jewish immigrants in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip sources said 
the statements to baker were relayed by sources familiar with 
the meeting of the secretary and yitzhak peretz the minister in 
charge of resettling immigrants 
we have said repeatedly we dont want to see the expansion of 
settlements in the west bank asistant secretary of state john 
kelly told the house subcommittee on europe and the middle east 
kellys comments came as israeli media quoted yasha kazakov an 
israeli official as saying 230000 jews from the soviet union 
could settle in israel this year 
so far about 9400 have arrived over the last two months as a 
result of more liberalized emigration policies in the soviet union 
and growing fears of antisemitism 
arab nations have urged the kremlin to restrict jewish 
emigration because they fear the new arrivals will be resettled in 
the territories occupied by israel after the 1967 arabisraeli war 
in talks with arab leaders kelly said he was convinced that 
their major concern is resettlement of soviet jews in the 
territories not simply the fact that the jews were arriving 
rep tom lantos dcalif challenged kelly about the 
administrations position on resettlement of soviet jews in the 
west bank or gaza 
he said it was a preposterous notion that a democratic society 
should exclude its citizens from living where they want but 
kelly said expansion of the settlements could undermine efforts for 
peace 
he also said the administration has not taken a position on 
proposed legislation that would guarantee 400 million in loans for 
new housing for the immigrants in israel 
baker told peretz that he hoped israel would respond favorably 
soon to proposals for holding talks on elections among the 
palestinians of the west bank and gaza according to the sources 
reporting on the talks on condition that they not be identified 
peretz an ultraorthodox rabbi also told baker at their brief 
meeting that the future status of jerusalem as israels capital was 
inviolate and was off limits in any negotiations with palestinians 
the united states refuses to recognize jerusalem as the capital 
saying the status of the city must be resolved in international 
negotiations israel captured the eastern part of jerusalem in 1967 
from jordan and has since annexed it 
baker has expressed impatience with israels failure to respond 
to his proposals for talks to set up elections among the 17 
million palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
the likud party which is the senior partner in israels ruling 
coalition is in disarray over the proposal hardliners fear talks 
with a palestinian delegation could result in israel being forced 
to talk to the palestine liberation organization which israel 
shuns as a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of 
israel 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu met this week with 
state department officials and offered his assessment that israel 
should insist on assurances from the united states that it would 
not be forced to speak with the plo 
netanyahu told reporters he would recommend to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir that israel refuse to conduct preliminary talks with 
egypt and the united states on palestinian elections until that 
point is clear 
us officials say they cannot give israel such assurances 
because if palestinians want the plo to represent them the united 
states would not interfere 
in a twohour meeting with dennis ross one of bakers top 
aides peretz said that the israeli government does not channel 
immigrants to the west bank and gaza 
but he urged baker to keep up the pressure on moscow to allow 
direct flights between moscow and tel aviv so that jews wishing to 
emigrate could do so faster the sources said

parties to run candidates as long as avril remains in power many 
critics of the government doubt that avril really intends to usher

a former food and drug administration official 
says he was sent a 300 color television set by a generic drug 
company that was trying to get products approved by the agency but 
he returned it according to transcripts of testimony released 
wednesday 
martin seife former director of the food and drug 
administrations generic drug division told a house investigations 
subcommittee the incident occurred in 1974 when he was a reviewer 
in the division 
seife said he received a package in the mail at his home from 
bolar pharmaceutical co inc of copiague ny and when he 
unwrapped it he was shocked and chagrined to find a color tv 
set 
he said he sent it back immediately and nobody ever approached 
me in this manner again 
included in the transcripts was a letter to seife from robert 
shulman then president of bolar apologizing for an unfortunate 
incident that im sure embarrassed both of us shulman recently 
resigned 
the letter explained i just meant to say thank you to someone 
i felt had shown us some understanding and compassion that he 
didnt have to 
eugene pfeifer a washington dc attorney representing bolar 
said he was aware of the incident but added we have no reason to 
believe it was a practice were not aware of anything else like 
that 
such a gift would be considered an illegal gratuity though the 
statute of limitations on prosecution has expired the transcripts 
have been turned over to the us attorney in baltimore for 
determination as to whether it represents part of a pattern of 
conduct said a subcommittee source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
seife testified in secret before the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee on may 3 last year 
seife who recently retired from the fda has been a principal 
source for the subcommittee which uncovered allegations of fraud 
bribery and mismanagement in the fdas generic drug division 
the scandal became public last spring and led to bribery 
convictions of three generic drug company executives and 
bribetaking convictions of three fda employees 
the investigation also uncovered evidence that some drug 
companies had cheated on fda potency tests which prompted recalls 
of dozens of generic drugs including both generic versions of the 
widely prescribed highbloodpressure drug dyazide 
bolar recalled its version of dyazide in january after the 
companys lawyers said documents supporting claims about the drug 
appeared to be false

lawyers for juan ponce enrile asked 
the supreme court on wednesday to free the opposition senator who 
was arrested on charges of backing decembers failed coup 
vice president salvador laurel described the arrest of the 
former defense minister as an attempt to silence the opposition 
laurel broke with president corazon aquino in 1987 and later joined 
enrile in forming the opposition nacionalista party 
it could only be the beginning laurel told reporters it 
is not the end we are bracing for that we are prepared for the 
worst i think mrs aquino is exacerbating the fragmentation 
and disunity of the nation 
enrile who played a key role in bringing mrs aquino to power 
in a 1986 uprising was arrested tuesday held overnight at the 
national bureau of investigation and transferred early wednesday 
to police headquarters in suburban quezon city he faces charges of 
rebellion with murder 
military dissidents claimed the arrest of one of the 
administrations sharpest critics was a prelude to martial law 
in a petition filed wednesday enriles law partner renato 
cayetano claimed the arrest was illegal and violated the senators 
rights the petition asked that enrile be freed 
court officials said no hearing had been scheduled 
also wednesday three senators filed a proposal asking judicial 
authorities to place enrile under the custody of the senates 
sergeantatarms to allow the lone opposition senator to attend 
sessions 
enrile who was among seven people indicted tuesday denied any 
role in the dec 19 coup attempt that left at least 113 people 
dead and wounded more than 600 
indicted with 66yearold enrile were dismissed lt col 
gregorio gringo honasan rodolfo aguinaldo suspended governor 
of cagayan province ret brig gen felix brawner retired lt 
col billy bibit and businessman rebecco panlilio and his wife 
erlinda

coup attempts since mrs aquino was swept to power in february 1986 
by the militarypopular uprising that drove the late president 
ferdinand e marcos into exile 
troops went on alert in the manila area tuesday to prevent 
possible reprisals after the arrest according to presidential

coup attempt by his followers 
a spokesman for soldiers involved in the december coup said the 
nation should brace itself for the imminent declaration of

chancellor helmut kohl favors the two 
german parliaments making formal statements that recognize polands 
western border a government spokesman said on wednesday 
speaking in an east german television interview wednesday night 
kohl seemed annoyed over worries even among his allies about his 
stance on the border issue 
in many speeches i have said that no one wants to connect the 
unity of the germans with moving the borders i dont know what 
more i can say kohl said on east germanys aktuella kamera 
news program 
kohl has come under sharp criticism abroad and at home for what 
is seen as an unclear position on lands east of the oder and neisse 
rivers once held by germany and now part of poland 
the land about onethird of presentday poland was given to 
that country after the defeat in 1945 of adolf hitlers third reich 
kohl has never formally stated that a united germany would not 
lay claim to that land and this is viewed as a major difficulty in 
the unification process 
poland the united states and britain among others have 
expressed concern over what they consider kohls lack of action 
kohl apparently seeking to soothe his critics told his cabinet 
wednesday he understands the polish wish for a legally binding 
recognition of polands western borders said government 
spokesman dieter vogel 
the chancellor also said he sees the possibility that after east 
germanys elections on march 18 the parliaments of both german 
nations could issue declarations on the matter said vogel 
vogel said such a declaration could confirm a resolution already 
passed by the west german parliament on nov 8 stating that germans 
neither now nor in the future will attempt to change the border 
nonetheless in the wednesday night interview kohl reiterated 
his view that only a united german government could have final say 
about a possible treaty giving a united germanys formal 
recognition of the current border 
kohl said only the highest sovereign german power in the case 
of reunification could conclude such a treaty 
he also dismissed any fears of the rise of a fourth reich as 
rubbish the germans are completely immersed in international 
responsibility kohl said 
kohl under pressure from archconservative voters has sought to 
allay polish worries but at the same time has insisted only a 
united germany could take an official stand on the border issue 
the opposition social democrats have charged that with such 
pronouncements kohl is endangering international support for 
german unification 
hansjochen vogel head of the social democrats said wednesday 
kohls statements about the border issue have been irresponsible 
and detrimental to german interests 
kohl also has come under sharp criticism from the junior 
partners in his coalition government the liberal free democrats of 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
genscher himself has said the matter should be cleared up and 
has expressed interest in a polish proposal that poland and the two 
german nations work up a border treaty to be signed and ratified 
after formal german unification 
juergen chrobog genschers spokesman said the foreign minister 
referred to the importance of this proposal during wednesdays 
cabinet session 
but west germanys 2 millionstrong association of exiles said 
it would take legal action if a united germany formally recognized 
polands western border

federal financing for aids prevention is unlikely 
to continue to grow as fast in the 1990s as it did during the 
epidemics first decade the centers for disease control warns in a 
draft of a new report 
program needs can be expected to continue to grow at a pace 
that will probably exceed available resources the atlantabased 
agency said in the draft of its strategic plan for prevention of 
hiv infection 1990 and beyond 
we must approach our planning with an awareness of these 
changes and a willingness to change it said 
the agencys congressional appropriation for aids programs in 
the current fiscal year is 443 million up 17 percent from 19889 
president bushs request for the next fiscal year is 509 million 
an increase of less than 15 percent 
the rapid increase in funding in the mid80s is leveling 
off said dr gary noble deputy director for aids programs 
theres a growing recognition that aids has to compete with all 
the other health problems and all the other national priorities 
the funding cant continue to increase at the rate that it 
did without curtailing other high priority programs 
the 50page report which is being circulated to public health 
professionals aids experts and educators outlines the agencys 
goals and objectives for aids based on 16 planning assumptions 
among those assumptions 
the aids epidemic is actually composed of multiple 
subepidemics chiefly among homosexual men selected racial 
and ethnic minority populations and intravenous drug abusers 
our efforts to intervene must be tailored to the specific 
needs of those subpopulations noble said 
the rate of change in the epidemic is not the same for each of 
those subepidemics he added noting a slowing of aids in some 
gay white male bigcity populations while aids continues to soar 
among intravenous drug abusers 
human immunodeficiency virus the aids virus causes a 
lifelong persistent infection usually leading to progressive 
illness and death although 10 years or more can pass between 
initial infection and illness 
behaviors are major determinants of hiv infection 
including gay male sex multiple sex partners and having sex or 
sharing drug needles with infected people 
the report says that to prevent sexaul transmission of aids the 
cdc needs to support and promote counseling testing referral and 
notification of sexual partners 
opportunities for medical interventions to prolong the life of 
aidsinfected people will be lost unless major barriers to testing 
programs such as fear of public exposure and discrimination are 
removed it says 
but some aids activists have said testing and counseling arent 
nearly enough 
once we test all these people what are we going to do with 
them mike merdian executive director of the national 
association of people with aids said in comments published in 
wednesdays atlanta constitution you cant talk about testing 
without talking about treatment 
merdian did not return calls for further comment wednesday 
the draft report said the cdc should develop and evaluate better 
tests for aidsrelated viruses to better prevent transmission 
through the blood supply the agency noted that the risk of aids 
transmission through blood transfusion is small but still exists 
with current testing procedures 
recommendations in the plan are not specific suggestions to each 
and every state and local health agency but rather are a plan 
communicating generally to the public noble said 
after public comment and possible revisions the cdc report is 
scheduled for release in june 
the cdc estimates that 1 million americans are infected with 
hiv while another 5200057000 aids cases will be diagnosed this 
year more than 117000 aids cases have been reported since 1981

the head of a major abortion clinic on wednesday 
hailed the governments decision to subsidize abortions performed 
with the controversial ru 486 pill and said it would not increase 
the number of pregnancies terminated in france 
the government announced this week that the cost of the 
procedure would be reimbursed under the national health care 
program which covers most medical and dental care costs in france 
were very pleased with the decision which weve been 
expecting for some time said dr elisabeth aubeny chief of the 
abortion clinic at the broussais hospital in paris 
but it wont increase the number of abortions performed in 
france because the decision to terminate a pregnancy is not a 
question of money its because the patient has no other choice 
she said in a telephone interview 
under a decree signed monday by health minister claude evin 
women undergoing druginduced abortions will be reimbursed 80 
percent of the actual cost of 246 
the pill procedure costs only slightly more than other types of 
abortion which have been legal in france since 1975 and have been 
partially covered by the national health care program since 1983 
the ru 486 pill or mifepristone invented by french researcher 
etienneemile beaulieu for the rousseluclaf pharmaceutical 
company was first authorized for use in september 1988 
however roussel pressured by antiabortion activists in europe 
and the united states withdrew it from the market the government 
then ordered the company to resume distribution 
the pill known under the brand name mifegyne has been 
distributed widely in france free of charge but the company said 
wednesday it will now be marketed commercially it is not for sale 
elsewhere 
dr aubeny predicted more women would turn to the ru 486 a 
safer and simpler alternative to traditional methods of abortion 
there are both physical and psychological advantages to using 
the abortion pill it avoids the many complications that go with 
surgery and anesthesia and makes patients feel more involved in the 
procedure she said 
the pill a synthetic hormone compound works by blocking the 
action of progesterone a hormone essential in all stages of 
pregnancy researchers say ru 486 is especially effective in the 
early stages of pregnancy 
there are 793 centers throughout france that distribute the 
pill about 20000 women have had druginduced abortions 
the ru 486 is not a doityourself morningafter pill that can 
be purchased over the counter and taken at home it is dispensed 
only in governmentapproved hospitals and clinics where patients 
are screened for potential physical and psychological problems 
three appointments are needed spread over a sevenday period as 
required by french law first patients take three tablets of 
mifepristone simultaneously two days later they receive an 
injection of the hormone prostaglandin which produces contractions 
to dislodge the fertilized egg 
dr aubeny said the egg is usually expelled within 12 hours at 
broussais hospital patients receive their injections in the 
morning and spend the rest of the day under observation 
the procedure is followed by a checkup including an ultrasound 
test to make sure the pregnancy has been terminated 
there were 162960 abortions performed in france in 1988 
figures for 1989 have not been released

disposable packaging accounts for about 
onethird of the more than 60 billion pounds of plastics produced 
annually and very little is recycled the environmental protection 
agency said wednesday 
the epa in a report to congress noted that the plastics industry 
in recent years has stepped up its recycling efforts but the 
agency said less than 1 percent of all plastic is recycled 
we expect that amount to increase because of recent efforts 
by the plastics industry to push recycling said robin woods a 
spokeswoman for the epa 
the epa said that plastics account for about 7 percent of 
municipal solid waste by weight and depending on various studies 
between 14 percent and 21 percent of waste by volume 
the plastic waste stream has quadrupled since 1970 it will 
increase by 50 percent by the year 2000 said the epa

the senate abruptly halted debate on 125 
million in aid for volunteer groups tuesday after squabbling broke 
out over whether homosexuals should be allowed to serve as coaches 
teachers and in similar jobs 
the district of columbia is trying to force big brothers and 
other service organizations to accept homosexual persons into their 
organizations as counselors and role models and i think thats 
intolerable said sen william armstrong rcolo 
the senate had been expected to finish work tuesday night on a 
125 million authorization bill for programs to reward volunteers 
to aiding senior citizens the homeless and others in need 
but lawmakers halted work for the night after getting bogged 
down over an armstrong plan to nullify a district government policy 
that requires service groups to consider homosexual applicants for 
membership 
armstrong would change local law to say that none of its 
provisions would bar any organization or entity from denying 
restricting abridging or conditioning the participation of 
homosexuals from any activity that educates coaches or trains 
any minor or holds out the adult as a role model mentor or 
companion to any minor 
sen edward m kennedy dmass called on the senate to table 
or kill armstrongs proposal saying that no one had asked for it 
and that lawmakers should not impose something on the nations 
capital that would not apply to the rest of the country 
whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander kennedy 
said 
but kennedy manager of the volunteer bill did not press for a 
vote on his move instead he said that enough work remained on the 
legislation that the senate should cease work for the night and 
start fresh in the morning 
armstrongs measure brought a sharp rebuke from the human rights 
campaign fund a gay and lesbian political group 
we consider it a legislative hate crime against lesbians and 
gays said fund spokesman gregory king the organization was a 
strong supporter of legislation recently passed by the senate that 
calls on the justice department to compile statistics on hate 
crimes aimed at minority groups

three people 
the hand of the government is behind reports that my 
colleagues planned to take over the terminals and that they 
provoked a confrontation he said 
attorney general rafael robles catalan of guerrero state said he 
ordered police to disperse party members because the governor 
doesnt want vandalism and is trying to protect the community

a senior government officials prediction that 
230000 soviet jews could immigrate to israel this year heightened 
fears wednesday that israel was unprepared to handle the influx 
panic a quartermillion new immigrants on their way read a 
banner headline in the hebrew daily hadashot 
the daily maariv and staterun israel radio noted the new figure 
heightened confusion over immigration estimates since most 
officials are predicting that about 100000 soviet jews will arrive 
this year 
even that number could be a problem israel has geared up to 
receive only about 50000 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile sharply criticized 
arab states that object to the immigration of soviet jews here and 
called them the enemy of israel 
shamir told us jewish leaders that the arab campaign to halt 
immigration to israel was hysterical 
we say to all arab countries including egypt that anyone 
who fights against this immigration reveals himself as an enemy of 
israel he told members of the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations 
arab states fear that the soviet jews will be settled in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip where the palestine liberation 
organization has declared its independent state 
israeli officials have repeatedly denied there is a government 
policy of settling soviet jews in the occupied lands available 
figures indicate that only about 200 of 12000 soviet jews who 
arrived last year decided on settling in the territories 
about 100 are believed to have settled in the territories in the 
last few months 
if anyone expects me to say that we shall forbid any jew from 
going to judea samaria or elsewhere i shall never do that 
shamir told the american jewish leaders using the biblical names 
for the west bank 
the higher prediction of soviet jewish immigration came from 
yasha kazakov deputy head of the liaison bureau a oncesecret 
government department that deals with soviet jewry israeli media 
said 
kazakov gave the figure tuesday to a group of directors of 
government ministries that handle immigration matters hadashot 
reported 
when he pulled out the numbers we were in a state of shock 
ephraim cohen deputy director of the absorption ministry told 
maariv there was silence in the hall 
kazakov said he thought 50000 soviet jews would arrive by june 
an additional 120000 in the summer and 60000 more in the last 
four months maariv said 
his projections were based on the possibility of increased 
emigration via the existing routes through romania and hungary and 
new exit routes through czechoslovakia finland and poland maariv 
said 
soviet authorities have so far refused israeli requests to allow 
emigrants to fly directly from the soviet union to israel arab 
nations have urged the kremlin to restrict jewish emigration 
so far this year 9441 soviet jews have arrived joining more 
than 12000 who immigrated to israel in 1989 
the upsurge in soviet jewish arrivals comes as a result of more 
liberal soviet emigration policies fears of rising antisemitism 
in the soviet union and us visa restrictions 
gennady zhuravlev the soviet amabassador to egypt charged 
monday that israel was deliberately overestimating the number of 
soviet jews it expects in order to obtain more aid from the united 
states and other western nations 
absorption minister yitzhak peretz speaking wednesday on israel 
army radio in a telephone interview from new york said he was 
visiting the united states to try to get more help from american 
jews for the immigrants 
without a massive help from the jewish people we will not be 
able to fulfill this historic mission peretz said 
peretz said it was hard to predict immigration accurately 
undoubtedly at least 120000 to 150000 will come with gods 
help but there may be surprises and many more may come he said 
peretz did not say whether his figures referred only to soviet 
jews or included immigrants from other countries as well 
meanwhile uri gordon head of the immigration department at the 
jewish agency a quasigovernmental body that deals with 
immigrants demanded that israel declare a state of emergency to 
deal with the soviet immigrants 
it does not matter whether we expect 100000 or 200000 
gordon said masses of jews could come this obliges us to 
declare an emergency situation and set different priorities 
he mentioned the possibility of converting youth hostels to 
housing for the newcomers

the swedish navy fired underwater 
grenades wednesday at a suspected alien submarine the target of a 
weeklong search in a sensitive coastal zone south of stockholm the 
defense command said 
spokesman hg wessberg said antisubmarine sonar may have 
picked up an echo from a rock on the seabed instead of an 
intruding vessel but the search for an intruder was continuing 
the grenades were launched about 21 miles from stockholm no 
trace of a damaged sub was found said a communique 
theres a lot to indicate that it was a protrusion on the 
bottom of the sea said wessberg sonar is easily distorted in 
the shallow and brackish sea defense experts say 
coastal units first detected indications last thursday that 
swedish waters may have been violated 
it was the third time since the weekend that the swedes fired at 
what they believed to be a foreign sub or group of minisubs 
rand corp a us research institute said two weeks ago that 
soviet subs stepped up illegal incursions in swedish waters after 
mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
swedish researcher wilhelm agrell said in january that the 
soviet military intelligence agency gru was carrying out the 
intrusions using minisubmarines launched from a mobile trailer 
system in the baltic republics 
the swedish military upgraded its antisubmarine capability after 
a soviet submarined was grounded outside karlskrona naval base in 
1981

the failure of sen david durenberger 
rminn to disclose an unsecured 485000 loan resulted from a 
misunderstanding of senate rules aides said thursday 
three other loans that the minnesota republican took out from 
commercial state bank of st paul minn were not listed 
separately on his financial disclosure form according to his 
staff that also may be a violation of senate rules 
it was the first attempt by durenbergers office to explain 
apparent errors in reporting favorable borrowings from the 
minnesota bank the reporting discrepancies were made public three 
weeks ago in a newspaper article that disclosed the favorable terms 
durenberger received on a series of loans from the bank 
durenberger already is under investigation by the senate ethics 
committee for failing to disclose on time reimbursement he received 
from lobbyists for numerous speaking engagements in 1985 and 1986 
theres absolutely no intention to leave information out 
said durenberger spokeswoman carrie collins theres no intention 
to hide anything 
although the senate ethics committee has not looked into the 
loans the committee last week found substantial credible 
evidence of six violations of federal law and senate rules in the 
senators financial conduct 
triallike hearings on those allegations which focus on a book 
contract he used to raise 100000 in speaking fees could begin 
later this month 
the borrowings that durenberger apparently did not disclose 
properly were among 20 unsecured loans totaling 127 million he 
obtained from the commercial state bank of st paul from 1979 to 
1988 
durenbergers 1988 financial disclosure report listed three 
loans from commercial state bank but missing from the form was the 
shortterm 484332 loan the senator got in june 1988 to obtain 
financing on a mclean va townhouse 
the attorney who prepared the report thought the swing loan 
did not have to be reported because senators are not required to 
disclose loans on their personal residences that are secured by the 
property according to a statement issued by bert mckasy the 
senators chief of staff 
the senators 1983 report listed only one liability with 
commercial state bank although he borrowed from the bank three 
times at varying interest rates less than the rate he reported 
an 85000 loan taken out in 1982 at 13 percent interest was 
renewed and increased to 90000 in january 1983 according to the 
statement a 15000 loan was taken out at 115 percent in april of 
that year a third loan of 10000 was obtained in december at 12 
percent interest 
the financial disclosure report listed only a personal 
promissory note in the category of value of 100001 to 250000 
at an interest rate of 13 percent 
it was the understanding of the preparer that the forms could 
be filled out in that way collins said the intent was to 
represent the total amount of liability that was due commercial 
state bank within that time frame 1983 and that was done 
however instructions provided with the financial disclosure 
forms specify that senators must disclose the amount maturity 
date repayment terms and interest rate for each liability 
exceeding 10000 
the instructions would require that you report each loan 
individually said wilson abney the ethics committees chief of 
staff

a 5yearold boy who the authorities 
said was given 10 ounces of bourbon by an adult and told to drink 
it like a man died wednesday almost 11 hours after being removed 
from lifesupport systems 
doctors said raymond thomas griffin ii fell into a coma and 
suffered irreversible brain damage after a 21yearold party guest 
at his home allegedly told him to drink the alcohol friday night 
police said 
he died at cookfort worth childrens medical center at 845 
am wednesday the hospital said griffins family agreed to 
disconnect the life support system that had kept him alive at about 
10 pm tuesday but the child had continued to breathe on his own 
anthony jimerson 21 of forest hills was being held in the 
tarrant county jail in lieu of 100000 bail after being charged 
with injury to a child officials said the charge carries a 
maximum 99year prison term 
police and prosecutors were discussing upgrading the charges 
against jimerson who told the boy to drink the alcohol said 
everman police detective jd brown he said he did not anticipate 
new charges immediately 
it was unclear whether the boys mother patricia griffin 31 
knew that the boy was being given liquor or whether she found out 
later when raymond became ill 
were getting some conflicting stories on whether she knew 
whether she was told that night or in the morning brown said 
brown said it appeared that the boy began having convulsions at 
about 3 am saturday but an ambulance was not called until 245 
pm 
brown said ms griffin probably would be interviewed after the 
boys funeral 
the amount the boy drank was the equivalent of an adult 
chugaluging a fifth of liquor officials said doctors said the 
boys blood alcohol level was 55 percent more than five times the 
legal limit of intoxication in texas 
brown said doctors indicated they might have been able to help 
the boy if he had been brought in sooner 
thats a question ive placed and directed straight to the 
doctor and the neurologist that treated raymond he said if it 
had been recognized immediately it is a very very good 
possibility that they could have helped or saved him or maybe even 
stopped the damage 
brown said he had seen the boy before at the suburban apartment 
complex where raymond lived with his mother and 2yearold brother 
he was just a bright inquisitive child very polite he 
said 
he was intelligent for a 5yearold the father raymond 
griffin of myrtle beach sc told the fort worth startelegram 
i used to read to him a lot and i didnt read him comic books i 
read him time books about leadership books about my work in the 
army 
he was going to be brilliant

senate leaders and the bush administration 
reached an accord wednesday on pollution controls for automobiles 
removing a major obstacle to agreement on a compromise clean air 
bill senate sources said 
closeddoor negotiations continued into the evening over details 
about new acid rain controls but sources close to the talks said 
those issues were unlikely to scuttle the rest of the pollution 
control package which has been worked out in three weeks of 
bargaining 
disagreements over acid rain might be set aside and be thrashed 
out on the senate floor if the differences involving largely 
disagreements among senators are not resolved said an aide to one 
senator who has been close to the private talks 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he planned 
to bring the clean air bill to the senate floor on thursday and had 
no desire to extend the private bargaining with the administration 
for another day 
the talks which had gone past midnight twice this week 
continued into the evening as negotiators focused on remaining 
disagreements over provisions on controlling acid rain it was the 
only remaining area of disagreement the sources said 
while senate leaders and the bush administration have agreed on 
most of the acid rain provision individual senators have not 
a group of midwest senators have threatened to filibuster 
against the clean air bill if they do not receive help in paying 
for the expensive pollution controls that would be required at many 
of that regions coalfired electric plants have to meet the deep 
cuts required for acid rain pollution 
other senators have balked at such cotsharing because they 
argued their states already have paid to clean up their electric 
plants these same senators however have expressed concern that 
the new pollution controls might inhibit growth of electric 
capacity in their states 
the negotiations turned to the acid rain issue after the two 
sides agreed on how to curb emissions from automobiles and reduce 
the smog problem that has plagued many urban areas 
the issue had been among the most contentious under discussion 
the senate bill called for two rounds of tough emission controls on 
automobiles to reduce urban smog 
the bush administration however had strongly objected to the 
second round of controls saying they were too expensive and 
provided only marginal benefits senate authors of the legislation 
however argued the additional controls were needed for some of the 
most polluted urban centers to achieve clean air 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
compromise agreement calls for the socalled tier 2 controls to go 
into effect nationwide only if 11 of 27 cities now considered to 
have serious air pollution problems fail to make adequate 
progress in meeting federal air quality standards by late in this 
decade 
environmentalists criticized the compromise as being almost as 
bad as not have a second round of emission controls at all they 
argued that it is unlikely that 11 the 27 cities would not be able 
to achieve the federal standards since the group of 27 does not 
include the eight of the countrys most polluted cities which are 
in categories of severe or extreme pollution 
you could have cities with a total of 80 million people not in 
federal air quality attainment and still not have a tier 2 
said gene karpinski executive director of the us public interest 
research group an environmental group 
the senateadminstration talks earlier this week produced 
tentative agreements on how to control toxic chemicals from 
industrial plants and on curbing smogcausing pollutants from an 
array of stationery sources from chemical plants to dry cleaners 
while most of the focus has been on the senate bill in recent 
weeks a different version remains in a house committee house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said wednesday he hoped that bill 
could come up for floor consideration by april several months 
earlier than he previously had indicated

more than 6600 hospital patients died and 
thousands more were injured through medical negligence in new york 
state in 1984 but few malpractice suits were filed said a harvard 
university study released wednesday 
although the survey involved only new york state researchers 
said they expect a nationwide survey would find similar results 
dr david axelrod the state health commissioner said the 
results pointed to major inequities in the medical malpractice 
system involving both compensating victims and deterring 
professional misconduct 
axelrod who backs a proposal for nofault malpractice 
insurance said he believed such a reform would improve the system 
because doctors would be less fearful that reporting negligence by 
colleagues would bring lawsuits upon themselves or their hospital 
but consumer rights groups and advocates for victims of medical 
negligence who oppose the nofault plan called for more 
government policing of doctors and stiffer penalties for those 
found guilty of negligence 
despite the thousands of instances of malpractice documented in 
the study only 26 doctors were disciplined in the state in 1984 
for negligence 
how can this be no ones fault asked elaine orourke 
pointing to her son who went into a brooklyn hospital for a 
bedwetting problem and came out brain damaged and confined to a 
wheelchair 
orourke and other members of her group stop hospital and 
medical errors frequently interrupted a news conference on the 
study with demands that criminal penalties be adopted for 
healthcare workers found guilty of negligent acts 
overall the study estimated that 37 percent of those 
hospitalized sustained an injury in the hospital that resulted in 
measurable disability 
the researchers said that would translate into 99000 injuries 
out of 27 million people hospitalized statewide in 1984 
most of the injuries were relatively minor 70 percent of 
patients recovered completely within six months but 14 percent 
were fatal a rate which translated into more than 13000 deaths in 
1984 
fiftyone percent of the fatal injuries resulted from 
negligence the study found but it noted that many of the deaths 
occurred in patients who had greatly shortened life expectancies 
from their underlying diseases 
doctors and hospitals are required by state law to report all 
cases of possible medical misconduct however peter slocum a 
health department spokesman said the state received only 1525 
reports of possible misconduct in 1984 and only 161 came from 
physicians or hospitals 
axelrod denied that there was a code of silence among health 
care providers over reporting negligence cases he blamed the 
current tort system which he said deters compliance with the 
law 
a large number of adverse events that occur in institutions 
are not currently being reported to us he said 
the number of malpractice claims filed against doctors and 
hospitals was only about 10 percent of the total number of 
negligent injuries the study found of the patients who were found 
in the study to have been injured because of negligence only 2 
percent filed malpractice claims 
the medical society of the state of new york which supports 
axelrods calls for malpractice reform applauded the report and 
said the current tort system was a grotesque failure 
it overcompensates some but tragically it fails to compensate 
many many people who are the victims of inadequate medical care 
spokesman gerard l conway told the news conference 
the new york state trial lawyers association issued a statement 
saying the states malpractice crisis was not the fault of the 
legal system but rather is caused by negligent and substandard 
care by doctors 
the fouryear 31million study one of the most comprehensive 
ever undertaken involved a review of the records of more than 
30000 patients from 51 randomly selected hospitals in new york 
state 
the researchers stressed that the findings could not be applied 
to hospitals today since most hospitals have taken a variety of 
steps since 1984 to improve patient care 
the study looked at cases of unintended injury which was 
defined as one caused by medical management rather than by the 
disease process they included errors in performing medical 
procedures as well as diagnostic errors and improper or omitted 
care

a federal jury awarded a woman 11 
million after deciding that four sheriffs officers including her 
estranged husbands father and uncle violated her civil rights 
when they intervened in a domestic dispute 
lori bowden of palatka said that in 1987 the four st johns 
county officers used their positions to find and detain her so her 
husband tommy wayne bowden jr could take their infant son from 
her 
jurors deliberated for about 70 minutes tuesday before ruling 
against the defendants lt byron kirkland deputy melvin tennyson 
and auxiliary officers tommy wayne bowden sr and fleming bowden 
the bowdens are tommy bowdens father and uncle 
gayle smith swedmark who represented the defendants said she 
will appeal on the basis that it was an outrageous award 
william l townsend mrs bowdens attorney said he was 
satisfied with the jurys award i thought something very 
outrageous had been done to her he said 
mrs bowden testified that she and her husband separated in may 
1987 but he returned on oct 5 saying he wanted to rekindle their 
marriage 
she testified that when she tried to flee he shot the truck she 
was driving disabling it she returned home with him but fled the 
next day with her 2yearold son tommy wayne bowden iii and filed 
aggravated assault charges against her husband 
on oct 9 tennyson and the auxiliary deputies tracked her to a 
friends apartment in st augustine they told her they wanted to 
check on the boys condition and refused to let her leave until her 
husband also saw him when he arrived at the apartment he took the 
boy she said 
she then returned home to be with her son five days later 
bowden was arrested for aggravated assault 
townsend argued that kirkland the watch commander that night 
approved the officers action despite a policy forbidding uniformed 
officers from interfering in incidents involving relatives of 
officers 
ms swedmark said the men were merely checking on the babys 
welfare and that it was unclear whether bowden took the child or 
mrs bowden voluntarily gave him the boy 
the bowdens are now divorced and mrs bowden has custody of 
their son

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee accused president bush on wednesday of failing to exclude 
military personnel from required budget cuts and then calling on 
congress to avert the expected layoffs 
the administration is the one who clearly laid the bed of 
thorns and is now pointing the finger at congress saying help us 
to get out of this situation sen sam nunn dga told 
reporters shortly after a hearing at which members of the joint 
chiefs of staff painted a dire picture of the effect of the budget 
reductions 
the armed services chairman also lashed out at the chief of 
naval operations adm carlisle ah trost for an absence of major 
restructuring in the navy force in response to the lessening soviet 
threat to the west 
i want them to think think said nunn who questioned 
why one of the armed services could say that it had felt no effects 
from the dramatic changes in eastern europe 
nunn and sen john warner of virginia the panels ranking 
republican said they favor granting the defense department the 
authority to move 852 million from other accounts to personnel to 
avoid the discharge of tens of thousands of men and women by 
october 
the cuts are required under the grammrudman deficitcutting law 
but rep les aspin dwis the chairman of the house armed 
services committee told the service chiefs monday that his 
committee will not take up the issue of shifting the funds thus 
dooming the pentagons request 
such reprogramming of funds must be approved by the house 
and senate armed services committees and the house and senate 
appropriations commitees 
nunn questioned the service chiefs as to why bush did not exempt 
military personnel from the cuts an option that the president 
could have exercised last august under the law 
the defense department evidently did not come down strong on 
exempting personnel if they did they failed within the 
administration nunn said during the committee hearing now 
everybody in the administration is pointing at congress saying 
save us from what weve done and its your fault if you dont 
save us from what we didnt do 
thats a curious position to be in 
trost said all the service chiefs argued for exempting military 
personnel but were assured by administration officials that any 
cuts from grammrudman would be softened by a request to shift 
funds 
we four all supported the need to protect our people last 
fall trost said 
nunn said the administration shouldnt have given those 
assurances based on the belief that officials could later convince 
four congressional committees to accept the transfer of funds 
somebody should have checked with the four committees because 
obviously the house wasnt plugged into that nunn said 
he said he hoped the fund transfer could occur but aspin in an 
interview later in the day said the chances of his changing his 
mind are zero 
youll see a lot of wheeling and dealing but its not going 
to work the house armed services chairman said in an interview 
with several reporters 
the pentagon on tuesday released estimates showing that without 
the authority to transfer funds 44100 to 68200 military 
personnel would have to be discharged by oct 1 32500 to 32600 
people would be frozen in their current jobs 57000 to 67000 
promotions would be delayed and 59900 to 115900 fewer people 
could be brought into the armed forces 
questioned whether his action was irresponsible aspin said 
i want to do the responsible thing in the long run make them 
the administration understand the consequences in the short run

eighteen ships were stuck wednesday 
in the gulf of st lawrence in what the canadian coast said were 
the worst ice conditions on the waterway in 10 years 
andy maillet assistant coast guard ice operations officer said 
the combination of an early winter extremely low temperatures and 
easterly winds had created a near impenetrable layer of ice 
some of these ships have been out there quite a long time 
maillet said some of them have been stuck for four or five 
days 
the ice driven by easterly winds runs in a line from the 
strait of belle isle to the gaspe peninsula and anticosti island 
it has been drifting generally in a southwest direction 
enabling it to press up against the newfoundland and cape breton 
coasts maillet said 
the ice has disrupted shipping for the past two weeks and left 
coast guard officials hoping for an early spring 
six icebreakers four from nova scotia and one each from 
newfoundland and quebec were trying to break the ships free and 
escort them to passable ice 
at one point last week 26 ships were stuck the numbers keep 
changing as some vessels break free 
once the ice pressure changes a little bit they are able to 
back away from the particular ice pan theyre in and then carry on 
their voyage said maillet but you lose one you gain another 
 
he said he expected poor shipping conditions would continue for 
a couple more weeks 
maillet said none of the 18 ships including tankers 
freighters and container vessels was in immediate danger 
although some were low on water and fuel 
none of them has run out of fuel yet we wont let them 
maillet said 
he warned the situation could change quickly however 
depending on where they get stuck they could fall into danger 
of drifting ashore he said 
eight of the icebound ships were trying to reach gulf ports 
while the other 10 were trying to get through the cabot strait to 
the open atlantic 
the coast guard had to take medication by helicopter to one ship 
last week while a search and rescue crew carried out a medical 
evacuation of a crewmember with a badly cut finger

a swedish embassy security guard was found 
beaten and shot to death wednesday in an embassy bathroom in what 
appeared to be a politically motivated attack officials said 
defense minister gen alejandro gramajo linked the killing of 
agustin alvarado hernandez to extremist violence in guatemala and 
to un discussions in geneva of human rights in this central 
american country 
he said swedish news media reported recently that sweden had 
asked the united nations to name a human rights liaison for 
guatemala 
we believe that this act of violence has to do with a policy 
in which the extremes are favored whether of the leftist remnant 
of marxistleninism that remains in the caribbean and particularly 
in guatemala or of the super right that i have always called 
terrorist also gramajo said 
authorities said hernandez worked for a private security company 
contracted by the embassy they did not say when he was killed 
swedish ambassador ulf lewin received bomb threats on jan 23 
according to news reports at the time and authorities offered to 
increase security for the embassy 
some human rights organizations estimate more than 100000 
people have been killed in political violence in guatemala since 
1954 rightwing death squads which once claimed responsibility 
for many assassinations resurfaced in 1989 with an increase in 
killings kidnappings and disappearances the squads have claimed 
responsibility for only a few of the cases 
students professionals peasant leaders and others who work 
with peasants have been traditional targets of the violence 
particularly during army campaigns against leftist guerrillas who 
have been fighting 28 years to overthrow the succession of military 
and militarydominated guatemalan governments

some group leaders who came to announce a concession to the 
protesters students and witnesses said 
on tuesday night soldiers marched onto the campus of the 
national university of ivory coast beat students with truncheons 
and arrested about 30 who are being held at a military camp in the 
capital students said 
the students began protesting feb 19 they have demanded 
improved living conditions and better facilities but also have 
politial demands freedom of expression and a multiparty state in 
this west african nation 
the militants also want officials to authorize a new group to 
replace the movement of pupils and students the youth league of 
the countrys sole legal political party 
late tuesday leaders of the partycontrolled union went to the 
main university campus and residences scattered around the capital 
to tell students the government had agreed to halve their costs of 
boarding and lodging state radio broadcast the news wednesday 
but the students at dormitories in yopougon a working class 
suburb said they attacked the student leaders and when they fled 
set their car ablaze 
foreign journalists who watched the scene said the car had 
government license tags a target of students who have burned and 
stoned several cars and stateowned buses in the past 10 days 
the students have been particularly enraged by the sleek 
mercedes benz cars that the government provides for cabinet 
ministers despite a 10year recession that has brought salary cuts 
unemployment and lowered living standards 
the state student movement leader keita aboubacar was beaten 
by about 50 students at the main suburban campus when he carried 
news of the government price cuts students involved in the attack 
said wednesday 
they said the student leader had to be treated at the hospital 
tuesday night but he later denied to reporters there was any 
attack on himself or members of his movement he said two foreign 
reporters who reported seeing a burning car belonging to a movement 
official had lied 
however a militant protester said this is our response to 
their efforts to pacify us were going to carry on demonstrating 
the government said wednesday it was transferring the 
responsibilities for secondary and higher education from bella 
keita to alhassane ndiaye the minister of culture and scientific 
research 
militant students have demanded keitas removal communications 
minister auguste miremont told reporters no reason was given for 
the cabinet reshuffle 
students said they also were angered by government proposals 
this week to introduce more of the austerity measures that have 
brought hardship to this onceprosperous nation the ivory coast is 
suffering from slumping prices of cocoa and coffee its main 
exports 
president felix houphouetboigny told a meeting of worker and 
employer organizations monday that he proposes to cut the salaries 
of government employees including cabinet ministers by 15 percent 
to 40 percent and tax all wage earners an additional 10 percent 
he also proposed a 20 percent reduction in electricity charges 
and up to 15 percent cuts in water bills 
the president whose civilian government has ruled since the 
nation became independent from france in 1960 has met unexpected 
opposition from the staterun general union of workers a usually 
docile body 
union leader adiko gniamke said at mondays meeting that workers 
could not support further salary cuts 
instead he demanded the return of millions of dollars he said 
had been deposited abroad by highranking dignitaries 
the same demand has been made by the student protesters and the 
union of university lecturers the only body that has publicly 
expressed support for the rebellious students

firefighters on wednesday finally 
extinguished a blaze at a dump where 14 million old tires had 
burned for 17 days forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 
smoky fumes the fire chief announced 
its out man its history said buck slote chief of the 
volunteer hagersville fire department 
were going to spend about a week out there cleaning up and 
then were going to have one hell of a party right here in the fire 
hall 
the fire believed set by an arsonist began on feb 12 at the 
tyre king recycling dump forcing people to leave their homes in 
the area 22 miles southwest of hamilton and about 150 miles east of 
detroit most have since returned home 
slote 51 fought the blaze alongside his son cary and other 
members of the 30man volunteer force plus firefighters from 24 
other departments 
he said he rushed to the 11acre dump in the twilight after 
hearing a radio report the fire was out 
what did he see 
i saw nothing it was beautiful 
in frigid temperatures pelted by snow and ice storms the 
firefighters had fought the blaze into a third week before claiming 
victory 
they used breathing apparatus to stand up to choking smoke 
broke a huge mountain of tires into smaller piles and bombed the 
flames from the air with water mixed with a chemical fire 
retardant most days the water bombers were grounded by bad 
weather and the firefighters on the ground had to go it alone 
the tire dump ontarios largest was declared an illegal waste 
site in december 1985 
groundwater and soil contamination were major concerns but 
spokesman gerry merchant of the ontario environment ministry said 
107 of 125 tested wells in the area showed no contamination 
he also said an airquality monitoring system near the dump had 
registered only slight chemical contamination 
however officials still cautioned farmers to keep livestock 
away from drinking water in a nearby creek 
douglas kittle regional health officer said initial test 
results were reassuring 
but residents were still worried about longterm environmental 
damage 
how can all that stuff go into the ground and not cause 
problems asked don davidson a 32yearold farmer

the father of a 7yearold girl 
he has not seen in more than two years arrived here thursday to 
renew a court battle for custody of the child whose mother went to 
jail for hiding her 
dr erich foretich flew into christchurch from auckland and said 
he will abide by the new zealand family court ruling not to see his 
daughter hilary 
hilarys mother dr elizabeth morgan has accused her former 
husband of sexually abusing the child a charge foretich has denied 
foretich a dentist from falls church va would not respond to 
the allegations thursday but said he would strive to keep hilarys 
privacy and dignity 
im not going to get involved in scintillation and 
retaliation he told reporters at christchurch airport before 
being whisked into a waiting car and driven through the city with 
media vehicles in pursuit 
hilary reportedly has not seen either parent for two years 
no date has been set for the custody hearing and morgan still 
is awaiting a superior court ruling in washington dc to regain 
her passport confiscated when she went to jail in august 1987 for 
refusing to disclose hilarys whereabouts 
morgan sent the child off with her parents after a washington 
judge ruled that foretich could have unsupervised visits with 
hilary 
morgan spent 25 months in jail and was released only after 
congress passed a law tailored for her that limited imprisonment 
for civil contempt to one year 
foretich aided by private investigators tracked his daughter 
to christchuch a south island city of 300000 people 190 miles 
south of wellington 
foreign journalists have descended on the city since he arrived 
in australia on monday and hilarys grandmother antonia morgan 
said the child was feeling haunted by the battery of 
photographers and journalists 
the family court which is to rule on the case has warned 
journalists they could be fined or jailed if they publish details 
of the custody saga 
new zealands contempt of court laws are much tougher than us 
laws and bar any discussion of a case before its conclusion

a banker who was indicted on racketeering 
charges with imelda marcos the widow of deposed philippine leader 
ferdinand marcos pleaded guilty wednesday to a lesser charge and 
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
the plea by rodolfo t arambulo came just hours after the judge 
declined to dismiss the indictment against mrs marcos on a claim 
she and her husband were abducted from their homeland by us 
officials during his overthrow in february 1986 
arambulo 57 was the former president of the california 
overseas bank a los angelesbased bank indicted with arambulo and 
the marcoses in october 1988 
arambulo who had been a fugitive until his surrender monday to 
fbi agents in new york pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy 
to commit mail fraud 
he was accused of taking part in a scheme to fraudulently obtain 
insurance from the federal deposit and insurance corp for the 
california overseas bank which prosecutors say was secretly owned 
by marcos 
us district judge john keenan revealed at the hearing that 
arambulo had signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors 
assistant us attorney charles labella declined to say whether 
arambulo would be called as a witness at mrs marcos trial which 
is scheduled to start march 20 but the plea agreement said he 
would be required to testify at proceedings related to the case 
the conspiracy charge against arambulo has a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine he originally was charged 
with racketeering and racketeering conspiracy which both carry 
maximum sentences of 20 years in prison 
in his ruling on mrs marcos case keenan also refused to hold 
an evidentiary hearing on the abduction allegation 
keenan noted that an entourage of 122 people accompanied the 
couple when they left the philippines for their home of exile in 
hawaii in february 1986 when marcos was toppled in a revolution 
this was more akin to a troop movement than a kidnapping 
the judge said in a written opinion of their departure 
the october 1988 indictment accused the marcoses of siphoning 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury to buy 
manhattan real estate and art they also were charged with 
embezzling 165 million from several banks 
marcos died in hawaii on sept 28 at age 72 
in his decision keenan outlined mrs marcos account of events 
that led to the couples arrival in hawaii on feb 26 1986 after 
weeks of escalating antimarcos sentiment in the philippines 
including attacks by rebels on the presidential palace 
the judge said mrs marcos claimed that at no time did she agree 
to leave the country she said she refused an offer of safe 
haven in the united states made to her by thenfirst lady nancy 
reagan in a telephone conversation shortly before the marcoses left 
the philippines 
mrs marcos said she believed us officials were going to 
escort them to her husbands native province in the philippines and 
that she had no idea they were being taken to hawaii 
in rejecting the kidnapping claim keenan quoted a press 
statement by marcos two days after their arrival in hawaii in which 
marcos said he was there under the hospitality of the us 
government and that he and his wife were treated with the utmost 
respect and generosity

a federal appeals court on wednesday upheld 
an agreement that forces a former cia agent to get permission from 
the agency before publishing a manuscript about his experiences in 
vietnam 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld a lower court judge who refused to modify a permanent 
injunction against frank w snepp iii 
snepp a cia agent in vietnam for eight years resigned from the 
agency and in 1977 published decent interval a book about his 
experiences 
the federal government sued snepp for violating an employment 
agreement to submit all writings in advance to the cia in 1980 
the us supreme court ruled in favor of the agency 
since then snepp and the cia have agreed on publication of 18 
manuscripts of books and other works by snepp 
the latest lawsuit arose out of a disagreement over snepps 
plans to write a script for a television miniseries on his 
experiences in vietnam 
after prolonged negotiations the cia approved the script but 
the television deal had already fallen through snepp sued to 
modify the injunction to place the burden on the cia to initiate 
judicial proceedings if he and the agency could not agree on a 
manuscript 
the appeals panel agreed with us district judge james c 
cacheris of alexandria that snepp was trying to alter the 1980 
supreme court ruling 
he is essentially arguing that the original decision in his 
case should have placed the burden on the cia to see judicial 
review reasserting the merits of his case does not however 
justify altering an injunction the appeals court said

alaska officials expressed relief 
wednesday that a proposed federal plea bargain fell through and 
exxon corp was indicted on criminal charges in the nations worst 
oil spill 
i was tremendously relieved because i was worried that we were 
going to see some settlement that wasnt in the interests of 
alaska said state rep david finkelstein of anchorage 
the state lobbied the us justice department to reject the plea 
bargain with exxon saying it would hurt alaskas efforts to win 
civil damages from the multibilliondollar oil company 
we felt the proposed plea bargain did affect our civil 
litigation and we squawked about it gov steve cowper said 
cowper said it appeared from the fivecount indictment issued 
tuesday that the federal government was throwing the book at 
exxon and i think that is probably appropriate 
us attorney general dick thornburgh said tuesday that the plea 
bargain fell through because of state officials objections and 
because of exxons unwillingness to meet the governments terms 
several state officials alleged the plea negotiations were part 
of an attempt by the bush administration and exxon to limit the oil 
companys exposure to large criminal fines 
exxon has a very powerful influence theyre very powerful in 
the economic clout they carry in washington dc as well as in 
juneau it doesnt surprise me that they attempted to do an end 
run sen jay kerttula whose district includes part of 
oilfouled prince william sound said wednesday 
sen mike szymanski of anchorage said it appeared the 
administration was trying to cut a deal and let exxon at least 
evade the criminal prosecution which would then save them on the 
civil side 
while the federal government has handled the criminal case the 
state has focused on civil claims stemming from the spill the 
state also is prosecuting former tanker skipper joseph hazelwood on 
felony criminal mischief and other charges stemming from the spill 
the new york times in its thursday editions quoted 
unidentified justice department officials as saying the 
departments attempt to reach a plea bargain was motivated largely 
by the desire to avoid a long trial it might lose the officials 
said they face a difficult court battle to convict exxon and said 
the government remains open to the possibility of a negotiated 
settlement the newspaper reported 
the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
north slope crude in the sound march 24 killing countless birds 
and marine mammals and disrupting alaskas lucrative fisheries 
under the proposed plea bargain the federal government would 
have abandoned its commitment to help the state in its civil 
litigation state attorney general douglas baily said 
state officials also criticized the justice department for the 
secrecy surrounding the plea negotiations rep gene kubina of 
valdez said the indictment ensures the criminal case will be heard 
in public 
finkelstein said it was in exxons best interest to reach a plea 
bargain privately before the indictment was filed now i think 
its much less likely that a settlement will occur in a form that 
would hurt alaska he said 
exxon faces more than 700 million in possible penalties if 
convicted the money would go into the federal treasury but 
federal law gives the judge discretion to order restoration of the 
environment 
state officials said any money from the case should go to 
restore the environment of the sound and the gulf of alaska to the 
condition it was in before the spill 
the money shouldnt just go into the federal treasury said 
sen fred zharoff of kodiak i think we ought to be looking at 
ways and means of protecting the resources 
szymanski maintained the federal government has an obligation to 
help restore the environment and improve the coast guards 
monitoring of tanker traffic out of valdez 
state officials said large penalties are needed to ensure exxon 
and other oil shippers take the precautions necessary to prevent 
oil spills 
when you get up there close to a billion dollars its bound 
to get their attention house speaker sam cotten said

reasons was drafted as model legislation by the national 
righttolife committee in the wake of last summers us supreme

a bill is always alive as long as the session is on said 
democratic sen gene waldorf after his bill failed on a tie vote in 
the 16member senate health and human services committee 
a bill has been resurrected before waldorf said 
committee defeat is not the end of action on a bill 
the vote followed nearly six hours of testimony from state and 
national leaders on both sides of the abortion debate 
although minnesota was long associated in national politics with 
the liberalism espoused by former vice president walter mondale an 
abortion rights supporter it has been a stronghold of 
antiabortion sentiment 
as the lawmakers debated nearly 2000 prochoice activists 
chanting choice exchanged taunts outside the capitol with a 
small group of abortion foes shouting life no arrests were 
made 
proponents say the legislation would be the toughest enforceable 
antiabortion measure in the nation prohibiting an estimated 93 
percent of the abortions performed in the state 
those who want this bill to become law impugn the moral 
dignity of minnesotas women kate michelman executive director 
of the national abortion rights action league told a rally 
wednesday morning before the bill was taken up by the senate 
committee 
they are implying that you cannot be trusted to make these 
decisions 
also wednesday lawmakers in annapolis md conducted a hearing 
on four abortion restriction bills and one prochoice bill the 
hearing attracted an overflow crowd that left about 150 people 
mostly abortion opponents standing with protest signs outside a 
legislative building 
in minnesota waldorf tried unsuccessfully to have the measure 
taken up in the house first he had predicted the bill would lose 
on a tie vote in the senate committee because the committee had 
been stacked against the bill by majority leader roger moe who 
supports abortion rights 
the house health and human services committee held hearings on 
the antiabortion measure tuesday and wednesday and is to debate it 
friday 
as the senate hearing opened waldorf told the committee we 
are deciding who shall live and who shall die who does and who 
does not belong to the community of legal protection 
jackie schwietz coexecutive director of minnesota citizens 
concerned for life said the abortion debate should not center on a 
womans right to choose 
the question is not who decides but who gets killed she 
said 
but opponents said the bill clearly violated us supreme court 
decisions including the landmark 1973 roe vs wade decision which 
legalized abortion and last summers socalled webster decision 
which allowed states to impose some restrictions on abortions 
the bills provisions blatantly and unquestionably are 
unconstitutional in their entirety said suzanna sherry 
professor of constitutional law at the university of minnesota 
the author of the house bill democratic rep steve wenzel said 
hes almost certain the measure will be approved by the house 
committee house democratic leaders however had indicated it was 
possible no vote would occur in the house committee if the bill 
were defeated by the senate committee or if the senators did not 
vote 
democratic gov rudy perpich considered an ally by abortion 
opponents has said he would sign whatever abortion legislation 
reached his desk if it were approved of by both house and senate 
democratic leaders 
but democratic leaders are split on the issue 
the measure would allow abortions only in these cases 
rape reported to police within 48 hours of the attack 
incest reported to authorities before the abortion 
pregnancy that threatens the womans life or endangers her 
health 
pregnancy that would result in a child born with profound 
and iremediable physical or mental disabilities incompatible with 
sustained survival 
it also would establish a system of civil penalties for those 
performing abortions and would set out requirements for informing 
pregnant women about the consequences of abortion

to the frustration of the democratic 
governors campaign chairman president bush seems beyond the reach 
of ordinary politicians out there in his own medium at a 
distance from all the rest of us 
if thats so democratic governors helped him get there 
there are 29 of them outnumbering the 21 republicans but that 
opposition majority didnt show at the national governors 
association this week in the antiseptic political atmosphere of 
those conferences the very idea that a democratic governor roy 
romer of colorado was suggesting a budget challenge to the 
republican administration led romer to raise a point of order 
gov richard f celestes bemused complaint about the apparently 
untouchable republican president and his soaring approval ratings 
came near the end of a fourday meeting dominated by bipartisan 
embrace of an education reform program the education goals were 
put together by the governors and the white house but politically 
the issue bears the bush trademark 
there was an undertone of democratic dissatisfaction with the 
presidents education budget complaints that the federal 
investment he proposes doesnt come close to matching the rhetoric 
gov bill clinton dark a leader in the education reform 
drive said bush should be alerting the voters that they are going 
to have to pay more in local and state taxes to get results 
i think that if hes not going to give us the money to do what 
plainly costs more money then he has to be very clear and 
supportive of the governors in doing that at the state level 
clinton said 
but at campaign time governors who raise taxes even for the 
worthiest causes are governors with a potential problem 
as a candidate bush said he wanted to be known as the education 
president with few federal budget dollars to spare for new or 
expanded programs bush went to the governors to propose that they 
chart common goals for educational progress to be attained by the 
year 2000 that led to the education summit bush convened in 
charlottesville va at the end of september 
a task force of governors worked with the administration to 
shape the reform goals which bush announced to the nation in his 
state of the union address with minor changes no dissent and 
little debate those goals were approved by the governors on sunday 
then they went to the white house for dinner and a bush toast 
we come together not as republicans and democrats not as 
partisan competitors but as fellow chief executives with our 
hearts and minds focused on a single goal the future of our kids 
the future of our country 
they went back the next day to meet with the president then to 
stand behind him as he praised their part in the firstever 
national education goals and objectives to pave the way for a 
decadelong commitment to excellence in education for all 
americans 
but the questions of cost and of raising the money remain 
unanswered the goals are bipartisan but the taxes it will take to 
attain them will be guaranteed campaign issues 
gov cecil andrus didaho said none of it will work if he 
provides the rhetoric and we have to provide the resources 
house speaker thomas s foley told the governors he doubted bush 
could be an education president by proposing a meager 2 percent 
increase in federal spending on education 
the governors politely requested that part of any peace dividend 
flowing from defense spending cuts be devoted to education romer 
of colorado wanted them to tell the president he should shift 
substantial federal resources from defense to education and 
other needs but they wouldnt go that far 
and when a republican governor suggested the vague language they 
did adopt drew a line against bush romer raised a point of order 
saying he was being misquoted 
i didnt in any way say that i think we need to stand against 
the president he said 
but the democrats are after all the opposition party and 
consensus isnt likely to survive the election season thirtysix 
states are electing governors this year education and taxes will 
be among the issues in almost every state campaign and bush will 
be involved in some 
ohio gov celeste chairman of the democratic governors 
association said the bush white house is adept at boosting 
republican candidates by helping them raise funds and mobilize 
party workers 
this is one very politically smart white house said 
celeste i can understand why george bush dominates an arena 
in which we are all sort of bit players 
he said democratic campaigners will find effective ways to 
counter bush we would underestimate the president at our own 
peril celeste said

if you already have a halfdozen credit cards 
and hardly use them youre probably wondering why more banks are 
beseeching you to apply for theirs 
many use sales pitches that include waived annual fees 24hour 
card replacement protection instant 5000 cashadvance limits 
preapproved applications and bonuses that range from free 
travel to car rental discounts this aggressive marketing to peddle 
credit cards may seem even more curious in view of rising default 
rates for many types of loans a growing number of debttroubled 
banks a record number of bankruptcies and a slowly emerging 
backlash against the 1980s era of spending borrowed money 
credit cards nonetheless remain one of the most profitable 
segments of the banking industry the percentage of late payments 
remains relatively low and actually has declined compared with some 
years ago industry experts say 
moreover interest charges on many credit cards exceed 18 
percent much higher than most other types of consumer loans 
making them even more attractive to an industry struggling to find 
new ways of making money 
people who said the credit card market was saturated 3 or 4 or 
5 years ago probably had to swallow a good bit of that crow said 
bruce brittain head of britain associates inc an atlantabased 
marketing strategy consultant that researches credit card use 
even a few new credit cards discover from sears and and optima 
from american express have muscled into millions of wallets 
there also are indications that japan is headed this way with the 
jcb japan credit bureau card the most widely accepted plastic in 
the east 
there is no indication that credit card growth is leveling off 
daniel marx program associate at bankcard holders of america a 
washingtonbased consumer group said outstanding debt on all types 
of credit cards in 1989 totaled 182 billion vs 82 billion at 
the beginning of the decade 
last year 224 million americans held the two most common types 
of bank credit cards mastercard and visa vs 120 million in 1980 
he said 
banking experts say a catalyst for this explosion is the ease 
with which banks can obtain screening information about potential 
customers drastically lowering their cost of signing up 
creditworthy users 
banks once went on what amounted to fishing expeditions mailing 
applications en masse when the credit card business was in its 
infancy some banks simply sent the cards and hoped users would pay 
their bills now many banks first go to credit bureaus which 
routinely sell them computerized lists of names screened by age 
group income and debts 
banks can say i need the names of all males over 48 years 
old who make more than 75000 a year and have 15000 of available 
credit marx said 
the computer will spit out this information for a price 
theres a lot of this that goes on this is where you get your 
preapproved credit card you fit into a niche that the banks have 
drawn up 
this explains for example why a new yorker who has several 
cards may get a solicitation from a small bank in st louis to sign 
up for its visa or mastercharge or a californian will get one from 
an obscure bank in delaware 
what also has happened many experts say is that consumers have 
acquired so many cards they are becoming more selective about which 
ones they use this has intensified the competition 
a bank cant sit back anymore and wait for a customer to use 
its card said virginia stafford a spokeswoman for the american 
bankers association a washington trade group of commercial banks 
what the issuer has to do is make sure when you open your wallet 
you pull out its card not someone elses 
many credit card experts caution that users who are wondering 
whether to sign up for new cards should carefully read the fine 
print of their applications especially regarding interest rates 
and grace periods which can vary widely they also say the 
preapproved enticement in many cases simply means your name 
was culled from a preapproved list 
theyre still going to check your credit brittain said 
if they discover anything about you youre still going to get 
bounced 
others say the net effect of the marketing assault on credit 
card users is good mostly because it reflects competition that is 
providing more choices 
we feel that frankly its an opportunity for the consumer to 
shop said jay muzychenko vice president of the national 
foundation for consumer credit a creditcounseling organization in 
silver spring md 
our position is that bottom line you dont have to take the 
cards just because theyre offered

when bertrand blier develops a screenplay he 
writes with specific people in mind since the french filmmakers 
stories are usually a little crazy he wants his actors the same 
way 
i need an interesting starting point said the director of 
the certifiably insane too beautiful for you trop belle pour 
toi which won the jurys special prize last summer at cannes 
and get out your handkerchiefs preparez vos mouchoirs 
winner in 1978 of the academy award for best foreign film 
to have the movie start with something crazy you need the 
sort of actors that are crazy enough themselves to make it 
credible he said 
good actors the director insists are a little deranged like 
his friend gerard depardieu the star of too beautiful for you 
and get out your handkerchiefs as well as bliers menage 
and cold cuts buffet froid 
they met in 1973 when blier was casting for going places 
les valseuses and depardieu was an unknown actor 
i was a little hesitant to hire him because that was a very 
important charatcer in the film blier recalled for six 
months every day depardieu would come to the office with a 
different costume on to convince me he could play different 
characters one day he was very funny the next day he was sad and 
distraught its extraordinary 
depardieu got the part and blier gave him the chance to make 
good on the promise of his extended audition to do anything 
in get out your handkerchiefs depardieu decides his unhappy 
wife needs a lover and recruits a total stranger for the job in 
the middle of a restaurant in cold cuts he plays an 
unemployed man who accosts a stranger in a subway station and rants 
about his dreams of murder in menage he is a thief who again 
inflicts himself on total strangers and takes over their lives 
the films are in the spirit of those screwball comedies of the 
1930s such as my man godfrey and the thin man timing is 
essential quick enough to make audiences laugh but not so fast 
that the story loses believability and no matter how warped the 
humor gets the actors have to play it straight 
each film is like a game blier explained with each new 
movie you have to set your rules and you have to explain your rules 
to the public if you want them to be able to play with you 
he admires american director billy wilder who depended on 
actors such as jack lemmon and walter matthau to hustle along the 
story blier says depardieu is ideal for that kind of comedy 
because hes quicker than other actors 
the entire movie just goes a lot faster blier said even 
in a love scene everything goes very fast the other actors even 
the very good ones they tend to listen to what theyre saying 
contemplate themselves he doesnt do that 
with too beautiful for you imagine shedevil with the 
husband abandoning meryl streep and running off with roseanne barr 
depardieu is a respectable upperclass family man who falls in love 
with his homely secretary josiane balasko while spurning his 
beautiful wife carole bouquet 
blier noted that too beautiful for you was harder to shoot 
than his earlier films because there was less action and more 
emphasis on affairs of the heart deparidieu reluctantly had to 
slow down 
depardieu was feeling rather uneasy when they were shooting 
the movie because he was under the impression that he had nothing 
to do he likes to act he prefers to act hes always looking at 
the women and doing nothing when he wanted to do something i 
said no dont move only look 
blier the son of actor bernard blier was born in 1939 in 
paris through his father blier met french directors henrigeorges 
clouzot and jacques becker and soon decided he wanted to make 
films too 
i was 15 16 and it came to my mind that that was the only 
profession for me blier said its the only profession where 
you take yourself for god pretend youre god for a while 
his first commandment remains thou shalt be insane and no 
exceptions are allowed one poor actor was even banished for signs 
of excessive normal behavior 
the first scene of buffet froid was very difficult for me 
because i shot the scene with another actor who was not michel 
serrault and it was a disaster blier said 
i called michel serrault and he came for two nights to shoot 
his scene only michel serrault was crazy enough for the beginning 
of this film i cant work with actors who are not like that

twentyfive years after the march to 
montgomery selmas blacks and whites still separated socially 
are nearing political equality and are at the barricades of 
protest again 
the goal of the black demonstrators a quartercentury ago was 
clearcut and fundamental gaining the right to vote 
the march 7 1965 assault on the protesters by alabama state 
troopers and other lawmen a clash known in civil rights annals as 
bloody sunday generated widespread support for the march and for 
the passage of the voting rights act which ensured blacks no 
longer would be denied voting rights through chicanery or 
intimidation 
todays protesters use the same 60sstyle tactics of marches 
and sitins but their targets are narrower political control of 
selmas school system and stopping the impending ouster of the 
citys first black school superintendent 
organizers planned a reenactment sunday of the 54mile march to 
the capitol in montgomery with participants including the rev 
jesse jackson the rev joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference and rep john lewis dga a 
former leader of the student nonviolent coordinating committee 
lowery heads the atlantabased organization founded by the rev 
martin luther king jr who led the second march that reached 
montgomery guarded by federal troops two weeks later lewis led the 
hundreds of demonstrators to selmas edmund pettus bridge on bloody 
sunday suffering a bloodied head for his efforts 
lewis isnt the only familiar face returning from 1965 
city council president carl morgan and mayor joe smitherman held 
those same posts 25 years ago when selma now about 53 percent 
black had no black public officials blacks now hold four of the 
nine city council seats and three of five dallas county commission 
seats 
smitherman and morgan are quick to list other milestones of 
racial progress a district judge is black as is an assistant 
police chief and the president of wallace community college a 
black also has served as president of the embattled city school 
board an 11member appointive body with five black members 
a lot of things have changed morgan said theres no 
question about that youve got a black state senator and two 
black state representatives that represent the district selma is 
in 
a new congressional district with a black majority could be 
carved out of central alabama after the census is completed giving 
the state its first black congressman this century 
but selmas black and white residents still live largely in 
separate neighborhoods and tend not to socialize 
a white former city councilman george cap swift noted for 
example that the city has two elks clubs two american legion 
posts and two first baptist churches one for each race 
morgan sees an ulterior motive in the current controversy 
engulfing selma which involves the whitemajority school boards 
refusal to renew the threeyear contract of superintendent norward 
roussell at the end of this school year 
if that situation had not come up something else probably 
would have to focus on the 25th anniversary of the 1965 voting 
rights act said morgan a colonel in the alabama national guard 
when it was federalized to help protect the marchers 
the view of a manufactured controversy to coincide with the 
anniversary is strongly disputed by rose sanders a leader of the 
protests which have included sitins at city hall and at the only 
public high school 
mrs sanders said todays protests are designed to make sure 
black children arent segregated through an unfair student 
placement system such a system had been used before roussell began 
trying to dismantle it she said 
blacks and whites go in the same school door but once inside 
they go to separate and unequal classes said mrs sanders like 
her husband state sen hank sanders a harvardeducated lawyer 
smitherman contends mrs sanders and the protesters are trying 
to segregate the schools the 5800student system was 70 percent 
black before the protests began with more than 250 whites 
withdrawing in recent weeks it now is 75 percent black 
feelings against the protesters of 25 years ago remain strong 
too at least in some quarters 
sol tepper sr a member of thendallas county sheriff jim 
clarks posse which tangled with the demonstrators voiced a 
perspective on the bloody sunday clash that he says isnt unique 
the media made criminals out of lawenforcement officials who 
were only trying to enforce the laws of the land said tepper 
81 a wealthy landowner they made heroes out of a bunch of 
vermin lawbreakers who descended on us like plagues out of 
egypt he said 
feelings also run high about the failure of an allblack and a 
biracial committee to work together to prepare for the march 
reenactment scheduled to end saturday in montgomery and the 
commemoration of the voting rights acts passage 
a white banker rex morthland was cochairman of the biracial 
committee commemorating the march his cochairman was selma high 
school principal fd reese the black who invited king to lead 
demonstrations in the city 
but the panel disbanded after morthland said he could not get 
cooperation from the allblack committee which has celebrated the 
voting rights march in past years 
mrs sanders a leader of the allblack group dismissed the 
biracial committee as a tool of the mayor 
last week the whitemajority city council refused to repave 
martin luther king jr street for the 25th anniversary of the 
march with the 54 vote falling along racial lines 
still morthland said the years have brought improvement 
they were tense in 1965 and theyre tense now too but in the 
intervening period i think a great deal of progress has been made 
in racial relations in the city he said 
that might partly be due to a more assertive attitude on the 
part of blacks 
were a different breed than we were in the 60s dr samuel 
lett an obstetrician with a high profile in recent selma protests 
told blacks attending a mass meeting we took things then that we 
wont take now

a look at the souths political corridors 
before and after passage of the 1965 voting rights act reveals 
dramatic gains by blacks but it was only a first step toward black 
electoral victories 
in alabama it took a massive but mostly unheralded court case 
launched in mobile in the late 1970s to restructure scores of 
local governments that had used atlarge election systems to 
effectively bar blacks from office 
the voting rights act eliminated the voter registration 
roadblocks candidate qualification rules and other discriminatory 
practices that kept elected offices tantalizingly out of reach for 
blacks 
but it wasnt until the us senate extended the act in 1982 
that language was included protecting minorities from election laws 
with discriminatory effects even if their initial intent was not 
without having to prove intentional discrimination civil rights 
lawyers were able to attack the atlarge election systems that 
diluted black voting strength in cities and counties where blacks 
were the minority of the population 
the litigation was based largely on the mobile case styled 
bolden vs city of mobile which led to a ruling mandating the 
dismantling of the citys commission form of government the 
members of which were elected atlarge it was replaced with a 
sevenmember council elected by districts including at least three 
blackmajority districts 
by 1988 the use of atlarge elections had all but disappeared 
in alabama with court action the most crucial mechanism for 
change said historian peyton mccrary who studied the voting 
right acts impact on alabama and other southern states 
another historian chandler davidson of rice university has 
called it a second reconstruction 
as late as 1979 alabamas 400 municipalities had only 94 black

the agriculture department can get secretive 
over the darndest things sometimes costs of remodeling offices 
whos on the appointments calendars where the secretary goes on 
vacation things like that 
when it chooses the deparment can ballyhoo with the the best of 
em annual yearbooks new programs that dont cost much and white 
house projects that require a rural spin by appropriate 
agencies for example 
but there are some goingson that often are kept under cover for 
years sometimes forever 
so it wasnt really surprising that the usda clammed up tighter 
than a hounds jaws on a ham bone after the washington post 
reported feb 20 that president bush has asked for 65 million in 
fiscal 1991 for the study of voracious caterpillars to kill coca 
plants in south america 
coca leaves are the raw material from which cocaine is refined 
and the bush administration says they are prime targets in the war 
on drugs 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said no 
biological war was in the works and bolivia and peru said that 
while they wanted help in getting farmers to switch crops 
cocaeating worms are not wanted 
it didnt take long for information lids to clang shut at usda 
nobody was talking about the departments cocahungry caterpillars 
and the experiments 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter declined to provide 
further details but told reporters the experiments may send a 
message to the drug lords about us determination on the issue 
the department issued a statement attributed to assistant 
secretary charles e hess who oversees usdas science and 
education programs 
hess said the department in full cooperation with other 
agencies has been involved in projects to eradicate plants 
from which illicit drugs are derived 
further he said these projects have not been publicized due 
to the obvious need for security of personnel and facilities 
accordingly the department is not at liberty to comment on the 
specifics of these programs 
the usda has had considerable experience in clandestine 
operations such as the decades of involement with the military in 
biological warfare projects during and after world war ii such 
us weapons were banned in 1969 
one twovolume report which was removed from the secret list in 
the late 1970s showed that usdas research in biological warfare 
was concentrated on the antipersonnel aspects of war 
there are also smaller programs in antianimal and anticrop 
bw biological warfare as outgrowths of the world war ii effort 
the report said the antianimal program was closely linked to 
the antipersonnel program since certain diseases produced effects 
in humans and animals and the scientific disciplines involved are 
identical or very similar 
according to the old reports the first limited bw retaliatory 
capability was achieved in 1951 when an anticrop bomb was 
developed tested and placed in production for the air force 
the first antianimal test was conducted in july 1951 but was 
discontinued three years later because it was concluded the program 
lacked military worth 
after sputtering a few times the anticrop program by 1969 
included three biological agents stem rust of wheat and rye and 
rice blast 
between 1951 and 1957 wheat stem rust spores and rye stem 
rust spores were produced from innoculated crops at planting sites 
located on government installations the report said the 
harvested spores were shipped to edgwwood arsenal md for 
classification drying and storage this operation was terminated 
in 1959 by the air force 
however that wasnt the end of the program to develop a wheat 
rust weapon between 1962 and 1969 rust spores were grown again at 
government sites with the material shipped to the rocky mountain 
arsenal for processing and storage 
all wheat rust spores were destroyed by february 1973 the 
report said rice blast inventories including final deliveries to 
fort detrick md were destroyed the previous year 
the roots of biological weaponry such as cocaeating 
caterpillars go back many years at least to world war i 
there is incontrovertible evidence for example that in 1915 
german agents inoculated horses and cattle leaving united states 
ports for shipment to the allies with diseaseproducing bacteria 
the report said 
in world war ii a formal stamp was put onto us efforts in the 
summer of 1942 when the war research service was approved by 
president franklin roosevelt 
appropriate liaison was maintained with the armed services 
the us public health service the department of agriculture and 
the department of interior the report said

creditors of drexel burnham lambert group inc 
say they will oppose the companys plan to have its own directors 
supervise the liquidation of the wall street powerhouse that 
collapsed like a house of cards 
drexel asked a bankruptcy judge tuesday to allow three of its 
top executives rather than a courtappointed examiner manage the 
liquidation of the companys securities subsidiary and other units 
the move came as us trustees office appointed a 17member 
committee to represent creditors in the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings for drexel which sought bankruptcy protection feb 13 
after a cash crisis 
but creditors said they would oppose the move maintaining that 
the executives who ran the company as it deteriorated in the last 
year including chairman john sr shad should not oversee its 
dismantling 
i think its the job of the creditors to have input into this 
dissolution said sylvan schefler a former drexel managing 
director who quit six months ago after 30 years at the firm and who 
was named to the creditors committee schefler and dozens of other 
exdrexel workers are owed payment for stock holdings they were to 
receive after leaving the firm 
more than 300 creditors drexel shareholders and lawyers 
attended the organizational meeting at which drexel chief 
executive frederick h joseph said the company was trying to 
maximize the value of the assets 
drexel burnham lambert inc the brokerage unit and other 
subsidiaries have liquidated more than 86 percent of their 
multibilliondollar securities portfolios and other assets since 
the parent sought bankruptcy protection 
we know we tried as hard as we could were terribly sorry to 
be in this position joseph told the gathering at this time 
our job is to salvage as much value as possible 
drexel chief financial officer richard wright said the firms 
total assets had been reduced to 69 billion from 286 billion at 
the end of 1989 while liabilities had fallen to 62 billion from 
278 billion stockholders equity now is 700 million down from 
844 million he said 
drexel officials said the firm lost 65 million from jan 1 
until the bankruptcy filing 
creditors said they would demand more information about drexels 
past and present financial activities especially the liquidation 
they also said they would seek to examine why drexels subsidiaries 
were not placed into chapter 7 liquidation proceedings where a 
court would monitor the dissolution 
many people involved in the case believe creditors will seek to 
force drexel into chapter 7 where company management would have a 
reduced role in the firms breakup 
what theyve done is take the court out of play said 
attorney stuart hirshfield who represents a major creditor on the 
committee theyre created an environment in which everythings 
going to have to be reviewed instead of checked out in advance 
drexel attorneys asked us bankruptcy judge harold buschman iii 
to give responsibility for selling assets of drexels subsidiaries 
to the companys threemember oversight committee created last 
year as part of the firms federal securities fraud settlement 
the subsidiaries are not in chapter 11 and therefore do not have 
to report asset sales and other activity to the judge but drexels 
top unsecured creditors have questioned the rapid disbursement of 
assets and other payments including 260 million in cash and stock 
bonuses paid to employees late last year 
drexel lawyers maintained that having the threemember committee 
monitor the liquidation was not a conflict because company 
executives as stockholders in the parent also are owed money and 
want to maximize asset values 
the committee would report directly to the judge and allow 
creditors access to the process the attorneys said placing an 
outsider in charge would slow the process and endanger gaining 
maximum value for the assets 
first city bancorp has filed a motion asking the judge to 
appoint an outside examiner to look into the company and its 
dissolution a hearing is scheduled for thursday 
the oversight committee consists of shad who is a former head 
of the securities and exchange commission roderick hills a 
washington lawyer and former sec chairman and ralph saul chairman 
of peers amp co and a former american stock exchange president all 
three are drexel board members 
the panel was formed as part of a settlement with the sec last 
april in which drexel overhauled its management and agreed to plead 
guilty to six felonies and pay 650 million in penalties to settle 
charges in the governments insider trading investigation 
drexel has fired almost 3700 of its 5380 employees drexel 
officials said at the creditors meeting they expected to reduce the 
staff to about 200 within one month

the head of drexel burnham lambert inc said the 
firm tried to rebound from its guilty plea to securities crimes and 
a series of financial setbacks but in the end we failed 
in his first public comment since drexels parent filed for 
bankruptcy protection chief executive frederick h joseph told a 
meeting of creditors tuesday that the firms demise began with its 
december 1988 decision to admit to six felonies and pay 650 
million in penalties rather than face racketeering charges 
we fought for a year he said we lost the battle 
joseph blamed a declining investment environment particularly 
in the junkbond field drexel once commanded for spurring the 
financial crisis he also appeared to blame federal regulators for 
not forcing commercial banks to extend credit to the firm in its 
dying days 
drexels parent filed for chapter 11 protection on feb 13 after 
it defaulted on 100 million in shortterm debt the investment 
bank already has fired about 3700 of 5400 employees and 
liquidated most of its securities holdings as it closes down 
operations 
joseph said the firm needed a bridge loan of 250 million to 
300 million to get through what appeared to us to be a 60day 
difficult period as collateral drexel would have put up its 
highly illiquid 11 billion portfolio of junk bonds 
after discussions on the night of feb 12 joseph said he 
believed that gerald corrigan head of the new york federal reserve 
board was encouraging commercial banks to provide the loans 
but in a 1 am conference call hours later with securities and 
exchange commission chairman richard breeden and treasury 
department officials the government closed the window on drexel 
saying it wouldnt bail out the firm or encourage anyone else to do 
so 
they saw no daylight here and felt the best thing for the 
market and for drexel creditors and shareholders would be to file a 
chapter 11 proceeding joseph said the decision was approved 
at a 6 am drexel board meeting on feb 13 
joseph said drexel had managed to make 50 million in the first 
half of 1989 largely from its underwriting of a record junkbond 
offering to finance the rjr nabisco takeover but then it was hit 
with 160 million in writeoffs from sour junk bond financings for 
integrated resources inc which also has filed for bankruptcy 
protection and paramount petroleum co 
drexel paid 500 million of its 650 million in government 
penalties last september when the junk bond market and drexels 
large portfolio of the securities plummeted drexel lost 86 
million in october alone when the stock market plunged including 
25 million in arbitrage trading in ual corp 
in november the firm began experiencing problems meeting its 
obligations on commercial paper a form of shortterm credit that 
drexels parent relied upon by january the parent was taking 
capital from the brokerage subsidiary to help repay its commercial 
paper debt 
federal regulators stopped the drain because the brokerages net 
capital was approaching minumum requirements and when bank 
financing became unavailable the drexel party ended 
drexel lost 40 million last year and about 65 million in 
january and february fees from investment banking had dried up 
the firm forced employees to take some of their compensation in 
stock but that failed to raise enough cash to stem the tide 
we went throuygh the year the difficulties piled up on us 
joseph said its clear that the end of the story is we didnt 
make it we failed

ford motor co has trouble bringing new 
cars to market faster because it doesnt do a good enough job 
solving problems early in the development process the companys 
outgoing chairman says 
donald petersen who retires thursday after nearly 41 years with 
the nations no 2 automaker said tuesday that japanese companies 
do a better job of solving problems early and consequently can 
bring a new car to market faster 
but he added theres a danger in that a blurring of the 
distinctions between old and new models 
we dont do a good enough job up front early in the game 
petersen said we make far too many changes 
on the other hand he said japanese automakers make a decision 
on a product and march forward ruling out lateinthecycle 
changes that could help sell the vehicle but also contribute to 
delays that speed creates its own problems he said 
the japanese are changing their rate that isnt necessarily 
doing them a lot of good petersen said i dont think im 
abnormal in my inability to identify one car from another 
one of the companies with an exceptionally quick product cycle 
time is honda motor co ltd yet its 1990 accord which honda 
advertises as an entirely new vehicle has been criticized for not 
being distinctive enough in look from earlier models 
although ford has ties to mazda motor co and nissan motor co 
petersen said he admired toyota motor corp more 
they have a very complex product line he said they are a 
very big company and sell in very high volume there are others but 
they are more limited in their product line 
petersen became fords president in 1980 a year in which the 
company lost 15 billion he took over as chairman and chief 
executive officer on feb 1 1985 
that year the company reported 25 billion in profits and ford 
was on its way to setting an industry record of 53 billion in 
earnings in 1988 last year the company made 384 billion for 
several of those years fords earnings eclipsed those of general 
motors corp the nations biggest automaker for the first time 
ever 
petersens departure comes as the us industry struggles to 
hold down costs in a sluggish market and that tries to hold on to 
market share in the face of growing numbers of cars made by 
japanese companies overseas and in the united states 
his successor vice chairman harold red poling will be 
faced with the same problems but only for three years he will 
retire in 1993 and his likely successor will be executive vice 
president allan gilmour 
during the next 18 months gm chairman roger b smith and 
chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca a former ford president also 
will step aside

after months of debate and comment federal 
regulators have voted to bar people who violate major commodity 
futures exchange rules from serving on policy and rulemaking 
panels 
the commodity futures trading commission voted unanimously 
tuesday to approve a new regulation prohibiting rule violators from 
serving on disciplinary committees arbitration panels or governing 
boards of exchanges or futures associations 
the rule would bar violators for three years or for the length 
of any sanction imposed against them by an exchange whichever was 
longer it was first proposed by the cftc staff in september 
in other action the cftc approved an application by the new 
york mercantile exchange to trade futures contracts in natural gas 
the contract is designed to allow gas producers pipeline 
companies distributors and consumers to better determine prices 
and hedge against price fluctuations 
the new disciplinary rule is an outgrowth of congressional 
hearings into the fraud scandals at the nations two largest 
commodity futures exchanges last summer in chicago fortyeight 
people were indicted on charges linked to allegations of fradulent 
trading that surfaced in a twoyear undercover federal 
investigation 
a bill passed by the house and awaiting approval in the senate 
would require the cftc which oversees the futures industry to 
implement regulations barring major rule violators from sitting on 
the disciplinary committees of futures contract markets and futures 
associations 
the new rule will go into effect 30 days after it is published 
in the federal register 
spokesmen for the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago 
board of trade said they now have stiffer rules governing their 
members 
the chicago mercantile exchanges andrew yemma said the cftc 
has already approved the rule change we proposed in mid1989 that 
bars anyone from serving on our board of governors or disciplinary 
committees for a period of five years if they have a major 
disciplinary history 
at the board of trade michael oconnell said the board of 
directors adopted a resolution in may reaffirming that it is and 
has been the policy of the bot that individual members with a 
history of significant trade practice sanctions will not be 
permitted to serve on the board of directors or exchange 
disciplinary committees 
according to the cftc rule people subject to the threeyear ban 
include those who violate major rules of selfregulated 
organizations such as futures exchanges or federal futures 
regulations people fined a total of more than 5000 in a single 
year for lesser violations also would be barred as well as those 
convicted of certain felonies including securities law violations 
embezzlement and fraud 
the new rule also requires selfregulating organizations to 
notify the cftc whenever it takes a disciplinary action that would 
disqualify an individual from serving on a committee or board 
the organizations also will be required to submit an annual list 
of people removed from committees under the rule

of directors

the companys common stock 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission through 
his company nl industries inc simmons said he plans to introduce 
a proposal at the shareholders annual meeting march 29 to 
prohibit the expenditure of lockheeds funds to repurchase its 
own equity securities at a premium price in transactions in which 
all holders of such equity securities are not allowed to 
participate on equal terms 
such a proposal if passed would prevent lockheed management 
from trying to buy him off by offering abovemarket prices for the 
stock he holds 
that practice is also known as greenmail a play on the word 
blackmail 
simmons has said in the past that he is not a greenmailer 
because all stockholders not just him would benefit from his

paytelevision outlets would grab more sports 
programming from broadcast tv some magazines would have to close 
and thousands of media jobs would be lost if tobacco and alcohol 
advertising were outlawed a new report by an advertiser and media 
group says 
but critics said the report failed to reflect the chance that 
other advertisers would fill the void left by the tobacco and 
alcohol advertisers 
the report was released tuesday by a group of advertisers media 
companies and ad agencies called the leadership council on 
advertising issues whose stated goal is to preserve and enhance 
the freedom to advertise 
our study shows that reduced advertising exacts social and 
economic penalties from the public said reginald brack the time 
warner inc executive who is cochairman of the group 
an author of the report said he hoped the findings would 
encourage discussion of social and economic costs whenever 
proposals to limit or tax advertising of tobacco beer wine and 
liquor are debated 
coauthor william lilley iii president of policy communications 
inc said policymakers often weigh only the social benefits at 
stake when discussing ad bans 
but critics called the findings unrealistic 
its just more scare tactics primarily said george hacker 
director for alcohol programs at the advocacy institute a 
washington dcbased group that often has aligned itself with 
antismoking efforts and campaigns to promote reduced use of 
alcohol 
it fails to take into account the fact that every day new 
products with advertising needs come on the market ready to spend 
tons of money to attract a consumer base the estimates of lost 
jobs and decimation of the industry are quite exaggerated he 
said 
hacker said the television industry recovered fairly quickly 
from the loss of ad revenue resulting from the 1971 ban on tv 
tobacco ads 
but lilley said media alternatives have grown since then and a 
ban on advertising legal products could markedly affect whether a 
wide range of television programming would be available without 
charge to viewers 
the report said beer and wine advertising for instance account 
for about 15 percent of the advertising on sports programs carried 
on the broadcast networks local tv stations and basic cable 
networks such as espn 
but if beer and wine advertising were banned the report said 
the decline in ad revenue would force those outlets to cut spending 
on sports programs 
the report estimated pay cable tv outlets that charge premiums 
over the basic rates or fees for each program would be the big 
winners boosting their sports programming by about 39 percent over 
current projections and paying for it by charging higher fees 
the lack of sports programs would reduce the audience for 
broadcast tv and the smaller audiences would mean less ad revenue 
and fewer resources for broadcasters to bid with for other 
programs the report said 
coverage of some sports such as boat racing might be dropped 
altogether it said 
the losers would be lowerincome consumers who could not afford 
paycable and those without access to cable tv who would be 
deprived of the full range of programs and information currently 
provided by broadcast tv the report said 
the report said a ban on beer and wine advertising would cost 
the broadcast television industry 4232 jobs or 29 percent of its 
work force by 1993 
a ban on tobacco advertising would put 165 magazines out of 
business trimming circulation by about 5 percent and eliminating 
4130 jobs the report said 
such general interest magazines as tv guide mccalls redbook 
and sports illustrated which the report said each get more than 
10 percent of their ad revenue from tobacco ads would feel the 
impact 
magazines with large circulation and low prices generally are 
least able to respond to losses of ad revenue the report said 
because cover price increases trigger sharp drops in circulation 
the report said lowerincome readers would be affected the most 
because they would be the most sensitive to higher magazine prices 
a tobacco advertising ban also would cost 7904 jobs in the 
newspaper business or 15 percent of the work force the report 
said 
the report said a ban on hard liquor advertising would force 84 
magazines out of business and cut magazine employment by 2100 
most severely affected would be mens magazines such as esquire

the exxon corp faces criminal charges and 
700 million or more in possible penalties from last years tanker 
spill that left hundreds of miles of alaska shoreline polluted with 
oil 
a federal grand jury in alaska brought a fivecount indictment 
against the giant oil company and its shipping subsidiary on 
tuesday charging it violated a number of federal laws in 
connection with the exxon valdez oil spill 
the indictment represents our best shot at prosecuting 
this incident attorney general dick thornburgh said in 
announcing the indictment 
the massive spill occurred when the huge tanker veered off 
course in prince william sound and struck a reef on march 24 1989 
spilling 11 million gallons of crude it was the worst oil 
catastrophe in us history and caused widespread damage to 
wildlife and alaskas ecology 
in new york exxon chairman lawrence g rawl in a statement 
called the grounding a tragic accident for which exxon and its 
shipping subsidiary have apologized to the american people 
especially the people of alaska 
nobody willfully grounded the ship or caused the spill said 
rawl 
exxon stock tumbled 2 to 4637 a share in early trading today 
on the new york stock exchange the indictment was announced long 
after the market closed on tuesday 
exxon has spent more than 2 billion in cleanup efforts but 
environmentalists argue that the job is far from completed and the 
total damages to natural resources may not be known for years 
the indictment included two felony and three misdemeanor charges 
that could lead to a total 16 million in criminal fines in 
addition the government said it would seek at least 700 million 
perhaps substantially more in penalties under a separate law that 
allows recovery of twice the amount of proven losses 
thornburgh said the eventual penalties against exxon could be 
substantially higher depending on the amount of losses determined 
at the time of a court verdict 
rawls statement said we will defend ourselves in court 
against these charges we believe there is no statutory basis for 
the amount of the fines mentioned by the us attorney general 
thornburgh told a news conference the indictment was presented 
to the grand jury after a proposed plea deal fell through he said 
the plea talks fell apart because of the unwillingness of exxon to 
meet the governments terms in addition state officials objected 
to part of the proposed agreement 
the indictment charged that exxon employees aboard the tanker 
acted inappropriately and that the corporation willfully and 
knowingly allowed individuals who either lacked the required 
license or were known to be physically or mentally incapable to 
operate the vessel 
the charges stemmed from reports that exxon officials were aware 
that valdez captain joseph hazelwood had a history of drunken 
driving convictions in new york state but was allowed to remain in 
command of the huge tanker 
hazelwood is on trial in a state court in alaska on charges 
including reckless endangerment criminal mischief and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated he has denied being drunk at the time of 
the accident 
the plea bargain discussions resulted in sharp exchanges between 
alaska state officials and the justice department in recent weeks 
in a letter to justice last weekend alaska attorney general 
doug baily accused the department of trying to force the state into 
signing off on an agreement by threatening to withhold continued 
federal involvement in joint federalstate efforts to assess 
damages from the spill 
alaska gov steve cowper said tuesday night that alaska played 
no role in bringing about the federal charges 
the bottom line for the people of alaska is that our 
fisheries our shorelines and our other natural resources harmed by 
this oil spill are returned as much as possible to their original 
state we want to recover whatever is necessary to restore alaska 
to what it was before the spill 
the charges against exxon under the indictment were 
violation of the port and waterways safety act a felony 
violation of the dangerous cargo act also a felony 
violation of the clean water act by illegally discharging 
pollutants into prince william sound a misdemeanor 
unlawfully discharging refuse the oil also a misdemeanor 
violating the migratory bird treaty act stemming from the 
deaths of more than 36000 birds as a result of oil pollution also 
a misdemeanor 
each of the felony charges carries a maximum fine of 500000 
while each misdemeanor counts carries a maximum penalty of 
200000 the justice officials said 
thornburgh said the indictment would not affect the civil 
lawsuits brought by the state of alaska and various environmental 
and other groups against exxon he also said the federal government 
could take separate civil action against the oil company

would provide news pictures from the united states to reuters 
while reuters would provide upi with pictures from other countries 
the agreement was to run for 10 years 
on feb 16 the day the lawsuit was filed reuters said it was 
canceling the agreement and interrupted the exchange for four hours 
upis counterclaim was brought monday the news service denied 
reuters allegations that upis service had declined since the

sentenced to five years in prison for a stock manipulation 
conspiracy discovered after the october 1987 market crash that cost 
clients more than 5 million 
a fraudulent scheme was carried out and resulted in great 
losses to people and firms in the investment community us 
district judge thomas p griesa said at tuesdays sentencing of 
eugene laff 
laff 52 of greenwich conn is the former chairman of haas 
securities corp which collapsed nine days after the crash he was 
convicted in december of five counts of conspiracy securities 
fraud mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
the prosecution maintained that the firm schemed to artificially 
raise the prices of socalled penny stocks inexpensive 
securities traded over the counter by creating false demand for 
the shares a scheme that couldnt be maintained after the market 
dropped 
laff asked the judge for probation so he could earn money to pay 
back the victims of the fraud many of whom have filed civil

britains merchandise trade deficit more than 
doubled in january to an unexpected 198 billion pounds or about 
33 billion at current exchange rates the government said 
wednesday 
the government blamed a drop in britains oil surplus and an 
unusually high level of imports of such items as diamonds for the 
widening gap between imports and exports 
the seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a deficit of 917 
million pounds in december the central statistical office said 
it said the current account deficit soared to 188 billion 
pounds from 817 million pounds the january current account deficit 
was the highest since september 1989 when it totaled 19 billion 
pounds 
excluding the unusual items would reduce the january current 
account figure by about 500 million pounds the office said 
the current account deficit equals the merchandise trade deficit 
plus invisibles trade 
invisibles cover services overseas investment earnings and 
official transfer payments and was estimated to be in surplus by 
100 million pound 
the january figures compare with market expectations of a 
merchandise trade deficit of 122 billion pounds and a current 
account deficit of 13 billion pounds 
exports totaled 86 billion pounds in january down from 87 
billion pounds in december imports totaled 106 billion pounds in 
january up from 96 billion pounds in december

prime minister toshiki kaifu said today that japan 
will do more to ease trade friction with the united states and 
pledged further efforts to reform japanese politics 
kaifu presented his new cabinet to emperor akihito after a long 
wrangle in his conservative party over his insistence on keeping 
scandaltainted politicians out of the administration 
as he was doing so a weekly magazine said it would publish an 
article thursday charging that kaifu received larger donations than 
he has acknowledged from a company at the heart of a 1988 
influencepeddling scandal 
kaifus difficulty in forming a cabinet came shortly before he 
was to leave for california where president bush is expected to 
urge japan to be more conciliatory in sluggish trade talks 
there is no magic word that will erase the 49 billion trade 
surplus kaifu told a nationally televised news conference 
japan will reform import taxes and expand domestic demand he 
said but that is not enough so we will do more if you look 
closely at what were doing in japanus relations youll see how 
hard we are working 
kaifu revealed no details of new initiatives japan might offer 
in his talks friday and saturday with bush in palm springs 
officials in both countries spoke of the need to develop their 
global partnership despite deep problems between the two 
biggest economies in the capitalist world 
but a question mark hangs over the governments political 
strength to take domestic and international initiatives even 
though the scandalplagued governing party won a strong majority in 
the feb 18 parliamentary election 
i think you should see it as a kind of purification kaifu 
said of the election victory in any case the party has been 
reborn with the peoples trust and our mission is to carry out 
political reform 
formation of the 21member cabinet was announced early today as 
the prime minister prevailed in his insistence on a clean 
government a requirement that eliminates the top echelon of his 
liberal democratic party 
kaifu did not speak directly about problems forming the cabinet 
saying he had wanted the best government possible to deal with 
pressing foreign issues as well as domestic problems such as taxes 
welfare and the aging society 
he indicated however that he also would insist on keeping 
scandaltainted politicians out of subcabinet level offices such 
as vice minister posts 
in its march 8 issue which goes on sale thursday shukan 
bunshun magazine said kaifu received a total of 263 million yen 
177100 in donations from recruit co between 1983 and 1987 
when he took office in august kaifu said he received only 144 
million yen 96970 all in legal donations 
in a news conference today kaifu denied he received more i 
have checked thoroughly and reported everything he said it is 
hard to prove the fact that i did not receive additional 
donations when i did not receive them 
foreign minister taro nakayama a holdover from the cabinet 
kaifu formed last summer after two prime ministers resigned in 
quick succession amid money and sex scandals indicated he would 
accompany kaifu to the summit with bush 
trade will be the key issue in the us talks he said and he 
also expected to discuss global issues such as the environment 
population and drugs as well as technology transfers 
bush sent his invitation to kaifu last weekend after us and 
japanese negotiators expressed frustration at lack of progress in 
trade talks us officials said they had hoped for more political 
direction from the japanese side since the japanese elections were 
over 
kaifu 59 comes from a small faction in the liberal democratic 
party but exerted political muscle against more powerful faction 
leaders in keeping out scandaltainted figures 
the struggle showed however that the prime minister may have 
difficulty keeping support of the contenders for power 
referring indirectly to the factional struggles kaifu said 
japan has to clean up money politics and move toward more 
policyoriented elections 
this harks back to the faction question little by little we 
should get rid of them he said 
the liberalleaning newspaper asahi shimbun denounced as a 
disgrace the attempt by former finance minister michio watanabe 
to nominate koko sato to the cabinet sato was convicted on a 
criminal charge in a 1970s lockheed scandal 
kaifu also rebuffed an attempt by former foreign minister 
shintaro abe to name a politician tainted by the recruit scandal 
in which many profited from sales of prelisted shares in a recruit 
subsidiary in return for political favors

senate and white house negotiators are 
pressing towards agreement by thursdays deadline on key parts of a 
compromise clean air package including curbs on automobile 
emissions and acid rain pollution 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who had 
vowed earlier in the week to bring the legislation up for floor 
action no later than thursday backed away from that goal slightly 
after a second straight day of marathon talks that lasted past 
midnight 
its obviously getting more difficult but were still 
hoping mitchell said of the deadline he imposed for floor action 
mitchell said this morning that he expected to conclude the 
private discussions with the administration by the end of the day 
but he could not say if an agreement would emerge 
senate leaders and the bush administration representatives have 
been working for three weeks to craft a compromise bill that will 
gain white house backing and blunt regional opposition from some 
lawmakers 
the discussions tuesday centered on the automobile emission 
control section of the bill which is aimed at dramatically 
reducing urban smog by the end of the decade 
the white house earlier in the week abandoned its staunch 
opposition to a second round of auto tailpipe emission controls 
but details of how such controls might go into effect have thwarted 
agreement among the negotiators participants said 
in all negotiations that last inch is darkness and we are in 
the last inch literally said sen max baucus dmont the 
clean air bills floor leader 
key differences also remained on acid rain controls but that 
largely involves disagreement over whether to accommodate a group 
of midwest senators who want help in paying for costly emission 
controls at the dirtiest coalfired electric plants 
the bush administration and senate leaders who support the 
senate clean air legislation have opposed costsharing assistance 
to the midwest 
sources close to the discussions said the remaining differences 
on acid rain including the costsharing question were not large 
enough to threaten compromise on an overall agreement 
the closeddoor iscussions are aimed at fashioning a legislative 
package that will have the support of the bush administration and 
enough senators to avoid a lengthy floor fight and potential 
filibuster 
lobbyists from the auto industry and those representing various 
environmental groups were staked out near the meeting room tuesday 
night awaiting word of an agreement 
some environmentalists have sharply criticized the closeddoor 
talks maintaining that the tactic was significantly weakening a 
strong senate ill approved by the environment and public works 
committee last november 
its disintegrating before our eyes said richard ayres 
executive director of the clean air coalition and a member of the 
natural resources defense council

usx corp plans to ask the us supreme 
court to review an appeals courts ruling that the company 
discriminated against 8000 black job applicants at a steel mill a 
spokesman said today 
the appeals court last week upheld a 1983 us district court 
decision for the second time the supreme court last year ordered 
the appeals court to restudy the case under more stringent 
standards for proving bias that the high court imposed on june 5 
usx spokesman ernie glenn said the company would seek a review 
of the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruling on the ground that 
the appeals court misapplied the supreme courts new interpretation 
of civil rights law 
the june 5 decision said minorities could not rely solely on 
statistics to prove discrimination but must link the data to a 
specific corporate employment policy 
the decision also let companies justify practices that 
statistically appear discriminatory by showing they followed a 
reasonable employment policy 
the appeals court ruled friday that even under the more 
restrictive guidelines the black job applicants in the 
classaction lawsuit had proved discrimination 
the court found that because the positions at the fairless 
hills pa steel mill were for unskilled workers any 
ablebodied person should be competent to perform the job 
but the companys job interviews had a significantly disparate 
impact on blacks as the percentage of successful black 
interviewees was significantly less than the overall percentage of 
successful interviewees chief judge a leon higginbotham jr 
wrote in the appeals court decision other judges taking part in 
the decision were carol los mansmann and max rosenn 
attorney richard z freemann jr who represented the job 
applicants estimated the ruling could cost the steel manufacturer 
nearly 30 million 
im not surprised to learn that freemann said of the usx 
decision to seek review im disappointed that the distribution 
of funds will have to wait awhile but im confident that well 
prevail

many junk bonds apparently are turning out to be true to 
their name the bank and savings and loan industries are littered 
with the casualties of illconsidered ventures 
supposedly sacrosanct real estate markets in places like the 
northeast have turned poisonous even the skyhigh japanese stock 
market seems not to be immune 
those who have suffered from these reversals arent attracting 
much sympathy the feeling among their fellows seems to be 
thats what comes of taking chances 
perhaps so but in the current climate of upheaval some 
students of the subject say the idea of risktaking itself may be 
getting a bad rap 
they argue that just about all business ventures like many 
other things in life are based on running risks 
in this view risk is pretty much a constant part of the 
natural order and even when it cannot be prevented or reduced it 
can be managed to minimize its harmful effects 
when mischief occurs it most often happens because people 
underestimated or just plain ignored the risks they were taking 
as john t reed a specialist in real estate investing put it 
gamblers take risks for the thrill of it investors take 
calculated risks because their calculations show they will be 
better off financially if they do 
the difference reed says in his newsletter real estate 
investors monthly can be illustrated through the simple device of 
a flip of a coin 
a gambler probablya would take an evenmoney bet that a given 
coin flip would turn up heads devotees of lotteries and other 
longshot propositions might even stake small amounts on the chance 
that the coin would land on its edge 
but wise investors would look for some edge in their favor 
before they put their money up on a 5050 proposition like a coin 
flip for example they might demand a payoff of 11 for each 10 
chance they took 
in addition to knowing their statistical chances of success 
investors like to know as precisely as possible the expected value 
of winning and the penalty paid for losing 
on top of that they inquire into the worst possible outcomes 
that could befall them in order to gauge their exposure even to 
freakish damage 
for people who dont patronize casinos what use is all this 
well it turns out there is much more to riskmanagement in the 
world than eschewing gambling 
customers of insurance companies for example merely buy the 
right to transfer a risk they face to an institution that is 
willing to assume it for a price that is usually profitable 
likewise investing of all kinds involves at least an estimate 
of risk the aggressive individual may opt for some vehicle 
with a speculative reputation the conservative investor sticks 
with supposed safety 
but when the information used to make the calculation is suspect 
or not fully understood reed observes to discuss the issue in 
terms of optimism vs conservatism is to descend to mere 
namecalling 
the question is not who is optimistic or who is conservative 
the question is who is right 
either you have the data to calculate your risks or you dont 
inadequate data combined with optimism is still inadequate data 
indeed that combination is more dangerous than inadequate data 
alone

recent upheavals in japans capital markets may put 
a financial squeeze on japanese industry and slow economic growth 
analysts say but few believe a recession will result 
economic conditions are still strong said hiroshi kadota of 
the japan federation of economic organizations financial affairs 
bureau investment is expanding the capital markets are 
returning to a normal trend 
japanese industry for years has been able to raise capital for 
growth at relatively little cost but its fabled markets have shown 
signs of sputtering lately 
the tokyo stock exchange where sony corp for example raised 
27 billion earlier this month to help finance its overseas 
investments has gyrated wildly this year after reaching record 
highs at the close of 1989 the exchanges key index declined by 
some 14 percent before rebounding tuesday and wednesday 
interest rates have been rising since last summer when the bank 
of japan began battling inflation by raising its discount rate 
the interest it charges for loans to commercial banks to 425 
percent from 25 percent anticipation of a further increase has 
send bond prices plummeting in tandem with stock prices increasing 
corporate borrowing costs 
many analysts regard these developments as corrections in an 
overheated capital market rather than a vote of no confidence in 
the underlying economy 
adrian tschoegl an economist with sbci securities asia said 
the fall in the tokyo market is a bit like the new york crash of 
87 everyone cried recession then but nothing much happened 
the tokyo market is coming down from an overheated level the 
effect is going to be very slight 
nevertheless with interest rates up and the stock market down 
some japanese companies apparently are shelving plans to raise 
equity capital in the near future and are turning to their own 
reserves to fuel growth 
several issues were involved in have been pulled back 
tschoegl said 
as much as 68 billion worth of convertible bonds warrants and 
shares were scheduled to come on to the market by the end of march 
several brokers said many of these issues will be deferred they 
said 
equity financing is one of the most important vehicles to 
raise funds for japanese corporations obviously they do not want 
to go ahead now if they believe theyre going to hurt their 
longterm financing said yutaka nakai an analyst with daiwa 
securities co they can be flexible about when to raise funds 
large japanese corporations are able to weather rough sailing in 
the capital markets said kadota because they have vast reserves 
of liquidity he said a poll of business leaders conducted this 
month by his organization found confidence in continued growth was 
high 
toshiaki kakimoto chief economist at sumitomo bank predicted 
japans gross national product growth would decline moderately to 
45 percent in the fiscal year ending march 31 and to 43 percent 
in fiscal 1990 from 53 percent in fiscal 1988 
if the financial environment worsens large companies may have 
to liquidate some of their fixed assets mainly real estate says 
yoshiaki takanashi head of economic research at yasuda trust bank 
real estate will suffer to some extent investment overseas 
may be reviewed he said 
at that point he said if the market deteriorates further 
then a crisis could occur 
but under present conditions he said only small and 
mediumsize companies that rely on bank financing to survive face 
any real hardship

about 27000 gallons of heating oil poured 
into a busy waterway near an exxon corp terminal this morning as 
it was being loaded onto a barge with a hole in it the coast guard 
said 
the no 6 heating oil leaked into the kill van kull a major 
route for barge and tanker traffic that separates bayonne from new 
yorks staten island the coast guard said the spill was 
discovered at about 420 am and had begun about an hour earlier 
authorities said 
exxon indicted just this week on charges stemming from last 
years alaska tanker spill issued a statement saying the company 
was helping out with the cleanup but was not responsible for 
todays spill 
lt jeff crawley a coast guard spokesman said the oil poured 
through a 12inchby6inch hole and forced the closing of the 
busy waterway crawley said he didnt know what caused the hole in 
the barge 
the barge has numerous tanks six or seven and the oil is 
pumped from the facility to the barge said crawley 
the barge owner ekolof marine of staten island ny initially 
estimated the leak at 420 gallons said rick fulton a spokesman 
for the department of environmental protection the coast guard 
revised the figure initially to 24000 gallons and later to 27000 
gallons after studying the site he said 
two environmental cleanup companies hired by ekolof were at the 
scene this morning laying containment booms fulton said the 
spill spans the 3mile length of the kill van kull and sheens 
were spotted as far away as liberty island about five miles 
northeast of the spill site 
exxon issued a statement saying the eklof barge was loading 
heating oil at exxons bayonne terminal but the oil company was 
not involved in the spill exxon said eklof had purchased the oil 
and was loading it for an international customer 
eklof has acknowledged responsibility for the spill and the 
cleanup effort said exxon spokesman jack hollern exxon has 
offered its full cooperation to the coast guard and the barge owner 
in assistance with the spill response a person answering the 
phone at eklofs offices said the company had no immediate comment 
fulton said it was too early to gauge how much damage wildlife 
may have suffered adding that the area where it occured is one 
heck of a developed strip 
the spill is located within miles of the confluence of the kull 
and arthur kill the scene of the jan 12 spill that leaked 
567000 gallons of heating oil from a pipe that connects exxon co 
usas terminal here with the bayway refinery 
exxon is under investigation by the state department of 
environmental protection and the us environmental protection 
agency for the january spill dep and epa officials said they had 
no comment immediately on todays spill 
exxon faces lawsuits from the dep elizabeth and new york for 
the january spill 
todays spill comes one day after a federal grand jury in alaska 
brought a fivecount indictment against exxon and its shipping 
subsidiary on charges they violated federal laws in connection with 
the exxon valdez oil spill off alaska last march 
exxon faces 700 million or more in possible penalties the spill 
of nearly 11 million gallons of crude in prince william sound that

the name of the kansas city star will 
live on when the storied 110yearold afternoon paper where young 
ernest hemingway worked as a reporter merges thursday with its 
morning partner the kansas city times 
many other things will go the stars afternoon publishing 
time its layout and typeface some call it the end of an era 
but editor joe mcguff sees just another stage in the newspapers 
colorful history which began in 1880 in a rough but booming river 
town and includes years when political boss tom pendergast ruled 
the citys voting booths and the papers president roy roberts 
helped persuade dwight eisenhower hed be a good president 
the stars course has included pulitzers corporate buyouts and 
growing competition with tv the star and times have won seven 
pulitzers including a joint award for their investigation into the 
1981 hyatt regency skywalk collapse that killed 114 people 
like hundreds of afternoon papers the star has faced declining 
readership its circulation dropped by 100000 in the 80s and 
stood at 165000 in september the times circulation is 270000 
the stars sunday readership is 416000 
its inevitable and that takes away some of the sting said 
george r burg who started on the desk in 1948 moved up to 
managing editor and now directs philanthropic activities as 
assistant to the publisher people just dont read afternoon 
papers anymore 
william rockhill nelson and samuel e morss started the kansas 
city evening star on sept 18 1880 a debut with a circulation of 
3000 the fourpage paper cost 2 cents nelson bought out his 
partner the next year 
by 1892 circulation was 50000 in 1901 nelson purchased the 
33yearold times which even at the turn of the century was still 
a diehard sympathizer of the confederate cause the words the 
morning kansas city star appeared as a subhead on its masthead 
until 1977 
hemingway joined the star in 1917 covering the train station a 
hospital and police precinct before leaving seven months later to 
join an ambulance unit in italy 
when nelson died in 1915 his will stipulated the paper should 
go to his wife and daughter and then be sold after their deaths 
employees led by nelsons soninlaw irwin kirkwood submitted the 
winning bid in 1926 and established the employee ownership that 
would stand for five decades 
the newspaper earned a reputation as a crusader when it turned 
against pendergast in the mid1930s and the political boss fell 
from power all the way to a prison cell for tax evasion 
in the mid20th century the newspapers president was roberts 
who sat at his desk in the newsroom talking to the republican rich 
and powerful on the phone he persuaded one friend eisenhower to 
run for president 
in 1977 capital cities communications based in new york 
bought the paper for 125 million making millionaires of a few 
stockholders 
they made a lot of changes that resulted in firings and forced 
retirements said joe henderson the papers longtime federal 
court reporter who is retiring it was a bitter time but those 
who survived are certainly a lot better off in salary and fringe 
benefits i think than under the old star 
the merger wont result in any layoffs for the 300 newsroom 
employees 
the times remained in the stars shadow for years times 
reporters for example identified themselves as star reporters 
when doing interviews 
otherwise no one would have known who they were said burg 
but as the stars circulation dropped over the years the times 
got more important its circulation bypassed the stars in 1965 
after the 1977 sale editors placed the two news staffs in 
direct competition for the first time in an effort to improve 
reporting advertising and production staffs worked for both papers 
despite the attempt at direct competition the star in the last 
decade became known for its features while the times concentrated 
on national international and regional news 
now employees and readers await thursday mornings newspapers 
and morning newspapers thereafter 
one lady told me shell have to read half the paper in the 
morning burg said and save the other half for afternoon

hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank 
loans to rep harold ford were nothing more than a shell game 
to hide political payoffs a prosecutor said today at the opening 
of fords bank fraud trial 
but fords attorney said the loans from butcher brother banks 
were legitimate loans that ford fully intended to repay and he has 
repaid 
assistant us attorney gary humble said the bogus loans 
eventually totaling some 15 million were to pay ford for 
political and personal influence on behalf of former tennessee 
bankers jake butcher and ch butcher jr 
the butchers wanted him to use that power for their own 
interests so they lent him money humble said in his opening 
argument there was no way harold ford could repay this money he 
knew it the butchers knew it 
the only thing he could give was his political influence and 
he did 
he said that what appeared to be loans were actually payoffs 
it was not intended that harold ford pay this money back 
humble said 
humble said ford began receiving money from the butcher brothers 
in 1972 when he was a state representative with little money or 
personal property 
as fords political power grew the butcher payoffs also 
increased in size and in the 1980s he received one loan for 
350000 the prosecutor said 
defense attorney william mcdaniels responded to the governments 
charges by proclaiming his clients innocence calling the case 
an attack on harold ford personally it is an attack on his 
political life 
they were not phony loans mcdaniels said they were 
intended to be repaid 
the 350000 loan at issue in 11 of the 19 criminal counts 
against ford was issued by ch butchers nowdefunct southern 
industrial banking corp to a company called tennford inc 
the government contends tennford was a sham company but ford 
says the loan went through tennford to the family funeral home 
nj ford amp sons funeral parlor in his opening statement 
mcdaniels said ford was not responsible for the loan 
after sibc went bust in 1983 ford acted as majority stockholder 
in the funeral home while dealing with a bankruptcy trustee to 
settle the sibc loan for 25000 
ford is charged with conspiracy bank fraud and mail fraud 
he is on trial with three codefendants former butcher 
accountant david crabtree and lawyers douglas beaty and karl 
schledwitz 
the four were indicted in knoxville in april 1987 and the trial 
was moved to memphis at fords request 
ford the only black member of tennessees congressional 
delegation contends he was indicted in knoxville because east 
tennessee is heavily republican and primarily white 
fords congressional district which includes most of memphis 
is twothirds black he was first elected to congress in 1974 
the jury has eight black members and four whites one of the 
jurys two alternates is white the other black

foods corp in 1988 defaulted on a 133 million loan and is 
negotiating with its lenders for additional working capital 
spokesmen said wednesday 
company chairman larry doskocil said the current financial

difficulties the company believes its operations are fundamentally 
sound 
doskocil a leading supplier of precooked pizza toppings and 
other specialty meats acquired the much larger wilson foods an 
oklahoma based meatpacker in a deal valued at about 133 million

the chief regulator of national banks denied 
wednesday that his agency is trying to bring real estate lending to 
a halt in new england 
thats simply not true comptroller of the currency robert 
l clarke told the national council of savings institutions 
we have sounded warnings but the warnings are warnings to 
take care not to abandon the business entirely he said 
clarkes office which supervises 4600 nationally chartered 
banks has urged banks to exercise more caution in real estate 
lending provoking complaints from some in new england who have 
accused regulators of discouraging loans to reliable borrowers 
however clarke said not every real estate loan in new england 
is a bad bet 
if the specific loan is justified do it he said 
there is nothing inherently wrong with real estate or 
construction lending there is nothing inherently wrong with 
dynamite either the problem comes in how you handle them if 
you handle them negligently or with reckless disregard they can 
and will blow you away he said 
many of the real estate loan problems in new england and 
elsewhere are the result of poor management practices specific 
people acting at specific institutions he said

a year ago the eastern airlines terminal at 
sprawling atlanta airport resembled a ghost town shut down by 
angry pickets in what has become one of the longest strikes in 
commercial aviation history 
today the strikers have dwindled to bitter holdouts of the 
machinists union and the terminal pulsates with passengers 
digested and disgorged by eastern jetliners 
but beyond the unmarked doors down corridors to offices and 
employee lounges a revolution is under way eastern is 
transforming with youthful blood about the only things unchanged 
are the name and the bluesilver logo 
once heavily dependent on florida tourism and latin travel 
eastern is redirecting its reach toward business passengers the 
airlines headquarters may be in miami but the most important 
operation is now in atlantas hartsfield international one of the 
worlds busiest airports 
many employees are cherubfaced new hires some flight 
attendants look barely out of their teens and a number of pilots 
are in their 30s they work for less money than their prestrike 
counterparts and harbor none of the labor bitterness that helped 
drag eastern down for years 
to passengers the new eastern not only looks rejuvenated 
but its almost evangelical new employees bubble with conviction 
that theyre on the ground floor of something big 
strikescarred veterans say theres less bureaucratic bickering 
within the airline now many say theyre pulling together like a 
team helped partly by companypaid counseling aimed at overcoming 
the bitterness caused by the strike 
nonetheless it remains unclear whether the new eastern 
which lost 8523 million last year can survive the unions have 
been humbled but the airline has reasserted itself just as the 
economy seems to be weakening leaving even the strongest airlines 
vulnerable 
we face a much more sinister challenge now said james 
ashlock an eastern spokesman in atlanta who is an unofficial 
historian of the airline weve got to make it 
like an aging jet eastern has been stripped and overhauled by 
owner frank lorenzo with the sanction of a federal bankruptcy 
judge the airline filed for protection from creditors soon after 
the strike began and has since sold 8598 million in assets the 
workforce has been cut to about 20000 vs 28000 before the 
walkout 
to easterns management however the airline hasnt been gutted 
as union leaders claim but rejiggered reshaped and rebuilt 
nobodys ever built an airline like this this fast said 
eastern vice president harold holt highestranking manager in 
atlanta he said expanding the atlanta operation during the strike 
was one of the more stressful tasks of his 40 years with the 
company 
you either remain calm or go nuts he said its been 
probably the worst period in my career and also the best 
for holt a softspoken atlanta native that period began march 
4 1989 when eastern pilots and flight attendants walked out in 
solidarity with the machinists and grounded all flights 
holt and his colleagues scrambled to train replacement workers 
to gradually rebuild the flight schedule which went from 295 a day 
to zero overnight in atlanta alone and created havoc in the early 
days of the strike the managers hauled bags and cleaned planes 
while management pilots took over the cockpits 
as the strike progressed the atlanta schedule was increased to 
80 flights a day in july 160 in august and 262 in september 
eastern now has about 270 daily departures from atlanta and its 
target is 315 by mid to late 1990 
nearly a third of easterns workforce is based in atlanta 
including about 1000 pilots 1400 flight attendants 750 
mechanics and maintenance workers 1000 baggage handlers and 1000 
ticket agents cleaners and other workers 
atlantas going to be between 40 and 50 percent of eastern 
airlines holt said 
systemwide the new eastern operates about 800 flights a day 
to 86 cities that will be cut sharply if the federal government 
approves easterns agreement to sell its latin american routes and 
other assets to american airlines for 471 million 
the sale of those routes is a required condition for final 
approval of a new reorganization agreement between eastern and its 
major creditors 
lorenzo recently pulled easterns healthier sister carrier 
continental airlines into the bankruptcy fray in order to gain 
acceptance from the big creditors for its reorganization plan 
continental like eastern a subsidiary of lorenzos texas air 
corp would be required to make some payments to easterns 
creditors under the new plan 
if the sale to american proceeds the importance to eastern of 
miami its latin american hub will diminish still further 
atlanta the business center of the south will become easterns 
key market 
it is in this city that uppity eastern is going nosetonose 
against staid delta air lines the nations fourthlargest carrier 
and a dominant economic force in atlanta its home base 
eastern employees jokingly call an outdoor area of hartsfield 
separating the two airlines facilities the demilitarized zone 
they refer to delta as the big bear across the terminal 
as miamis role in easterns game plan shrinks there is even 
speculation that eastern could sell its maintenance base there and 
move more operations to atlanta this citys civic and business 
leaders have been pressing eastern to transfer everything here 
holt said 
regardless of where eastern concentrates its business there is 
little doubt that the rancorous workermanagement relationship of 
the prestrike years has eased 
at a recent daily briefing for about 30 eastern pilots in 
atlanta half the group was new and half were veterans of the 
strike who had spent months walking picket lines 
lets face it theres been a lot of divisions theres been a 
lot of trauma with these people said todd jennings easterns 
director of flight operations in atlanta but he said the veterans 
wanted to put the past behind them 
the name easterns the same but everything else is 
different

aboard eastern flight 103 ap its breakfast time on a 
weekday morning new yorkto atlanta flight and the youthful cabin 
crew is serving up some corporate boosterism along with the 
rewarmed scrambled eggs 
easterns name is built on their reputation said a 
21yearold flight attendant who identified herself as melody she 
said that reputation drew her to take her first job as a flight 
attendant three months ago after working in the restaurant business 
flight 103 out of new yorks laguardia airport is nearly full 
the passengers a mix of business travelers and leisure fliers but 
even the new enthusiasm doesnt help the boeing 727 buck the lineup 
of planes waiting to take off the 905 departure isnt airborne 
until 935 
melodys colleagues on the flight carlos cardenas and cody 
fulmer also are young enthusiastic and relatively new to eastern 
they are the flip side of the bitter strike against eastern which 
began a year ago and threw thousands of pilots flight attendants 
and machinists out of work 
for the newcomers the dispute that pitted the unions against 
eastern owner frank lorenzo was an opportunity 
i wanted to become a flight attendant so bad said cardenas 
23 who before the strike had worked for eastern in bogota 
colombia as a ticket agent and reservation agent 
as part of lorenzos costcutting strategy the airline has 
hired thousands of new employees at lower pay to replace the union 
strikers many of the replacement workers are young single 
without families and mortgages to support and not especially 
receptive to trade unionism 
eastern flight attendants for example now earn an average 
1688 a month down from 2029 before the strike 
its just like any other job youve got to work your way 
up melody replied when asked if she resented the relatively low 
wages 
insiders estimate that the new employees have cut about 10 years 
off the average age of easterns work force of 20000 from the 
mid40s to the mid30s the minimum age for eastern flight 
attendants is 18 
even the uniforms for flight attendants are new navy blue with 
gold stripes on the sleeves described as a more professional look 
replacing the old khakicolored outfits and red scarves female 
attendants also wear a militarystyle kepi reminiscent of 
stewardess uniforms in the mid1950s some say the jaunty caps make 
them an easy target for the jeers of machinist pickets at airports 
breakfast on flight 103 is scrambled eggs hash brown potatoes 
tiny sausages orange juice and a small blueberry muffin in first 
class its fancier and includes an omelette and fresh fruit salad 
in the cockpit theres a mix of eastern veterans and newcomers 
the captain jon mcclure has flown for eastern 22 years he 
stayed out for six months before crossing the picket line to return 
to work 
mcclure is flying this trip with copilot phil gibson 42 and 
flight engineer dan marouf 34 both hired after the strike started 
i wanted to get this company going i wanted to be part of a 
team said gibson who had flown corporate jets for five years 
before joining eastern last june im not here for the short 
term i plan to make this a career 
mcclure calling the strike illconceived said that now 
new and old pilots are working well together and all the employees 
are hustling more than before asked about easterns future 
prospects he gazed out the cockpit window at a distant point 
im optimistic but it could go either way

treasury undersecretary david mulford said 
wednesday that officials of the seven largest industrial countries 
met in london this week but he refused to confirm a report that 
japan had requested help in stabilizing the value of the japanese 
currency 
i cant answer questions about current exchange rates 
mulford told reporters after an appearance before a congressional 
panel he said he attended the tuesday meeting 
mulford was asked about a report by a japanese news organization 
that officials in that country had asked other major industrial 
countries to keep the yen from falling further 
the kyodo news service quoting a finance ministry source said 
japan made the request at a meeting of deputy finance minsters from 
the industrial countries which are known as the group of seven 
the seven governments the united states japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada often work together to buy and 
sell currencies on the open market to influence their price 
the yen has been declining rapidly against the dollar in recent 
weeks threatening to ignite inflation in japan a decline in the 
yen also risks worsening the us trade deficit by making american 
goods more expensive and japanese goods cheaper 
the dollar gained against the yen wednesday closing at 14908 
yen in new york compared with 14873 yen on tuesday 
mulford confirmed for reporters that he had attended a g7 
deputies meeting in london on tuesday other sources had said the 
session was with officials at mulfords level and not at the 
ministerial level although treasury secretary nicholas brady was 
also in london tuesday 
while refusing to confirm that stabilizing the japanese yen was 
on the agenda mulford said the group did discuss establishment of 
a european bank for reconstruction and development to help foster 
emerging democracies in eastern europe 
he said he hoped that the bank could begin operating by the end 
of this year but that there was no assurance that this timetable 
could be met 
at wednesdays hearing of a house banking committee task force 
mulford said the g7 countries have been successfully coordinating 
their domestic policies to foster global prosperity 
mulford told the lawmakers he could not make a statement on the 
controversial issue of whether the soviet union should be allowed 
to borrow from the new bank 
were still in the process of learning from what weve 
heard he said 
the bush administration had been reported earlier as opposing 
loans from the bank to the soviet union while other donor 
governments wanted to permit them 
mulford said the administration is anxious to set up special 
standards for loans that are not required by other development 
banks requirements that borrowers move toward democracy 
pluralism free political parties elections the rule of law 
human rights and open marketbased economies 
he said the us government wants to join the bank and its first 
concern is how to finance the transition from communism to 
economies based on markets he suggested that if the bank lends 
chiefly to governments it may promote the existing situation rather 
than contribute to changing it

regardless of whether exxon corp ever goes to 
trial on criminal charges the oil giants indictment in connection 
with its alaska oil spill could cause exxons disasterrelated 
expenses to snowball beyond the 2 billion it already has spent 
experts said wednesday 
dan riesel an environmental attorney with the law firm sive 
paget amp riesel said a number of outcomes are possible in the exxon 
case including an eventual dismissal of the charges 
in the event of a conviction or a plea bargain however 
criminal proceedings against exxon could benefit those who have 
filed civil lawsuits and swell exxons financial burden said 
riesel a former environmental prosecutor for the us attorneys 
office in new york 
if exxon is forced to articulate what it did in a plea bargain 
process it makes life awfully simple for private plaintiffs and 
very difficult for exxon riesel said those are admissions and 
admissions can be used in another proceeding to prove liability 
a federal grand jury in alaska handed up a fivecount criminal 
indictment against exxon on tuesday for counts stemming from the 
oil spill by the tanker exxon valdez after it hit a reef last march 
24 in alaskas prince william sound the spill of 11 million 
gallons of oil soiled over 1000 miles of coastline and killed 
thousands of fish birds and other animals 
more than 160 civil lawsuits are pending against exxon by the 
state of alaska environmentalists and private individuals for 
unspecified damages 
the criminal outcome also could result in fines totaling twice 
the loss to the victim in this case what it cost to restore the 
environment to its condition prior to the spill riesel said 
if measured by the cost of rebuilding the ecosystem then 
were talking an astronomical sum billions he said 
exxon chairman lawrence rawl said tuesday that exxon already has 
spent more than 2 billion in cleanup costs and has paid out more 
than 180 million to 13000 fishermen and other claimants 
the company took 168 billion in charges against 1989 earnings 
to cover what it said was both current and estimated future costs 
for cleanup environmental and legal expenses 
nevertheless tuesdays indictment raised uncertainty about what 
exxons final responsibility would be in the spill 
justice department officials said the indictment could result in 
penalties of 700 million or more but analysts said actual 
financial impact to the oil giant remained too uncertain to 
quantify because exxon failed to reach a settlement over possible 
criminal charges 
exxon reportedly had been negotiating a plea agreement with the 
justice department that would have involved the creation of a 500 
million environmental restoration fund 
i doubt it will cost more than what exxon has already put 
out said joseph v battipaglia equities analyst with gruntal 
investment research he said however its not altogether clear 
to what extent there will be extraordinary expenses arising from 
the indictment 
the absence of a plea bargain only keeps the uncertainty 
said frank p knuettel analyst for prudential bache securities inc 
knuettel and other analysts say the companys enormous size 
insulates it from the financial impact of the spill 
exxon is wealthier than a hundred countries in the un 
said knuettel 
exxons stock dropped 137 to 47 on the new york stock 
exchange in what analysts called a temporary kneejerk 
reaction to the indictment which was announced after the market 
closed tuesday the stock generally was expected to improve in 1990 
battipaglia noted the stock remained above the 45 range in 
which it was trading before the spill exxon stock has been 
relatively flat since the spill 
another uncertainty is the outcome of the trial in alaska of 
joseph hazelwood former captain of the exxon valdez at the time of 
the spill 
hazelwood charged with a felony criminal mischief and three 
misdemeanors is the only person charged criminally in the tanker 
grounding 
analysts said the amount of damages sought in civil lawsuits 
likely would climb if hazelwood is convicted many of the lawsuits 
do not yet specify a damage amount

volkswagen is in a mess in 
the united states but has no plans to pull out of the market the 
head of the west german companys us operations said wednesday 
we are well loved but we are not well purchased said 
william j young vice president of volkswagen united states inc 
we have to act better than our performance we have to become 
leaders again 
the companys share of the us market is about 1 percent its 
dealer network dropped from 840 to 790 outlets last year and it is 
nowhere near achieving its goal of selling 200000 cars in the us 
this year young said 
he said hes pinning volkswagens hopes on fahrvergnugen 
which loosely translates to driving pleasure volkswagen is 
using the word and a stick figure logo in its advertising in an 
attempt to lure curious consumers into showrooms 
in addition to the advertising campaign using the unique word 
volkswagen has broken ranks with its us counterparts and pulled 
out of the incentive wars volkswagen and bmw another west german 
automaker have lowered prices on some of their 1990 model cars 
instead of offering cash rebates or lowinterest financing deals 
the value of rebates is wearing out young said the other 
side of the equation is what do you do if you dont have them 
you do the same thing as when you didnt have them and when 
you didnt have them you had a better business he said 
young took a swipe at the us big three automakers saying they 
dont get involved in longterm planning volkswagen executives he 
said are making longterm plans 
what they are saying is lets develop a longterm strategy so 
we dont put our heads in the sand like some of the manufacturers 
in the us market young said 
youngs comments came during the companys us introduction of 
its passat midsize sedan

harold poling begins a threeyear term as 
chairman of ford motor co on thursday a stint some analysts say 
appears to be a caretaker role while the next chairman is groomed 
for office 
the 64yearold poling who is vice chairman and chief operating 
officer succeeds donald petersen 63 as chairman and chief 
executive 
petersen and poling have worked closely for the past decade 
during which ford changed from a struggling overweight giant that 
lost 15 billion in 1980 to a much leaner company that earned an 
industry record 53 billion eight years later 
the relatively limited time poling will head the company is 
considered unusual by management standards 
its often the case when there has been some kind of trauma 
said edward bowman deputy dean of the university of pennsylvanias 
wharton school the especially unusual thing about it is that 
ford is in especially good shape 
bowman who concentrates his research on chief executive 
positions said the ford board of directors election of poling to 
a limited term as chairman would imply that they werent quite 
ready in terms of succession planning that they werent ready to 
name somebody else for a normal term 
most of the speculation for a longerterm chief executive 
officer in the mid1990s and beyond has centered on allan gilmour 
a ford executive vice president who on thursday adds the title of 
president of the ford automotive group 
petersen joined ford in 1949 and held a variety of positions in 
domestic and international product planning design and marketing 
before he became president polings ford career began in 1951 and 
focused mainly on the financial side of the corporation 
petersen has been credited with freeing designers and engineers 
in the early 1980s to work together in developing the ford taurus 
and mercury sable cars of the mid1980s which helped lift ford 
from the financial doldrums 
i really think that petersen made the necessary adjustments in 
the product plan auto analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co 
of new york the key addition he made was to leave product 
planning to the product planners 
poling would do well to follow that lead brady said 
i think hes got to challenge product planners with the 
charge that this is a very intensely competitive game he said 
thats all hes got to do in the product area 
bowman said i think he poling would be a nut in that 
threeyear period to mess with any product decisions 
poling has his work cut out for him 
the us auto industry is in the depths of a recession that 
began in october companies are wrestling with a way to wean 
american consumers from rebates and other incentives that have 
become ingrained in car buying and are eroding profits 
each of the nations big three automakers general motors corp 
ford and chrysler corp are taking steps to eliminate costs and 
steamline operations with gm and chrysler imposing plant shutdowns 
and layoffs 
brady said poling can leave his mark by raising productivity at 
ford 
if he can follow through with the productivity increase while 
the programs continue in the petersen manner it will be one of the 
best onetwo punches of all time brady said 
poling will become the fourth company chairman who was not a 
member of the ford family the two fords now in company management 
are cousins william c ford jr 32 who heads the companys 
marketing staff and edsel ford ii 41 directors of heavy truck 
engineering and manufacturing both are greatgrandsons of company 
founder henry ford

manipulation case against the chairman of nowdefunct haas 
securities corp were sentenced wednesday to prison terms of one 
and three years 
the sentencings of former haas president stanley aslanian jr 
and henry lorin a stock promoter came one day after haas chairman 
eugene laff was sentenced to five years in prison for manipulating 
the prices of three overthecounter stocks 
lorin 48 who was the president of henlor capital ltd 
received the threeyear prison term from us district judge thomas 
p griesa who said lorin played a key role in the scheme 
aslanian 31 was sentenced to one year in prison and two years 
probation by another federal judge shirley wohl kram kram said 
aslanians cooperation had been meaningful and extensive 
lorin and aslanian who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges 
both testified at laffs trial which ended in december with his 
conviction on five counts of conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and obstruction of justice 
the case against laff stemmed from the governments first fraud 
investigation after the 1987 market crash haas securities a 
brokerage house collapsed nine days after the crash 
the prosecution maintained that the firms scheme to 
artificially raise the prices of penny stocks inexpensive 
securities traded over the counter couldnt be maintained after 
the market dropped and the share prices fell 
laff was convicted of being part of a scheme to artificially 
inflate the penny stock prices by creating a false demand for the 
shares and then selling out his firms own stake before the prices 
collapsed 
the stock involved in the scheme were big o tires inc flores 
de new mexico and ts industries inc 
lorin is to surrender on april 11 and aslanian on march 28

the dollar rose against most major currencies 
wednesday after the government reported the nations economy grew 
at a fasterthanexpected rate in the fourth quarter of 1989 
the dollar traded at an eightmonth high against the japanese 
yen for the third day despite central bank intervention traders 
said continued concern about the tokyo stock market depressed the 
yen 
gold prices were mostly lower republic national bank of new 
york quoted a bid for gold at 40610 a troy ounce as of 4 pm 
est down 215 from late tuesday 
the commerce department said the us economy grew by 09 
percent in 1989s fourth quarter faster than previously estimated 
but still the slowest pace in more than three years 
the revised gnp figure supported the dollar but was not a major 
factor because it is a historic number said hubert pedroli 
foreign exchange manager for credit suisse in new york 
it only gives us a small indication of what we can expect for 
1990 but still its an indication in the sense of sustained

faltered at midday only to soar toward the close after the may 
contracts price broke through resistance at 2110 cents a pound 
the rally appeared to be inspired more by chart signals than 
supplyanddemand factors although analysts linked some of the 
buying to taiwans overnight purchase of 23000 metric tons of 
soybeans talk of iraqi interest in us soybean meal and 
perceptions that soybeancrushing activity is slowing 
after the close the usda announced a sale of 23000 metric tons 
of soybean oil to pakistan 
analyst walter spilka of smith barney harris upham amp co 
attributed most of the increased demand for soybean oil to domestic 
users including food processors in the wake of research linking 
imported alternatives such as palm oil and coconut oil to higher 
blood cholesterol levels 
last year we had a lot of imports of tropical oils but a lot 
of bakers have now stopped using tropical oils spilka said 
anne frick senior oilseeds analysts with prudentialbache

the soybean markets failure to fall during february below its 
january lows defying a wellknown seasonal pattern 
that didnt happen this year and i think it gave the bulls

robert e lee is plotting an offensive this 
spring in tennessee but instead of leading a fight between 
confederate and union troops lees battle involves spirits 
bob lee iv greatgrandson of the civil war general is in the 
liquor business 
as chairman of the tiny privately owned a smith bowman inc 
distillery lee is taking on a much bigger foe on the oppositions 
home turf tennesseebased jack daniel in a bid to double sales 
of bowmans virginia gentleman bourbon in that state 
lee 65 has a military leaders reluctance to tell too much 
exactly what is meant by double sales he wont say 
but he admits his company isnt setting out to become an 
industry giant we dont need a lot of sales to show an increase 
because were not going against a million cases he said 
in virginia however lees company is as big as his familys 
name 
we are the no 1 alcoholic beverage label in the state he 
said 
that ranking was achieved largely because of bowmans virginia 
vodka which sells about 150000 cases a year in the state bowman 
also has just gone international with an order from poland for 
50000 cases of vodka the largest single order for one product in 
the companys history 
bowmans mainstay virginia gentleman bourbon is no 2 in the 
state behind national leader jim beam virginia gentleman also is 
sold in seven other states from pennsylvania to north carolina and 
a pocket in atlanta 
two years ago bowman introduced its own gin which now accounts 
for about 12000 cases a year 
lee is a born salesman whose accent reflects his new york roots 
his father was a columbia universityeducated doctor who practiced 
in the city 
but lee was sent to private school in virginia and in 1949 
graduated washington amp lee university in lexington where his 
greatgrandfather served as president after the civil war 
after college he moved to the west coast and became an 
advertising executive for the san francisco chronicle twenty years 
ago lee joined bowman when his brotherinlaw a smith bowman 
jr asked him to take over sales and marketing duties at the 
company founded in 1935 by bowmans father a smith bowman sr 
i basically like sales said lee whose first decision at 
bowman was to hire a public relations executive and begin traveling 
around the state to give civic club speeches and newspaper and 
television interviews to promote virginia gentleman 
i went down to lynchburg one time and was on a cooking show 
he said id never cooked in my life but we did it for half an 
hour and gave away recipes it was fun 
lee who eventually succeeded the bowmans as chairman of the 
nations oldest familyowned independent bourbon distillery also 
played a role in the decision to diversify the firms products 
here we had one product bourbon he said nationally 
bourbon was not going anywhere 
bourbons share of the liquor market dwindled from 14 percent in 
1978 to 108 percent in 1988 but the trend was evident early on 
and bowman got into the vodka business in 1982 lee said 
when the companys vodka went on the market it got a boost from 
thengov charles s robb who launched his we have it made in 
virginia campaign at the same time that was pure luck lee 
said 
the companys gin came out two years ago while lee has been 
searching for new directions to take the company bowman is not 
ready to become a major national player in the liquor field he 
said 
although sales of bourbon are slumping nationally lee said 
there are still plenty of bourbon drinkers to woo away from 
competitors 
a dozen years ago bowman entered into a partnership with a 
wholesaler in florida and texas and attempted for 18 months to sell 
virginia gentleman in those two states it just didnt work 
lee said 
so having done that we realize we cant go big league like 
jim beam he said we never would have known if we hadnt 
tried 
lee keeps a small bust of gen lee in his office but most of 
the family decorations are related to his children including son 
robert e lee v who teaches at a nearby private school 
lee said people always want to hear stories about his 
greatgrandfather 
but we dont have any special anecdotes in the family about 
general lee he said one of the major reasons is that 
everybody got married late in life my father never knew his 
grandfather and my father was in his 50s when i was born 
we had a sense of history but we didnt have anybody sitting 
in someones lap telling about something that wasnt in dr 
freemans or bruce cattons books lee said of the pulitzer 
prizewinning biography of his greatgrandfather by douglas 
southall freeman and works by civil war historian catton thats 
just the way it was 
what lee has in mind for the tennessee offensive is a taste 
test a battle of the bourbons its going to be kentucky vs 
tennessee vs virginia he said 
how far is he willing to go to win 
a southern gentleman will go to any lengths to maintain the 
family honor according to a bowman brochure a virginia 
gentleman will go only to honorable lengths

the union representing greyhound lines inc bus 
drivers offered little hope wednesday that a friday strike could be 
averted although lowlevel talks with management continued 
there has been progress in some areas but very little 
progress in others said edward m strait president of the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions it will be very 
difficult to achieve our objective a fair and equitable contract 
by the march 2 deadline 
a union spokesman declined to say where progress had been made 
and which issues remained unresolved 
the union which represents 6300 bus drivers and 3075 of the 
companys office and maintenance workers has called a strike for 
1201 am friday one minute after the current threeyear contract 
expires 
dallasbased greyhound which operates the only nationwide 
intercity bus system has said it will continue to run a limited 
schedule if the drivers strike with plans to build back to full 
operations by the end of march 
full scale negotiations between the two sides ended last week 
although lowlevel meetings resumed over the weekend in scottsdale 
ariz strait said the current talks were moving at a slow pace 
in a statement greyhound executive vice president p anthony 
lannie said the unions demand were far above the average of 
companyunion negotiated settlements of the last two years 
greyhound officials declined to comment on the unions remarks 
citing an ongoing news blackout covering the talks 
the company has said it cannot afford more than the 63 million 
threeyear pact it is offering greyhound estimates the unions 
proposal would cost 406 million over the life of the contract 
greyhound says it earned about 730000 on about 1 billion in 
revenue last year the first profit since the company was formed in 
1987 through the 350 million purchases of greyhound and trailways 
lines inc 
prior to the buyout the union agreed to a 22 percent wage cut 
and the company has said the current offer is an attempt to regain 
that money before the company is able to pay 
those people that you owe or will owe money to dont 
acknowledge that your pay has been cut by 25 percent said union 
spokesman jeffrey nelson its a difficult situation 
although the negotiations are the first since currey purchased 
the company greyhound went through two acrimonious strikes while 
still a subsidiary of phoenixbased greyhound corp 
a 1983 strike lasted 48 days and was an extremely difficult 
strike nelson said there also was a fourday strike in 1974 
these people know what its like to go on strike he said

fisherprice said wednesday it would 
close a toy manufacturing plant in the town where the company was 
founded 60 years ago and lay off 450 employees 
fisherprice executive vice president david b fisher said the 
layoffs would begin may 15 and the east aurora plant should be 
closed by july 1 
this decision will lower our costs and improve our position in 
this very competitive market place fisher said 
fisherprice the worlds largest maker of infant and preschool 
toys and juvenile products said it would keep its corporate 
headquarters in this village outside buffalo and plants in medina 
and holland also in upstate new york 
high inventories production delays higher costs and supply 
problems over the last year have hampered fisherprice which 
posted a 95 million operating loss in the final quarter of 1989 
fisher said he expects the company to be marginally profitable 
at best in 1990 
overall sales were 800 million in 1989 and fisherprice still 
has an excellent reputation among its customers a recent national 
survey of buyer attitudes on product quality rated fisherprice 
toys third behind mercedes benz autos and eastmankodak photo 
products 
reports over the last week have indicated that fisherprice 
would be sold by parent quaker oats co of chicago but quaker 
chairman william d smithburg said last week that fisherprice was 
not now on the block 
about 1000 people work at corporate headquarters and 2000 more 
at the other plants fisherprice employs about 10000 people 
worldwide 
none of those laid off who are semiskilled workers making 8 
to 9 an hour will be offered jobs at other fisherprice 
operations 
the east aurora plant which began operation in 1951 makes 
fisherprices little people playsets bubble mower and magic vac 
those operations will be transferred to the medina plant and a 
plant in murray ky 
fisher said the east aurora plant is the least efficient the 
company owns because it does not have fabrication assembly and 
plastic molding capability in one building

innovations expected to propel the manufacturing 
industry into the future including video headsets and floating 
concrete are on display at the national design engineering show 
and conference 
about 25000 engineers are expected to converge on chicagos 
lakefront mccormick place through thursday to see new designs from 
companies such as dow chemical co and minnesota mining amp 
manufacturing co even nasa 
many of the products and materials on display represent minor 
advances a fiber that resists fading just a bit longer for 
example nevertheless consumers will feel the effect of the new 
technology 
you and i ultimately in some way will be related or involved 
with every single product in this show whether its paint on an 
automobile or the spring in the seat or the knobs to turn on your 
hifi said robert rosaler director of an engineering conference 
sponsored by the american society of mechanical engineers in 
conjunction with the show 
some new products debuting at the show take a broader step into 
the future 
for example a massachusetts company is showing a miniature 
video display monitor slightly larger than a lipstick through the 
use of a magnifying lens the oneinch display window produces an 
image that looks as though it is on a 12inch screen 
this is basically the walkman of the future its a 
videoman said raymond hoffer a representative of reflection 
technology of waltham mass 
by christmas the mini video monitor is due to appear in stores 
as a component in a 5by2 inch paperless pocket fax machine said 
neil golden director of sales for reflection technology 
the 2ounce terminal can display 25 lines of 80 characters each 
on a redandblack screen it can attach to a headband that 
positions the video screen a few inches in front of the eyes 
allowing a person to look up information while leaving the hands 
free to work 
at least eight other companies plan to use reflection 
technologys monitor in products including a 5by3 portable 
computer and a patient monitor that doctors can wear in the 
operating room golden said 
nasa is at the show to make the us engineering and 
scientific community aware that there is nasa technology available 
that they may use said walter heiland manager of the agencys 
technology utilization office 
the space agency has a history of spinning off its technological 
advances 
for example nasas need in the 1960s for a tool that apollo 
astronauts could use to scoop up moon rocks resulted in handheld 
cordless vacuum cleaners that eventually reached consumers more 
recently a version of a pump developed for the viking mars lander 
has been implanted in people to deliver medicine such as insulin 
3m is showcasing a lightweight concrete subsitute called 
macrolite that weighs about a third as much as the real thing 
to illustrate 3m representatives filled a tub with water and 
put in two concrete logs one sinks the other made of the 
substitute floats 
developed by 3m in 1986 the lightweight concrete can be used 
for building in earthquakeprone areas 
you can build the same highrise buildings only much lighter 
so when they sway they dont topple over said william whitcomb 
a company representative 
3m says the ceramic substance pumped with air is a better 
insulator than concrete an 8inch wall of macrolite provides the 
insulating power of 65 inches of concrete whitcomb said 
dow plastics a division of midland michbased dow is on hand 
with a product it has no intention of producing a plastic 
elliptical lawnmower that cuts a swath about a foot wider than 
traditional push mowers 
plastic allows a bigger machine that is no tougher to push than 
steel and aluminum models said mower designer robert cleereman 
the idea is to show commercial engineers that plastics 
particularly dow plastics can be used in place of metals and 
woods said cleereman who also is director of dows materials 
engineering center 
heres an example where plastics not only do it as well they 
do it better he said

a leading credit rating agency warned 
wednesay that harcourt brace jovanovich inc may have to sell more 
assets to meet payments coming due in late 1992 on its 16 billion 
debt 
the warning from moodys investors service inc came as harcourt 
reported that a big gain on the sale of its theme parks helped the 
publishing and insurance concern earn 3166 million in the fourth 
quarter compared with a loss of 539 million during same period a 
year ago 
moodys said that despite the sale of the theme parks and 
subsequent repayment of bank debt harcourts cash flow from its 
publishing and insurance properties will provide only narrow 
coverage of anticipated cash interest charges and capital 
expenditures over the near term 
as a result moodys also lowered its ratings on harcourts debt 
the ratings agency said that the requirement that harcourt must 
pay cash interest and dividends in late 1992 and 1993 is likely 
to necessitate further asset sales andor debt restructuring 
it downgraded harcourts senior debt rating to b3 from b1 and 
ratings on other grades of debt were also reduced the companys 
debt had been assigned a speculative grade before the action and 
the reductions indicate the agency feels chances for timely debt 
repayment have grown riskier 
the debt rating is one of the factors that are considered in 
valuing a companys securities and a ratings reduction often 
causes a decline in the market price of a companys bonds 
two calls were placed to harcourt for comment on moodys action 
but they were not immediately returned 
harcourt amassed a huge debt nearly three years ago when it 
underwent a massive restructuring in an effort to avoid a hostile 
takeover by british publisher robert maxwell 
in the fourth quarter harcourt said its earnings per share 
amounted to 422 in contrast to a loss of 108 per share a year 
earlier 
fourthquarter revenue slipped 07 percent to 3017 million 
from 3038 million a year earlier 
the company closed the sale of its six theme parks to 
anheuserbusch cos for 11 billion in the quarter it reported a 
gain on disposal of assets of 309 million in the quarter 
it reported net income from continuing operations of 195 
million for the quarter in contrast to a loss from continuing 
operations of 547 million 
for the year harcourt said it earned 721 million or 17 cents 
a share in contrast to a loss of 534 million or 203 a share 
a year earlier 
revenue for the year rose 55 percent to 134 billion from 
127 billion a year earlier 
the company said it recorded a charge of 176 million in the 
third quarter including a 95 million writeoff in its publishing 
business 
in explaining the debt ratings reduction moodys boted that 
repayment of the companys bank debt with proceeds from the theme 
parks sale had reduced harcourts interest costs substantially 
it said the company should have enough cash flow to service its 
cash interest charges and capital spending over the near term 
because of the deferred cash payment features of some of its debt 
instruments 
but moodys added it is uncertain that the company will be 
able to achieve the growth necessary to service its debt and 
preferred stock once all fixed charges are payable in cash 
the agency noted that the market value of assets can change and 
said the aftertax proceeds from sale of harcourt assets at a 
given point in time may not be sufficient to cover both debt and 
preferred securities

a senate committee approved legislation 
wednesday aimed at providing greater protection of pension payments 
when companies terminate retirement plans to capture their surplus 
assets 
the legislation by sens howard metzenbaum dohio and nancy 
kassebaum rkan would impose new standards on pension fund 
administrators in deciding whether to terminate retirement plans 
this bill will stop employers from using their workers 
pension plans as corporate piggybanks metzenbaum said in a 
statement after the senate labor and human resources committee 
approved the bill on a 115 vote 
kassebaum and sen james jeffords rvt joined with the 
panels democratic majority in voting to send the bill to the floor 
surplus pension assets have become a popular target for 
corporate raiders who acquire a company and quickly end socalled 
defined benefit retirement programs to take any excess cash 
defined benefit programs are administered by trustees or the 
employer and promise a certain benefit on retirement socalled 
defined contribution plans where the company contributes to an 
employees account generally are not at issue because the employe 
owns the funds and there is no surplus cash when it comes time to 
retire the money is turned over the employee or buys an annuity 
in general the legislation would allow a company to strip out 
surplus pension assets only if is determined to be in the best 
interests of workers and retirees 
the bill requires the company to consider specific issues in 
making that determination including whether costofliving 
benefits would be provided to retirees and whether an adequate 
financial cushion can be maintained in any replacement retirement 
plan 
metzenbaum has maintained that at least a portion of surplus 
pension assets should be set aside for costofliving adjustments 
in retirement benefits the legislation does not require colas but 
makes it more likely they would be provided according to 
supporters of the measure 
the pension benefit guaranty corp must approve pension fund 
terminations however critics complain that existing law doesnt 
adequately take into account whether pension beneficiaries will be 
better or worse off if a corporation takes back excess money from 
retirement plans 
workers who have been promised pensions should be assured 
those promises will be fulfilled and that their interests will take 
first place in these situations kassebaum said 
excess cash can arise in definedbenefit plans in several ways 
one common way is the upward revision of estimates of what plan 
assets can earn the higher the estimates the less cash is needed 
now to meet future obligations

a federal appeals board on wednesday rejected 
mcis attempt to challenge part of the multibilliondollar 
telephone contracts the government awarded to atampt and us sprint 
at issue were changes to one of the two contracts to redesign 
and provide a pair of voice data and video telecommunications 
networks in the 1990s for the government a project that could 
total 25 billion over 10 years 
in december 1988 the general services administration awarded 
the contract for one network to american telephone amp telegraph co 
and the other to us sprint losing out was a third bidder martin 
marietta corp whose proposal included a substantial share for mci 
telecommunications corp 
wednesdays ruling by the gsa board of contract appeals involved 
a dispute over changes the gsa is permitting us sprint to make in 
tollfree services 
mci had complained the modification was outside the scope of the 
contract and that competition was necessary to satisfy the 
requirement reflected in the changes 
but the board noting that the modification did not alter the 
maximum value of the contract rejected the appeal 
the government is modernizing its telecommunications system to 
incorporate technological advancements which permit greater 
flexibility the board said the modifications represent 
improvements to tollfree service 
mci spokesman john houser said the company would continue to 
litigate changes to contracts it considers outside the scope of 
contracts 
we werent totally surprised but were disappointed we kind 
of saw the writing on the wall on this one but we thought wed 
make a point which is that they should take a hard look at these 
so the interest of competition and the taxpayers is best served 
houser said 
last year the board rejected an mci challenge to the atampt award 
and a federal appeals court later upheld the ruling the fcc also 
had rejected mci charges that atampt set prices below costs in 
bidding for the contract

union carbide corp the multinational 
chemical company that analysts speculated had been contemplating 
restructuring announced wednesday that it would not take that 
route 
taking into account all the revelant factors we believe 
that carbide should at this time continue on its present course 
under its present structure chairman robert d kennedy said in a 
statement 
analysts had speculated for some time that the company would 
restructure to make it better able to fend off any takeover 
attempt the company plunged deeply in debt while fending off a 
hostile takeover in 1986 
kennedy said carbide had studied several restructuring 
possibilities but nixed them because they were not beneficial to 
the company or its shareholders 
our criteria have been enhancement of both shareholder value 
and the strengthening of our core business kennedy said at 
this time there is no restructuring alternative that meets both 
criteria 
carbide stock which soared last week amid rumors of a possible 
takeover or spinoff closed 50 cents higher wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange at 2425 
union carbide realigned in 1988 forming a holding corporation 
with three subsidiaries analysts had speculated the move could 
have been a prelude to spinning off one of subsidiaries to raise 
capital 
the three subsidiaries are union carbide chemicals and plastics 
company inc union carbide industrial gases inc and ucar carbon 
company inc 
david kernis a spokesman for union carbide said the strategy 
aimed to maximize development by decentralizing the company 
kennedy said the company plans to continue along that course but 
would not rule out other options such as acquisitions joint 
ventures and strategic alliances 
kernis refused to say what restructuring options the company 
considered kennedy could not be reached for comment wednesday 
night 
carbide earned 573 million last year down 13 percent from 
record profits of 662 million in 1988 sales dipped to 832 
billion last year from 874 billion in 1988

the walt disney co scoured hollywood on 
wednesday for the source of a bogus news release that claimed 
moonwalking megastar michael jackson had signed a fiveyear movie 
deal with disney 
disney said it began an investigation to find the author of the 
release used as the basis for a story in a trade publication 
among other things the story said jackson was negotiating to leave 
cbs records for disneys new hollywood records and would design 
theme park rides for disney 
we fully intend to take action against the person or persons 
responsible walt disney studios chairman jeffrey katzenberg said 
in a news release this company has a reputation for protecting 
its name and taking legal action when necessary 
the bogus information was included in a frontpage article 
wednesday in the hollywood reporter which focused on a stock deal 
planned by jacksons father the paper ran a frontpage article 
wednesday saying it had been the victim of a hoax 
editor teri ritzer said the writer who handled the story had 
been disciplined she declined to say whether he had been fired 
disney said the news release typed on company stationery was 
sent to several publications spokesman ed pine said it appeared to 
have been motivated by a personal vendetta against a disney 
employee and said the hoaxer hadnt been found but refused to 
discuss the matter further 
separately ed shaw a spokesman for the newly formed jackson 
records set up by michael jacksons father joe jackson said the 
elder jackson had held preliminary talks with several wall street 
brokerages about a possible stock offering for as much as 100 
million 
joe jackson who steered his children to stardom as the jackson 
five but no longer handles the affairs of michael or janet jackson 
wants to use the proceeds of the stock offering chiefly to fund 
movies starring michael and janet shaw said 
however michael jacksons lawyer john branca said neither he 
nor his client knew anything about the planned offering 
and shaw acknowledged that neither michael jackson nor his 
sister had agreed to make records or movies for joe jacksons 
company 
i dont think that any of the wall street firms would be 
interested without the participation of the two megastars he 
said 
the initial hollywood reporter story included a description of a 
movie that jackson supposedly would make with the troika of steven 
spielberg george lucas and francis ford coppola the outerspace 
musical tentatively titled project m was said to be budgeted 
between 50 million and 60 million 
jackson stars in the 3d movie captain eo at disneyland 
which opened in 1986 and was produced by lucas coppola and jackson

chrysler corp said its ready to sell its 1 
billion stillunfinished technical center and then lease it back 
gaining 800 million in badly needed cash along the way 
the move announced tuesday is seen as a way for the financially 
struggling no 3 automaker to raise the money it needs to finance a 
costcutting program that includes thousands of whitecollar early 
retirements 
it looks to me like the smartest way to do it at the moment 
said auto analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co in new york 
chrysler on monday filed papers with the securities and exchange 
commission in washington seeking permission to sell and lease back 
its chrysler technology center in auburn hills about 25 miles 
north of detroit 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said tuesday the company would 
sell the center to the auburn hills trust which in turn would 
offer certificates to raise 800 million for chrysler 
the trust then would lease the center to the auburn hills trust 
services property management company which would collect lease 
payments from chrysler to repay the 800 million by 2020 
there are two basic advantages houston said we can raise 
more money than we could with a conventional mortgage and we get 
800 million for use by the company thats not tied up in the 
center 
the money he said will go into chryslers general operating 
coffers 
the salelease arrangement is the latest in a series of moves 
chrysler has made to get rid of nonautomotive businesses and raise 
cash 
last september chrysler sold nearly half of its stake in 
mitsubishi motors corp of japan and made about 310 million after 
taxes earlier this month it sold its gulfstream aerospace corp 
subsidiary for 825 million 
the company has been waging a costcutting program to chisel 
about 15 billion from its 26 billion annual budget by the end of 
the year 
that program includes trimming more than 10 percent of the 
whitecollar work force through attrition or early retirement 
which costs money 
chrysler reported that it lost 664 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 including 577 million in writeoffs for two car 
assembly plants the company is closing this year it was the 
automakers first quarterly loss since 1982 
chrysler and state government officials broke ground for the 
25millionsquarefoot complex in october 1986 it originally was 
targeted to be completed this year and house 5000 employees 
houston said the completion date now is 1993 and the center will 
house 7000 workers most of whom now work at the companys 
highland park headquarters

seabrook nuclear power plant proponents 
and opponents rarely agree but both say the regulatory process 
leading up to thursdays expected licensing of the plant 14 years 
after groundbreaking has been ridiculous 
both sides expect the nuclear regulatory commission to license 
the 65 billion plant owned by a dozen utilities but opponents 
promised legal action to keep it idle 
i never thought it would take this long said former gov 
meldrim thomson a seabrook supporter who served during 197379 
if any human being could dream up anything worse they would 
have to work at it thomson said weve been told over and over 
again that weve built the best and safest plant thats ever been 
built its ridiculous that it hasnt been licensed 
veteran antiseabrook protester paul gunter first arrested at 
the plant in 1976 is equally critical but from the opposite 
viewpoint 
the regulatory process has been in the hands of a promotional 
agency rather than a regulatory agency he said the nrc has 
basically pulled seabrook into operation even though it cant meet 
the law and protect human safety 
dianne dunfey another veteran protester was released from jail 
last week after serving a fiveday term for refusing to pay a fine 
following a sitin at gov judd greggs office she called the nrc 
one of the most disreputable of all government agencies 
it has ignored public input said dunfey who teaches in 
seabrook it either discarded or amended all of its own 
regulations anytime seabrook couldnt meet one 
asked why the licensing procedure had taken as long as it did 
nrc spokesman john kopeck in washington said there was a legal 
process that it had to go through there were a lot of steps that 
had to be taken 
if promised court appeals dont succeed seabrook would go 
through a threemonth buildup to fullpower operation 
the main point in the way of licensing was the federal 
requirement for evacuation plans for communities within 10 miles of 
the plant including six in massachusetts 
opponents say the area surrounding the plant about two miles 
from popular hampton beach and 40 miles north of boston is too 
densely populated to be evacuated safely in an emergency 
the regulatory process at the nrc is largely a charade sen 
gordon humphrey rnh said in a telephone interview wednesday 
they have brushed aside concerns about evacuation anybody whos 
been in a traffic jam near the plant during the summer knows that 
in a panic situation evacuation would be impossible 
seabrook proponents including former gov john sununu now 
white house chief of staff say the plans will work sununu 
declined to comment on the plant this week but as governor he was 
a vocal supporter 
it may be a surprise but we run the analogy of an 
evacuation experiment 730 each summer day sununu said during 
a 1983 debate at 730 that beach is crowded and at 11 at 
night that beach is empty 
while environmental groups and the massachusetts attorney 
general fought the evacuation plans the grassroots clamshell 
alliance staged antiseabrook demonstrations that made the plant a 
national focus of the antinuclear movement in the 1970s and 80s 
the last major seabrook demonstration was in october when 475 
people were arrested after scaling the fences 
a few opponents began vigils tuesday at the statehouse and 
outside seabrook a larger demonstration was to follow the 
licensing vote 
seabrooks path toward licensing has been a rocky one 
seabrooks lead owner public service co of new hampshire filed 
for a permit to build twin 1150megawatt reactors in 1973 the 
first was to operate commercially in 1979 the second in 1981 
total cost was estimated at 973 million 
the nrc approved the permit in 1976 but it was suspended three 
times in the late 1970s in disputes over radioactive waste and 
tunnels for cooling water 
the first reactor was finished in the mid1986 at a cost of 43 
billion the second 25 percent complete was scrapped that year 
since then financing and operating costs have boosted the cost by 
50 million a month bringing the total by thursday to 65 billion 
public service filed for bankruptcy in january 1988 under the 
burden of its seabrook debt

the former parent of imperial savings 
association sought bankruptcy protection just days after the thrift 
was seized by federal regulators who said it was 601 million in 
the red 
the government took control of imperial savings last week in 
large part because of problems brought about by its large portfolio 
of junk bonds 
imperial had invested more than 97 billion of its assets in 
junk bonds junk bond prices have plummetted in recent months and 
thrifts must divest their holdings by 1994 under provisions of last 
years savings and loan bailout legislation 
only columbia savings and loan in beverly hills has a bigger 
portfolio of the highyield highrisk bonds among thrifts 
imperials former parent imperial corp of america said 
wednesday it had filed for chapter 11 protection in bankruptcy 
court in san diego to protect its other subsidiaries 
the filing will give it breathing room to come up with a 
reorganization plan without having to worry about creditors 
lawsuits 
this was a very difficult decision said ica chief executive 
lyman hamilton however in an effort to protect our bondholders 
shareholders and continue our operating businesses we believe this 
was a prudent thing to do 
imperial corp and its former savings and loan subsidiary 
effectively split friday when the thrift was taken over by the 
resolution trust corp the federal agency that manages seized 
thrifts accounts up to 100000 are federally insured 
todays filing by imperial corp in now way affects imperial 
savings or its depositors savings because the two are now 
independent companies imperial savings spokesman kenn ulrich 
said 
imperial corp will be forwarding documentation of its assets 
and liabilities to the court over the next few weeks said patrick 
shea a lawyer for the firm representing the corporation in the 
proceedings 
ulrich said he didnt know what imperial corps other 
subsidiaries were and didnt have any of its financial data 
available because he started his job just two weeks ago

the union representing workers at nordstrom inc 
filed a classaction lawsuit wednesday accusing the clothing 
retailer of widespread violations of wage and hour laws 
the suit was the second to be filed against the upscale clothier 
in as many days 
on tuesday a us district court suit was filed here by three 
nordstrom shareholders who alleged they and other stockholders had 
suffered financial losses because company officials failed to 
disclose labor problems at the chain 
united food amp commercial workers union locals 1001 and 367 and 
five current and former nordstrom employees filed their suit in 
king county superior court the suit includes in its class 
approximately 50000 current and former nordstrom workers in 
washington oregon california virginia utah and alaska 
the two locals represent about 1500 nordstrom workers in the 
seattle area nationally nordstrom has about 60 stores and employs 
about 30000 
on feb 15 the washington department of labor and industries 
ruled nordstrom had violated state laws by failing to pay some 
employees for time worked outside normal working hours 
the state acting on a complaint filed by the ufcw found that 
workers had not been properly compensated for such things as 
attending meetings delivering merchandise to other stores and 
customers doing inventory work or writing thankyou notes to 
customers 
nordstrom said monday it had made a 15 million provision for 
expected back pay claims by employees and adopted a procedure to 
handle the claims the charge against fourthquarter earnings was 
cited by the company as one reason why profits fell 34 percent in 
the period ending jan 31 
joe peterson local 1001 president in seattle said at the time 
that the 15 million was far too little and threatened to sue if 
nordstrom officials failed to negotiate a backpay settlement with 
the union union officials have said claims could exceed 200 
million in california alone 
nordstrom said claims forms had been sent to sales clerks in 
states other than washington in washington state those forms must 
be reviewed by the states labor office and by the two union locals 
labor and industries spokeswoman karen jones said wednesday that 
the review had not yet taken place and james webster attorney for 
local 1001 said they have not come to us to discuss that plan 
as they said they would in the papers 
webster said the union had hoped for a settlement from the 
outset and was still willing to meet with company officials 
the union lawsuit repeats the allegations made in the state 
complaint and alleges other violations of washington and california 
labor laws including that washington employees were required to 
buy clothes from nordstrom to wear at work 
in a news release nordstrom cochairman john nordstrom said the 
company regretted the lawsuit saying that once it was filed 
local court rules place restrictions on our ability to 
communicate directly with our employees about their claims this 
could slow down and perhaps bring to a halt the resolution 
process 
nordstrom said the company will continue trying to compensate 
for back claims including seeking court approval to do so 
the suit asks the court to order nordstrom to keep proper 
employment records and award damages equal to twice the amount of 
wages unpaid other damages to be determined at trial and 
attorneys fees 
the union has said claims in washington state may total 30 
million to 40 million and run as high as 200 million in 
california it had no estimate on likely claims in other states 
to date the union has received about 520 claims from workers 
worth about 25 million
