gov cecil andrus declared a state of 
extreme emergency friday putting military reinforcements on call 
to help the battle against hundreds of forest fires burning out of 
control 
the emergency proclamation which allows the state to use the 
national guard will last for 30 days or until the fire danger 
subsides the boise interagency fire center estimated about 3000 
people were working as firefighters or support personnel to battle 
15000 acres of idaho fires 
the weather cooperated in northern idaho with high humidity that 
slowed the flames while the opposite was true for the boise 
national forest 
the humidity dropped considerably said lynette davis boise 
forest spokeswoman when the air dried out the fires got up and 
ran 
a lightning storm earlier this week covered central idaho with 
500 fires some limited to just a burning tree firefighters 
concentrated on the larger blazes while parachuting smokejumpers 
or helicopterborne crews tackled the small ones 
the containment of small fires and shuffling of crews friday 
left it difficult to assess total acreage burned or manpower on the 
fire lines 
the toppriority fire in the state was the 1500acre fleming 
creek blaze near banks north of boise said pam gardner fire 
information officer for the payette forest north of boise it 
burned on state and boise forest land 
the second fire of concern was the 600acre dollar creek fire 
near the south fork of the salmon river east of cascade because of 
the chance its destruction of ground cover could lead to erosion 
into the river 
fire bosses in the boise bureau of land management district 
focused on the 6500acre deer creek blaze near mann creek north of 
weiser which had tripled in size since thursday and was burning in 
critical sharptail grouse habitat 
in the payette national forest about 500 firefighters from all 
over the west had contained 70 of 130 fires and the federal 
aviation administration erected a temporary tower at the mccall 
airport to monitor the scores of retardant bombers and smoke jumper 
planes in the region

a federal judge ruled friday that 
polygamist clan leader addam swapp can appeal his conviction for 
the bombing of a mormon chapel despite his attorneys failure to 
meet a filing deadline 
us district judge bruce jenkins gave defense attorney john 
bucher an extension for excusable neglect in filing the appeal 
in the 10th circuit court of appeals a few days late last summer 
meanwhile federal prosectors said they will appeal jenkins 
sentencing of swapp and two of his three codefendants in the jan 
16 1988 bombing and a subsequent standoff with authorities that 
ended in a fatal shootout 
the violence at the clans compound ended a standoff with state 
and federal officials corrections lt fred house was killed and 
swapp was wounded in the exchange the impasse had begun 13 days 
earlier when swapp bombed a mormon chapel near the farm 
bucher filed the appeal after jenkins sentenced the four last 
july but the denver appellate court returned the matter to jenkins 
so he could make a ruling on the late filing 
swapp his brother jonathan his motherinlaw vickie singer and 
her son john timothy singer were convicted of 20 counts of 
bombing attempted murder and use of firearms 
jenkins defying federal mandatory sentencing guidelines 
governing bombings and firearms which are much stiffer originally 
sentenced swapp to 15 years in prison mrs singer to five years 
and jonathan swapp and singer to 10 years each 
prosecutors however appealed the sentences and the 10th 
circuit returned the case to jenkins who added token additions to 
the terms of the swapp brothers and mrs singer he added no time 
to singers term 
assistant us attorney richard lambert said the new appeal 
would ask for fiveyear firearm enhancement terms for singer 
and the swapps but no additional time for mrs singer 47 who has 
dropped her own appeal 
the swapp brothers and singer also were convicted of state 
homicide charges in houses death

its nearly dinner time the baby is crying and 
mister rogers comes on in five minutes whats a parent to do 
two seattle entrepreneurs hope the answer is the totsized tv 
dinner pop it in the microwave and presto cod with creamed peas 
and squash 
babies love it and so do grownups it tastes like real 
food said linda dootson pigott vice president of the starting 
right co and the mother of a 7yearold 
she and company president cameon ivarsson said the idea behind 
the frozen dinners is to start toddlers at 4 months with a balanced 
and nutritional diet without exhausting their mothers in the 
process 
the frozen minimeals are being produced and packaged in a 
seattle specialtyfood factory while the entrepreneurs await 
specially adapted machinery 
the meals being testmarketed in seattlearea groceries 
contain items from the pacific northwest ranging from cod to 
vegetables the only additive is a little water for consistency 
ms pigott said 
the company is starting with four menus in three textures from 
smooth to chunky with offerings such as semolina pasta and brown 
rice ms pigott said there is also a vegetarian menu 
each bowl has a cartoon beneath the food to help encourage kids 
to finish the food so they can see the picture in each tub the 
foods are separate to allow mothers to introduce each item 
separately to the child 
its exactly as if a mom made her own baby food were not 
doing weird things were doing plain simple things said ms 
ivarsson a swisstrained neurophysiologist 
in switzerland she fed two boys now 5 and 8 her homemade baby 
food she spent every other weekend cooking and freezing 40 minitv 
dinners 
when she moved to the united states and gave birth to margaux 
now 15 months old ms ivarsson decided to do what every american 
mother does and bought a jar of commercial baby food 
the strained carrots she said were flavorless margaux wasnt 
enthusiastic about the food either she said 
so ms ivarsson formed starting right with ms pigott who has 
a degree in finance and once owned and operated a restaurant 
doctor friends gave advice about nutrition and ms ivarssons 
husband who runs a restaurant helped with business tips 
if the frozen dinners catch on the company plans to incorporate 
regional foods depending on where the meals are distributed so 
babies start out eating foods theyll be served as they grow up 
suggested retail prices range from about 135 to 149 
ms pigot and ms ivarsson said theyre trying to help women who 
get involved in the business the board members are women and the 
majority of the company stockholders are women 
i dont know if youd call it feminist but our philosophy was 
that if we have the opportunity to help women good ms pigott 
said 
the company faces tough competition from other baby food 
manufacturers particularly the fremont michbased gerber product 
co which controls 70 percent of the baby food market said gerber 
spokeswoman barbara ivens 
gerbers baby foods have no additives except water for making 
puree ms ivens said only the desserts have sugar added and some 
of the fruits have added vitamin c she said

a man was found guilty of firstdegree murder 
friday in the killing of a church volunteer more than two years 
after he was captured in the longest manhunt in missouri history 
the jury deliberated for 2 hours before returning the verdict 
against john david brown 35 in phelps county circuit court 
the penalty phase of the twoweek trial is scheduled to begin at 
930 am saturday and the state is asking for the death penalty 
the jury can recommend either death or life imprisonment 
tim finnical an assistant attorney general and the lead 
prosecutor in the case said testimony from ballistics experts 
showed the gun brown had when he was arrested in ada okla was 
the one that killed caretaker claude long in a doolittle church on 
april 1 1987 
circumstantial evidence conclusively conclusively proves 
john david brown murdered this man finnical told the jury 
browns attorney brad kessler had questioned the validity of 
the ballistics results what you have here is the state grasping 
at straws they have to put someone in the church kessler said 
at the time long was killed brown was the subject of a massive 
manhunt after a man matching his description fled from a rolla 
motel room a few days earlier a police officer was wounded in that

more than 1100 descendants of a 
little bay horse foaled 200 years ago trotted danced or even 
popped out of a cake in honor of their breed 
maryland breeder w dayton sumner manager of the 50th annual 
new england morgan horse show said the sixday spectacle was a 
sort of homecoming for the first uniquely american breed of horse 
the morgans appeal is as universal as his versatility said 
laura frizzel of davison md awarding a citation and bottle of 
champagne to a group of enthusiasts in straw hats and jeans who 
hitched a trio of highstepping morgans to a hay wagon and joined 
the fancy carriage parade through downtown thursday evening 
first prize went to delaware millionaire henry ei dupont and 
his wife in an ornate antique hunting carriage drawn by four coal 
black morgans as they rolled smoothly down main street one of the 
three grooms in top hat and tails sounded a cheery flourish on an 
long brass hunting horn 
morgans who are equally at home in hunt clubs isolated cattle 
ranches or helping the police maintain order on city streets 
reflect the allaround characteristics that endeared them to new 
england farmers 
they wanted and got a horse strong enough to pull a plow small 
enough to require little maintenance and fast enough to ride 
a bronze plaque on a granite boulder along a street in suburban 
west springfield a few miles down the connecticut river marks the 
beginning of what the inscription simply calls that useful 
breed in 1789 
the small dark horse with black mane tail and feet who 
bestowed his characteristics on more than 100000 descendants 
originally was named figure by justin morgan the schoolteacher and 
singing master who raised and raced him in western massachusetts 
and vermont 
his lineage is unclear but some morgan historians believe he 
may have been sired by a tory colonels partarabian partenglish 
thoroughbred stallion liberated during the revolutionary war by 
farmers in retaliation for raids on their livestock

president bush facing battles with congress 
on several fronts says hes standing firm on his military spending 
plan but is willing to compromise on his proposal to cut the 
capital gains tax 
bush insisted friday that he will be able to have his way with 
the senate on his defense package even after the house this week 
shredded it slashing key components such as star wars the stealth 
bomber mobile mx missile and midgetman missile 
i am disappointed that the house did what they did bush 
told a news conference noting that the chamber restored money for 
some programs he wants to cut 
yesterday was not the houses most memorable moment but were 
going to keep fighting on for what we believe in 
but bush said hes willing to look at alternatives on his 
proposal to cut the 33 percent maximum capitalgains rate to 15 
percent 
if theres some compromise that can spur investment spur 
jobs increase employment the cause of new jobs starting up id 
be interested in it bush said i dont think i should ever say 
its got to be done just this way in terms of the bills up there in 
the house ways and means committee right now 
on another topic bush decried news leaks in the espionage 
investigation of us diplomat felix s bloch 
i dont want to go into it while it is under investigation 
bush said when asked about specifics 
i am very concerned about premature discussion and disclosure 
that means leaks on this matter because i think you can 
jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the mans ability to get a 
fair hearing 
no charges have been filed against bloch but the state 
department revoked his diplomatic passport and put him on paid 
leave june 22 he is under heavy fbi surveillance 
regarding the houses slash of 18 billion from his 49 
billion military spending request bush reaffirmed his commitment 
to his solid strategic program 
he said he will fight to win senate support to counter the house 
measure and that he needs everything hes proposing to strengthen 
his arms control position in talks with the soviet union 
bush also said 
hes confident his multibilliondollar bailout plan for the 
savings and loan industry will prevail despite a housesenate 
conference agreement this week that rejected a key funding 
mechanism on which he has insisted 
attacks on his nominee to head the justice departments civil 
rights division william lucas are pure gut politics he said 
he staunchly supports lucas who critics say is unqualified 
he still wants a constitutional amendment to ban burning of the 
american flag but didnt answer directly when asked if he would 
settle for a democraticsponsored effort passed this week by the 
house judiciary committee to outlaw flag burning through a statute 
rather than amending the constitution 
i will see what comes down here but i will continue to push 
for the approach that i think is the best given the supreme court 
decision he said 
he did not condone the kidnapping of a shiite moslem leader by 
israeli commandos in lebanon and doesnt know if it may lead to 
freedom for an american hostage 
he was frustrated over the us inability to get panamanian 
ruler manuel noriega out of power 
he would not respond to harsh criticisms leveled by outgoing 
customs commissioner william von raab who said he saw a lack of 
commitment or interest in the departments of state and treasury on 
fighting the drug war 
bush said the real question is how do we do better

radio is being illserved by voodoo 
priests at the federal communications commission who seem to 
think just about anyone should be able to own a station a 
broadcasting lobbyist says 
a deregulationminded fcc has been kind to broadcasters in many 
ways during the 1980s but has sometimes gone too far in its rush 
to impose a freemarket ethic said edward o fritts president of 
the national association of broadcasters 
if there were a modernday rip van winkle broadcaster who had 
gone to sleep in 1980 and reawakened this year he would scarcely 
believe the changes fritts said in remarks prepared for delivery 
today at the idaho state association of broadcasters meeting in sun 
valley 
the entire communications landscape has changed he said 
deregulation has come faster and gone farther than our industry 
ever asked or dreamed of 
under fcc chairman mark s fowler and his predecessor dennis r 
patrick the fairness doctrine has been lifted and broadcasters 
received favorable improvements in the licenserenewal process 
fritts said broadcasters were grateful for those victories but 
that the fcc has caused other headaches 
noting that the fcc loosened rules for acquiring radio station 
licenses fritts said it appeared the commission had become so 
obsessed with regulation by marketplace economic theory that it 
seemingly is interested in providing every man woman and child 
with their own radio station 
ole rip would be surprised that the fcc has no apparent 
concern for preserving the system of local service by financially 
healthy stations that has served the american public so well for 
the past 70 years he said our awakening broadcaster would 
think his world was being ruled by voodoo priests 
as a result of the fccs aliceinwonderland allocations 
policies it is faced with a growing backlog of applications for 
new facilities and minor station modifications 
fritts said an fcc official acknowledged recently that a new 
ruling allowing increased power for small fm stations may increase 
the application backlog from six months to 18 months 
and it was particularly galling to broadcasters he said that 
even as the backlog grows a deficitconscious congress wants to 
increase application fees by 13 percent 
fritts lashed out at fcc proposals to hold lotteries auctions 
and private negotiations to allocate and assign station licenses 
how can the commission say with a straight face that is can 
choose broadcast applicants who will best serve the public interest 
by reading pingpong balls or conducting lotteries 
the fcc fritts said has allowed so many new stations on the 
am band that it has created destructive interference and undermined 
the financial health of many stations to the determinant of local 
service

a former hud official says he made 
recommendations that ultimately benefited people with whom he 
now works and a congressman is calling for a justice department 
investigation 
joseph monticciolo former new york regional administrator for 
the department of housing and urban development was grilled friday 
by members of a house subcommittee investigating allegations of 
wrongdoing at hud 
he denied any wrongdoing during his sevenyear hud tenure but 
was harshly questioned by rep christopher shays rconn about a 
1984 memo in which monticciolo had made recommendations about a 
company he later joined 
i made recommendations to washington that ultimately benefited 
people who are now partners of mine monticciolo said adding 
that the final decision came from washington 
im going to have people look at what youve done because 
there was a quid pro quo shays said im hopeful and i would 
expect that the attorney generals office will look into what 
youve done because youve cashed in 
monticciolo is chief executive of eagle capital group a real 
estate development company with contracts in rockland county ny 
puerto rico and new jersey 
some of the partners were involved in a controversial 1983 deal 
in which they bought seven hud properties in new york and 
connecticut valued at 105 million price but put up only 550000 
the developers later sold the property making a reported 17 
million profit 
monticciolo said he had made recommendations to hud that 
benefited the developers who later hired him for a 125000ayear 
job and made him a 15 percent partner for no upfront cash 
at one point monticciolo told the panel that huds section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program was 50 percent political with 
half the money going to developers who were gop contributors or 
wellconnected to the administration monticciolo also said he had 
never recommended a project for that program which has been 
suspended 
but when shays confronted him with a hud memo about several such 
projects in new york and puerto rico monticciolos region the 
former administrator admitted having discussed the projects with 
the public housing authorities 
we cant rely on a thing you said rep bruce morrison 
dconn said you say one thing when you dont have the document 
and when the document is in front of you you say something 
diametrically opposed 
lance wilson former executive assistant to then hud secretary 
samuel pierce was to have been the first witness friday but he 
failed to show up 
wilson had asked for a postponement in his voluntary appearance 
because his lawyer was in the hospital it was the third time 
wilson had asked for an extension 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said the panel would 
vote wednesday on issuing a subpoena for wilson to appear sept 27 
and to produce all relevant documents and records

after a week of partisan bickering farmstate 
senators are inching toward compromise on legislation to provide 
federal payments to producers suffering crop losses from drought 
and other weatherrelated damage 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas dropped his 
opposition friday to an acrosstheboard disaster relief package 
and offered a proposal that a democratic leader said could clear 
the way for a bipartisan agreement 
sen doles flexibility will lead to an agreement on a final 
package that treats all farmers fairly sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee said in a 
statement 
we are moving toward common ground that fairly covers all 
demonstrated crop losses within reasonable spending levels 
dole had been leading opposition to a democraticsponsored 
measure providing 955 million to cover weatherrelated crop losses 
doles proposal estimated to cost 891 million would provide 
more assistance to farmers of the major grains who bought federal 
crop insurance and less to the hundreds of other commodities the 
socalled nonprogram crops because they are not covered by 
federal subsidy and price support programs 
the bush administration has said about 870 million in 
agricultural budget savings could be used for farm disaster relief 
so far the dispute in the senate has been over what crops 
should qualify for federal payments but pressure is building on 
lawmakers to take action 
congress is scheduled to recess aug 5 for a monthlong 
vacation and most farmstate members dont want to return home 
without having sent an aid bill to the white house 
dole has complained that the democratic measure approved by the 
agriculture committee on a partyline vote earlier in the week was 
potentially too expensive because it covered more than 500 crops 
but he moved closer to the democratic package friday with his 
compromise proposal 
faring best under doles proposal would be producers of wheat 
cotton rice corn and other crops participating in federal 
commodity programs and those who bought federal crop insurance 
they would be eligible for assistance on losses above 35 percent 
with payments covering 65 percent of their lost income 
farmers without crop insurance but enrolled in the federal farm 
programs would have to suffer losses of at least 40 percent under 
doles plan peanuts tobacco and sugar beet growers would be 
covered by the same provision 
soybean and sunflower farmers would be eligible for assistance 
if they suffered losses above 45 percent 
most crops not covered by government commodity programs 
everything from peaches and cherries to dry edible beans and 
potatoes must suffer losses exceeding 50 percent and would then 
receive payments covering 50 percent of the producers lost income 
the same 5050 formula would apply to farmers who are not 
enrolled in federal commodity programs but grow wheat corn grain 
sorghum and other socalled program crops 
under the democratic package farmers with crops enrolled in 
government commodity programs would qualify for assistance if they 
suffered 40 percent losses farmers of other crops would have to 
show a 45 percent loss the measure provided 65 percent payments 
for both 
a 1 billion disaster relief bill passed by the house last month 
would require a minimum loss of 35 percent for any crop to receive 
assistance

a top military adviser to soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev says the b2 stealth bomber wont give the united 
states an edge over the soviets 
for every action in life there is a reaction soviet marshal 
sergei akhromeyev told the national press club on friday 
so if the creation development and deployment of the b2 is 
an action in one way or another there will be some sort of 
reaction from the soviet union 
the house this week voted to suspend production of the b2 until 
the pentagon scales back the highpriced program and said the 
administration must show the stealth can successfully evade radar 
detection and penetrate soviet airspace before production resumes 
bush and his defense officials have lobbied hard for the bomber 
as a highly advanced piece of technology that would outstrip soviet 
radar capabilities 
akhromeyevs speech and questionandanswer session was the 
first by a senior soviet official at the press club since premier 
nikita krushchev in 1959 
akhromeyev told an audience that included adm william j crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that the trip in which he 
gave historic testimony to congress had encouraged him that soviet 
relations with the united states will continue to improve 
still he said that while the decrease in tension between nato 
and warsaw pact countries was a tremendous accomplishment the 
military threat unfortunately is still there 
akhromeyev wearing his red army uniform with 11 rows of 
ribbons went from the press club to a private white house meeting 
with president bush vice president dan quayle defense secretary 
dick cheney and secretary of state james a baker iii

batman is winging its way to britain but 
youngsters under 12 will have to stick to comic books to catch the 
caped crusader the national film board says the popular movie is 
unsuitable for little kids 
the british board of film classification applied its new 12 
category to the movie that opens aug 11 in britain with michael 
keaton playing the title role and jack nicholson starring as his 
evil nemesis the joker 
the category bars youngsters under 12 from a film no matter what 
parents decide in the united states the comparable pg13 is only 
an advisory guideline for parents while the r rating restricts 
minors from seeing a particular movie 
a spokesman for filmmaker warner brothers said the british 
decision was quite in keeping with the nature of the film it is 
for the producers to decide what kind of film they wish to make and 
what they have come up with is not like the old comic strip 
television series from the 60s this batman comes out at night 
a film board spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity in 
keeping with british practice said the new designation was created 
because the old 15 classification wound up keeping children 
between the ages of 12 and 14 out of movies that may be suitable 
for them 
early times a childrens newspaper said we are concerned 
that many children under 12 in the light of the hype and publicity 
over batman will be bitterly disappointed over the rating of this 
film as 12 certificate particularly as the impression has been 
created that it is a summer family film

the bush administration has four days to 
explain why it suspended rules designed to protect endangered 
species of sea turtles after protests by shrimp fishermen in 
louisiana and texas 
us district court judge thomas hogan on friday refused to 
grant an order sought by the national wildlife federation to 
require the government immediately to enforce the suspended 
regulations for gulf coast shrimp fishermen 
but hogan called the federations case a strong one and said 
the government has until tuesday to detail under what legal 
authority secretary of commerce robert mosbacher suspended the 
regulations hogan scheduled another hearing for thursday 
justice department lawyer michelle kuruc said at a hearing that 
the basis for mosbachers action was that public safety was 
endangered by the protests 
bob irvin a wildlife federation lawyer said he was 
disappointed that the judge had denied the order but was 
encouraged by his comments that the wildlife group had a strong 
case 
the rules suspended monday would have required the use of 
devices that keep sea turtles from becoming entangled in trawlers 
nets 
instead mosbacher said shrimpers in 45 days would have to obey 
still another set of rules requiring them to lift their nets every 
90 minutes or sooner so turtles can escape turtles can live that 
long if trapped according to members of congress supporting the 
shrimpers 
before the court hearing the national audubon society and the 
defenders of wildlife called for a nationwide boycott of shrimp to 
protest the fishermens tactics 
the suit filed tuesday said mosbacher was inflicting 
irreparable harm on five species of sea turtles that are listed as 
threatened or endangered 
the national marine fisheries service estimates that 11000 
turtles die each year in shrimpers nets 
last weekend angry shrimpers used their boats to block ship

whatever it can to find out if american servicemen are still being 
held in southeast asia 
we will do everything that a government can to recover the 
missing and if we discover proof of captivity we will take action 
to bring our men home bush said friday in a speech to the 
national league of families of american prisoners and missing in 
southeast asia

for as a result of the conflict in southeast asia most 1714 
are in vietnam the rest are in laos cambodia and china 
bush called on hanoi to shed light on the fate of the 
missing and said the pace of restoring diplomatic relations with 
vietnam could be impeded unless that country cooperates on the 
powmia issue

a ban on smoking aboard airline flights of two 
hours or less would become permanent under a bill sent to the house 
floor but antismoking forces say they expect tougher restrictions 
in the final bill 
tobacco industry lobbyists ended up pushing for the permanent 
ban friday after a 2525 vote on a ban that would have covered all 
domestic flights indicated growing congressional support for 
proposals to broaden the airline smoking ban 
the tie vote defeated the wider ban but it was the closest a 
congressional vote has come to outlawing all smoking on airliners 
the bill passed on a voice vote by the house public works and 
transportation committee is one of several proposals to extend or 
expand the 1987 temporary smoking ban on flights of two hours or 
less that ban expires in april 
opponents made tongueincheek suggestions that liquor cheap 
cologne and crying babies could also be banned because they offend 
some people 
rep william clinger rpa who supported the permanent ban but 
opposed all proposals that would affect flights over two hours 
joked that the committee might vote to install cheap cologne 
detectors and put crying babies in the hold 
rep james oberstar dminn who pushed for a total smoking 
ban said the committees defeat of attempts to apply the ban to 
longer flights reflects strong lobbying by the tobacco industry 
oberstar said a more farreaching ban would likely pass the 
house but he declined to predict what the senate might do 
one of the measures to extend the smoking ban is in the form of 
an amendment to an appropriations bill the house is expected to 
take that up next week 
oberstar described fridays vote as a shortterm gain for 
the tobacco industry which at first opposed making the twohour 
ban permanent however several tobacco lobbyists switched 
strategies as the committee was voting 
in the end prosmoking forces supported a permanent ban while 
antismoking committee members voted for a fouryear extension of 
the temporary ban in the hope of ensuring that congress again would 
have to consider a total ban 
antismoking groups have said they will continue to fight 
against smoking on any airliner 
the twohour ban is far from a perfect piece of legislation 
and very far from the solution needed to protect all airline 
passengers and all flight crews from the serious hazards created by 
tobacco smoke in the airline cabin said ahron leichtman 
president of citizens against tobacco smoke 
rep gus savage dill who said his wife of 34 years died from 
cancer called inflight smoking a lifeanddeath issue 
on an airplane you cant open the window when someone else 
smokes in midair you cant transfer planes savage said 
rights are for now but death is forever

the kidnapping of a shiite moslem cleric by 
israeli commandos could put pressure on proiranian terrorists to 
free some of the foreign hostages held in lebanon according to 
israeli officials 
clearly when you capture one of their top leaders it can deter 
terrorism and you have a certain amount of leverage in your 
hands army spokesman col raanan gissin said of fridays raid by 
helicopterborne commandos 
seized by the commandos were cleric sheik abdul karim obeid his 
cousin ahmed obeid and a friend majid fahs a lebanese police 
spokesman told reporters 
gissin said obeid and two assistants were safely in 
israeli hands and undergoing questioning 
one person was killed in the assault on an apartment building in 
the village of jibchit 20 miles north of the israeli border and 35 
miles south of beirut according to lebanese and israeli reports 
lebanese police said a neighbor hussein abu zeid opened the 
door of his apartment during the raid and was shot to death by the 
commandos israel radio said zeid was one of obeids bodyguards 
even before fridays abductions some israeli officials said the 
capture of a lebanese shiite leader supported by iran could 
influence the release of three israeli servicemen kidnapped in 
southern lebanon in 1986 
lebanese security sources suggested obeid may have been abducted 
in a plan to exchange him for us marine lt col william r 
higgins or other foreign hostages the sources also have linked 
obeid with higgins abduction 
higgins of danville ky was kidnapped in southern lebanon 
feb 17 1988 while serving with an observer group attached to the 
un peacekeeping force in southern lebanon 
seventeen foreign hostages are held in lebanon including nine 
americans and three britons but not counting the israeli 
servicemen it is belived most of the hostages are captives of 
proiranian terrorist groups affiliated with hezbollah or party of 
god 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press has been held the longest he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 and a shiite moslem group islamic holy war has said it 
is holding him 
gissin called obeid the equivalent of the commander of the 
hezbollah terrorist organization in south lebanon 
obeid 33 has denied involvment with the fundamenalist islamic 
group but israel and the us state department have called him a 
member of hezbollah 
britains foreign office deplored the kidnapping saying it 
could jeopardize the lives of the foreign hostages and called for 
his release 
gissin disagreed and said hezbollah leaders will now think 
twice before harming their hostages 
they value the lives of their leaders far more then they value 
the lives of their suicide fighters he added 
gissen said hezbollah guerrillas have attempted at least 20 
crossborder raids into israel this year 
an israeli foreign ministry spokesman told reporters israel 
said many times in the past that when the fight against terrorism 
is at stake it reserves the right to respond whenever it finds it 
suitable and effective 
the three israeli troopers believed held hostage in lebanon are 
soldiers rahamim alsheikh and yossi fink captured feb 17 1986 
when guerrillas ambushed their patrol and air force navigator ron 
arad seized oct 16 1986 when his plane was shot down 
lebanese police the israeli news media and witnesses gave these 
accounts of the jibchit raid 
three helicopters took part in the operation about 12 commandos 
with silencerequipped pistols surrounded obeids building and 
forced their way into his apartment 
israeli television said the troopers blasted the front door of 
obeids apartment with plastic explosives seized obeid and the 
other men and rushed them to a helicopter that departed in the 
attack that lasted less then 30 minutes 
obeids wife mona was locked in a room with her hands tied and 
her mouth taped shut 
irans foreign ministry issued a statment saying this 
shameless act by the zionist regime will not remain unanswered by 
the moslem and combatant forces

the daily raising of chinas scarlet flag in 
tiananmen square used to draw a motley audience of dozens and cause 
small brief traffic jams in the bicycle lane adjoining the square 
allnight food vendors street sweepers pedicab drivers 
drifters anyone who happened to be up would gather at the 
flagpole to watch three soldiers goosestep out of the imperial 
palace and march into the square to raise the flag 
these days however watching the national flag go up requires 
an invitation or advance permission 
the square has been closed to the general public since june 4 
when the crackdown on the prodemocracy movement began and soldiers 
backed by tanks drove student protesters from the square the 
symbolic center of china bicyclists now are forbidden to stop 
along its edge 
today about a dozen foreign journalists and more than 80 
children from the wangfujing elementary school had permission to 
watch the flag raising 
the students wore the red kerchiefs of the young pioneers the 
communist party childrens organization and their teacher said 
they were there to learn to love the country and love the army 
the children marched silently onto the 100acre square led by a 
halfdozen young soldiers who barked commands at them forward 
right face sit 
except for the soldiers and city buses that lumbered by the 
stilldark square was silent at the far end on the monument to 
revolutionary heroes that the students had turned into a protest 
command post two soldiers stood guard while six comrades napped 
wrapped up in bedrolls on the stone pavement 
at 530 am the squares lights blinked off and the children 
sat silently on the pavement at 552 am 12 minutes later than 
scheduled three soldiers emerged from the palace gate bearing the 
flag 
the ceremony has been modified since june 4 two other soldiers 
stood guard with submachine guns 
upon order the children raised their right arms in salute as 
the flag went up the few without neckerchiefs stood with arms at 
their sides apparently not allowed the honor of saluting their 
flag 
a few silent minutes and it was over the children sat back 
down for a brief lecture by a whitegloved soldier on the history 
of chinas flag it is the color of fresh blood he told the 
students reminding them of the bloody civil war that preceded the 
communist rise to power 
a quick march around the square and the children were off to 
school officers roused the sleeping soldiers with shouts of 
hey bedrolls under their arms they stumbled off the monument 
before june 4 sunrise was the signal for dozens of pedestrians 
to stream onto the square to take their morning exercise and enjoy 
the freshest air of the day 
today more than 50 army trucks each bearing about 36 soldiers 
pulled up in rows on one side of the vast expanse 
they are here to see the mao tsetung memorial hall and the 
great hall of the people and zhongnanhai the party headquarters 
said an officer who refused to identify the unit its a good 
chance for them to see these things they would not otherwise see 
the memorial hall where revolutionary leader maos preserved 
body is exhibited has been closed to the public since the building 
underwent repairs over the winter when will it and the square 
reopen 
i dont know im sure sooner or later the officer said

president bush says hell do his best to make 
sure that exxon lives up to its responsibility to clean the 
oilsoaked shores of alaska 
if i had the feeling exxon was going to pull back on an 
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement theyd made with us with 
the government or with the state of alaska i would try my 
best to do something about it bush said at a news conference 
friday 
the presidents remarks came hours after exxon executives told a 
congressional panel that the company will suspend cleanup 
operations for the winter by midseptember 
however company officials said they would agree to any 
reasonable continuation of the cleanup next spring 
more than 700 miles of shoreline have been damaged as a result 
of the march spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil from 
the tanker exxon valdez in the nations worst oil spill 
us coast guard vice adm clyde lusk told the interior 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources that he 
expected that there would be disagreements on what should be 
done with differences in opinion as to what constitutes a clean 
beach 
what is clean lusk asked i dont know how were going to 
make that decision 
exxons plans have been questioned since the disclosure earlier 
this week of an internal memorandum that said no commitment 
should be made on when to suspend or resume cleanup 
alaska officials interpreted the july 19 memo as an indication 
exxon was preparing to pull out even though the cleanup is far 
from completed 
bush asked by reporters about the matter said he expected 
exxon to live up to its commitment 
the brouhaha prompted fridays subcommittee hearing 
the memo written by the manager of exxons cleanup operation in 
alaska suggests exxon is putting together its plan for 
demobilization without coast guard approval said subcommittee 
chairman george miller dcalif 
wd stevens president of exxon co usa called the wording of 
the memo unfortunate 
the company he said will withdraw its equipment and estimated 
10000 workers from the region beginning sept 15 because of 
potential safety problems with rough seas and weather 
exxon will return in the spring of 1990 to reinspect the area 
to assure that the job has been properly done and if not to put 
it right stevens said 
but when miller pressed him about whether exxon will resume 
cleanup in the spring stevens said he couldnt give an 
unequivocal commitment 
i think it would be naive to do that he said we will 
follow through on any reasonable request that is made by the 
coast guard 
lusk said federal and state officials as well as scientists and 
exxon representatives would participate in the inspection next 
spring but the coast guard has no authority to require exxon to do 
additional cleaning at specific sites he said 
exxon executives said friday that about 600 miles of 
contaminated shoreline had been treated but alaskas chief 
environmental official put the figure at about 190 miles saying 
that in many cases oil has seeped back into the rocks and pebbles 
we cannot imagine how exxon can conclude 600 miles have been 
treated said dennis kelso the commissioner of alaskas 
department of environmental conservation 
if that statement were made in kodiak or homer the roof would 
rise maybe theyre looking at a different gulf

eskimos from four nations guarding a 
tradition of hunting and fur trading criticized animal 
conservationists for threatening the culture of arctic people 
rosemarie kuptana vice president of the inuit circumpolar 
conference urged delegates to force environmentalists and animal 
conservationists to answer our arguments the greenland 
newspaper information reported friday 
our opponents are much weeker when it is we who set the 
agenda ms kuptana a canadian told the 500 inuit delegates at 
a conferences meeting in sisimuit west greenland 
it was the first time a soviet delegation attended a general 
assembly of the conference a nongovernmental organization for 
inuit from alaska canada greenland and soviet union 
anger is growing among arctic natives toward conservationist 
groups such as greenpeace whose campaigns the eskimos say have 
damaged hunting and the fur trade 
it never ceases to amaze me how people can react so strongly 
against traditional hunting on the part of a little group of 
indigenous people people who during thousands of years of hunting 
never have threatened a single animal species while at the same 
time industrialized society has polluted the planet to such a 
degree that there is no way back ms kuptana said 
greenpeaces kirsten sander who attended the conference as an 
observer admitted that the groups campaign against seal skins in 
recent years had done unintended harm to inuit hunters 
to counter future antiharvesting campaigns the conference 
unveiled a farreaching inuit conservation strategy 
this policy largely the initiative of conference members from 
canada and greenland embraces all aspects of environmental concern 
in the arctic 
peter jull a former inuit adviser to the canadian government 
said the document calls for detailed research on the environment 
and wildlife including all species that inuits depend on for food 
and clothing 
he said the plan was partly an expression that the environment 
is our interest and not just for the benefit of companies down 
south somewhere 
the conference also compiled a guide of policy principles on 
issues including nuclear power education and selfgovernment for 
use at the regional and local levels 
what were basically saying is that we live in the arctic and 
we know what happens when you mess it up jull said 
about 40000 inuit live in greenland 28000 in alaska and 
11000 in canada the soviet inuit comprise a small part of the 
150000 natives of the siberian north

the firedamaged jackson laboratory is 
taking on a crash program to replenish the nations supply of rare 
research mice and gambling that tax money will keep it in business 
the worlds leading producer of unusual laboratory mice is using 
all its resources on mouse production rather than rebuilding its 
director said 
the fire two months ago at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor 
crippled much medical research 
by not using its insurance money to construct a permanent 
facility the laboratory is facing the possibility that it will go 
out of business in as little as a year 
our responsibility was to get research animals out as fast as 
possible and worry about the financial problems later the 
laboratorys director kenneth paigen said friday 
the loss of the laboratorys mouse production facilities is 
currently creating very serious problems for research scientists 
all over the world said dr james b wyngaarden director of the 
national institutes of health in a recent letter to the jackson 
laboratory 
the laboratory is the worlds leading center for the study of 
mouse genetics the fire on may 10 destroyed the laboratorys mouse 
production facilities and killed 400000 research mice 
the laboratory was supplying 20 percent of the nations 
laboratory mice including many unusual strains unavailable 
elsewhere 
the mice are essential to research on arthritis lupus 
cancer heart disease aids and some 4000 hereditary diseases 
said nancy wexler president of the hereditary disease foundation 
in a letter to the laboratory 
paigen said the laboratorys interim production facilities to 
be housed in large trailers could produce 24000 mice a week by 
the fall before the fire the laboratory was producing 40000 mice 
a week 
the howard hughes medical institute in bethesda md sent the 
laboratory an unsolicited check for 750000 the arthur k watson 
charitable trust of new york city gave the laboratory 400000 
paigen estimated losses from the fire at 40 million and said 
insurance will reimburse about 15 million 
the laboratory has asked congress for 25 million a bill is 
pending in the senate that would give that amount to the national 
institutes of health to help restore the nations supply of 
research mice 
paigen is optimistic that much or all of that money if approved 
by congress would be awarded to jackson laboratory 
jackson laboratory mice have been used for 60 years to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of bone marrow transplants in 
treating some kinds of cancer to understand the genetics of heart 
disease the causes of diabetes and the basis of many inherited 
disorders 
the fire is delaying much of that research 
for example the mayo clinic was set to begin testing a new 
arthritis drug with jackson laboratory mice this summer the 
research has been put on hold until the mice are again available 
paigen said 
mice are useful for research because they can be bred to develop 
diseases similar to many human diseases 
the fire began when a flammable adhesive being used by workmen 
ignited paigen said everybody who works at the lab mobilized to 
get as many animals out as they could he said we actually 
saved a hundred thousand animals 
no strains of mice were permanently lost a few animals of each 
strain or in some cases frozen embryos were stored outside the 
production facility as a safety measure the problem now is to 
increase the numbers of those mice

mysterious gunshot and a plane crash near the bahamas has been 
sued by investors who claim he cost them 125000 in a case before

investors who tried to get an fcc license in 1987 to build an fm 
radio station

claims he committed legal malpractice by lying about some things 
failing to attend to details associated with getting a license and 
keeping the investors from getting a cash settlement from another 
group that ultimately got the license

root and five other groups were trying to get the same license 
approval for the new orleans area according to the suit

and other injuries stemming from the crash of a small plane he was 
piloting july 13 he is at his parents home in plymouth ohio 
about 50 miles southwest of cleveland 
his father thomas f root contacted by telephone early 
saturday about the suit said im not aware of it and i 
wouldnt have any comment the elder root said his son was not 
available for comment 
root had set out on a business trip flying from arlington va 
to rocky mount nc and later told air traffic controllers he was 
having trouble breathing he put his plane on autopilot and 
military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel 
and ditched near the bahamas 
root says he was unconscious until his plane hit the water but 
the military pilots said they saw his head move he also insists he 
does not know how he received the gunshot wound to the abdomen 
which was found after his rescue 
the lawsuit claims that root told his groups lead investor c 
lee armstrong clear that the other competing groups would be 
willing to pay belle chasse a 125000 settlement for dropping its 
license application 
however the suit alleges root subsequently told attorneys for 
the other groups that he had been having trouble locating his 
clients and that clear and belle chasse had decided to dismiss 
their application 
the fcc filed an order of involuntary dismissal against the 
application and root allowed it to go through without telling the 
belle chasse investors what he had done the suit alleged 
attorney bruce waltzer said the group that eventually won the 
license paid settlements to all of the other groups except belle 
chasse 
fcc officials said last week that root who was paid about 
50000 by the belle chasse group had been involved in many cases 
in which groups received settlements in exchange for dropping their 
applications

over a cup of coffee or a piece of 
homemade pie at lizzies cafe folks talk about the silvery pagoda 
that rises 82 feet out of the prairie 
its the closest thing to a tourist attraction weve got 
said lizzie guthmiller who runs the only cafe in this central 
north dakota farming community of 125 residents 
the structure is the brainchild of henry luehr who declared it 
finished a year ago after working on it about five years 
i guess i call it finished because when theres nothing else 
to do you just have to call it done said the 69yearold 
repairman who has lived in the area all his life 
about 1500 people some from as far away as japan and 
czechoslovakia have toured luehrs tapering tower 15 miles off 
interstate 94 and 60 miles from bismarck tey sign their names in a 
green spiral notebook that serves as a guest register 
the idea came to him when he was trying to decide what to do 
with wood from a friends razed grain elevator luehr said recently 
as he easily maneuvered his tall lean frame up a stairway to the 
pagodas eight floors 
luehr wanted to build something with the rotting wood but he 
wanted to do it without scaffolding a pagoda was the answer he 
decided 
walkways encircle each of its levels from the ground floor that 
measures 26 feet in diameter to the top floor with a 19foot 
diameter 
luehr sketched his plan for the pagoda from encyclopedia 
pictures and then went to work on it alone 
i seem to work faster that way he said 
luehr used aluminum press plates from two newspapers as siding 
and old irrigation pipes as walkway railings 
the inside decor carpeting drapes and wall ornaments came 
from junkyards and auctions some of the artwork including six 
pictures of a black sun rising and setting was done by luehr 
himself 
i didnt spend hardly any money said luehr i didnt have 
any money to spend not on this dumb pagoda anyway 
luehrs talent for frugal construction has been with him all his 
life he remembers that at age 7 he built a playhouse with leftover 
house shingles and in 1941 he put up a barn half of which included 
used lumber 
he also has crafted a pair of doll housesize castles a 
geodesic dome and a huge workshop in which he operates a farm 
machinery repair service 
hes always got to have something to do said luehrs wife 
elaine without the pagoda to work on last winter he talked 14 
to 16 hours a day 
ive got so much time so much energy luehr explained a 
smile brightening his tanned weathered face 
and the pagoda wont be his last project he said 
i havent figured out what to do next thats all

when sister elaine fischer received her 
calling from god she never expected to serve him wearing a 
flameretardant suit and lugging heavy water hoses 
but her decision to become a firefighter was received 
enthusiastically by fellow nuns at the mount saint scholastica 
convent in atchison 40 miles northwest of kansas city 
sister fischer a benedictine novice who is to take her 
temporary vows next summer began working at the local fire 
department on friday 
the sisters are all very excited for me she said in a 
telephone interview theyre excited that one of us is doing 
something to help the community 
her decision to become a nun two years ago was something of a 
surprise to her family since it came after she had earned a 
biochemistry degree from kansas state university by comparison 
becoming a firefighter was a minor threshhold to cross she said 
my family is very supportive she said after i joined the 
convent nothing would shock them 
for sister fischer 23 a certified emergency medical technician 
with a love for physical activity the decision to battle earthly 
flames came naturally 
i really wanted to be an emt but you cant do one without the 
other here and firefighting intrigues me she said 
although this is probably the first situation weve had here 
like this fire chief michael mcdermed said he didnt hesitate to 
hire sister fischer who finished first among 15 applicants after 
passing a vigorous physical exam and written and oral examinations 
the 27member department already has female firefighters and 
sister fischer finished the physical exam which must be completed 
in 20 minutes and includes carrying hoses weighing 50 pounds up and 
down a fivefloor training tower in 14 minutes which is really 
not a bad score mcdermed said 
sister fischer insists on being called elaine in the 
workplace and wants to be treated like any new trainee so far her 
prayers have been answered 
i think theyre very relaxed around me its been very 
comfortable they dont treat me as anything other than a new 
employee she said 
firefighter phil regan said at first he wasnt quite sure how to 
act 
i was a little hesitant of what was going to be expected of us 
as far as attitude you know your language just out of respect 
for her he said you know when you just say something bad 
you say oh god i didnt mean that 
word of the blazebattling nun surprised residents of atchison 
population 11436 regan said but shes strong and shes willing 
to work and shes fun to be with 
growing up on a farm southwest of kansas city accustomed her to 
working with her hands sister fischer said at the convent her 
hobbies include maintenance anything from gardening to painting 
and woodwork 
shes spunky but in a quiet way said sister angela 
ostermann director of formation at the convent 
when she first told me about the job i think i was a little 
surprised sister ostermann said but then as we talked about 
it we felt it was a very good way of serving the local community

inmates at a state prison want a federal 
judge to let them fix up the 91yearold building themselves and 
use it for treatment and training programs 
the tennessee state prison was ordered closed by us district 
judge thomas higgins as a result of a lawsuit filed on behalf of 
all prisoners in the state the 1982 order declared the states 
prison system unconstitutional because of overcrowding and poor 
conditions 
were not asking for justice prisoner james b proctor told 
gov ned mcwherter during a recent meeting on the renovation 
proposal were asking for mercy 
of the prisons 1200 inmates 506 signed a petition filed 
friday with higgins to keep the prison open for vocational and 
educational programs and psychiatric drug and alcohol treatment 
for longterm prisoners 
the prisoners propose that the prison house 500 convicts who 
have served at least eight years on sentences of 35 years or more 
the court orders require the prison to close as soon as enough 
new prisons open to provide room for its inmates one prison is to 
open in september another in january and three more by 1992 
a month ago higgins denied the states petition to renovate 
part of the tennesee state prison as a special facility for 500 sex 
offenders and mentally and physically disabled inmates 
but the petitioning inmates said they hope to change higgins 
mind 
by using an inmate workforce labor construction and 
renovation costs will be drastically reduced they said in court 
papers by bringing education vocational training and industry 
into such an environment an inmate can contribute to his own 
support 
higgins has said any modification in previous orders must first 
be approved by patrick mcmanus a special prison master he 
appointed to keep tabs on the states progress in upgrading the 
prison system 
higgins said in his order last month that he supports the 
position of gordon bonnyman a lawyer who has represented prisoners 
since 1975 bonnyman also wants tennessee state prison closed 
bonnyman said friday he would have no comment on the prisoners

three cubans who survived almost a week at sea were 
rescued by a soviet spy ship prowling off cape canaveral which 
turned them over to the coast guard 
us officials who had no recollection of any previous rescue 
by soviet sailors of fleeing cubans were puzzling over why the 
ship had not turned over the men found floating 26 miles off the 
florida coast to cuban authorities 
in the time ive been here in miami this is the first time 
coast guard spokesman luis diaz said friday ive had two tours 
of duty here so this is something new for us 
the men were badly sunburned dehydrated and exhausted after a 
sixday 125mile voyage during which they lost a companion and at 
one point resorted to catching a bird with bare hands and eating it 
raw 
they were taken to jackson memorial hospital and treated for 
dehydration and severe sunburn a hospital spokesman said they were 
in stable condition friday night 
the soviet ship identified in the reference book janes 
fighting ships as the 274foot zaporozhye spotted the three 
clinging to an inner tube and rescued them friday morning the 
coast guard said the soviet captain refused to allow a coast guard 
party to board and the cubans were transferred by raft to a patrol 
boat for their trip to miami 
the refugees identified themselves as arsenio gomez hernandez 
46 his son pedro gomez cruz 17 and arsenios brother humberto 
valentin gomez 48 
junior arlais gomez 20 cousin and nephew to the others was 
lost at sea 
the men had secretly built a 12foot wooden rowboat in cuba 
which they loaded with supplies and tied to a tractortrailer tire 
inner tube 
the rowboat overturned monday night in rough seas spilling 
their provisions the men clung to the inner tube 
they caught some small fish by hand arsenio gomez said a 
seabird landed on his head at one point he said he managed to 
catch it and they ate it 
the men lost track of time and werent sure when arlais became 
delirious and thought he saw the lights of miami he let go of the 
tube and drifted away they said 
cuban refugees who make it to florida usually are turned over to 
the us immigration and naturalization service and released to 
relatives after questioning 
the coast guard has picked up 97 cubans on rafts this year 31 
this month alone 
the soviet ship has been operating for several months off cape 
canaveral on intelligencecollecting operations said us navy lt 
cmdr steve burnett atlantic fleet spokesman in norfolk va 
coast guardsman jeff slater said the soviets may not have 
realized the men were fleeing cuba the first information we 
tried to get was their nationality he said the soviets 
answered either cuban or haitian

antinuclear activists who halted 
the firing of a trident 2 missile from a submarine said they wont 
block the rescheduled launch but will continue their political 
battle against the weapon 
four greenpeace usa vessels forced postponement of the launch 
friday when they sailed into an offlimits danger area in the 
atlantic 50 miles off cape canaveral and ignored repeated warnings 
to leave 
it was the first time in the 38year history of cape canaveral 
that such a protest had stopped a launching 
steve shellhorn commander of one of the greenpeace ships said 
the activists would not be back at sea when the launch is 
rescheduled 
we think we made our point and weve been quite successful in 
focusing attention on americas most expensive missile system and 
in delaying its operational date shellhorn said friday 
we dont think we can match the navy test for test so we will 
concentrate on eliminating the trident 2 through the political 
process he said but we wont rule out returning to the range 
eventually 
the navy called off the trident 2 test several hours after the 
greenpeace vessels penetrated the safety zone 
a statement said the launch was postponed because of 
intentional interference from foreign flag ships in a designated 
hazardous operational area concern for safety of the 
interfering ships precluded the launch of the test missile 
were happy about it of course greenpeace spokeswoman 
shannon fagan said but we would be happier if the navy cancelled 
the trident 2 missile altogether 
fagan said two large greenpeace ships and two motorized rafts 
shadowed the submarine for hours exercising their right to operate 
in international waters safety regulations require that a 
countdown be stopped if nonessential boats approach within about 
three miles of the submarine 
one of the motorized rafts slipped up to the submerged tennessee 
and the threeman crew attached three nuclear free seas banners 
to the submarine two to the radio mast and one on the side fagan 
said 
she said a navy whale boat dispatched from a cruiser twice 
rammed one of the greenpeace boats the 60foot ketch 
monticivitano after warning it and the other intruding vessels 
that they were in danger because a missile launch was imminent the 
damage was minor she said 
the mv greenpeace a 190foot vessel flew the dutch flag the 
monticivitano sails under swedish registry 
the navy had no comment on the greenpeace reports 
it was to have been the second underwater test firing of the 
trident 2 the navys newest most powerful weapon the first test 
on march 21 ended in an explosion when the 237 million missile 
pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was launched from 
the tennessee nineteen land launch pad tests 15 of them 
successful preceded the sea trials 
the navy has said it plans to have the trident 2 operational and 
on station next march the weapon has a range of 4600 miles and 
can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads twentyfour missiles are 
carried on each sub

vacationers arent necessarily changing their plans but theyre 
asking what kind of aircraft their flights will use following the 
crash of two dc10 jetliners travel agents say 
the dc10 has created a problem for us with our leisure 
travelers said deidre green of shamrock international travel in 
fort worth texas 
business travelers know theyve got to get wherever theyve 
got to get on the best schedule but those who fly less 
frequently are questioning the type of aircraft theyll be on she 
said 
as long as the fares about the same they are changing she 
said 
still most passengers are deciding to stay with a dc10 flight 
after talking it over agents said 
you just have to have faith and just say you know what i 
cant afford to get hung up on this said mike dorman of 
hickorycalmart travel service in irvine calif 
theyre expressing concern but the most important thing to 
them is convenience said agent deb mcnulty of salem mass who 
said friday she had a flurry of calls about dc10s this week 
some passengers who saw diagrams of where sioux city survivors 
were sitting in the plane are asking for specific seats she said 
i had a man yesterday decline a reservation on a flight because 
he couldnt get a seat over the wing green said 
a united airlines dc10 crashed in sioux city iowa on july 19 
killing 111 and a korean air dc10 crashed thursday in the fog at 
tripoli libya killing at least 71 passengers initial 
investigation of the sioux city crash indicated a tail engine blew 
apart and cut off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to control the 
jet 
friday a canadian airlines dc10 with 254 people aboard lost a 
wing wheel but landed safely at pearson international airport in 
toronto 
some people take it really serious said yolanda zalitis of 
garber travel in boston who reported at least two people had asked 
for different planes because of nervousness 
what people are doing is inquiring about it said elaine 
tynus owner of lakeshore travel in chicago 
some of my own personal clients ive called and asked them if 
they want to change some people have no desire to she said 
crashes may give some passengers jitters but theres no real 
reason for fear said capt frank petee a former pilot and a 
director of usairs fearful flyers program 
an average 18000 commercial flights carry more than 1 million 
people daily in the united states and safety records are improving 
not slipping he said 
when you get right down to it any airplane thats 
certificated by the government by the federal aviation 
administration is a safe plane to fly on it really is said 
petee 
the sioux city crash was a one in 2 billion chance that 
something that catastrophic would happen said petee whose 
airline does not fly dc10s 
agencies that handle primarily corporate bookings reported far 
fewer calls of concern and some agencies reported no increase in 
calls about airline equipment or declined comment citing company 
policy against commenting on crashes

consult with president daniel arap moi of kenya in the next few 
days to prepare the way for peace talks between warring sides in 
mozambique

has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and made half of 
mozambiques 147 million people wholly or partly dependent on food 
aid 
mugabe said he expects to contact moi in the next few days 
to arrange preliminary talks with officials of the rebel mozambique 
national resistance also known by the portuguese acronym renamo 
the peace initiative headed by moi aims at bringing the 
guerrillas to a conference table with representatives of president 
joaquim chissanos marxistoriented government mugabe said 
we are looking forward to cooperation by renamo as much 
cooperation as possible he told reporters friday a day after 
his return from an organization of african unity summit in addis 
ababa ethiopia 
we hope eventually there will be direct contact between the 
mozambique government and renamo it is these two parties that must 
negotiate a settlement to their problems he said 
mozambican rebels have been fighting for 12 years to oust the 
maputo government and are accused of widespread atrocities they 
are considered rightwing because they used to be armed by south 
africa but their political goals are unclear 
mugabe said chissano asked him on july 10 to join moi as a 
mediator to end the fighting that coupled with mismanagement and a 
weak infrastructure inherited from portuguese colonizers has 
placed mozambique among the worlds poorest nations 
mugabe met with moi at the african summit and the two agreed to 
draft parameters on the way we hope to operate and compare 
notes soon afterward mugabe said 
he said a meeting with mozambican rebel officials will follow 
but gave no details 
landlocked zimbabwe has 12000 troops fighting alongside 
mozambican government forces and guarding transport links and an 
oil pipeline through mozambique to the indian ocean 
the proposed rapprochement follows a usbrokered peace accord 
for southern african involving independence for namibia and the 
withdrawal of south african and cuban troops in angola 
until the june 22 ceasefire between angolas government and 
jonas savimbis usbacked rebels zimbabwe opposed similar 
negotiations in mozambique 
at first the mozambican rebels rejected mugabe as too partisan 
to mediate but earlier this month they accepted his role in the 
peace initiative 
chissanos government is debating negotiations with the rebels 
at the annual congress of its ruling front for the liberation of 
mozambique the countrys sole legal political party 
the congress friday presented a new policy document that drops 
all references to marxism leninism and western imperialism but it 
says the party remains committed to socialism 
the alterations coincide with a new government drive to end 
central control of the economy and reflects maptuos improving 
relations with western countries such as the united states italy 
and britain

the goddess of democracy will stand again in 
beijings tiananmen square pledged chinese dissidents attending 
the first congress of chinese students in the united states 
some say china has no hope for democracy but i say the hope 
is just beginning wuer kaixi a leader of the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing said friday at the opening ceremony of the 
conference 
i believe the chinese can be united and will erect a goddess 
of democracy in tiananmen square one day wuer told about 400 
people at an auditorium at the university of illinois at chicago 
delegates from 130 universities are attending the organizations 
founding conference which will wind up sunday thousands of 
chinese students who were studying abroad when the government 
crushed the student democracy movement in beijing and other cities 
have decided not to return home 
wuer 21 who fled china after the military crackdown there in 
june told the crowd to continue the battle for democracy we 
cant rely on begging or wait for a next time he said we must 
try now 
behind him a plaster replica of the goddess of democracy 
erected by chinese protesters in beijing overlooked the crowd 
which cheered and stamped their feet as wuer shouted prodemocracy 
slogans 
the original goddess fashioned after the statue of liberty was 
torn down by the chinese government after the military crushed the 
student democracy movement that had occupied tiananmen square 
the students dismissed the communist partys announcement friday 
that it was reining in corruption and nepotism the party shut down 
two stateowned conglomerates including one linked to senior 
leader deng xiaopings son and ordered an end to many of the 
special privileges enjoyed by high officials 
the politburo order clearly was a response to the student 
movement which struck a deep chord among hundreds of thousands of 
chinese with its criticism of official corruption 
why are they doing it now because they have committed crimes 
killed people demonstrating for basic human rights now they are 
trying to console peoples anguish said jie hu a northwestern 
university student 
they control everything the economy the daily lives of the 
people and whats in their minds said jie who is from the 
szechuan province in central china its absolute corruption 
there is no way they can cure this without reforming the system 
wuer was one of six dissident leaders who attended the opening 
ceremony all fled china and later surfaced in paris where they 
have been trying to rally worldwide support for the prodemocracy 
movement in their homeland 
prodemocracy tshirts were hung on the walls of the university 
of illinois building some shirts said you are not alone and 
bore one of the lasting images from the protest the photograph of 
a man standing alone blocking a row of chinese army tanks

in drug users headed for a country music fest in the north woods 
and the trick paid off with 20 arrests 
after posting a sign friday that read narcotics inspection 
ahead six officers in camouflage hid by the roadside 
positioning themselves so they could see the reaction of the people 
in passing vehicles on state route 55 
if the cars slowed down and those inside tried to conceal or 
discard something the officers radioed ahead for patrolmen to pull 
them over said langlade county sheriff dave steger 
some open beer cans were tossed out windows but no one threw 
drugs away one officer told a reporter at the scene 
theyre too expensive he said 
most of the arrests were for marijuana possession and a few 
were for cocaine possession and posession with intent to deliver 
he said 
officers accepted 100 bail in the form of personal checks 
credit cards or cash 
soon after the operation began promoters of the weekend country 
music festival at the mole lake indian reservation about 220 miles 
north of milwaukee arrived at the arrest site a few miles south of 
the reservation to find out what was going on

was good probable cause on all the stops we did make he said

the bush administration is threatening to withhold 
us aid to cambodia if the khmer rouge is given a dominant role in 
a new transitional government 
but the policy paper distributed to reporters today as secretary 
of state james a baker iii arrived here for a 20nation conference 
acknowledged that prince norodom sihanouk might include the group 
whose leaders are accused of murdering more than a million 
cambodians more than a decade ago 
the us would continue to support him the paper said it 
offered the same assurance if sihanouk also gave a role to members 
of provietnam prime minister hun sens government 
sihanouk is recognized by all cambodian factions as the logical 
head of an interim government to be formed after the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops in late september 
the khmer rouge backed by china is one of three factions 
seeking to overthrow the government in pnom penh 
baker in an airborne news conference said the bush 
administration would be willing to make a major effort at 
mobilizing the international community in support of a solution to 
the tragic problem of cambodia 
he said that would include exerting influence on international 
banks to help the countrys rehabilitation after 10 years of civil 
war 
baker said the united states also would be prepared to end its 
support to anticommunist forces in the event of a settlement 
the united states currently is supplying about 3 million to 5 
million a year in nonlethal aid to the guerrillas 
if we could achieve a cessation of external assistance that 
would include external assistance from all sources including any 
external assistance from the united states baker said 
in the conference which opens on sunday baker said his 
objectives included 
an immediate ceasefire 
formation of an interim government headed by sihanouk 
finding a formula to hold free elections 
voluntary return of refugees 
a un supervisory force to monitor the vietnamese withdrawal 
and elections 
the paper on us policy stressed that our strong preference 
would be that there be no khmer rouge participation 
after pledging to support sihanouk even if he gave a role to the 
khmer rouge or hun sens followers the statement added 
we have made it clear however that our ability to support 
any cambodian government is directly and inversely related to the 
degree of khmer rouge participation if any in it 
the paper then went on to declare flatly 
the us cannot accept any role whatsoever in any future 
cambodian government for the khmer rouges leaders discredited 
before the world 
later today baker will meet for two hours with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze who is representing moscow at the 
conference 
baker said the two may begin planning a summit meeting between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
but he said the real preparation will be undertaken when he 
meets with shevardnadze in september 
baker also said he may talk with chinese foreign minister qian 
qichen who will head beijings delegation 
with respect to that issue i would say stay tuned baker 
said 
there will be no formal meeting but baker and qian will be 
seated next to each other under an arrangement made by france 
president bush barred highlevel us visits to china after the 
crackdown last month on students seeking political reforms 
this is being interpreted by the state department as not 
prohibiting such meetings outside china

separating the country from communist north korea the defense 
ministry said 
meanwhile newspapers in tokyo reported today that a chinese 
embassy attache protected by the japanese government while she 
sought asylum left to start a new life in west germany 
ma qiuyun an attache in the embassys visa section went into 
hiding after the june 34 military crackdown on prodemocracy 
protesters in beijing and sought help from the japanese government 
june 14 yomiuri shimbun newspaper said 
it was not known immediately whether the defectors from north 
korea seek asylum for the same reason 
a south korean intelligence source speaking on condition of 
anonymity identified the officer as maj zuo xiukai 40 a member 
of the chinese delegation to the korean military armistice 
commission that oversees the 1953 korean ceasefire 
zuo is the fourthranking officer in the chinese delegation led 
by a brigadier general he said 
defense ministry spokesman brig gen yoon changro said the 
chinese couple remain in protective custody of the americanled 
un command after walking across the border through panmunjom 
truce village this morning 
the senior official from the government national unification 
board did not say whether the defectors seek asylum in south korea 
or a third country such as taiwan seoul has no diplomatic 
relations with beijing but relations between the two recently have 
improved 
the official requesting anonymity said the chinese couple will 
be handed over to south korea soon 
the un command which polices panmunjom consists of 
representatives of the united states and 15 other countries that 
helped south korea drive out invading north koreans in the 195053 
korean war 
china fought with north korea and signed the 1953 ceasefire 
todays defection is the first known chinese defection through 
panmunjom north koreans russians and czechoslovakians have 
defected there 
newspapers in tokyo reported it took the japanese government a 
month to to find a country to shelter ms ma 27 finally west 
germany agreed and lufthansa german airline confirmed she flew to 
frankfurt friday afternoon 
according to mainichi shimbun newspaper ms mas first 
preference was the united states but washington refused 
apparently to avoid worsening relations strained since the us 
embassy in beijing began protecting chinese dissident fang lizhi 
and his wife physics professor li shuxian australia also turned 
down ms ma the tokyo shimbun said 
us embassy officials could not be reached for comment today 
and the newspaper account could not be verified 
the bush administration has offered protection to all chinese 
citizens in the united states and at least two chinese diplomats 
have obtained refuge in the country in june a state department 
spokesman said other chinese officials have asked washington for 
protection but he refused to elaborate 
fang and ms li fled to the us embassy after chinese troops 
marched on unarmed protesters in beijing and killed hundreds 
perhaps thousands china says only 100 civilians and nearly 100 
soldiers and police died

the ailing exxon valdez limped toward safe 
harbor today after postponing massive hull repairs for weeks while 
waiting offshore until environmental questions could be answered 
the tanker involved in the nations worst oil spill was 
scheduled to enter san diego bay early sunday under tow as it has 
been throughout the 2500mile journey south from alaska 
divers were confident they had cut off all the dangling steel 
plates torn loose during the southerly voyage and that the gutted 
tanker would be able to pass through the harbors shallows 
state environment officials said they would keep close watch on 
the lumbering ship when it enters the bay under escort surrounded 
by a flotilla of us coast guard boats 
local greenpeace activists said theyd be watching too 
following at a distance after staging a protest demonstration 
against exxon planned for sunday morning 
we are concerned that it will be discharging into the san 
diego bay said rick nadeau director of greenpeace in san diego 
if it does have some oil slicks coming out of it well be able 
to see that 
nadeau said greenpeace wants to see the valdez reach the dock 
safely because more environmental damage could occur if the tanker 
remains at sea any longer 
an 18mile oil slick was spotted near the tanker july 10 and 
since then the valdez has been halted about 55 miles off the coast 
of san diego 
numerous tests were conducted and the emergency platecutting 
work was undertaken exxon officials and state negotiators hammered 
out an agreement to allow valdez into port 
the valdez which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after 
slamming into a submerged reef in alaska was to execute a series 
of maneuvers simulating what it will have to do inside the harbor 
before being allowed into the bay 
exxon officials insist that periodict discharges from the valdez 
are nontoxic with barely detectable traces of oil state officials 
leery of exxon assurances have said the ship is releasing 
significant pollutants

syrian and christian forces kept up their 
relentless rocket attacks in beirut today killing eight people and 
wounding 42 in a wave of bloodshed that has driven out all but a 
fraction of the populace police said 
fires blazed out of control and palls of thick black smoke 
billowed from gaping holes that rockets and shells made in 
apartment buildings in both moslem and christian sectors 
the new casualties raised the overall toll to 502 killed and 
2056 wounded in the 19week confrontation between christian forces 
and syrian army gunners 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under regulations 
estimated that only about 250000 people remain in the city that 
was home to an estimated 15 million residents when the current 
fighting broke out march 8 
the spokesman said about 50 percent of the population fled in 
the first three months of the fighting and about 350000 people 
have fled in the past 10 days 
most of beiruts residents have fled to south lebanon the 
eastern bekaa valley and the mountain resorts northeast of the city 
to escape the deadly shelling duels the spokesman said 
moslem and christian radio stations interrupted regular 
programming early in the day to report that shelling duels were 
continuing across a mountain range southeast of the capital 
the fight started very early today the moslemrun voice of 
the nation radio reported in a news flash 
the christiancontrolled voice of lebanon radio urged civilians 
to take maximum precaution because the shelling might escalate 
and spread to other areas 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across the wooded hills 
south of beirut early in the day as syrian army gunners pounded the 
christian suburb of baabda east of the capital 
baabda houses the presidential palace that has been used as the 
main headquarters for christian army commander gen michel aoun 
since the confrontation broke out 
several motorists heading to beirut to inspect their deserted 
apartments and businesses turned back to south lebanon and other 
safe areas to avoid being caught in the crossfire 
theyre shelling his palace hell respond soon i dont want 
to be around when his response starts said marwan shaar a sunni 
moslem who owns a money exchange company 
shaar spoke in the syrianpoliced khaldeh area seven miles 
south of beirut the area was under fierce shelling from aouns 
gunners overnight 
the escalating shelling duels coincided with reports in 
lebanons heated rumor mill that either aoun or the syrians would 
have to storm their opponents positions to break out of the 
4month shelling duel that has not altered either sides areas of 
influence 
aoun in an interview with the weekly arab and international 
annahar pledged that we shall be advancing against the occupied 
areas he did not elaborate 
the 54yearold maronite general had declared a war of 
liberation against syrias 40000 troops deployed in 
predominantly moslem sections of lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league 
he made the move after the syrians and allied forces besieged 
his 310squaremile christian enclave northeast of beirut in 
retaliation for his blockade of ports run by syrianbacked militias 
south of the capital

the government said thousands of 
indian troops would begin leaving today the second anniversary of 
an accord that brought them to sri lanka to quell a rebellion but 
instead fueled more violence 
india agreed on friday to resume withdrawing its 45000 
peacekeeping troops averting a showdown with sri lanka president 
ranasinghe premadasa who had called the continued troop presence a 
threat to his countrys independence 
the government said 3000 to 4000 troops would begin leaving 
today 
the indosri lanka problem to a great extent has been 
resolved foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said before he and a 
sixmember delegation left for new delhi to discuss a timetable for 
the withdrawal of the rest of the indian troops 
indias decision to recommence the withdrawal process has 
further consolidated the 2500yearold friendship between the two 
countries he said 
premadasa originally sought the departure of all indian troops 
by today but india maintained an immediate withdrawal would worsen 
ethnic violence 
indias decision friday came on one of the most violent days 
when 74 people were killed 
casualties included nine tamil guerrillas killed friday in two 
separate clashes with indian troops according to military 
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
state television said most victims were killed by sri lankan 
forces in the sinhalese heartland where extremists have violently 
protested government peace efforts and where indian forces are not 
deployed 
the military also announced at least 150 people have died since 
the government declared a nationwide curfew from midnight thursday 
to 6 am sunday to prevent violence during the anniversary 
the twoyear indian military presence has fueled ethnic violence 
among tamil guerrillas the indians were supposed to disarm and 
sinhalese extremists who say the indian presence violates sri 
lankan sovereignty 
india spurred by its own politically powerful tamil ethnic 
minority of 60 million sent troops to sri lanka to enforce a july 
29 1987 peace accord sponsored by india and designed to give 
ethnic tamils some autonomy in northern and eastern sri lanka 
but the biggest tamil guerrilla group the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam reneged and began attacking the indians 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who comprise 
75 percent of the population and control the government and armed 
forces 
sinhalese extremists upset with the concessions made to tamils 
meanwhile began attacking moderate sinhalese who supported the 
peace overtures 
sinhalese radicals are accused of killing 4000 people mostly 
sinhalese government officials and supporters since indian troops 
began arriving 
another 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
died in the tamil separatist war that started in 1983 
in washington the bush administration said it hopes new delhis 
decision saves lives 
we welcome this development and hope that india and sri lanka 
will be successful in reaching an agreement on a timetable for 
withdrawal that minimizes bloodshed while recognizing sri lankas 
sovereignty and independence said state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
it remained unclear when all of the indian troops would leave 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne and six other sri lankan 
officials were to fly to new delhi on friday to discuss a timetable 
for the withdrawal of the rest of the indian troops 
premadasa earlier said sri lankan troops would leave the 
barracks where they have been confined for two years and resume 
patrols in tamil areas 
at the peak of its involvement in sri lanka indias 
peacekeeping force numbered at least 70000 the most recent 
withdrawals were in january and february when about 5000 soldiers 
left shortly after premadasa took office

about 250 reformminded lawmakers held a strategy 
meeting today for what promises to become the national parliaments 
first organized opposition in nearly 70 years 
the fledgling faction of soviet legislators operating under the 
bland title of the interregional deputies group is pushing 
for more radical economic reform and greater democracy 
progressive economist gavriil popov opened the groups first 
general meeting in the crowded auditorium of the soviet filmmakers 
union with a call to bring reform through careful legal changes 
instead of the governments spontaneous approach to crisis 
after crisis 
speakers then began discussing amendments and projects they want 
to lobby for in the supreme soviet legislature 
organizers said many more than the 250 deputies who registered 
for the twoday general meeting wanted to come but some could not 
obtain tickets and others were too involved in local events all 
2250 deputies elected to this springs congress of peoples 
deputies were eligible to join 
tass which dubbed the group leftradicals said today they 
have a place in the reform process but that some legislators have 
expressed the fear that in this complex time for the country when 
unity of action is required this leftradical group might turn 
into some kind of opposition 
in fact some members say the group already sees itself as an 
opposition faction but avoids saying so publicly 
were avoiding the words opposition and faction because 
theyre perceived negatively moscow deputy yuri andreyev said in 
an interview but in actuality this is a group of opposition 
deputies who want to work in an organized way at the congress and 
the supreme soviet 
moscow deputy sergei stankevich writing in the first issue of 
the groups newspaper the peoples deputy said that fears 
instilled by years of political tyranny made people shy away from 
the idea of open opposition 
no sooner does someone pronounce the words faction and 
opposition from the rostrum than some people feel their hearts 
drop into their feet and their backs break out in sweat and others 
get a hunters spark in their eyes and a militant shout in their 
throats he wrote 
tass predicted that maverick communist boris n yeltsin would be 
elected head of the interregional group elections were to be held 
on sunday 
thus far the group has been tolerated but given no concrete 
support by the government apparatus and was denied its own meeting 
place in the kremlin organizers said 
it is working on setting up its own staff and support base said 
elena kotova head of the twoweekold foundation of deputies 
initiatives 
the foundation is searching for legal ways for voters to 
contribute money to their deputies and also hopes to act as a data 
bank and channel for voters requests kotova said 
our desired aim is to have the equivalent of a western 
party she said 
the last alternative party to survive the bolshevik purges the 
left socialist revolutionaries was suppressed in 1922 
the interregional group grew out of the despair of the 
radicallyinclined minority during the congress when they found 
virtually all their motions blocked by what one deputy called the 
aggressively obedient majority the newspaper peoples deputy 
said 
popov proposed creation of an independent group of deputies on 
may 27 the third day of the congress the congress lasted two 
weeks it served as a national stage for striking revelations about 
the countrys crises and launched commissions but produced little 
actual legislation 
the congress postponed the resolution of essential problems 
for an undefined period the peoples deputy said and that led 
to strikes and the sharpening of the interethnic situation 
among questions discussed today were amendments that would give 
enterprises more independence from ministries and a resolution 
asking that soviets living abroad who were stripped of their 
citizenship be allowed to reclaim it

hungary has dismantled nearly half of 
the barbed wire fence and alarm system that has divided this 
communist nation from the west for more than 30 years an official 
said 
balazs novaki deputy commander in chief of the hungarian 
frontier guards told reporters on friday that work on removing 
hungarys iron curtain has progressed more swiftly than planned 
hungarian leaders presented president bush with a piece of the 
barbed wire fence when he visited budapest earlier this month 
speaking at a news conference at the border town of koeszeg 
novaki said the system now has been removed from a 75mile section 
of hungarys 160mile border with neutral austria the official mti 
news agency reported 
during the spring workers began cutting through the barbed wire 
at four stops along the border and officials said then they 
expected to dismantle the barrier completely by dec 1 1990 
hungary decided in february to remove the fence and electronic 
alarm system that was installed in 1972 novaki said restrictions 
in the 15milewide border zone such as on travel and movement 
will be lifted aug 1 but that guards will continue to patrol the 
border 
the number of western tourists visiting hungary has increased 
considerably this year novaki said with the biggest increases 
among visitors from austria west germany the netherlands and the 
united states 
officials also have said there has been a substantial increase 
in the number of citizens from other east bloc countries attempting 
to flee to the west over the hungarian border since they began 
dismantling the fence most are from east germany officials have 
said

the hearst corp has put the los angeles 
herald examiner up for sale one of the newspapers editors said 
the announcement which according to features editor andrea 
herman was made to employees on friday followed months of reports 
the owners were holding discussions with potential buyers of the 
moneylosing paper 
the reason was not publicly announced but a statement to 
newspaper employees said the decision was a result of intense 
pressure from competitors of the afternoon paper 
for a number of years the herald examiner has been in an 
extremely challenging situation said the statement by robert j 
danzig vice president and general manager of herald newspapers 
we have weighed these considerations carefully and have 
reached a conclusion that continuing our ownership of the herald 
examiner is not compatible with the strategic direction of our 
newspaper company danzig said 
the hearst corp a privately held company has acknowledged the 
paper loses money but wont disclose figures 
in recent years the newspaper has lost readers to the rival los 
angeles times as well as to growing suburban newspapers but with a 
circulation of 238392 daily and 183122 on sunday the herald 
examiner still is the 42nd largest newspaper in the country ms 
herman said 
daily circulation peaked at 729000 in 1967 when the herald 
examiner was the nations largest afternoon daily 
the beginning of the circulation decline coincided with the 
start of a 10year strike by the newspaper guild afternoon 
newspapers across the country have been hurt by the growth of 
suburbs because delivery is hampered by traffic 
still the herald examiner has earned a reputation as a scrappy 
newspaper that provides vigorous coverage of the nations 
secondlargest city 
the newspaper was the first to delve into the financial dealings 
of mayor tom bradley and its queries into the fiveterm mayors 
ties with a commercial bank prompted this weeks city council 
hearings into a controversial deposit of 2 million in city funds 
with the bank 
hearst hired the investment banking firm of lazard freres amp co 
of new york to handle sale negotiations according to the 
announcement given to newspaper employees 
the newspaper has 760 editorial and administrative employees

as thousands of people milled through a 
sunsplashed street fair a mental patient who had walked away from 
a hosptial attacked a 9yearold girl and stabbed her to death in 
front of her mother 
jessica short was pronounced dead about a half hour after the 
220 pm attack friday a hospital spokesman said 
a young life was wasted and i want to know why mayor 
sebastian j garafalo said at a news conference i keep asking 
why its so senseless 
david peterson 37 a patient at connecticut valley hospital 
was charged with murder in what police chief george r aylward 
called a random act of violence 
peterson had been ordered confined at the hospital for 15 years 
in may 1988 after being found innocent by reason of insanity on 
assault and burglary charges said martha lewis executive director 
of the state psychiatric security review board which oversees his 
confinement 
aylward said he had been told by the hospital that peterson was 
free on an eighthour pass friday hospital superintendent carl 
cappello however denied that peterson had been given a pass and 
said he simply walked off the grounds without permission 
peterson had been granted privileges to go to the library and 
stay in the building cappello said he went awol 
we dont have a fence around the hospital cappello said 
its not a correctional facility he was obviously able to 
leave the grounds 
lewis was unsure of the exact nature of petersons mental 
illness 
the stabbing took place on the citys main street which was 
closed to traffic 
peterson grabbed short from behind after she walked out of an 
fw woolworth co store and was apparently walking toward her 
mother he flailed at her head and chest with a large 
blackhandled hunting knife witnesses said until two police 
officers and a passerby pulled him off the girl 
nobody was helping her said a woman who would not give her 
name people were screaming and running he cut her on the arm 
and then just stood there and started stabbing her in the chest 
lewis said peterson was allowed to leave the hospital to have 
christmas dinner with his family last year but she said that was 
the only time the review board has allowed him to leave the 
hospital grounds 
it definitely calls for a review to look into what happened 
she said

hashemi rafsanjani won irans presidential 
election by a landslide and constitutional changes also approved 
by voters will give him sweeping powers according to partial 
returns today 
rafsanjani 54 who was serving as parliament speaker and 
commander in chief is expected to restore links with the west 
liberalize irans economy and soften the hardline policies of the 
late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the government reported a huge voter turnout and a powerful 
mandate for rafsanjani who recently emerged as irans most popular 
and powerful leader 
an opposition group charged that voting hours were extended in 
an effort to increase a poor turnout of voters and that troops 
attacked some voters 
partial returns gave rafsanjani 94 percent of the vote in 124 
districts counted according to the official islamic republic news 
agency it said he captured 8 million of 85 million votes tallied 
so far from fridays polling 
public opinion polls published earlier this month predicted 86 
percent of the votes for rafsanjani and 11 percent for his 
opponent abass sheibani three percent were expected not to vote 
sheibani a 58yearold parliament deputy from tehran has no 
national political power base the lawmaker a candidate in the 
1981 presidential race was a student activist opposed to the late 
shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
sheibani spent 13 years in prison before khomeinis islamic 
revolution toppled the monarchy in 1979 khomeini died june 3 
the official news agency also citing partial returns said 97 
percent of voters approved constitutional amendments in a 
referendum held with the presidential elections 
the consitutional changes give rafsanjani more power than any of 
his predecessors in addition to scrapping the post of prime 
minister they put the president in charge of government he will 
be answerable only to the 270seat majlis or parliament 
the changes are designed to eliminate competing power centers 
that have for years paralyzed the government and blocked economic 
reform 
irans main opposition group the mujahedeen khalq or peoples 
warriors said in a sattement released at its headquarters in 
baghdad iraq that the voter turnout was very poor 
it gave no overall numbers but it said that at some polling 
stations in tehran only 1000 of 5000 expected voters cast ballots 
voting hours were extended by seven hours the government said 
the extension was made to accommodate a large turnout of voters 
but the opposition group claimed it was actually intended to bring 
forth more of them 
reporters said the turnout seemed sluggish friday morning but 
picked up later in the day 
the way they have been urging people to get out and vote has 
been very desperate a mujahedeen spokesman said in a telephone 
interview with the associated press in nicosia cyprus 
the group also claimed that at polling stations in ghani abad 
and shahreray in south tehran fundamentalist revolutionary 
guards beat up some voters and arrested others who tried to vote 
against the constitutional amendments there was no independent 
confirmation 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi said in a television 
interview that his security agencies had foiled plots by opposition 
groups backed by global arrogance to disrupt the voting he did 
not elaborate global arrogance is an iranian epithet for the 
united states and its allies 
although it was a foregone conclusion rafsanjanis victory 
reflected even stronger support than expected the official news 
agency said this massive victory will give greater confidence to 
his adminstration 
almost every voter questioned friday by correspondents outside 
polling stations in tehran said they chose rafsanjani because they 
believed he would put the economy before revolutionary ideology 
we know rafsanjani cant perform miracles but we feel hes 
the only man who can improve things engineer parzolah armandi 
said after voting in tehrans southern slums 
were tired of lining up for food said masoumeh gazian a 
housewife in the nehdat islami district who said she voted for 
rafsanjani 
rafsanjani leader of the socalled pragmatists in irans 
religious hierarchy will be the islamic republics fourth 
president he will succeed ayatollah ali khamenei who was chosen 
supreme leader after khomeinis death 
khamenei is rafsanjanis main ally in the power struggle between 
the pragmatists and radicals led by mohtashemi 
mohtashemis allies include prime minister hussein musavi whose 
job will be eliminated under the constitutional amendments

did not know how he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen which 
doctors noticed after his rescue he was released from a hospital

with two major crashes in nine days a rash of 
worrisome incidents and a troubled history talk of eight million 
hours of safe flying isnt enough to calm renewed concern about 
safety of the dc10 
an airline passengers group wants all of the more than 450 
triplejet dc10s grounded and safety groups are calling for 
design changes 
but federal officials and some aviation experts say the planes 
bad reputation is a bad rap they say the airliner has proved 
itself safe 
as the national transportation safety board tries to find what 
caused the july 19 crash of a united airlines dc10 at sioux city 
iowa that killed 111 people and south korean investigators probe 
the wreckage of a korea air dc10 in tripoli that killed at least 
75 people on thursday 50 airlines around the world are still 
flying dc10s 
other recent incidents involving the widebodied airliner built 
by mcdonnell douglas include 
a canadian airlines model that lost a wheel but landed safely 
in toronto 
a united plane that landed without incident in los angeles 
after reporting hydraulic problems 
another united jet that made an unscheduled stop at chicago 
after a bird was sucked into an engine 
yet another united dc10 that slid off a runway in chicago a 
day before the iowa crash 
although none of the incidents caused injury or serious damage 
they have added to the aura of distrust around the jumbo airliner 
that has been in service nearly two decades and carried 745 million 
passengers 
the question of whether the dc10 is a safe aircraft naturally 
pops into peoples minds said new york aviation attorney james 
l stengel but people who understand the sequence of events in 
the iowa crash understand it was probably a very very rare 
catastrophic incident 
despite reassurances from the experts and from transportation 
secretary samuel skinner who last week declared the dc10 safe 
the airliner has become the butt of jokes loose talk and some 
genuine concerns 
travel agents say that since the iowa crash more passengers are 
choosey about what plane they fly and some want to sit in sections 
where most of the 185 survivors of flight 232 sat 
a reservations clerk speaking on condition that neither she nor 
her airline be identified said some customers joke about the 
dc10 one man suggested he might book his motherinlaw on one 
she said 
rep douglas applegate dohio prompted laughter during 
congressional debate friday when he remarked about a colleague 
concerned with smoking on airliners this issue may be the least 
of his problems if hes flying a dc10 
but aviation experts say the problems facing the airliner are 
not amusing and are typical of the concerns raised in the public 
mind after a serious crash or series of crashes even when they are 
later blamed on maintenance pilot error or other problems 
unrelated to safety of the airliner itself 
tim cole a washington aviation consultant said he would still 
fly in dc10s 
eight million hours without a problem is a much higher 
guarantee than i could get on any new car right now he said 
according to mcdonnell douglas a london insurance analyst said 
that prior to the iowa accident dc10s had flown 8 million hours 
without an accident 
flying safety is serious business and deserves responsible 
treatment said morten beyer chairman of avmart an independent 
aviation appraisal firm 
beyer questioned the conclusions and data of the international 
airline passengers association which called last week for all 
dc10s to be grounded the group which claims 110000 members 
said 17 dc10s have been destroyed since the model was introduced 
in 1970 a worse record than other widebodied airliners 
beyer said the figures are misleading he said 18 dc10s 
actually have been destroyed but only three were due to accidents 
involving mechanical problems 
these include the iowa crash where investigators are trying to 
determine why the planes tail engine blew up destroying hydraulic 
flight controls 
another involved an american airlines dc10 that crashed on 
takeoff from chicago in 1979 becoming what is still the worst us 
aviation disaster in history with 274 people killed the crash was 
blamed on faulty maintenance 
also in 1974 a turkish airlines dc10 crashed over paris 
killing 346 people after a cargo door popped off the cabin 
decompressurized the cargo hold roof buckled and control lines 
were severed 
a court order grounded all dc10s for 37 days after the 1979 
chicago crash and the aircraft was modified for safety after both 
the paris and chicago crashes 
but beyer said 15 other dc10s were destroyed by ground fires 
an aborted takeoff bad landings other pilot errors or birds in an 
engine 
among more recent concerns raised about dc10s is rep john 
dingells suggestion that spare military parts might have been used 
in the engine of the dc10 that crashed in iowa the engine 
builder general electric says this is impossible but the 
michigan democrat asked the federal aviation administration to 
investigate 
adding further to mcdonnell douglass woes is a report last week 
of sabotage of some new airliners at its factory in long beach 
calif including severing of the hydraulic system on an assembly 
line company officials said the incidents were not related to the 
dc10 crash but they were investigating 
neither dc10 that crashed recently was very old in aircraft 
terms but the dc10 is receiving increased scrutiny as the whole 
fleet ages 
older boeingbuilt jetliners already have been subjected to 
mandatory government repairs as they age the focus will switch to 
mcdonnell douglas planes as an industry task force prepares 
recommendations for similar orders applying to the dc10 and other 
planes built by the company 
the dc10 is no longer in production it is to be replaced by 
mcdonnell douglas new md11 model which has yet to leave the 
factory

the rainy season has hit southern sudan 
and a relief operation intended to get food to the region is behind 
schedule and hindered by soggy roads and fears of rebel attacks 
in kosti south of khartoum 17500 tons of emergency supplies 
are just now being loaded on nile river barges that were to have 
gone south weeks ago 
boxcars loaded with 1350 tons of other supplies are parked in a 
railroad yard immovable for fear the train will be attacked by 
rebels or starving peasants as previous ones were 
while nearly threefourths of the targeted 105000 tons reached 
redistribution points before the rains which will make them 
inaccessible relief workers say pockets of potential starvation 
remain in southern sudan an area the size of texas 
one cannot speak of a disaster for the moment but some of 
these areas will have trouble said francis junod of the 
international committee of the red cross the extent depends on 
the ecological situation and the peace talks 
operation lifeline sudan coordinated by the united nations and 
using trucks trains and barges was to have provided enough 
supplies to help people displaced by the southern civil war survive 
the summer monsoonlike rains 
officials report that 72000 tons have been moved the red cross 
mounted a smaller airborne operation that failed to meet its goal 
transporting 6000 tons of a planned 7000 to 8000 tons 
the situation in the rebelheld territories is a bit tricky 
junod said weve not been able to send in enough food because of 
the onset of the rains 
trucks and trains are virtually useless in the rainy season 
neither the railroad bed nor the roads in the south mostly rutted 
pathways are constructed well enough to withstand the downpours 
in 1988 un officials say 250000 southerners died of 
starvation flood or disease during the rainy season the estimate 
of some western relief workers is twice that 
both un and other relief officials said operation lifeline had 
to succeed to save 100000 people from starving to death this 
summer 
some relief workers in this wretchedly poor country africas 
largest with only a tiny network of roads and railways blame 
mismanagement and lack of clear planning for the failure of both 
the un and red cross efforts to reach their goals despite the 
huge expenditures 
the red cross airlift cost 35 million from december when it 
began to june 
operation lifeline sudan which began april 1 was scheduled to 
cost 132 million which donors pledged at a march conference in 
khartoum james p grant the un secretarygenerals special 
representative for the project announced in midjuly a need for an 
additional 40 million with previous increases that brought the 
total to 200 million 
both sides in the civil war generally have honored a ceasefire 
since may but unknown gunmen have attacked relief trucks and 
trains with 11 people killed and several boxcars looted 
a 45car train loaded with 1350 tons of relief supplies was to 
have left july 17 from babanousa in southern kordofan north of the 
war zone en route to aweil a major center for displaced people in 
the south 
days later a un official said the train would not leave 
without assurances from the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
that it would not be attacked the train is to carry food and 
medicines to places held by both the rebels and the government 
politics also have interfered with the relief operation 
operations were suspended temporarily after a military coup june 30 
ousted the civilian government of prime minister sadek elmahdi 
the united nations grant said the new leader lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir took great pains to reaffirm the support of the new 
government to continuing operation lifeline sudan 
the government previously put obstacles in the way claiming 
agencies wanted to feed rebels trying to take over sudan 
rebel commanders also have used food as a weapon even shooting 
at relief planes flying into rebel areas

the countrys largest illegal poppy field 
has been discovered near a hospital that treats drug addicts news 
reports said saturday 
about 1000 opiumproducing poppies used to make heroin and 
morphine were found friday after a nurse not realizing what they 
were picked some to decorate a room at oslos gaustad hospital 
the verdens gang daily newspaper reported 
another nurse recognized the flowers and called police who 
destroyed the welltended field said the paper 
chief nurse annelise bergenheim told the paper that the 
hospital patients who are closely supervised could not have 
tended the field unless they worked at night wearing miners 
lamps 
the flowers usually grow in warmer climates but they can also 
thrive during norways short growing season 
police said they had no idea who planted the flowers

president bush and congressional democrats are 
engaged in a game of chicken over how to finance the 
multibilliondollar bailout of hundreds of failed savings 
institutions 
on friday the squawking began 
bush and members of congress paraded before television cameras 
at three separate news conferences to outline their views one day 
after house and senate negotiators sealed a compromise deal on the 
landmark legislation 
the president favors a complex scheme to pay for the bailout by 
borrowing the money through a new quasiprivate agency that has 
the advantage of keeping 50 billion in sampl spending out of the 
budget deficit which if it goes too high triggers automatic 
spending cuts under the grammrudman law 
democrats support the plan adopted by the housesenate 
conference which they say is cheaper and more honest to borrow 
the money through the treasury department however that would 
balloon the deficit over the next three years democrats evade the 
automatic spending cuts by simply waiving grammrudman 
republicans say the administrations method keeps the spending 
discipline of grammrudman in place democrats say bush is just 
engaging in a more subtle kind of subterfuge 
both agree that the other side is holding up urgent legislation 
needed to staunch the industrys hemorrhaging and neither wants to 
be blamed for that 
the stakes are high sampls are losing an estimated 20 million a 
day 833333 an hour 13888 a minute and 23148 a second 
thats a lot of blame to shoulder and it hardly seems worth it for 
either side to get tarred over what at first glance seems like 
nothing more than an accounting question 
but the issue is important not now but over the next several 
years because it will have a major role in the annual jousting 
over how to balance the budget through spending cuts or tax 
increases 
even though both plans alleviate the danger of an automatic 
spending cut politically their effect couldnt be more different 
democrats are betting that if they win on sampl spending and the 
reported budget deficit approaches the record set during the reagan 
years instead of getting better bush wont be willing to endure 
the kind of drastic spending cuts that would be needed to reduce it 
they believe he will feel that much more pressure to abandon his 
read my lips no new taxes pledge repeated over and over during 
the 1988 campaign 
the issue comes to a head this week when the sampl compromise 
package reaches the full house and senate which must approve it 
before it goes to bush for his signature 
sen phil gramm rtexas has vowed unless god palsies my 
voice to protect the deficitreduction law that bears his name 
gramm has the signatures of 41 senators including his own 
pledging to reject the sampl compromise under the senates rules 
thats enough to block it 
on the other hand if gramm is successful the legislation 
bounces back to the housesenate conference where majority 
democrats prevail 
so the two sides are locked in a stalemate either can tie up 
the legislation but neither has the stomach to do that for very 
long 
the winner likely will be the side that is most successful at 
blaming the other for delay expect the squawking to grow louder

an economic slump since the palestinian 
uprising and the governments increased interest in the occupied 
lands have left this desert town and others like it with soaring 
unemployment and the threat of unrest 
it has become a catastrophe unemployment is a time bomb in 
this town said rahel messika director of the government 
employment agency in yeroham a cluster of neglected tenements 
housing 7000 people in the negev desert 90 miles south of 
jerusalem 
analysts say high unemployment in small towns may cause tension 
between rich and poor and between jews of european and middle 
eastern origin it also could harden antiarab sentiment among 
israeli jews who believe palestinians working for lower wages are 
stealing their jobs 
in yeroham the only activity at midmorning on a summer weekday 
is at the unemployment office where the jobless come looking for 
work they know does not exist idle middleaged men seek relief in 
the shade next to empty cafes and grocery stores 
yeroham was founded in the 1950s to house impoverished 
immigrants as part of an effort by the late prime minister david 
bengurion to develop the negev desert 
the town has relied on a bottle factory and two metalworks but 
the plants have laid off 150 of the towns 2000 workers and 
unemployment is officially pegged at 10 percent 
at least an additional 10 percent dont bother to register any 
more they know no new offers have come in messika said 
young people recently demobilized from the army are leaving 
yeroham hoping to find work and a more vigorous lifestyle in 
cities such as tel aviv 
the unemployment problem in such towns has become a major focus 
of concern in israel taking precedence in newspapers over the 
19month palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
lands 
last month mayors of 30 development towns chained themselves to 
a fence outside prime minister yitzhak shamirs office to press 
demands for economic aid 
the 97 percent jobless figure for may was a 20year high for 
the jewish state the government estimates that the june figure 
will break a record 10 percent 
ruth klinov a labor relations expert at hebrew university in 
jerusalem said the palestinian uprising which has disrupted the 
construction industry and badly hurt tourism contributed 2 percent 
to the overall unemployment rate 
the histadrut israels trade union federation organized a 
twohour nationwide strike by 12 million workers to protest 
unemployment in late july experts say more strikes may be in the 
offing 
there is a great potential for violence in unemployment which 
may eventually be directed against the histadrut itself if they 
dont get results said noah levinepstein a sociologist at tel 
aviv university 
one sign of the unrest was a wildcat strike by 50 laidoff 
employees of the urdan metalworks in netanya which builds israels 
main battle tank the merkava the workers held their managers 
hostage four hours to protest the dismissal orders 
klinov said as long as the government refuses to bail out 
private companies and maintains a policy of privatizing stateowned 
companies an unemployment rate of at least 10 percent is here to 
stay 
in an effort to halt the growth of unemployment israels 
cabinet approved 1375 million to help create new jobs especially 
in development towns 
like other development towns yeroham was built around light 
industries and was heavily subsidized but in recent years the 
government has cut back support and diverted funds to develop 
settlements in the west bank and gaza strip which got 150 million 
last year 
the result is an economic slowdown that has affected everyone 
from grocery stores to banks 
shalom benvinisti 35 an immigrant from morocco lost his job 
as a bank teller five years ago and has worked temporary jobs to 
support his diabetic wife and three children 
even temporary work vanished two months ago and he now relies 
on unemployment benefits of 450 a month after six months the 
benefit will be cut in half 
my kids know that we cant buy them new clothes or the proper 
school books but they are good about it they dont complain they 
understand how hard it is he said 
benvinisti took a governmentrun training course learning to 
make metal frames for concrete casting but he still cannot find a 
job because they all want years of experience 
yoav peled a political scientist at tel aviv university said a 
survey of 832 israelis in eight development towns indicated high 
unemployment has increased support for extreme antiarab parties 
they feel that the palestinians are forcing wages down and are 
stealing their jobs said peled said 
unemployment is also high among 800000 arabs with israeli 
citizenship in predominantly arab nazareth the official jobless 
rate is 10 percent with an additional 12 percent unregistered 
according to city spokesman fahoum safwan 
high unemployment among arabisraelis will strengthen their 
growing identification with the palestinian uprising as economic 
frustrations are added to political tensions levinepstein said

the recent barring of black teenagers from 
a pool owned by the jaycees resulted from tradition and habit that 
lives on in this small town residents say 
the saluda swim and tennis club capitulated quickly when its 
whitesonly rule was challenged it said it will admit blacks when 
it reopens saturday after reviewing all its policies to ensure they 
are nondiscriminatory 
such change could have occurred only with the involvement of 
outsiders say residents in this town of 3000 40 percent of whom 
are black 
the local jaycees were pressured by their national organization 
after the july 13 incident involving three black teenagers with a 
group of united methodist church members from across the state 
people living in the town knew that the pool was for whites 
black residents swam in ponds and were unwilling to challenge the 
status quo both black and white residents said 
blacks in saluda know whats what said richard logan the 
towns first and only black council member 
at mjs cafe last week charlie mason sat behind a wooden 
picnic table on the right side of the restaurant where he and 
other black residents have sat for years the left side of the 
restaurant which is separated by a wall was patronized by three 
white customers eating lunch 
ive just been sitting on this side all the time mason 58 
said when asked why he restricts himself to one side of the 
restaurant 
the swim club ended its restrictions when threatened with 
eviction by the jaycees but without apparent bitterness 
in 1989 its the moral thing to do club president robert 
booth said 
really everybody treated it as a private membership club as 
any city has country clubs said ralph shealy editor of the 
saluda standardsentinel i hope the whole town is not treated as 
racist 
virginia cobbler who like shealy is white agreed 
we have lived here with it all these years and weve never had 
any problem they call it racism and it gets attention i just hope 
it doesnt create a big problem cobbler 24 referred to blacks 
and whites in saluda as family 
saluda is in rural south carolina 45 miles west of columbia it 
sits in an area known for peaches livestock and textiles stores 
close after lunch on wednesday and the biggest news had been the 
upcoming celebration of saluda as birthplace of alamo heroes 
william barret travis and james butler bonham 
the swim clubs pool policy became the talk of the town though 
after it refused to admit the black church members who were part of 
a group of 66 who had spent the day renovating a dilapidated home 
club officials noted that the pool site was willed to the town 
in 1933 by dairyman george c wheeler with the provision that it be 
used as a recreation area for white people 
in 1955 one year after the us supreme court declared 
unconstitutional separate facilities for blacks and whites the 
town deeded the property to the jaycees with the whitesonly 
provision intact 
the jaycees leased the pool to the private club no blacks ever 
applied for membership booth said 
state law does not address racial segregation in private clubs 
state attorney generals spokesman mark dillard said but lawyers 
say racial covenants are unenforceable 
while some say theyre now reassessing practices and attitudes 
that have lived for years in town others maintain that saludas 
problems are no different from those elsewhere in the country 
racism is all over the united states logan said its the 
same its just done in different ways

two new hud audits say rent subsidies were 
improperly inflated by 6 million for two housing projects 
involving former agency officials 
the internal audits completed this month by the department of 
housing and urban developments inspector general found that local 
housing authorities in tulsa okla and gastonia nc allowed a 
mortgage company to establish the rents for the projects a 
violation of hud guidelines 
the tulsa project windsong apartments is owned by a 
partnership that includes four former hud officials philip winn 
lance wilson philip abrams and j michael queenan all four also 
had stakes in projects reviewed as part of a nationwide audit 
released in april that cited excessive rents as one of several 
problems afflicting the section 8 moderate rehabilitation program 
the gastonia development four seasons apartments is owned by a 
group that hired rhode islandbased consultant judith siegal to 
help obtain the lucrative rehabilitation subsidies 
ms siegal was among the lesserknown but more successful 
consultants cited in the earlier report which found that hud was 
being overcharged more than 400 million over the 15year life of 
the rehabilitation subsidies because of inflated rents 
the mortgage company that established the rents benton mortgage 
co of knoxville tenn also has figured prominently in an ongoing 
investigation of abuses at the agency the company coinsured the 
projects with hud 
all the audits noted that former hud officials had won a 
significant share of the rehabilitation money and that prominent 
republican consultants were successful in steering money to their 
clients 
since the report in april hud has been the subject of internal 
congressional and justice department investigations mismanagement 
and abuses have been found in a number of the multibilliondollar 
agencys programs 
hud secretary jack kemp suspended the moderate rehabilitation 
program the house in its budget bill for hud next year included 
no new funding for the program 
the two new audits obtained last week under the freedom of 
information act were not part of the nationwide review 
the audit of the tulsa project completed july 11 found that 
the tulsa housing authority misinterpreted hud guidelines and 
allowed benton to calculate the rents for the 202unit windsong 
complex 
as a result auditors said hud already had paid more than 
200000 in excess of what it should have since the subsidies began 
in 1987 and could overpay by as much as 34 million over the life 
of the contract unless the subsidies are reduced 
the findings of the gastonia audit completed july 24 were very 
similar 
investigators found that the gastonia housing authority allowed 
benton to set the rents which auditors said were calculated with a 
faulty formula and included ineligible costs as a result hud had 
paid 63000 in excessive subsidies from late 1987 through march 
and over the term of the contract will overpay rents by more than 
25 million unless the subsidies are recalculated 
in both the tulsa and gastonia audits hud urged the local 
housing officials and regional hud officials to recalculate the 
subsidies and to recover the overpaid amounts that process is just 
getting under way

racism permeates the roman catholic church in 
the united states several clerics said warning that more blacks 
could follow the lead of a priest who set up an unauthorized 
african american congregation 
seven black church leaders speaking friday after a national 
conference of black clergy called on the church to address the 
needs of minorities and move blacks to positions of authority 
the church has bought into the racist practices of the 
american culture said the rev victor cohea a pastor from new 
orleans 
the news conference at marquette university followed a joint 
conference of the national black catholic clergy caucus the 
national black sisters conference and the national black catholic 
seminarians association 
much discussed was the case of the rev george a stallings a 
washington dc priest who was suspended for setting up an 
independent africanamerican congregation without permission of his 
archbishop 
the rev albert j mcknight of opelousas la warned that 
others could follow stallings lead 
were ready to take up the cross and commit ourselves to 
change im firmly convinced youre going to see changes 
mcknight said 
there are some of us who are ready to do exactly what george 
stallings did he said 
responding to the criticism the rev joseph perry judicial 
vicar of the milwaukee archdiocese and a member of the clergy 
caucus said he believed those comments would be rather strong 
from my perspective 
over the last 50 years the catholic church has reached out to 
various minority groups perry said 
in my association with many black priests i find them 
extremely loyal to the church and willing to work with the system 
for steady and certain improvement he said 
sister patricia haley of philadelphia said the church must 
include minority group members and women at the highest 
decisionmaking levels of its dioceses 
the manner in which we do business is essentially a racist 
system and weve got to change the system the sister said

irans new president hashemi rafsanjani 
will have to walk a political tightrope to achieve his expected 
goals of rebuilding links with the west and liberalizing life in 
the islamic republic 
he has been armed with more power than any of his three 
predecessors because of constitutional amendments approved in a 
national referendum held alongside fridays presidential election 
the official islamic republic news agency said rafsanjani 
received 94 percent of the 85 million votes counted by saturday 
the constitutional changes received 97 percent support it did not 
say how many people voted 
the leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists will have to move 
carefully to avoid triggering a backlash from radicals dedicated to 
preserving the ideological purity of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
islamic revolution 
under the constitutional reforms initiated by khomeini himself 
before he died june 3 the post of prime minister will be scrapped 
to put the government under the presidency which had been a 
largely ceremonial post 
rafsanjani 54 has authority to appoint or dismiss the cabinet 
he will head a newly formed supreme security council which will 
control irans vast security apparatus and military in addition to 
the economy and planning 
the constitutional amendments are designed to eliminate rival 
power centers that have paralyzed government for years and delayed 
economic and social reforms in theory they should create a more 
cohesive and effective government 
rafsanjani was elected by iranians eager for change after 10 
years of revolutionary turmoil a war with iraq economic hardship 
and the rigid islamic code imposed by khomeini 
voters interviewed in tehran during fridays polling were 
unanimous in saying they were looking to rafsanjani in the 
forefront of khomeinis revolution from the start to improve their 
lot 
but irans 50 million people battered by runaway inflation 
high prices unemployment and shortages of just about everthing 
may be expecting too much too soon 
rafsanjani has sought to dampen expectations saying i will 
try to realize what is practicable 
he underlined in a television interview last week that his hopes 
for a new era may or may not square with the potentials at hand 
rafsanjani has acknowledged he faces daunting problems an 
economy run into the ground by the eightyear iraniraq war poor 
management and a decade of irans selfimposed isolation 
mohammadhassan sazegar deputy minister of heavy industry 
outlined the problems with unusual candor at a seminar on 
industrial problems last month saying the economy is in its worst 
shape ever 
production is lowest in our industries he said 
bottlenecks are strangling production 
sazegar said the 120 factories supervised by his ministry are 
producing at only 30 percent of capacity because of shortages of 
raw materials spare parts and energy 
we frequently prevaricate by resorting to emotional 
sloganeering to solve problems he said for the last 10 years 
we have offered the wrong solutions and weakened the economy 
such frank comments indicate that more realistic thinking is 
emerging in the upper echelons of the leadership than was possible 
while khomeini was alive dominating every aspect of iranian life 
with stern islamic inflexibility 
rafsanjani and his main ally ayatollah ali khamenei who 
replaced khomeini as irans supreme religious leader favor a 
freemarket system to revitalize the economy 
they also know that largescale foreign investment is needed to 
improve the economy and carry out postwar reconstruction and that 
it will come only if relations with the west are restored 
they are opposed by revolutionary hardliners like hussein 
musavi the outgoing prime minister and interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi who say foreign economic participation will 
dilute the revolutions ideological purity 
so far the fractious leadership has displayed unexpected unity 
to ensure a smooth transition of power since khomeini died 
but diplomats and analysts believe that if the radicals perceive 
rafsanjani to be straying from khomeinis ideological legacy they 
will challenge him 
khamenei and rafsanjani have adroitly outmaneuvered the radicals 
in recent weeks 
rafsanjani began moving his allies into positions of influence 
weeks before his election they included rajai khorassani irans 
former us ambassador who ousted hardliner ayatollah sadeq 
khalkhali as chairman of parliaments foreign policy committee 
in foreign policy the new president has reaffirmed that he will 
adhere to khomeinis neither east nor west decree but he has 
stressed we do not want to strain relations with countries which 
would like to have healthy ties with us 
there are indications rafsanjani has begun reactivating his 
efforts to improve relations with the west 
diplomatic sources said rafsanjani is moving to boost relations 
with canada and that khazempour ardebili former deputy oil 
minister is likely to be appointed ambassador there soon 
a canadian delegation visited tehran with little fanfare earlier 
this month to sign an agreement that permits iran to open a 
purchasing office in canada to buy badly needed high technology 
equipment for irans vital oil industry which earns 95 percent of 
the countrys foreign exchange

six months after president bushs inaugural 
speech offering the hand of bipartisanship to congress house 
democrats say the honeymoon is on the rocks 
perhaps the low point in the relationship came late last week 
when the democratcontrolled house hammered the administration on 
its defense plans by slashing weapons systems bush favored and 
adding some he didnt 
but it had been deteriorating for weeks as the white house 
negotiated positions with congressional democrats on a wide range 
of issues and courted their votes only to have republican lawmakers 
and campaign operatives later undermine the agreements 
democrats complained that bush was playing a public good guy 
role calling for political peace and harmony while privately 
signaling his gop troops to attack from the rear 
i think the president is going to find his good will here is 
going to diminish said rep sander levin dmich thats not a 
threat its just a reality 
particularly galling to house leaders has been bushs eagerness 
to seek an amendment to the constitution against flag desecration 
to counter a recent supreme court decision and his use of a speech 
at the iwo jima memorial to put pressure on congress to act 
they also believe that bush has been busily making expensive 
promises from a 100 million development program for poland to a 
capital gains tax break and a manned mission to mars then handing 
congress the bills to pay 
in remarkably candid comments last week house minority leader 
robert michel rill indicated that white house chief of staff 
john sununu was indeed fully involved in the strategy to develop 
the wedge issues such as the flag that would put democrats on the 
defensive 
that does not bode well for a bipartisan working relationship 
with the new democratic leadership team in the house said rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the partys house campaign 
organization 
you cant look for wedge issues and still look for 
cooperation in a democraticcontrolled congress anthony said 
adding that the result would be legislative stalemate and in a 
stalemated government its always the president whos hurt 
we believe theres a pattern said rep steny hoyer dmd 
chairman of the house democratic caucus the president says nice 
things and on the other hand john sununu says use this as a wedge 
issue theyre talking out of two sides of their mouth 
a possible victim of the ill will could be the hopedfor 
agreement between bush and congress on a fiscal year 1991 budget 
outline talk of reaching such an accord early is no longer heard 
and speaker thomas s foley dwash hinted recently that it could 
be abandoned entirely 
bush continued to insist friday that he is not looking for a 
fight with congress and will continue to be conciliatory 
i have to work with these people the president said i 
have never been too hot at being a namecaller 
but democrats seem increasingly less willing to take such 
comments at face value 
bush wants kinder and gentler while his people are gnawing 
your legs off said rep byron dorgan dnd 
proponents of the wedge strategy from sununu to house gop whip 
newt gingrich of georgia and edward rollins chairman of the 
national republican congressional committee have absolutely no 
interest in anything except burning the barn down he said if 
bush is going to have a twotrack system thats not going to 
work what track is the president on 
more than 80 democrats expressed a similar sentiment on friday 
complaining to bush in a letter that rollins organization took 
more than 20 of them to task in news releases for supporting the 
presidents position against random drug testing for state 
department employees in a floor vote last month 
it was a difficult political vote for those of us who care 
about the war on drugs said rep peter hoagland dneb one of 
the victims of the press releases its just inexcusable 
another signer of the letter rep richard stallings didaho 
recalled bushs inaugural statement that the american people 
await action they didnt send us here to bicker they ask us to 
rise above the merely partisan 
that was the line that got the best response in the january 
speech he said but its become a oneway street as i see it 
and what will happen is well stop supporting him and theyll wind 
up with a lot of problems that will be of their own making

a house committee tacked an extra 200000 on 
next years appropriation for care of the government mansion 
occupied by vice president dan quayle as the result of some sharp 
lobbying by his wife the congressional quarterly reported saturday 
when marilyn quayle decided she wanted to convert space on the 
third floor into bedrooms for her three young children she turned 
not to budget director richard g darman but to aubrey a tex 
gunnels a powerful aide to the subcommittee which has funding 
jurisdiction over the executive office of the president the 
magazine said 
and that is why the 184 billion treasury department and postal 
service spending bill approved tuesday by the full house 
appropriations committee contains 578000 for the care 
maintenance and operation of the vice presidents residence 
more than twice last years figure and 200000 more than requested 
by the white house the article said 
gunnels is staff director of the appropriations subcommittee on 
the treasury postal service and general government whose chairman 
is rep edward r roybal dcalif gunnels has worked on capitol 
hill since 1958 
the magazine said that at marilyn quayles personal invitation 
the 71yearold native of lubbock texas visited the mansion last 
spring to review her plans for installing several new bedrooms and 
a bath in a thirdfloor area now used for storage 
mrs quayle declined to comment on the visit but her chief of 
staff denise balzano said that while the vice presidents wife had 
outlined her ideas for the space she had made no formal request 
for extra funds in the wake of the house committees action it 
looks like gunnels has been helpful ms balzano said 
gunnels declined to discuss his role just say that the 
committee was informed that the vice presidents residence needs 
some more bedrooms he told the magazine 
roybal said that had i gone out to see the mansion i would 
have recommended it myself 
the 96yearold queen annestyle residence is on the lush 
treelined grounds of the naval observatory about two miles from 
the white house formerly the quarters of the chief of naval 
operations it became the official residence of the vice president 
in 1974

the judicial system is struggling with 
communications and legal challenges in trying three deaf men 
charged with murdering a service station attendant in 1976 
police and prosecutors have used signlanguage interpreters to 
communicate with the defendants but one defense attorney says that 
may be inadequate to convey the nuances of court testimony and 
crossexamination 
sign language isnt even satisfactory for friendly meetings with 
her client said tricia jenkins a public defender 
theres always the fear that he doesnt understand she said 
last week 
the case involves the slaying of franklin deland simpson a 
service station attendant in marion county who was killed in a 
feb 3 1976 holdup that netted the bandits 100 to 200 cash 
ricki joe rodgers 35 of lakeland larry bernard elliott 35 
of st augustine and roger gary smith 39 of huntsville ala 
are charged with firstdegree murder in the case the men are being 
held without bail in the marion county jail pending their trial 
tentatively set for september 
ms jenkins said shes attempting to negotiate a plea agreement 
in rodgers case assistant state attorney jim phillips said plea 
negotiations with rodgers and elliott are under way 
the case was listed as unsolved until midjanuary when 
detectives got a tip the information resulted in the arrest of 
rodgers and elliott in febraury and smith in june 
since the men were arrested police prosecutors and defense 
attorneys have had to balance protecting their rights against the 
problems created by their handicaps 
rene johnson executive director of deaf services of west 
central florida has acted as a signlanguage interpreter for 
police and prosecutors in dealing with the men who have varying 
degrees of communication skills 
ms johnson said interpreters have to be unbiased and be able 
to walk the fence and be careful that what they sign is an 
accurate translation of what is said 
but she admits there are drawbacks 
for example american sign language doesnt have a sign for 
weapon there are signs for gun and knife but the 
language lacks a symbol for the general concept 
ms jenkins represents rodgers who can hear sounds with the use 
of hearing aids she worries that his rights have been violated and 
her effectiveness as a lawyer has been diminished because of his 
partial deafness 
after reviewing the tapes of his interrogation by police ms 
jenkins said she feels the interpreter may have summarized the 
questions asked by police and done the same with her clients 
answers 
it is very different when im conversing with a hearing 
client you can convey certain ideas with tones and inflections i 
leave an interview with him not feeling satisfied that i 
communicated with him she said 
if the case goes to trial it could be a logistical nightmare to 
make sure the defendants understand what is happening in the 
courtroom 
ms jenkins the public defender has suggested using computer 
terminals to print out questions and answers for the defendants 
its the only way i can see where he would get a fair trial 
she said

three times last week the republicans gloated 
and the democrats winced as president bush welcomed democratic 
defectors into the gop fold 
the white house doors were opened wide to showcase two of the 
coups bush personally extended a fraternal hand to retiring 
district of columbia police chief maurice turner widely 
considered a mayoral prospect for the capital and to rep tommy 
robinson of arkansas a potential gubernatorial candidate 
in the third case the president telephoned louisiana secretary 
of state fox mckeithen and congratulated him on joining the gop 
while mckeithens father the former eightyear democratic gov 
john mckeithen told his son you must be crazy 
robinson and mckeithen were the latest in a raft of southern 
officials who have deserted their traditional democratic roots for 
the party that has won five of the last six presidential elections 
the defectors stated reasons for changing parties are a desire 
to align themselves with the toughoncrime prodefense thrust of 
the republican party and the domestic agenda lumped under the 
family values category they describe the democratic party as 
liberal specialinterest oriented and not representative of their 
constituencies 
some southern switchers said they became republicans for 
political survival after witnessing the gop voting strength in 
recent elections 
turner who has not dampened speculation about a mayoral bid 
gave reasons designed to sell well with the citys overwhelming 
majority of black and democratic voters the former chief who is 
black cited bushs kindergentler effort his anticrime and 
antidrug campaign and his bid to project concern about civil 
rights and minority entrepreneurship 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater a south 
carolina native whose expertise in southern politics is widely 
acknowledged is embarked on a campaign to demonstrate to potential 
party switchers that their constituents allegiance is really to 
the gop 
while democrats control all of the souths state legislatures 
republicans now sit in five out of 11 governors chairs 
the democrats say on the one hand that the partyswitching trend 
is overblown that the republicans have attracted only two 
statewide officials and two members of congress robinson and rep 
bill grant of florida 
most of the 130 party switchers touted by the rnc are current or 
former local officials such as aldermen committee members judges 
sheriffs and school board members some two dozen state legislators 
are among the switchers 
still the democrats are not ignoring the trend especially with 
the symbolic value the republicans gain by using the white house to 
announce the switches 
robinsons congressional colleagues from arkansas democratic 
reps bill alexander and beryl anthony branded him a cagey 
politician who was snaking behind their backs for years 
democrats accused mckeithen of making deal with the gop to pay 
off his 400000 campaign debt 
turner was accused positioning himself politically against a 
hefty field of potential democratic mayoral candidates including 
incumbent mayor marion barry and perhaps jesse jackson 
the democratic national committee has a twofold approach against 
further defections threatening to defeat the officeholders who 
switch by recruiting democrats to run against them and touring the 
south to shore up their traditional support 
wed like to give powerful incentives for these people not to 
switch for example promising to beat them if they do said mike 
mccurry spokesman for the democratic national committee he said 
national democratic party staffers have fanned out to the districts 
of the deserters to seek rival candidates for forthcoming elections 
but the democrats are aware of a growing perception that the 
republican party is on a roll while people somehow feel that 
values of the democratic party are out of sync with their 
community mccurry acknowledged thats a failure on the 
democratic party to project an image of forcefulness about what 
we care about and some sense of where we would lead the country in 
the future 
it is very clear that this party has got to reach out and tell 
people what it cares about what we think america is all about 
and what america should be in the next century mccurry said 
thus while turner and robinson were shaking the presidents 
hand before a battery of cameras last week dnc chairman ron brown 
was in texas meeting with local party officials 
the dnc has calculated that brown spends about half his time 
travelling out of the capital and 40 percent of that time is in 
the south 
the democrats contend that party switching is cheating the 
voters who elected democrats the republicans said mccurry are 
making up for their inability to go out and win elections 
fair and square 
but while the republican party circulates its list of 130 
partyswitchers mccurry would point to only one on the democratic 
scorecard a former member of the south carolina legislature 
attorney john bradley who is said to be considering a 
gubernatorial bid

president wojciech jaruzelski resigned 
today as head of the communist party and was replaced by the 
outgoing prime minister a politician who has become a champion of 
hardline forces in the party 
the moves came at a twoday central committee plenum called to 
debate the future of the party which has been deeply divided by 
policy disputes and parliamentary elections in which many of its 
candidates were trounced 
the plenum also dropped five of the 18 politburo members and 
three of the nine party secretaries the official news agency pap 
announced 
jaruzelski who had led the party since 1981 promised to give 
up his post as party chief before the national assembly narrowly 
elected him to the new office of president on july 19 
but some observers were surprised that the central committee 
elected outgoing prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski by a 41 margin 
to replace jaruzelski as party leader 
the selection of the 62yearold rakowski culminated a 
remarkable political rise by an official who only joined the 
politburo in december 1987 after having been dropped from the 
government in 1985 
in recent months rakowski has been roundly criticized for his 
governments handling of the economy a party member with a long 
reputation as a reformer in the past year rakowski has become the 
champion of hardline elements in the party and those concerned 
about the rising influence of solidarity 
earlier today rakowskis government came under renewed 
criticism for its economic performance inflation has climbed into 
triple digits and basic goods such as meat bread and sugar have 
been in short supply in recent weeks 
a plan by rakowski to sharply raise food prices aug 1 has been 
criticized as not properly prepared 
the central committee accepted with one abstention the 
resignation of wojciech jaruzelski from the office of first 
secretary pap said moments later the plenum elected rakowski 
171 to 41 pap said 
the only remaining question facing the plenum which began 
friday appeared to be who will replace rakowski as prime minister 
potential candidates appeared to be politburo member wladyslaw 
baka ireneusz sekula now deputy prime minister and a rakowski 
loyalist or roman malinowski the leader of the allied united 
peasant party 
jaruzelski hinted at the plenum friday that he would not hold 
the party leadership much longer and said a full congress of the 
2millionmember party should be held soon i am standing before 
you still for the moment in a double role said jaruzelski 
referring to his election as president 
he challenged fellow communists to decide what we stand for 
pap said the plenum today adopted a resolution declaring the 
partys willingness to work with the independent solidarity trade 
union movement and with the 260 solidarity lawmakers chosen by the 
voters in june 
as a result of the countrys most democratic elections since 
world war ii the formerly banned solidarity now controls 99 out of 
100 seats in the new freely elected senate and 161 of the 460 seats 
in the sejm or parliament many partybacked candidates suffered 
humiliating defeats in the election 
the resolution reaffirmed the partys january decision to 
legalize solidarity and defined conditions needed to improve 
the economy pap said without elaborating 
earlier today the party central committee information policy 
director slawomir tabkowski told the plenum the party is changing 
too quickly for more doctrinaire members pap said 
the speaker said possibilities should be created for those who 
are disappointed with the party and those who do not identify 
with the direction of changes to leave pap said 
but jerzy majka the editor of the generally hardline party 
daily trybuna ludu said recent talk about the partys future is 
unsettling to all people not only party members according to 
pap majka said the party must maintain its rational approach 
in trying to solve polands problems 
the discussion included sharp criticism of the partys 
performance in the elections and of the governments handling of 
the economy 
in another development politburo member wladyslaw baka quit as 
party secretary in charge of the economy after delivering a speech 
criticizing rakowskis administration rakowski handed in his 
governments resignation when the new parliament was seated baka 
was considered a likely candidate to succeed rakowski as prime 
minister

senior leader deng xiaoping said in an essay 
publicized saturday that he does not approve of great democracy 
but that small democracy is needed to keep in touch with the 
masses 
allowing the masses to supervise the rulers is better than not 
having supervision wrote the 84yearold deng who has crushed 
three populist democracy movements in his decade of rule 
the last time was in june when he ordered an army attack on 
student protesters 
if we dont accept supervision and expand the democratic life 
of the party and country we will be divorced from the masses and 
commit great errors deng wrote in the essay summarized on the 
television evening news 
the report said the essay would appear in the next issue of the 
magazine party building 
deng added we do not approve of great democracy great 
democracy is avoidable and this requires having small democracy 
he did not explain what he meant by the terms but great 
democracy appeared to be a reference to the kind of unfettered 
debate that deng denounced in the recent student protests as 
leading to anarchy in past writings he also has rejected 
westernstyle parliamentary democracy as bourgeois 
by small democracy he apparently was referring to controlled 
expressions of opinion that do not challenge the power of the 
communist party he wrote that the party should be supervised by 
the masses and by the eight officially approved noncommunist 
parties that are permitted to exist 
most important the party must police itself he said 
whether or not the communist party is qualified to lead 
depends on our party itself on our partys ideology and work 
style he wrote 
the party meanwhile announced it was issuing a new book called 
deng xiaoping over 28 years written by his colleagues and 
commemorating his glorious and outstanding achievements 
publication of the essay and the book were part of a new high 
profile tinged with adulation for the aging leader who had been 
in semiretirement 
he reemerged to lead the june crackdown on the student 
protesters and since then a series of books and a movie about him 
have appeared his name appears in newspaper headlines daily and 
millions of chinese nationwide are being required to study a speech 
he made on crushing the student rebellion 
deng said in the past that he did not want the mass adulation 
revolutionary leader mao tsetung received in his last years the 
current campaign of dengist admiration falls far short of that but 
many chinese have begun drawing a parallel 
deng had been expected to retire from his last official posts 
as head of the state and party military affairs commissions later 
this year but western diplomats say they consider that unlikely 
given the armys new prominence and power 
in other developments premier li peng told a french newspaper 
publisher china is willing to maintain good relations with paris 
despite recent difficulties but that the future of relations 
depends on the french side 
the official xinhua news agency said li spoke in a meeting with 
yang yongju publisher of europe times 
france froze its relations with china to protest the crackdown 
on the protesters and china since has protested that france gave 
refuge to some fugitive student and intellectual leaders

amoco corp has signed an agreement to explore 
for oil in poland according to a published report 
under the contract signed friday in new york amoco and the 
stateowned polish oil and gas co will conduct a 12month joint 
study of geological and geophysical data on roughly 40 percent of 
the country the chicago tribune reported saturday 
if the exploration indicates potential oil reserves amoco and 
polish oil and gas would negotiate a second contract that would 
enable the chicagobased company to drill exploratory wells and 
ultimately produce oil 
amoco production co employees will go to warsaw next month and 
polish oil and gas employees will eventually come to the us 
production companys houston headquarters to study the data 
amoco the fifthbiggest usbased energy company has been 
conducting a similar study in yugoslavia 
poland produces only 3000 barrels of oil a day according to 
central intelligence agency estimates by comparison illinois 
pumps 63000 barrels a day 
poland consumes an estimated 540000 barrels of oil a day much 
of that obtained from the soviet union in exchange for machinery 
and other goods 
but the potential for oil is indicated by polands abundance of 
coal the two hydrocarbons are often found in proximity to one 
another 
poland hasnt explored intensively for oil for at least 45 
years and thus may have missed deposits detectable with todays 
sophisticated equipment said alfred munk amocos manager of 
foreign affairs 
its a problem of technical capabilities and money said jan 
szczurowski the economic attache at the polish commercial 
consulars office in new york

india staged a token withdrawal of 
600 soldiers saturday and opened negotiations with sri lanka on the 
departure of the rest of its 45000man force sent to quell ethnic 
violence 
president ranasinghe premadasa who had demanded the removal of 
the last indian soldier by the end of july sought to portray 
saturdays hastily arranged withdrawal as a victory for his 
government 
but the action seemed likely to be viewed as too little and too 
late to stop escalating assassinations and attacks on premadasas 
government by ultranationalist members of the sinhalese majority 
ethnic group 
the radicals oppose an indianbrokered peace plan to grant 
limited autonomy to minority tamils in the north and east of this 
island off indias southern coast 
indian peacekeeping forces initially numbering barely 2000 
arrived in sri lanka on july 30 1987 to supervise the surrender 
of arms by tamil guerrillas under terms of the accord but the 
largest tamil militant group reneged on the agreement 
the indian force swelled at one point to a peak of at least 
70000 men who bogged down in their own jungle war with tamil 
rebels 
both indian and sri lankan officials said they did not know when 
more indian troops would leave sri lankan and indian teams began 
three days of talks in new delhi on saturday on the issue indian 
foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth said the talks have so far 
been successful he did not elaborate 
the departing camouflageclad indian soldiers strode aboard the 
indian troop carrier magar carrying only their rifles some said 
they were told of their departure only a few hours in advance 
about 600 are leaving today gen amarjit kalkat commander 
of the indian peacekeeping force told reporters at the harbor in 
trincomalee about 145 miles northeast of colombo 
the magar whose hindi name means crocodile left trincomalee on 
saturday night sri lankas staterun radio station reported it 
was expected to reach the indian port of madras 315 miles north 
on sunday 
gen hamilton wanasinghe commander of the sri lankan army whose 
troops in trincomalee and the rest of the northeast have been 
confined to their camps since the indians arrived said this is 
a token gesture and the rest will follow 
the tamil separatist war started in 1983 with attacks on sri 
lankan troops and massacres of sinhalese civilians india the 
regions biggest military power had provided sanctuary for tamil 
fighters and got drawn into the political fray by the sympathies of 
its own tamil minority of 60 million for their sri lankan brethren 
but when the indians tried to disarm the sri lankan tamils they 
became the enemy about 1000 indian soldiers are among the 11000 
people who have died in the insurrection in the past six years 
despite the small number of troops who boarded the indian ship 
saturday the sri lankan government professed optimism that more 
soon would follow 
it is a commencement said gen sepala attygalle sri 
lankas defense secretary who flew to trincomalee to watch the 
departure 
asked whether he thought saturdays withdrawal would pacify 
sinhalese extremists attygalle said i am hopeful that there 
will be a lessening of that sort of violence 
the government accuses sinhalese extremists of 4000 killings 
mostly of sinhalese government officials and their supporters 
since the first indian troops arrived 
on friday sri lankas staterun television said premadasas 
troops shot and killed at least 74 people who violated a nationwide 
curfew to denounce the indian presence and the sri lankan 
government but foreign minister ranjan wijeratne just before 
leaving colombo for the talks in new delhi said the actual death 
toll may have been 100 to 150 he said most killed were sinhalese 
radicals 
the curfew imposed at midnight thursday was to remain in 
effect until 6 am sunday the government said it would be imposed 
again indefinitely starting at 6 pm sunday the curfew is 
designed to thwart protests and attacks by sinhalese extremists 
during the second anniversary of the 1987 peace accord 
the accord offered a measure of autonomy to tamils in the 
northeast so far a tamildominated provincial council has been 
elected but has yet to assume any real powers 
tamils mostly hindu comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people but they are the majority in the northeast 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists account for 75 percent

counterfeiting used to be a skilled 
craft but one recent case illustrates the treasury agents 
greatest fear that new photocopy technology makes it possible for 
just about anyone to produce fake money 
john p mccoy who was convicted last week in an operation that 
made 800000 worth of us and canadian currency did it with a 
hightech canon color laser copier 
it was one of the first if not the first case of the latest in 
laser copying equipment being used to counterfeit money said 
hunter howerton a secret service agent in charleston 
at one time counterfeiting was very specialized it was like 
an art howerton said printing used to be a very respected 
tradition benjamin franklin was a printer 
now all you have to be able to do is press a button 
mccoys 20 50 and 100 bills looked fine on first inspection 
but experts can easily distinguish a photocopied bill 
tiny stars on the treasury seal came out as circles and the 
backgrounds behind portraits of jackson grant and franklin were 
washed out instead of saltandpeppered said secret service agent 
art dalton the paper was different too missing the red and blue 
fibers woven into real bills 
under a microscope the difference is obvious to an expert 
letters printed with real plates are raised from the papers 
surface and sharpedged while photocopied letters are flat and 
fuzzy at the edges 
theyre good but theyre not that good said dalton who 
heads the charleston secret service office 
canon introduced its first color copier in the 1970s and 
advanced it with the use of lasers in 1987 the copiers are sold 
mostly to print shops and advertising agencies whose customers 
demand color copies of everything from photos and art work to 
documents 
mccoy got his by talking the owner of a truck parts store into 
buying him one for 35000 in return mccoy offered to split the 
profit 
manufacturers worry that their copiers could be put to illegal 
use but there is little they can do but warn customers and suggest 
that they control access to the most sophisticated machines said 
hajime hirai a spokesman for canon inc 
were doing our best but its very difficult hirai said 
mccoy 43 of slaters branch ky was convicted july 24 in us 
district court in huntington of counterfeiting and could be 
sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison and fined 500000 
the counterfeiting scheme was broken up when three accomplices 
were caught and turned mccoy in 
in a separate case mccoy was convicted in june of bank robbery 
and killing a federal witness 
the government already has talked to canon officials about 
compiling a list of color copier owners hirai said but the 
company says it cant and shouldnt 
we dont have any legal responsibilities to keep records on 
our customers and a lot of times dealers dont want to disclose 
their customers names their customers want things kept 
confidential 
there already is talk of changing the design of us currency 
canadian french and british currency are hard to reproduce 
either because of colors used or because the paper contains a 
magnetic strip 
but some people say the crooks will always find a way to get 
around changes 
you could make an invisible marking on a bill that can be seen 
by a copier but it doesnt matter hirai said the 
counterfeiters theyll just think of another way

justice of the peace agapito 
gonzalez keeps the civil docket book on a chair near the pool table 
and hears cases between posters of bikiniclad women and bags of 
potato and corn chips 
the courtroom philosophy hangs on a sign a mans got to 
believe in something i believe ill have another beer 
its cantina justice at the g amp g bar where gonzalez has been 
holding court at the familyowned business since 1966 defendants 
are free to stick around for a cold one 
they stick around they drink beer and all that said the 
75yearold jp sometimes they phone me they want to come and 
get married here and i married them here 
they want to give me a tip but it is not acceptable you 
cannot give any tip to justices it is against the law not even a 
gift 
near trophies and antlers and an old eighttrack tape deck 
cowboys drink and listen to mexican music on a juke box the aroma 
of burning mesquite and sizzling meat blows in from the back porch 
the g amp g offers free barbecue and sells its beer and chips 
gonzalez calls his son from behind the bar to bring the docket 
to his bench an aging chrome dinette set 
hes the law west of highway 281 joked county clerk arnoldo 
gonzalez leaning on the bar hes a regular at the g amp g and a 
nephew of the jp it used to be pretty bad around here knifings 
the last 10 years it has mellowed 
constable bartolo guajardo says he cant remember the last 
murder in jim wells county precinct 6 in deep south texas about 50 
miles from the gulf of mexico 
people are friendly here because we are all related agapito 
gonzalez said 
the g amp g is one of a few buildings at the center of palito 
blanco named after the native hackberry trees with bumpy whitish

barbed wire 
gonzalez deals mostly with speeding tickets poaching and 
tenantlandlord disputes a texas justice of the peace is a locally 
elected court officer a jp can perform marriages issue death 
certificates and especially in rural areas issue criminal 
warrants and conduct bond hearings 
gonzalez hears jury trials at the schoolhouse but that isnt 
very often his last jury case was two years ago the jp known for 
light fines and mercy still worries the jury was too harsh 
it was a speeding case a fellow driving 100 miles an hour 
gonzalez recalled he lose the case they charge him a little 
over 100 the jury it wasnt fair because i asked them to 
give him a break because he was a young boy he looked like being 
a very nice boy

said people here are all very poor they dont have money they 
work for their living most of them get a little less than 100 a 
week and you cant live now with 100 a week 
even rich outoftowners are likely to get off easy the jp 
says highway patrolmen he complains do not give enough warnings 
gonzalez who plans to retire next year worries about the 
retirees who get speeding tickets on us 281 on their way south 
for the winter 
i try to give them a break because they are old people like 
me and sometimes they are not driving as fast as the officer 
said gonzalez said 
and then theres the story about the lubbock banker caught 
poaching deer on a nearby ranch 
gonzalez gave him the minimum fine then he talked the game

syrian and christian gunners battled with 
howitzers and rocket launchers saturday over the ruins of a virtual 
ghost city deserted by more than a million people fleeing fighting 
that has left hundreds dead 
police said eight people were killed and 42 wounded in overnight 
and morning exchanges across the divided capital where 15 million 
people once lived 
my city is dying ill die with it i wont leave ihsan 
salam a retired civil servant said with tears in his eyes 
ill stay here if i have to die ill die in dignity in my 
apartment in my bed i dont want to live as a refugee said the 
70yearold sunni moslem who lives in west beiruts zasrif district 
the summer wind kicked up dust storms in the dirty streets and 
cats chased rats across piles of stinking garbage littering the 
oncefashionable hamra commercial thoroughfare 
banks restaurants stores and offices were closed and the once 
swarming streets were almost deserted fires blazed out of control 
and palls of thick black smoke billowed from gaping holes in 
apartment buildings 
salam is among only about 250000 people still living in beirut 
after more than four months of almost daily artillery duels 
saturdays casualties raised the overall toll to 502 killed and 
2056 wounded in the 19week confrontation between christian army 
commander gen michel aouns troops and syrian forces 
the fighting erupted after aoun imposed a naval blockade on 
illegal ports run by moslem militias south of beirut in an effort 
to recover around 100 million annually in lost customs revenues 
the syrians joined the moslem militias shelling the christian 
enclave north of beirut in retaliation and blocked its land 
entrances 
the syrians who consider lebanon within their sphere of 
influence keep about 40000 troops in predominantly moslem areas 
under a 1976 arab league mandate to end the civil war now in its 
15th year 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
rules said about half beiruts population fled to safer areas in 
the first three months of clashes 
about 350000 others deserted the capital during the past 10 
days during a devastating bombardment of residential districts he 
said 
most evacuees headed to south lebanon the eastern bekaa valley 
and summer resorts in mountains northeast of the capital 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across the wooded hills 
south of beirut early in the day as syrian army gunners pounded the 
christian suburb of baabda east of the capital 
baabda houses the presidential palace where aoun has his 
residence and headquarters 
several motorists heading to beirut to inspect their deserted 
apartments and businesses turned back to avoid being caught in 
cross fire 
theyre shelling his palace hell respond soon i dont want 
to be around when his response starts said marwan shaar a sunni 
who owns a currency trading company 
he was speaking in the syrianpoliced khaldeh area seven miles 
south of beirut the area came under fierce shelling overnight by 
christian gunners 
the police spokesman said thousands of people were spending 
nights in cars on river banks and seaside boulevards in south 
lebanon because they couldnt find accommodations or couldnt 
afford skyhigh rents 
hundreds of children played in the awali river just outside 
sidon 25 miles south of beirut their parents slept in cars or on 
mattresses and blankets on the river bank 
at least it is safe here said samir shatilla a salesman 
for an appliance company in west beirut 
shatilla said he was spending the nights with his wife and two 
sons in his old brown plymouth

in an unprecedented show of unity both 
the military government and its political foes are encouraging 
chileans to approve democratic reforms of the constitution in a 
referendum sunday 
most chileans however have shown little interest in the vote 
apparently believing the changes will pass even with a small 
turnout 
voting is mandatory but government officials and opposition 
leaders still fear many of the 76 million registered voters will 
stay home 
president augusto pinochet has sent all 16 of his cabinet 
ministers on tours of provincial cities to explain the proposed 
reforms and ask people to vote 
the head of the national electoral service juan garcia warned 
that those failing to vote will be prosecuted and may be fined 
100 thats a lot of money in a country where about a third of the 
labor force earns the legal mimimum salary of 66 a month or less 
the referendum asks chileans to approve or reject as a package 
54 changes in the 1980 constitution which was written by the 
military 
the changes include easing restrictions on marxist activity 
which has been banned 
it dilutes the governments power in the senate by increasing 
the number of seats from 36 to 48 and leaving the 
governmentappointed bloc at nine it also adds another civilian 
member to a powerful militarydominated national security council 
other changes would eliminate the presidential power to send 
chileans into exile and to dissolve the lower house of congress 
requirements for future constitutional reform would be eased 
both the government and opposition agreed to the text of the 
proposed changes 
officials said the proposals were viewed as democratizing 
the constitution although the opposition had repeatedly said they 
were insufficient 
the constitution continues to be antidemocratic but its a 
first step which will allow us all to build together a really 
democratic institutional system said ricardo lagos a prominent 
socialist leader 
constitutional experts and political leaders had said public 
apathy during the campaign stemmed from the widespread belief the 
proposed changes would be approved even with a small turnout 
theres nothing dramatic about this referendum said edgardo 
boeninger vice president of the centrist christian democratic 
party the largest in the opposition 
there is no one to beat this time he told the associated 
press 
he also said chileans had displayed little interest because they 
were ill informed and considered the changes very complex 
nearly all the major political parties and the government urged 
approval of the changes in 40second television spots broadcast by 
all the countrys stations the spots were allocated at no charge 
to opposition parties 
about the only controversy of the campaign broke out when the 
government censored at least 10 opposition television spots 
claiming they were illegal it said they were intended as party 
propaganda not to clarify the referendum 
the countrys last referendum was oct 5 and turnout was 97 
percent at issue was whether pinochets rule should be extended 
until 1997 the extension was overwhelmingly rejected

cambodias agony began nearly 20 years ago when 
proamerican generals ousted a neutralist prince since then 
millions have been killed made homeless or fled the killing field 
that their homeland has become 
the 1970 coup against cambodian leader prince norodom sihanouk 
set off a cycle of national devastation that an international 
conference in paris is now trying to reverse 
under gen lon nol the usbacked coup leaders took on the 
communists of neighboring vietnam and their cambodian allies the 
khmer rouge in a fiveyear war 
some people called it a sideshow to the vietnam war 
but it killed an estimated 1 million people as ground troops 
engaged in fierce combat and washington launched one of the most 
intense aerial bombardments in history 
on april 17 1975 the blackclad khmer rouge marched into the 
cambodian capital and began to herd its 2 million people into the 
countryside at gunpoint 
khmer rouges year zero had begun society was to be totally 
cleansed and all resisters eliminated in the southeast asian nation 
the most conservative estimates say hundreds of thousands were 
executed or died of diseases and hunger in khmer rouge labor camps 
the current cambodian government claims 33 million died as leader 
pol pot turned on class enemies who included children the 
handicapped and anyone who spoke a foreign language 
vietnams 1978 invasion rid the country of the khmer rouge but 
spawned another conflict 
from jungle bases along the thaicambodian border a threeparty 
coalition led by sihanouk mounted a guerrilla campaign against the 
vietnamese and the new cambodian government they had installed the 
khmer rouge formed part of the coalition 
more than a quartermillion civilians remain in sprawling 
vulnerable camps along the embattled frontier fighting in the 
interior and uncertainty about the future hampers development in 
cambodia one of the worlds poorest countries 
with vietnam promising to pull out its remaining forces in 
cambodia by the end of september threats of more bloodshed looms 
the powerful khmer rouge could attempt a comeback and carry out

the nations governors opened their annual 
conference saturday with a call for more investment in 
transportation and a complaint that the federal government is 
hoarding money that should be spent on highways and airports 
unfortunately when it comes to transportation america is 
often stuck in neutral said virginias democratic gov gerald 
baliles chairman of the national governors association 
president bush planned to arrive monday to address the governors 
the governors association sought to steer clear of partisanship 
during its meeting which concludes tuesday and planned to focus 
on efforts to improve us performance in the international economy 
the bipartisan association released a report saying improvements 
in transportation are essential for the nation to become more 
competitive with foreign industry it warned that transportation 
facilities are deteriorating at a faster rate than they are being 
repaired or replaced 
the report called for more regional and federal planning 
increased use of tolls developer fees and other user fees and 
release of uncommitted balances in federal trust funds for 
highways aviation mass transit and waterways 
at an opening news conference baliles and illinois republican 
gov james thompson charged that the bush administration and the 
reagan administration before it have withheld billions of dollars 
from the states in highway and airport trust funds they said the 
amounts sent to the state were restricted in order to count the 
reserves in the federal budget and make the federal debt appear 
smaller 
our view is that money represents tax dollars already paid by 
the people of this country and they ought to be spent for the 
purpose for which they were collected and not used to play games 
with the size of the budget deficit in washington baliles said 
baliles said as much as 19 billion was held in the two trust 
funds from money collected through the federal taxes on gasoline 
and airplane fares charilyn w cowan director of capital 
resources for the governors association staff estimated as much 
as 13 billion of that amount has accumulated as an uncommitted 
cash surplus or is behing withheld from the states for various 
technical reasons 
transportation secretary samuel skinner will address the 
governors monday and thompson said he intended to ask skinner 
about the trust funds skinner and other transportation department 
officials have told the governors in the past that much of the 
money is already obligated for future spending on transportation 
projects 
snarled traffic and shipping delays caused by deteriorating 
transportation systems the report said add to the cost of doing 
business for american companies 
the vitality of both transportation and commerce is now 
threatened by a pattern of underinvestment and neglect said 
baliles today rather than being the pride of america our 
transportation systems are becoming one of its limiting factors 
restraining economic growth 
the report was written by a task force of governors headed by 
thompson the conference host who recently announced he would not 
seek a fifth term 
thompsons task force cited estimates that 1 trillion to 3 
trillion in spending will be required over the next 20 years to 
bring the nations transportation infrastructure into reasonable 
condition that would require annual outlays of 50 billion to 
150 billion 
the report cited state efforts to fill the gap left by 
reductions in federal spending on transportation but it said 
states have been constrained by federal tax laws restricting use of 
taxexempt bonds for public works 
we need to find the political will for america to make the 
investment in our transportation infrastructure an investment that 
will help keep the american marketplace at the center of the 
worlds commerce said thompson 
democrats hold a 28 to 22 majority over republicans among the 50 
state governors after picking up one seat in the 1988 election 
the full group planned to consider a resolution already 
approved by its executive committee urging action to reduce the 
federal deficit while protecting safety net social programs and 
avoiding a tax increase if possible it advocates a selective 
freeze on defense and domestic spending 
the abortion issue was not on the governors agenda but was 
expected to be discussed privately the meeting is the first 
bipartisan gathering of governors since the supreme courts recent 
decision permitting states greater leeway in regulating abortions 
at least one group the national abortion rights action league 
which supports a womans right to have an abortion said it had 
obtained a police permit for a small demonstration sunday 
by prior agreement iowas republican gov terry branstad is to 
become chairman of the governors association at the end of the 
meeting succeeding baliles who who leaves office as governor at 
the end of this year

police disguised as relatives of a kidnapped 
businessman killed two bandits in a highway shootout saturday after 
tricking the kidnappers into thinking they were on the trail of 
37 million in ransom 
following the shooting police combed the coutryside outside 
rome in search of the victim dante belardinelli whose jolly caffe 
business distributes coffee and other food products 
the shootout which also left two bandits and four policemen 
wounded occurred a day before a deadline set by belardinellis 
kidnappers

million they said if the money was not paid july 30 belardinelli 
65 would be killed

drive up and down the highway from arezzo in central italy to 
reggio calabria in the south a distance of about 600 miles with 
the ransom until the bandits caught up with her and gave her a 
signal 
the daughter was told to drive a fiat 126 with a chair mounted 
on a roof luggage rack 
italian television and new agency reports said a florence 
investigating magistrate decided it was too dangerous for 
belardinellis daughter to drive the car 
swat team police chosen for their resemblance to the daughter 
and two other relatives instead got in the fiat and began driving 
authorities said 
when the fiat was on the highway outside rome a bigger car with 
four people inside pulled up to it when the bandits realized they 
had been tricked they opened fire with a pistol and sawedoff 
shotguns and the police fired back the ansa news agency reported 
two of the four bandits were killed and the other two were 
wounded and captured one of the police officers was in a coma 
ansa said 
a second car also believed to hold bandits sped away the 
reports said 
ansa said the four bandits had been linked to previous 
kidnappings it quoted the florence magistrate pierluigi vigna as 
saying the police did not have any ransom money with them

in a major policy change regarding 
religion the hungarian communist party announced saturday that it 
will no longer require members to be atheists and that it will stop 
meddling in church affairs 
the changes were approved friday by the central committee and 
announced saturday in a communique carried by the official mti news 
agency 
the hungarian socialist workers party is not an atheist party 
but a party committed to the cause of social progress central 
committee member janos berecz said friday after the committee met 
in budapest 
berecz who presented the meeting with a report he helped 
prepare on religion told reporters the party will now be open to 
people with religious convictions and that it will ensure 
separation of church and state 
recently the party abolished the office for church affairs 
which supervised and often interfered with organized religion 
speaking at a news conference berecz emphasized the need of 
abandoning the inflexible rules and guaranteeing freedom of 
conscience within the party mti reported he said the partys 
bylaws will be modified to reflect the changes in policy the 
central committee has approved 
there are no official statistics on church membership in 
hungary but 70 percent of hungarian christians are believed to be 
roman catholics although a large number of them do not regularly 
attend church 
in the past some party members were known to have been 
catholics but they rarely dared to profess their beliefs in public 
making the free exercise of religion complete the dialogue 
between marxists and the faithful should continue on the highest 
level berecz said 
pope john paul ii plans to visit hungary for the first time in 
1991 and diplomatic relations with the vatican may be 
reestablished soon 
the dramatic police changes may be an attempt by the party to 
polish up its image prior to next years first multiparty elections 
in hungary since 1948 
party leaders decided friday to hold the partys congress oct 
6 a day earlier than originally scheduled the goal of the meeting 
is to unite divided party members and chart winning policies for 
the 1990 elections

coleman youngs campaign for a fifth mayoral term 
was considered a breeze until us rep john conyers unexpectedly 
entered the race last week 
the 13term congressman lacks the local political organization 
and estimated 5 million in campaign funds that young has but 
conyers is wellknown and liked in detroit early polls show him 
running tight with young and the two dominating the sept 12 
nonpartisan primary in which 13 candidates will be winnowed to two 
it could very well be a close race young said late last 
week i dont expect any race to be easy 
that was a sharp contrast to youngs earlier statement about 
conyers now that hes in i will shoot at him like hes a 
rabbit 
wilbur rich a political science professor at wayne state 
university and author of a biography on young played down the 
significance of the polls 
if conyers survives the primary then i think there will be 
a very tight and very bitter race i think conyers probably thinks 
coleman has something about his personality people dont like and 
will try to build on that 
young 71 defeated detroit accountant tom barrow with 61 
percent of the vote in 1985 before conyers 60 entered the race 
barrow was the favorite to meet young in november 
coleman has got one good campaign left in him rich said 
i think he will be more colorful more flamboyant in his campaign 
rhetoric i think he wants to show people he still wants to do the 
job 
barrow said he still thinks he will win the right to face young 
again 
young who hasnt faced a real challenge since his first bid for 
mayor in 1973 has been under attack this year critics accuse him 
of failing to reverse the citys chronic crime and unemployment 
problems 
on a more personal level young agreed earlier this year to pay 
child support following a highly publicized paternity suit in which 
blood tests confirmed he fathered the 6yearold son of a former 
city employee 
even with a perception of youngs vulnerability conyers entry 
into the race baffled some observers who question why he would give 
up his seniority in congress where he is chairman of the 
government operations committee the house watchdog panel 
i am very puzzled rich said hes been around a long time 
and could really do a lot of good for detroit in that position 
in congress 
rich believes conyers may be laying the groundwork for 1993 
when young is expected to step down 
i think this is going to be a showcase for 93 the 
postyoung era he said 
how long conyers popularity will hold out is another question 
i think john has always been a man of symbols always engaged 
in symbolic events rich said referring to conyers opposition 
to the vietnam war his involvement in former president richard 
nixons impeachment and his support of a holiday honoring the rev 
martin luther king jr 
whatever his flaws are theyll come out barrow said 
city council president erma henderson also could be a factor in 
the primary by siphoning support from conyers her longtime friend 
with whom she appeared arminarm the day he filed his nominating 
petitions henderson said friday she is in the race to stay 
most observers think henderson and barrow are preparing for 
1993 when pop singer stevie wonder an early motown recording 
star has said he wants to run for mayor 
two polls taken last week showed the extent of support for young 
and conyers a detroit free presswxyztv poll showed young with 31 
percent and conyers with 27 percent of voter support in the

thomas root who survived after his plane 
wandered 800 miles along the east coast and crashed into the 
atlantic said saturday he did not set out to kill himself but 
briefly considered suicide waiting for rescue 
it was at that moment that and only that moment that i 
ever stared the notion of suicide right in the face root said 
it sent it was almost a jolt of electricity right through me 
the very thought running through my mind i started swimming 
swimming erratically and hard and wasted energy in the process 
before i calmed myself down 
root made his comments in an interview broadcast saturday by 
radio station wswr root is an owner of the station in this 
northcentral ohio community 
wswr reporter jim norris said he interviewed root thursday at 
the home of roots parents in plymouth ohio where he has been 
recovering from his injuries which included an unexplained gunshot 
wound root reached there saturday morning by the associated 
press declined to comment further 
norris said root left plymouth later saturday headed for 
washington dc 
root 36 an alexandria va communications lawyer was en 
route from washingtons national airport to rocky mount nc july 
13 when he told air traffic controllers he was having trouble 
breathing he put his plane on autopilot and military planes kept 
watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel and ditched near the 
bahamas 
root said he was unconscious until the plane hit the water and 
did not know how he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen which 
doctors noticed after his rescue he checked out of a hollywood 
fla hospital monday 
root said pain and exhaustion almost overcame him while he 
fought to stay afloat until rescuers could arrive 
i hurt an awful lot while i was swimming and i dont know why 
i knew i had a knot in my stomach i knew it was very difficult to 
use my left arm he said 
he said reports since the crash including allegations of 
financial troubles and attacks on his credibility have shaken his 
faith in the media 
in the week following my crash i became some kind of a drug 
dealer and a gun smuggler my law practice was taken apart root 
said it seemed as though the media were beating the bushes for 
anybody in washington who wanted to take a potshot at me 
root was sued thursday by a group of investors in new orleans 
who allege he cost them 125000 in 1987 when he represented them 
in a bid to obtain a federal communications commission license the 
lawsuit accuses root of legal malpractice 
military pilots who followed roots cessna 210 over the atlantic 
reported seeing the pilot slumped at the controls but said his 
head and the planes sun visor moved several times 
although blood tests for carbon monoxide were negative root 
said he believes a carbon dioxide buildup may have caused him to 
black out during the flight he said a former navy diver had 
described incidents in which carbon dioxide would build up in the 
lungs leading to headaches and hard breathing and lapses of 
consciousness 
you know somethings wrong but you dont know what he 
said and when you do lapse into unconsciousness its a very 
troubled unconsciousness and youre contstantly trying to pull 
yourself out it sounded to me an awful lot like what i went 
through 
root said he was unaware he had been shot until doctors told him 
at the hospital he has acknowledged keeping a loaded revolver in 
the planes glove compartment root and his relatives speculated 
the 32caliber smith amp wesson may have gone off on impact a 
theory the manufacturer discounted 
when i asked questions about it at hollywood memorial 
hospital the doctor suggested to me that if it had happened before 
impact significantly before impact he doubted that i would have 
had the strength to swim around for 15 minutes in the ocean till i 
got pulled out root said 
root said he has hired a washington lawyer primarily to quell 
the hysteria generated by the crash

scientists say 106000 people should be evacuated 
from their villages in byelorussia due to contamination from the 
chernobyl nuclear accident not 11000 as the government 
recommends tass said saturday 
scientists and legislators speaking before the byelorussian 
republics legislature also said a broader program is needed to 
provide a normal life for people of the region the official news 
agency reported 
the cost of such a large resettlement would reach 156 billion 
well beyond the finanical capabilities of the republic just north 
of the power plant which is in the ukraine 
the estimate exceeds the 125 billion official figure for the 
cumulative cost of the chernobyl cleanup 
an explosion at the plant the worst nuclear accident ever 
scattered radiation across hundreds of miles the accident killed 
31 people according to official accounts 
chernobyl is a disaster of the whole country so the whole 
country must participate in curing the wounds tass said in 
describing the arguments presented at the legislative session it 
did not say when the meeting was held 
the deputies who were not identified argued that over eight to 
10 years complete resettlement would be less expensive than trying 
to improve living conditions in the contaminated area 
a byelorussian parliamentary commission will consider the 
question tass said 
more than 130000 people have been evacuated from homes in the 
immediate vicinity of chernobyl

nearly 20 nations including the united states and 
soviet union begin an international conference sunday aimed at 
ending a conflict in cambodia that the warring factions appear 
unable to resolve 
after three days of meetings in preparation for the conference 
the four cambodian factions agreed only on seating arrangements for 
their representatives and on the quality of a catered lunch 
left for the international conference to tackle are the 
monitoring of vietnams military pullout from cambodia the shape 
of an interim cambodian government and the future role of the 
khmer rouge ousted from power after the vietnamese invasion in 
1978 
on the eve of the meeting secretary of state james a baker iii 
ruled out participation of khmer rouge leaders in any future 
government 
baker met for 3 hours saturday with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze one of dozens of preconference meetings 
scheduled between visiting officials 
a soviet spokesman vitaly churkin said there was a large 
area of common ground on cambodia and that both sides did not 
want to see the khmer rouge return to power 
a senior state department official said both countries stressed 
the importance of a comprehensive solution but still had 
differences on how it should work 
as the delegates confer the clock will be running in indochina 
vietnam has reiterated that no matter what happens in paris it 
will withdraw its remaining forces by the end of september 
this would leave the prohanoi government in cambodia facing 
alone the khmer rouge and two noncommunist allies on the 
battlefields 
those optimistic about peace point to two years of lower level 
talks and note a softening of positions by the soviet union which 
backs vietnam and cambodia and by china the chief arms supplier 
to the cambodian guerrillas 
pessimists say outside powers pressing to end the war may 
merely paper over differences and that the killing will continue 
after prolonged wrangling the four cambodian factions agreed 
last week that cambodia will be listed as a single entity at the 
conference but with four subdelegations seated at the table sharp 
disagreement persisted on virtually every other issue 
its like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot 
continue its journey said prime minister hun sen of cambodia one 
day last week 
the previous day resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk said 
he and hun sen had agreed on nothing except the excellence of the 
catered cambodian lunch 
hun sen rejects the idea of khmer rouge participation in any 
interim government saying it would try to grab power and launch 
another reign of terror the communist ultras killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians in a radical revolution before being ousted 
sihanouk is in uneasy alliance with the khmer rouge guerrillas 
describing them as monsters but maintaining that excluding them 
from an interim government would increase chances for more fighting 
a us policy paper for the conference said washington would 
continue to support sihanouk as the transition leader if he 
believed khmer rouge elements not leaders should have an 
interim role 
sihanouk and his allies favor a strong united nations presence 
to monitor the vietnamese withdrawal the disarming of the warring 
sides and the supervision of general elections hun sen and vietnam 
oppose major un participation unless the cambodian seat in the 
united nations now held by sihanouks coalition is vacated 
hun sen and his vietnamese backers separate the internal and 
international aspects of the cambodian problem and say each can be 
dealt with separately sihanouk and his supporters including 
noncommunist southeast asia and the united states want a 
comprehensive solution 
i dont see prospects for an accord between sihanouk and hun 
sen in paris said southeast asia expert michael leifer of 
britain recently ive come to the dismal conclusion that some 
kind of civil war is inevitable 
a number of other western cambodia scholars who met recently in 
thailand concurred noting the increasingly confident cambodian 
government has yet to test its military mettle against the 
guerrillas 
and the khmer rouge particularly these analysts say is 
unlikely to concede anything at the negotiating table without first 
seeing how much it can gain on a battlefield vacated by vietnams 
troop 
there are signs of give and take 
vietnam and china the key regional protagonists have improved 
relations in recent months thailand through which arms flow to 
the guerrillas has been a host to hun sen in bangkok 
the soviet union eager to cut the drain of bankrolling 
vietnams war machine is reliably said to have put pressure on its 
ally to compromise in apparent opposition to vietnam and cambodia 
moscow has called for substantial un involvement 
current plans call for ministerial level talks to last until 
tuesday to be followed by meetings of several committees to focus 
on specific issues over several weeks before a final highlevel 
session is convened 
there will be 20 delegations one will represent the un 
secretarygeneral zimbabwe will attend as a representative of the 
nonaligned movement 
cambodia and 17 other nations account for the remaining 
delegations in addition to the united states and soviet union 
other nations attending are china japan vietnam britain india 
thailand australia brunei canada laos malaysia the 
philippines singapore and cohosts france and indonesia

a metropolis of tents will be 
virginias 18th largest city for eight days when 30000 boy scouts 
set up camp for their national jamboree 
the gathering which will include a hightech video show as well 
as more traditional scouting activities like archery and 
flagraising begins wednesday 
the logistics of running an operation of this size its 
quite an achievement in its own right said ron garland director 
of public relations for the jamboree 
fort ap hill outside fredericksburg has been the site for 
the last two jamborees and has been designated the permanent site 
for the gatherings that take place every four years 
a 7000acre area at the army fort will hold the tent city 
which will have a population of 34000 counting scouts staff and 
volunteers 
workers have been busy for a year installing services including 
a new water and sewer system a bank a 160bed hospital three 
post offices and even a daily newspaper called the jamboree today 
food being trucked in includes 10 tons of butter 20000 heads 
of lettuce 380000 pints of milk 90000 hotdogs 70000 
hamburgers and a million cans of soft drinks 
for the army the jamboree provides a potential logistical 
nightmare similar to a largescale movement of troops 
the army is getting a chance to do the things theyre trained 
to do but they need a conflict to do it said jamboree director 
ralph jordan but this isnt a conflict its a happy 
association 
for instance getting participants together for two shows will 
require that the scouts be led out of their 20 subcamps at 
staggered times so they dont all arrive at once 
its also a good imagebuilder for the army jordan said 
the kids will see the army with a very positive attitude 
the jamboree will kick off with an opening show arranged by 
movie director steven spielberg and using two 30by40foot video 
screens spielberg movie characters including r2d2 and et will 
be on hand and the show will conclude with a 15minute laser and 
fireworks display 
for more traditional activities there are three action 
centers an aquatics area a conservation area and a fishing 
lake stocked with about 20000 fish 
scouts can try archery air rifle target practice bicycle 
motorcross a physical fitness course volleyball flag raising 
and a slippery tugofwar complete with soapy water 
the national aeronautics and space administration will have an 
exhibit including a model of the space shuttle 
the boy scouts of america have held a national jamboree almost 
every four years since the first one in washington dc in 1937 
the world organization of the scout movement holds a world jamboree 
every four years the last one was held in australia in 198889

the selection of mieczyslaw f rakowski to 
lead polands communist party through an era of political upheaval 
culminates the remarkable comeback of a man ousted from government 
in 1985 
rakowski chosen saturday by a divided communist party only 
joined the partys ruling politburo on dec 15 1987 
although he supports a radical restructuring of the economy he 
acknowledges he is now linked more with the partys conservative 
elements than its reformist wing 
under rakowskis leadership as premier the government ended 
gasoline rationing and legalized the black market in foreign 
currencies 
but in his nine months as prime minister the economy has 
deteriorated and rakowski made little progress in winning the 
hearts of solidarity supporters who remember him as one of the 
unions scrappiest foes 
with inflation now in triple digits and many basic commodities 
such as meat bread and sugar in short supply rakowskis promotion 
to the head party post in a 17141 vote might seem peculiar 
he became deputy prime minister feb 12 1981 but his 
abrasiveness made him enemies he lost that post in november 1985 
when several hardliners were dumped from the government 
from 1985 to 1987 he held a largely ceremonial position as 
deputy speaker of the sejm or parliament 
he was one of 33 senior officials who ran unopposed for 
parliament in june but failed to capture even half the votes one 
party member in the debate saturday said only 35 percent of polish 
people voice confidence in the government now compared with 72 
percent shortly after rakowski took office 
but rakowskis calls for the party to stand firm in the face of 
its difficulties apparently have appealed to party conservatives 
and those in the central committee who feel threatened by the rise 
of solidaritys influence the union won 260 of 261 parliament 
seats it contested in june 
rakowski succeeds wojciech jaruzelski who resigned saturday as 
he had promised to do before being elected president 
a man of peasant origins who rose to become one of polands 
leading journalists from 1958 through 1982 rakowksi was editor of 
polityka a communistcontrolled but generally liberal weekly that 
was considered even daring through the 1970s 
the 62yearold rakowski was named prime minister sept 27 and 
formed his government oct 14 he was rebuffed by opposition 
members he sought to enlist 
although rakowski in january urged legalization of solidarity 
after its sevenyear ban he did not take an active role in the 
talks that followed solidarity was legalized again in april 
rakowski became unpopular with leaders of solidarity during its 
16month legal period in 198081 one of his first acts as prime 
minister was to announce the closing of the lenin shipyard in 
gdansk solidaritys birthplace in a move many union members 
interpreted as a personal vendetta 
during solidaritys early months as a legal group rakowski 
headed the governments committee for trade unions and served as 
the governments chief negotiator with solidarity 
he also played a major role in defending the suppression of the 
union after the introduction of martial law dec 13 1981 
born in the village of kowalewek in northwest poland on dec 1 
1926 rakowski was a teenage laborer during the nazi occupation of 
poland and served in the polish army from the time of the 
liberation until 1949 
he joined the communist party in 1946 and attended the institute 
of social sciences in moscow 
in a widely circulated memorandum on polands political 
situation written before his politburo appointment rakowski backed 
further democratization and economic reform 
but he also urged the party to stake out more clearly its 
ideological differences with solidarity 
in a newspaper interview last week rakowski said the party 
should resist attempts to divide it 
he called on the party to become a pragmatic leftist party of 
the 21st century but he added to be pragmatic does not mean 
to disrespect marxism and the historical achievements of polish 
socialists and communists

the united states and the soviet union began 
plotting a superpower summit saturday and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze said president bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
will meet rather soon if all goes well 
the smiling soviet official gave this optimistic assessment and 
a generally rosy view of superpower relations except for 
disagreement on afghanistan after a threehour and 10minute 
meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii at the soviet 
embassy here 
baker said he would meet shevardnadze again sept 1920 
probably in wyoming to make further summit preparations

international conference on cambodias future that will open on 
sunday with the aim of arranging a cease fire to end a 10year 
civil war and put the southeast asia country on the path to 
rehabilitation 
a soviet foreign minister official vitaly churkin said 
shevardnadze had registered his governments disappointment 
with continuing us weapons shipments to rebels in afghanistan who 
are trying to unseat the promoscow government of president 
najibullah 
but both shevardnadze and churkin stressed the positive aspects 
of the meeting which ran an hour and 10 minutes longer than 
scheduled 
they said shevardnadze had given baker a letter from soviet 
president gorbachev to bush as well as a series of memoranda to 
further economic and cultural cooperation and a report on human 
right s developments in the soviet union 
dominating the meeting was gorbachevs program to restructure 
the soviet economy in his report on perestroika shevardnadze 
expressed sympathy for striking miners and said they were not 
challenging the soviet leaders reform program a senior us 
official told reporters at a briefing 
baker offered technical advice to the soviets on how to switch 
from a marxist to a marketoriented economy and reaffirmed us 
hopes gorbachev would succeed said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
at a joint news conference in a sunny courtyard shevardnadze 
said of prospects for bushs first summit with gorbachev if we 
prepare well and successfully then a summit will take place rather 
soon 
us officials said the bakershevardnadze in september probably 
will be at jackson hole wyo a resort favored by judges and 
wealthy businessmen as well as skiers was the likely site 
baker in response to a question said bush and gorbachev 
obviously will get together at some point but he declined to 
say whether the summit would be scheduled for this year 
he said he had covered a wide range of subjects with 
shevardnadze including the cambodian conference arms control 
afghanistan central america and the middle east 
shevardnadze called the session constructive and businesslike 
while churkin told reporters it was a very relaxed kind of 
conversation a shirtsleeved conversation 
baker and shevardnadze said they decided to appoint a joint 
ussoviet delegation to hold periodic meetings on prospects for 
an arabisraeli settlement 
dennis ross a close aide to baker who heads the policy planning 
office of the state department will head the us delegation while 
gennadi terrasov of the soviet foreign ministry will lead his group 
however on afghanistan churkin said shevardnadze expressed 
some dissatisfaction with the role the united states is playing 
there 
referring to continued us arms shipments to the mujahedeen 
through pakistan the soviet official said we feel what has 
happened is part of an attempt at a military solution to the 
countrys continuing conflict between the rebels and government 
forces 
on friday in washington an american official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the soviets not only had left huge 
stockpiles of weapons behind when the red army completed its 
withdrawal on kabul in midfebruary but were providing tanks scud 
missiles and other arms at a rate of up to 3 billion a year or 
about double what moscow gave the government during its nineyear 
military occupation 
churkin said ussoviet efforts toward a 40nation treaty to 
ban chemical weapons had picked up speed and that the us and 
soviet delegations might be upgraded in order to push for agreement 
soon 
he said there was no discussion of a us investigation of a 
suspended state department official felix s bloch who is 
suspected of spying for the soviet union

helped organize the weekend celebration 
rain has fallen 96 out of the past 112 july 29ths in waynesburg 
a community of about 5000 about 35 miles south of pittsburgh 
there have been 19 rainless rain days since the town began keeping 
records in 1876 ms longstreth said 
the national weather service forecast called for sunny skies 
saturday with a high near 80 degrees 
not a drop had fallen by late saturday afternoon but ms 
longstreth said it wouldnt take much more than a drizzle to 
satisfy the community on rain day 
just a few drops in the borough limits is enough she said 
the pleasant weather didnt stop residents many of whom carried 
umbrellas from enjoying the festivities events included a rain 
dance games an umbrella contest music a crafts sale and the 
making of a banana split served in a 113foot gutter 
residents say the legend began more than a century ago when a 
farmer told the towns pharmacist william anderson that his 
records showed it almost always rained on july 29 
as the pattern emerged over the years some residents began 
marking each rain day with weather bets

the days of orthodox jews having to take their 
own food out to the ballgame are gone thanks to a new food stand at 
memorial stadium that sells kosher hot dogs 
im going to buy a kosher hot dog and believe me it will be 
a thrill because ive never had a hot dog at an orioles game 
eleanor ashman of cheswolde said as she lined up at the premier 
at the ballpark stand operated by premier caterers ltd of 
pikesville the stand at memorial stadium is believed to be the 
first of its kind at any of the 26 major league baseball parks 
this is a great boon said sandy willner of randallstown 
my family has box seats at the stadium and weve always had to 
bring our own food with us but this is wonderful it makes me feel 
like im part of the crowd 
orthodox jews require food to be ritually fit in accordance with 
jewish law 
frank storch is credited with the idea for the stand storch 
who owns some property the orioles use for a ticket and souvenir 
store used his connection with the team to propose the kosher 
concept 
whenever id take orthodox clients to a ball game we couldnt 
get kosher food said storch so i had this idea 
people seem excited about it he said i can see it 
leading to many more stands just like it at ballparks all over the 
country 
i used to bring my own food to the games mostly peanut butter 
and jelly sandwiches not anymore i think this will bring more 
jewish people out to the games definitely said zev henesch of 
greenspring 
even nonjews were lining up herb smith of annapolis said i 
happen to like kosher hot dogs they seem healthier they seem to 
be better for you

the first organized opposition in the soviet 
parliament in nearly 70 years was formed saturday by 368 
legislators who gathered to plan their strategy for greater 
political and economic reforms 
even the official news agency tass said the historic event could 
be described as the birth of the soviet opposition 
tass called the organization leftradical 
in another development latvia joined the two other baltic 
republics lithuania and estonia in declaring itself sovereign 
with the right to veto soviet laws on its territory tass reported 
among the members of the opposition group are human rights 
activist andrei sakharov maverick communist boris yeltsin vitaly 
korotich editor of the reform magazine ogonyoky and economist 
gavriil popov it will operate under the title interregional 
deputies group 
elena kotova who participated in the meeting but is not a 
legislator said our desired aim is to have the equivalent of a 
western party 
the left socialist revolutionaries was the last opposition party 
to survive the bolshevik purges following the 1917 revolution it 
was suppressed in 1922 
president mikhail s gorbachev has ordered many reforms since 
coming to power in 1985 but has strongly opposed allowing an 
alternative party to the communists 
leaders of the new organization said enough contributions have 
been received to begin publishing a newspaper 
mikhail bocharov a deputy from suburban moscow said the 
newspaper the peoples deputy will start with a circulation of 
300000 and sell for about 80 cents a copy 
that is more than 18 times the cost of the communist party 
newspaper pravda but considerably less than a soviet fashion 
magazine 
historian yuri afanasiev a deputy from moscow said the group 
will meet sunday and hopes to reach agreement on a platform 
tass predicted yeltsin would be elected leader but afanasiev 
indicated the group is leaning toward a governing council with 
several deputies 
the organization is still a small minority in the 2250seat 
congress of peoples deputies the soviet parliament nikolai 
medvedev a deputy from lithuania said most of his colleagues from 
the three baltic republics had left moscow for the weekend but when 
they returned they could add up to 140 members to the group 
it was not clear how many of the opposition deputies are also 
members of the smaller legislative branch of the congress called 
the supreme soviet 
the group could have its most immediate effect on the political 
process by proposing laws the supreme soviet gained that power 
this spring but so far it has considered only proposals put forth 
by the kremlin leadership 
moscow deputy sergei stankevich writing in the first issue of 
the peoples deputy said that fears instilled by years of 
political tyranny made people shy away from an open opposition 
popov opened saturdays meeting in the crowded auditorium of the 
soviet filmmakers union with a call to bring reform through legal 
changes instead of what he called the governments spontaneous 
approach to crises 
tass said the group has a place in the reform process but 
reported some legislators have expressed the fear that in this 
complex time for the country when unity of action is required 
this leftradical group might turn into some kind of opposition 
organizers of the group said it has been tolerated by the 
government bureaucracy and was not allowed to meet in the kremlin 
among issues discussed saturday were proposals that would give 
enterprises more independence and allow soviets living abroad who 
were stripped of their citizenship to reclaim it 
tass said the latvian parliaments declaration of sovereignty 
means that laws of the ussr will go into effect on the 
territory of latvia only after their ratification by the highest 
organ of government in the republic 
when estonia declared its sovereignty last november the kremlin 
called the action unconstitutional 
on thursday however the supreme soviet gave preliminary 
approval to resolutions that would give latvia estonia and 
lithuania economic independence by jan 1 
estonia has tried to assert independence on issues of public 
concern such as environmental protection lithuania followed 
estonias example this summer after its sajudis reform group won a 
majority of the republics seats in the soviet unions first 
contested elections for parliament

prime minister mario machungo outlined 
the ruling partys new political and economic policies saturday and 
said an independent economy is necessary to build socialism 
the outline indicated that the party the front for the 
liberation of mozambique or frelimo is moving away from marxism 
and central planning 
frelimo has governed mozambique under a oneparty 
marxistleninist policy since gaining power after the country 
gained independence from portugal in 1975 
but its policy document presented last week to frelimos first 
national congress since 1983 dropped all references to marxism 
the document described the party as socialist it also said 
frelimo is open to all mozambicans and is not just a workerpeasant 
alliance 
the party congress has already been presented with its central 
committees recommendations to open ranks to businessmen property 
owners shopkeepers and religious believers 
the congress convened july 24 and is to close monday 
during saturdays session machungo said the process of 
building socialism requires the creation of an independent and 
advanced economy 
he said the effort also would require the active participation 
of various property regimes stateowned cooperative and peasant 
family property and private or jointventure forms of property 
several years ago the government began opening the economy 
encouraging private enterprise and foreign investments mainly to 
meet requirements for loans from the international monetary fund 
and world bank 
about half of mozambiques 14 million people are wholly or 
partly dependent on donated food and 16 million are refugees from 
the 12yearold civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead 
machungo said the major change from the social and economic 
directives of 1983 is that today frelimo does not attempt to 
establish target figures for every sector of the economy instead 
the directives set out basic policy goals 
he said the new directives lay heavy stress on peasant family 
agriculture rather than on state farms but that state farms 
still have an important role in producing exports 
machungo said the directives also call for increased labor 
productivity and for the implementation of the principle of paying 
more to those who work more carry out their duties better and 
attain the best indexes of efficiency 
the central committee said it would allow private schools 
outlawed in 1975 to be reestablished because the government was 
unable to provide education for all of the countrys children it 
said rebels have destroyed or forced the closure of 2699 primary 
schools in rural areas

the christian church disciples of christ 
saturday endorsed a working partnership with the united church of 
christ despite criticism from some members that the united church 
is too liberal 
delegates to the christian church disciples of christ general 
assembly approved a resolution for full communion between the two 
churches including mutual recognition of members and clergy 
the resolution means the churches will recognize each others 
members as believers in a single common faith said paul crow jr 
the president of the council on christian unity 
he said they will also work to coordinate the two churches 
social services and community functions 
about 6000 delegates attended the first day of business of the 
fiveday christian church disciples of christ general assembly 
officials said 
the united church of christ passed a similar resolution at its 
national convention in fort worth texas a month ago 
this is not a merger its not a uniting of the churches 
structure crow said this is setting up a common 
acknowledgement of each other 
the move means the two congregations can attend the same worship 
services but crow says local churches will maintain their own 
identities 
the disciples of christ and the united church of christ base 
their faith on the same christian doctrine crow said the two 
organizations already work together in much of their missionary 
endeavors but they differ in some worship practices and church 
policies he said 
one of those policies is a united church of christ clause that 
forbids church boards from considering sexual orientation of its 
ministers that means the church officially allows homosexuals to 
become ministers and forbids member churches from discriminating 
against them 
in putting our stamp of approval on this we are putting our 
stamp of approval on homosexuality said bethel nason of topeka 
kan her statements against the resolution brought a round of 
applause from delegates 
the resolution does not mention the issue of homosexuality 
disciples of christ delegate mike wolfe of spearman texas 
charged the united church of christ is far to the left both 
political and ecumenically 
but crow said the differences in social beliefs are as common 
within the christian church disciples of christ as they are 
between the two denominations 
the christian church allows for unity in diversity but that 
diversity need not divide us he said 
disciples president john o humbert also unveiled a model for a 
proposed 15 million building in downtown indianapolis that will 
house the churchs international offices he said construction is 
expected to be completed by 1992 
the christian church disciples of christ was formed in 1832 as 
part of an early frontier movement to unify christians the united 
church of christ was formed 32 years ago from other christian 
sects both organizations allow for varied opinions and stress 
freedom of interpretaton

the secretary of the navy on saturday 
denied that greenpeace protesters forced the navy to scrap a 
trident 2 missile launch off cape canaveral 
instead foreign flag ships prompted officials to call off 
fridays scheduled test said navy secretary h lawrence garrett 
the navy canceled the trident 2 test several hours after four 
greenpeace usa vessels penetrated the safety zone and chased a 
submarine involved in the test in the atlantic about 50 miles off 
the cape 
a statement issued by the navy said the launch was postponed 
because of intentional interference from foreign flag ships in a 
designated hazardous operational area some greenpeace vessels 
fly foreign flags 
we did not disrupt the proposed shot yesterday because of the 
greenpeace activity garrett said there were foreign flag 
vessels in the area its a normal precaution that we take and if 
we have to delay its still not going to disrupt the schedule 
greenpeace spokeswoman shannon fagan said two large greenpeace 
ships and two motorized rafts carrying antinuclear activists 
shadowed the launch submarine tennessee for hours in international 
waters 
safety regulations require that a countdown be stopped if 
nonessential boats come within about three miles of the submarine 
one raft was photographed beside the submarine 
the planned launch was to be the second underwater test firing 
of the trident 2 the navys newest most powerful weapon 
the first test march 21 ended in an explosion when the 237 
million missile pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was 
launched from the tennessee nineteen land launches 15 of them

hundreds of heads huddled close to the glossy 
photographs saturday and fingers furtively pointed out familiar 
faces and places 
this was no ordinary photography exhibit it was a record 
albeit partial of the biggest protests in communist china and 
many of the viewers took part 
look i know him one young girl whispered to a friend as 
they studied a photograph of student leaders addressing a crowd 
during the prodemocracy movement that is now officially condemned 
as an antisocialist rebellion 
the girl looked quickly around to see if anyone heard but no 
one seemed to be paying attention everyone had their own 
associations connected with the seven weeks of marches and sitins 
that ended june 34 when the army attacked hundreds and possibly 
thousands of people died 
the threeroom exhibit at the china art museum that opened 
friday afternoon was the latest in a series of official efforts to 
convince the public that the army acted correctly 
government books and television programs have given the official 
version of the events the military museum of the chinese peoples 
revolution has put tanks burned by protesters on display in its 
front courtyard along with several burned public buses used as 
street barricades against the armys advance 
the dramatic exhibit included pictures of soldiers recapturing 
tiananmen square where the students made their headquarters during 
the protests 
many pictures were shown for the first time in public no photo 
credits were given but they clearly were the work of military or

bodies on fire and the charred remains 
the exhibit did not contain any pictures of civilians wounded or

the army attack of thousands of deaths in the square and of the 
army burning bodies but few believe the government account that 
all the students left the square first and that no one was killed

delegates attending the first congress of chinese 
students in the united states on saturday created a fledgling 
national student union aimed at pressuring china for democratic 
reforms 
after lengthy debate and overnight revisions delegates ratified 
a constitution creating the allamerica chinese student union 
its not perfect enough but its really a very good start 
said ding jain chairman of the congress 
creation of the union was the main focus of the threeday 
congress which attracted chinese students from across the country 
a spokesman for the congress said 
the union will coordinate efforts to bring pressure on china to 
adopt prodemocratic reforms said pei minxin 31 a graduate 
student from harvard university and spokesman for the congress 
after ratifying the constitution the congress voted on a 
variety of proposed projects for the union to undertake the 
projects include lobbying governments for economic sanctions 
against china organizing boycotts against china and assuming joint 
management with the chinese journalist association of the weekly 
newspaper press freedom herald the paper was founded by a group of 
journalists in the united states on june 9 1989 
many of the proposals have been tried by individual student 
organizations before pei said but now with the establishment 
of this union there is a legitimacy a broadbased legitimacy to 
these efforts and conceivably we will attract more support from 
chinese students across america 
the unions creation was brought about by the june 34 army 
attack in beijing in which hundreds of prodemocracy demonstrators 
were killed in tiananmen square pei said 
chinese students in the united states believed there had to be 
other ways to change the government in their native country pei 
said 
why not choose another less costly message such as lobbying 
for these individual measures pei said 
conceivably chinese students will work through this 
organization to voice their prodemocratic ideas and opinions and 
also voice their protests against the human rights violations by 
the chinese government he said

president wojciech jaruzelski resigned 
saturday as communist party chief and was replaced by the outgoing 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski who has become a champion 
of conservative elements in the party 
in another apparent victory for party conservatives two 
hardliners were named to the ruling politburo in a shakeup that 
came on the last day of a communist party plenum 
four of the 18 politburo members and five of the nine party 
secretaries most reformers or linked to jaruzelski were 
dropped party spokesman janusz bisztyga called the move a drive 
for new faces 
in addition to quitting as party chief jaruzelski also resigned 
from the politburo and the policysetting central committee in what 
appeared to be an effort to show total commitment to the presidency 
jaruzelski had promised to resign as party chief a post he held 
since 1981 if he became president he was elected july 19 to the 
position created as part of reforms agreed to in talks this year 
between communist authorities and the solidarity trade union 
movement 
as president jaruzelski has control of the military and foreign 
policy matters and will choose a prime minister to head the 
government 
the official news agency pap said the gathering of the party 
central committee and party deputies of parliament elected rakowski 
171 to 41 to replace jaruzelski bisztyga said rakowski was the 
only candidate 
the selection of the 62yearold rakowski culminated a 
remarkable political rise by the politician who joined the 
politburo only in december 1987 after having been dropped from the 
government in 1985 along with several other hardliners 
the party is in a difficult situation but i believe i have 
support from thousands of party members rakowski told state 
television later i am aware of the importance of the job and i 
believe that we can find a way out of this difficult situation 
rakowski has been sharply criticized for the way he handled the 
economy during his nine months as prime minister 
but despite tripledigit inflation food shortages and his plan 
to rise food prices aug 1 rakowski was believed to have gathered 
support from hardliners and party members fearful of the growing 
influence of solidarity 
he is disliked by solidarity for his antagonism toward the union 
during the martiallaw crackdown of 1981 and for his decision last 
year to close the lenin shipyard where solidarity was founded nine 
years ago 
he was one of 33 senior officials who ran unopposed for 
parliament in june elections but failed to capture even half the 
votes he handed in his governments resignation last month after 
the new parliament was seated 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev immediately sent 
congratulations to rakowski saying cooperation between the soviet 
and polish parties will continue in spirit of party friendship 
and mutual understanding pap said 
the central committee conferred for several hours on who would 
be selected prime minister but made no announcement before 
adjourning late in the evening 
jaruzelski was to present his choice for prime minister to the 
parliament monday for approval 
potential candidates appeared to be politburo member wladyslaw 
baka deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula united peasant party 
leader roman malinowski and interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak 
baka quit friday as party secretary in charge of the economy 
after harshly criticizing rakowskis performance as prime minister 
his resignation was accepted during saturdays session 
it was unclear if he resigned to become prime minister or if he 
was leaving to protest the economic record of the rakowski 
government 
according to pap the plenum also adopted a resolution declaring 
the partys willingness to work with solidarity and with the 260 
solidarity lawmakers chosen in the june election 
solidarity now controls 99 of 100 seats in the new freely 
elected senate and 161 of the 460 seats in the sejm or parliament 
the resolution reaffirmed the partys january decision to 
legalize solidarity and defined conditions needed to improve 
the economy pap said without elaborating 
besides jaruzelski the central committee accepted politburo 
resignations from jozef czyrek kazimierz barcikowski stanislaw 
ciosek and alfred miodowicz miodowicz said he resigned because of 
wishes of members of the official trade union alliance opzz which 
he heads 
they were replaced by warsaw party chief janusz kubasiewicz and 
katowice party chief manfred gorywoda both hardliners and by 
leszek miller a party secretary who has been active in promoting 
the party to young people 
dropped as party secretaries were czyrek ciosek baka marian 
orzechowski and zygmunt czarzasty baka and orzechowski remain 
members of the politburo czarzasty had been brought in as a party 
secretary by jaruzelski as part of a new generation of reformers 
only seven months ago 
with the exception of miodowicz those dropped were reformers or 
closely linked to jaruzelski 
all of the departing officials said they resigned but it was 
not clear if their resignations all were voluntary pap said only 
that the resignations were accepted

tidal action erosion and oileating microbes 
could clean most of the oil from alaskas spilltainted shores 
within five years and the beaches could be normal again in 10 
years researchers said saturday 
speakers at a conference on the nations largest oil spill said 
the natural combination could clean up the spill without human 
efforts 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 and spilled 1092 
million gallons of crude in prince william sound the researchers 
based their conclusions on studies of previous oil spills with 
similar characteristics especially the amoco cadiz spill off the 
coast of france in 1976 
the researchers findings contradicted statements by coast guard 
vice adm clyde robbins the onsite coordinator of cleanup 
efforts robbins said friday that the beaches soiled by the spill 
are never going to be clean 
i would be very surprised to see a significant amount of oil 
in prince william sound in five years said john h 
vandermeulen a researcher at the bedford institute of oceanography 
at halifax nova scotia 
he and ronald atlas a microbiologist at the university of 
louisville said studies of the cadiz incident and other major 
spills showed that the ecology of the damaged areas appeared to 
have returned to normal within about 10 years 
the researchers used comparisons of fouled areas with similar 
but unspoiled environments to determine what constituted normal 
most environments i have seen have had recovery to some level 
of normalcy within five to 10 years vandermeulen said even 
heavily oiled marshes have recovered in 11 years 
the speed of natural cleanup by microbes is slowed by alaskas 
cold temperatures he said but the breakdown of crude oil and 
weathering of shores by wind and erosion continues 
atlas said oileating microbes exist in the area of the alaska 
spill in small numbers the environmental protection agency which 
has a research station in valdez has found that their numbers have 
increased since the spill he said 
atlas also said general degradation of the cadiz spill appeared 
to take around 10 years even if nothing else was done 
that rate is perhaps reasonable here he said 
oil degradation can be sped up with the use of fertilizers 
containing nitrogen and phosphorus a proposal that is being 
considered 
shore organisms that were destroyed by the spill would also come 
back fairly quickly vandermeusen said 
even if we wipe out every one there are larval ones off shore 
waiting to settle he said 
the experts spoke before an estimated 150 researchers attending 
a threeday conference on the effects of the oil spill on people 
animals and the environment 
the conference which ends sunday is sponsored by the national 
institute of environmental health sciences the national institute 
for occupational safety amp health and the environmental protection 
agency among others

a chinese army officer and his wife 
defected to south korea saturday through the demilitarized zone 
separating south korea and communist north korea the defense 
ministry reported 
a government intelligence source speaking on condition of 
anonymity identified the officer as maj zuo xiukai 40 a member 
of the chinese delegation to the korean military armistice 
commission the commission supervises the 1953 truce agreement that 
ended the korean war 
the source said zuo and his wife requested that they be allowed 
to go to a third country he said he did not know what country the 
couple preferred but speculated it would be either taiwan or the 
united states 
obviously they do not want to settle down here he said 
the seoul newspaper hankook ilbo quoted an unidentifed 
govenrment source as saying the couple probably defected because of 
their disapproval of the violent military crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last month in beijing 
the defense ministry reported they crossed the border into south 
korea from the truce village of panmunjom inside the demilitarized 
zone shortly after 11 am 
it said the two were under the protective custody of the 
americanled un command 
defense ministry spokesman brig gen yoon changro said command 
officials were questioning the officer and his wife and planned to 
transfer them to south korean authorities 
the un command includes representatives of the united states 
and 15 other nations that helped south korea after north korea 
invaded in 1950 the command has headquarters in the border village 
of panmunjom 35 miles north of seoul 
the government intelligence source said zuo was the 
fourthranking officer in the 12member chinese delegation to the 
armistice commission also based in panmunjom 
seoulbased foreign journalists who became acquainted with zuo 
at panmunjom said he speaks english and had served in the chinese 
embassies in india and britain before being assigned to panmunjom 
two years ago 
assistant foreign minister lee jungbin and other government 
officials met saturday to discuss the case 
the taiwanese embassy in seoul said it was in contact with south 
korean authorities some chinese air force pilots who in past years 
defected and landed their jet fighters in south korea were allowed 
to go to taiwan which is governed by the anticommunist 
nationalist chinese 
china which sent thousands of troops into korea to help north 
korea during the korean war was a signatory to the 1953 ceasefire 
that halted the conflict 
saturdays defection was believed to be the first by chinese 
through panmunjom 
in 1981 a czechoslovak enlisted soldier defected to south korea 
through the border village and three years later a soviet student 
crossed the border and sought asylum 
both eventually were allowed to go to the united states after 
being processed by a un refugee commission in rome

the exxon valdez edged toward san diego bay on 
saturday as the damaged tanker made its second attempt at entering 
the harbor for repairs 
but the valdez faced final navigational and environmental 
inspections before it would be allowed into the bay on sunday 
the ship that caused the nations worst oil spill was under tow 
saturday scheduled to reach the pilots buoy at the mouth of san 
diego bay late saturday said coast guard lt larry solberg 
since friday nights departure from waters near san clemente 
island 56 miles from here the ship has been under constant 
monitoring for the types of discharges that three weeks ago caused 
it to be turned away from san diego as a pollution risk 
under an agreement between exxon shipping co and five state 
agencies the valdez must be leakfree for a 24hour period prior 
to entering san diego bay en route to national steel and 
shipbuilding co for a ninemonth 25 million repair job 
exxon put up 20 million to ensure its performance and to cover 
the costs of a cleanup should a spill occur during the valdezs 
entry 
solberg said the ship successfully executed a series of steering 
and engine tests friday night and there were no visible signs of 
discharges 
the valdez assisted by tugboats was expected to come into the 
bay on its own power under the guidance of senior san diego harbor 
pilot capt edward silva jr 
meanwhile greenpeace activists said they would trail the valdez 
through the harbor with five sailboats and four inflatable craft in 
an onthewater protest 
were going to have a little flotilla out there but were not 
trying to block it in any way said greenpeace spokeswoman blair 
palese we want to demonstrate our concern and to bring public 
attention to the need for a longterm nontoxic energy policy 
solberg said the valdez would be surrounded by eight coast guard 
and harbor patrol vessels during the bay transit and a moving 
safety zone will be enforced 500 yards to the tankers front and 
300 yards from the sides and stern 
a final underwater inspection with a remote camera was planned 
when the ship arrived at the pilots buoy 
the purpose of the survey is to determine if the vessel 
sustained any bottom damage during its transit from san clemente 
island and to verify the vessel is in safe condition to transit san 
diego bay solberg said 
more than 100 tons of dangling steel plates were sheared when 
they tore loose from the hull framing during the ships 2500mile 
voyage from alaska where the vessel rammed a reef march 24 
the valdezs hull split open in the accident and almost 11 
million gallons of crude spilled into prince william sound the

five congressmen on committees that oversee 
defense spending helped raise money for a prodefense group from 
contractors who do business with the pentagon according to a 
published report 
the washington post in its sunday editions reported seven 
major defense contractors contributed 100000 each in tax 
deductible donations towards formation of the institute for the 
common defense after four of the congressmen one of them since 
deceased invited them to a dinner in the fall of 1987 
the congressmen included william dickinson of alabama the 
ranking republican on the house armed services committee a 
longtime friend and former business partner to icds president 
anthony s markris said the post 
joining dickinson in soliciting funds for the institute were 
sen phil gramm rtexas a member of the armed services committee 
sen j bennett johnson dla who sits on the appropriations 
defense subcommittee and the late rep bill chappell dfla then 
chairman of the subcommittee the newspaper reported 
dickinson and rep marvin leath dtexas invited the sponsoring 
firms to another fundraiser for the institute last may according 
to the post but the contractors decided to end their support when 
they learned no new contributors had been brought into the venture 
since the first appeal in 1987 
dickinson and leath also received speaking fees of 20000 and 
15000 respectively from several of the same companies that helped 
established the group the newspaper said 
the institutes stated goal was to publicize the value of the 
defense industry 
general dynamics donated to the group because there was a

a special prosecutor is investigating whether an 
aide to president bush violated federal ethics laws by failing to 
repay a 5000 loan a newspaper reported 
dan webb a former us attorney in chicago is trying to 
determine whether a 1984 loan to james w cicconi was legitimate or 
if it represented an illegal gift or bribe from executives of a 
troubled maryland mortgage company the chicago tribune reported in 
its sunday editions 
cicconi 37 runs the white house appointment office 
the newspaper reported that the balloontype loan from first 
american mortgage company was made in september 1984 for an 
original term of 90 days under the arrangement cicconi did not 
have to pay interest which amounted to 10 percent a year or 
principal until the loan expired and in december 1984 first 
american exercised an option clause that extended the loan for an 
additional year 
the mortgage company sought protection under federal bankruptcy 
laws in late 1985 and its owner and other executives later were 
convicted on federal charges of defrauding company investors of 
millions of dollars 
cicconis lawyer william b hundley said cicconi tried on 
several occasions after the extension expired in december 1985 to 
repay the loan and its accumulated interest but hundley said 
cicconi just couldnt get any information at all as to who owned 
the note or where to send the money 
the tribune said at least one former executive of the mortgage 
company has told investigators that an intermediary asked him to 
do him a favor and make this loan to cicconi and that it was 
not to be paid back presumably to win influence at the white 
house 
the intermediary an executive for a branch of a major wall 
street investment company has denied making such a request the 
newspapers sources said 
hundley said cicconi never talked to the intermediary himself 
and was preparing to quit his job in the reagan white house and 
enter private law practice at the time he sought the loan 
the newspaper said that a federal official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said evidence presented to a federal grand 
jury over the last six weeks appears to be supporting cicconis 
view that it is a legitimate loan 
the official said the inquiry which could last several more 
weeks may very likely not lead to the indictment of anybody 
it is my understanding that their probe has cleared cicconi 
of any wrongdoing and that theyre going to close it out very 
shortly hundley said 
cicconi declined through hundley to be interviewed 
hundley said he now is negotiating repayment terms with a 
trustee of the companys assests appointed recently by the 
bankruptcy court

israeli leaders on saturday dismissed criticism 
of israels abduction of a proiranian moslem cleric and said he 
led a fanatical group that had launched terrorist attacks on 
israel 
sheik abdul karim obeid allegedly linked to the capture of 
israeli soldiers in lebanon and the kidnapping of a us marine 
held hostage there was abducted friday from his south lebanon home 
and taken to israel in a helicopter 
there may be some people who voice disapproval but public 
opinion will understand that this act was taken against one of the 
leaders of one of the most fanatical groups in lebanon said 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner 
israel and us officials have said obeid is a leader of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah obeid has denied belonging to the group 
israel radio reported saturday that sheikh abbas musawi a 
hezbollah leader who lives in a southern suburb of beirut said the 
organization will not agree to a prisoner exchange and will 
increase attacks on israel 
the fundamentalist islamic hezbollah advocates the destruction 
of israel and its replacement by an iranianstyle islamic state 
in paris on saturday un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar called the israeli raid a violation of lebanese 
sovereignty he demanded israel return obeid 
egypt accused israel of state terrorism and said the kidnapping 
could lead to increased extremism and violence in the middle east 
prime minister hussein musavi of iran also called the abduction 
state terrorism he issued a statement in tehran saying these 
kinds of acts will further expand the righteous activities of 
lebanese moslems against israel and its phalange followers 
the phalange is a rightwing predominantly christian party in 
lebanon 
president bush said friday he could not condone the commando 
raid and did not know if it would help us marine lt col william 
r higgins one of 17 foreigners held hostage in lebanon 
british prime minister margaret thatcher criticized the 
kidnapping saying it could hurt the hostages 
pazner said saturday i dont remember hearing the same kind 
of indignation when sheik obeids people were involved in bloody 
terrorist attacks from south lebanon into israel 
the israeli army said obeid served as commander of hezbollah in 
south lebanon and that the group had organized at least 20 raids on 
israel and its allies in south lebanon 
yossi sarid a leftwing israeli legislator said the 
question is not what world public opinion is but if the raid is 
helpful in freeing our kidnapped soldiers 
three israeli troopers believed held in lebanon are soldiers 
rahamim alsheikh and yossi fink captured feb 17 1986 when 
guerrillas ambushed their patrol and air force navigator ron arad 
seized oct 16 1986 when his plane was shot down 
obeid is the most senior moslem shiite leader to be taken 
captive in recent months by israeli forces battling palestinian 
guerrillas and proiraninan fundamentalists in south lebanon 
there is no doubt in my mind that the idea here was to have a 
major exchange said aharon levran a private strategic analyst 
and brigadier general in the army reserves but i dont think 
they hezbollah will yield immediately and agree to an exchange 
they want him back as soon as possible but agreeing to a 
trade would show that israel has the upper hand so it wont take 
place immediately 
un spokesman timor goksel said israel is believed to hold 300 
lebanese in a prison in south lebanon run by the israelibacked 
south lebanon army militia 
lebanese security sources said friday that higgins was held 
briefly in obeids apartment after his abduction in february 1988 
while working as a un monitor on the israellebanon border 
seventeen foreign hostages are held in lebanon including nine 
americans the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

an 116 million hudguaranteed loan for a 
california housing project was approved after a campaign strategist 
for presidents bush and reagan intervened the new york times 
reported in its sunday editions 
lou kitchin who was reagans southern political director in 
1984 and was a senior campaign adviser to bush last year told the 
times he was paid about 30000 for his assistance on the san diego 
project 
documents obtained by the newspaper indicate regional officials 
of the department of housing and urban development had opposed the 
apartment complex for the elderly for economic reasons 
but they were overruled in 1987 by political appointees in 
washington the times said 
deborah gore dean a friend of kitchin who was then executive 
assistant to housing secretary samuel r pierce jr was involved 
in getting the project approved the times said 
an earlier report said kitchin received 40000 in consulting 
fees for an 11 million project in durham nc that converted a 
former hosiery mill into hudsubsidized apartments for the elderly 
one of that projects largest supporters was durham mayor 
charles markham who was a former law partner of pierce 
kitchin an atlantabased consultant has ties to reagan dating 
back to 1976 the times said 
kitchin told the times that he met repeatedly with ms dean 
you needed her help to understand what was going on at hud 
he said 
the times said ms dean declined to be interviewed 
kitchin said the san diego project was a good program that 
deserved federal support he said he was retained at the projects 
inception 
the developer of the 145apartment woodcrest retirement complex 
jack k jaynes told the times that kitchins intervention was 
essential to the success of the project 
jaynes said kitchin told me he would talk with somebody in 
washington that he was up there frequently that he knew all of 
these people 
jaynes said he remembered talking with kitchen about ms dean 
it was pretty plain that deborah dean was the power in the 
secretarys office jaynes told the times 
hud has been the subject of internal congressional and justice 
department investigations mismanagement and abuses have been found 
in a number of the multibilliondollar agencys programs 
kitchin however has attracted almost no attention from

sixyearold dooney waters lives in what 
prince georges county police and social service workers call a 
crack house 
the door that leads to the apartment is riddled with bullet 
holes and gaps that are usually stuffed with wads of paper or 
balledup socks where there once were locks 
drugs have wrecked my mother says dooney drugs have 
wrecked a lot of mothers and fathers and children and babies if i 
dont be careful drugs are going to wreck me too 
dooneys tale came in the first of two articles in sundays 
editions of the washington post 
the post said a reporter and photographer spent more than two 
months this spring chronicling dooneys life in a washington 
heights apartment complex that prince georges county police have 
identified as one of the most active drug markets in landover 
dooney is the childs nickname waters is his legal surname 
my mother dont take care of me dooney said during an 
interview with the newspaper in late may all she want is drugs 
addie lorraine waters 32 described herself as a slave to 
cocaine she told the newspaper she allowed drug dealers to use 
her apartment in exchange for steady support of her habit 
the apartment is in a neighborhood where more than a dozen 
slayings occurred last year but there are no locks on the front 
door so addicts and drug dealers have easy access 
dooney now lives in the district with his father a federal 
employee who asked not to be identified 
i just couldnt let him stay in a place like that said 
dooneys father who himself served prison time for a drug 
conviction but has been separated from dooneys mother for three 
years 
there was no one watching over him he said 
at home where dooney was burned when a woman tossed boiling 
water at his mothers face in a drug dispute the boy was painfully 
shy 
but teachers described dooney as exhaustively outgoing in school 
where they said he often begged to be taken to their homes they 
said he once asked if he could stay overnight in his classroom 
dooney was at home but asleep when his brother frank russell 
west 13 was shot in the left shoulder 
his mother didnt press charges against edward june powell 
the man police charged with shooting russell she said powell who 
is out on bail was trying to shoot someone else adding that 
russell still considers him a friend 
everybody knows about the drugs at my house dooney said 
with a matteroffact tone not common to a firstgrader the 
police know too but they dont do nothing about it dont nobody 
do nothing about it he said 
prince georges county police said they know about waters 
operation but have never found enough drugs in the apartment to 
charge her or others 
the problem is that drugs dont last long up there said 
officer alex bailey who patrols the washington heights 
neighborhood they use them up as soon as they arrive

every year more country towns are cut off from 
basic services ranging from medical care to bus transportation 
without which people look elsewhere for a place to live in the 
second part of an ap extra series rural crossroads southeast 
regional reporter strat douthat examines the reasons and the 
results focusing on a oncethriving kentucky town 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when emma alexander harks back to the days 
of her youth she sees this western kentucky border community as it 
was then a bustling little railroad town a place of high hopes 
and promise 
if only todays young people could see what it was like back 
then the 96yearold woman says 
why we had 22 greyhound buses stopping here every day and 
the trains land sakes they stopped here every hour it seemed 
like we had four department stores in guthrie the streets were 
always full of people 
now like thousands of other small towns across the country 
guthrie has been bypassed by the railroads by the bus lines by 
prosperity 
and the young people looking at now not then and seeing no 
career jobs no reason to stay on flee as soon as they finish 
high school 
james golden is one of those who fled 
first the movie theater closed shortly after i finished 
school 25 years ago then we lost our high school to 
consolidation the trains stopped coming after that more recently 
we lost our bus service then last year the elementary school was 
closed 
hettie louise griffey a retired teacher said she like to 
cried when they took away our little school its been one thing 
after another 
such losses take a terrible toll on the quality of life in a 
small community and unfortunately says golden now the research 
director for the national association of counties in washington 
dc guthrie has become a paradigm for whats happened to many 
country places in the united states 
its sad what has befallen our rural communities he said 
guthrie was a transfer point on the louisville amp nashville 
railroad its the birthplace of robert penn warren the pulitzer 
prizewinning writer 
it used to be a proud little town but now theres almost no 
hope of bringing in new industry or reviving the spirit of the 
community golden said 
the plight of these troubled towns cant be traced to a single 
cause but golden cites two recent blows the deregulation of the 
transportation industry in the early 80s and the end in 1985 of 
federal revenue sharing which provided millions for smalltown 
projects 
with deregulation the airlines and bus lines pulled out and 
many communities became increasingly isolated as they lost their 
daily links to the wider world he said 
a 1986 study by the interstate commerce commission showed that 
no fewer than 4514 points lost bus service between november 1982 
and january 1986 by 1986 more than 10000 of the nations 18000 
named communities were totally without service 
and the end of revenue sharing has meant a loss of many 
essential public works projects and a cutback in those social 
services so important in holding together a community golden 
said 
a national association of counties study earlier this year 
examining the impact of lost revenue sharing on 28 kentucky 
counties found widespread cuts in senior citizens programs parks 
and recreation spending and fire police and ambulance services 
our small towns are losing hope said golden were trying 
to get a new initiative for rural development from congress 
something needs to be done 
guthrie mayor john coke couldnt be more in agreement 
when they took away revenue sharing we lost 20 percent of our 
budget coke said and were talking about the part that really 
hurt 
as a result he said the towns two police cars have well over 
100000 miles each on their odometers with no funds to replace 
them other services are being maintained at marginal levels 
he shook his head sadly as he surveyed the towns main street 
now dotted with sagging empty storefronts and even emptier 
sidewalks 
back in our heyday the streets were always busy said coke 
salesmen would come to guthrie park their cars and take the 
trains because the connections were so good we had three active 
hotels then 
now about all thats left of downtown is a drugstore a 
funeral home a hardware store an auto parts store and a furniture 
store thats going out of business 
the town he said is full of railroad retirees and their 
widows he acknowledged theres little to hold the young people 
except maybe the prospect of a job in the local sewing factory or 
wood treatment plant 
and who wants that asked 18yearold sarah harper of nearby 
allensville im in college i come home to work during the 
summer but ive got no intention of staying here theres nothing 
here but farm work or a lowlevel factory job nothing youd want 
to spend your life doing 
as a result guthries 1800 residents like those in other 
small rural towns tend to be older than the national median and 
at a time in their lives when residents need ready access to 
medical services guthrie has only a parttime clinic staffed by 
two general practitioners who work out of a mobile home 
from 1980 to 1988 208 rural hospitals closed according to the 
american hospital association some 130 rural counties with a 
total population of more than 500000 have no active physicians 
the american medical association said 
we once had seven doctors here recalled emma alexander 
whose late husband ran a busy service station back in the 1930s 
when guthrie was on the main route between chicago and florida 
they called us the crossroads of the world back then she 
said you could go anywhere on a train you could get a train to 
nashville three or four times before noon every day now if i 
want to go to the doctor over in clarksville tenn ive got to 
pay somebody to take me 
theres no taxi service here but a local woman has a van and 
shell take you the 18 miles down to clarksville sometimes it 
costs me 25 to 30 to go see the doctor 
coke points out that todd county provides guthries elderly and 
indigent with onceaweek bus service to russellville the county 
seat but he says most people would be stuck if they didnt have a 
car or a neighbor to drive them 
the town started to decline after it was bypassed by the 
highway and train passenger service began to fall off said 
robert penn warren who long ago left to settle in connecticut now 
84 the novelist and poet was born in the countryside near guthrie 
and moved to town when he was very young 
my father went there because of the opportunity he said 
he was the president of a small bank i went to school in guthrie 
and i can still remember the excitment of the trains stopping at 
all hours of the day and night i moved away but my late brother 
stayed and built a big grain elevator there 
when his brother was alive warren said he used to return home 
frequently now like everyone else he has little reason to go to 
guthrie the onetime crossroads of the world

when it comes to a football or basketball 
game rockwell is the enemy around here but when it comes to a 
more critical issue survival old rivals are new allies 
these two communities have decided that united they stand 
divided they fall into the bleak landscape of ghost towns littering 
americas heartland 
so thornton rockwell and five other hamlets have formed a 
cluster called the area community commonwealth one of a 
growing number of such programs in iowa that aim to keep small 
towns alive by sharing classrooms workers or equipment and pooling 
resources to attract business 
its going to take a joint effort to save our schools and save 
our main streets said chris nannenga the commonwealths 
founder we realized weve got to do something to stop our 
erosion basically our only solution is to work together 
about 17 iowa clusters have been or are being formed one 
along interstate 80 others within counties to offset the 1980s 
rural economic decline that has seen farmers lose their land 
merchants lose their stores and hardworking people lose their 
dreams 
if youre sitting in a town of 500 and you start talking 
about economic and community development your options are so 
limited said tim borich an iowa state university rural 
development specialist working with some of the clusters 
what were really doing is redefining what community is 
and dispelling some of the fatalism maybe if we work together we 
can keep the boat afloat yet 
the area community commonwealth the first cluster formed in 
1986 besides thornton and rockwell the groups towns are 
sheffield dougherty swaledale chapin and meservey 
for years the communities were divided by athletic and economic 
rivalries vying for trophies and business dollars there was not 
a sense of common good nannenga said it was all for you none 
for me 
most of the towns had struggled with shrinking school 
enrollments the dominolike closings of hardware stores factories 
and taverns and the shopping exodus to mason city which is large 
enough to support a k mart and walmart 
young people left said gene persons a grocer and the 
commonwealth treasurer unemployment was high peoples attitudes 
were down 
it happened all across iowa almost half the gas stations and 
nearly a third of the states groceries closed from 1976 to 88 
said ken stone an iowa state economist 
one big obstacle is most small towns dont have enough money to 
hire experts to lure industry nor enough voters to wield much 
political influence 
the commonwealth towns separate populations for example range 
from 128 to about 1200 but as a group 6500 people give us a 
little more leverage to be listened to in the legislature 
persons said 
the groups biggest coup was last years 60th birthday 
celebration for mickey mouse organized with the walt disney co a 
muchpublicized giant silhouette of mickeys head visible from the 
air was created by meticulous surveying and planting in a 530acre 
corn and oat field between sheffield and dougherty 
transcontinental airline pilots pointed it out to their surprised 
passengers 
disney worked with the towns to hold a twoday party in august 
in sheffield which drew 45000 people the commonwealth netted 
abut 48000 profits from tshirts and hats and other concessions 
other projects are much smaller such as a grade sharing program 
in which two school districts exchange junior high and high school 
students filling classrooms and saving money 
two towns share a police officer and some small retail outlets 
have set up satellite stores so residents dont have to travel 20 
miles to get film developed or buy vegetables or hardware 
theres no more us vs them 
weve turned a winlose situation into a winwin situation 
nannenga said 
an industrial park also was established in rockwell in 1988 and 
a small water bottling company has opened receiving a 30000 loan 
from a 50000 state grant the commonwealth received a company 
that makes equipment that picks up recyclable products is 
considering moving there 
we cant handle the industries that are going to employ 150 to 
200 people nannenga admitted we dont have the housing we 
dont have the infrastructure we may not be able to sell washing 
machines but we can fix them 
practicality is an important part of a clusters success said 
kathy beery iowas rural development coordinator if you have 
some unrealistic goals its going to be very frustrating you dont 
want to come together just because youre desperate perhaps 
theres some natural resource they can build on or perhaps some 
existing business 
five communities in a cluster north of des moines are doing 
that developing a nature trailbiking corridor shared by three of 
the towns 
we dont want to lose the spirit of competition yet we 
want to capitalize on cooperation said mayor howard hammond of 
slater one of the towns this is the only way were going to 
survive

worn by long hours and weary of watching the 
town shrink bill brzezinski threw in the towel on his silver spur 
cafe 18 months ago selling off the only restaurant in this dusty 
west texas hamlet 
like the hardware store the gas station the grocery and so 
many others in so many towns in so many parts of rural america the 
silver spur soon failed and brzezinski figured roby wasnt far 
behind 
but today an unusual economic development plan has begun to 
breathe new life into this onestoplight town a new retirement 
center has opened and because of aggressive promotion coveys of 
quail hunters now flock to fisher county 
even the silver spur is going to shine again brzezinski is 
renovating the cafe and bringing it back from the dead this fall 
convinced that the hungry hunters who come from 26 states for the 
fourmonth season will help the town of 814 and its only 
restaurant survive 
our attitude has changed he said this is what has 
inspired me to do it again 
whats happening in fisher county is held up across remote areas 
as an innovative approach to saving dying towns yet even here 
after a handful of small successes the future remains mostly 
bleak and experts say the situation underscores just how difficult 
it is to revitalize rural america 
we have slowed the departure rate but honestly we havent 
stopped it or reversed it said david morris chairman of the 
countys economic development commission all this is for naught 
unless we find the key to repopulating rural america 
three years ago fisher countys leaders declared a crisis if 
they didnt do something the county would die typical of small 
rural towns across the country the population had already declined 
44 percent over 10 years to just 5000 storefronts were boarded 
up people especially the young moved to the cities 
we were kind of desperate no doubt about it said richard 
spencer the county agriculture extension agent who brought 
together the local leaders 
they rounded up state and national experts on economic 
development and sought their advice 
they created the fisher county economic development commission 
and they made one key decision go for all the little projects they 
could think of not one big project 
everyone thinks that general motors is going to come drop a 
factory in here or the b2 stealth bomber program will drop in 
here that doesnt happen and thats the common mistake rural 
people make said morris a specialist on developing third world 
nations who retired to run a motel here 
the result has become a creative if unconventional model for 
rural economic development 
they have less money and resources to work with and yet after 
10 years of decline now theyve got new money coming in said 
david guarino of the texas department of agriculture which has 
provided a grant for the quail hunting effort if they can do it 
you can do it all over 
the commission has set out to revive this depressed cattle 
cotton and oil area by promoting it as a retirement spot drawing 
tourists and finding ways to keep citizens from leaving 
two commission members bought an abandoned nursing home and 
helped find new owners who have refurbished it its now the 
countys only retirement center even though 60 percent of the 
population is over age 55 
realizing fisher county had texas largest quail population the 
commission formed a quailhunting cooperative which in its first 
year brought in 140 hunters and an estimated 100000 of new 
spending 
one hundred thousand dollars is an attentiongetter in this 
town said billy don atkinson a robybased federal agriculture 
official who helps run the coop 
and in fisher county theyll try anything 
the commission is hoping to build a memorial garden for slain 
police officers and turn an abandoned electric train depot into a 
museum to draw tourists theyre trying to raise money and serve 
the large povertylevel population with a food bank and 
usedclothing store theyve helped open a recreational vehicle 
park 
the group even formed the national domino association and played 
host to a firstever national tournament 
not all of the ideas are working 
the domino idea while fun hasnt produced much money and will 
probably be cut back the law enforcement monument has drawn a 
15acre land donation but has only 400 in the bank 
time is short doom is just around the corner said the rev 
alvin petty the leader of the commissions tourism task force 
weve only got three or four more years to achieve a great deal 
because were losing 8 percent of our population a year 
commission officials say they now know that their smallscale 
endeavors are simply setting the stage for necessary larger 
development we have prepared the table but we havent gotten to 
the meat and potatoes morris said 
and help will have to come from washington he believes in the 
form of a modern homestead act that would once again encourage 
people to return to rural areas 
until we get that kind of public policy the rest of this is 
mickey mouse if they dont put that structure in place all of 
rural america will be blowing in the wind

don cherry is going back to his roots neneh 
cherry is still developing hers 
he moves and speaks in the rhythms of cool jazz spontaneous and 
refined she is warm and downtoearth with just a hint of the 
passion and hot funk generated by her hit single buffalo 
stance 
his peers include jazz greats ornette coleman and miles davis 
hers are such pop royalty as prince and madonna 
but listen closely and a similar spirit can be heard what don 
cherry might refer to as world music or what neneh cherry 
would call positive energy 
don is nenehs stepfather and they share a common outlook on 
life and music they talked recently about their music and lives in 
an interview at nenehs midtown manhattan apartment 
its wonderful whats happening said don cherry the jazz 
trumpeter who has just released art deco his first studio 
album of straight jazz in over two decades 
the whole planet has this connection of music and sound 
russia and japan and africa everyones trying to express 
themselves in the past three years theres been a lot of energy 
and acceptance of things fresh 
he includes nenehs raw like sushi album in that category 
what nenehs doing in music is what all people can relate to 
the whole planet theres a lot of things happening now that are a 
blessing i hear nenehs songs on the radio thats a blessing and 
all of us feel that way its a new generation 
the cherrys trade compliments with ease and joy celebrating 
their music and each other don sees nenehs career as a 
continuation of her happy upbringing 
nenehs always been a person to be with people he said 
shes always socialized thats her karma so many people are 
making records where they do everything the drum parts and all i 
dont think neneh could be like that she enjoys working with 
people 
neneh was born in 1964 and grew up in sweden and new york 
leaving school at age 14 after appearing in a number of 
underground bands she began working on raw like sushi last 
year 
music has always been natural to me she said but i 
didnt really make the decision to get involved with it until i was 
involved with working in a group 
musics always been there like a way of life always but i 
didnt start writing any material until i was out of two band 
situations i took everything i had learned from the rest of my 
life and did something with it 
buffalo stance combines rock jazz funk and disco 
the best blessing ive had in my life is feeling i dont have 
to define the various influences now were going to do a reggae 
song a jazz song in cat on a hot tin roof paul newmans 
saying i need the click in my head then ill feel all right 
at some point a few years ago i got that click its given 
me the freedom to make songs were in tune to where the raw energy 
is 
the next generation is a track off raw sushi neneh a 
mother of two is already thinking of a world far removed from the 
dance floors where her music is heard 
when you have a child all of life and all children begin to 
matter in a different way she said it opened me up children 
are not being given the right information and they need to learn 
you become aware of education don added when neneh was 
growing up we started visiting schools ourselves thats what 
education is not in material things or this false love the most 
important thing you can give kids is yourself 
don cherry born in 1936 grew up in the watts section of los 
angeles and was soon exposed to billie holliday charlie parker and 
other jazz legends like neneh music was more important than 
school and he began cutting classes for the chance to jam with 
local musicians 
he was just 17 when he started playing with coleman the alto 
sax player who helped develop free jazz which relied on 
spontaneous interaction between musicians rather than extended 
solos 
in the late 1950s cherry was part of the coleman quartet whose 
engagement at new yorks five spot cafe attracted worldwide 
attention 
he also played with sonny rollins and john coltrane and made his 
first visit to the third world in the mid60s going from 
copenhagen to morocco and soon incorporated new sounds into his 
music 
you look at the catalogs in the record stores he said 
the jazz department new wave fusion new age its all coming 
together its world music 
were growing as listeners and as players too weve become 
more aware of what we have to work with jazz has gotten to be a 
gumbo americas a gumbo its good to know about each others 
culture its one of the greatest forms of education and its 
happening in all of music 
for art deco he plays with just three other musicians all 
longtime friends tenor saxophonist james clay bassist charlie 
haden and drummer billy higgins 
they recorded 10 songs including three coleman numbers the 
blessing when will the blues leave and compute the 
standards body and soul and ive grown accustomed to your 
face and the title track a cherry composition 
it was a pleasure he said we had the best engineer in 
jazz rudy van gelder the producer john snyder had his heart in 
it and the musicians had been playing together we played at the 
village vanguard for one week and at the end of the week we started 
recording 
its a pure jazz record 
the cherrys talk excitedly about working together and recording 
each others material both see music as a way of communication 
music is good that way don said a lot of people dont 
handle music because it makes you compoletely nude you play music 
and you can find a whole persons innerself when youre creating 
and improvising you have to be real honest 
neneh spoke of her song manchild and how it expressed her 
idea of personal growth its about a man who feels inadequate 
feels he has to establish himself materially in a certain kind of 
way 
you see a lot of people aggressive people who are macho 
because theyre insecure im in touch with myself and im 
getting to know myself more

like that friend of yours who regularly embarks 
on slimandtrim diets american industry is doing its thing again 
it is seeking to slice poundage from its bureacracy the better to 
court the consumer 
some of the biggest companies in america are doing it usually a 
company is measured large because of its sales and earnings in 
this instance some of the them are large also because of their 
bulging midriffs 
faced with competition that seems to grow more intense as 
foreigners invade each others markets companies are cutting much 
of their excess baggage plants products and people 
almost all the bigname companies the kind that seek to sell 
worldwide are doing it not all of them are american companies 
either 
the currency advantage that once gave japanese firms an edge in 
exports is greatly reduced now so they must become even more 
efficient europe may become a vast common market in 1992 adding 
greatly to competitiveness there 
but its an old story in the united states there was little 
industrial fat to be found in american companies right after world 
war ii but the easy days of the 1960s took care of that waste and 
inefficiency developed 
by the 1970s american companies were finding themselves at a 
competitive disadvantage the industrial might of europe and japan 
destroyed in the war was much newer and more technologically 
efficient than american factories 
the effect was shocking the products of the bloated 
bureaucracies and dated factories of america were undercut by 
foreign products shipped thousands of miles to showrooms foreign 
quality steadily improved while americas fell 
that shocking experience brought on a crash diet old factories 
were closed layers of whitecollar workers were eliminated 
billions of dollars were spent on new production facilities 
nonessential units were sold off 
that desperate diet of the 1970s had much to do with the success 
of american business in the 1980s but success it seems has its 
dangers the worst of them complacency bureaucratic baggage has 
accreted again 
no company no matter how great its reputation is immune 
oldtimers such as international business machines corp and the big 
three automakers postwar phenoms such as digital equipment corp 
and polaroid corp and upstart apple computer inc 
after a terrible start the decade of the 1980s has the 
appearance of the 1960s all over the economy has grown 
unemployment has dropped and inflation and interest rates are under 
control again and the fat has developed 
just 10 years after having been rescued from the edge of 
bankruptcy and after having cut expenses to the bone chrysler 
corp is now forced to go on crash diet that it hopes will save 
1 billion by the end of 1990 
the proposed cuts reveal where the fat had grown chryslers 
whitecollar work force up about 50 percent in six years would be 
reduced by 2300 staffers cost cuts in materials would be sought 
production would be streamlined 
there is nothing new in such goals in theory such efficiencies 
are part of the unrelenting pursuit of good management in 
practice especially when times are comfortable both theory and 
practice fall into disuse 
what awakens both of them is competition and competiton now is 
global rather than regional or national the route to the 
consumers heart isnt is nationality but price and quality 
only the slimmest and trimmest can offer it

the courts turned him down wall street turned 
its back on him so paramount chairman martin davis scrapped his 
122 billion hostile offer for time vindicating the media giants 
plan to merge with warner 
but the story of paramount communications incs sevenweeklong 
struggle for time inc did not end last week when davis dropped his 
bid and time completed its 14 billion tender offer for warner 
communications inc 
the next chapters revealing what happens to these three 
sprawling entertainmentcommunications companies will unfold 
months and years from now 
time chairman j richard munro is both optimistic and cautious 
about the future of the company that will be known as time warner 
inc 
weve got nothing but healthy businesses he said weve 
acquired a company thats on an incredible roll 
nonetheless munros company also has taken on an estimated 13 
billion in debt to complete the deal that will crimp some of time 
warners plans 
this is going to make it a little tougher on us munro said 
in a telephone interview we are going to probably not be as 
aggressive as we might be without that debt 
times plans overseas which it hoped to expand through the 
warner deal could be limited because of the amount of money the 
company owes some of that will take capital we wont have 
munro said some things we would have liked to have done will 
take a little longer to get to 
after paramount launched its bid some observers theorized davis 
did not actually want to acquire time and knew hed fail but 
hoped to sabotage time warners competitive advantage 
regardless of davis motivation he did force time to acquire 
warner through debt rather than stock said fred anschel an 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc it does limit time 
warners financial flexibility over the next year or two 
paramounts offer forced time and warner to transform their 
planned stockswap merger into a 70 a share tender offer by time 
for warner the only way time could pay for warners 200 million 
shares was to borrow 
but munro and warner chairman steven j ross who will corun 
the company evidently dont expect debt to slow them down too much 
you chew on the debt not by cutting creativity or firing 
people but by growth munro said 
first on times agenda is to decide the breakdown of cash and 
securities it will exchange for the 98 million warner shares not 
purchased in the cash tender offer whats known as the back 
end of the merger the amount of cash involved and how much if 
any debt securities time issues will help determine the size of 
time warners debt load 
time and warner expect to repay that debt through cash flow an 
accounting term that refers to the money generated by their 
business but while the companies stated in june that no asset 
sales were planned as a result of the merger they sound less 
resolute now that theyve got a done deal 
published reports have said time and warner were considering 
selling times scott foresman book publisher and warners cable 
television operations 
munro said he could not imagine a sale of either business but 
added we really dont know what were going to do until we get 
the back end together and refine the cash flows 
we would try very hard not to sell assets munro said 
well know within six months 
some observers doubt whether ross and munro two strong 
personalities will be able to get along sharing the top job 
that will be determined but we know each other awful well 
munro said 
both executives negotiated the merger resolving differences 
over two years of talks and weathered paramounts assault on their 
plans munro claimed the pair survived that without one harsh 
word 
ross has served as a cochief executive once before he shared 
the top spot at warner with william frankel from 1967 until 
frankels death in 1971 
were putting together two companies that are so healthy it 
makes it easier munro said the debt makes it a bit more 
difficult but we really feel thats manageable 
analysts believe the debt will cushion time warner from any 
hostile bids at least for a while but plenty of speculation 
remains about what will happen to paramount which has an enormous 
amount of cash 
only a few days after the failed bid for time paramount sold 
its financial services business to ford motor co for 335 
billion strengthening its ability to buy other companies 
its simply a question of who theyre going to go after and 
if they dont whos going to go after them said anschel the 
dean witter analyst 
paramount chairman davis was undaunted in defeat although his 
aggressive run at time flopped last week before the highest court 
in delaware where all three companies are incorporated 
the threejudge supreme court panel upheld a lower court ruling 
that affirmed times right to pursue its longsought merger with 
warner and told paramount it had no business interfering 
we believe in making bold moves when they are in the best 
interest of paramount communications shareholders davis stated 
after the supreme court ruled we have just demonstrated that in 
our offer for time 
davis said paramount would continue its expansion plans through 
acquisitions mergers joint ventures or partnerships but analysts 
have predicted his future targets would be on a smaller scale than 
time 
the company refused to comment on the possibility that it could 
find itself the target of suitor 
during the seven weeks that time and warner fought paramount 
the stock market was rife with rumors that bidders would emerge for 
any or all of the three combatants their stock prices gyrated as 
the reports came and went but no bids were announced 
still the failure of paramounts bid is an interesting study of 
how wall street itself studies an offer 
after paramount announced its bid on june 6 the stock market 
bid time shares up from 126 to a high of 18275 but professional 
speculators and their own lawyers assessed paramounts chances and 
saw that davis would lose and began to dump their time holdings 
as the weeks wore on time stock spiraled downward reaching 
about 136 as the supreme court heard the final arguments in the 
case

autoworker unionists in tennessee and automaker 
executives in detroit are finding they have a lot in common both 
know what its like to get their snouts snapped by japan 
the united auto workers union suffered a stunning defeat this 
past week at the nissan motor corp plant in smyrna tenn where 
workers voted 2to1 to reject uaw representation despite an 
intensive and often bitter union campaign that began in january 
1988 
not only did the rejection signal a repudiation of the uaws 
union yes drive at the 6yearold plant but it also was seen 
as a sign that american workers are increasingly accepting japanese 
management techniques 
nissans smyrna workers who produce light trucks and sentra 
sedans make the same money as uaw counterparts elsewhere and none 
has ever been laid off making it difficult for the union to find 
an effective campaign issue the uaw blamed the defeat on what it 
called nissans systematic antiunion rhetoric 
the vote was big news in japan where companies that rely 
heavily on sales in the us market particularly automakers have 
been building more factories in the united states both to thwart 
charges of trade protectionism and to gain a stronger presence in 
this country 
so far no transplanted japanese auto factory has been organized 
by the uaw and the smyrna vote intensified speculation that the 
countrys largest union will face more trouble plugging the holes 
in its declining membership 
the union wasnt the only one smarting from japans influence on 
the automaking industry 
five hundred miles north of smyrna in detroit two of the big 
three reported lower secondquarter earnings because of declining 
domestic sales and a third announced a 1 billion costcutting 
effort partly the result of aggressive japanese competition 
general motors corp said earnings fell 3 percent from a year 
earlier to 145 billion and ford motor co said earnings fell 15 
percent to 14 billion industry analysts said the rebates offered 
by the carmakers not only failed to lure enough buyers but eroded 
whatever earnings were left 
chrysler corp which is to report earnings monday confronted 
perhaps a more serious problem of growing costs evoking memories 
of gloomy days several years ago when the company needed federal 
loan guarantees to stay alive 
the no 3 automakers chairman lee iacocca widely credited with 
resurrecting chrysler told top managers the company was too fat 
and they needed to cut 2300 whitecollar workers from the payroll 
by yearend 
a slump in the auto business has been expected for a while and 
many industry analysts foresee drastically lower earnings at the 
big three over the remainder of 1989 and perhaps 1990 the 
automakers themselves have indicated they agree with that 
assessment 
in one telling sign this past week ford bought paramount 
communications incs profitable financial services business for 
335 billion cash the purchase was seen as part of fords attempt 
to protect itself from dependence on selling cars to make money 
elsewhere in business and economic news this past week 
bigger evidently is better in the drug business bristolmyers 
co and squibb corp agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at 
about 11 billion creating one of the largest pharmaceutical 
companies the agreement came a day after smithkline beckman corp 
and britains beecham plc completed their previously announced 
merger 
time inc completed its merger with warner communications inc 
after delawares highest court blocked paramount communications 
hostile takeover attempt of time the courts decision was seen as 
a major victory for corporate directors whose longterm plans may 
conflict with the wishes of shareholders 
more evidence of a slowing economy emerged boosting stock and 
bond prices the government said its broadest measure of economic 
growth showed a 17 percent gain this spring well below 
expectations economists said the federal reserve which has taken 
steps to ease credit would likely continue to do so in order to 
avert a possible recession 
exxon corp said the cost of cleaning the alaskan oil spill 
would exceed 125 billion and was responsible for a plunge in its 
secondquarter earnings the disclosure coincided with a fivemonth 
low in the price of oil which had been driven higher by fears of 
shortages that followed the march 24 spill

after a long time circling the runway on 
dwindling power the once highflying economy finally may be 
touching down 
stock market investors have braced for a possibly difficult 
landing by favoring companies that can turn a profit regardless of 
economic conditions and dumping ones apt to be bumped around during 
impact 
the economy probably started on its final approach to the runway 
during the second quarter when growth eased considerably to a 17 
percent annual pace 
many analysts regarded the report issued this past week on the 
gross national product the broadest gauge of economic activity 
as a signal that the economy has sufficient power for the 
soughtafter soft landing a period of slow but sustained 
growth with falling inflation and interest rates 
this analysis helped various stock market measures scale to 
record heights during the week on friday the standard amp poors 
500stock index climbed to 34215 and the new york stock exchange 
composite index advanced to 19038 both alltime highs 
for all of the week the market made some impressive progress 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials finished the week at 
263524 just 019 point below the postcrash high reached 
thursday up 2788 points for the week and just about 87 points shy 
of its all time high of 272242 set in august 1987 
the nyse composite index rose 323 to 19038 the nasdaq 
composite index for the overthecounter market added 353 to 
45282 and the american stock exchange market value index was up 
323 at 37451 
volume on the big board averaged 17962 million shares a day up 
slightly from 17590 million a day the previous week 
one force driving the market onward was evidence that the 
federal reserve was fluffing the credit cushion to make the 
economys landing more comfortable the central bank took steps 
this past week to loosen shortterm interest rates 
declining interest rates bode well for the stock and bond 
markets says greg a smith of prudentialbache securities inc 
hundreds of billions of dollars now invested in money market funds 
in the united states could go elsewhere if rates continue to fall 
any further drops in shortterm interest rates as the fed 
shifts policy for recession prevention could also unleash a fairly 
powerful flow of money into longerterm financial assets such as 
stocks and bonds he wrote in a weekly market strategy report 
a look at recent wall street trends indicates investors have 
been discriminating in their selections stocks of companies with 
earnings swings during business cycles such as automakers have 
performed weakly for some time while more recessionproof 
companies such as foodmakers and consumer product companies have 
fared better 
the market is really penalizing those companies that will be 
bothered by a recession says john d connolly of dean witter 
reynolds inc 
but connolly says he sees two chief reasons why a sluggish 
economic growth wont deteriorate into a serious downturn with 
widespread layoffs and significant income shrinkage 
most importantly he says the central bank has ample leeway to 
lower interest rates without stirring up inflation 
theres no reason why the fed has to stay tight says 
connolly in prior recessions the fed felt it couldnt loosen 
because its job on inflation wasnt working 
the second safeguard is that consumers already have made major 
progress in replenishing their savings depleted during the longest 
economic expansion in the postworld war ii era connolly contends 
a government report released friday showed the personal savings 
rate savings as a percent of disposable income rose to 59 
percent in june well above the sub3percent rates that prevailed 
a few years ago 
part of the function of a recession is to reliquify the 
consumer says connolly the consumer is already partially 
reliquified

bank of america is lowering its prime 
lending rate to 10 percent because of its own declining borrowing 
costs and further signs of a weakening economy and analysts say 
other banks should quickly follow 
the move effective monday follows chase manhattan bank which 
dropped its prime on july 10 by the same half percentage point the 
decline was the second in as many months bringing the prime rate 
to the level at which it stood at the start of 1989 
analysts said they expected most other major banks to quickly 
lower their prime to the same level bank of america is the 
nations secondlargest bank 
they werent the first and they wont be the last said 
stock analyst j richard fredericks with montgomery securities in 
san francisco 
bank of america chief economist john oliver wilson cited the 
falling federal funds rate the rate banks charge each other for 
overnight loans and signs of a slowing economy as the main 
reasons for the move which was announced friday 
the prime a laggard among other interest rates is a benchmark 
banks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and business 
credit including homeequity lines of credit it also determines 
the rate for many credit cards 
wilson said the federal reserve board has shown signs of 
loosening its grip on the nations money supply in reaction to a 
continued slowdown in economic growth and an easing of inflation 
analysts expected most major banks to follow chase manhattans 
lead in lowering their prime rate once they were certain the 
federal funds rate would remain near or below 9 percent thereby 
confirming the federal reserves policy to depress interest rates 
the rate was 81516 percent late friday 
reflecting banks continued dropping costs of funds the average 
yield on sixmonth certificates of deposit fell to a national 
average of 847 percent last week compared with 852 percent the 
previous week and the 88 percent range in late june according to 
the newsletter bank rate monitor 
in the bond market another indicator of general interest rate 
trends the yield on the 30year treasury bond finished at about 
798 percent friday its first close below 8 percent since april 8 
1987 
wilson said the banks second reason for lowering its prime was 
the weeks economic news shows definitely that the economy is 
slowing down 
a slowdown in the us economy tends to ease the risk of 
inflation thus allowing the fed to pursue a strategy of reducing 
interest rates 
wilson cited reports on friday by the commerce department that 
personal incomes rose a lackluster 03 percent in june as consumer 
spending which accounts for twothirds of us economic activity 
declined for a second straight month he also cited two months of 
negative growth in industrial production 
with this kind of interest rate and economic news across the 
board id expect the money center banks and big regional banks to 
do the same soon said banking analyst michael abrahms of 
bateman eichler hill richards inc in los angeles
