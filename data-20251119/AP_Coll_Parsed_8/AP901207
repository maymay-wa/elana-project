homicide among young black men and teenagers in 
america is rapidly worsening federal health officials said 
in 1988 2741 black males from 15 to 24 were slain in homicides 
in the united states cdc epidemiologist dr robert froehlke said 
thursday 
the killings based on preliminary figures would translate to a 
homicide rate of 1011 for every 100000 black males 1524 up 67 
percent from the 1984 rate of 606 while homicides decreased among 
young black men in the early 1980s the rate has skyrocketed since 
the atlantabased centers for disease control said in a report 
thursday 
rates for females and white males of that age have either 
stayed essentially the same or in fact decreased a little bit 
froehlke said the disparity between black males and other groups 
has widened even more 
in 1987 the latest year for complete statistics have been 
compiled the homicide rate for young black males was 846 some 
six times higher than the rate for all americans 1524 which was 
138 overall the nationwide homicide rate in 1987 was 85 
homicides accounted for 42 percent of the deaths of black males 
1524 in 1987 it was the leading cause of death for the group 
the homicide problem is getting worse faster for black 
teenagers the cdc said the 1988 homicide rate for black males 
1519 was 768 up 99 percent since 1984 the rate for black males 
2024 was 1272 up 53 percent from 1984 
firearm homicides accounted for virtually all the 198487 
explosion in killings of young black males more than 95 percent 
the cdc said 
and six areas with rates of greater than 100 california 
florida michigan missouri new york and the district of columbia 
accounted for more than half the deaths of young black males in 
1987 51 percent 
those six areas have 29 percent of the nations black male 
population 1524 the cdc said 
in its weekly report the cdc called for more research into ways 
to stop the killings 
research and evaluation efforts have not demonstrated 
effective programmatic approaches to prevent homicide it said

statistics dont lie but neither do they tell the whole truth 
behind the soaring numbers of homicides in some of americas 
largest cities lie the bodies and broken dreams of real people 
real families and real neighborhoods here is a sampling 
 
rayvon jamison was trying to learn how to walk when he died in 
his familys new york city apartment in july rayvon who was 9 
months old was one of four new york children who were caught in 
the line of gunfire in a weeks time 
rayvon was in a walker when he was struck in the shoulder by two 
of seven shots fired into the apartment police said at the time 
nine adults including his mother were home at the time 
three young men were arrested and charged with murder in the 
case police said they had been involved in an argument with 
rayvons uncle and some other neighborhood men 
mayor david dinkins issued an anguished plea for federal gun 
control after rayvons death 
our children are dying these young people these babies had 
the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but their 
rights have been blown away and for what he said 
 
on monday 10yearold willie lawrence became the years 60th 
homicide victim in bridgeport conn he was shot in the head in the 
innercity apartment building where he lived 
his cousin ramon pagan 18 said he believed he was the

kimberly rae harbour was 26 years old a crack user and 
sometimes prostitute for that reason some people in boston say 
police didnt make a big deal out of her death on halloween night 
it was however a horrifying death one that has since 
captured far more attention than harbour ever received in her life 
according to police harbour was chased into a park in the citys 
dorchester section by a group of teenagers who proceeded to rape 
her bludgeon her and stab her more than 100 times 
she also was robbed police said of 1 
eight youths have been charged in her death 
 
police called it a case of utterly senseless violence were 
it not for the victims last name bias the shooting on nov 20 in 
a shopping center outside washington dc probably would have 
been quickly forgotten 
police in marylands prince georges county said 20yearold 
james stanley bias iii also known as jay was shot in the parking 
lot of the prince georges plaza shopping center in hyattsville 
following an argument in a jewelry store a few minutes before 
jerry samuel tyler 24 of temple hills was charged with 
firstdegree murder in the case 
bias was pronounced dead of two gunshot wounds to the back at 
leland memorial hospital in riverdale the same hospital where his 
brother len bias was pronounced dead in june 1986 
len bias whose death shocked the sports world died of a 
cocaine induced heart attack just two days after his firstround 
selection by the boston celtics in the national basketball 
association draft

the attack on pearl harbor 49 years ago today 
was linked more closely than commonly believed to japans thirst 
for secure oil supplies according to a new book that draws 
haunting parallels to the persian gulf crisis 
in the prize the epic quest for oil money and power 
published this week author daniel yergin called oil the 
linchpin of japans strategy for asian conquest and the trigger 
for its stunning attack on pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 
the assault on the us pacific fleet killed 2335 american 
servicemen and 68 civilians 
yergins book which was seven years in the making cites the 
pacific campaign as one of many examples from the 20th century of 
oils crucial and painful role in global and regional conflict it 
draws parallels to the iraqi invasion of kuwait calling it a 
highstakes gamble by a militaristic ruler bent on capturing new 
oil wealth in order to widen his regional domination 
saddam hussein like japans leaders five decades earlier 
coveted oil and gave in to the inevitable and irresistible 
temptation to grasp for its rewards yergin writes 
historians for years have drawn a connection between oil and 
japans indochina campaigns yergin however says oil not only 
played a central role in the broader japanese war strategy but also 
was the driving force behind operation hawaii as the japanese 
military called the pearl harbor plan 
yergin an international oil specialist and president of the 
consulting firm cambridge energy research associates argues that 
the militaristic japanese leaders saw oil in particular japans 
lack of indigenous supplies as a vulnerability that could spoil 
their imperialistic ambitions in asia 
they went to war over oil yergin said in an interview 
so worried was adm isoroku yamamoto commanderinchief of 
japans combined fleets about insecure oil supplies to power his 
ships that he even sponsored experiments by a scientist who 
claimed he could change water to oil yergin writes japan also 
considered sinking large sums into a crash program to produce 
synthetic fuel from coal although this never yielded results 
yergin concludes that japans main focus in the asia campaigns 
was to secure access to the oil fields of borneo and the dutch east 
indies now indonesia at the time japan got 80 percent of its oil 
from the united states and it feared the consequences of a 
possible american cutoff of supplies 
in july 1941 president roosevelt did sever the oil lifeline a 
move that yergin says hardened the japanese leaderships resolve to 
strike at the us pacific fleet which tokyo believed was the only 
serious threat to its success in asia 
the operation against pearl harbor was meant to protect the 
flank to safeguard the japanese invasion of the indies and the 
rest of southeast asia by incapacitating the american fleet and 
thereafter to protect the sea lanes particularly the tanker 
routes from sumatra and borneo to the home islands yergin 
writes 
strangely considering the important role that oil played in 
japans decision to attack pearl harbor the japanese navy failed 
to understand the importance of the oil supplies on the hawaiian 
island of oahu yergin says they did not strike at the more than 4 
million barrels of oil stored on the island for the us ships 
if the japanese planes had knocked out the pacific fleets 
fuel reserves and the tanks in which they were stored at pearl 
harbor they would have immobilized every ship of the american 
pacific fleet and not just those they actually destroyed he

worried about how to send fragile gifts take 
some tips from curators of the corning museum of glass who just 
shipped more than 120 priceless treasures to washington without a 
chip or crack 
we do it very very carefully said museum official david 
whitehouse 
the secret is to pack an object so it is held gently but 
firmly into place with enough packing materials around it and a 
sturdy container to resist the bumps and knocks he said 
whitehouse supervised the installation of a new exhibition 
titled the art of glass masterpieces from the corning museum 
which will be on display at the national gallery of art from sunday 
through march 17 
the delicate objects that traveled from corning ny to 
washington span 35 centuries of the glassmakers art from a 
perfume bottle made by egyptian artisans in about 1400 bc to 
brilliantly colored glass filament sculptures fashioned by a dutch 
artist in 1988 
among the most famous pieces in the show are the disch 
kantharos a 4th century roman goblet contained in a clear glass 
cage and a rare hedwig beaker from the 12th century that was 
discovered in cologne germany 
from one of these carved glass tumblers only 14 of which are 
known to survive the patron saint of silesia supposedly drank 
water that turned into wine 
to pack a treasure like these whitehouse said the corning 
museum began with a stout cardboard box 
we would fill the box with two foam bricks cut to fit inside 
the box exactly when placed one on top of the other then we would 
carve out of the two bricks a nest as close to the shape of the 
object as we can make it and a tad bigger he said 
we would wrap the object in acidfree tissue paper and set it 
into the bottom half of the nest then wed fit the other brick on 
top so the object is gently but firmly trapped inside its own foam 
shock absorber 
then we put the box inside a custombuilt wooden crate about a 
halfinch thick the crate will contain usually eight cardboard 
boxes with little thin foam sheets to separate them then we screw 
the lid down on the crate 
what youve got is a stout crate of eight boxes instead of a 
carton of eggs he said 
for the 280mile trip to washington the boxed glass objects 
traveled in two customized commercial trucks built with an air 
suspension and long wheel base to minimize the shocks of hitting an 
occasional pothole 
the trucks were climatecontrolled to protect the glass from the 
damaging effects of sudden changes in temperature and humidity a 
halfdozen corning museum employees packed the objects traveled 
with the shipment and unpacked and mounted them at the national 
gallery 
several objects in the show are so fragile that they were 
carried personally to washington by the corning curators nestled 
safely under their car or plane seats 
whitehouse said one was an incredibly thin pitcher made in 
persia in 1000 ad that previously had been broken into a 
million pieces and painstakingly glued back together 
another secret is never to let these objects get out of your 
sight whitehouse said there is absolutely nothing you can do 
to stop a cowboy driving a forklift except to tell him to back 
off

to brazilian industrialists an 
acreperu road is the path to a brighter future to ecologists 
worried about the amazon it is the devils own highway 
such a road would fulfill a centuriesold vision of a land route 
across northern south america but it probably wont be built soon 
because the continent has a huge foreign debt and concern for the 
environment is growing 
mere mention of the acreperu road causes headlines in latin 
america mobilizes environmentalists in europe and the united 
states and starts up the diplomatic teletypes 
mario amato one of brazils most influential industrialists 
was the latest catalyst 
brazil must have an outlet to the pacific said amato who 
is acting president of the national confederation of industry and 
organized a seminar to promote the highway he said it would be a 
direct export route for brazilian forest products to the us west 
coast and japan bypassing the panama canal 
opposition to this road is mostly political demagoguery he 
said in an interview and environmentalists have a morbid 
aversion to progress real ecological degradation is that which 
destroys human dignity through misery and isolation 
amato said ecological problems can be worked out while the 
highway is being built 
his campaign has produced a flood of newspaper articles with 
maps and dotted lines showing how to link brazils farwestern 
amazon region as yet undestroyed with the pacific 
there are two possible routes for the road both starting at rio 
branco the capital of acre brazils westernmost state 
one would run northwest and hook up with the peruvian highway 
system about 700 miles away in pucallpa on the eastern slopes of 
the andes the other about 300 miles long would go southwest cut 
through part of northern bolivia and meet the peruvian road system 
at puerto maldonado a jungle outpost 
jungle tracks and muddy ruts already exist along sections of 
both routes but building the highway would involve massive 
clearing of forest and the uprooting of rubbertree tappers brazil 
nut harvesters and native indians 
on the peruvian side the road would run through country 
controlled by cocaine gangs and the maoist guerrilla group shining 
path both deadly to intruders 
the main opposition in brazil comes from president fernando 
collor de mello and his internationally known environment 
secretary jose lutzenberger 
im against the highway for ecological reasons lutzenberger 
said in an interview the president guaranteed it will not be 
built 
brazil plans to host a huge un world environment conference in 
1992 and has been working to change its image from destroyer of the 
amazon jungle to its protector 
perus director of roads hector rosales said in an interview 
in lima we are not in a condition to finance this road but if 
brazil or somebody else offered us money to build it we would 
probably accept 
for environmentalists the most convincing argument against a 
highway west of rio branco is the one called br364 that was opened 
east and south of there in the 1980s 
hundreds of thousands of homesteaders prospectors and ranchers 
followed the road into acres neighboring state rondonia and in a 
few short years chopped down or burned 20 percent of the virgin 
rain forest rondonia is the size of oregon 
when the interamerican development bank proposed to finance the 
paving of br364 such groups as the national wildlife federation 
sierra club and environmental defense fund mobilized a global 
campaign against it 
at one point proenvironment us senators threatened to block 
all us financing for the interamerican development bank because 
of br364 brazil agreed to impose strict protections for the 
jungle and indian tribes 
when the acreperu proposal emerged at the end of the decade 
president bush entered the picture at least in the view of the 
brazilian news media 
they were convinced bush personally opposed the highway and had 
pressured japan not to finance it brazilian environmentalists 
applauded the us leader and the prohighway faction accused him 
of meddling in brazilian affairs 
the president while aware of the controversy has never 
voiced a position on the road stephen hart deputy white house 
press secretary said in washington he said the administration 
would follow state department guidelines on the acreperu road 
a state department official who works on brazilian affairs said 
on condition of anonymity were not helping anybody whos 
building a highway in which there is no environmental plan 
japan also is cautious shintaro sasaki second in command at 
the japanese embassy in brasilia said his government was unaware 
of any plan to finance such a highway 
he agreed brazilian exports to the east now must travel through 
the panama canal or around cape horn but said that made sense for 
iron ore the main export to japan because the mines are in 
eastern brazil 
therefore he said japan has no interest in shortening 
trade routes from brazil by building a highway to the west coast of 
south america 
proponents are not giving up 
what were talking about is the need to physically link acre 
to the rest of the world said marco antonio mendes the states 
environment secretary

decades before the sound bite became 
the parlance of politics calvin coolidge doffed his silent cal 
image and stepped up to the mike delivering his annual message to 
congress to a spellbound nation 
historians on thursday remembered the anniversary of the 
presidents first broadcast hailed by critics of the day who said 
coolidges yankee twang cut admirably across the crackle of early 
radio 
apparently his highpitched nasal whine really penetrated the 
static said kelly buckley curator of the coolidge collection at 
the forbes library in northampton the western massachusetts town 
where coolidge got his political start 
the speech delivered dec 6 1923 on a hookup of seven radio 
stations sent neighbors flocking to the homes of those who owned 
new radio sets said buckley also a historian at the university of 
massachusetts 
out on the prairie picking up these little signals on crystal 
radio sets it really must have given people a sense of connection 
that they never had before he said 
the speech was a lengthy discourse on several topics including 
foreign affairs with coolidge taking a wishywashy stand on the 
league of nations and endorsing continued restricted immigration 
america must be kept american coolidge said in a broadcast 
heard by stations as far away as missouri and texas said michael 
kittross a professor at emerson college in boston 
coolidge was the master of the platitude buckley said 
what he said was comforting and full of cracker barrel wisdom

a new buildup of iraqi troops in and around 
kuwait is enabling iraq to extend its line of multilayered 
defenses well to the west of the occupied emirate the pentagon 
says 
bob hall a pentagon spokesman said thursday that iraq has 
moved an additional 30000 troops into kuwait and southern iraq 
raising the total to 480000 that is more than four times the 
number iraq used in its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
hall also announced that 10000 us reinforcements had arrived 
in the persian gulf area raising the total american deployment to 
more than 250000 
about 180000 additional us troops are scheduled to join 
operation desert shield over the next several weeks on thursday 
the army said it ordered to active duty 1521 national guard and 
reserve members for operation desert shield 
the army callup raised to 118834 the number of us reservists 
put on active duty in all services for desert shield since the 
operation began in august 
in announcing the further iraqi buildup at a news briefing hall 
said most of the extra iraqi troops were shifted from the iranian 
border their redeployment has enabled iraq to extend its line of 
defense further west from kuwait he said 
the apparent purpose of extending iraqi defensive fortifications 
to the west would be to block any flanking movement by american and 
allied ground forces in the event of an offensive campaign to 
dislodge iraq from kuwait 
us military officials have said they would look for ways of 
avoiding a frontal assault on the iraqi forces inside kuwait which 
are aligned in an elaborate and deep defensive position surrounded 
by land mines and antitank ditches 
the bush administration in arguing against waiting indefinitely 
for united nations economic sanctions to compel iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait has argued in recent days that delay would give iraq 
more time to strengthen its defenses in and around kuwait 
it is unclear however whether the extended defensive line iraq 
reportedly is building west of kuwait actually would make it harder 
for a us attack to succeed one army official speaking 
privately said the stretching of its defenses would make iraqs 
supply lines more vulnerable to air attack 
hall said the addition of 30000 iraqi troops to the area seemed 
to indicate that iraqi president saddam hussein did not intend to 
withdraw from kuwait even though iraq announced thursday that it 
was preparing the release of all foreign hostages 
a hostage release would not affect pentagon plans for desert 
shield troop deployments hall said 
he declined to provide more information about the latest iraqi 
reinforcements which apparently have been detected by us 
intelligence in recent days 
in testimony before the senate armed services committee gen 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said monday 
there were 450000 iraqi troops in and around kuwait along with 
3800 tanks hall said there now are 4000 tanks 
he also said the iraqis have 2500 armored personnel carriers 
and infantry fighting vehicles in the kuwait area of operations an 
increase of 300 from the total powell reported to the senate 
committee the number of iraqi artillery pieces was reported by 
hall to have increased by 200 to 2700 
the pentagon citing security wont provide figures on specific 
us weapons in the gulf area 
the latest us troops to arrive in the gulf apparently are the 
lead elements of a huge reinforcement effort under way at us 
bases in germany and the united states about 430000 american 
troops are expected to be in the gulf area by late january

americans in the nations biggest cities killed each other in 
record numbers this year a rise in carnage police blame on guns 
drugs and a declining reverence for human life 
not all cities had increased killings but the number of 
homicides in the 20 largest cities in 1990 has surpassed the 1989 
total by 3 percent and the year is not yet over police in those 
20 cities have recorded 7698 homicides so far this year 
new york city recorded its 2000th violent death of the year 
last weekend when seven people were killed in one night the city 
had long since surpassed its old record of 1905 homicides set 
just last year 
washington dcs mark of 434 homicides fell late last month 
making it likely that the nations capital which has the highest 
percapita homicide rate would remain the murder capital as well 
homicide records have been set in dallas phoenix san antonio 
memphis milwaukee boston and new orleans according to the latest 
statistics compiled by police in those cities new marks also were 
set in richmond va in providence ri bridgeport conn and 
oakland and fresno calif 
in most big cities police say young black men are causing and 
bearing the brunt of the increase in violence 
in 1990 young urbanites killed for drugs for clothes for 
pittances of cash for love for hate and just for the hell of it 
they killed friends relatives and innocent bystanders they turned 
poor neighborhoods into virtual prisons for lawabiding citizens 
they just dont care said lt joe hladky acting commander 
of the los angeles county sheriffs department homicide division 
its that disregard for the value of human life that makes you 
wonder what direction were going 
james a fox codirector of the national crime analysis program 
at northeastern university in boston has been tracking homicide 
statistics dating back to 1976 and believes the current upsurge in 
homicide can be traced to a baby boomerang the coming of age 
of the children of baby boomers 
the last big peak in homicides occurred in the early 1970s when 
baby boomers reached prime murder age late teens and early to 
mid20s now fox said their children are beginning to reach that 
age 
these young people fox said have drugs and weapons and a 
much more casual attitude about human life than their parents a 
generation ago 
this year will pale in comparison to years to come its going 
to get a lot worse he said its often said that americans 
have a love affair with violence but in reality its more like a 
marriage and if we dont watch out in the next few years it may 
be a marriage in which death does us part 
ask clifton waters a 36yearold milwaukee man a 21yearold 
man was shot to death while sitting in a car in front of waters 
home in october with 156 homicides so far this year milwaukee has 
far exceeded its previous high of 116 set in 1989 
when i was young you could play football in the street 
waters said if you bumped into someones car you said excuse 
me now if you touch someones car you get killed

the nations economic slide which has pushed 
the american unemployment rate up dramatically in recent months 
threatens to send the jobless rate to 6 percent or higher by the 
end of the year analysts say 
as the outlook becomes more dire the entire pipeline of 
jobs will slow said elliott platt an economist with donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
private analysts will get their first comprehensive look at the 
nations economic activity for november with todays release of the 
labor departments unemployment report 
in advance of the report many predicted the jobless rate shot 
up to 59 percent in november an increase of 02 percentage points 
from the october rate of 57 percent 
that would be the highest jobless rate since october 1987 when 
it was 6 percent 
analysts also expected the labor departments report to show 
that the nations industries lost between 45000 and 160000 jobs 
in november last year the nations economy was producing nearly 
200000 new jobs a month 
higher unemployment and widespread job losses in november would 
back up many analysts belief that the nation is in a recession 
even though government data backing that up or refuting it wont be 
out until january 
the recession deepened in november the lull continued that 
would be the basic message said robert dederick chief economist 
at the northern trust co of chicago 
if american businesses posted big job declines in november as 
predicted platt said it wont be a surprise because many 
companies have announced largescale layoffs in recent weeks 
its not just a matter of people not adding on workers its 
now a matter of laying them off platt said 
many analysts believe the jobless rate will be at least 6 
percent by the end of the year 
the trend is toward 6 percent if it isnt there by the end of 
the year it will be only because the labor force is growing more 
slowly than we think dederick said 
before july the jobless rate had held steady for months at 53 
percent or within a tenth of a percentage point of that level 
in july the jobless rate shot up from 52 percent to 55 
percent then rose again in august and september before holding 
steady at 57 percent in october 
the nations manufacturing sector which has been in a slump for 
months probably continued that slide in november analysts said 
but now the slump is also affecting the services sector as well 
they said 
the only industry that has been spared in recent months and 
continued to boom is health care which has been adding about 
50000 jobs a month

for professional petroleum traders prices for 
unleaded gasoline have tumbled to the level they stood at just 
before iraq invaded kuwait but for motorists prices at the pump 
are still near alltime highs 
if past pricing trends hold true ordinary consumers will find 
that the law of gravity doesnt necessarily apply in the energy 
business one consumer activist group said thursday that for the 
next few weeks at least customers of the friendly neighborhood 
filling station likely will get gouged 
when prices go up they raise prices immediately said edwin 
s rothschild of citizen action in washington when prices in 
these futures and spot markets go down it takes a long time for 
the savings to be passed on thats the way the companies take 
advantage of changing market conditions 
the oil industry which maintains that prices are set by supply 
and demand says pricing is not such a simple thing 
the american petroleum institute has acknowledged there are 
times when savings have not been passed along promptly to 
consumers but it has also pointed out trends in which crude oil 
prices were rising at the same time the pump price of gasoline was 
falling 
if the price of crude oil goes down and stays down then the 
price of gasoline will undoubtably follow api spokesman gus ensz 
said its difficult to analyze each and every situation because 
thousands of people are running service stations and the people 
who run those service stations make the ultimate decision 
the industry has asserted that all recent investigations into 
petroleum pricing cleared oil companies of gouging 
but rothschild said a comparison of recent prices shows that 
consumers are paying too much 
from the beginning of november to december theres been a 
20centagallon drop in the spot price of gasoline and yet 
theres been barely any decrease at all in the pump price of 
gasoline rothschild said my suspicion is if anything we 
should now be much more concerned about oil companies ripping 
consumers off 
on the new york mercantile exchange the leading market for 
petroleum contracts wholesale gasoline prices fell below 65 cents 
thursday to the approximate level they were at right before iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and caused a spike in the price of oil 
but the latest nationwide survey by the american automobile 
association found the average price of a gallon of selfserve 
regular unleaded to be 1387 thats 312 cents higher than the 
price on aug 1 and just 1 cent less than aaas highest recorded 
price of 1388 just before the easter holiday in 1981 the aaa 
said when the survey was released tuesday 
gasoline was up 21 cents for the week and aaa pointed out that 
it probably would have fallen a few cents for the week had it not 
been for the imposition of an additional 51cent federal tax 
which took effect saturday 
rothschild agreed that the tax had an impact and that otherwise 
pump prices could be coming down although he insisted any decrease 
will take too long

britains official war artist with sketchbook at 
the ready has been anxiously waiting for three months to start 
drawing the troops in the persian gulf 
the imperial war museum has commissioned him and is eager to get 
him there but a ministry of defense spokesman said wednesday 
there is no delay we havent got a war yet 
john keane still waiting in his north london studio says the 
commission is an extraordinary opportunity and ive been keyed up 
to be going 
the fact of my going doesnt depend on there being a war and i 
sincerely hope there wont be one said keane who has worked in 
zones of conflict in northern ireland and nicaragua 
the reason for my going is to portray the british troops 
committed to the area war would be an extra dimension 
the museum set aside almost 20000 in august for the keane 
commission a quarter before he goes and the balance on completion 
of his studio paintings from onthespot sketches and photographs 
i havent had a penny yet so i have been getting on with other 
work said keane 36 a respected artist who receives up to about 
30000 for an oil painting 
the imperial war museum in south london has 12000 works 
recording battles and the home front in both world wars as well as 
lesser campaigns like the 1982 conflict to regain the falkland 
islands 
we want john to go to the gulf now as when serious fighting 
takes place he cant do much he cant wander about with his 
sketchbook and camera if shells are falling said angela weight 
curator of the museums art collection 
the defense spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the ministry wont sanction an official war artist when there is 
no war at this time 
there has to be a conflict for him to be employed if 
something happens he could expect to go the spokesman said

rep albert bustamante reportedly under 
investigation by the fbi in texas says agents have threatened 
people with jail time if they refused to provide damaging 
information about him 
the san antonio texas light reported thursday that the fbi had 
confirmed it was investigating bustamante and his longtime friend 
eddie garcia as part of a probe into an indian bingo parlor deal 
but chief fbi spokesman thomas f jones refused to confirm or 
deny that the men were being investigated 
we are not going to comment on a pending investigation 
jones said 
the newspaper reported that a source said the fbi was 
investigating whether bustamante or garcia spent or received money 
illegally in pursuing a bingo parlor agreement with the kickapoo 
indians in eagle pass 
theyve been looking but they cant find anything its 
garbage said bustamante a democrat 
theyve tried to persuade people to say things against me 
even to the point of threatening them that theyll face jail 
time bustamante said 
bustamante said the investigation is the latest twist in a 
longrunning effort by the fbi to get some hispanic scalps 
particularly a hispanic politician 
bustamante said that he wrote a letter introducing garcia to 
leaders of the kickapoo tribe whose reservation is in his 
district garcia was lobbying them for a bingo contract 
an unidentified source told the newspaper that fbi agents are 
checking whether garcia offered any inducements to the tribe 
including bribes to cement the bingo deal 
garcia who told the san antonio expressnews earlier this week 
that the case is before a federal grand jury denies any 
impropriety 
garcia said the investigation was strictly political

saddam husseins decision to free all 
foreign hostages appears to be an iraqi gamble to avert war it 
also seems aimed at bolstering opposition in the united states to a 
persian gulf conflict 
in asking iraqs national assembly to free the hostages saddam 
cited positive changes in the persian gulf crisis including 
sentiment in the us congress for a nonmilitary solution 
he also said any measure that could delay war at the time was 
appropriate 
there are strong indications that saddam failed to get what he 
wanted from the hostages and that they had become a burden 
analysts said thursday 
now i think he is divesting himself of the burden and also 
taking away the biggest reason in the minds of public opinion for 
confronting him said philip robins an analyst with the royal 
institute of international studies in london 
from the beginning the hostages have been a public relations 
nightmare for saddam the world reacted to the detention of 
thousands of foreigners at least as harshly as it did to the 
invasion of kuwait itself 
the way they were labeled guests of iraq was ridiculed in 
the west so was saddams attempt to portray a kindly image by 
appearing on television ruffling the hair of a frightened looking 
child 
in responding to saddams announcement thursday president bush 
mentioned the worlds reaction 
no single hostage should have been taken in the first place 
and i hope saddam understands that his hostage policy has 
incurred the hostility of the whole world 
for weeks saddam had said he would release everyone in exchange 
for guarantees against an attack which he never received 
on nov 18 he said he would free all the hostages by march 25 
the only condition then was if nothing mars the atmosphere of 
peace 
but that step was followed by un security councils approval 
of the use of force to drive iraq out of kuwait if saddam does not 
withdraw by jan 15 
i think it increasingly becomes clear that the hostages have 
been a problem for him robins said they have not been able to 
deliver to him what he wanted which was immunity from attack or 
breaking up the international consensus against him 
i think having failed to achieve that the hostages have 
become a burden because they depict him as a tyrant in the west 
he said 
shahram chubin of the graduate institute for international 
studies in geneva said there seemed to be two main reasons for 
saddams latest move us domestic division on the use of force 
weakening the credibility of the jan 15 deadline and that the 
sanctions are working 
allowing more time for the sanctions to work was one of the 
strongest themes from experts testifying in hearings before the 
us senates armed services committee 
right after sanctions were imposed bush himself voiced 
confidence they would succeed in forcing saddam to withdraw from 
kuwait but his administration has shifted to the opposite view in 
recent weeks 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin powell 
defense secretary dick cheney and secretary of state james a baker 
iii have left no doubt that administration policy would not depend 
on ecomomic sanctions to force saddam to leave kuwait 
as we wait he will continue manipulating hostages attempting 
to break the coalition baker said 
on tuesday democrats in the house of representatives voted 
17737 for a nonbinding resolution that said bush should not order 
and attack without prior approval from congress 
i think the iraqis will try to use this to try to find an 
accommodation some sort of agreement with the united states 
robins said 
saddams releasing the hostages now puts the united states in 
the position of having to negotiate seriously when foreign minister 
tariq aziz goes to washington and baker goes to baghdad later this 
month analysts said 
the psychological pressure on saddam has been kept up both 
ways said don kerr a military analyst at the institute for 
strategic studies in london 
first came the us approach for talks followed up by gen 
powells indications and indications from mr baker that the united 
states was prepared to go to war and was prepared to make it 
sudden bloody and successful kerr said 
i think that this is probably a response by saddam in the same 
vein to throw off balance to obfuscate kerr said

following are excerpts of iraqi president 
saddam husseins letter to his national assembly on the release of 
foreign hostages as reported by the official iraqi news agency the 
excerpts were translated from the arabic by the associated press 
 
in the name of god the merciful the compassionate 
mr national assembly speaker members peace be upon you 
in difficult conditions the strength of the believers 
commitment is put to the test their action in the service of 
principles is also put to the test iraqis in general and you 
amongst them have proved that on very dark nights the spark of 
faith glows much brighter than on ordinary nights adherence to the 
supreme principles governing the relation between man and the 
creator and his duty toward him as well as the relation between 
the iraqis and other nations becomes stronger in the more 
difficult circumstances 
on the basis of these principles and what we desire that the 
influence of the believers expand and that the knowledge of 
mankind in general expand with the believers principles and the 
truth of their mission we deem it necessary that our national 
assembly convene to take a final and irrevocable stand toward a 
humanitarian issue which you and the rest of the world are aware 
of 
national assembly members the thing that worries the faithful 
mujahid the honorable struggler and the brave fighter most is 
when the trenches in the battle arena get mixed and when some 
people who do not want to fight and who are not among the 
evildoers get trapped in the space between the two trenches this 
worry becomes deep grief when that kind of people are harmed 
because of the level and type of the conflict 
some people with no confrontational or evil intentions were 
caught in the middle 
some of the foreigners who have been prevented from travel fall 
under that category in the battle between right led by iraqs 
great people and valiant armed forces and evil whose failing mass 
is led by bush the enemy of god 
as you and my brothers in the leadership know i recognize that 
despite what they had to put up with denying those people the 
freedom to travel has rendered a great service to the cause of 
peace and because god has taught us that forbidden things should 
never be resorted to except in very urgent cases and without any 
excesses we must not keep these emergency measures especially 
this measure any longer 
for instance our valiant iraqi forces had not completed their 
mobilization in kuwait to confront a potential military aggression 
any measure that could delay war at the time was appropriate 
although it may have not been correct from the humanitarian 
standpoint so that we use the opportunity to complete preparations 
for that possibility 
but now our forces with the blessing and care of the almighty 
are fully prepared to defend our values and principles against the 
traitors and infidels and also in defense of the great national 
regional and humanitarian gains 
gentlemen good people men and women of different nationalities 
and political trends have come to iraq dear brothers from jordan 
yemen palestine sudan and the arab maghreb have also consulted 
with us on this issue as on others we had suggested a different 
timing to coincide with christmas and new year the two holy 
occasions which are of special importance to christians all over 
the world especially in the west 
however the appeal by some arab brothers the decision of the 
democratic majority in the us senate and the european 
parliaments invitation to our foreign minister for dialogue all 
these have encouraged us to respond to these positive changes 
changes that will have a major impact on world public opinion in 
general and us public opinion in particular in restraining the 
evil ones who are seeking and pushing for war as the option they 
have chosen out of their evil tendencies and premeditated 
intentions to do harm 
in view of all this we have found that the reasons for which 
the foreigners were prevented from travel have diminished and have 
been replaced by something more powerful a change in the american 
public opinion which will impose restrictions on the decisions and 
intentions of the evil ones led by bush the enemy of god 
therefore i urge you to take a just decision to end the travel 
ban imposed on foreigners and to restore to all of them the freedom 
to travel apologizing to those who may have been harmed and 
seeking forgiveness from god the almighty 
brothers i ask you and through you i ask the iraqi people to 
maintain your alertness and vigil iraqi armed forces should 
maintain the highest degree of alert and vigilance because the 
forces of aggression remain on our sacred soil in saudi arabia 
fanning the flames of fire 
bushs call for dialogue is still concealing war intentions and 
we must be aware not to fall into such traps 
god is great cursed be the infidels and traitors who gave the 
oppressors and infidels the opportunity to invade the holy 
land

galina is tired of russian men who expect her to 
do all the cooking and shopping plus work a fulltime job she has 
an idea that with an american man things might be a bit more 
equal 
so she sent three photographs and an application to nakhodka or 
godsend the first mailorder bride service matching soviet 
women with north american men 
of course if i met a very sweet american man i would be 
willing to cook and clean for him too galina 36 explained in 
an interview but at least i would be living in america 
the lure of love in a land of prosperity has hooked many soviet 
women this year more than 1500 have paid 50 rubles about 880 
apiece to join godsend since it was founded eight months ago 
the company is part of a new soviet bride industry that includes 
an italian marriage service an international video introduction 
firm and halfadozen magazines packed with personal ads 
behind the industry are two recent phenomena president mikhail 
s gorbachevs political reforms which have made it easier to 
meet marry and move abroad with foreigners and the worsening 
soviet economy which has cut into the quality of many womens 
lives and set them to dreaming about life in the west 
soviet women have a lot more respect for american men than for 
soviet men said sergei kurochkin 39 a former computer software 
designer who founded godsend last april 
they say soviet men are lazy unfaithful and rude they want 
someone who will hold doors open for them 
again and again those sentiments are reflected in the seductive 
short letters that women who join godsend write about themselves 
im kind and sensitive and i want to marry a gentleman 
wrote maria i want to look after him 
for me the ideal husband is an american man wrote galya 
28 i would like someone 3035 years old intelligent who 
wants to start a family on the basis of mutual respect tenderness 
and love 
many letters also brim with frustration over the competing 
demands of working fulltime shopping and keeping a home 
kurochkin said the choice of most soviet women is clear they 
love their homes they want to be in their kitchens 
for 25 an american man can receive a packet of a dozen such 
letters and photographs from a los angelesbased agency called 
americanrussian matchmaking 
after corresponding by mail the wouldbe american groom can 
arrange through godsend to come to the soviet union for 10 days to 
meet his prospective mate a trip that costs between 1500 and 
4000 
if he ends up marrying one of the women the price rises even 
more by contract hes obligated to pay the matchmakers 3000 
still there seems to be plenty of interest after the us army 
magazine stars and stripes published a picture of some of the 
women it got phone calls from us servicemen in saudi arabia 
asking for the matchmaking firms address 
kurochkin said hes still working out the bugs in his system 
originally he offered to link american women with soviet men but 
found little demand and dropped the service some soviet men shake 
their heads at their american counterparts who change diapers and 
share household chores 
recently kurochkin began requiring soviet women to say whether 
they smoke because beansproutandwholewheat types from 
california were appalled to be matched with chainsmokers 
so far no marriages have resulted from godsends efforts 
kurochkin said the first may be in late january or early february 
when a soviet woman plans to fly to the united states to join an 
american man she met through the agency in november

the governments top auditor says a treasury 
department idea for increasing the dwindling insuranc fund for 
bank deposits looks like an accounting gimmick 
charles a bowsher head of the general accounting office told 
the house banking committee on thursday that requiring banks to 
purchase preferred stock from the federal deposit insurance corp 
gives us great concern 
bowshers statement came in response to a question from rep 
henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the committee who called 
the proposal highly unusual 
does this pass the auditors sniff test gonzalez asked 
it worries us bowsher replied explaining that the plan 
allows both the government fund and banks to count the same money 
as an asset 
currently banks support the fund by paying deposit insurance 
premiums which are treated as an expense and deducted from bank 
earnings 
under the preferred stock proposal the insurance fund would get 
the banks money 14 billion to 28 billion over five years and 
the banks would get a dividendearning preferred stock certificate 
that would count as an asset rather than as an expense 
we start to fall into the trap of what i call accounting 
gimmicks bowsher said 
the problem would arise if the bank fund sinks deeper into 
trouble if accountants doubt the fdic stock could be redeemed at 
face value they would probably force banks to write it down and 
take a loss 
in a speech last week fdic chairman l william seidman said the 
preferred stock plan was among three options being studied to shore 
up the dwindling bank insurance fund by year end the fund is 
expected to have only about 10 billion protecting insured deposits 
of nearly 2 trillion 
one option would be another increase in deposit insurance 
premiums on top of the more than 60 percent increase taking effect 
jan 1 another is a onetime assessment on banks 
both would burden the industry at a time of declining profits 
however critics of the preferred stock plan say it would only 
postpone recognition of the burden 
bowsher said he was considering telling treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady that the gao as auditor of the fdic would 
look very closely at the preferred stock proposal 
brady has acknowledged the bank insurance fund may need a cash 
infusion and has pledged that the money will come from the 
industry not taxpayers

domestic use of rice including large 
quantities to make beer is rising enough to take up some of the 
slack caused by a drop in exports the agriculture department says 
total us production at an estimated 1544 million 
hundredweight is about the same as last year although yields 
dropped sharply in arkansas and some other areas 
all told the us rice stockpile by the end of the 199091 
marketing year next summer may be about 237 million hundredweight 
the smallest in a decade and only a fraction of the carryovers up 
to 776 million in 1986 in some previous years 
recent supplyanddemand figures show domestic use and 
residual will be around 888 million hundredweight in 199091 
up from 824 million last season residual includes unreported 
uses processing losses and statistical errors 
exports are projected at 73 million hundredweight compared with 
768 million in 198990 and 859 million in 198889 
the december issue of agricultural outlook magazine said world 
rice production this year is expected to be at a record level and 
that is making export competition tougher 
iraq the fourth largest importer in 1989 accounted for 4 
percent of global imports the report said further iraq was 
the largest market for us rice last year taking about 13 percent 
of us exports 
the analysis said the united nations embargo is expected to 
reduce iraqs total rice imports by about 44 percent in 1991 
but the embargo had a smaller impact on 1990 imports because 
most of the rice had already been delivered before the embargo was 
imposed the report added 
rice is grown mostly in six states arkansas california 
louisiana mississippi missouri and texas arkansas with 
production estimated at 60 million hundredweight accounts for 
nearly 40 percent of this years crop 
martha r evans of usdas economics management staff said rice 
is grown on about 12000 farms in the united states and is the 
most expensive of the major commodities to produce on a peracre 
basis it is completely dependent on irrigation and its production 
is highly mechanized 
evans writing in farmline magazine said rice is a major food 
for more than half the worlds people 
rice in the united states was first produced in appalachia and 
the southeast after the civil war however louisiana and texas 
become more competitive because they had plenty of level fertile 
cheap land and not as many trees 
expansion continued into arkansas and eventually into 
california mississippi and missouri evans said recently 
rice production has increased in florida 
she noted the increase in rice yields from an average of 1144 
pounds per acre in 1895 to 3061 pounds in 1955 this years 
harvest is estimated at 5499 pounds per acre 
 
washington ap once the goal of breeding new plants was to 
increase their yields of food and fiber needed for survival of the 
human species an agriculture department report shows how times 
have changed 
henry l shands of the departments agricultural research 
service said in the report thursday that about a hundred times a 
year agency researchers release new plant varieties that have 
special traits to let them thrive even if there are viruses 
bacteria fungi insects bad weather and poor soils 
shands is the agencys national program leader for research on 
germplasm the genetic material in seeds cuttings and live 
plants 
even during the 1960s he said the primary aim of more than 
half the new plant strains released by the agency was to boost 
yields not today 
the research strives to customize a crop to withstand 
diseases pests and environmental stresses such as drought while 
preserving traits for high yield shands said 
in a fiveyear period 1984 to 1989 the usda research agency 
made 599 germplasm releases that had improved resistance to some 
pest or disease 
these releases consisted of 147 actual plant varieties and 452 
germplasm lines strains of plants with useful traits that 
breeders can transfer into existing varieties he said 
approximately 80 percent of the releases over the five years had 
improved disease resistance 30 percent had improved insect 
resistance and about 10 percent had improved resistance to 
nematodes tiny worms in soil 
some releases contained more than one kind of resistance which 
shands said pushed the total to mcent 
the current us germplasm collections include nearly 400000 
plant introductions cultivars and germplasm releases he said the 
core than 100 perollections are a source of a steady supply of new crop 
varieties 
in the united states alone farmers grow more than 200 
varieties of wheat 85 varieties of cotton 200 varieties of 
soybeans and many kinds of fruit vegetables and ornamental 
crops shands said disease and pest resistance must be bred 
into each of these varieties which often thrive only in specific 
growing areas 
 
washington ap the agriculture department says farmers who 
participated in the 1990 wheat barley and oats program will 
receive more than 17 billion in cash payments 
keith bjerke executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said thursday that the subsidies would be 
paid by county ap as president bush nears the end of his 
south american tour he is encouraged by the promised release of 
hostages from iraq and kuwait but says this is no time to relax 
military pressure on saddam hussein 
after concluding a 24hour visit to chile bush was heading 
today for venezuela a longtime us friend and major oil producer 
and the last stop on his fivenation swing to promote democracy and 
free trade 
bush has praised venezuela for increasing oil production after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait the venezuelan move has helped to ease 
inflation in world oil prices 
the price of oil has fluctuated wildly since august rising when 
persian gulf tensions increased and receding when peace prospects 
seemed to improve venezuelan president carlos andres peres has 
called for talks among consumers and producers to see if a way can 
be found to stabilize prices 
officials said venezuela advocates creation of a hemispheric oil 
reserve for emergencies but that the united states has so far 
shown little interest in the idea 
in chile there was a spate of bombings and antibush 
demonstrations thursday but the overall reception seemed friendly 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the welcome 
terrific 
bush hailed chiles return to the democratic fold in march and 
praised the government for a reform policy that has led to a surge 
in economic growth 
once again the gulf crisis intruded on bushs activities 
thursday he was flying to chile from buenos aires argentina when 
word came of the prospective release of about 900 american 
hostages fitzwater called the iraqi announcement a hopeful 
sign 
release of the hostages has been a key demand of the united 
states and the global coalition against iraq along with the 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait the restoration of the 
exiled emir and a guarantee of security in the gulf 
but at a news conference thursday bush said saddams show of 
flexibility will not affect his gulf policy bush said saddam 
must leave kuwait without reservation without condition 
weve got to continue to keep the pressure on said bush 
who has authorized the deployment of more than 400000 americans to 
the gulf 
the president promised there would not be any secret deal with 
saddam to end the gulf crisis there are no secret negotiations 
direct or indirect with iraq over this question he said none 
and there will be none 
bushs chilean visit was the first by an american president in 
30 years the welcome was not uniformly friendly 
before bush arrived the guerrillas exploded a halfdozen bombs 
overnight at sites with us ties including four mormon chapels a 
new mcdonalds restaurant and a downtown park outside a hotel where 
some officials in bushs advance party were staying 
the presidents limousine was hit by an egg thrown from the 
crowd as his motorcade passed through santiago streets police 
reported no injuries 
police used tear gas and water cannon to scatter scores of 
university students who staged an antibush protest at a campus in 
the southern section of the city the students threw rocks at 
police and blocked traffic for two hours in front of the campus 
they burned at least two us flags and waved several cuban flags 
later shortly before bushs arrival for a dinner at the 
presidential palace police dispersed demonstrators who were 
shouting antiamerican slogans 
bush also visited brazil and uruguay and he returns to 
washington saturday

iran says it has arrested 7000 drug 
addicts and smugglers only days after amnesty international 
condemned such arrests and said iran had killed more than 1100 
alleged drug traffickers in 1989 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted the director of the 
antidrugs squads of the islamic revolutionary committees as saying 
thursday that 6247 addicts and 651 drug smugglers were arrested 
in the crackdown 
the official identified only as yabu said 350 pounds of drugs 
were confiscated in raids over the past month 
he warned that a massive followup operation would be launched 
today to wipe out centers where addicts and smugglers 
congregate 
yabu said 715 checkpoints were to be set up to catch traffickers 
today 
iranians generally mock such operations which are announced in 
advance 
if i were a drug smuggler do you think i would be stupid 
enough to transport my goods on a day when everybody is out looking 
for me said an iranian businessman in tehran last week 
iran has executed more than 1500 alleged drug smugglers and 
jailed over 70000 socalled addicts since december 1988 according 
to official figures 
possession of even small quantities of drugs with intent to 
sell carries a mandatory death sentence under irans laws 
iranian opposition groups say the drugrelated killings and 
arrests mask a crackdown on political opponents 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization said in report tuesday that iran executed 5000 
political opponents in the past three years 
the amnesty report coincided with a resolution passed by the 
united nations third committee condemning human rights violations 
in iran

a new contraceptive is expected to be 
available in the united states beginning in february giving women 
their first major new option in decades the manufacturer says 
norplant consists of six match sticksize silicone rubber 
capsules that are implanted in a minor surgical procedure under the 
skin of a womans upper arm for five years the capsules release a 
hormone to prevent pregnancy but they can be removed and 
fertility restored at any time 
the food and drug administration is expected to approve the 
contraceptive within days 
it offers them a new choice which is longlasting and 
convenient uses the lowest dose of hormone thats used in any 
hormonebased method and it doesnt contain estrogen said c 
wayne bardin vice president and director of medical research for 
the new yorkbased population council 
the council began researching the method in 1966 wyethayerst 
laboratories of philadelphia will market the contraceptive 
norplant has been approved in 16 countries half a million 
people in those countries have used norplant according to the 
councils data 
its the most effective reversible method of contraception 
with a failure rate of less than 1 percent said dr samuel a 
pasquale a principal investigator in the norplant studies and an 
associate dean at robert wood johnson medical school in new 
brunswick nj 
norplant is one of the most significant advances in 
contraception weve had in the last 30 years since the birth 
control pill and intrauterine device became available pasquale 
said 
the major side effect is menstrual irregularities including 
spotting between periods and prolonged periods this causes about 
15 percent of women with the implant to have it removed bardin 
said 
wyethayerst officials were reluctant to talk about norplant on 
thursday without fda approval of their product yet 
company spokeswoman audrey ashby said that assuming approval 
comes shortly the company expects norplant to be available 
commercially in february wyethayerst plans to train physicians 
how to implant the capsules but there will be some lag time 
she said obviously not every physician will be trained to do 
it by the time it is available 
ashby said the price of norplant was being evaluated but she 
said it will be priced significantly below oral contraceptives 
over five years birth control pills cost around 15 to 20 per 
month 
bardin said he had been told the price would be about 200 to 
300 for norplant which does not include the price of having the 
implant 
the price worries lisa kaeser a policy analyst for the alan 
guttmacher institute a research and education group that deals 
with reproductive health issues 
im not sure its going to be available for lowincome 
women she said that will depend largely on wyethayersts price 
of the contraceptive to family planning clinics 
bardin said norplant fits the needs of many women but is 
particularly wellsuited to those who have completed their family 
size but dont want to become sterilized and for women who want to 
delay pregnancy for a fixed time 
it also is a good choice for women who dont want to take 
estrogen which is in most birth control pills and is a risk for 
women with a family history of breast cancer he said 
the capsules are implanted in a minor surgical procedure with 
local anesthesia generally they are not noticeable when they are 
removed the contraceptive effects are reversed and the woman is as 
fertile as she was before the implant 
its not clear yet how norplant will be accepted by american 
women the contraceptive is popular in the countries where it has 
been approved bardin said 
its a matter of public education of people recognizing that 
they can have it taken out when they wish kaeser said

airline pilots told investigators they had 
become confused while taxiing in the same runway area where two 
northwest airlines jets collided in heavy fog this week killing 
eight people 
the unidentified pilots not involved in the fatal collision 
volunteered the information in interviews with the national 
transportation safety board team looking into mondays crash head 
investigator john lauber said thursday 
previous confusion among pilots at detroit metropolitan airport 
was reported and not necessarily under low visibility 
conditions lauber said at a news conference held before most of 
the team left detroit 
investigators used a dc9 jet thursday to reconstruct the errant 
path taken by a northwest dc9 through heavy fog onto runway 3c 
where a northwest boeing 727 was thundering toward takeoff for 
memphis tenn 
lauber said reconstructing the events leading up to the crash 
helped investigators document what the cockpit crew may have seen 
including all taxiway markings runway markings the lights the 
signs 
eight people were killed and 20 were injured when the 
pittsburghbound dc9 carrying 39 passengers and four crew 
members apparently made two wrong turns and ended up in the path 
of the other jet 
the 145 passengers and eight crew aboard the boeing 727 jet 
escaped injury 
investigators have said poor visibility inadequate runway 
lighting and pilot and controltower error could have contributed 
to the crash 
we wouldnt at this stage rule out anything lauber said 
about 70 ntsb workers have been conducting interviews and 
investigations remaining investigators hoped to finish field work 
over the weekend 
weve gotten to the point where the factual part of this is 
starting to wind down now its all analyzing the data agency 
spokesman brent bahler said 
a final report could take as long as a year to complete 
on wednesday milio rinna 60 of allen park a passenger on the 
dc9 filed a lawsuit against northwest in wayne county circuit 
court the first suit filed against the airline after mondays 
crash 
rinna a health and safety official with the united steelworkers 
union suffered burns and other injuries after using his bare hands 
to extinguish flames on another passenger said his lawyer william 
l martens of southfield 
martens and northwest spokesman bob gibbons said rinnas suit 
probably would be the first of many 
it seems inconceivable to me given the number who were 
injured and the number of deaths that there will not be other 
lawsuits martens said 
gibbons agreed but declined further comment on legal action 
five passengers remained hospitalized today listed in 
conditions ranging from good to serious

american university trustees rescinded their 
1 million buyout offer to former president richard berendzen who 
pleaded guilty to making obscene telephone calls and will allow 
him to return to campus as a faculty member 
board chairman edward carr said all 27 trustees present at a 
special meeting thursday agreed to withdraw the initial settlement 
offer he said the board supports the alternative agreement 
spearheaded by interim president milton greenberg in consultation 
with faculty committees and agreed to by berendzen 
i hope todays events will allow us to put the turmoil of the 
past month behind us said carr 
carr met with reporters after the twohour trustees meeting 
during which student faculty and staff groups voiced strong 
opposition to the initial settlement the schools alumni 
association called for berendzen to sever all ties with the 
university 
berendzen 51 resigned as president abruptly last april citing 
fatigue the next month he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor 
charges of making obscene telephone calls from his university 
office to a woman living in a virginia suburb of washington 
he was sentenced to two 30day jail terms which were suspended 
provided he stays out of trouble for one year and continues 
psychological treatment 
although carr declined to discuss specifics the initial offer 
reportedly would have reached 1 million and included more than 
600000 in appreciation for berendzens contributions in raising 
the universitys image and prestige 
under the alternative agreement berendzen will be on 
administrative leave with pay at his faculty salary for the 
199091 academic year and the fall 1991 semester the salary will 
be in the range of 70000 officials said 
berendzen who throughout the ordeal had continued to draw his 
annual salary of about 140000 since resigning as president in 
april will return in the spring of 1992 as a full professor of 
physics 
in rescinding the offer carr said the action does not affect 
severance payments to berendzen provided for in his presidential

some of manuel noriegas taped prison conversations 
were in code including passages in which the deposed panamanian 
dictator apparently discussed frozen funds court transcripts show 
many of the conversations included in transcripts released by a 
federal judge thursday dealt with family affairs but some 
apparently involved money transfers and others showed noriega 
followed panamanian politics after he was ousted during a us 
invasion in december 1989 among the apparently coded calls was one 
by noriega to the cuban embassy in panama 
the government tapes some of which were broadcast by cnn last 
month triggered a battle pitting freedom of the press against 
noriegas right to a fair trial 
after first ordering cnn to halt the broadcasts us district 
judge william hoeveler ruled last week that the tapes were harmless 
to noriegas defense and allowed the network to resume the 
broadcasts 
this week the judge agreed to a request by media organizations 
to release court transcripts of the tapes over the objections of 
cnn the network dropped its objections wednesday 
in one transcript norma amado mother of noriegas mistress 
talked in apparent code with him about why the man had not 
arrived the conversation appeared to be about frozen funds 
amado said the man would go elsewhere because its not frozen 
there since we are all frozen here and over there it wouldnt 
be a problem 
she also discussed the need for a good towel and the 
important thing is it shouldnt be a hand towel 
cnn has said that conversation also included coded discussions 
about the transfer of 4 million 
in a call to the cuban embassy noriega said he would send a 
facsimile transmission so you can grab it and pass it on to the 
grandfather 
another transcript had noriega urging an unidentified man to 
encourage opposition to the new panamanian government 
we must explain that one must unite that there are people 
with ambition that are now going to take over the party he said 
the transcripts included five tapes most containing several 
conversations 
in one previously telecast conversation noriega speculated 
about two potential government witnesses with his lawyers 
secretary who was translating for a defense investigator that 
conversation triggered the original objection by noriegas 
attorneys who said broadcastingit would violate lawyerclient 
privilege and hurt his chances of getting a fair trial 
the transcripts showed that noriega was commenting on an article 
in el nuevo herald the spanishlanguage edition of the miami 
herald about the arrest of the two men alfredo sanchez and felipe 
camargo 
the news organizations that went to court for the transcripts 
were the miami herald the associated press postnewsweek station 
wplgtv of miami and gannett co inc and usa today which gannett 
owns they argued that the public has a right to examine the 
content of tapes that ignite a freespeech controversy 
noriegas defense team claims the panamanian government gave the 
tapes to cnn after receiving them from the us government taping 
prisoners telephone callsis legal 
noriega is awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges the he 
took 46 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing 
through panama from colombia to the united states

in a nearby classrom some students were 
singing christmas carols while federica tacconi took notes about 
some homework at the end of a german lesson 
looking through the window i suddenly saw it coming it was 
coming slowly silently as if it was pushed by the wind its wings 
tilting i was paralyzed by dread i heard someone screaming 
then a rumble and the wall collapsed she recalled in tears 
federica 16 was one of the four italian students of a class of 
16 who survived the crash of a flaming military jet into a 
classroom in a suburban high school thursday 
pulled free from the wreckage of a wing she suffered a crushed 
pelvis and burns but was not in danger of life doctors at bologna 
maggiore hospital said 
twelve of her classmates were killed instantly when the 
pilotless jet plowed into a high school at casalecchio three miles 
outside bologna the engine had caught fire forcing the pilot to 
bail out 
at the time of the crash 285 students 28 teachers and four 
monitors were at the gaetano salvemini vocational high school 
authorities said 
the teacher who had just completed a german lesson was 
hospitalized in nearby parma with critical burn injuries 
in nearby classrooms panic spread because of the flames and 
heavy smoke but many did not immediately realize what had happened 
its an earthquake some of my friends shouted i thought of a 
bomb or the explosion of a heating boiler i could not believe it 
had been a jet said federico bonanni 18 who reached the ground 
safely from a third floor classroom on ladders quickly brought by 
firefighters 
many survivors panicked and jumped from the windows before 
arrival of firemen a few minutes after the accident 
in total those injured were 87 including a firefighter and the 
jet pilot who bailed out shortly before the crash 
the prosecutors office and a military commission are 
investigating the crash the cause of the engine fire was not 
immediately known 
gen carlo brandini said the plane was on a mission to test the 
effectiveness of an antiaircraft radar system and had taken off 
from villafranca military airport near verona 55 miles north of 
bologna 
he said the mb326 aermacchi was flying at about 280 mph when 
trouble developed in its single engine which then burst into 
flames 
italian air force officers said the pilot 2nd lt bruno 
viviani stuck to the emergency procedure as he tried to land his 
stricken craft into the fields after unloading most of the fuel 
but the fire forced viviani to bail out paramilitary officers 
reported 
several eyewitnesses saw the military jet painted in bright 
orange coming down slowly in flames and hit the threestory school 
after grazing a fivefloor condominium complex 
officers reported that the pilot was not immediately told of the 
high death toll claimed by the crash 
federica also did not know that 12 of her classmates were 
killed 
i hope carmen and laura managed to jump from the window or 
flee through the corridor she said 
carmen schrinzi and laura corazza both 16 were listed among 
the known victims

the courtroom stink over elizabeth taylors 
passion perfume evaporated when the legendary actress reached an 
agreement with her former boyfriend 
miss taylor retains control of the passion perfume line which 
has earned 70 million under terms of the agreement announced 
thursday 
her exboyfriend henry wynberg will drop a lawsuit against the 
actress in which he claimed he developed the fragrance and miss 
taylor will drop a countersuit against wynberg 
it means im vindicated and it proves the perfume passion is 
something i worked a year and a half for miss taylor said after 
superior court judge coleman swart announced the settlement 
both sides will pay their own legal fees and no money will 
change hands said miss taylors attorney neil papiano 
swart said the settlement was made with prejudice meaning 
neither wynberg or miss taylor can raise the issue again 
wynberg and his attorney quentin kopp refused to confirm that 
wynberg wont get any money in his lawsuit he asked for nearly 
threequarters of passions profits 
the settlement was reached during jury selection for a trial 
that had promised to be embarrassing to both sides 
attorneys for wynberg a former used car salesman who was miss 
taylors boyfriend between her two marriages to actor richard 
burton in the 1970s said they would bring up the academy 
awardwinning actress highly publicized bouts with alcohol and 
obesity 
miss taylors attorneys said they would bring up wynbergs 
guilty pleas to charges of statutory rape providing underage girls 
with drugs in return for sex and taking pornographic photos of 
young girls 
miss taylor acknowledged she was glad to avoid the trial 
its not something i was looking forward to but i was willing 
to fight as long as i had to she said 
jury selection was highlighted thursday by a prospective jurors 
statement that he had seen most of miss taylors silent films 
which brought laughter from the actress and others in the packed 
courtroom 
miss taylor 58 wasnt born until after the silent movie era 
ended her more than 50 films include national velvet whos 
afriad of virginia woolf cat on a hot tin roof and 
butterfield 8 for which she won an academy award as best 
actress 
wynberg claimed he was the creator of passion and said miss 
taylor breached a contract with him to develop the popular 
fragrance the pair signed an agreement in burtons presence in 
1975 for wynberg to market cosmetics under miss taylors name 
but the actress said wynberg breached the contract by not 
following through and developing a product

the us government gained a key ally in its 
prosecution of manuel noriega when a former aide admitted 
delivering drug money to the deposed panamanian dictator and agreed 
to testify against his former boss 
the admission is significant us attorneys office 
spokeswoman diane cossin said thursday the defense attorney has 
asserted that his client is very knowledgeable 
luis del cid 47 a lieutenant colonel under noriega admitted 
thursday that he was a liaison courier and emissary for manuel 
antonio noriega in his transactions with drug traffickers 
he had faced a possible 70year prison term if convicted on four 
racketeering counts in exchange for the guilty plea to one count 
the government dropped the other three and recommended a 10year 
sentence 
prosecutors said they would consider reducing that to three 
years if del cid cooperates fully that could mean he would leave 
prison by early 1992 defense attorney sam burstyn said 
the plea bargain boosted the governments drug case against 
noriega after months of disputes over frozen bank accounts 
attorneys fees and leaked tapes of noriegas prison phone calls 
prosecutors said del cid gave noriega 100000 in cash from drug 
pilot and star prosecution witness floyd carlton caceres in 
november 1982 del cid received an envelope with 150000 cash from 
carlton in 1983 and also picked up a suitcase stuffed with cash 
both of which were delivered to noriega 
yes i transported the money but well i am repentant at 
having done so del cid told us district judge william 
hoeveler what i was doing was following orders of a superior 
officer 
plea negotiations had stalled in march because del cid feared he 
would be sent back to panama for criminal prosecution after 
pleading guilty in the united states 
burstyn said the agreement eliminated that problem he will 
never be sent anywhere that he does not want to go 
del cid will testify against noriega his lawyer said 
he could back up testimony by carlton who served 4 years in 
prison and is now under federal protection and of panamanian 
businessman enrique kiki pretelt who has pleaded guilty in a 
parallel tampa marijuana case against noriega 
noriega is accused of taking 46 million in bribes to ship 
cocaine through panama

redwing blackbirds form bonded pairs withing a 
defended territory but neither partner appears to care much about 
remaining faithful a researcher says 
genetic tests show that up to a third of all redwing blackbird 
chicks are fathered by lusty males that cuckold their neighbors 
its clear that there is mating outside of the socially bonded 
pairs said h lisle gibbs a biologist at queens university in 
ontario canada but just which bird is untrue the male or the 
female is still not clear he said thursday 
whatever the case gibbs said genetic tests run on blood 
samples taken from 36 redwing blackbird families in a canadian 
marsh showed that about a third of all chicks were fathered by 
males that lived in neighboring territories 
in effect a male often is defending a nest that contains 
another birds offspring 
a report on the study was to be published friday in the journal 
science 
gibbs said earlier studies of blackbirds tried to determine 
reproductive success by counting the number of chicks in nests 
within a territory defended by a specific male 
our work shows that is clearly an inaccurate measure of 
success because so many of the chicks are actually fathered by 
males from other territories he said 
redwing blackbirds spend virtually all spring and summer trying 
to assure their personal success at reproduction 
males gibbs said stake out a territory in march or april and 
spend the rest of the season defending it 
to get any mating success a male redwing has to hold a piece 
of turf he said they will spend days fighting defending 
their territory there is a long period of conflict even before the 
females show up 
when the females do arrive the males put on quite a show 
trying to attract the ladies gibbs said 
a male is successful when one or more females chooses to build a 
nest in his territory the pair mate and except for a little home 
defense the males job is over 
over the course of a season a successful male may lure up to 
five females to nest in his territory he will defend each nest but 
wont help raise any of the chicks 
its not like other monogamous species where both act to feed 
the young gibbs said thats the difference in this mating 
system 
biologists believe males in many species are driven to have as 
many offspring as possible and often to defend their mates from 
reproductive success of other males 
but among the redwing blackbird gibbs said theres a 
definite conflict between the sexes because such a high 
percentage of the young are fathered by outside males 
the key question is whether females are going out and seeking 
other males or are males going out and coercing females he 
said it could be a combination of both but whos running the 
show the males or the females 
though the answer must await more research gibbs noted if i 
had to guess i would say its the females 
gibbs team of researchers in the study included peter t boag 
lisa m tabak and bradley n white all of queens university and 
pj weatherhead and drew j hoysak of carleton university in 
ottawa

nearly 50 years after japanese planes bombed pearl 
harbor some japanese are trying to persuade their government to 
apologize for the attack 
atsuyuki sassa a former government official said thursday he 
hoped prime minister toshiki kaifu would make a statement today 
the 49th anniversary of the attack that drew the united states into 
world war ii 
with that possibility dimming i am trying my best to get him 
to make a comment on jan 1 we must do something before 
president bushs visit in the spring said sassa who has 
worked in the prime ministers office 
kenichi takemura a social commentator called for a mutual 
forgiveness week for the two countries in an interview with the 
newspaper sankei seiron earlier this year 
the paper quoted him as saying usjapan relations are bad 
enough because of economic frictions and could worsen next year if 
the pearl harbor anniversary brings more bad feelings 
japan has apologized to south korea and china for its military 
actions in the 1930s and 1940s no official apology has been issued 
to the united states 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he was not aware of any effort to promote an apology 
sassa said he is part of an informal group of about 30 
government officials diplomats and journalists who meet every 
month to discuss a national grand design of japan 
sassa said other members of the group are cautious about voicing 
their views for fear of retaliation by rightwingers who have 
staged violent attacks against critics of japans role in the war 
sassa said the apology idea occurred to him in 1985 when 
richard von weizsacker president of thenwest germany included an 
apology for world war ii in a speech on the 40th anniversary of the 
nazis surrender 
japanese are afflicted with collective amnesia about the war 
but those who suffered at our hands cannot forget sassa wrote in 
an article that appeared in the yomiuri shimbun the most widely 
circulated japanese newspaper in september 
richard armitage former assistant secretary of defense said in 
a speech in tokyo last month that bush and kaifu should make 
reciprocal apologetic gestures 
he said kaifu should place a wreath on a memorial to the dead at 
pearl harbor and bush should pay homage to those who died after the 
united states dropped an atomic bomb on hiroshima aug 6 1945 
japan surrendered six days later

the death rate from lung cancer keeps increasing 
the fastest among american women but more men still die from the 
disease 
the national centers for disease control said thursday that lung 
cancer incidence and death rates for 1987 continued a pattern of 
increasing steadily for women while fluctuating or holding steady 
for men 
the national lung cancer death rate rose slightly from 1980 to 
1987 from 425 per 100000 people to 479 
the death rate for men rose by less than 5 deaths per 100000 
people from 716 to 750 while the rate for women increased by 
more than a third from 209 per 100000 in 1980 to 282 in 1987 
the cdc said 
the atlantabased federal health agency also concluded that the 
increase among women would continue into the next century 
lung cancer incidence nationwide increased from a rate of 524 
per 100000 people in 1980 to 555 in 1986 the latest year 
available and increased faster for women than for men 
previous studies have said the increasing lung cancer death rate 
among women may stem from their reduced willingness to quit 
smoking as compared to men but researchers arent sure that is 
the only reason 
i dont think its fully understood why you have some more 
rapid growing cancers for some people and not for otherssaid 
dr ronald aubert a cdc epidemiologist 
cdc researchers estimate 85 percent of lung cancer cases are 
caused by smoking not counting cases caused by secondhand smoke 
aubert said 
the statistics are consistent with historically increasing 
trends in smoking the atlantabased cdc reported 
researchers said that because peaks in smoking are historically 
followed by peaks in lung cancer as much as 35 years later the 
rate among women will likely increase for decades 
based on these trends the increases for females are not 
expected to plateau until after the year 2013 the cdc said 
in general lung cancer death rates in the 1980s have been 
higher for black men than for white men but did not differ 
significantly between white and black women surveys have shown 
that black men are more likely to smoke and to smoke cigarettes 
higher in tar and nicotine the cdc said

treatment of breast cancer and other womens 
diseases is still hindered by ignorance about female biology two 
researchers say 
theres no research on the normal breast said dr susan 
love an author and professor of surgery at harvard therefore 
we dont have a clue when carcinogens are acting 
yet breast cancer will strike one woman in 10 in her lifetime 
and will kill 44000 this year she said 
it is appalling that in 1990 we have little or no information 
on the natural course of the endocrine and tissue changes that 
occur during menopause said barbara sherwin of mcgill 
university 
the two medical experts were among more than 100 physicians and 
other scientists who gathered for a symposium on forging a 
womens health research agenda they spoke thursday 
although panelists looked specifically at breast cancer 
menopause cardiovascular disease and clinical pharmacology there 
were many common threads and a common set of recommendations 
a key recommendation was that medical professionals consider 
closely but also look beyond the biological factors unique to women 
such as the menstrual cycle pregnancy and hormonal differences 
they said professionals also need to gather data on individual 
patients social and economic status as risk factors poverty 
raising children alone and on psychosocial factors such as 
depression occupational stress and the multiple demands on women 
as mothers workers and spouses

japan has hoarded crude oil in the months 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait despite agreement among most 
consuming nations to draw down stockpiles and ease supply problems 
a senior energy department official claims 
the matter will likely be raised next week at a meeting of the 
governing board of the international energy agency said linda 
stuntz an energy department deputy under secretary for policy and 
planning 
the parisbased agency is responsible for coordinating responses 
by oil consuming nations in an oil supply emergency 
if everybody in the world did what japan is doing we would 
have a much more serious problem than we do prices would be a lot 
higher said ms stuntz in remarks to a group of reporters 
she later said in an interview that she did not want to 
overstate the concern but added that japans actions raise 
questions about the success of future cooperative activities among 
consuming nations in response to oil supply shocks 
ms stuntz said that in the months after the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait last august us oil companies and most companies in europe 
drew down crude oil stocks in order to keep supplies adequate 
without having to dramatically increase imports 
but she said the japanese rather than drawing down crude oil 
stocks after the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti oil elected instead to 
continue importing at high levels and in fact increased imports 
to meet additional demand

iraqi president saddam husseins surprise 
announcement that all foreigners can go home helped weaken the 
dollar today in tokyo and sent share prices up traders said 
the dollar closed at 13217 yen down 188 yen from thursdays 
close at 13405 yen after opening at 13258 yen it ranged from 
13210 yen to 13280 yen 
the days spot trading totaled some 933 billion compared with 
868 billion the previous day 
market players sold dollars as the news of the hostage release 
dimmed prospects of military action in the middle east said ikuo 
ikenaga a dealer at the security pacific national bank 
in recent weeks the dollar has tended to rise over speculation 
of increasing international tensions as investors seek a safehaven 
currency 
on the other hand the likelihood of a peaceful solution in the 
gulf is favorable for the yen because of japans almost total 
dependence on oil imports 
dealers said subsequent technical adjustments prevented a 
drastic decline of the dollar 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average ended 
at 2352249 points up 96939 points or 430 percent from 
thursdays finish at 2255310 points 
brokers said optimism about peace in the middle east was the 
biggest marketaffecting factor on an active trading day volume on 
the first section totaled 570 million shares 
this is big news because no one had been buying but there was 
buying today said masahiro umemori a researcher at nomura 
securities co 
he said the timing of the news was good because it came when 
everyone was pessimistic and lethargic and share prices were 
heading toward hitting bottom if it had come when the market was 
rallying the news would not have had the same impact he added 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds rose to 8731 points from thursdays 
close of 8668 their yield fell to 7210 percent from 7345

lightning detectors will be used to track 
ash clouds spewed by alaskan volcanos allowing jetliners to bypass 
the clouds and avoid clogged engines which nearly caused an 
airline disaster last year 
the lightningdetection system will help us warn the airline 
industry so they can divert airplanes and prevent crashes said 
tom miller scientistincharge of the us geological surveys 
alaska volcano observatory 
volcanic ash plumes generate lightning bolts scientists dont 
know why but it means lightning detectors can be used to find and 
track ash clouds from redoubt volcano and others in alaska 
thats useful information at a volcano you cant see most of 
the time because of bad weather and short winter days said rick 
hoblitt the usgs cascades volcano observatory volcanologist who 
dreamed up the idea of using the detectors to protect jetliners 
the new 100000 system of sensors will be installed in february 
to protect heavy traffic at anchorage international airport 
geological survey researchers said thursday at the american 
geophysical unions fall meeting 
the detection system consists of directionfinding antennas and 
radio receivers that sense radio signals from lightning and a 
central computer that uses the information to pinpoint the 
lightning 
the sensors will be installed at palmer homer lake iliamna and 
squentna alaska not at the anchorage airport itself 
even in good weather the pilot of a klm boeing 747400 jumbo 
jet failed to detect an ash cloud from redoubt volcano last dec 
15 a day after the 10197foot volcano started erupting for the 
first time since 1968 
the plane traveling from amsterdam to tokyo via anchorage flew 
into the cloud and all four engines stalled 
for nine terrifying minutes the plane and its 245 passengers 
and crew members plunged in a powerless glide from 28000 feet to 
13000 feet the engines were restarted just in time to prevent the 
jet from hitting 11000foottall mountains in the area 
redoubt 110 miles southwest of anchorage repeatedly spewed ash 
up to 40000 feet since last december a snowcovered lava dome in 
its summit crater threatens to trigger steam eruptions and send 
more ash skyward any time miller said 
after the klm jets nearcrash a boeing 727 and two 737s also 
flew into redoubts ash clouds and sustained minor damage last 
december and february three jumbo jets had close calls similar to 
the klm incident when they flew into ash clouds from indonesian 
volcanos during the 1980s 
thunderstorms are rare around anchorage in winter so there 
wont be a problem of confusing storm lightning with bolts from the 
volcanic clouds miller said

african national congress 
leader nelson mandela says his organization is rethinking its 
support of economic sanctions but wants present measures kept in 
place for the time being 
mandela in a letter thursday to european community leaders 
called on the group to delay any new decisions on sanctions until 
early next year 
the ec leaders are to meet next week in rome there have been 
indications some member countries may support a relaxation of the 
sanctions imposed to protest apartheid 
the anc south africas leading black opposition movement has 
been the leading proponent of comprehensive sanctions to put 
pressure on the whiteled government it has repeatedly said 
sanctions should be maintained until there was irreversible 
change toward dismantling apartheid 
manela said the anc was reviewing its sanctions policy to reach 
a position common to the majority of antiapartheid forces in the 
country 
the anc is to hold a major conference dec 1416 and 
reevaluating sanctions was expected to be a leading issue 
it is too early to begin celebrating the lifting of 
sanctions said business day an antiapartheid newspaper that 
opposes sanctions 
but the anc could be on the brink of moderating it 
uncompromising support of sanctions the newspaper said 
business day reported thursday that sports and cultural 
sanctions supported by the anc could be lifted first followed by 
economic sanctions 
western european nations and the united states have maintained 
limited economic sanctions against south africa in recent years 
but the countries have praised president fw de klerks reforms 
and said sanctions would eventually be lifted if he continued with 
his stated plans to end aparthied 
the government says that blacks suffer the most from the 
economic hardships caused by sanctions 
despite economic damage from the sanctions south africa still 
has the continents strongest economy and its main trade partners 
are western europe the united states and japan 
south africa also says it trades with every african country 
mostly in secret it also has established trade links with several 
east european countries that used to be leading backers of the anc

the publisher of the strikebound daily news 
accused new yorks mayor and police of ignoring evidence that 
strikers conspired to destroy the newspaper with violence and 
intimidation 
the allegations by james hoge came thursday after a replacement 
driver was beaten and stabbed about 12 hours after he was summoned 
to testify before a grand jury investigating strike violence 
i submit that the police need to face up to what is clearly 
the reality today in this community the gangsters are running 
free and nobody is willing to say what is really occurring hoge 
said 
instead we have public officials that are hiding behind 
technical and innocuous statements and that is not living up to 
the full responsibility of officials who have sworn to uphold the 
law 
hoge urged mayor david dinkins to speak out more forcefully 
dinkins earlier called on all parties to denounce violence and a 
mayoral spokesman said police and dinkins had responded fairly to 
complaints from both sides 
the newspaper offered a 100000 reward for information about 
the attack early thursday in irvington nj 
police said 15 men armed with baseball bats bottles and a knife 
attacked replacement driver carlos chacon 45 of harrison nj 
he was stabbed in the buttocks and abdomen and a helper derrick 
foster 27 of newark nj was cut and bruised police said 
chacon was hospitalized thursday in satisfactory condition 
foster was treated and released 
police said the victims heard one attacker say these people 
that work for the daily news are taking my job im going to kill 
you 
hoge stopped short of saying the grand jury summons and the 
stabbing were directly linked 
chacon was called as a potential witness for an investigation 
into an oct 27 incident in which a striking daily news driver 
allegedly smashed a delivery trucks headlights and windows hoge 
said 
nine of the newspapers 10 unions have been on strike since oct 
25 
union officials decried the stabbing and denied hoges 
accusations 
the highest police officials of this city have refuted these 
charges jim hoge repeating something over and over like a parrot 
doesnt make a conspiracy said newspaper guild head barry 
lipton this is meaningless babble from a desperate man

filipinos are stocking up on 
necessities in anticipation that oil prices driven up sharply by 
the persian gulf crisis and government subsidy cuts will spark 
inflation across the board 
the government of president corazon aquino this week ordered a 
30 percent increase of the gas price to 281 a gallon other fuel 
prices also increased by an average of 45 percent 
the increases announced wednesday and thursday are expected to 
double the cost of public transport and lead to sharply higher 
prices for food electricity and other essentials 
it now costs more to fill the tank of a midsized car than a 
public school teacher earns in a week 
thousands of shoppers jammed manila supermarkets following the 
fuel hikes to stock up on canned goods cooking oil and other basic 
supplies before prices on those items go up 
spot checks of several markets showed prices for fish chicken 
and pork had increased about 7 percent since the fuel price hike 
sen orlando mercado chairman of the senate commerce committee 
called the increases an act of national suicide and joined sen 
ernesto maceda and opposition sen juan ponce enrile in calling for 
mrs aquino to resign 
communist rebels threatened to bomb gas stations that increase 
their gas prices in the city of cagayan de oro 500 miles south of 
manila 
about 4000 students of the bukidnon state college southeast of 
cagayan staged a one day walkout to protest the new prices 
the government said the fuel price increase was brought on by 
higher crude oil prices since the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 
august the philippines imports most of its crude oil 
world oil prices have fallen since the invasion but the 
government has subsidized the oil products it refines for years 
and the price increase was also due to measures included in an 
austerity program pushed by the international monetary fund 
stunned by the increases dozens of angry filipinos have been 
telephoning callin shows on manila radio stations to vent their 
anger 
cory aquino is like a doll a puppet of her advisers 
caller loy trinidad told radio station dzrh 
one supermarket shopper ria teves said she had to wrestle a 
can of cooking oil away from a clerk who tried to remove it from 
her shopping cart to mark a higher price 
i scolded her and told her off mrs teves said 
at another supermarket housewife rosalinda mundo said she had 
planned to do the monthly shopping next week but changed her mind 
after fuel prices were increased 
if i wait my budget will get me only half as much she 
said theyre trying to take the food right out of our mouths 
taxi driver exquiel valenzuela was refusing to pick up 
passengers unless they agreed in advance to pay more than the 
metered fare he said drivers could not earn enough money to buy 
gasoline at the new prices and still clear a profit 
the government has dug our graves for us and is just waiting 
for us to jump in said valenzuela a father of four

stanislaw tyminski returned to poland two 
months ago presenting himself as a successful technocrat who would 
use western business acumen to reverse the nations economic 
crisis 
but the picture that emerged of lech walesas surprise 
challenger in the countrys first popular presidential election 
turned out to be something different a vague ideologue who has 
ties to the former communist party believes in esp and threatens 
political opponents with secret documents 
nobody knew the truth about tyminski said emilia bargiel of 
jastrzebie saying she was ashamed to have voted for him in the 
first round nov 25 she said she will cast her vote for walesa in 
the runoff sunday 
finally the journalists found out too late for many 
people 
tyminskis comefromnowhere bid which eliminated prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki from the race was so fast and 
unexpected in this new democracy that some feel like they just 
missed getting hit by a train 
now three opinion polls show walesa with a widening lead two 
days before the 27 million polish voters make their choice 
if the tyminski surge has been stopped it is because a 
gradually sharper picture has emerged of the man once referred to 
as a polish indiana jones when he strode into the political 
arena early in october 
labeling himself the campaigns only independent candidate 
he told a ragstoriches story 
according to tyminski he left poland in 1969 with the 
equivalent of 5 in his pocket worked as a gardener in sweden 
emigrated to canada where he made his first aftertax million in 
computers by 1980 then removed himself to the amazonian city of 
iquitos peru to find spiritual rebirth in the jungle returned to 
canada in 1986 and is now ready to share his knowledge with his 
compatriots 
financial success put him in one of the higher places among 
canadas wealthy his campaign literature boasted in a country 
where the rich uncle from america is part of the national folklore 
tyminskis campaign soon found believers 
he was among only six out of 14 wouldbe candidates able to 
collect the required 100000 nominating signatures by oct 25 
his campaign meetings around the country drew the curious and 
sent away the converted highquality color posters splashed his 
cleancut face on buses and walls 
while walesa and mazowiecki were slinging mud at each other 
tyminski said he was not a politician but he also told voters that 
mazowiecki was guilty of treason for economic policies that had 
destroyed polands best industries after his election he said 
the economy would improve in one month 
polls showed his support doubling weekbyweek days before the 
first round he passed mazowiecki setting off alarm bells the 
prime ministers campaign which had been gunning only at walesa 
now turned to take aim at tyminski but it proved too late 
about this time however contradictions began to appear in 
tyminskis statements and suspicions about his background 
leaders of the polish community in canada said tyminski was not 
known even to fellow polish emigres the reported his company 
employed only 14 people and his libertarian party of canada has 
3500 members and never won a seat in either a provincial or 
federal parliament 
tyminski for a time asserted that he had not returned to poland 
in years then the interior ministry confirmed he had been back 
seven times between 1980 and 1989 arriving on visas issued by the 
polish consulate in tripoli libya tyminski then admitted coming 
back but said he never was in libya 
the climax may have come at a raucous nationally televised 
twohour news conference last saturday 
there many poles heard for the first time the names and ranks of 
former communists and secret police operatives who had been active 
in the tyminski campaign that he had been married once before 
outside the catholic church and that he claimed to have had 
spiritual voyages in the peruvian jungle 
they also saw him coolly warn walesa in a style reminiscent of 
the hated security service that he had damaging personal 
materials about the solidarity chief in a black briefcase at his 
feet 
since then tyminskis campaign has been dogged by chants of 
kgb

an earthquake strong enough to shake 
dishes jolted residents of anchorage and palmer but no damage 
was immediately reported a geophysicist said 
thursday nights quake measured 50 on the richter scale and its 
epicenter was in unpopulated areas said bob hammond of the alaska 
tsunami warning center in palmer 
an earthquake of 50 magnitude can shake dishes if youre 
located right in the epicenter it could potentially crack dry 
walls things like that he said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 
times stronger than one of 65 
in 1964 an alaska quake measuring 84 killed 131 people

a day after their protests brought him 
down the enemies of ousted president hussain muhammad ershad 
demanded today that he and his ministers be tried for human rights 
violations and corruption 
ershad was replaced by supreme court chief justice shahabuddin 
ahmed who will preside over an interim government until 
parliamentary elections are held within 90 days 
political analysts doubt the interim government will initiate 
any case against ershad and his colleagues ahmed has only one 
mandate to conduct the elections but the demands for 
scoresettling official or otherwise are unlikely to abate 
a mob in dhaka on thursday beat to death a man they accused of 
being an ershad supporter witnesses said 
otherwise life in the capital was returning to normal after 
nearly two months of almost daily protests and violence 
many shops opened today on sabbath in this overwhelmingly 
moslem nation of 110 million people traffic was moving normally as 
barricades were taken down 
but the opposition was doing its part to keep the political 
flames burning 
we definitely want a trial of those who have committed crimes 
and atrocities in the past eight years said opposition leader 
khaleda zia 
mrs zia as leader of the bangladesh nationalist party and 
sheik hasina of the awami league joined forces in a series of 
protests that brought down ershad 
ershad and his ministers have amassed millions of dollars by 
cheating the nation the criminals must stand for trial said 
amir hossain amu a leader of hasinas party 
if there are complaints of corruption and misuse of power 
against someone the government should take appropriate actions in 
accordance with the laws of the land the army chief of staff 
lt gen nooruddin khan said during a televised interview thursday 
night 
ershad was the army chief when he took power in a bloodless coup 
in march 1982 he resigned from the army after winning presidential 
elections in 1986 which the opposition claimed were rigged 
charges of vote fraud also dogged the 1988 parliamentary 
elections won by ershads jatiya party the opposition made vote 
fraud the focus of their protests when ershad announced he would be 
a candidate for reelection in june 1991 
ershads resignation capped a dizzying reversal in his political 
fortunes the fraud claims and protests had been little more than 
background noise during ershads eight years in office and three 
weeks ago he was confidently predicting success in next years 
election 
but once sheik hasina and khaleda zia were able to overcome 
longstanding political differences their campaign gained new life 
it quickly spread even after ershad declared a state of emergency 
nov 27 
the opposition claims at least 100 people were killed by troops

no evidence has been found linking a foreign 
government to a former us soldier indicted for allegedly plotting 
to kill president bush and other top officials the us attorney 
for new jersey said 
us attorney michael chertoff said it does not appear jamal 
mohammed warrayat a naturalized us citizen born in kuwait had 
outside help in the alleged plot to kill bush secretary of state 
james a baker iii unspecified members of congress and to attack 
military installations in three states 
warrayat 32 was indicted thursday on three felony charges he 
could be sentenced to 15 years and fined 750000 if convicted of 
all counts 
warrayat has been held without bail since his nov 27 arrest an 
arraignment is expected within two weeks 
court papers said warrayat wanted to kill the officials because 
they were against the interests of his group but the papers did 
not describe the group or its interests further and prosecutors 
would not elaborate 
according to the court papers warrayat told an undercover fbi 
agent that his group was ready to attack bush and the others as 
well as attack unspecified military installations in north 
carolina texas and kansas he allegedly said the group was looking 
for help obtaining explosives money and technical training 
warrayats attorney terence scott was not available for 
comment thursday his secretary said 
scott has previously said warrayat was born in kuwait came to 
the united states in the early 1970s and served about four years in 
the army until 1979 
scott said that until recently his client worked as a taxi 
driver but was unemployed at the time of his arrest

the judge who set bail at 300000 for the 
alleged killer of rabbi meir kahane suspended it a day later and 
the district attorney said the original motion granting bail was 
made over his objections 
state supreme court justice alvin schlesinger who approved the 
300000 bail for el sayyid nosair on wednesday suspended it on 
thursday and scheduled a new bail hearing for monday 
district attorney robert morgenthau said thursday that his 
office had requested nosair be held without bail 
we pointed out to the court that he is accused of committing a 
number of exceptionally serious crimes including both the murder 
of rabbi kahane and the wounding of a federal police officer 
morgenthau said 
nosair 35 of cliffside park nj is accused of shooting the 
zionist activist last month as kahane finished a speech at a new 
york city hotel he also is accused of wounding two other men as he 
fled 
one of the two a postal service police officer wounded nosair 
in a statement to police attached to a disclosure form filed in 
court nosair told police kahane was actually shot by another 
person and that he was framed he said he went to hear kahanes 
lecture because he agreed with much of the rabbis philosophy

given saddam husseins record the bush 
administration is offering a subdued response to baghdads surprise 
announcement that all 900 americans held in iraq and kuwait will be 
freed 
the hostages release is one of the three principal us demands 
made of the iraqi president since his lightning takeover of kuwait 
in august president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
still insist on fulfillment of the other two a total withdrawal 
and restoration of the overthrown kuwaiti government 
freeing the hostages including 88 held as human shields at 
strategic locations could serve saddams purposes by contributing 
to the rising opposition among congress and the public to a use of 
military force 
with the iraqi leader capitulating to one demand why not wait 
for the worldwide trade embargo and other economic sanctions to 
squeeze saddam into giving up kuwait 
but before that argument can get very far the american hostages 
have to be freed and they are not out yet 
the state department through broadcasts on the voice of 
america advised the americans to remain where they were until 
arrangements are made for their rescue 
the iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat said he expected 
the release within days 
in a televised interview today he said iraqi officials are 
arranging for flights and exit visas for the hostages 
we are speeding the process of their departure almashat 
said on abctvs good morning america 
the envoy said iraq was willing to release the hostages because 
there is more hope for peace and because of planned talks with 
us officials he said iraq was expecting absolutely nothing 
in return 
an additional 2250 us citizens and foreignborn family 
members have been allowed to leave since the takeover of kuwait so 
it may simply be a matter of making arrangements over a few days 
before the 900 are liberated 
and yet the hostages are an extremely valuable bargaining chip 
especially those being used as human shields to deter us attack 
administration officials have denounced their detention and 
the sporadic release of other americans as a cruel manipulation 
of people and their families 
bush has said many times that in deciding whether to attack iraq 
or take other actions to liberate kuwait he would not be held 
hostage to saddams hostage policy 
even so it would be difficult to imagine the president ordering 
an assault on an installation where americans were held prisoner 
throughout the fivemonth crisis us hopes have been boosted 
and dashed by various statements from iraq 
early on there were pledges to leave kuwait if the united 
states promised not to attack but kuwait remains under iraqi 
occupation 
us diplomats eager to visit american hostages were told it was 
only a matter of making proper arrangements but they applied and 
were denied access anyway 
mercurial is a cliched adjective commonly applied to saddam 
another is unpredictable 
he fought a bloody war with iran for eight years and then 
suddenly relinquished all his territorial gains and agreed to a 
ceasefire 
saddam appeared to be moderating his policies inducing the 
reagan and bush administrations to be a little friendlier and 
then with dramatic suddenness came the aug 2 blitzkrieg invasion 
of kuwait 
bush welcomed the announcement thursday that the hostages would 
be released but he said the united states must not let its war 
footing in the persian gulf slip weve got to continue to keep 
the pressure on he said while traveling in south america 
hopeful but cautious bush also cited the easing of iraqs 
pressure on the us embassy in kuwait and said it seems to be a 
little movement here a little movement there 
but the president and others in the administration are not 
cheering yet

the persian gulf area on the april 15 taxfiling deadline will have 
an an extra 60 days to file their 1990 federal tax returns 
in announcing the automatic extension the internal revenue 
service said thursday that interest will be charged as usual on any 
tax not paid by the regular deadline the agency said it has no 
authority under the law to waive that requirement

a refund and so would not face the interest charge the agency said 
it will work closely with the defense department in providing 
taxreturn assistance to members of the armed forces

extension would be granted if conditions warrant

federal officials attempted to calm 
worried residents evacuated from floodravaged housing that tests 
showing the presence of high levels of cancercausing pcbs dont 
necessarily mean they are in danger 
milton clark a pcb specialist with the us environmental 
protection agency told residents attending a public meeting that 
while longterm exposure may be harmful brief exposure poses 
little hazard 
in the short term youre not at risk he said thursday 
the residents of about 120 homes were barred from returning to 
their houses after the pcbs were found wednesday 
residents in the 270home wicker park subdivision had begun 
returning monday to gather personal items from homes damaged last 
week when 6 inches of rain caused flooding 
test results shared by the epa led the state to declare the 
houses offlimits the epa said it found double the acceptable 
levels of pcbs 
tests for pcbs were conducted after highland officials reported 
seeing a sheen on floodwaters 
the cause of the contamination had not been determined 
jim lynch a spokesman for the indiana department of 
environmental management told reporters that officials were 
researching the history of the area he said there were indications 
the neighborhood had been a dumping area but did not 
elaborate 
pcbs once commonly used as insulation in electrical 
transformers were banned by the federal government as a 
cancercausing substance in the 1970s 
residents of wicker park estates in highland and other areas hit 
hard by flooding last week did get some good news thursday when 
president bush declared lake county a disaster area 
the disaster declaration will enable lake countys flood victims 
to get lowinterest loans and other assistance on a casebycase 
basis

a woman seeking guardianship of her 
braindamaged lesbian lover says she would never keep her from 
seeing her estranged parents 
karen thompson a professor at st cloud state university said 
sharon kowalski 34 has already suffered enough after a 1983 
traffic accident left her without the use of her limbs and barely 
able to speak 
i never want to put her in the position that she has to choose 
between her biological family and chosen family thompson told 
st louis county district judge robert campbell on thursday 
the hearing scheduled to end today is expected to cap a 
fiveyear guardianship struggle that has pitted thompson against 
kowalskis parents don and della kowalski of nashwauk have since 
said they lack the energy and the money to keep fighting for their 
daughter whom they sequestered from thompson for 3 years 
since last year she has been cared for at a nursing home in 
suburban robbinsdakem pending ms thompsons petition 
the dispute has been followed closely by gay rights advocates 
who maintain thompson is best suited to care for kowalski the two 
lived together for four years before the accident thompson said 
and considered themselves secretly married 
a physician said thursday that kowalskis emotional and physical 
wellbeing are on the line if thompson is barred from becoming her 
guardian 
sharon communicates with karen in a way no one else does 
said dr gail gregor a rehabilitation consultant karen is the 
key to her past self and the window into who she is now she 
chooses not to interact unless karen is with her 
on the subject of kowalskis parents gregor said they have had 
such infrequent contact with their daughter since they gave up 
guardianship that it may make little difference if they never see 
her again

after a white mob cornered and fatally shot a 
black teenager prosecuters had counted on john vento to talk he 
was part of that gang and agreed to be a witness in exchange for 
immunity 
but he backed out of the deal and fled the city before 
ultimately deciding to surrender and face trial rather than testify 
against pals from bensonhurst the predominantly white brooklyn 
neighborhood where the black teen was killed 
prosecutors called ventos move a doublecross and said his 
change of heart hurt the cases against other defendants two were 
cleared this week on all major charges 
on thursday vento 22 was acquitted of murder and manslaughter 
in the august 1989 slaying of 16yearold yusuf hawkins vento was 
convicted of riot yes yes yes he bellowed slamming his 
hands on the defense table as the verdict was read crying and 
screaming he grabbed and hugged his lawyer before he was 
restrained by court officers 
the riot conviction carries a maximum term of one and onethird 
years to four years in prison which could run concurrently or be 
added to a longer term he received from prior convictions in the 
case 
reached by telephone juror gay fallows said all i will tell 
you is it was a very very difficult case and very difficult 
decision 
the trial was the second for vento in july a jury convicted 
him of unlawful imprisonment and menacing but acquitted him of the 
most serious charge he faced intentional murder 
its always hard to convict someone when he was not the 
trigger man prosecutor paul burns said 
prosecutors were able to retry vento because the jury deadlocked 
on two of the charges in july and a few weeks later a grand jury 
added a seconddegree manslaughter count 
he is serving a sentence of two and twothirds to eight years in 
prison for the first two convictions 
jjoseph fama convicted of murder and other crimes is serving 32 
and twothirds years to life keith mondello the organizer of the 
mob was acquitted of murder and manslaughter but was sentenced to 
up to 16 years in prison for convictions of other crimes 
three other defendants are scheduled to stand trial early next 
year

crews expected to finish transferring 35 
million gallons of alaska crude oil from a damaged tanker to 
another ship by tonight as long as seas remained calm the coast 
guard said 
the transfer from the 815foot keystone canyon which had a 
cracked ballast tank to the 669foot kenai about 150 miles west of 
san francisco began thursday afternoon 
no oil had spilled from the tanker but the transfer was 
necessary because the 20foot vertical crack in a starboard ballast 
tank in the midsection compromised the ships stability said 
quartermaster dennis krumel no oil was in the ballast tank which 
is filled at varying levels with water 
crews had planned to start moving the oil by wednesday evening 
but were delayed by 15foot ocean swells coast guard commander 
scot tiernan said the transfer finally began thursday in calmer 
seas with 10 to 12foot waves and wind about 10 mph the coast 
guard said 
the shiptoship transfer was a reasonably rare occurrence 
said tiernan chief of port operations at the marine safety office 
in san francisco 
in general you dont offload 120 miles offshore he said 
it shouldnt be a big deal but theyre taking all the 
precautions they can 
crews unloading up to 35000 barrels an hour expected the 
transfer to take 30 hours 
the kenais capacity 835000 barrels or 35 million gallons is 
about 15000 barrels smaller than the keystone canyon and all but 
that amount will be transferred tiernan said the kenai will take 
the cargo to refineries in el segundo calif he said 
the keystone canyon is owned by the connecticut national bank of 
hartford conn and operated by the philadelphiabased keystone 
shipping co the crude oil load is owned by bp oil

relatives of about 900 american hostages were waiting today for 
iraqs saddam hussein to follow through on his promise to release 
all foreign guests in time for christmas 
all we can do now is live in the hope that he really is coming 
home said shirley carroll of augusta ga whose husband is 
among holdouts at the us embssy in kuwait 
its more or less a waitandsee game said elsie lucille 
hughes of albuquerque nm whose husband and son are hiding in 
kuwait were waiting to see whether its got conditions 
attached to it or not 
family and friends of american captives were elated by the iraqi 
presidents turnaround but they were also wary of tricks for 
those with loved ones in hiding such a prospect was especially 
fearsome 
if you take saddam at face value then theyre going to be 
released said attorney david mcdonald jr whose client and 
friend is among those in hiding the question then becomes when 
is this a ploy to draw everyone out 
doubts aside the promise brought new hope to families 
weve been waiting and waiting trying and trying to get him 
out and hitting brick walls said sue iliff whose brother is 
among holdouts at the us embassy in kuwait so this first ray 
of hope is like a gift 
saddam called for the release of all hostages in a directive 
approved overwhelmingly today by the iraqi parliament the 
government said foreigners could start applying for exit visas 
immediately 
were really emotional about this because christmas is a big 
holiday with our family a very special time of year mrs 
iliff said from stover mo but were being careful 
marie butcher spoke with her soninlaw guy seago thursday by 
telephone from the military installation where he has been held by 
iraqi troops 
hes packed and ready to leave i warned him it might take 
some time to get out but hes still just so thrilled mrs 
butcher said from johnson city tenn weve got all our christmas 
presents wrapped and ready 
marjorie walterscheid received a similar call from her husband 
rainard walterscheid one of a group of american oil workers taken 
off their rigs and into custody by iraqi troops 
he said im ready to come home im really you know im 
really tired i just want to get home get back to work she 
said from jacksboro texas and i said well maybe wed go on a 
honeymoon or something he just kind of laughed

nato defense ministers agreed in 
principle today on a postcold war defense strategy of reduced us 
presence in europe smaller forces and a continued mix of 
conventional and nuclear arms 
our future force posture will be based on smaller more mobile 
and flexible active forces able to respond to aggression from any 
quarter the ministers said in a communique 
they said the persian gulf crisis served as an example of 
continuing risks of aggression from outside nato territory that 
have a bearing on the vital security interests of the allies 
the nato allies pledged to maintain military and other pressures 
to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
the gulf crisis presents a fundamental challenge to the vision 
of a peaceful world order the ministers said 
the communique said a draft resolution on natos future was 
discussed during the twoday meeting at nato headquarters in 
brussels and would be adopted next year 
nuclear weapons play a key role in the prevention of war 
and the maintenance of stability the communique said it 
restated natos desire for ussoviet negotiations on reducing 
shortrange nuclear missiles in europe 
ussoviet negotiations begin next year on reducing shortrange 
missiles which have a range of up to 310 miles 
nato chief manfred woerner and us defense secretary dick 
cheney said the allies remain committed to reduce natos 
shortrange nuclear arsenal freefall bombs groundlaunched 
lance missiles and artillery through negotiations with moscow 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said earlier he saw 
a consensus emerging that the allies were ready to remove all of 
these arms nato has said it will not modernize the lance missiles 
and nuclear artillery but deployment of a new tactical 
airtosurface missile remains under study 
cheney said on thursday that the threat of a massive warsaw pact 
invasion had been replaced by new dangers for the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
these include lingering threats from the soviet union potential 
instability in eastern europe the spread of chemical arms and 
ballistic missiles in the middle east and possible threats to 
energy supplies he said 
officials said the new strategy to be finalized early next 
year will provide for a continued presence of nuclear arms in 
europe albeit in greatly reduced numbers 
on the gulf crisis cheney and british defense secretary tom 
king asked their allies for more help in moving troops and 
equipment to the middle east 
cheney said he asked the allies for more help in providing ships 
and planes for transport of us troops to the gulf he said he 
also asked for additional heavy combat and air defense forces 
to help push iraq out of kuwait he reported a generally 
favorable response but no specific pledges of help 
he added that saddams decision to free all foreign hostages 
altered neither american deployment plans nor its insistence that 
iraq withdraw 
the only acceptable outcome is for saddam hussein to withdraw 
all his forces from kuwait and to allow the restoration of the 
legitimate government of kuwait he said 
the allies reiterated their readiness to go to war unless iraqi 
president saddam hussein pulls his forces out of kuwait by jan 15 
as required by a nov 29 united nations resolution 
the united states has about 250000 troops in the gulf region 
and plans to increase its force to more than 400000 
britain with the secondlargest foreign army in the area plans 
to bring its force to over 30000 in the next few weeks

hordes of roman catholic faithful are 
flocking to see an image on the wall of a church in california that 
many believe depicts the virgin mary 
i think its a miracle said marie cammarota 60 of 
sacramento after filing through st dominics church on thursday 
she waited with about 5000 others in a line that extended a 
quartermile at its peak and turned the chief of the small police 
force into a traffic cop competition for parking in the sierra 
nevada town of 1000 was fierce a christmas tree lot next door 
charged 5 per car 
church representatives said a few people slept overnight in the 
church parking lot to be near the front of the line that begins 
taking shape more than two hours before the hourlong appearance of 
the image starting at 930 am 
some visitors took the day off from work and parents kept their 
children out of school to witness the image 
many prayed as they passed through the 250seat church some 
wept 
staring at the image the seated congregation the first 250 in 
line in this case recited the rosary which includes the phrase 
holy mary mother of god 
some werent so sure it was a miracle it was weird i think 
its what you want it to be if youre into religion then you see 
the virgin mary said tyler palacio 13 
the rev patrick joseph of chicago who was among those who have 
traveled the farthest said he thought the miracle was outside the 
church among the faithful 
people arent coming together because they are sure it is a 
miracle he said theyre coming here to pray that it might 
be 
everyone agreed they had seen something it started as faint 
curved lines of mostly red blue green purple and pink light the 
lines darkened and extended into a shape that looked like the top 
half of a figure then it gradually faded away 
some of the lines were sharp others fuzzy leading some 
observers to describe the image as forming on the wall and others 
to say it stood out from the wall like a holograph 
the image appears above a statue of jesus on a wall that faces 
the sun therefore the image cannot be directly cast by sunlight 
filtering through a stainedglass window 
but a light fixture hanging from the roof is possibly in 
position to reflect the colored light coming through the window 
back onto the wall 
the reflection theory was discounted by those who said the image 
has appeared on cloudy days 
bishop francis quinn of the sacramento diocese which includes 
the town about 45 miles east of sacramento said if the image 
continues he will establish a commission to investigate 
police chief bill mintline said the effects of the crowd are 
brief because most visitors leave shortly after the image fades at 
about 1030 am and those who come dont cause any trouble he 
said 
its not like a rock concert crowd mintline said 
st dominics refuses to commercialize the apparition 
the church is trying not to capitalize on this were not 
accepting any donations said bernie molloy a volunteer helping

unidentified gunmen believed to be using ak47 rifles fired 
through the doors of homes killing the three men in evaton south 
of johannesburg police said seven people also were injured in

5000 people in natal in the past five years it spread to 
johannesburgarea townships in august and about 1000 people have 
died 
meanwhile a race relations group said attacks on black 
policemen and black township councilors occurred an average of 
twice daily and killed 28 people from january through july 
many blacks consider black policemen and township leaders to be 
collabrators with the whiteled government and the apartheid 
system of racial segregation under apartheid blacks live in 
segregated areas that lack the amenities and services of white 
areas 
the independent south african institute of race relations said 
the 409 incidents it counted in the sevenmonth period included 309 
attacks on homes of black policemen and town council members 
usually with firebombs or other forms of arson 
more than 400 town councilors resigned most of them citing 
intimidation by township residents the group said thursday it 
also said johannesburgs englishlanguage newspapers neglected to 
report the nature of the attacks 
many articles said pressure caused the councilors to 
resign the group said quite a number failed to mention that 
this pressure has frequently been so violent that the term 
pressure is a euphemism 
the group said six black policemen and 22 councilors had been 
killed in the attacks it cited the killing of one councilor by the 
necklace method in which the victim has a tire placed around the 
neck gets doused in gasoline and set on fire

american soldiers had a message 
for saddam hussein today its great the hostages may be home for 
christmas but the gis arent going home until kuwait is free 
air force staff sgt chester smolarczyk who said iraq appears 
to be stalling for time but stumbling toward peace said hes 
willing to wait 
which is cheaper blood or oil asked the 28yearold 
polishborn cargo handler from jacksonville ark 
news of saddams surprise promise to free the hostages was only 
filtering into saudi arabia this morning 
from the newest arrivals to soldiers whove been in the desert 
for nearly four months there was a feeling that something was 
happening that might affect them but they werent sure exactly 
what it was nor did they trust saddam 
hes saying it but whether he does it or not is a different 
thing you can never trust a guy like that said air force sgt 
david klunker 25 of salt lake city who was playing backgammon 
during a break from unloading cargo at an air base 
saddams announcement came as advance parties and the first 
combat units of the 200000 us reinforcements for operation 
desert shield were arriving in saudi arabia they will give the 
240000 troops already in place enough strength for an offensive 
against saddam if he refuses to pull out of kuwait 
if he didnt want to back down he wouldnt be freeing the 
hostages so quick said air force staff sgt william briggs 52 
of columbia sc whose 169th service battalion in the national 
guard was mobilized for the buildup 
one way or the other he is going to give in because well see 
to that he said then again everything will be determined 
jan 15 
a un resolution set a jan 15 deadline for saddam to pull out 
of kuwait without facing the possibility of military action by the 
usled multinational force which includes 100000 other troops 
from about 25 other countries 
first sgt jerry carlton 37 of warsaw nc whose 82nd 
airborne unit landed in saudi arabia on aug 9 said the hostage 
release could signal that saddam was caving in or trying to buy 
additional time 
i think its great theyre going home said 1st lt brian 
ratchford 26 of spartanburg sc from the 39th tactical air 
squadron but its not about the hostages i think the hostages 
were a bad side effect of this whole thing

a teenager who was at the wheel of the the 
car when two skinhead friends picked a black person at random 
and killed him was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in 
the 1988 murder 
angela stanley 18 sat motionless through most of thursdays 
90minute hearing but wept quietly as washoe district judge brent 
adams handed down the sentence 
stanley pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder in the dec 10 
1988 shooting of tony montgomery 27 in his sisters front yard

skinheads matthew faessel 19 and michael stringer 18 
faessel and stringer were convicted of firstdegree murder and face 
two consecutive life prison terms at their sentencing dec 20 
trial testimony showed that stringer rolled down the window of 
the car stanley was driving and faessel fired the fatal shot 
in my view angela stanley was the least culpable of the 
three said assistant district attorney ed basl 
witnesses said the three white teenagers became enraged at a 
party attended by skinheads when a woman told them she had been 
raped by a black man 
at her hearing stanley denied having the white supremacist 
neonazi beliefs some skinheads have embraced in recent years

her life but urged the court to impose a long enough sentence to 
ensure a prolonged supervised parole 
stanley who has already served two years in custody will be 
eligible for parole in three years

stanley was a 16yearold street kid who sought the affections of 
those who were not good

art buchwalds suit against paramount 
pictures entered its second phase with the humorists attorneys 
arguing the studio gave him a raw deal 
the pulitzer prizewinning columnist won the first part of the 
case when superior court judge harvey schneider ruled the 1986 
eddie murphy blockbuster coming to america was based on a 
buchwald work titled king for a day 
thursdays proceeding was to determine the fairness of the 
contract buchwald and bernheim signed with paramount in 1983 
schneider must determine the amount of money buchwald and his 
partner producer alain bernheim should receive in the case during 
a third phase of the trial 
the blockbuster film grossed more than 300 million in box 
office receipts but paramount says it still hasnt earned a profit 
and is actually 18 million in the red therefore the company 
argues buchwald and bernheims share of the profits amounts to 
nothing 
buchwald attorney pierce odonnell told schneider the contract 
showed how hollywoods netprofit agreements are unfair 
paramount says a deal is a deal we say buchwald and 
bernheim got a raw deal odonnell said 
netprofit agreements grant individuals a share of a films net 
profits after the motion picture company recovers its costs and an 
agreedupon rate of return critics say that the arrangements can 
result in unfairness if the studio artificially inflates the cost 
of a film and thus reduces or eliminates the profit 
paramount attorney charles diamond said the studio was to 
receive approximately 175 times its costs before sharing profits 
from coming to america paramount has not disclosed the cost of 
making the film 
buchwald and bernheim were to receive a combined 265000 and up 
to 40 percent of net profits under the contract 
in court papers buchwald and bernheim contended their share of 
the movies profits should be between 69 million and 146 
million 
we dont have to pay these gentlemen until we have recouped 
all our costs from the revenue diamond said 
courts in this country ought not to be remaking deals for 
parties diamond said 
buchwald who attended thursdays session said he was 
pessimistic about the outcome of the suit 
im always prepared for the worst he said i cant 
believe ill win

some former political prisoners 
already rehabilitated but waiting for financial compensation will 
get an advance payment of 417 before christmas a finance ministry 
official said today 
however the measure will only apply to those rehabilitated in 
the czech lands not in slovakia he added 
under a law enacted earlier this year former political 
prisoners are entitled to about 100 for each month spent in jail 
and to compensation payments for impaired health and legal costs 
incurred 
the federal government has earmarked millions of dollars for 
cash payments to be made to former political prisoners and millions 
of dollars to be set aside in bonds 
the list of those who applied for the advance payment includes 
some 1400 people said hynek rasocha of the czech finance 
ministry 
it is a good thing because many of them are very old and 
poor he said indicating that some of them may not live long 
enough to be able to collect their full financial compensation 
indemnification of former political prisoners falls under the 
jurisdiction of the ministry of justice which does not have 
sufficient personnel for the swift processing of applications 
some 70000 people unjustly sentenced in political trials in 
over four decades of communist rule have been rehabilitated already 
in the czech lands and 20000 in slovakia only 430 of them have 
received financial compensation

world leaders welcomed iraqs decision today to 
free all foreign hostages but demanded it take the next step and 
withdraw from kuwait 
only iran and the plo failed to temper their applause by urging 
iraq to undo the damage done by its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
european stock and oil markets were quiet following the iraqi 
parliaments approval today of saddam husseins decision dealers 
said the markets had already reacted to the iraqi presidents 
announcement thursday and noted the parliament has never vetoed one 
of his recommendations 
british prime minister john major said saddam hussein has a 
lot more to do in terms of un security council resolutions and 
the international community will require him to do it all 
the whole world believes that saddam should disgorge kuwait 
release hostages and make reparations for what he has done major 
told bbc radio 
president bush also said saddams announcement would be 
welcome if true but it will not change my thinking on his need to 
comply 100 percent without condition to the un resolutions 
that demand an iraqi pull out from kuwait bush spoke in chile one 
stop on his south american tour 
last week the un security council authorized the use of force 
against iraq after jan 15 if a pullout does not occur 
an estimated 900 americans and 1300 britons are among the more 
than 3000 westerners still in iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait 
iraqi officials said the foreigners could begin leaving saturday 
nearly 250 soviets freed from iraq arrived aboard an aeroflot 
jetliner in moscow today soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly 
churkin welcomed the release and saddams promise thursday 
the decision helps eliminate one of the burning issues that 
arose as a result of the gulf conflict churkin said but he 
hoped the iraqi leadership will take futher steps toward the 
implementation of all provisions of the un security councils 
resolutions 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir speaking in london said 
iraq should not be rewarded for releasing hostages 
the taking of hostages was an outrageous act of a dictatorial 
power and now he saddam is maybe going to release them and he 
wants to be paid for it shamir told bbc radio 
in oslo norwegian foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg said 
the release is an acknowledgement that taking of hostages does 
not aid the solving of conflicts 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati speaking in paris 
welcomed the release of hostages and said iran is still opposed to 
the presence of foreign troops in the region 
we think that the security of the region should be assured by 
the countries of the region 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat speaking 
in tunis said iraqs courageous decision will create a favorable 
atmosphere to a peaceful and political solution to the gulf 
crisis 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu said he hoped saddams 
move was a first step toward a peaceful resolution of the crisis 
but the london newspaper the daily telegraph commented today 
the tone of his saddams remarks gave little cause for hope 
that the likelihood of military action had significantly receded 
some military analysts said a decision to attack iraqi forces 
would be made easier with all the foreigners out of iraq 
michael dewar deputy director of the londonbased international 
institute for strategic studies was quoted by the daily telegraph 
as saying it allows airmen to strike iraqi targets with a 
totally clear conscience 
some of the foreign hostages had been held as human shields 
at strategic sites in iraq and kuwait in order to deter any attack 
by the usled multinational force in the gulf 
in baghdad as news spread of saddams announcement the mood 
turned to elation among the hostages and some family members who 
had come to the iraqi capital to plead for their loved ones 
release 
i feel delirious that i can leave said david farington a 
british worker trapped in iraq

japanese officials today denied accusations by a 
senior us energy department official that japan has been hoarding 
crude oil in defiance of an agreement among major consuming nations 
to draw down stockpiles 
this is a complete misunderstanding a senior government 
official said we are not stockpiling 
linda stuntz a us energy department under secretary for 
policy and planning told reporters in washington that in the 
months following iraqs invasion of kuwait japan increased imports 
to meet additional demand instead of drawing down stocks 
she noted that japan imported 33 percent more oil in october 
than it did in july and said such actions raised doubts about 
future cooperative activities among consuming nations in response 
to oil supply shocks 
the united states and other consumer nations have sought to ease 
the immediate shock of losing 43 million barrels of oil a day as a 
result of the iraqi invasion by minimizing imports stockpiling oil 
would contradict such efforts and would put upward pressure on oil 
prices 
officials in japans foreign ministry and the ministry of 
international trade and industry said that instead of increasing 
stocks as planned japanese oil companies had actually drawn down 
stocks 
increased imports however were needed during cool winter 
months to compensate for higher demand for heating fuel 
the amount of oil imported by japan fluctuates by 20 to 30 
percent every month depending on seasonal factors every year its 
exactly the same pattern said the government official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
stuntzs charge that japan was betraying other oil consuming 
nations by not drawing down its 142day emergency supply 
disregarded the fact that the united states is the only country 
that has tried to rely on existing stocks officials said 
no other country has drawn from its emergency stock and 
theres no reason why japan should the government official said 
i cant imagine why shes saying that its a complete 
mistake he said since august our stocks have been kept at a 
142day supply 
in fact the level of the stockpile increased slightly between 
june and october the most recent month for which statistics are 
available but the growth from a total of 337 million kiloliters 
to 339 million kiloliters or about onethird of japans daily 
consumption isnt considered significant 
japan also has increased crude oil imports to a certain extent 
to compensate for shortfalls in supplies of refined oil products 
due to the loss of kuwaits refining system industry sources 
noted 
weve brought in more oil but less product said naoki 
kuroda director general of the international trade and industry 
ministrys petroleum department 
japan imports nearly all the oil it uses and 70 percent of its 
oil imports come from the middle east

arizona gov rose mofford defended sen dennis 
deconcini before the senate ethics committee today describing him 
as a tireless worker for constituents who tried to help an 
important employer in his state 
mofford testified as a character witness in the ethics panels 
hearings into the socalled keating five senators 
the democratic governor said she had known deconcini since he 
was a 10yearold church altar boy as a threeterm senator she 
said he has built a reputation for getting things done for 
constitutents with problems 
dennis better than any official i know works at making the 
system work for constituents she said 
many people in arizona id say tens of thousands of people 
with problems in government theyd say call dennis she said 
mofford testified for less than 20 minutes and the ethics panel 
adjourned its hearings for the weekend following her appearance 
deconcini and the other senators face allegations they 
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of charles h 
keating jr an arizona businessman with a savings and loan based 
in california keating donated some 13 million to the campaigns 
and poltical causes of the five 
mofford said that at the time deconcini helped keating keating 
was running a large business that was an important employer in the 
state 
he was considered a very successful businessman and very 
charitable she said of keating his business she said seemed 
to be a secure investment 
on thursday william k black ended two days as a witness 
standing firmly by his allegations of political pressure by the 
socalled keating five senators in the face of skeptical 
questioning from members of the panel 
black said he and three other regulators in a meeting with the 
senators used definitive statements to describe practices at 
keatings lincoln savings and loan he said the lawmakers were told 
the irvine calif thrift had made massive loans without credit 
checks was flying blind had incompetent management and 
was courting failure 
but he said the senators would not accept their warning that 
lincoln was an institution they should avoid 
they were listening and were coming back with defense after 
defense after defense of lincoln despite us laying out in starkest 
terms exactly what was wrong black said in response to 
questions by sen jesse helms rnc 
it didnt impress them black said 
after a twohour closed session thursday the committee 
disclosed a new schedule that could prolong the hearings into 
january 
the panel plans to offer limited use immunity to compel the 
testimony of keatings former lobbyist and top aide james grogan 
committee vice chairman warren rudman rnh said grogan would 
produce documents in private next wednesday and would undergo 
questioning in closed session on dec 17 
the senators under scrutiny could begin testifying the next day 
but delays could push that after christmas or into january 
besides deconcini the senators under investigation are arizona 
republican john mccain and democrats john glenn of ohio alan 
cranston of california and donald riegle of michigan 
under crossexamination by attorneys for the five senators 
black blamed the lawmakers pressure for the federal home loan bank 
boards decision in 1988 to take san franciscobased regulators off 
the examination of lincoln the exam would have disclosed phony 
transactions and a taxsharing scam that sent false profits to 
lincolns parent company he said 
this is the most likely explanation for this completely 
unprecedented and grossly improper action of halting the 
examination that would have blown all of these thing so wide 
open said black allawyer with the bank board 
black was questioned by members of the panel about an earlier 
meeting he and the san franciscobased regulators held with the 
senators on april 9 1987 he testified the regulators said in 
effect this is not the place you want to touch not with a 
10foot pole not with a 20foot pole 
he said that by the end of the meeting riegle had gotten the 
message but that cranston and deconcini appeared not to have 
both later made contacts with regulators on behalf of keatings 
effort to avoid some regulatory controls and eventually to sell his 
thrift rather than have it taken over by the federal government 
sen howell heflin dala the ethics committee chairman 
questioned black about notes he took of the meeting he suggested 
that the regulators references that lincolns problems could be 
worked out could be viewed as an invitation to negotiate 
were talking about improper conduct heflin said and one 
of the things about improper conduct is the senators should not go 
in and try to negotiate with you and then it appears to me the 
regulators originate that 
after similar skeptical questioning by helms and sens david 
pryor dark and terry sanford dnc another member of the 
panel offered support for black 
sen trent lott rmiss told black he had been an impressive 
witness adding youre obviously very capable and i have been 
greatly influenced by what you had to say

polands first popular presidential 
campaign officially ended today with lech walesa sitting on a big 
lead in the polls and his challenger looking for votes among 
walesas rivals 
the freewheeling foray into democracy by law had to close at 
noon allowing voters a day and a half to make up their minds 
businessman stanislaw tyminski who had threatened to reveal 
compromising documents about walesa refused any such disclosures 
at a thursday night news conference despite hammering questions by 
polish and western journalists 
he said he would reveal what he had only at a rally today in the 
baltic port of szczecin among friends however no such 
disclosure occurred 
as he did thursday night tyminski opened the nowinfamous black 
briefcase in which he has said he carries the materials and pulled 
out a copy of a western news magazine interview with walesa 
solidaritys chairman he said 
i cannot show all the documents because it would be harmful 
for our country i have got more this magazine interview is the 
most important document our countrys future depends on it 
walesa has denied that any such documents could exist while 
demanding that tyminski make known anything he claims to have in 
the magazine interview he warns civil unrest possibly including a 
coup would likely develop when tyminski was unable to fulfill his 
promises for speedy economic improvement 
tyminski who defeated prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki in the 
first round of voting also said he would not leave the country 
regardless of the outcome of the election and that the 1981 
communist martiallaw repression of solidarity was necessary 
also today polands powerful roman catholic primate jozef glemp 
said after meeting with polishborn pope john paul ii in rome 
the polish church will side with walesa this is not a 
political decision but a decision based on the certainty of being 
in the best interests of the common good for the whole country 
polls open at 6 am sunday and close at 8 pm for the 
countrys 27 million eligible voters exit surveys by state 
television in partnership with the german polling service infas are 
expected to give reliable projections within minutes after voting 
stops full unofficial returns are expected monday 
tyminski duplicating his first election round pattern of 
campaigning to the last minute attended a 10 am rally in 
szczecin the formerly german city in extreme northwest poland 325 
miles from warsaw 
the emigre tyminski was greeted by chants of lech walesa 
and back to peru when he arrived at the rally attended by 
4000 to 5000 people in a sports hall supporters applause was 
mixed with boos and whistles from the several hundred walesa fans 
present 
tarzan from peru for president of the polish peoples 
republic said one tongueincheek banner carried by the walesa 
camp referring to the former communist name for poland 
outside the arena some young people dressed up in 
pseudoperuvian style collected donations for the protection 
of sacred dogs the pap news agency said it was a spoof of 
sacred dogs tyminskis selfpublished book of political and 
economic philosophy cowritten with a longtime communist party 
journalist 
polls released as the campaign ended gave walesa commanding 
majorities the last state television poll conducted monday and 
tuesday said walesa had a 73 percent to 16 percent advantage 
two other polls put the margin at 58 percent to 23 percent and 
61 percent to 20 percent 
pollsters advised however that the surveys be treated 
cautiously because they felt many were reluctant to admit even in 
an anonymous poll that they support tyminski

security council ambassadors today awaited 
a us reply on a draft resolution approving of a peace conference 
on the palestinian problem iraqs key demand for solving the 
kuwait crisis 
american officials said us ambassador thomas r pickering was 
still consulting with other ambassadors and with washington this 
morning 
the timing of the introduction of the resolution after meetings 
among un ambassadors thursday promised to complicate 
usisraeli relations 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir flying to the united 
states today to start an american tour said in london that 
israel will not agree to any foreign body deciding its future and 
fate 
precisely because of our consistent position that we will not 
link the gulf crisis and the arabisraeli dispute this is 
certainly not an appropriate time for an international 
conference secretary of state james a baker iii said 
the united states will not give iraqi president saddam hussein 
some facesaving way out of something he shouldnt have gotten 
into in the first place bush told reporters in chile 
the council was supposed to meet late this morning but 
postponed the meeting until the afternoon with no explanation 
there was no assurance that the meeting would actually be held 
later 
the draft resolution was approved in principle wednesday by the 
permanent five security council members the united states soviet 
union britain france and china 
but president bushs spokesman said washington was making 
changes in the language of the resolution us officials said the 
changes did not alter the basic thrust of the draft 
were trying to work out language that is acceptable that 
meets our policy obviously the un wants to speak to this 
issue said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in santiago 
chile 
in baghdad the parliament today approved saddams request to 
free all foreign hostages his request made on thursday came just 
hours after the text of the draft resolution was widely reported 
but it was not clear he was aware of it 
baghdad wants to send all the hostages home by christmas iraqs 
un ambassador said thursday 
definitely we would like to see everyone with his family by 
christmas because that is a very joyous and happy occasion and it 
is time for family reunions said ambassador abdul amir 
alanbari 
the release of hostages has been a main demand of the security 
council which has passed 12 resolutions condemning iraqs invasion 
of kuwait and authorizing economic sanctions and force to end the 
occupation 
the working paper agreed to wednesday by the permanent 
security council members considers that the convening at an 
appropriate time of an international peace conference on the middle 
east 
the paper says talks that are properly structured with the 
participation of the parties concerned would facilitate the 
achievement of a comprehensive settlement and lasting peace in the 
middle east 
the problem of a homeland for the palestinians would be central 
to any such peace settlement 
but the text contains numerous loopholes that would allow israel 
to delay or abort the process the clause requiring the 
participation of the parties concerned gives israel virtual veto 
power over the conference 
saddam proposed on aug 12 10 days after his troops conquered 
kuwait that he would link a solution of the palestinian homeland 
question to any withdrawal of his army from the emirate

dozens of people in southern michigan kentucky 
and ohio say they saw a bright green and blue light flash across 
the sky this morning before the thing possibly a meteor seemed to 
explode 
whatever it is it could have been 200 miles south of us but 
it was huge mike dennis of rockford north of grand rapids told 
wcuz radio after spotting the light about 545 am est ive 
never seen anything like it 
dennis dixon a meteorologist at the national weather service in 
ann arbor said there were no reports of meteor showers or other 
activity that could account for the sightings he said the weather 
service was unaware of the incident 
but maj thomas niemann a spokesman at the us space command 
in colorado springs colo said the agency believes the object was 
of otherthanearth origin 
he said the center tracks about 6700 satellites none of which 
was responsible for the flash he said it probably was a meteor 
its been our experience that when you get that color its of 
otherthanearth origin he said thats what astronomers 
around the country have told me 
william spencer of southfield a detroit suburb said he saw the 
light on his way to work in wayne countys plymouth township 
it was a big bluishgreen ball of light and it had a train of 
yellow sparks behind it i thought it was a helicopter it was 
moving fast 
it was coming down at a high rate of speed then it just 
disappeared i thought it had crashed 
in ohio the flash was reported by callers from cincinnati to 
toledo reports also were received in louisville ky 
officials at nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt 
md and the us naval observatory in washington said they had no 
information about satellites or other manmade space objects 
crashing to earth

when the chicago bears had to look elsewhere 
because neal anderson couldnt gain ground up the middle last week 
they didnt turn away from their star halfback 
instead anderson showed how important he is to the bears 
offense by lining up as a wide receiver and catching a 50yard 
touchdown pass that beat the detroit lions in overtime 
he doesnt get the attention some other backs receive but 
anderson has quietly become the star of chicagos offense as 
important to his 102 team as walter payton and gale sayers were to 
the bear teams of the past 
as far as complete backs go i think i have to be ranked at 
the top anderson said this week as the bears prepared to play 
the washington redskins 75 sunday at rfk stadium 
the game is more important to the redskins who are in the thick 
of the nfcs wildcard race chicago has already clinched the nfc 
central division title and is playing for the home field advantage 
in the playoffs 
i hope everybodys professional and knows weve still got to 
go out and play said anderson who is 34 yards short of 4000 
yards rushing for his career nobody feels like were going to 
ease up there are a lot of things still on the line 
anderson in his fifth year in the nfl hasnt eased up yet this 
season 
he is second in the nfl with 1298 total yards from scrimmage 
leading a rushing attack that has gained a leaguebest 1972 yards 
and is one of the chief reasons chicago has rebounded last seasons 
610 mediocrity 
the bears are averaging 1643 yards a game rushing well above 
the league average of 1127 while other ground games are 
faltering chicago is the only team to have more yards rushing than 
passing 
in these days of runandshoot offenses the bears hand the ball 
off 37 times a game control the ball for more than 34 minutes a 
game and pound out wins in what coach mike ditka calls a blue 
collar way 
the redskins have had trouble against the run all year at least 
until they held miami to 34 yards rushing in a 4220 victory last 
week 
holding anderson to 27 yards on 13 carries was key to the 
redskins 3814 win over the bears last year 
chicago pounds at you until they hit a big play said coach 
joe gibbs if you cant stop the run its going to be a long 
day 
anderson has been just about the whole story of the bears 
offense he is second to fullback brad muster with 37 receptions 
and leads the team with 445 yards receiving 
second to detroits barry sanders with 853 yards rushing on 216 
carries he is 147 yards short of his third straight 1000yard 
year on the ground he is fourth on the bears alltime rushing list 
and 14th on their alltime receiving list 
when the going got tough against detroit last week it was 
anderson who shouted on the sidelines in overtime that he could get 
open from a wide receivers slot 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know we like to run 
said anderson teams have stacked things up trying to stop the 
run but we expect to get our yards teams are putting eight men on 
the line but were spreading things out 
there were doubts around the league that anderson could carry 
the load as the successor to the legendary payton in the chicago 
backfield 
he was a firstround draft choice after setting collegiate 
records at florida since broken by cowboy emmitt smith but he 
was the nexttolast pick in the first round 
other backs went before him and younger players like smith and 
sanders get more press 
i feel fortunate to have come here he said i have other 
friends who have been in losing situations and thats not fun 
i just go out and play like neal anderson can play the guys 
in this organization know what i can do they made me the highest 
paid running back in the league in the offseason so im content 
where i am he said

the group plans to select a new leader this weekend clarence 
makwetu the acting president is considered the favorite 
in his opening address makwetu said reforms by de klerks 
government were of no consequence 
they are merely intending to reform apartheid makwetu said

a man imprisoned since 1984 for kidnapping 
and sexually assaulting a 3yearold girl and then leaving her for 
dead in an outhouse pit was released from prison today 
robert thiret whose release gov roy romer tried in vain to 
block did not speak as he and his attorney emerged from the 
facility and got into a van his destination was not known 
colorado law requires thiret to be set free no parole no 
probation no restrictions even though authorities have said they 
still consider him a menace and psychologists say hes made 
minimal progress in therapy 
thiret 28 was convicted of snatching a 3yearold girl in 
sheridan in 1983 she was found alive three days later in an 
outhouse pit at a campground 20 miles west of denver near genesee 
she had been sexually assaulted and left for dead 
thiret has been at the jefferson county sheriffs complex where 
he was serving a sixmonth sentence for telephone harassment after 
getting out of the state penitentiary where he served six years of 
a 10year sentence for attempted murder and sexual assault on a 
child 
onlookers who had shown up at the jail to watch thirets release 
were urged to leave by sheriffs officials 
news of thirets impending release had angered residents and led 
romer to criticize state parole law 
thiret was up for parole in 1989 but public pressure pushed 
authorities to continue to hold him in may the colorado supreme 
court ruled that because of the delay under the law in effect at 
the time of the attack thiret had to be freed not paroled 
on june 23 thiret was transferred from state prison to the 
jefferson county jail to serve the harassment sentence 
stephen bakker a rescue volunteer who carried thirets 
shivering victim from the outhouse pit questioned why he should be 
released from jail 
i just dont believe anybody who could do something like that 
to a little girl is going to change just by being in jail bakker 
said 
bakker said he still can see the 3yearold girl wearing only 
her underwear shivering in the outhouse pit where she had been 
left for dead 
i dont see how anybody could do that to a child just 
leaving her in a pit like that he said she was disoriented 
she was just looking for something warm to hold onto as soon as i 
touched her she grabbed me and held on until i pulled her out 
the girl recovered

american hostages raised beer mugs to toast 
their impending freedom today after parliament overwhelmingly 
approved saddam husseins decision to free all foreigners trapped 
by the persian gulf crisis 
the 250member national assembly which has no record of ever 
defying saddam passed the measure with a vote of 23218 reporters 
said 
it freed more than 8000 westerners east europeans and japanese 
stranded by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait officials said 
foreigners would be allowed to begin leaving as early as saturday 
in washington state department officials said they have asked 
iraq to waive the exit visas but hadnt heard a response 
the officials say they are also awaiting answers from baghdad 
regarding other departure arrangements for the americans 
contingency plans have been made to charter airplanes but no 
schedule has yet been made 
at the downtown mansourmelia hotel which has become known as 
hostage central 50 american and british hostages hugged and kissed 
each other and clinked their beer mugs together to celebrate their 
impending release 
this is it were all free one hostage shouted when a 
reporter told him of the parliament vote 
in the past hostages have been gathered at the mansourmelia 
hotel before transportation to strategic sites to serve as human 
shields it is also where they have been taken to meet visiting 
relatives 
about 600 americans britons and japanese have been held at 
strategic sites to deter attack by the 350000strong usled 
multinational forces arrayed against iraq in the persian gulf to 
force baghdad from kuwait 
it is a monumental occasion said robert vinton a 
businessman from santa fe nm he was taken to the hotel wednesday 
to see his wife sue she had flown in with several american and 
british women to appeal for the release of their husbands sons and 
fathers 
vinton 58 said he was picked up in kuwait and taken to a 
military installation 20 miles south of baghdad he said he and 
other hostages there were treated as well as may be expected 
ronald ginn 49 a computer consultant from seattle who had been 
living in kuwait before the invasion said my main complaint was 
the loss of freedom he said he had been held at two 
communications centers in baghdad ginn said his house in kuwait 
was stripped clean after the invasion and estimated he had lost 
80000 worth of property 
an estimated 2000 foreigners remain in hiding in kuwait for 
fear of detention as human shields at potential targets 
the national assembly decision meant the foreigners could apply 
for exit permits a process that could take several days to 
complete iraqi officials said however the evacuation might begin 
as early as saturday indicating authorities planned to speed up 
the procedure 
if they waive the exit visa requirement i guarantee well 
get them out as fast as we possibly can us charge daffaires 
joseph wilson said after the parliament vote 
officials said flights would be added to the daily iraqi airways 
trip to amman jordan the airlines only regular destination since 
the united nations imposed economic sanctions on iraq because of 
the invasion 
countries wishing to send special flights to baghdad to retrieve 
their nationals must first get clearance from the un sanctions 
committee the officials said 
a british airways jet stocked with champagne left london for the 
middle east today to pick up hostages planes were also being 
prepared in denmark and japan dutch officials said they expected 
to send a flight next week 
in london a spokesman for british airways said the plane had 
left for baghdad but was awaiting approval to land from the un 
sanctions committee and iraqi officials without approval the plane 
would be diverted to amman 
in new york iraqs un ambassador abdul amir alanbari said 
baghdad wants all the hostages it has been holding to be home by 
christmas 
the iraqi ambassador said it might speed the release of 
detainees if the united states sent planes to jordan to pick them 
up 
it is a matter of logistical things he said 
saddam on thursday urged parliament to end the travel ban on 
foreigners in a letter to assembly speaker saleh 
saddam said their internment was meant to delay war and give 
the iraqi troops occupying kuwait time to complete mobilization 
now that they have done so saddam said there was no longer any 
need for the hostages 
he also noted that recent diplomatic overtures indicated 
positive changes in the international standoff against iraq 
and said the release of hostages would encourage such trends 
in all there are 2 million foreigners in iraq and occupied 
kuwait asians and arabs who make up the majority of the foreigners 
who were free to leave 
meanwhile nearly 250 soviets freed from iraq arrived aboard an 
aeroflot jetliner in moscow today iraq freed soviet nationals 
after the kremlin indicated it might use force against iraq if its 
citizens were harmed

columbias astronauts were back 
stargazing today after scientists on the ground fired up the 150 
million astro observatory which has been crippled by repeated 
malfunctions 
while two astronomers aboard the shuttle helped ground teams 
guide the telescopes two other crew members conducted a live 
science lesson this morning for middle school students at two nasa 
centers 
you may have heard of some of the problems weve been 
having astronaut jeffrey hoffman told the youngsters its 
been quite an interesting and dynamic mission 
troubles have persisted throughout the mission and have forced 
the astronauts to skip more than 100 planned observations about 
250 celestial targets were to have been studied 
the latest problem occurred thursday when a backup computer 
terminal aboard the spacecraft that had been running the 
observatorys three ultraviolet telescopes overheated and shut 
down the other computer terminal failed sunday 
lint which can accumulate from such items as astronauts 
clothing paper products and hand towels on the shuttle was found 
clogging the air vents of the first failed terminal flight 
director gary coen said he said the second terminal hadnt been 
fully inspected yet 
coen said the cause of the computer failures has not been 
determined and he didnt know if it was connected to the lint 
buildup 
despite the setbacks the crew proceeded with todays lesson 
the first in what nasa hopes will become a regular science series 
for youngsters 
hoffman and sam durrance before starting 12 hours of 
observation work talked to the students for more than a halfhour 
about star formation and the many different kinds of radiation 
emitted from celestial objects 
to mark his debut as a teacher hoffman wore a dress shirt and 
tie the first tie ever worn in space as far as i know he 
said 
i can tell you it works quite well you have to be a little 
careful in zero gravity as you can see hoffman said pushing 
down his floating tie 
the other astronomers on the sevenman crew robert parker and 
ron parise answered questions from the students later in the 
morning at the end of their work shift parise in response to an 
alabama boys query said it has been quite tedious and 
timeconsuming trying to operate the observatory 
twelve students were at marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala and 29 were at goddard space flight center in 
greenbelt md other students were able to watch the presentations 
in their classrooms via cable television services 
meanwhile the astro observatory is being run by commands sent 
from the ground that guide the telescopes toward their desired 
targets the astronauts using a joystick and aided by information 
from the ground can then zero in on an object 
the process succeeded several times thursday night and early 
today giving scientists hope that many more observations can be 
made before columbias 10day flight ends tuesday 
our attitude here is that weve got a mode we feel is going to 
work and were going to go get the science mission manager jack 
jones said but he added he didnt know yet how efficient the 
operation would be 
spacelab mission operations controls john david bartoe 
congratulated the astronauts this morning for obtaining 
fantastic observations of a quasar one of the most distant 
objects in the universe all three ultraviolet telescopes focused 
on the quasar for 51 minutes three minutes longer than planned 
thats what happens when you have good oldfashioned 
astronomy and a little bit of help from your friends parker 
told bartoe 
a total of 187 observations were planned between late sunday and 
thursday morning but only 70 were completed because of the 
computer malfunctions and other problems said nasa spokeswoman 
cindy sanderson 
earlier this week the astronauts missed precious viewing time 
because of trouble with the observatorys instrumentpointing 
system which guides the three ultraviolet telescopes the four 
astronomers on the flight often had to resort to manually guiding 
the telescopes 
the observatorys xray telescope which is operated by computer 
commands sent from goddard space flight center was unaffected 
because it has its own pointing system 
moments before the backup computer terminal shut down thursday 
the crew smelled a burning odor similar to one that filled the 
cabin sunday when the other terminal shut down 
nasa tried to restart the first terminal after the lint was 
vacuumed from its filters but the smell reappeared and hoffman 
quickly shut it down 
controllers have not decided whether to try to restart the 
second terminal coen said 
the problems were the latest for the mission which had been 
delayed for six months this year because of shuttle fuel leaks and 
other telescope problems the mission had originally been scheduled 
for 1986 but was postponed after the challenger accident

environmentalists are facing their annual 
christmas quandary reusable plastic or recyclable wood 
the artificial christmas tree represents a bit of a dilemma 
for green consumers said joel makower publisher of the monthly 
green consumer letter it seems phony and far from ecological 
but it is a reusable thing and eliminates cutting a tree and 
sending it to a landfill 
some people of course have no doubts about which tree to 
choose 
a real tree equals a real christmas said jeanne weiss 
spokeswoman for the national christmas tree association in 
milwaukee wis 
real trees are recyclable theyre a renewable resource and 
biodegradable whereas fake trees are generally made out of 
petroleum byproducts and metal she said 
christmas trees are farmed on about a million of acres of land 
in all 50 states taking seven to 15 years to grow to suitable 
height the association said seedlings are planted to replace each 
years harvest of about 36 million trees very few of which come 
from wild forests any more 
personally i wish people would buy more plastic trees because 
thats what i sell says meyer stopol vice president of new 
yorks james a cole inc a major importer of artificial christmas 
trees nearly all of which come from the far east 
people today decorate much earlier at home by the time 
christmas comes the real trees dried out he said adding 
that the trees are put out as garbage after the holiday 
artificial trees stopol says can last for many years 
the truly committed may opt for a living potted christmas tree 
plantable outdoors after the tinsel comes down 
but that can be a lot of trouble especially in parts of country 
where the ground may freeze by late december 
something like that takes planning ms weiss said in 
some areas its not a viable option 
makower suggested hat a living indoor holiday tree need not 
resemble a towering forest pine 
theres no question that having a live christmas tree is the 
greenest thing to do he said a small potted plant will do 
but not everyone will be ready to settle for trimming the 
schefflera or hanging spider plant 
environmentalists say the most important thing is making sure 
the tree doesnt just go into the trash after the holidays 
pine needles are good conditioners for some soils the trunks 
can be cut up for garden stakes or shredded for mulch and more and 
more nurseries and county parks departments are eager to accept 
dead christmas trees to get the mulch 
the ikea home furnishing chain which has six stores mostly on 
the east coast is even willing to lease a christmas tree for 20 
mark wells operation manager for ikeas outlet in dale city 
va said customers who bring back their tree on the first or 
second saturday in january will get either a 10 refund plus their 
own mulch or 20 toward a 100 purchase if they leave the mulch 
for ikea to donate to the local parks department 
we lose money on the deal he said but were proud that 
we try to do something to help the environment 
makower said no one should think one tree a year is too small a

you know how to whistle dont you just put a 
domeshaped skyscraper together and let the wind blow 
case in point the 72story cityspire wind whipping around the 
louvered top of the building 800 feet above the street emits a 
highpitched wail that echoes for blocks through manhattans 
concrete canyons city officials said friday 
from third avenue down to the 40s up to the 60s over on the 
west side the calls have come from all over said ian matthews 
of the city department of environmental conservation 
the callers said basically theres a noise and its driving 
me batty and i dont know where its coming from 
on wednesday department investigators solved that last problem 
after more than a month of searching they zeroed in on the 
cityspire at seventh avenue amd west 56th street went up to the 
roof and found the eightsided dome was wailing away 
a summons was issued for violating the city noise control code 
if the building is found guilty a fine of 220 to 880 can be 
imposed 
with the right winds it becomes a big whistle said 
matthews i dont know the acoustics but its a very loud very 
big whistle and if you lived in the neighborhood it could drive 
you insane 
just ask anthony mazzola editor in chief of harpers bazaar who 
lives two blocks from the building the siren call sent him 
scurrying around the neighborhood desperate to find its source 
ive been all over the street trying to find the noise said 
mazzola you think youre in a loony bin you cant get away from 
it 
mazzola was not alone the department received hundreds of 
complaints durring the past five weeks about the aggravating 
reverberation matthews said 
this was news to the buildings developer and its architect who 
knew nothing of the alleged noise pollution 
when somebody calls and says your buildings whistling i 
mean hey come on said howard hornstein the lawyer for 
building developer ian bruce eichner 
hornstein said his side is waiting for a copy of the complaint 
before responding although architect sam saccia of the 
architecture firm murphyjahn in chicago believes the whistling 
if it exists can be stopped 
the sound doesnt occur every day the wind must be coming in at 
the right speed the largest number of complaints occurred around 
veterans day when the wind gusted to 30 mph said matthews on 
wednesday gusts reached 23 mph reporters heard no buildings 
whistling on friday when the air was nearly calm 
its not the first time the cityspire has drawn unwanted 
attention when the building was completed it stood 814 feet tall 
11 feet above a cityimposed limit 
the ensuing controversy ended when developer eichner agreed to 
construct more than 7000 feet of dance space for nonprofit groups 
in his building hornstein is beginning to wonder if its all worth 
it 
the point is first we had the height issue now weve got the 
whistling building and ive been lawyering it through the whole 
thing said hornstein i mean really the city approved these 
plans

iraqs decision to release 
hostages is welcome news for us troops but they said friday the 
persian gulf crisis wont be settled until kuwait is freed and 
saddam hussein is stopped 
i think its all well and good but i dont think we should 
leave here until this thing is resolved said senior airman ken 
hardwick 23 of charleston sc 
its not about hostages its about kuwait if we dont get 
kuwait back then this guys going to have the power to run over 
other countries weve got to stop him before he goes any 
further hardwick said 
any progress toward a negotiated settlement is cheered by the 
troops who were first ordered to the saudi arabian desert four 
months ago by president bush but they noted that the hostage issue 
was only one of the conditions bush set to resolve the crisis 
i think the hostages were a bad side effect of this whole 
thing said 1st lt brian ratchford 26 of spartenburg sc 
and a member of the 39th tactical air squadron 
i dont want to go to war but if we have to i think its 
better than the alternative of letting saddam develop his nuclear 
weapons capabilities which i see as the ultimate evil he said 
most troops are suspicious of saddams motive and timing 
especially since he once referred to hostages as guests and 
deployed them around military targets as human shields 
is it a signal that he is caving in or is it that hes trying 
to buy additional time to get support from someone else asked 
1st sgt jerry carlton 37 of warsaw nc and a member of the 
armys 82nd airborne division 
however carlton added i think its a good gesture at 
christmas time to give some hopes for all the troops and the 
families back home that we may be able to get back home 
other members of the 82nd airborne the first ground troops to 
arrive in saudi arabia also distrusted the announcement 
the majority of the people think its a ploy to stall for 
time said spec mark mattson 30 of port huron mich we need 
to play some hardball if you dont knock him down hes going to 
be even stronger 
soldiers who came here primed for battle have ridden a roller 
coaster of shifting emotions while diplomats have tried to settle 
the crisis with talk instead of bullets 
if we can get the mission done without firing a shot great 
well pack up hell move out and well go home plain as that 
said army sgt anthony sikora 24 of chester pa 
and air force staff sgt chester smolarczyk 28 of 
jacksonville ark said hes willing to wait a while longer for 
diplomacy even if the hostage release is just a stalling tactic 
which is cheaper blood or oil asked smolarczyk

sponsors of a international womens forum 
study which concluded that female managers lead differently than 
men denied on friday charges that the report contributed to sexual 
stereotypes 
the study said that women manage to a greater extent than men 
by personal interaction with their subordinates it says men are 
more likely to manage on a more authoritarian 
rewardandpunishment system 
we are not blaming them we are not saying its better or 
worse we are just saying its different judy b rosener a 
professor in the graduate school of management at the university of 
california in irvine said at a news conference 
we dont want an interactive leader in saudi arabia at the 
moment said ms rosener the author of the report i would 
think we want a command and control type 
cynthia maduro ryan a washington lawyer and former corporate 
executive who is president of the iwf said we are not here in any 
way to discredit the command and control or authoritarian style 
it was basically appropriate and well done for purposes of the 
industrial era she said we are going through rapid changes in 
the information age and a period of adjustment women are not 
having to unlearn the other style because they never adapted to it 
in the beginning 
the international womens forum is an organization of prominent 
women leaders in 16 countries including astronaut sally ride 
former british prime minister margaret thatcher and supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor 
ms rosener said she has received about a hundred telephone 
calls about the study since her article on its findings appeared in 
the novemberdecember issue of the harvard business review 
people are saying gender has nothing to do with it you are 
really enforcing gender stereotypes she said 
but she said we are not saying that all women behave one way 
and all men behave another way 
the harvard business review will run a dozen or so letters on 
the subject many of them critical along with the authors 
response in its januaryfebruary issue ms rosener said 
the study was based on responses from 355 members of the forum 
and 101 men in similar positions 
it says the typical woman surveyed prefers the use of personal 
power that is power based on her charisma work record and 
contact as contrasted with structural power based on the authority 
that comes with organizational position title and the ability to 
reward and punish 
it says the women make the same amount of money as men in 
comparable positions but appear to lead differently than their 
male colleagues they are likely to be more transformational than 
their male peers 
most of them are married the report said 
the story the findings tell is that it is possible to combine 
family and career earn a substantial income and not act 
masculine in order to succeed the study said

the nations poorest states lost 32 billion 
in federal healthcare dollars for the needy in 1989 because of an 
outdated formula for distributing medicaid funds the general 
accounting office said friday 
the gao said the formula which bases payment on an average of 
per capita income should be eliminated because it fails to account 
for the actual number of people living in poverty in a state and 
the ability of that state to raise revenues 
the formula does not target most federal funds to states with 
the greatest needs those with weak tax bases and high 
concentrations of poor people gao researcher janet l shikles 
told the house government operations subcommittee on human 
resources and intergovernmental relations 
the hearing was called to investigate the growing strains on the 
federalstate program that is supposed to provide health care to 
the poor serving 26 million people this year 
perhaps the most significant weakness of per capita income as 
an indicator of a states ability to finance program benefits is 
that it does not reflect all the income states are potentially able 
to tax she said 
the federal government pays 55 percent of medical expenses under 
medicaid states pay the rest the gao said the combined 
expenditures totaled 61 billion in 1989 
shikles specifically mentioned taxable business earnings that 
dont get counted when calculating per capita income 
if poverty levels and taxable resources had been used in 
tandem with reducing the federal share to 40 percent nine states 
would have received more than 100 million in additional payments 
in 1989 shikles said 
states that would have benefited are arkansas california 
florida georgia kentucky mississippi new york tennessee and 
texas 
the 55 percent federal cap allows richer states to collect more 
than they need she said 
per capita income represents an average of income so a high 
percentage of wealthy individuals would raise the average even 
though large numbers of people live in poverty as in new york or 
california 
a dozen states mostly in the northeast and midwest each would 
have had payments reduced by more than 100 million she said 
those states are connecticut illinois indiana iowa maryland 
massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey ohio pennsylvania 
and wisconsin 
the overall difference would have been 32 billion according 
to gao estimates 
gao the government investigative agency first proposed 
eliminating the formula in 1983 since then congress has allowed 
use of the formula in the distribution of grants for mental health 
and substance abuse treatment programs 
the idea has been resurrected because of the crisis in medicaid 
funding brought on by the expansion of types of coverage required 
and soaring medical costs as well as the growing number of poor 
elderly and of children born into poverty 
fridays hearing focused on that crisis and included testimony 
from democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas 
clinton chairman of the national governors association task 
force on health care said after the hearing that he favors the 
change but could not speak for all 50 overnors 
theres no unified position they could take on that said 
alicia pelrine group director for human resources at the 
governorss association there isnt a state in the union that 
can afford to take less money and still do what theyre being asked 
to do 
clinton said congress has rapidly expanded the numbers of people 
eligible for coverage and raising their income limits replacing 
options with mandates the coverage of poor women and children and 
of nursing home residents are areas that have grown in the last 
four years he said 
i have no problems with the mandates but the practical impact 
has been to wreak havoc on a lot of state budgets he said 
he said medicaid is growing faster than any other state program 
rising from 10 percent of state budgets in 1985 to 14 percent in 
1990 its projected that portion will increase to 17 percent in 
1995 
sara rosenbaum of the childrens defense fund a childrens 
rights group said there are better measures but that the 
revised formula overlooks the varying costs of medical care from 
state to state should be considered 
massachusetts which would have received 437 million less under 
the gao formula has very expensive medical care 
attention she said should be focused on lapses of federal 
policy such as a lack of health insurance for more than 30 
million americans that push people into poverty

the united states will withdraw its diplomats 
from the beleaguered us embassy in kuwait once they finish 
helping all americans who wish to leave the country the state 
department said today 
the embassy will remain open but unstaffed said spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler the united states expects the iraqis to 
safeguard the premises once the americans leave she said 
despite iraqs order to shut down the embassy the united states 
had insisted on leaving it staffed partly as a symbolic gesture of 
defiance against the iraqi occupation of kuwait 
eight american diplomats have been virtual prisoners at the 
embassy in kuwait city since the end of august they have been 
subsisting on meager rations with their water and electricity cut 
off and prevented by iraqi troops from leaving the compound 
president bush expressed repeated anger at the treatment of the 
diplomats saying it violated all international norms of diplomatic 
behavior 
but tutwiler said that once all americans who wish to leave 
kuwait are allowed to do so the embassy will have fulfilled its 
major remaining task 
the diplomats main job was to keep in touch with the estimated 
300 americans still in kuwait some of them in hiding from iraqi 
troops 
since the united states doesnt recognize iraqi control of 
kuwait we are not going to be doing normal routine government 
business with iraqi occupation forces she said 
two british diplomats have also been holding out at their own 
embassy in kuwait 
the united nations security council adopted a resolution several 
weeks ago calling for the two embassies to be provided with food 
but the world body was unable to make arrangements for restocking 
the two missions 
iraqi president saddam hussein is allowing all foreigners to 
leave iraq and kuwait and the americans are expected to start 
leaving as early as saturday

senate republican leader bob dole said friday 
he will introduce a bill early next month to grant some tax relief 
for military personnel serving in the persian gulf area 
his bill would waive interest charges for failing to pay any 
taxes due by the april 15 deadline 
if soldiers cant be expected to obtain and complete all their 
necessary paperwork in a foreign desert they shouldnt be 
penalized by their government dole said 
the kansas senator made the announcement after the internal 
revenue service noted that any member of the armed services serving 
in the persian gulf on april 15 would automatically have an 
additional 60 days to file a return and pay any tax due 
however the agency said it had no authority to waive interest 
charges on taxes not paid by the filing deadline doles bill would 
provide that authority 
the irs said most of the military personnel like threequarters 
of all americans will be due refunds and would not face the 
prospect of paying interest

a 6miletall beam of turquoise light will stab 
the sky and laser images will cavort on fabric screens as a way 
for this city to project a hightech image and celebrate its 
downtown revival 
in a ceremony saturday night mayor paul johnson is scheduled to 
touch a console to publicly open a permanent laser show in patriots 
square park 
after the weekend festival ends anyone with 25 cents will be 
able to manipulate the beam or activate random selections from up 
to 150 computerdriven images 
the 21acre park is in the citys civic center near where a 
new highrise commercial block called the arizona center already is 
bringing new life downtown for the first time in years 
but it is the laser action that boosters see as the crown of 
downtown renewal 
what this evolved into said architect ted alexander the 
park and laser concepts creator was a very strong statement 
stylistically for phoenix a number 1 entrepreneurial hotbed this 
symbolizes phoenix as a hightech city that looks to the future 
the park caps a fivelevel underground parking garage a 
combined 154 million project that began in 1981 and officially 
opened in december 1988 
the laser portion delayed by city councils reluctance to 
provide financing cost 355000 half of it in donations and 
will take an estimated 40000 a year to keep up 
one laser can be moved to slice the sky from the vertical to the 
nearhorizontal though one highrise north of the park limits the 
effect in that direction 
the beam ranges in width from 3 to 5 feet visibility depends on 
the air particles of dust and moisture help reflect the light 
the other laser operation projects images on one of the five 
saillike triangular screens intermeshed with the parks 115foot 
central spire of steel rings and rods 
these images holiday messages representational shapes like 
ornaments submarines and spaceships and abstract designs can be 
made to zoom larger or smaller stretch or fatten spin and tumble 
and flicker 
alexander and former mayor terry goddard say the laser show can 
come to symbolize phoenix a desert city of sometimes searing heat 
that has as its logo the fable fire bird rising from ashes 
it can be our own version of the arch in st louis or the 
space needle in seattle said goddard the democratic candidate 
in arizonas stillcontested gubernatorial election 
like alexander eiffels tower in paris the parks spire debuted 
to critics sneers one called the park a boil that needs to be 
lanced even goddard suggested the evolving park looked like a 
landing pad for ufos 
were trying to create a symbol here that reflects phoenixs 
growth alexander said during the earlier stages and anytime 
you make a bold statement for a community theres no way to please 
everybody 
alexander spent six months studying what makes urban spaces work 
before he began his redesign of what was a grassy area crisscrossed 
by concrete walkways with a fountain where transients bathed 
the new park has about 160 trees lighted low columns of glass 
bricks and curving rosebrick planters and walls every horizontal 
surface is designed for sitting making the park popular for office 
workers lunches at its heart is a 45foothigh dome shading an 
800seat amphitheater 
the park was designed to delight the spirit alexander 
said 
at night the glassbrick columns and white globes atop twisted 
lamp poles add illumination to the glow of colored lights and the 
sparkle of fountains 
the argon lasers though powerful beams of light wont slice 
the wings off planes skewer people or punch holes in nearby 
buildings alexander says 
the beams are computercontrolled to stay above the skyline but 
even if a beam dipped out of control it would do no more than cast 
shadows officials say 
the heat dissipates very quickly as a function of distance 
alexander said youd have a real hard time lighting a cigarette 
at 10 feet 
and the beam will be shut off by a technician if a plane flies 
within 500 to 1000 feet he added 
it will not shine into peoples homes nor will it light up 
the night sky and interfere with astronomers alexander said 
it reflects phoenix ready for the 21st century

the keating five hearings are supposed to be 
focused on ethics not cigars so why was senate ethics committee 
chairman howell heflin holding up that fourpack of cheap stogies 
heflin dala was simply comparing his cheap cigars to the 
9145 cigar bill on the tab at a dinner attended by former chief 
savings and loan regulator edwin j gray 
the cigar issue was raised by william taylor iii attorney for 
sen alan cranston dcalif he was demonstrating that gray and 
other regulators were wined and dined with thrift industry money 
one dinner bill for gray and others totaled 115863 including 
the amount for cigars 
committee special counsel robert s bennett piped up that 
chairman heflin also liked good cigars heflin responded by showing 
everyone his lowly smokes 
 
an insight into big thinking in fund raising was provided at one 
point by cranston one of the five senators whose conduct in 
connection with major contributor charles h keating jr the 
former savings and loan owner is being investigated the other 
four senators are dennis deconcini dariz donald w riegle jr 
dmich john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz 
in a written deposition released by the committee cranston 
said 
many people trying to raise money can never bring themselves 
to ask for really large amounts yet for those you are soliciting 
its a compliment a compliment to ask someone for a large sum if 
theyre capable of giving big and you ask small some potential 
donors will be insulted 
referring to keating cranston said you know hes given 
lavishly to others you dont ask a guy like him for peanuts and 
you ask frequently 
however at another point cranston lamented personally and 
politically i wish to god id never heard of charles keating 
 
several references have been made to keatings contributions to 
the famous advocate for the poor mother teresa 
the latest mention came when cranston fundraiser joy jacobson 
was explaining that it wasnt unusual for a conservative republican 
keating to contribute to voter projects that registered the 
poor even though they might be expected to vote most often for 
democrats after all she said keating gave to mother teresa 
bennett said im beginning to feel im going to have to call 
the mother as a witness he paused then added as of right 
now i dont intend to 
 
five of the six committee members are southerners heflin trent 
lott rmiss david pryork terry sanford dnc and jesse 
helms rnc heflin who usually speaks in a slow drawl told one 
fasttalking witness to slow down 
committee vicechairman warren rudman rnh who speaks at a 
fast clip himself told the witness he could understand him just 
fine 
 
the hearings have featured several alumni of the us attorneys 
office in washington charles f c ruff representing glenn was 
the us attorney for the district of columbia his assistant in 
the ethics case carol e bruce was an assistant us attorney who 
specialized in prosecuting terrorists bennett also is a former 
assistant us attorney so is raymond banoun who represented 
witness m danny wall the chief thrift regulator after gray left 
office 
 
the hearing also features former journalists including gray 
bennetts assistant amy sabrin and cranston who covered events 
in england germany italy and ethiopia in 193738 for the old 
international news service 
 
heflin and rudman have several times chided defense lawyers for 
their lengthy questioning of witnesses so when riegles lawyer 
thomas green began crossexamination of a witness 10 minutes 
before one days adjournment he began with a preemptive strike 
you just give me the hook when its time to go here green 
told heflin heflin did 10 minutes later just as green was 
working himself up to a fever pitch to confront a witness

the state department meanwhile said that once the americans in 
kuwait have left the eight diplomats in kuwait citys us embassy 
will be withdrawn the embassy will remain open but unstaffed and 
the united states expects the iraqis to safeguard the empty 
premises the state department said

gulf by midjanuary the un resolution approved last week 
authorizes the use of force to drive iraq from kuwait if baghdad 
has not withdrawn by jan 15 
saddam on thursday instructed his rubberstamp parliament to 
free the captives saying he no longer needed them to deter attack 
he said his troops were fully deployed in kuwait seized in a 
dispute over oil land and money 
iraqi armed forces should maintain the highest degree of alert 
and vigilance saddam said because the forces of aggression 
remain on our sacred soil in saudi arabia fanning the flames of 
fire 
at baghdads mansourmelia hotel a group of 50 american and 
british hostages toasted their release by the iraqi parliament 
this is it were all free one hostage shouted when a 
reporter told him of the parliament vote 
robert vinton a businessman from santa fe nm said it is 
a monumental occasion 
bush welcomed saddams decision thursday to free americans and 
other foreigners in kuwait and iraq but said the united states 
must still demand withdrawal weve got to continue to keep the 
pressure on he said 
prime minister john major of britain said he hoped the hostages 
would be coming home soon with no conditions placed on their 
departure but saddam hussein has a lot more to do in terms of 
un security council resolutions and the international community 
will require him to do it all he said 
in saudi arabia us troops also had a message for saddam its 
great the hostages may be home for christmas but the gis are not 
prepared to go home until kuwait is free 
first sgt jerry carlton 37 of warsaw nc said the hostage 
release could signal saddam was caving in or be an effort to buy 
additional time 
first lt brian ratchford 26 of spartanburg sc said i 
think its great theyre going home but its not about the 
hostages i think the hostages were a bad side effect of this whole 
thing 
iraqs national assembly has no record of vetoing decisions by 
saddam but reporters counted 18 of 250 delegates voting today 
against saddams request the assembly speaker sadi mehdi saleh 
said he counted only 15 hands 
definitely we would like to see everyone with his family by 
christmas because that is a very joyous and happy occasion and it 
is time for family reunions said iraqs ambassador to the united 
nations abdul amir alanbari 
a british airways jet stocked with champagne left london for the 
gulf today to pick up hostages planes were also being prepared in 
denmark and japan while dutch officials said they didnt expect to 
send a flight until next week 
among the foreigners who have been barred from leaving iraq are 
about 90 americans and hundreds of others held as human shields 
at military and other strategic sites many more have remained in 
hiding 
in a message for broadcast to the region over voice of america 
the us state department said that until iraq made clear how such 
releases take place stay where you are stay in touch with the 
us embassy and monitor the voa closely we will let you know as 
soon as we have more information 
the british foreign office meanwhile also advised britons in 
hiding in kuwait to stay there 
basically the situation is still unclear a foreign office 
spokesman said the ambassador is obviously in close touch with 
iraqi authorities to clarify what will happen but until plans 
become more clear we are advising people to stay where they are 
out of an estimated 3 million foreigners in the two countries 
before the invasion about 2 million are still left most of them 
asians and arabs who had the option of leaving 
the un security council may meet today to discuss a un draft 
resolution that approves a world conference on the palestinian 
problem 
bush who is touring south america said his administration did 
not support any immediate middle east peace conference renewing 
his rejection of saddams attempt to link resolution of the crisis 
with the arabisraeli conflict 
washington has said however it approves in principle the idea 
of a peace conference at an appropriate time diplomats have 
said that because of a possible appearance of linkage with kuwait 
now is not an appropriate time

grenadas prime minister would like another 
invasion by americans but this time he wants them carrying 
beachbags and cameras instead of rucksacks and automatic rifles 
grenadas economic future depends considerably on tourism 
nicholas brathwaite said in a interview during the 14th annual 
conference on the caribbean which ended friday 
he said his government is looking to tourism as the quickest way 
to get badly needed foreign exchange and give jobs to thousands of 
unemployed youths 
the days when the verdant island of 100000 people was worldwide 
news are gone now brathwaite who steered the islands transition 
to democracy six years ago is back as its elected leader and 
facing an economic mess 
brathwaite a former educator headed the interim government 
installed after the oct 25 1983 us invasion overthrew a 
radical military junta that had seized power in a bloody split of 
the leftists who had staged a 1979 coup 
he had returned to private life after a government was elected a 
year later but he headed the winning grenada national congress in 
elections last march after prime minister herbert blaizes death 
during the same month he concluded that the islands economy 
was in bad shape a recent international monetary fundworld bank 
study team found the budget deficit and debtservicing problems 
were staggering he said 
we were not aware of the true magnitude of the problem he 
said 
grenadas yearend economic report for 1989 showed a 487 
million foreign debt 359 million domestic debt a trade deficit 
of 597 million and 20 percent unemployment 
grenadas hopes of increasing tourism which has traditionally 
lagged behind most other caribbean islands has been helped by the 
recent inauguration of regular flights from the united states 
the island which has a 10000foot runway airport largely built 
by the past leftist governments cuban allies is working on 
broadening its tourist appeal beyond its myriad whitesand beaches 
brathwaite said the government hopes to develop nature trails into 
its mountainous rain forests he said 
brathwaite said the high esteem most grenadians had for 
americans after the invasion has barely ebbed 
there were high expectations and there have been some 
disappointments since but i think grenadians realize the problems 
have been with their own government the united states helped a lot 
with infrastructure he said 
overwhelmingly he said grenadians have warm feelings toward 
americans the us government still sends 110 million a year in 
aid to grenada

bangladeshs interim president said 
friday he is rescinding the emergency powers that ousted president 
hussain muhammad ershad gave himself in an unsuccessful effort to 
save his collapsing regime 
shahabuddin ahmed the former supreme court chief justice who 
took power when ershad resigned thursday also said he will move 
quickly to set up bangladeshs first free parliamentary election in 
a decade 
ershad who seized power in a 1982 coup resigned under pressure 
following seven weeks of street protests led by university students 
and opposition parties 
an independent newspaper the bangladesh observer said at least 
60 people were killed by police and government forces during the 
protests opposition leaders said more than 100 died while the 
government admitted only six dead 
mosques were crowded on friday for the weekly moslem holiday and 
shops were open as dhaka the capital city of seven million people 
began to resume an air of normalcy after almost two months of 
protests 
a committee of political leaders who led the campaign against 
ershad called on ahmed to seize ershads passport freeze his bank 
accounts and put him on trial for corruption 
the recently formed liaison committee of three former opposition 
alliances accused ershad of brutal killing illegal use of arms 
and misuse of power during his eightyear rule 
it also charged him with illegally accumulating wealth 
which he allegedly sent abroad 
a statement released by the committee demanded the arrest of 
ershads wife raushan unlike the wives of previous statesman in 
this moslem country mrs ershad was a public figure who was widely 
disliked for taking advantage of her position 
we definitely want a trial of those who have committd crimes 
and atrocities in the past eight years said khaleda zia an 
opposition leader 
ahmed in his first televised address to the nation did not 
respond directly to the appeal and said his interim administration 
would make no decisions on basic policies 
the main task of my caretaker government will be to conduct a 
free and fair election the people will elect a parliament and my 
duty will end after the parliament is formed he said 
ahmed said he would appoint a council to help him administer the 
country until elections which should be held within 90 days none 
of the members of the caretaker council will be allowed to stand 
for election he said 
he said that within 24 hours he would sign the ordinance 
repealing the special powers act which ershad invoked nov 27 when 
he declared a state of emergency 
the laws suspended personal liberties and empowered the 
government to make arrests without pressing charges 
ershad lifted the emergency restrictions and dissolved 
parliament shortly before he resigned on thursday 
also to be rescinded are other controversial laws which allowed 
the regime to arbitrarily close universities and to change the 
structure of health services ahmed said in his 10minute speech 
he praised the armed forces which he said made a commendable 
contribution to the democratic movement by showing respect for the 
hopes and aspirations of the people 
sources said senior army officers helped persuade ershad to bow 
to the public demands for his resignation 
ahmed called on the military to help maintain order for 
elections which in the past have often turned violent 
ershad held parliamentary elections twice during his regime 
opposition parties boycotted the 1988 election and the 1986 vote 
was widely regarded as rigged by ershads jatiya party 
bangladesh formerly east pakistan became independent in a 
civil war with west pakistan in 1971 until ershad took power it 
was ruled by a succession of presidents installed by the military

despite generous perks and salaries often exceeding 100000 18 
of the nations largest school districts are trying to fill 
superintendencies jobs educators increasingly see as doomed to 
failure 
urban superintendents are quitting or being fired in droves 
because they are expected to perform miracles fail to do so then 
get blamed by politicians business heads parents and 
increasingly meddlesome school boards 
the average tenure of bigcity superintendents is now only 25 
years compared with nearly five years in the 1970s said samuel 
husk executive director of the council of great city schools in 
washington dc 
part of it is our fault i think superintendents tend to agree 
they can do everything then the house of cards falls when they 
cant deliver said san franciscos ramon cortines cortines 
plans to step down as superintendent in august two years before 
his contract expires 
budget pressures are worsening the odds of reform and adding to 
the job strains of bigcity school chiefs said superintendents and 
educators interviewed this week 
urban centers are getting to the point where the job is 
impossible with the political climate the dwindling financial 
support and unrealistic expectations you know when you go i that 
youre doomed to failure said ken underwood president of harold 
webb associates a winnetka ill search firm specializing in 
placing school administrators 
in an average year six to eight major school districts find 
themselves searching for new superintendents according to husk 
but currently there are 18 atlanta and savannah ga boston 
detroit columbus and toledo ohio san francisco austin houston 
and el paso texas indianapolis milwaukee st louis and kansas 
city mo hartford conn tucson ariz charlottemecklenburg 
nc and washington dc 
webb and others say there are still enough good candidates to 
fill the vacancies but educators worry that it will become harder 
to fill jobs that promise little security and almost guarantee 
failure 
salaries in districts with more than 25000 students averaged 
95735 in the 198990 school year according to the educational 
research service a private nonprofit firm in arlington va many 
offer generous annuities housing allowances and pensions 
salaries in several of those top 100000 125000 in houston 
116000 in san francisco 112000 in atlanta 110000 in 
milwaukee 109180 in austin texas 109000 in detroit and 
101237 in st louis 
but more and more urban superintendents seem to be saying that 
no amount of pay can compensate jobs that are being made political 
scapegoats for decades of urban school failure 
six weeks ago memphis willie herenton quit the 96304 
superintendency hed held for 11 years because of disputes over 
school funds 
washington dcs board fired superintendent andrew jenkins 
last week he accused school board members of going around him in 
dealing with teachers and others on curriculum and other matters 
san franciscos cortines said board interference in personnel 
matters was one reason he had decided to quit by august though his 
contract runs through 1993 
in boston this week the city council voted to abolish the 
school committee after a fruitless sixmonth search to replace 
outgoing superintendent laval wilson 
wilson who is black was fired from the 95000 boston post 
last february just weeks after the school committee had given him a 
highly favorable job evaluation supporters contend race played a 
role in his dismissal 
the people who have the background in the trenches dont seem 
to be giving up on the possibilities said jeremiah floyd 
associate executive director of the national association of 
secondary school principals 
they just know that once you take on the mission you have to 
do it in a hurry because the longevity is not there at all

arizona gov rose mofford defended sen dennis 
deconcini at ethics hearings friday testifying that his help for 
charles h keating jr came when the businessman was held in high 
esteem 
mofford who knew the arizona democrat as a 10yearold altar 
boy was a character witness for deconcini one of five senators 
under investigation for their intervention on behalf of former sampl 
owner keating 
she testified keating was considered a very successful 
businessman and very charitable in 1987 when the senators 
discussed his complaints with thrift regulators 
keatings american continental corp of phoenix parent of 
californiabased lincoln savings and loan association employed 
3500 people in 1987 ms mofford said the corporation was a major 
lender in arizona and considered a solid company in which to 
invest 
federal regulators closed lincoln a failure thats expected to 
cost taxpayers 23 billion 
the committee is trying to learn whether the 13 million raised 
for the five senators by keating and associates influenced the 
conduct of deconcini or sens john mccain rariz donald w 
riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and alan cranston 
dcalif 
a theme in the defense of all five senators is that they 
provided normal constituent service to keating who complained that 
lincoln was unfairly treated by thrift regulators 
his work with constituencies certainly was a hallmark of 
deconcinis career mofford said 
a problem was never too big or too small she said any 
time there was a problem with the federal government everyone 
would say call dennis deconcinis office 
one of deconcinis accomplishments mofford said was getting 
president bushs antidrug coordinator william bennett to make 
the arizonamexico border a high priority area for drug 
interdiction 
bennett recently named republican national chairman is the 
brother of robert s bennett the ethics committees special 
counsel in the keating case 
after moffords testimony which lasted less than 20 minutes

when army jeeps approach 
this hilltop palestinian village old women blow a warning with 
whistles hanging from their necks wanted men slip into hiding and 
iron courtyard gates slam shut 
after three years the uprising against israeli rule has become 
a way of life for the 17 million palestinians in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
many are exhausted by the daily hardships disappointed that 
their struggle has brought no political gains and aware that the 
persian gulf crisis has overshadowed their revolt 
but most say there is no turning back 
the world has heard our voice and we must continue said 
amal a 27yearold woman from kufr nama whose quiet village life 
was turned upside down by the revolt that erupted on dec 9 1987 
a day earlier four arabs had been killed in a crash with an 
israeli truck rumors spread that the accident was intentional and 
the violence escalated after that 
before the uprising amals husband nassif 29 worked in an 
israeli aluminum factory and made enough money for such luxuries as 
fancy dresses for their two daughters ages 3 and 5 
today nassif is an activist on the run from the army sleeping 
in the hills at night and sneaking home only briefly he raises 
chickens barely eking out a living 
amal who is pregnant said she lies awake many nights worrying 
about her absent husband i always expect a knock at the door 
thinking its the army she said 
her fears are not without reason in the stone houses along kufr 
namas steep winding streets hardly a family has been untouched 
by the intefadeh arabic for uprising 
the village 10 miles northwest of jerusalem has 2500 
residents two have been killed and 50 wounded by troops one has 
been deported and some 200 have been jailed 
the story is much the same throughout the west bank and gaza in 
the last three years more than 770 palestinians have been killed 
by israelis and about 300 others have been slain by fellow arabs 
mostly as suspected informers fiftytwo israelis have died in the 
violence 
at least 60000 palestinians have been jailed at one time or 
another in the uprising in midnovember 10009 were in custody 
including 790 held under emergency regulations allowing detention 
for up to a year without charges 
the army also has demolished or sealed 620 palestinian homes to 
punish suspected militants ignoring western protests that the 
practice violates human rights 
today the massive demonstrations of the uprisings early days 
have shrunk to small stonethrowing attacks on soldiers deaths 
and injuries are fewer 
lately in fact more palestinians have been killed as 
collaborators by fellow arabs than have been slain by soldiers 
a senior military official said that after three years the army 
is better prepared for uprising riots army jeeps are protected by 
steel mesh and soldiers often avoid such obvious hot spots as 
mosques and schools 
the uprising is by no means over but we have taken a lot of 
steam out of it said the official who cannot be named under 
military rules 
to try to prevent violence linked to the uprisings third 
anniversary over the weekend the army beefed up its forces in the 
occupied territories friday and confined more than 735000 arabs to 
their homes 
lately the most fearful aspect of the revolt for israelis has 
been a wave of stabbing attacks that followed the oct 8 temple 
mount riots in jerusalem in which 17 palestinians died in police 
gunfire 
israelis responded to the stabbings with revenge attacks of 
their own and demands that palestinians be blocked from working in 
israel authorities say they expect to deny working permits to more 
than half the 110000 palestinians with jobs in israel 
the move comes as israel is trying to find work for thousands of 
newly arrived soviet jewish immigrants but some israelis argue 
that denying jobs to palestinians already bitter and frustrated by 
israels occupation could backfire into more violence 
we have passed from the era of the stones to the era of 
knives im afraid that soon well reach the era of guns said 
israeli lawmaker yossi sarid of the liberal citizens rights 
movement 
for their part the palestinians admit to being discouraged by 
diminished hopes for peace 
israels new government formed last june is dominated by 
rightwingers who oppose giving up any of the land israel captured 
in the 1967 middle east war palestinians also have lost 
international sympathy by supporting iraqi president saddam hussein 
in the gulf crisis 
uprising leaders say their job now is to make a reality of the 
palestinian state proclaimed on paper by the palestine liberation 
organizations parliamentinexile on nov 15 1988 
in kufr nama nassif and his friends are working toward economic 
independence by organizing the villages more than 100 chicken 
farmers who provide most of its income into a cooperative 
the three years of revolt have also allowed young activists to 
smash the rule of traditional clan leaders kufr nama is now run by 
a popular committee of the four major plo factions who mediate 
land disputes and organize defense against army raids 
elderly women in palestinian embroidered dresses are the early 
warning system they watch the two winding roads into town and 
listen for sounds of military convoys blowing their whistles at 
any sign of trouble

the army sent reinforcements to the occupied 
lands friday and imposed military curfews on towns and villages in 
an effort to thwart attacks marking the third anniversary of the 
palestinian uprising 
underground uprising leaders called a twoday general strike for 
the weekend and a marxist plo faction the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine urged massive martyrdom to mark the 
anniversary 
the palestinians in the west bank have every good reason now 
to carry out spectacular attacks in the territories a senior 
army officer was quoted as saying in the maariv newspaper 
the prime minister is in the united states us secretary of 
state james a baker is about to meet with the president of iraq 
the third anniversary of the uprising is approaching and there is 
a feeling that because of the gulf crisis the uprising has been 
removed from the headlines the unidentified officer was quoted 
as saying 
an army spokesman said reinforcements have been sent into the 
west bank and gaza strip and that special measures including 
covert operations were ordered to thwart violence 
the army also clamped curfews on the largest of the territories 
towns gaza city nablus and hebron and many refugee camps it 
declared other sectors closed military areas barring 
journalists from entering 
the curfews essentially mean that an estimated 735000 
palestinians living in those areas are ordered to stay home 
the strike saturday was called to mark two months since the 
temple mount riots in which at least 17 palestinians were killed by 
israeli police uprising leaders said the second day of the strike 
would mark the anniversary of the uprising which broke out dec 
9 1987 
the results of a newly published poll meanwhile showed that 
the uprising has made 42 percent of israelis more hawkish it said 
opinion was divided on how to solve the conflict 
the survey of 1200 israeli jews said only 6 percent had become 
more dovish while 25 percent had experienced no change of opinion 
seven percent were undecided according to the poll conducted by 
the smith research center for the weekly jerusalem report news 
magazine 
on the question of how to solve the conflict 21 percent wanted 
to expel all or some of the palestinians from the territories and 
20 percent thought israel should withdraw from the gaza strip 
regarded as the most troublesome occupied area 
twentyfive percent favored some sort of statehood for the 17 
million palestinians of the west bank and gaza the poll said six 
percent favored annexing the west bank 9 percent opted for 
preserving the present situation and 19 percent had no opinion it 
said 
since the uprising began 776 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians fiftythree israelis have died in 
the violence 
in addition 316 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaboration with israel

columbias astronauts with help 
from scientists on the ground pushed forward with their stargazing 
friday in a rush to make as many observations as possible with the 
shuttles telescopes 
the four astronomers aboard columbia talked about their problems 
operating the 150 million astro observatory during a live lesson 
from space for middle school students and a questionandanswer 
session 
unfortunately weve had some failures with computer terminals 
which have caused us to have to redo the way that we operate this 
mission so its been quite tedious and timeconsuming to figure 
out how to do that astronaut ron parise told 41 youngsters at 
nasa centers in alabama and maryland 
but were slowly working around everything and were getting 
science data and doing our job parise said 
added astronaut jeffrey hoffman weve shown that in space 
flight you have to be extremely adaptable and be able to 
accommodate things that fail and ways of operating which we never 
even planned before 
observations were halted for half a day thursday when a flight 
deck computer overheated and shut down the only other onboard 
computer for operating astros three ultraviolet telecopes failed 
in a similar manner sunday 
lint probably from clothing worn by the sevenman crew was 
found clogging the air vents of the computer that failed sunday 
after the lint was removed thursday the terminal was turned on but 
immediately turned off when a burning odor once again filled the 
cabin 
flight director bob castle said it was not known whether the 
lint was the cause of the problem and whether that made the other 
computer fail the lint will be analyzed after the flight to 
determine its source he said 
following thursdays failure nasa hurriedly devised and 
implemented a plan in which ground teams aim and turn on the 
telescopes with the astronauts using a joystick to zero in on the 
targets the telescopes were tested successfully one by one and by 
friday were producing results surpassing scientists expectations 
parise and fellow astronaut robert parker for example focused 
all three telescopes on a quasar for 51 minutes three minutes 
longer than planned 
thats what happens when you have good oldfashioned 
astronomy and a little bit of help from your friends parker 
told spacelab mission operations control in huntsville ala 
other highenergy targets observed friday included numerous 
galaxies and a supernova that exploded in 1987 
arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university principal 
investigator of one of the telescopes said the results demonstrate 
this is not a failure by any stretch of anybodys imagination 
he likened the 10day mission to a football game 
when the second computer failed we went in and changed the 
game plan entirely and now were making so much progress its 
unbelievable almost every play is a first down davidsen said 
i think were winning this game now 
some scientists includng barbara pfarr of the ultraviolet 
imaging telescope team even were enjoying the new method of 
operation because of their increased participation 
commanding from the ground is rather fun she said 
one of the more exciting findings of the day came from astros 
xray telescope which was unaffected by the computer problems the 
instrument has its own pointing system and is controlled by 
computer commands sent from goddard space flight center in 
greenbelt md 
goddard scientist peter serlemitsos the xray telescopes 
principal investigator said he found conditions to be right for a 
black hole to exist in a seyfert galaxy one with a bright 
compact center 325 million light years away that in turn 
tells us that indeed there are likely to be giant black holes at 
the centers of these galaxies he said 
the mission which ends tuesday has been plagued by instrument 
problems since columbia blasted off sunday in addition to the 
failed computers the crew has had to contend with a faulty 
instrument pointing system 
because the astronauts had to manually steer the ultraviolet 
telescopes rather than use the automatic pointing system only 70 
of 187 observations were accomplished before thursdays computer 
failure the national aeronautics and space administration said 
scientists had hoped to study about 250 objects including some 
of the hottest most violent stars in the universe ultraviolet 
light and xrays emitted from such objects is absorbed by earths 
atmosphere and thus invisible from the ground 
deputy mission scientist gene urban said it was not known how 
many of the targets will have to be scrapped because of the delays

david t bests journey to honor a childhood 
friend killed 49 years ago at pearl harbor ended friday at the 
stark limestone facade of the indiana world war memorial 
best 72 traveled from his hayward calif home to join other 
world war ii veterans at a service honoring the 2403 americans 
killed in japans assault on the pacific fleet 
best glanced at a photograph of paul b free whose life ended 
at 20 as he climbed into his airplane on dec 7 1941 
few things stir mans compassion so deeply as remembering the 
supreme sacrifice of an old buddy sleep comrade sleep in 
peace best said 
veterans alternated reading 10 names a minute while tolling a 
large silver bell from the uss indianapolis one time for each 
american who died 
similar ceremonies took place elsewhere including in hawaii 
where dignitaries boarded the uss arizona memorial for wreath 
presentations a 21gun salute and echo taps at the pearl harbor 
naval base a missing man flyover by hawaii air national guard 
jets ended a minute of silence marking the time of the attack 
best a selfdescribed loyal patriotic american who gets 
choked up when the starspangled banner plays grew up in 
williamsport pa and returned there in 1988 to unveil a plaque 
commemorating free as the citys first resident killed in world war 
ii 
we made a pact that he would enlist in the army air corps and 
i would try to get aviation experience of course then he was 
killed said best who later trained b17 radar bombardiers and 
navigators in florida 
when i got the terse telegram about frees death i was just 
a 21yearold kid i was in shock i didnt know how to cope so 
then i enlisted i have never forgotten him and i never will 
that was a feeling shared by about 100 people who stood in 
28degree weather as a bugler from fort benjamin harrison in 
indianapolis played taps yellow ribbons decorated the bare 
branches of trees around the monument on the downtown american 
legion mall 
the uss indianapolis was sunk between guam and the philippines 
by a japanese submarine july 30 1945 two days after it unloaded 
parts and nuclear material used in the atomic bombs dropped on 
hiroshima and nagasaki the bell later was recovered from the ship

japanese on a lovely hawaiian morning 49 years ago americans who 
saw the sun rise did not see it set said the rev russell 
blowers minister of the 91st street christian church and veteran 
of the eighth air force with the tolling of the bell remind us 
that someday the bell will toll for us 
we are hoping this will lead to bells tolling all over the 
country next year on the 50th anniversary said elbert watson 
chairman of the world war ii national commemorative association 
which sponsored fridays service 
watson asked the japanese government to apologize for the attack 
that drew the united states into world war ii some japanese are 
trying to persuade their leaders to apologize before president bush 
visits japan next spring 
japan has apologized to south korea and china for its military 
actions in the 1930s and 1940s no official apology has been issued 
to the united states 
an apology by prime minister toshiki kaifu or emperor akihito 
would go a long way toward helping both countries put the war 
behind them and get on with properly commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of world war ii watson said

an influential democratic senator marking the 
anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor referred friday 
to the persian gulf crisis and warned it is unwise to tempt 
tyrants with messages of weakness 
sen daniel inouye of hawaii did not mention iraqi president 
saddam hussein by name in his speech but the chairman of the 
senate democratic steering committee predicted this tyrant in the 
desert will be turned back by american resolve 
inouye said the united states entered world war ii and the 
korean war unprepared because of public demands to dismantle the 
military 
today we once again find ourselves with a tyrant ready to test 
the will and resolve of the american people inouye said 
but this time this tyrant knows that our barricades have not 
been torn down and that our swords and spears have not been 
permitted to rust and that the people of america if circumstances 
force them to do so are willing to send their sons and daughters 
to stop this tyrant he said 
many of us who solemnly gather this morning have felt the hot 
sting of shrapnel and seen our bodies torn by bullets said 
inouye who lost his right arm during world war ii combat 
though we sing the many songs of glory we know that war is 
ugly dirty painful and deadly 
but to make certain american men and women need not go into 
combat we should always listen to the wise words of the ancient 
ones who counsel our people not to tempt tyrants with messages of 
weakness he said 
we should always remember this moment of infamy 
the ceremony aboard the uss arizona memorial included wreath 
presentations by veterans patriotic and civic organizations a 
21gun salute and echo taps 
one minute of silence was observed throughout the pearl harbor 
naval base at 755 am the time the dec 7 1941 attack began 
the moment of silence ended with a missing man flyover by 
hawaii air national guard jets 
the gleaming white memorial spans the sunken battleship which 
still contains the remains of 1102 crewmen who died in the attack 
author ted mason a survivor of the pearl harbor attack was 
keynote speaker at a concurrent ceremony held at the arizona 
memorial visitor center 
ceremonies also were held at several other oahu military bases 
during the day 
honolulu city officials used the occasion to dedicate a gift 
from the city of nagasaki japan which provided a replica of a 
cathedral bell that survived the atomic bomb blast on aug 9 1945

a series of six earthquakes registering up to 55 
on the richter scale shook central japan on friday there were no 
immediate reports of damage or casualties 
the first quake was reported in the nagano and takada areas 
about 110 miles northwest of tokyo and around niigata about 160 
miles northwest of the capital the meteorological agency said 
five more temblors were reported within two hours in the general 
area the agency said the earthquakes epicenter was at a depth of 
less than three miles in western niigata prefecture 
police in nagano and niigata reported no injuries or damages 
the richter scale measures ground motion with each digit 
representing a tenfold increase in magnitude a reading of 4 can 
cause moderate damage and a 6 can bring severe damage in populated 
areas 
the quakes were apparently too small to satisfy a prediction by 
iben browning a new mexico physicist and selfprofessed 
climatologist who predicted a high probability of a severe 
earthquake in tokyo missouri or california between dec 24 
few officials reacted to the report in japan one of the most 
earthquakeactive nations in the world

iraq has authorized a group of western 
pacifists to set up a peace camp at the saudi border between the 
antiiraqi multinational force and baghdads troops a british 
activist said friday 
pat arrowsmith the leader of the group calling itself the gulf 
peace team said the first 100 volunteers will establish their camp 
dec 17 she said hundreds of others will follow 
she said the group asked to be camped on the iraqisaudi border 
to show it does not mean to side with iraq 
we are a neutral autonomous group who offered to be between 
the two sides to stop war getting started arrowsmith said we 
are telling them that if they want to fight they will do that on 
our own bodies 
she said adnan dawoud salman head of the iraqi friendship and 
solidarity society had informed her thursday of the official 
decision to allow the camp 
adnan a senior government official and acting head of the 
presidency office was not available to comment 
the pacifists also intend to ask saudi arabia to allow a similar 
camp on its side of the border with iraq

iraqs decision to release all its 
hostages is the latest in a flurry of diplomatic steps that could 
lead to a peaceful resolution of the persian gulf crisis 
the question now is whether each side is prepared to retreat on 
enough other issues to reach a settlement that would let everyone 
save some face 
any such resolution would force all parties to step back from 
original aims leaving none completely satisfied but war could be 
avoided 
since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait president saddam hussein 
has proclaimed iraqs determination to fight if necessary to hold 
onto the annexed emirate 
led by president bush a 26nation allied force has massed in 
the gulf in readiness for a possible military strike to liberate 
kuwait 
secretary of state james a baker iiis diplomacy won security 
council approval last week for a military campaign after jan 15 if 
saddam does not withdraw his troops from kuwait 
with both sides digging in for the jan 15 deadline diplomatic 
initiatives suddenly burst forth beginning the day after the 
security councils approval of the useofforce resolution 
bush invited iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to come to 
washington for talks on the crisis and proposed sending baker to 
baghdad to meet with saddam iraq accepted the proposal within 
days 
even more dramatically saddam on thursday proposed the release 
of all hostages and the iraqi parliament approved the action 
friday iraqi officials predicted they would all be home by 
christmas 
the hostage release fulfills one of the three key demands of the 
security council iraq still must withdraw from kuwait and restore 
the emirs government 
saddam for his part has said that any withdrawal from kuwait 
must be discussed in conjunction with an overall middle east peace 
settlement that would result in a homeland for the palestinians 
bush and the us state department have emphasized that there is 
no linkage between the gulf crisis and the palestine issue 
however the united states has been allowing the security 
council to give a nod in the direction of a middle east peace 
conference this week as one highranking us diplomat put it 
privately 
the united states has a longstanding policy of supporting an 
international middle east peace conference at an appropriate 
time but has never let the security council come out in favor of 
such a highlevel meeting which israel bitterly opposes 
this week however the united states agreed in principle with 
the other security council members with veto power the soviet 
union britain france and china to let the council endorse such 
a conference 
a comprehensive middle east peace settlement would necessarily 
have to settle the palestinian homeland question saddams key 
demand 
with all these elements falling into place an overall 
diplomatic solution to the crisis begins to emerge no one would 
get everything they want but war could be averted 
a solution could evolve following the bakersaddam talks and 
bushs meeting with aziz iraq might decide to begin discussions 
the uns midjanuary deadline could pass but there would be no 
rush to war while talks continue 
some of the issues that would have to be dealt with in such 
talks are saddams eventual withdrawal from kuwait restoration of 
the emirs government and baghdads grievances about oil revenues 
and access to the gulf 
two uninhabited islands off the shattalarab waterway to iraq 
might prove to a key bargaining point if kuwait were to agree to 
lease the islands to give baghdad security over access to the 
shatt 
according to some reports baghdad might consider withdrawing 
from kuwait if it retains the southern end of the rumailah oil 
filed straddling their border thus gaining more oil revenues 
baghdad had accused kuwait of tapping oil that was rightfully 
iraqs 
if talks are initiated the security council might take the 
first steps toward a middle east peace conference to be held at 
an appropriate time and with the participation of the parties 
concerned but israel would have to agree to the convening of the 
conference and this is far from certain

violence between hindus and moslems broke 
out in southern india friday and at least 16 people were killed in 
stabbings news reports said four others were killed elsewhere in 
the nation 
authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on the southern town 
hyderabad confining people to their homes press trust of india 
said the violence started in the morning and continued throughout 
the day despite the curfew 
fighting between followers of the two faiths also erupted in 
northern aligarh where at least three people were killed and 12 
injured press trust reported a curfew was also imposed in 
aligarh it said 
and in ayodhya the flashpoint of a lingering dispute between 
the religious groups a moslem man was burned to death after hindu 
fundamentalists accused him of trying to disrupt their campaign to 
replace a mosque with a temple 
the identities of victims were not given indian news media do 
not identify the victims or perpetrators of sectarian violence for 
fear it might exacerbate tensions 
at least 380 people have died in hindumoslem violence in the 
last two months since hindu fundamentalists announced plans to pull 
down a disputed mosque in ayodhya and replace it with a temple 
at least 22 people were killed when police opened fire on hindu 
militants attempting to storm the mosque on oct 30 and again on 
nov 2 
on thursday the militants resumed their campaign to storm the 
temple but they did not resist when police blocked them from 
reaching the disputed shrine apparently because of an 
understanding the event would be more symbolic than real 
the religious crisis ignited by the hindu campaign brought down 
the government of former prime minister vp singh last month 
singhs coalition lost its parliamentary majority after a hindu 
fundamentalist party withdrew support over the prime ministers 
ayodhya policy 
singh was replaced nov 10 by chandra shekhar who has said he 
will attempt to defuse the issue by holding talks with moslem and 
hindu leaders the talks began in new delhi earlier this week but 
have made no real progress 
the dispute over the mosque has lingered for more than 100 
years hindus say moslem invaders built the small mosque atop a 
temple marking the birthplace of rama a hindu god moslems say it 
is impossible to say where rama was born 
hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million people 
moslems make up 12 percent

growth in consumer credit slowed to a 
seasonally adjusted 147 billion in october the government 
reported friday analysts said it was another sign of a weakening 
economy 
that is minuscule a very very small increase said 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group a washington 
management consulting firm it mostly reflects that we have a 
real softening in the kinds of purchases that people usually use 
credit for cars furniture appliances 
consumer spending is weak and its not surprising that 
consumer credit is weak she said consumers are much more 
leery about using credit given the business and economic 
environment 
the federal reserve said consumer credit grew at an annual rate 
of 24 percent down from a revised 46 percent rate posted in 
september the september rate was even slower than the 49 percent 
advance originally reported 
growth in revolving credit slowed in october from september 
the central bank said auto loans outstanding declined further in 
october as did loans for mobile homes 
revolving or credit card debt increased 156 billion or an 
annual rate of 86 percent that was down from a 129 percent gain 
in september and a 133 percent advance a month earlier 
automobile loans declined 785 million a 33 percent annual 
rate auto loans which fell 01 percent in september have 
declined every month this year except for january and march 
ms shaber said the auto loan component is more evidence that 
relatively strong car sales in october were due more to fleet sales 
than purchases by ordinary consumers 
it verifies that it was not ordinary consumers who were buying 
cars in october she said 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 880 
million a 50 percent rate which was up slightly from 49 percent 
the previous month 
borrowing for mobile homes fell 188 million or a 100 percent 
rate after declining 158 percent in september 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of 
october at 7367 billion

shuttle astronauts reviving the 
teacherinspace dreams of christa mcauliffe beamed a celestial 
lesson to 41 middle school students friday allowing the 
problemplagued columbia mission to create the first space 
classrooms 
you may have heard of some of the problems weve been 
having astronaut jeffrey hoffman told the youngsters watching 
him on television screens at two nasa centers its been quite an 
interesting and dynamic mission 
the shuttles 150 million astro observatory crippled by 
computer failures was put back in operation friday with the help 
of commands sent from the ground but possibly more significant 
the lessons beamed from 218 miles above earth to american 
schoolchildren helped the space agency regenerate some of the goals 
struck down in the challenger disaster 
we werent trying to take the place of what they were going to 
do on challenger said karen widenhofer a madison county ala 
teacher on temporary assignment with nasa who assisted in the 
classroom friday at marshall space flight center at huntsville 
but this shows that nasa is still interested in education and 
encouraging students in science and math 
nasa still plans to put a teacher in space 
fridays space lesson conducted by four of the seven astronauts 
aboard columbia took place nearly five years after the jan 28 
1986 explosion of challenger that killed all seven aboard that 
shuttle including mrs mcauliffe a new hampshire schoolteacher 
denny elkins a ninthgrader from snellville ga was one of 
the 12 middle school students from four southeastern states who sat 
at a horseshoeshaped desk in the space classroom at marshall he 
said he was watching on tv when challengers liftoff turned into a 
fireball in the sky 
i saw it live because i already was interested in space 
travel he said the explosion with the biggest impression of 
my life i really wanted to be an astronaut but when i saw that i 
said no 
now he said im reconsidering 
during the opening 35minute lesson which was about 15 minutes 
late because of a communications linkup problem hoffman wore a 
dress shirt and tie usually astronauts wear casual clothes except 
for the space suits put on for takeoffs and landings 
when i started thinking about giving a classroom talk in 
space i thought back to my own school days and i realized that all 
of the men teachers i had wore ties hoffman said 
as far as i know nobodys ever worn a tie in space i thought 
id give it a try and see what it looks like in celebration of this 
space classroom occasion and i can tell you it works quite well 
you have to be a little careful in zerogravity as you can see 
hoffman said pushing down his floating burgundy patterned tie 
after hoffman and astronaut sam durrance conducted their lesson 
focusing on star formations and celestial radiation ms widenhofer 
gave students at marshall about an hourlong class another 29 
students took part in a similar space classroom at goddard space 
fllight center in greenbelt md the space schoolhouse concluded 
with astronauts ron parise and robert parker fielding questions 
from the students on earth 
id like to know what is the most tedious and painstaking part 
of your mission so far said mario trimble ninthgrader from 
montgomery ala 
when you fly a mission most of the time is scheduled very 
tightly and there are a lot of things to do responded parise 
unfortunately some failures with computer terminals have caused 
us to redo the way were doing our mission were slowly working 
around everything 
bart doran of glen miss wanted to know how the problems had 
affected the columbias missions 
very greatly astronautastronomer parker said explaining 
that some of the telescope operations had to be done by hand 
instead of by computers 
troubles persisting throughout the mission have forced the 
astronauts to miss more than 100 planned observations about 250 
celestial targets were to have been studied 
the two computers able to run the observatorys three 
ultraviolet telescopes both failed flight director gary coen said 
the cause of the computer failures has not been determined and he 
didnt know if it was connected to a lint buildup in the equipment 
on friday the astro observatory was being run by commands sent 
from the ground to guide the telescopes toward their desired 
targets the astronauts used a joystick and aided by information 
from the ground zeroed in on objects 
the success of this process thursday night and friday gave 
scientists hope that many more observations can be made before 
columbias 10day flight ends tuesday 
our attitude here is that weve got a mode we feel is going to 
work and were going to go get the science mission manager jack 
jones said but he added he didnt know yet how efficient the 
operation would be 
spacelab mission operations controls john david bartoe 
congratulated the astronauts friday morning for obtaining 
fantastic observations of a quasar one of the most distant 
objects in the universe all three ultraviolet telescopes focused 
on the quasar for 51 minutes three minutes longer than planned 
thats what happens when you have good oldfashioned 
astronomy and a little bit of help from your friends parker 
told bartoe 
the space classroom programs will be available via some cable 
television companies to classrooms 
to illustrate the importance of studying all types of radiation 
emitted from celestial objects durrance played two versions of the 
theme from the film star wars 
low and highfrequency notes were filtered electronically from 
the first version and the taped music was unrecognizable the same 
measures then were played with all the notes 
as you can see you need to hear all the notes to recognize 
the song to appreciate its full musical quality durrance said 
studying the universe is the same way the universe is playing a 
kind of symphony in the light that its produces 
up here in space our telescopes can see al the radiation to 
better understand the universe thats why some other astronomers 
and i are in the shuttle this week using an observatory called atro 
to study the stars 
the youngsters will tour marshall and talk with its scientists 
and control team members by the time their visit ends sunday 
marshall is the location of spacelab mission operations control 
which is in charge of columbias astronomy work 
willie carter an eighthgrader from memphis tenn said the 
country is sort of regaining from the challenger explosion this 
has probably put more hope in all of us i feel better now that 
weve got something going compared to the explosion

polands first popular presidential 
campaign officially ended friday with lech walesa enjoying a big 
lead and underdog challenger stanislaw tyminski being booed at his 
own rally 
two days before sundays vote the solidarity chairman was 
awarded a strong endorsement from the head of the countrys roman 
catholic church to which more than 90 percent of the population 
belongs 
the polish church will side with walesa cardinal jozef 
glemp announced the unusually explicit statement came after a 
meeting in rome with polishborn pope john paul ii 
this is not a political decision but a decision based on 
certainty of the common good for the whole country glemp 
said 
tyminski was trying to recapture the momentum that allowed him 
to upset prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and capture second place 
in the first round nov 25 
he conducted a strong firstround race even though he was a 
previously unknown businessman who had just spent 21 years in 
canada and peru 
however the last state television election poll conducted 
monday and tuesday showed walesa with a 73 percent to 16 percent 
advantage two other polls put the margin at 58 percent to 23 
percent and 61 percent to 20 percent 
on his final stop of the campaign tyminski told supporters in 
szczecin he would not leave poland again regardless of the 
election outcome 
szczecin a northwestern harbor city traditionally has been a 
center of opposition to walesa 
but walesa supporters made up much of the 4000 people at the 
rally they booed tymisnki and shouted back to peru one banner 
called tyminski tarzan from peru 
the rally was tyminskis last chance to release supposedly 
compromising materials of walesa that he repeatedly claimed to have 
in a black briefcase but he held off claiming disclosure would 
be harmful for our country 
walesa had insisted no compromising documents existed 
walesa who rose from shipyard electrician to lead eastern 
europes first postwar independent labor union stayed at 
solidarity headquarters friday 
aides said he planned no public appearances before the vote 
by law electioneering was banned from noon friday a campaign 
news blackout was observed by polish newspapers and broadcasters 
polls open at 6 am sunday and close at 8 pm for the 
countrys 27 million eligible voters 
if official results are not challenged a president could be 
sworn in by weeks end to replace president wojciech jaruzelski 
in the first round walesa obtained 40 percent of the votes 
compared to tyminskis 23 percent and mazowieckis 18 percent 
tyminski concentrated his campaign on disaffected farmers and 
miners worried about their future under a shock economic program 
he blamed walesa and mazowiecki for the hardships of the past 18 
months and promised to improve living conditions within one month 
in recent days however tyminski himself became an issue 
reports highlighted his long absence from poland links to former 
members of the communist party reported visits to libya 
accusations he used hallucinogenic drugs in peru and one couples 
allegation that he abused his wife in canada 
the mobilization against tyminski unfortunately resembles 
a witch hunt the newspaper gazeta wyborcza commented friday 
even when the cause is right such efforts should not be 
organized that is why we welcome with relief the end of the 
presidential race

a log chronicling the b29 mission that dropped 
the atomic bomb on hiroshima did not sell at auction friday after 
christies announced it could not guarantee it was the original 
record kept by the navigator 
auctioneer stephen massey opened bidding at 40000 after saying 
the auction house did not doubt the authenticity of the log 
there may be another authentic document he said 
no bids were offered and the auctioneer did not go lower before 
the doubts about the authenticity the auction house had estimated 
the log would sell for 100000 to 150000 
the auction house said it was a coincidence that the document 
was offered on pearl harbor day 
the navigator theodore j van kirk told christies auction 
house in a telephone call last week that he still has the log he 
wrote on the mission christies manuscript specialist chris coover 
said 
christies officials spent a week investigating the claim then 
decided to back away from the catalog description of the log put on 
the auction block friday said coover the log had been described 
as the original manuscript navigators log of the b29 bomber the 
enola gay 
christies considered withdrawing the log from the sale but 
we have confidence that were selling an authentic record of the 
mission coover said 
auction house officials said in a statement released late 
thursday that they still believed the log was an authentic record 
made contemporaneously with the mission 
another sale item generating interest friday was a letter 
written by ethan allen which the university of vermont hoped to 
buy to keep the historical manuscript in the state 
christies put the log on the block for eileen lewis widow of 
capt robert a lewis enola gays copilot mrs lewis hoped to 
use the sale proceeds for her retirement said coover its 
estimated selling price was 100000 to 150000 
the log put on sale records basic flight information such as 
position altitude air speed and compass direction on three 
yellow oblong sheets 
the 915 am entry of the document chronicling the 12hour 
roundtrip mission from the us base in the marianas islands to 
hiroshima simply says bombaway 
the bombing which marked the worlds introduction to nuclear 
weapons left 130000 casualties 
on friday the new york times quoted the navigator as saying 
during a telephone interview from his home near san francisco i 
am quite confident that the log which i have in my possession is 
the one i kept on the airplane 
van kirk plans to donate his log to an asyetunidentified 
american institution coover said 
the university of vermont meanwhile sent a bidder to the sale 
in hopes of buying the 1787 letter by ethan allen which discussed 
a possible trade agreement between thenindependent vermont and 
canada 
the university raised about 15000 from individual collectors 
and small foundations to buy the letter which was valued at 
15000 to 20000 
it would be a terrible shame if the letter ends up outside 
vermont j kevin graffagnino curator of the universitys 
vermont collection said recently it belongs in vermont 
vermont became part of the united states in 1791 allen led the 
green mountain boys in a famous raid on fort ticonderoga during the 
american revolution 
the university has the most extensive collection of allen papers 
in the world and this year paid 13000 for a 1775 allen letter

a woman who thought she won 25000 
in a cocacola usa contest said she was heartbroken to see her 
expected windfall vanish after being told her entry was invalid 
cheryl hoch 43 of traverse city is one of four people in 
michigan who thought they won 25000 grand prizes in the diet coke 
super bowl contest 
they each claim to have collected all five game pieces from 
bottle caps and cardboard packages but officials of the soft drink 
company say all of the players game pieces are not the real thing 
hoch met thursday with representatives from cocacola and dl 
blair corp the nebraska company that judged the contest the 
representatives tried to explain to her why she had not won 
im not convinced she said after the meeting 
cocacola spokesman bob bertini said the dispute centers around 
game pieces marked xxii of which only five were printed he 
said the xxii pieces the wouldbe winners had were not authentic 
there by and large is a situation where people dont fully 
understand how the game operates or accidentally cut out the game 
piece in the wrong way he said 
traverse city attorney david kipley who also believed he had 
won said the extra xxiis may actually be xxiii with the last digit 
missing either accidentally left off by the printing machine or 
cut off by the contestants 
hoch who is married with two sons said she did not cheat by 
cutting off the last digit of the game piece 
i would never even think of doing anything like that she 
said 
bertini said there are a miniscule number of similar 
rejected prize claims but he refused to specify how many he 
rejected kipleys speculation that some game pieces could have been 
misprinted 
it is not a misprint problem bertini said if it were a 
misprint with 225 million game pieces out there you would have 
widespread problems and that is just not the case 
he said it is coincidence that three of the cases are in 
traverse city 
terry brechbill vice president of dl blair which informed 
each player that their entries were invalid did not return phone 
calls thursday and friday 
hoch said contest representatives showed her a photocopy of her 
game ticket thursday and tried to show her the beginning of the 
extra digit she said she did not believe them 
its heartbreaking she said its not nice and its not 
right

soviet soldiers on friday began hauling away what 
used to be west berlins cold war food reserves for shipment to the 
soviet union 
in all the german government is sending the soviets 250000 
tons of food and other supplies by rail sea and air to help ward 
off shortages this winter 
organizers are seeking private donations from ordinary germans 
to back the relief efforts some germans have even taken to the 
streets with tin cans seeking contributions for the soviets from 
passersby in potsdam 
a telethon on germanys zdf television has helped to raise 21 
million dollars to date while companies are rushing to take part 
in the relief program 
some of the biggest contributions will come from the berlin 
reserves which were stockpiled with the aim of feeding west 
berliners for several months in case of another blockade like that 
off 1981949 when the soviets tried to choke off the city 
the stockpiles of food and other supplies are being given to the 
soviets free of charge 
andreas schuldenzucker of the government press office said 
friday that the berlin food reserves alone total 214500 tons all 
of it is being sent to the soviet union she said 
shaking off freezing temperatures soviet soldiers and german 
workers began loading 100 tons of powdered milk onto red army 
trucks before sunrise friday 
the trucks bore the familiar red star and the initials ca 
the russian alphabet abbreviation for soviet army 
clearly emblazoned on the sacks of powdered milk were the words 
made in the federal republic of germany 
escorted by german police and army personnel the first convoy 
of 16 trucks then drove to a soviet military airfield about 20 
miles south of berlin 
there the cargo was loaded onto planes for the flight to the 
soviet union kremlin officials have said they badly need the 
powdered milk 
the soviets themselves will transport the goods by rail sea and 
air although the german military will make six flights later this 
month 
the germans are predicting that their humanitarian mission for 
the soviets will continue at full pace despite some questions as 
to the true extent of shortages in the soviet union 
a civic group has also urged eastern germans to invite soviet 
soldiers to spend christmas with them to promote better relations 
between the two sides 
there are still an estimated 360000 soviet troops stationed in 
former east germany they are to be pulled out by 1994

a state appeals court upheld a 
lifewithoutparole murder sentence for a vietnam veteran who lost 
his legs in the war saying it had sympathy for his wounds but 
could not excuse his killing of a policeman 
most severely wounded vietnam veterans have managed to deal 
with their anguish without committing murder the courts 
presiding judge clinton white said in a ruling thursday 
stanley verketis who lost both legs in a land mine in 1968 
returned home suffering from drastic personality changes and became 
addicted to heroin and alcohol according to testimony at his 
trial 
he was convicted of fatally shooting police officer arthur koch 
who had responded to a report of gunfire at verketis home in 
fairfield northeast of san francisco in july 1984 
at his appeal the defense argued that a life sentence was cruel 
and unusual punishment because of verketis background 
the 1st district court of appeal agreed that verketis would not 
have been waiting for the officer with a gun had he not suffered a 
lifetransforming injury but said that fact did not make the 
sentence disproportionate to the crime 
to that extent we feel sympathy for verketis because he 
was in fact the victim of events beyond his control white said 
in the 30 decision 
white said the same argument could be made for black criminals 
from the inner city that they are victims of poverty and racism 
he said societys responsibility for those conditions would not 
make an otherwise valid sentence cruel and unusual punishment

the united states is speeding up millions of 
dollars in military aid to el salvador to help fight off attacks by 
guerillas who have acquired sophisticated sovietmade missiles and 
used them to shoot down two salvadoran warplanes the state 
department said friday 
administration officials said a spent canister from a 
sovietmade a14 surfacetoair missile has been found near the 
area where one of the aircraft was destroyed 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said the 
481 million in aid will allow the salvadoran government to 
replace equipment including aircraft damaged or destroyed in the 
guerilla attacks that began nov 20 
the attacks have caused some 500 casualties in seven of the 
countrys 14 provinces the department said 
the administration officials speaking on condition they not be 
named said the guerillas used a soviet missile to shoot down a 
salvadoran a37 fighter bomber nov 23 
a guerilla missile brought down an ac47 fixedwing gun ship on 
dec 4 they said 
the officials said it had been known at the time of a guerilla 
offensive last year that the rebels had received a7 surfacetoair 
missiles and possibly americanmade redeye missiles as well 
the officials said they now have evidence that the guerillas 
have obtained and are using computerguided a14 missiles a weapon 
with longer range and greater capability than the a7 
it would appear that the fmln guerillas have recently 
introduced into el salvador a new very sophisticated generation of 
surfacetoair missiles one official said referring to the a14 
the officials said a canister from a soviet missile has been 
found in approximately the same location in eastern el salvador 
where the a37 was shot down 
an official said the canister was sovietmade 
he said a14 missiles are known to exist in the western 
hemisphere only in the arsenals of cuba and those still maintained 
by nicaraguas sandinistas 
salvadoran forces discovered 24 sa7 missiles and one us 
redeye on a cessna aircraft that crashed in el salvador last year 
the official said that flight was organized by cuba and the 
sandinistas he said the redeye could have been captured by the 
sandinistas from the nowdisbanded contra resistance forces inside 
nicaragua 
he noted that the salvadoran guerillas recently have claimed 
that they now possess a7 a14 and redeye missiles 
we have information arms shipments do continue from nicaragua 
both by land and by sea the official said 
but he said he is confident they are being organized without the 
assistance or knowledge of nicaraguas democratically elected 
president violeta chamorro 
and he said that hundreds of the a14 missiles are known to be 
in arsenals still controlled by the sandinistas 
of the 481 million total in aid 106 million will come from 
money left from the 81 million congress appropriated for the 
salvadoran armed forces in fiscal 1990 the remaining 375 million 
will be drawn from the 85 million appropriated for fiscal 1991 
under conditions imposed by congress the final 50 percent of 
the 1991 appropriation can be released only if the guerillas 
undertake an offensive that threatens the survival of the 
salvadoran government 
the department spokeswoman said that secretary of state james a 
baker iii has approved accelerated disbursement of fiscal year 
1991 military assistance to help the government of el salvador face 
the serious new escalation in fmln guerilla offensive actions some 
military assistance funds remaining from fiscal year 1990 also will 
be disbursed

main rival the african national congress of nelson mandela 
factional fighting between supporters of the two groups has killed 
nearly 1000 people in the johannesburg townships since august 
there are nonviolent democratic means of achieving results 
which no boycott action will ever achieve said a statement from

us defense secretary dick cheney 
asked the nato allies on friday to send combat troops to the 
persian gulf and make more ships and planes available for 
transporting american troops and weaponry 
he said iraqs decision to free all foreign hostages will not 
alter plans for increasing the us deployment in the gulf to more 
than 400000 troops over the next few weeks 
we dont think iraqi president saddam hussein deserves any 
praise cheney said after a twoday meeting of the nato defense 
ministers 
the meeting reaffirmed natos pledge to continue work on a 
postcold war defense strategy based on a reduced us presence in 
europe smaller and more integrated forces and a continued mix of 
conventional and nuclear arms 
our future force posture will be based on smaller more mobile 
and flexible active forces able to respond to aggression from any 
quarter the ministers said in a communique 
they said the gulf crisis was an example of the continuing 
risks of aggression from outside nato territory that affect the 
allies vital security interests 
the gulf crisis figured prominently in the talks at nato 
headquarters during which british defense secretary tom king also 
appealed for more logistical and combat help from the allies 
king said thursday he asked for ammunition medical equipment 
and staff and chemical warfare gear for britains gulf force 
which will soon total 30000 
although cheney did not mention a need for protective chemical 
warfare gear us officials cited such a need in comments to 
reporters 
cheney asked the allies for help in transporting americas 
massive flow of men and equipment to the gulf which includes 
about 100000 troops now stationed in europe 
he also urged them to send heavy combat troops and air 
defense forces 
if nations wish to commit more forces well be happy to 
have them cheney said but he stressed we are not dependent 
on that kind of assistance to get the job done 
he reported a generally favorable response but no immediate 
commitments 
the united states and 25 other nations have deployed troops in 
the persian gulf after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait a united 
nations resolution passed on nov 29 gave iraq until jan 15 to get 
out of kuwait or face military action 
the nato allies restated their goal of a full retreat from 
kuwait allowing saddam to partially withdraw was reminiscent of 
appeasement of dictators in the past cheney said 
to date all nato allies have contributed to the persian gulf 
effort with money troops or equipment

the assertive russian republic plans to make the 
ruble convertible on currency exchange markets in two years and 
promised new protection for foreign investors officials said 
friday 
the statements however offered little assurance the vast 
republic could carry out its proposals in the turbulent political 
climate that has nearly paralyzed power in the country the 
comments were made during a seminar on the russian economy 
the russian parliament also gave preliminary approval friday to 
a resolution on transition to a market economy but then became 
bogged down in debate on amendments the official news agency tass 
reported 
economy minister gennady filshin told participants at the 
seminar the ruble would be made convertible slowly in foreign 
exchange markets in order to avoid a sharp drop in value that 
would leave the us dollar the dominant currency tass reported 
he offered no other details of the plan at the seminar attended 
by financial experts and wouldbe investors 
the dollar already has become the currency of choice for a range 
of transactions from taxi rides to joint venture investments 
soviet officials have taken measures to try to boost the rubles 
value by outlawing foreign currency transactions to halt 
dollarization 
some of the 15 soviet republics also have said they want to 
create their own convertible currencies as part of their drives for 
independence 
participants at the conference expressed doubt that even russia 
the largest republic with 90 percent of the countrys energy 
resources could sustain a convertible ruble on its own tass 
reported 
russias justice minister nikolai fyodorov also said the 
republics parliament will begin debate soon on a bill to equalize 
foreign and soviet business under russian law remove limits on 
foreign business activity in russia and allow foreign capital to 
be brought freely in and out of russia 
taxation and customs privileges will be granted to enterprises 
with 100 percent foreign holdings and joint ventures that are ready 
to reinvest or invest in economically backward regions of 
russia fyodorov said according to tass 
he said 30000 revenue inspectors would be hired to make 
sure taxes are paid by the emerging private sector businesses

demonstrations popov will head a transition government until 
elections next summer 
his election by the 400seat grand national assembly settled the 
lingering question over who would run the country 
parliament ordered him to present his government to the chamber 
within seven days meanwhile foodstuffs and electricity are 
rationed many other everyday needs are in very short supply 
the government announced last spring that it was unable to 
service the countrys 11 billion foreign debt and has been seeking 
assistance from the west 
since lukanovs resignation bulgaria has been run by lukanovs 
socialist government of former communists on a caretaker basis 
my activity resembles a painful operation in order to save a 
state and a people said popov who helped run bulgarias first 
free elections in june this is an attempt at a strong government 
of professionals and politicians 
popov also told parliament he was accepting the job provided he 
gets broad support from legislators and the public 
assembly chairman nikolai todorov announced popov was elected by 
a large majority but did not give the number of assembly 
deputies who voted for him he said 15 deputies voted against popov 
and 29 abstained 
his unexpected appointment came after ginyu ganev the deputy 
chairman of parliament refused the post sources said that todor 
valchev an economics professor also had turned it down 
we must all realize that the issue of political power is not 
the most important one but that of whether bulgaria can 
survive said alexander tomov deputy chairman of the socialist 
party 
dimitar popov is a suitable candidate both as a personality 
and as a neutral figure lukanov said 
he lauded popov as a man with character who has shown in 
complicated situations that he can be nonpartisan and objective 
popov the son of an orthodox priest was born in the northern 
bulgarian city of kula he studied law and worked for 35 years as a 
lawyer for transport companies and later as a judge 
i am neutral as regards my nonmembership in a political 
force but i am strongly committed to the ideals of democracy 
popov said 
i appeal to all political forces and labor unions to support 
this future government within the framework of the political 
agreement that has to be signed within the next few days zhelev 
told deputies 
he referred to an accord being negotiated under his auspices to 
establish a transitional government set a timetable for future 
legislative work and the drafting of a new constitution 
but in his speech zhelev introduced the new premier without a 
word on his qualifications rather he heaped praise on the 
outgoing lukanov 
andrei lukanov stepped down not because he did not have the 
necessary qualities of a politician he said he is one of 
bulgarias most capable politicians and the most outstanding one in 
his party 
his political drama is not of a personal nature it is the 
drama of a political party doomed to separate from state power 
the president said 
he also said that politicians of lukanovs caliber and 
abilities must not disappear from the political life of the 
country his knowledge relations and know how are necessary for 
the country bulgaria does not have so many capable politicians 
but analysts said lukanov was unlikely to join popovs cabinet 
zhelev had tried hard to set up a coalition government under 
lukanov but the union of democratic forces the main opposition 
alliance rejected it the alliance asserted that lukanov was 
compromised by his communist past 
the union of democratic forces was shaken this week by 
revelations that its chairman petar beron was a police informer 
under the former regime of communist dictator todor zhivkov 
berons resignation was accepted thursday he admitted he 
informed on foreign visitors while working at the natural history 
museum but beron said he reported to a department other than the 
dreaded domestic secret police

us and filipino officials ended a 
third round of talks on the future of us military bases friday 
without agreeing on the extent to which philippine laws should 
apply to the facilities 
both sides understand the importance of satisfactorily 
addressing this vital component of the prospective bilateral 
defense relationship a joint statement said 
any agreement entered into by both sides will fully reflect 
philippine sovereignty as well as the full measure of equality and 
partnership the us has with its other allies and partners 
around the world the statement added 
the united states controls clark air base and subic bay naval 
base which are among the largest american overseas military 
facilities and four smaller installations under an agreement that 
expires in september 1991 a new treaty is required to keep the 
facilities after that 
philippine panel spokesman rafael alunan said discussions on the 
status of forces agreement which defines the extent to which 
philippine laws apply to the bases will continue in january 
us chief negotiator richard armitage left manila friday 
shortly after the latest round of talks with filipino officials led 
by foreign secretary raul manglapus 
manglapus has said the philippines will take over clark and the 
four minor facilities after 1991 but will allow continued american 
access on a commercial basis he said the philippines was open to 
extending the us stay at subic bay for five to seven years 
manila has insisted that philippine laws be applied to the bases 
in economic areas such as tariffs income taxes duties and 
licenses and wants criminal jurisdiction over the us servicemen 
there but this has met with stiff resistance by the americans 
us spokesman stanley schrager stressed that the united states 
does not intend to disregard philippine laws particularly those 
concerning criminal charges against any us service member he 
said the united states has arrangements with more than 30 other 
countries ensuring that us base personnel facing charges do not 
escape prosecution 
schrager said that although the decadesold alliance between the 
united states and the philippines had served both countries well 
the united states accepts that the new relationship is not going 
to be the status quo 
alunan said the philippines a former us colony wants to 
continue the alliance with the united states but without the 
vestiges of our colonial past 
we would like to ensure that the united states respects 
philippine laws and until such time that we are satisfied that 
they will be in fact respecting philippine laws which we equate to 
respecting philippine sovereignty ten i dont think we can ever 
sign a treaty alunan said 
a new treaty on the bases has to be approved by twothirds of 
the 23member philippine senate 
a recent poll of senate leaders showed at least 12 opposed a 
continued us presence on the bases enough to vote down a 
proposed treaty 
critics claim a continuing us presence is an affront to 
philippine sovereignty

hardline lawmakers who want to take emergency 
control of the country met with legislative leaders friday but a 
powerful rightwing politician called the meeting unconstitutional 
and boycotted it news reports said 
the organizer of the meeting in the kremlin played down any 
serious divisions indicating he hopes the increasingly assertive 
hardline politicians can be unified in the fractious political 
climate enveloping the country 
in a separate development a lawmaker reportedly said his 
faction would demand that parliamentarians vote on the 
professional aptitude of foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
for supporting the possible use of force against iraq 
five groups making up the selfdeclared national salvation 
committee met in the kremlin on friday with chairmen of both 
chambers of the national supreme soviet legislature 
the leaders had been expected to discuss the committees call 
this week for a nationwide state of emergency suspension of new 
political parties and transfer of control to the committee itself 
according to an agenda carried earlier by the independent news 
agency interfax 
the meeting was closed to reporters and no other details were 
immediately available 
vladimir voronin a leader of an umbrella organization of 20 
groups called the centrist bloc of the national parliament also 
had said president mikhail s gorbachev is willing to meet with 
the lawmakers later interfax reported it gave no other details 
the meeting with the national salvation committee in the kremlin 
was held without a leading member of the centrist bloc the 
soyuz group of parliamentarians the group claims about 500 
members in the 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
victor alksnis leader of soyuz called the selfdeclared 
committee unconstitutional and refused to take part in its meeting 
friday according to interfax and the state news agency tass 
instead alksnis reiterated his call for the central government 
to take extraordinary measures to halt the fragmentation of the 
country 
the logic of the recent developments is really bringing home 
to us the need of creating an extremely strong authority with the 
broadest possible powers he said according to tass 
however i believe that this authority should be created in a 
constitutional way alksnis told tass otherwise its creation 
will mean the usurping of power by political groups which do not 
represent the nation 
voronin organizer of the meeting acknowledged the differences 
with alksnis but said in a telephone interview his attitude toward 
alksnis was definitely positive and he hoped for cooperation 
alksnis said last week that he will call for a vote of no 
confidence in gorbachev if the president fails to show concrete 
progress on his plan to hold the country together with a new union 
treaty 
the country is riven by autonomyminded republics independence 
movements and a crumbling economy 
also friday a lawmaker identified as col nikolai petrushenko 
was quoted by the independent news agency postfactum saying that 
soyuz would demand parliamentarians take the vote on shevardnadze 
petrushenko reportedly criticized the soviet union for taking a 
proamerican course in voting in the united nations to 
authorize the use of force to eject iraq from kuwait 
however it was not clear if he spoke for the group

the mother was sentenced thursday to 15 years for complicity 
the victims now aged 17 20 and 23 conceived 10 times the 
mother took them for abortions each time the prosecutor said 
i suffered as well i cant say i suffered as much as my 
daughters the father 43 told the judge for me to do 
something like this to someone i love is like sticking knives and 
daggers into my own body 
i would hope justice in my case would be tempered by some 
mercy he told baltimore circuit court judge kenneth lavon 
johnson

daughters

45 years for child abuse all but 30 years were suspended

counts of child sexual abuse to avoid a trial on 30 counts of rape 
and child sexual abuse

identities 
the judge said he was unswayed by letters from the daughters 
who asked that he receive less than 30 years 
the acts of the defendant the father are so perverted so 
vile and so inhumane it requires the response of the law to the 
full extent johnson said 
the two oldest girls are children of the mother from a previous 
marriage the youngest is a child of both parents none testified 
friday 
the mans wife who described the family as very close very 
religious brought the girls to him and he raped them assistant 
states attorney wanda keyes robinson said the mother feigned 
sleep or faced the wall while the daughters screamed and fought 
their father robinson said 
the mother 43 pleaded guilty oct 29 to three counts of 
firstdegree rape and three counts of sexual child abuse under 
maryland law a person who helps someone else commit a felony can 
be charged as if the person committed the crime 
the abuse which began in 1981 remained a family secret until 
march when the youngest victim wrote at the bottom of a history 
test i hate life i hate school i hate people i hope to die 
soon 
social workers were notified and the father confessed two days 
later 
in a letter to her eldest daughter the mother said she 
justified her complicity by saying that the children had two 
parents were succeeding in school and neighbors and school

state television showing tearstreaked faces and 
ramshackle tents said friday on the anniversary of the 1988 
armenian earthquake that thousands of armenians remain homeless 
despite government promises of help 
we didnt fulfill our duty a somber correspondent reported 
from armenia on the national nightly newscast vemya 
panning across whole blocks of idle construction equipment and 
tent cities the correspondent described the failed rebuilding 
effort after the quake that killed 25000 he stopped short of 
outright criticism of the government on its own national newscast 
the 2yearold state program for restoring the area of the 
earthquake is frustrated completely only a few have received new 
apartments and thousands of others are doomed to spend their third 
winter in tents and railway cars said the correspondent 
identified only as an armenian 
hundreds of people some crying and most appearing sullen were 
shown gathering in a central square in yerevan the capital to 
honor the dead as bells tolled between 11 am and noon to mark the 
earthquake the first shock had hit at 1141 am exactly two years 
ago 
the earthquake measuring 69 on the richter scale immediately 
leveled hundreds of prefabricated apartment buildings and trapped 
tens of thousands of people under tons of rubble homes of 500000 
people were destroyed 
top government leaders including president mikhail s gorbachev 
and prime minister nikolai ryzhkov made widely publicized trips to 
the devastated areas and promised a sweeping rebuilding campaign 
but two years later only about 2533 percent of the damaged homes 
and buildings have been rebuilt soviet media reported 
two years to restore the house was only a promise made from 
the bottom of our hearts but still a promise the correspondent 
narrated 
the newscast showed concretes blocks apparently intended for 
new housing standing in piles on the sides of pits poorly clad 
people were shown lifting corrugated steel onto the top of tents to 
use as roofs 
to this national grief is added todays troubles empty 
shelves said eduard shaknazaryan of the armenpress news service 
referring to the worsening soviet economy 
there is nothing in the shops but bread and mineral water 
shaknazaryan said despite a system of rationing food is difficult 
and expensive to obtain in the capital of yerevan he said with a 
threehour wait in line for milk no eggs for sale and a chicken 
at private markets costing about 13 or about onetenth of a 
months salary 
church bells tolled friday across armenia calling survivors 
back to their ruined homes to lay flowers and mourning wreaths on 
the anniversary of the earthquake 
in the villages of leninakan and spitak which were hit hardest 
by the quake memorial services were held to remember the hour when 
disaster struck shaknazaryan said relatives of those killed 
returned to the villages to place flowers or wreaths at the sites 
where loved ones died 
mourners reflected grimly that friday was brilliant and sunny 
the same weather as when the quake hit 
the communist party newspaper pravda sent four reporters across 
the republic to survey the lingering effects of the quake and they 
came back with grim findings 
during our present tour of armenia we have come to see for 
ourselves once again that it is impossible to write about the 
revival of life in the quakeflattened land with cold 
rationality they wrote in fridays editions the tragedy of 
armenia is still felt 
in spitak where virtually every house was destroyed and 48000 
people were homeless only 46 percent of the planned reconstruction 
has been completed pravda quoted communist party official sergei 
grigoryan as saying 
only 78 percent of the planned housing has been rebuilt in 
leninakan where 120000 lost their homes pravda said 
the newspaper respublik armenia published an invitation for 
gorbachev and ryzhkov to return to armenia on the anniversary to 
ee the status of the reconstruction effort but neither went to 
the republic 
armenian construction minister gagik martirosyan said the 
rebuilding was hampered by difficulties with supplies of material 
and equipment as well as the increased political and social 
tension in the region 
the tv correspondent said more than 300000 people were flooding 
into armenia from neighboring azerbaijan to escape ethnic problems 
there 
armenia has been embroiled in a bitter ethnic conflict with 
adjacent azerbaijan which has blocked railways to its neighbor 
meanwhile the governments childrens fund chose friday to 
bestow its honorary leo tolstoy award on mother teresa the 
missionary who came to armenia after the quake to help its victims

the western hostages in iraq may have to wait a 
bit longer for the beginning of the final airlift and for the 
bubbly to celebrate it 
a british airways jet stocked with chilled champagne took off 
friday bound for baghdad the iraqi capital to begin the exodus of 
remaining hostages promised by president saddam hussein 
but the plane got stuck en route in jordan after confusion arose 
over its clearance rights to land in iraq 
the british airways flight was being closely watched by other 
nations hoping to send planes to evacuate their trapped citizens 
iraqs civil aviation authorities gave clearance a british 
airways spokesman said but the airline kept the flight in amman 
because a news report from iraq quoted an unidentified official as 
saying permission had been denied 
a british airways spokesman said iraqi civil aviation 
authorities had given permission for the plane to land in baghdad 
in light of what is being reported well put the plane in 
amman until the situation is clarified the british airways 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity weve received no 
official notification of a denial 
were in touch with the foreign office and asking them to 
press for a reconfirmation of the landing permit he said 
iraqs parliament on friday confirmed saddam husseins decision 
to release about 8000 westerners east european and japanese 
hostages who have been held since the persian gulf crisis began 
with the kuwaiti invasion of aug 2 
iraq said westerners would be free to leave starting saturday 
and could apply for exit permits immediately 
japan denmark and italy prepared flights to carry citizens 
home the dutch reportedly were readying an airbus jet to fly to 
baghdad on tuesday to pick up some of the 133 dutch nationals 
remaining in iraq and occupied kuwait 
switzerland and norway also were arranging flights to bring home 
seven swiss and five norwegians from iraq 
in new york pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said the us 
state department had inquired about available planes 
were still looking into that december is a busy travel 
season but we would of course do whatever possible she said 
the us state department said contingency plans had been made 
to charter aircraft but that nothing was scheduled until specifics 
about the release were known officials said they asked iraq to 
waive exit visa requirements for the 900 us citizens and other 
hostages held 
the british foreign office also was pressing iraqi authorities 
to expedite departures and also were having problem getting 
details 
the foreign office on friday warned britons hiding in kuwait to 
stay put until departure logistics were clear a similar message 
was broadcast in the region over voice of america on thursday 
the iraqis said friday that the release offer was genuine a 
spokesman at the iraqi embassy in london said all hostages had 
the right to leave immediately regardless of whether they were 
in hiding or being detained 
the spokesman said on condition of anonymity that iraq had 
decided to release the hostages because the holy festival of 
christmastime is coming and we feel that people should be with 
their families 
hoping to ferry some of this christmas spirit the british 
airways flight carried 400 christmas cakes 400 bottles of 
champagne and 200 clean sweatsuits 
i should think that the atmosphere on board on the way home 
will be euphoric to say the least said gil gray pilot of the 
flight 
british airways said the airlift of britons would be boosted by 
other aircraft if needed virgin atlantic also planned to send an

rebels last weekend hopes to find refuge in the united states his 
entourage reported friday 
but hissene habre would like to remain in yaounde as long as 
possible while searching for a country to grant him permanent 
asylum the sources said 
a us embassy spokesman in yaounde reported friday that habre 
had not been in contact with its diplomats to request asylum and 
referred further queries to the state department in washington 
habre 48 has reportedly been negotiating asylum in zaire but 
members of his entourage report that he would ultimately like to 
take up residence in the united states

saddam hussein has deployed some of the 
seven new army divisions he said he was forming to reinforce his 
troops in and near kuwait arab sources said friday 
also friday iraqs defense ministry ordered all reservist 
farmers to report to their military units starting dec 17 it said 
those who dont will be listed as deserters and risk execution 
the announcement on state radio came as us military officials 
reported a steady buildup of iraqi troops in occupied kuwait 
the developments indicated saddam has no plans to relinquish 
kuwait despite upcoming talks with us leaders and his 
announcement that all hostages will be free to leave 
the arab sources speaking on condition of anoynmity said it 
was not known whether the seven new divisions drawn mainly from 
the reserves were in kuwait or have joined the iraqi strategic 
reserve force in southern iraq that force includes saddams best 
troops 120000 of the elite republican guards 
an iraqi division usually has around 12000 members 
pentagon spokesman bob hall said thursday that 30000 additional 
iraqi troops detected in or near kuwait in the last week had been 
moved there from the iranian border 
he estimated iraqi forces in the area at 480000 with 2700 
artillery guns and 4000 of saddams 5500 tanks 
saddam has been reducing his divisions on the 730mile iranian 
frontier since midaugust when he agreed to tehrans demands for a 
peace treaty to formally end the 198088 iraniraq war 
the iraqi leader announced last month that he was forming the 
new army divisions and mobilizing another 150000 reservists to 
strengthen his force in the emirate iraq conquered aug 2 
saddam said they included 60000 farmers who had been 
demobilized to boost food production because of the un embargo 
imposed on iraq with the harvest season over he said those men 
were now eligible for mobilization 
the defense ministry announcement said the farmer reservists 
have three days from dec 17 to report in or be listed as 
deserters in iraq deserters are executed 
thousands of the reported 100000 men who deserted during the 
198088 iraniraq war were shot by firing squad often in front of 
their families and neighbors 
saddams move to beef up his forces was in apparent response to 
a new deployment by us forces in the gulf 
more than 250000 american soldiers are now in the gulf as part 
of a multinational force arrayed against iraq by midjanuary 
200000 more troops will be in the region to boost us strength to 
around 450000 
the un security council has passed a resolution authorizing 
the use of force to drive the iraqis out of kuwait if they do not 
leave by jan 15 
the iraqis have built a formidable threelayer defensive system 
along kuwaits coastline and along the saudi border 
they have been reported to be extending that defensive line 
westward from the kuwaiti border 
the us commander in saudi arabia gen h norman schwarzkopf 
said early this month that the iraqis have apparently positioned 
their least capable troops in the first of the three defensive 
layers 
youve got the worst troops forward he said this force 
doesnt have very much will to do much of anything the second 
level of troops are better i think youve got the best troops 
all the way to the rear 
i think that theyre arrayed that way for the reason they 
theyd like us to take them headon dissipate our force as we go 
through each belt and when were considerably weakened the 
strongest force would hit us 
an 11000member us marine amphibious force in the gulf has 
been conducting landing exercises in preparation for a possible 
seaborne attack on kuwait from the east 
that would presumably be launched simultaneously with sustained 
air strikes and a ground offensive from the south

to operate as antilibyan commandos 
agence francepress the french news agency reported that 200 
libyan pows were evacuated from ndjamena on friday aboard a us

the united states was assisting a number of libyan pows who did not 
wish to return to libya she said she could not comment further 
according to afp the libyans who received commando training 
initially agreed to assist the chadian army later they reportedly 
were placed under the command of a libyan colonel and given 
commando training at a camp near ndjamena chads capital 
afp quoted unidentified sources as saying the commandos had laid 
mines and staged some attacks in southern libya in recent months 
after habres ouster a week ago by the forces of rebel leader 
idriss deby a delegation of libyan officials flew into ndjamena 
they arranged for the bulk of the libyan pows to return to libya 
and reportedly sought to obtain custody of those who turned against 
the government of col moammar gadhafi 
libyan television reported friday that the pows who came home 
were greeted with festivities at the tripoli airport 
rebel leader deby has been installed as interim president and 
habre has taken refuge in cameroon

a jury friday found soldier of fortune 
magazine liable for 124 million in damages for running a gun 
for hire ad blamed for the 1985 killing of a businessman 
robert brown the magazines founder and publisher said he 
would appeal the award to the slain mans two sons im not 
surprised by the verdict he said i think well see it 
overturned on appeal 
steve glassroth a lawyer for the sons of richard braun said 
the judgment by the us district court jury sent a warning that 
publishers have to exercise a measure of responsibility when 
dealing with an ad of this nature 
attorneys for the magazine had argued in the first amendment 
case that the publication should not be held liable and that 
publishers have no duty to research the background of their 
advertisers 
the lawsuit was the second such case against the magazine to go 
to trial in the previous trial seeking damages in a womans 
slaying in 1985 a jury in houston returned a 94 million verdict 
that award was reversed on appeal last year and the us supreme 
court let the decision stand 
in the alabama lawsuit the jury heard 4 days of testimony 
before deliberating for just two hours friday 
brothers michael 21 and ian braun 26 both of montgomery 
blamed their fathers death on a gun for hire classified ad in 
the magazines june 1985 issue by richard savage of knoxville 
tenn the brauns contended their fathers business associate bruce 
gastwirth used the ad to arrange to have braun killed 
michael then 16 was wounded in the aug 27 1985 attack in 
the familys driveway in atlanta 
the jury awarded 104 million to michael braun and 2 million 
to the brothers jointly 
ian braun said the verdict would never undo the emotional damage 
to his brother who he said is afraid to express emotion to family 
members since seeing his father killed 
brown was certainly within his right to publish his magazine 
but what goes in youve got to be responsible for ian braun 
said 
michael braun declined to comment 
savages classified ad read gun for hire 37yearold 
professional mercenary desires jobs vietnam veteran discrete and 
very private body guard courier and other special skills all 
jobs considered 
in 1986 the magazine stopped running such ads 
gastwirth savage and two associates were convicted of brauns 
killing savage already had been convicted in a similar 
murderforhire case in west palm beach fla as well as several 
attempted assassinations that went awry they are now serving 
prison sentences 
in closing arguments defense attorney jim garrett told the 
jury a publisher has no duty to investigate every advertiser 
but if the magazine had checked savage it would have found he 
served in vietnam and was a courier under gen william 
westmoreland 
trial testimony showed savage had no felony police record when 
he placed the ad and garrett said the ad did not contain a 
clearly identifiable risk that it is an offer to commit murder 
a braun family attorney steve glassroth said soldier of 
fortune should have been aware of news stories about a series of 
unrelated crimes in the early 1980s tied to its classified ads 
those stories should have stopped the magazine from running the 
personal services ads long before 1986 
brown denied seeing any of those stories he said he ran the ads 
to help vietnam veterans find jobs using their military skills

convulsions from severe nerve gas exposure said cmdr thad 
zajdowicz the doctor in charge of readiness and training for

slightly higher dosage than given to patients in order to calm 
anxiety said zajdowicz of norfolk va 
the intent of the distribution will be that it will be carried 
as personal protection by the individual soldier sailor or

the white house warned iraq friday 
theres no lessening in the threat of war even with release of 
american hostages 
but things are moving in the right direction said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater as president bush arrived 
on the last stop of his south american tour bush came to caracas 
to thank venezuela for easing this falls global oil crunch with 
increased production of crude 
fitzwater said the un vote authorizing military action against 
iraq forced this series of events it forced saddam hussein to 
make concrete changes 
iraq still must comply with united nations demands for its 
withdrawal from kuwait and fulfill all other conditions set forth 
by the world organization fitzwater said 
bush received a 21gun salute as he arrived in caracas for talks 
with president carlos andres perez 
as it has on each stop of his weeklong trip the persian gulf 
crisis overshadowed events the day 
iraqs parliament overwhelmingly endorsed saddam husseins order 
to release more than 8000 foreign hostages among them are 900 
americans 
we hope that some americans will be able to come out 
tomorrow fitzwater said 
yet fitzwater said the crisis had not eased 
theres no lessening in the threat of war he said that 
threat exists just as strong as ever 
on the hostages fitzwater said said the united states proposed 
to baghdad flying all americans out on planes chartered from iraqi 
airlines or from other companies the same way more than 2000 
other americans have departed iraq and kuwait 
as a backup the government has been checking on the 
availability of us airlines and charter planes he said 
fitzwater said he believed that all americans in kuwait had been 
accounted for and that the united states expects there will be no 
reprisals by iraq against anyone who hid americans in kuwait 
he expressed skepticism over iraqs motives in freeing the 
hostages 
they have concluded that the hostages no longer work for them 
and that the issue works against them he said 
he said baghdad in promising to release the hostages was 
trying to divide the global coalition against iraq and weaken the 
international will in the gulf 
caracas was the last stop on a weeklong tour to salute the 
emergence of democracy and economic reforms throughout the region 
as in chile where guerrillas set off halfadozen bombs and 
police teargassed antibush student demonstrators bushs visit 
ignited traditional antiamerican sentiments 
army and national guard units took over the andean city of 
merida to prevent further violence from student protestors and 
eight people were injured in clashes between students and police in 
caracas late thursday several police officers were reported 
injred one seriously students also marched against the bush 
visit in maracaibo venezuelas second largest city and its oil 
center and in valencia 
toasting perez at a state dinner bush saluted the tide of 
democracy and economic reforms that have swept south america 
leaving cuba as the lonely totalitarian holdout in our 
hemisphere 
so we are close very close to a democratic hemisphere from 
alaska to argentina bush said this era of peaceful change 
came about in no small part because of the unwavering leadership 
and example of a democratic venezuela 
in his toast perez said our solidarity is firm against 
iraq 
he said venezuela supports the un decisions and steps taken by 
the united states to safeguard mankind from a catastrophic war 
caused by iraqs attempt to erase from the map a universally 
recognized state 
as he arrived in caracas from an overnight stop in chile bush 
expressed disappointment over the collapse of global trade 
negotiations in brussels 
bush blamed the collapse on the failure of the european 
community japan and korea to reduce farm subsidies and said he 
hoped they would reconsider and negotiate real marketopening 
agreements while there is still time to do so 
after iraq invaded kuwait perez joined with saudi arabia to 
lobby opec members to sustain production levels and stabilize 
prices and increased his own countrys output 20 percent to 24 
million barrels a day 
thats made a major contribution not just to our economy but 
particularly to energydependent economies in the developing 
world a senior administration official said of the efforts of 
venezuela and saudi arabia 
the price of oil has fluctuated wildly since august rising when 
persian gulf tensions increased and receding when peace prospects 
seemed to improve perez has called for talks among consumers and 
producers to see if a way can be found to stabilize prices 
officials said venezuela advocates creation of a hemispheric oil 
reserve for emergencies but that the united states has so far 
shown little interest in the idea 
during his presidency bush has developed a warm relationship 
with perez the trip to caracas marks the seventh time they have 
met the two leaders were holding talks before a state dinner and 
they were to meet again saturday before bush returns to washington 
in a speech to businessmen in santiago bush pledged that the 
events in eastern europe and elsewhere will not hamper us 
relations with latin america 
we are not going to neglect central or south america bush 
said this is our hemisphere 
bush told a gathering of the chileanamerican chamber of 
commerce that with the restoration of democratic rule in chile 
after 17 years of military government our two nations are united 
as never before 
he also said that economic reforms in chile have led to a surge 
in foreign investment here and even better times lie ahead the 
chilean example he added demonstrates that market forces are 
the way to prosperity

a federal judge on friday said the 
strikeplagued daily news could be sold by hawkers at subway and 
train stations for at least another 10 days 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum of manhattan continued 
her weekold order until dec 17 new york newsday and the new york 
post both applied to gain the same access and were awaiting an 
answer 
cedarbaum said the daily news had shown irreparable harm adding 
that its lawyers made a substantial showing that its first 
amendment rights would be violated if i did not continue the 
temporary restraining order 
the hearing was part of a lawsuit the daily news filed last week 
after the metropolitan transportation authority which operates the 
citys subway system and suburban commuter rail lines barred 
hawkers 
we are pleased with this ruling we are selling papers at 
over 100 locations in the transit system and the judge has today 
affirmed our right to continue to do so daily news vice 
president john sloan said 
the ruling drew an irate response from the transit authoritys 
unions which announced a monday meeting with news strike leader 
george mcdonald to determine a collective response 
we are angry and disgusted at the courts decision on the use 
of hawkers said sonny hall president of transport workers union 
local 100 well have a definitive plan of action to announce on 
monday 
the lawsuit claims the daily news depends on hawkers to 
distribute the paper in the transit system because virtually all 
newsstands there stopped carrying the paper after the oct 25 
strike cedarbaum agreed the hawkers were legal 
new york newsday renewed its request friday to place hawkers in 
the same stations where the news is allowed said spokeswoman 
chiara coletti the post did the same although spokesman gary lewi 
said the tabloid will not use hawkers where it already has 
newsstands handling the paper 
mta spokesman tito davila said the agency had not ruled on the 
newsday permits 
the daily news has published every day during the sixweek 
strike but distribution has been a major problem cutting 
circulation in half from the prestrike 109 million copies daily 
newsday and the post have made major circulation gains during the 
strike 
a transit authority lawyer susan weiner argued the daily news 
had alternative means to distribute the paper citing vending 
machines she said the mta revoked permits originally given to 
hawkers because of passenger safety concerns and the fear of 
service disruptions 
but news attorney herbert m wachtell dismissed weiners 
arguments as frivolous 
he claimed the mta rescinded the hawkers permits because of 
pressure from transit unions who threatened a work stoppage if 
hawkers were allowed to sell the paper 
in extending the temporary restraining order cedarbaum noted 
that the transit authority had not provided specific examples of 
violence or disruptions of service

the united states announced friday it will 
pull all diplomats out of its besieged embassy in kuwait once 
american hostages leave the occupied sheikdom the topranking us 
envoy in baghdad asked iraq to waive exit formalities to speed 
hostage departures 
the embassy in kuwait city cut off from food and water for 
months has been kept staffed in defiance of iraqi orders that all 
embassies there shut down and it will be considered officially 
open even after the eight diplomats leave said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
we will expect iraq to safeguard the premises until the 
legitimate government of kuwait and our embassy staff return she 
said 
us officials denied the decision was a concession to iraqi 
demands that all embassies in kuwait close this is a withdrawal 
in body not in spirit said one state department official our 
people there are humans not symbols were doing whats best for 
them 
on friday immediately after iraqs national assembly approved 
the dearture of more than 8000 foreigners from iraq and kuwait 
us envoy joseph wilson asked that americans be allowed to start 
leaving immediately on available commercial flights ms tutwiler 
said 
he urged the government of iraq to dispense with exit visa and 
passport formalities so that people do not encounter needless 
bureaucratic delays she said 
but iraqi foreign ministry officials told him they will only 
respond to the us requests on saturday she said they gave no 
reason she said but other officials noted that friday is islams 
sabbath and government offices are closed 
tutwiler said the state department was arranging for iraqi 
foreign minister tariq azizs visit probably on dec 17 but a 
date for his meeting with bush wont be set until iraq sets the 
date for a subsequent meeting between secretary of state james 
baker and president saddam hussein in baghdad she said she 
declined to explain why the administration was setting such a 
condition 
the united states proposed flying all the americans out on 
planes chartered from iraqi airlines or from other companies it has 
used before she said 
the main task of the diplomats in kuwait led by ambassador 
nathaniel howell was to keep in touch with americans and work for 
their safe release ms tutwiler said once that mission is 
accomplished and all americans who wish to leave kuwait do so 
the embassy will temporarily not be staffed because we would then 
have no business to do with the iraqi occupation forces 
the diplomats will remain accredited to the kuwaiti government 
exiled in saudi arabia 
two british diplomats have also been holding out at their own 
embassy in kuwait 
the foreign office in london said the two british diplomats 
would stay in kuwait regardless of the us withdrawal 
president bush has repeatedly expressed anger at the treatment 
of the us diplomats saying it violated international norms of 
diplomatic behavior 
they have been subsisting on meager rations with their water 
and electricity cut off and prevented by iraqi troops from leaving 
the compound 
the united nations security council adopted a resolution several 
weeks ago calling for the two embassies to be provided with food 
but the world body was unable to make arrangements for restocking 
the two missions 
as part of his proposal to the iraqi foreign ministry wilson 
urged that water and lights be turned on at the embassy in kuwait 
and the diplomats allowed to come and go freely so they can help in 
the evacuation operation tutwiler said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
interviewed by abc televisions nightline program the iraqi 
foreign minister said of the diplomats in kuwait if they leave 
they will be given all the guarantees they are asking for the 
building would be secure we take the responsibility for that 
you see 
as for americans who have been in hiding they can appear and 
leave aziz said 
he said iraq was still considering the state departments 
proposal that bakers visit to baghdad should take place on dec 
20 21 or 22 or else jan 3 
aziz repeated iraqs position that all middle east problems must 
be attacked together including the palestinian issue and said 
that if bush intends simply to explain un resolutions and us 
troop deployments to him then i think that thats not going to 
be a very useful meeting of course i will listen to him

lawyers in the murder case against 
marlon brandos son told a judge friday that the prosecutors star 
witness the actors daughter was ruled mentally incompetent by 
a court in tahiti 
prosecutors pressed on with efforts to get her testimony 
superior court judge joel rudof tentatively ruled that he would 
issue an international document requesting french assistance in 
returning cheyenne brando to the united states to testify in her 
brothers trial but rudof didnt make that ruling final and gave 
lawyers until dec 19 to file documents on the issue 
christian brando 32 is charged with firstdegree murder in the 
shooting of his sisters tahitian lover 26yearold dag drollet 
at marlon brandos mansion may 16 
later in the day christian brandos lawyer appeared in court 
without his client and said he was unaware the defendant had been 
ordered to appear for trial setting 
superior court judge robert thomas who was to preside at the 
murder trial ordered christian brando to be in court tuesday for 
the setting of a new trial date he said he was tentatively 
planning to start the trial jan 14 
outside court defense lawyer robert shapiro reiterated that he 
is eager to settle the case without a trial but indicated there 
has been no progress in that direction 
we are open to sitting down with the district attorney and 
discussing a fair resolution to the case that would be fair to 
christian fair to the prosecution and acceptable to the public 
shapiro said 
at the earlier hearing concerning cheyenne brando deputy 
district attorney steven barshop said that in her last court 
appearance in the french polynesian territory last september miss 
brando said she would be willing to return and testify if her 
doctors allowed it 
we are operating under the assumption that she will return 
voluntarily if she is subpoenaed barshop said 
attorney michael nasatir who is representing the 20yearold 
miss brando told the judge he was informed by lawyers in tahiti 
that she was placed under the guardianship of her mother tarita 
tarapia brando after a hearing in tahiti on thursday 
she has been declared incompetent to handle her own affairs 
and her child also has been put under guardianship nasatir said 
he suggested that she should not be ordered back to the united 
states because she is an unsuitable witness 
barshop meanwhile said he had no direct information yet on 
what had occurred in tahiti and wanted to press forward with the 
effort quickly to get christian brandos trial started 
the international tangle over miss brando has delayed the murder 
trial which was scheduled to start nov 5 
shortly after the shooting she returned to tahiti where she 
had drollets child was confined to a mental hospital and at one 
point was treated for a drug overdose according to the brando 
family 
there also was a report from a brando family spokesman in 
papeete in november that she tried to commit suicide by hanging and 
was hospitalized 
she has refused to return to california to testify 
authorities in tahiti also have barred her exit charging her as 
an accomplice in drollets slaying 
defense attorney robert shapiro maintains christian brando and 
drollet fought over a gun that accidentally went off he suggests 
drollets death was no more than involuntary manslaughter

a surgeon who died of aids continued to treat 
patients with breast cancer after learning he had the disease 
because he felt the good he did them outweighed the chance he could 
infect them his widow said 
dr rudolph almaraz a widely respected surgeon at johns hopkins 
died nov 16 of aids never telling his patients or the hospital of 
his illness 
the risks of infecting patients are minimal said his 
wife betty almaraz my husband saved many many lives weighted 
against the infinitesimal risk 
johns hopkins is sending letters to about 1800 patients on whom 
almaraz operated offering them aids testing and counseling but 
cautioning them that the chance of infection is very small 
the case also has prompted the hospital to consider supporting a 
new state law requiring health care workers to tell their 
supervisors or hospitals if they are infected with communicable 
diseases 
betty almaraz said her husband feared his loss of dignity his 
loss of practice if he revealed that he had aids but he 
consulted federal health officials and doctors who cared for him 
and followed their recommendations for continuing to practice 
safely 
he was concerned about creating mountains out of molehills 
he said there was no need to alarm these people 
almarazs lawyer marvin ellin has said the doctor got the 
disease during an operation on an aids patient at memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york city in 1983 the 
patients blood squirted into almarazs eyes and mouth ellin said 
the hospital says he never reported the exposure during the six 
months he was there 
aids is most commonly transmitted through homosexual contact 
the sharing of needles in intravenous drugs or in a blood 
transfusion 
betty almaraz said her husband didnt contract aids by any of 
those means

a newspaper reporter was handcuffed 
and taken to jail friday for refusing to answer certain questions 
about her interviews with a capital murder defendant 
the texas court of criminal appeal refused later in the day to 
consider an appeal and gave no explanation 
earlier an apologetic state district judge eric brown gave 
libby averyt of the corpus christi callertimes one last chance to 
answer the questions before he signed an order to jail her for 
contempt of court the 26yearold reporter again refused 
miss averyt it appears we are both actors playing our 
parts brown told the reporter before sheriffs deputies led her 
off to jail we are both doing our jobs 
brown ordered averyt jailed thursday but did not sign the order 
until friday the judge found her in contempt of court at a 
pretrial hearing in the murder trial of jermarr arnold 
ms averyt was found in contempt after she defied an ordered to 
testify instead she invoked the first amendment and similar 
provisions of the texas constitution in refusing 12 times to answer 
questions about her interviews with arnold in october and november 
averyt and the newspapers attorney jorge rangel maintained 
that journalists should not be compelled to reveal information 
obtained from news sources if that information was not published 
but brown said the rights of a man on trial for murder outweigh 
press privilege to withhold material 
attorneys for the newspaper were seeking to have ms averyt 
released on bond 
initially the judge ordered ms averyt placed in the custody of 
a bailiff in his court at the nueces county courthouse she was 
later moved to a county jail cell 
right now today im prepared to spend the weekend in jail 
ms averyt said after her appeal was refused i have not changed 
my mind about answering the questions i still have a strong 
belief that if this is allowed to happen then fewer people are 
going to talk to me 
nine media organizations opposed to the reporters jailing filed 
a friend of the court brief on her behalf friday at the 
criminal appeals court 
brown ordered ms averyt jailed indefinitely until she answers a 
defense attorneys questions about her interviews with arnold who 
faces trial in the 1983 slaying of 21yearold jewelry store clerk 
christina sanchez 
in ms averyts reports arnold discussed the robbery and 
slaying and expressed a lack of remorse his belief that he 
deserves the death penalty his previous criminal activity and told 
how he manipulated the insanity defense in previous trials for 
other crimes 
she conducted several interviews with arnold at the jail and 
over the telephone 
lewis said without ms averyts testimony the only way he could 
respond to the articles would be placing arnold on the stand that 
would violate arnolds fifth amendment right not to testify

homicide and illicit trafficking in drugs and weapons 
hull was also implicated in the 1984 assassination attempt 
against former contra leader eden pastora five journalists

a jury on friday awarded more than 35 
million to a man who sued roman catholic authorities saying he had 
been sexually abused by a priest when he was a boy 
the man who is now 24 was abused during his boyhood by the 
rev thomas adamson who was pastor at a church in the twin cities 
suburb of columbia heights according to undisputed testimony in 
the case 
the man and his parents filed suit against the roman catholic 
archdiocese in st paulminneapolis and the diocese in the 
southeastern minnesota city of winona the man has asked to remain 
anonymous 
the anoka county jury said the archdiocese of st 
paulminneapolis and the diocese of winona together were 85 percent 
negligent and the man and his parents were each 5 percent 
negligent 
jurors decided on punitive damages against the archdiocese of 2 
million and punitive damages against the winona diocese of 
700000 
the jury also decided on 855000 in compensatory damages for 
the victims past and future pain and disability embarrassment and 
emotional distress medical and therapy expenses and loss of 
earnings 
both the church bodies were deciding whether to appeal 
archbishop john roach said he was disappointed with the verdict 
the victim deserves some compensation but no punitive damages 
roach said 
in the case of punitive damages its very clear to me there 
will be an appeal roach said 
the plaintiff and his parents have alleged throughout the 
fiveweek trial that the archdiocese and the diocese showed willful 
indifference by failing to remove adamson from duty when they knew 
about adamsons 20year history of abusing boys 
church attorneys had admitted the archdiocese and diocese were 
partly responsible for the plaintiffs psychological problems but 
denied they willfully employed an unfit priest 
adamson had admitted sexual misconduct with boys in the winona 
diocese beginning in 1961 and in the twin cities archdiocese after 
his 1975 transfer 
the mans attorney jeffrey anderson had argued that adamsons 
longterm and frequent abuse of the plaintiff irrevocably twisted 
and distorted the plaintiffs emotional growth 
anderson asked for more than 2 million in damages to compensate 
the plaintiff he sought an additional 35 million dollars in 
punitive damages 
the plaintiff who was 13 when the abuse began cried as the 
verdict was read and was still tearyeyed as he left the courtroom 
when asked how he felt he replied nervous 
hes going through a vindication anderson said of his 
client now hes been told hes been vindicated having this over 
with will be very therapeutic 
anderson said the jury did what we asked to compensate our 
client and sent a message that this kind of action should 
stop 
he added i think the verdict sends a real significant message 
and im in no way disappointed 
roach the spiritual leader of an estimated 665000 roman 
catholics in the twin cities area said the awarding of punitive 
damages ignores the actions w took nearly a decade ago to 
prevent similar cases of abuse 
our decisions certainly did not represent either willful 
indifference or reckless employment roach said 
kevin mcdonough chancellor of the archdiocese said church 
leaders changed the way they screen candidates for the priesthood 
and have increased awareness of sexual abuse among priests

the university of vermont failed at an auction 
friday to keep a letter by ethan allen in the state 
the 38000 winning bid for the 1787 letter by the vermont 
patriot was made by a new york dealer for a private manuscript 
library in santa barbara calif a 10 percent commission brought 
the price to 41800 at christies 
montreal antiquarian book dealer helen kahn said she bid just 
over 30000 on the schools behalf but could not go higher 
we were quite disappointed she said we thought it 
belonged in vermont 
bart auerbach the new york dealer said he bought the 
manuscript for the karpeles manuscript library a private 
institution owned by dave karpeles the library is open to the 
public 
the letter had a presale catalog estimate of 15000 to 
20000 
the university raised as much as 15000 from individual 
collectors and small foundations in vermont to buy the letter in 
which allen discusses a possible trade agreement between 
independent vermont and canada 
vermont became part of the united states in 1791 allen had led 
the greem mountain boys in a famous raid on fort ticonderoga during 
the american revolution 
thelletter shows a blending of allens personal and public 
goals said kevin graffagnino curator of the vermont collection at 
the university 
because allen and his brother ira owned 300000 acres in 
franklin and chittenden counties the allens wanted to make sure 
vermont could trade timber and goods freely to the north he said 
allen encouraged trade concessions between vermont and canada 
because his land would rise greatly in value graffagnino said and 
also because that was what he thought was right for vermont 
in the letter allen makes it clear that vermont is an 
independent republic and thus is free to make its own international 
decisions 
i belong to this republic which is not connected with the 
united states of america allen wrote to guy carleton lord 
dorchester former british military leader and britains governor 
of quebec at the time 
the british never did give the trade concessions and the allens 
fell into debt with montreal businessmen 
the university has the most extensive collection of allen papers 
in the world and officials were eager to buy the document and have 
it on display for the states bicentennial next year 
the university this year paid 13000 for a letter allen wrote 
in 1775

washington ap given saddam husseins record the bush 
administration is offering a subdued response to baghdads surprise 
announcement that all 900 americans held in iraq and kuwait will be

made of the iraqi president since his lightning takeover of kuwait 
in august president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
still insist on fulfillment of the other two a total withdrawal 
and restoration of the overthrown kuwaiti government 
freeing the hostages including 88 held as human shields at 
strategic locations could serve saddams purposes by contributing

the formula used to distribute federal health 
care money for the needy underpays poor states while favoring 
richer ones the general accounting office said today 
the congressional investigative agency in testimony prepared 
for a house panel said the government should replace the per

minimum federal share 
the formula does not target most federal funds to states with

concentrations of poor people the gaos janet shikles told the 
government operations subcommittee on human resources and

not all cities had increased killings but the number of

total by 3 percent and the year is not yet over police in those 
20 cities have recorded 7698 homicides so far this year

on a brisk fall weekend thousands of people 
streamed up a stone stairway to a 350yearold tomb honoring the 
man who far more than microchips or management systems created 
modern japan 
the tomb of shogun ieyasu tokugawa and a goldencrusted shrine 
sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of tokyo the shogun was 
promoted in death from man to god and is known as gongensama 
protector of the realm 
for many visitors the journey may be just an opportunity to 
view the autumn foliage but another impulse sends even retired 
people and young couples with toddlers up the 530foot stairway 
wherever you go in japan theres evidence of the tokugawa 
era so a lot of people are curious to see this place said 
tsuchiyasu kiyomitsu a 30yearold businessman who rested as other 
visitors rang a longcorded bell and paid obeisance 
the bigbellied shogun was a warlord of legendary willpower who 
completed the unification of japan in 1600 and virtually cut it off 
from the world 
japans isolation lasted 268 years and the family dynasty he 
founded deified tokugawa after his death to help legitimize itself 
during the long period of isolation japan created its own brand 
of capitalism including the worlds first futures market in 
rice it also refined the group behavior that still distinguishes 
japanese society scholars say 
under the tokugawas japan began evolving the paternalistic 
protectedmarket economy that has confounded policy makers in 
washington inspired japanbashing around the world and helped make 
the small archipelago very rich 
not surprisingly for japan where families routinely trace their 
ancestry back for centuries the tokugawa legacy exists in the 
flesh as well as in folklore 
had the dynasty not been overthrown in 1868 the man who might 
be shogun today is tsunenari tokugawa 50 current head of the 
family he manages north american operations for nippon yusen a 
tokyobased shipping company 
basically everything that you call japanese our weaknesses 
and our strong points many of them in a sense matured in this 
260year period he told an interviewer in his tokyo office 
maybe we matured too strongly he added with a smile 
referring to international criticism of japans economic practices 
tsunenari tokugawa a child of postwar egalitarian japan gave 
an embarrassed laugh about his aristocratic lineage and pointed out 
that he goes to work every day like any other salaryman 
the executive whose wide eyes and broad face resemble portraits 
of ieyasu tokugawa acknowledged that he and other scions of old 
feudal families often discuss the imprint his ancestors made 
whether we like it or not we are still living under the long 
line of tokugawa influence he said that includes many many 
many things the way we think the way we form teamwork our system 
of education 
perhaps the most enduring legacy developed from a clever method 
ieyasu tokugawa and his descendants used to stay in power scholars 
say they kept the feudal domains they controlled off balance by 
forcing each daimyo or lord to spend half the year in tokyo 
this created a nationwide capital network since money had to 
move in and out of tokyo to support the pilgrimages 
fierce competition arose between domain governments and group 
allegiance developed within them the competition led each domain 
to promote industry and agriculture in part to pay for the 
expensive journeys 
the domain governments were strongly paternalistic wrote 
marius jansen a princeton university expert on tokugawa japan 
they instituted monopolies in whatever was profitable for 
export to other domains it is no accident that one of the great 
modern firms that of mitsubishi had its origins in such an 
administrative arrangement 
friends and colleagues tease tsunenari tokugawa about the 
shogun business he must attend to on each anniversary of 
ieyasus death he goes to the nikko shrine and dons the 
traditional court costume 
this year the government called upon him to help celebrate the 
400th anniversary of tokyo the city ieyasu founded and made the 
capital of japan 
every march 1 tokyo fishermen practice one of the more obscure 
traditions binding shogun ieyasu tokugawa to modern japan they 
deliver a load of fresh whitebait to tsunenaris home as 
compensation for the fishing rights his ancestors granted theirs 
these things are not really for the tokugawa family 
tsunenari tokugawa said in a sense its in order for them to 
prove their identity

there are times when the best intentions on tv 
go poof due to such things as a feeble script and acting that is 
not so hot case in point the dreamer of oz the l frank baum 
story tonight on nbc 
the movie stars john ritter as baum the failed businessman and 
perennial optimist who wrote the wonderful wizard of oz a 
lovely book that has enchanted generations of children since it was 
published in 1900 
with annette otoole as maud his loving wife it features 
brightly colored fantasy trips into the tales of dorothy the tin 
man the scarecrow and the cowardly lion that he first spun for his 
sons and other tykes 
but the expeditions only suffer with the inevitable comparisons 
one keeps making mentally with the 1939 movie musical classic the 
wizard of oz 
that isnt the only problem a more serious one is jack benders 
direction of nbcs twohour movie its oddly flat this is a story 
that should crackle with life instead it just bobs amiably along 
even ritter who has a gift for playfulness in his acting 
generally seems wooden even when surrounded by kids 
its not that dreamer written by richard matheson doesnt 
have a heart its that it has so much heart including an 
unspecified heart ailment that eventually does in author baum it 
almost makes you want to pick it up and say 
take two tablespoons of wicked witch hightest elixir every 10 
minutes and youll be just fine 
baums tale is told through the memories of maud starting in 
1939 at the hollywood premiere of the wizard of oz like that 
movie the opening and closing scenes of tonights effort are 
filmed in black and white 
now old whitehaired and 20 years a widow maud quietly arrives 
at the premiere shes spotted by a young reporter who by golly 
once did a term paper on baums childrens books he starts asking 
questions 
thus begins a fairly conventional account of baums life and 
struggles starting with his courtship of maud when he was a 
struggling actor and she a college student enchanted by his magical 
storytelling abilities 
in due course he proposes marriage she accepts her stunned 
mother rue mcclanahan an ardent 19th century feminist violently 
objects you want to give up your education to marry an actor 
shes right he sighs shortly afterwards telling his beloved 
it is true i am an actor i have nothing all i can offer you is 
my heart 
they used this kind of stilted dialogue in the fine john wayne 
western true grit but in the spirit of fun here they usually 
do it in the spirit of serious 
the movie chronicles baums restlessness his move in the late 
1880s with his family from the east to south dakota and how he 
doted on dorothy his 6yearold niece who became the centerpiece 
of his bestknown book 
it also tells of his inspiration for the books other characters 
and title his evolution into a writer his sorrows his struggles 
his devotion to his family and yes mauds unbending belief even 
in the darkest moments that the wonderful wizard of oz would 
triumph 
too bad most of the telling to put it gently is dull its a 
sweet drama done with the best of intentions a traditional belief 
in happy endings and even a few munchkins 
but well lets put it this way ding dong the script is 
dead 
 
elsewhere in television 
sure cure for bah humbug if you have the premium cable channel 
showtime dont miss tonights broadcast of a halfhour yuletide 
music special a broadway christmas no matter that the title 
should be a west end christmas the singing is done by the 
london casts who appear in the costumes of their shows of such 
hits as les miserables cats and the broadwaybound miss 
saigon 
granted most christmas specials dont really decorate ones 
mind but this one does its magnificent work backed by lush 
imaginative orchestral arrangements 
profits from the show which will be repeated dec 13 18 23 
and 25 will go to the save the children foundation which also 
will share the profits from cassettes and compact discs of a longer 
version of tonights singing titled save the children christmas 
carols and festive songs that collection includes a particularly 
lovely new tune lets pretend its sung by phantom of the 
opera star michael crawford who is backed by a sweetvoiced 
collection of urchins

the movie crews seemed to be everywhere this 
summer but now the streets of new york are strangely quiet the 
result of an unofficial boycott by producers seeking concessions 
from the trade unions 
studio executives agree theres no place like the big apple for 
urban grit and grandeur but they say the high costs of shooting 
here have forced them to look for standin locations 
new york is unique new york is special said joel grossman 
vice president for labor relations at columbia pictures we want 
to shoot in new york but not at any price 
feature film production generated 187 million in spending in 
new york last year said jaynne keyes director of the mayors 
office of film theater and broadcasting 
this past summer was the citys biggest ever for feature films 
from the bronx county courthouse where bonfire of the vanities 
ignited sparks of protest to the brooklyn bridge closed for six 
nights to accommodate the new bruce willis thriller hudson 
hawk 
but aside from some small independent productions and woody 
allens new movie keyes said no major studio has come to the city 
to shoot a film since contracts with the international alliance of 
theatrical and stage employees expired oct 30 
instead new york movies are going elsewhere the upcoming 
rage in harlem with gregory hines and robin givens is filming 
in cincinnati 29th street is being shot in north carolina 
winter is traditionally a slow period because of the weather 
but if this is continuing in the spring when everyone is 
preparing their new films then im going to get very worried 
keyes said 
negotiations with local 52 which represents about 2000 grips 
electricians sound and video technicians and others broke down 
oct 24 negotiations with local 644 representing some 1500 
camera operators broke down dec 4 
both unions have filed charges of unfair labor practices with 
the national labor relations board local 52 covers the city and 
long island local 644s jurisdiction stretches across the east 
coast 
producers want the two locals to agree to the same concessions 
they got from unions on the west coast two years ago 
those include the right to work any eight hours out of 24 and 
any five days out of seven before overtime starts current rules 
require crews be paid at doubletime for all night and weekend 
shifts the only times much location work can be done 
local 644 business representative lou dagostino said he might 
accept the changes in return for the muchmorecomprehensive health 
plan the west coast unions get but the studios have refused 
they want us to give up approximately 30 to 40 percent of our 
pay and get nothing in return in an industry thats probably one 
of the most profitable in the united states dagostino said 
the average local 644 member makes about 28000 a year he 
said 
in the past producers from the major studios have continued to 
work in new york under terms of the old contracts while 
negotiations continued making any changes retroactive but this 
time studio executives who bargain jointly for the sake of 
convenience walked away from the bargaining table taking the work 
with them 
this is a different ball game grossman said the unions 
have said very clearly that this time theyre not prepared to agree 
to these concessions 
no studio wants their multimilliondollar movie to be held up by 
a strike he said 
if they do not agree to our concessions and new york is not a 
competitive place to shoot films then the studios wont come here 
to shoot grossman said thats not a threat its just a 
business reality 
the unions and city boosters believe film companies wont be 
able to stick with a boycott of new york for long because the 
moviegoing public demands authenticity 
there is something that new york does on film that no other 
city does keyes said there is an energy here that you can 
feel in the city that is duplicated on screen 
new york also has a unique mix of people and places 
if you dont like the location on one street in new york turn 
the corner and you have a completely different location said 
john oates president of iatse local 52 its the best back lot 
in the world 
but producers believe they can duplicate the new york feel 
elsewhere the academy awardwinning moonstruck was shot 
largely in toronto look whos talking one of last years 
biggest moneymakers was shot entirely in vancouver british 
columbia 
the moviegoing audience is happy to accept other standins 
for new york grossman said 
even keyes whose job it is to tout new yorks charm and woo 
moviemakers here admits things dont look good 
i always say you can buy three polyester blouses or one silk 
one the silk one is new york she said in these economic 
times people may just need to buy a polyester blouse

neighbors of peter sellows company 
dont seem to mind that he turns mountains of ripe garbage and 
sewer sludge into compost thats probably because they cant smell 
it 
sellows company has borrowed from history exploiting what he 
calls an ageold farmers secret for taking the barnyard stench out 
of composting now one of the fastest growing methods for 
environmentally sensitive garbage disposal 
his story begins in 1977 when the onetime nursery owner was 
bagging homemade compost and a tip from a chicken farmer took him 
to japan 
there he found the technology for an indoor composting system 
that turned sewage sludge yard clippings and other waste into 
nutrientrich compost without the suffocating aroma usually 
produced 
sellow updated the japanese technology to meet american 
wastedisposal problems and patented it in 1982 he founded 
international process systems inc to sell design plans and 
equipment for composting plants to towns and private companies 
composting is as old as mankind said archie albright the 
companys president and chief operating officer by using 
composting were solving an enormous problem in a costeffective 
and environmentally safe way 
the company was in the right place at the right time last year 
when the connecticut legislature enacted a mandatory recycling law 
that takes effect jan 1 
its customers include the town of fairfield which last year 
opened what local officials say was the first municipal composting 
plant in new england 
many companies compost yard wastes alone albright said but 
only about a halfdozen companies in the country offer ways to 
combine sewage sludge with garbage and trash to form an odorfree 
safe compost he said 
for years farmers have mixed manure and dead crops and allowed 
the mixture to dry and break down on open land creating a rich 
fertilizer for the next planting seaso 
the modernday recipe calls for sewage sludge and yard waste 
plus any variety of newspapers office paper and cardboard along 
with runofthemill garbage like last nights leftovers 
the technology is relatively simple 
mounds of garbage go into a giant mixing machine the blend is 
dumped into a concrete bay agitators churn it moving it slowly 
through a conveyor system as blowers add oxygen 
after about three weeks the original mess has been turned into 
compost ready to be bagged and sold 
compost itself doesnt smell its basically just dirt its 
getting the compost from garbage and sewage sludge that produces 
the foul smell 
the odor is kept inside the composting plants through negative 
air pressure when the doors are opened air is sucked in not out 
also fans blow oxygen through the plant and the exhaust air is 
pumped through biofilters containing tiny bacteria that eat the 
stuff that smells 
the town of fairfield turned to the company ips in 1988 the 
local landfill was nearing capacity and the town faced trucking its 
waste to the trashtoenergy plant in nearby bridgeport an 
extremely expensive prospect 
fairfield paid 3 million to build its recycling plant 
including about 750000 that went to international process systems 
for the plans 
residents were at first wary of the companys claim of odorless 
composting other composting plants like one in lancaster county 
pa have come under fire for the odor problem 
people always associate garbage dumps with smell first 
selectman jacquelyn c durrell said there were concerns because 
it was new and was never tried before 
but once the plant started operation and there was no telltale 
odor marking the plants location local officials knew they had 
made the right decision 
i knew we were on the right track when months after the plant 
was running someone asked me if we had the plant started 
durrell said

the canton nc fire chief phillip smathers shipped out 
with the reserves and took along the city building inspector 
phillip smathers 
big stone gap va lost its local police sergeant two members 
of its volunteer rescue squad and four voices from the lonesome 
pine community chorus 
the chorus more lonesome than ever has canceled its annual 
christmas concert 
across america the deployment of troops for operation desert 
shield in saudi arabia has changed daily life in unexpected ways 
pushing spouses into new roles and removing key players who often 
wear more than one important hat in the towns where they live 
it also has knocked the economic wind from communities heavily 
dependent on reservists or on nearby military bases that are 
emptying out as iraqs occupation of kuwait drags into its fifth 
month 
the central texas town of killeen reeling from the callup of 
20000 of the 38500 soldiers from nearby fort hood has become an 
economic disaster area 
i feel the mayors of these cities across the country who are 
responsible for these people affected should have been briefed on 
what to expect mayor major blair said after all were the 
ones who pay taxes to support this operation we provide the 
infrastructure for these military people now that infrastructure 
is being shattered 
fourteen businesses have closed including six car dealers a 
steakhouse and two gas stations one of which had been in town 25 
years blair said business is down as much as 60 percent for other 
merchants rental occupancy is half its usual level and 1000 area 
homes are vacant 
the city and local college are documenting the problems and plan 
to use them in a plea for assistance to the us department of 
commerce blair said 
they can provide all these funds for acts of god disasters 
he said and nothing has been addressed with respect to economic 
disasters at the hands of the government 
businesses ranging from auto dealers to pizza parlors say sales 
are off by 30 percent to 80 percent in st robert mo a town of 
1700 near fort leonard wood in southcentral missouri 
thomas moore assistant manager of a local supermarket said the 
bases 25300 soldiers civilians and dependents formed the areas 
economic backbone the whole town revolves around the base he 
said 
the same might be said of hinesville ga where homes sales are 
down as much as 30 percent and many rentals stand empty since 
14000 soldiers left nearby fort stewart 
i think every business in town is affected realtor allen 
brown said there are a lot of people concerned 
among them is howard curley gainous owner of curleys 
barber shop whose 10000amonth business has been devastated by 
the loss of thousands of closecropped military customers 
its been terrible the first month it dropped to less than 
half then it dropped even more he said 
its the same story 3000 miles away at charlenes house of 
beauty in twentynine palms calif near the marine corps training 
center charlene luongo watched her profits evaporate as thousands 
of marines pulled out of the nations largest such base followed 
by many of their wives and girlfriends 
the way i understand it they went home to mama she said 
ive lost about 50 percent of my business 
tony jones has watched business fall off by more than 20 percent 
at the laundry and car wash he owns in hopkinsville ky near fort 
campbell which has deployed 17000 soldiers so far the sooner 
they return the better 
yesterday would have been too late jones said when you 
sit here and chart your business i think you realize they mean 
a lot to us 
in some communities individual departures have meant more than 
local residents might have imagined 
the trial of a man accused of murder and attempted murder in 
grand forks nd was postponed because his defense attorney was 
called to active duty 
seven doctors at hospitals in the pascagoula miss area were 
called up last month leaving three hospitals in the region without 
any plastic surgeons 
the parks and recreation director in watauga county nc 
shipped out this month reidsville a north carolina town of about 
13000 lost its only police narcotics officer mac ellison who 
also was a member of the countywide narcotics task force 
wewoka okla gave up one officer and one dispatcher to 
military service a blow for a department of 10 
it creates some hardships for us said city manager greg 
mcelroy its created a shortage were trying to fill 
walhalla nd said goodbye to 20 of its 1429 residents 
including mailman dale anderson

operation desert shield wont protect the 
nations weapons makers from lean times or save thousands of 
workers from layoff military experts said 
give or take a tank here and a missile system there defense 
contractors say they are sticking by their gloomy forecasts and 
lawmakers still talk about legislation to help communities hardest 
hit by defense budget cuts 
even with a war the outlook does not necessarily improve for 
arms contractors 
to the extent that this conflict creates the outlook for peace 
in the middle east it worsens the prospects for major defense 
contractors said thomas lloydbutler an analyst who watches 
defense contractors for montgomery securities in san francisco 
the most immediate financial beneficiaries of the deployment of 
us troops to the persian gulf are small manufacturers of 
uniforms personal items protective gear and food the pentagon is 
spending billions on shiploads of sun screen cold drink mix 
desertcamouflaged clothing prepared meals and bottled water 
but theres been no comparable surge in orders for weapons 
manufacturers the predictions of lean times that preceded the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait by iraqi forces remain unshaken 
were looking over the next five years at a declining defense 
budget theres no doubt about that said pete schmidt an 
analyst with the defense budget project a washingtonbased think 
tank what desert shield has done is affect the slope of the 
decline its not going to be as steep its not shrinking as 
fast 
there have been some exceptions the land systems division of 
general dynamics which encompasses plants in michigan ohio and 
connecticut gained a windfall in the sale of some 700 tanks to 
saudi arabia 
raytheon co of lexington mass has already sold the saudis 
11 billion in antiaircraft missile systems and will likely sell 
more 
though there havent been any new orders for c17 transport 
planes they were in short supply during the airlift to saudi 
arabia and the pentagon may be considering another order the 
planes are made by mcdonnell douglas corp with engines from pratt 
amp whitney 
pratt and the other major jet engine maker general electric 
corp may also benefit from new orders and maintenance contracts 
for plane and helicopter engines the desert heat and sand lead to 
frequent engine overhauls and replacements 
theres no doubt this isnt detrimental schmidt said 
theyre smiling theyre smiling all the way to the bank 
rey aponte of the army materiel command said that while theres 
been no rush of new orders for weapons thats being considered in 
higher echelons of the pentagon 
but unless a war breaks out bringing on the wholesale 
destruction of weapons and the need for new equipment and maybe 
not even then all youve done is slightly postpone how 
precipitous the decline will be in the defense budget said ron 
hertenstein research vice president at forecast international a 
connecticutbased consulting firm 
a war could actually hurt military contractors who are primarily 
involved in futureoriented research and development projects 
in a shooting battle you produce more of what youve got on 
line ready to go said schmidt the analyst with the defense 
budget project your modernization gets put on hold 
the defense budget project recently looked into the question of 
which contractors might be hurt by a persian gulf war contractors 
involved in the b2 bomber project and the advanced tactical 
fighter particularly northrop corp might lose heavily if a war 
cut into funding for the costly aircraft 
the costs and requirements of war might under schmidts 
analysis require a reversal of the defense spending strategy 
outlined earlier this year by sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee nunn said the pentagon should 
modernize weapons within a lean budget 
sen john warner rva the ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee and a former secretary of the navy said 
the sudden cost increases of desert shield may be offset by 
contributions from foreign countries and by the decline of the cost 
of manning the nato front in europe 
the most likely beneficiaries of desert shield among weapons 
makers warner said will be those who make ammunition and 
missiles like martin marietta corp and raytheon 
one after another spokesmen for the major defense contractors 
said theyre not profiting from desert shield 
bob obrien mcdonnell douglas i dont think any hardware 
manufacturer has a surge in orders you cant just spit these 
things out 
alvin spivak general dynamics there hasnt been any 
immediate significant increase in sales of our products as a result 
of the mideast situation 
george jamison ge theres been no significant impact 
one official for a military contractor who asked to remain 
anonymous said the companys board is predicting further reductions 
in defense spending when the president proposes a budget in 
january 
if anything its looking worse the official said the 
pentagon as far as we know is in for more severe cuts

the next presidential campaign will likely 
feature a fiery debate over affirmative action but one party will 
call it simple justice the other will label it unfair quotas and 
voters will have to decide whom to believe 
sen jesse helms rode to reelection in north carolina after 
accusing his black challenger democrat harvey gantt of supporting 
racial quotas and while some denounced the tactic others detected 
a way to bolster the identity and electoral strength of the 
republican party 
helms came from 13 points behind to win comfortably i think 
solely on this issue said gop consultant roger stone it is 
the kind of cutting social issue that conservatives need to hold 
onto the white house 
a number of recent developments suggest voters may be hearing a 
lot more about affirmative action and racial quotas between now and 
november 1992 
democratic congressional leaders have renewed their pledge to 
once again pass a civil rights bill that president bush branded a 
quota bill and vetoed in the last congress 
virginia gov doug wilder the only democrat blatantly testing 
the 1992 presidential waters blasted bushs characterization of 
the bill and said it gave helms phony ammunition i know what 
racial quotas are i have experienced them firsthand wilder who 
is black said in a letter to bush 
william bennett the new republican party chairman defended 
helms use of the quota issue and said he was ready to debate 
affirmative action if the democrats bring it up most americans 
are troubled by racial preference programs he said 
rep richard gephardt the house democratic leader chided 
bennett for his remarks in a speech last week and charged that 
ideologues on the right are following a new trail of racial 
resentment and recrimination blazed by louisiana state legislator 
david duke 
disaffected democrats at a conservative forum predicted doom 
for their party unless more moderate voices are heard until we 
give up fear and discuss these issues rationally and logically we 
are going to continue to lose said former new york mayor ed 
koch 
prominent democrats say their party has a sound position but 
others have distorted it 
i dont know what there is to redefine said party chairman 
ron brown who is black the democratic party and its chairman in 
particular vehemently oppose quotas we vehemently oppose anything 
that could lead to reverse discrimination the legislation that the 
democratic congress sent forward to the president was not a quota 
bill it was supported by a number of conservative republicans 
but the democrats including gantt himself acknowledge that 
they havent communicated well with voters many of whom equate 
affirmative action with quotas as stone noted harvey gantt ran 
up and down north carolina saying he wasnt for quotas but nobody 
believed him 
working against the democrats is a feeling among some voters 
that the civil rights agenda of the 1960s has been fulfilled that 
affirmative action was supposed to be temporary and smallscale and 
has outlived its time 
but gantt said hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be 
remedied in two decades thats not even one generation he 
said we need to do it and we need to remove the stigma that 
were going to discriminate against whites or were going to 
promote blacks who arent qualified none of that is true 
many democrats maintain the heart of the matter is economics 
they say republicans want to divert attention from the recession 
and the whole idea of affirmative action is more threatening now 
because jobs are scarce 
this issue is about a shrinking economic pie and people 
thinking someones going to give their slice to somebody else 
said democratic strategist mike mccurry 
you have to recast the debate to show the republicans are 
trying to peddle fear instead of a plan to get the economy going 
and you have to have an answer for the working person who fears for 
his job he added you have to say my plan is to develop a 
redhot economy so we all have jobs 
republican analyst doug bailey thinks his party too should 
look at the big picture he said it would be a big political 
mistake to lean heavily on affirmative action to fill the void 
left by the end of the cold war and the splintering of the gop on 
abortion and taxes 
it turns off a large corps of moderate voters northern 
suburban voters who have supported the republican party in the 
past bailey said they will not want to see a party 
intentionally choose an issue even though it may have some merit 
which divides people on racial lines 
however stone said the theme would appeal to a group that is 
equally if not more important to the party bluecollar reagan 
democrats and he maintained it could be pursued without the gop 
appearing to be insensitive or divisive 
you can use other issues to illustrate your desire for 
economic growth in the minority community stone said go out 
and campaign against quotas but for enterprise zones and greater 
financial assistance for minority education 
but the democrats firmly believe they hold the higher ground on 
civil rights and can persuade voters of that foreshadowing the 
rhetoric to come wilder has accused bush of failing to provide 
moral leadership and brown called his veto of the civil rights bill 
a disgrace 
he had an important choice to make the party chairman said 
and he chose the politics of jesse helms and david duke rather 
than the politics of martin luther king and abraham lincoln

has the gold market given up the ghost 
that question is debated with increased intensity these days by 
analysts who have watched the price of gold barely budge through 
all the financial and political tumult since iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
to some observers this behavior is a sign that gold has 
suffered some permanent loss of luster as a haven from the ravages 
of economic and political upheaval 
this is the first time in 30 years that gold has not bounced 
materially in value in the face of a confluence of difficult world 
problems say analysts clarence morrison and timothy alch in a 
new report for prudentialbache securities in new york 
although this may be a temporary situation we need to rethink 
golds historic role for the future 
a hard core of loyalists maintains that all the obituaries are 
unwarranted or at least premature 
they say gold retains its timehonored status as a store of 
value in effect an international promise to pay that cant be 
broken by politicians or anybody else with the power to devalue 
currencies or default on debt 
it constitutes a unique hedge against the world monetary 
establishment says james grant in the current edition of his 
newsletter grants interest rate observer 
but even the gold bugs generally concede that the evidence 
on the market charts of late has been running against them 
while the price of oil has surged this year for instance gold 
has remained stuck between 350 an ounce and 400 an ounce 
hovering lately in the middle of that narrow range 
that is less than half the peak of about 875 it reached in 
early 1980 the last time soaring oil prices set off a worldwide 
economic scare 
one bank analyst helped to heat up the debate recently by 
proposing a decent burial for gold he and others argue in 
part that sophisticated modern investment products and strategies 
allow investors more appealing ways to seek a combination of safety 
and a return on their money 
they focus on a drawback long cited by golds detractors its 
inability to produce any current income in the form of dividends or 
interest 
in fact the effective yield on direct investments in gold 
is often negative when costs of such things as storage security 
and sales taxes are taken into account 
that consideration is especially important these days analysts 
say because currentlevels of interest rates produce generous 
real returns above the inflation rate 
a decade ago when gold was hot nominal interest rates ran well 
into double digits but they were close to zero after subtracting 
for inflation 
furthermore points out the value line investment survey in 
contrast to 10 years ago most world debt is floating rate rather 
than fixed rate this means that interest rates will adjust quickly 
to changes in the rate of inflation reducing the value of gold as 
a hedge 
maybe so says grant but trust in paper investments based on 
credit may well be tested further in the future 
his closing argument when the world decides to renounce its 
search for the highest available interest rate and to search 
instead for the lowest available risk it may remember gold

although the stock market has staged a spirited 
rally in the waning weeks of 1990 a sizeable contingent of bears 
on wall street isnt buying it 
they say stocks are still no bargain by historical standards 
and face some formidable obstacles from a recession that may have 
just barely begun in the us economy 
we continue to believe there is aboveaverage risk in the 
stock market says robert nurock a paoli pa investment 
adviser the economic monetary and technical outlooks all remain 
sufficiently negative to warrant a cautious investment stance 
analysts readily acknowledge that it isnt unusual to see stocks 
turning upward before there is any discernible evidence of a slump 
in business conditions 
but the doubters question how long buyers can keep celebrating a 
drop in interest rates and shrugging off evidence of weakening 
conditions for growth and profitability 
until prospects for the economy and corporate profits improve 
stock prices appear vulnerable to recurring bouts of selling 
pressure maintain analysts at wright investors service a 
bridgeport conn investment management firm 
wright notes that the stocks in the dow jones industrial average 
have lately been selling at an aggregate ratio of 19 times their 
book value or theoretical worth should their operations be 
liquidated and the proceeds distributed to shareowners 
over the past 40 years the firm says the market has generally 
fluctuated between one and two times book value with an average 
multiple of about 15 during the last seven recessions it bottomed 
out at an average level of 11 
whether or not current pricevalue multiples represent an 
accurate appraisal of the markets longterm growth potential they 
appear to be excessive for the recessionary environment of 
199091 wright concludes 
heiko thieme at deutsche bank capital corp in new york who 
argues that stock prices probably bottomed out several weeks ago 
nevertheless concedes that falsestart upswings are common in the 
midst of declining markets 
the primary downward trend in a bear market is often abruptly 
broken by quick moves to the upside fueled by premature 
optimism thieme says 
whether false or true the markets latest advance continued in 
the past week the dow jones average closed friday at 259010 up 
3045 from the week before 
since it closed at an 18month low of 236510 on oct 11 the 
averaage has risen 225 points or 95 percent 
other readings for the week showed the nyses composite index of 
all its listed common stocks up 301 at 17907 the american stock 
exchange market value index up 466 at 30645 and the nasdaq 
composite index for the overthecounter market up 1248 at 37154 
volume on the big board averaged 200 million shares a day 
against 15158 million the wek before 
nurock says an important force behind the bull market of the 
1980s a steady shrinkage in the amount of stock available for 
trading seems to have spent itself as the 90s begin 
much of that reduction stemmed from corporate restructurings and 
takeovers in which debt was used to replace stock in the base of 
capital used by many businesses 
now the takeover boom has faded and debt is unfashionable to 
say the least 
in fact nurock suggests the supply of stock may actually start 
to swell with a shift back from debt to equity capital 
corporations need to reliquefy their balance sheets after 
taking on so much debt during the last economic cycle he says 
with interest expenses growing for many businesses and the 
ability to service indebtedness diminishing the sale of new stock 
will become an important priority in raising new capital

the christmas spirit took a back seat to consumer concerns about 
the economy and the middle east in november resulting in another 
disappointing month for many of the nations biggest retailers 
several stores said thursday their sales fell from november 1989 
levels including sears roebuck and co jc penney co inc and 
may department stores co 
analysts were pessimistic about the chances for retailers to 
turn the christmas season around 
unless a very quick solution to the mideast were to occur 
consumer confidence will remain extremely weak said jeffrey 
feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
consumers sharply curtailed their holiday spending even during 
the thanksgiving weekend traditionally one of the most popular 
shopping periods in the year 
retailers are expecting most of their holiday business to come 
during the last 10 days before christmas 
but jeffrey edelman an analyst with barclays de zoete wedd 
inc predicted that after adjusting for inflation the retail 
industry will see its overall sales drop 1 percent to 2 percent for 
the holiday season some individual retailers are likely to suffer 
even sharper declines 
thats what a recessions all about he said 
consumer spending on nonessentials such as clothing furniture 
and appliances has fallen sharply since the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait sent gasoline and heating oil prices higher leaving 
americans with less money to spend 
many shoppers have said they will spend less on gifts this 
christmas because they dont have as much extra money as they did 
last year consumer caution was evident last month not only in how 
much shoppers were spending but in what consumers were buying and 
where they shopped 
department stores and general merchandise retailers like sears 
bore the brunt of novembers dismal results but discount stores 
fared somewhat better 
kenneth macke the chairman of dayton hudson corp said in an 
interview this week that some of the most popular items this season 
were practical rather than trendy flannel shirts and clothing 
made of fleece 
a poor christmas could lead to severe financial problems for 
somecompanies one already struggling is child world inc the 
nations secondlargest toy store chain which has suspended 
payment on some of its bills because it is short of cash 
child world which reports its sales quarterly has said it will 
cut prices at its 182 stores that could put pressure on its 
competitors to also mark merchandise down 
many stores have been cutting inventories in hopes of avoiding 
markdowns retailers also continue to trim expenses in hopes of 
preserving their profits sears announced this week it is freezing 
salaries for 20000 of its managers as part of its costcutting 
program 
sears the nations largest retailer said november sales at 
stores open at least a year fell 24 percent while the companys 
overall sales dropped 16 percent 
analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year also 
known as samestore or comparable store sales provide a more 
accurate assessment of a retailers performance than overall sales 
new stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can skew 
a retailers results 
penney said samestore sales dropped 46 percent while overall 
sales slipped 31 percent 
may suffered a 5 percent drop in samestore sales as its overall 
sales fell 02 percent 
even walmart stores inc which consistently outperforms the 
rest of the industry saw sales lag walmart reported its 
samestore sales were up 7 percent below the discount retailers 
usual doubledigit increase while overall sales were up 22 
percent 
walmart reached a milestone in november passing kmart corp to 
become the nations secondlargest retailer walmart chalked up 
2546 billion in yeartodate sales through november while kmart 
recorded nearly 252 billion 
for the month of november kmart said samestore sales fell 15 
percent while overall sales rose 51 percent 
the results differ from the monthly retail sales report from the 
government which includes sales from supermarkets restaurants and 
car dealers 
in other retailers reports 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
said its samestore sales rose 4 percent while overall sales 
jumped 24 percent 
dayton hudson reported a 34 percent gain in samestore sales 
and a 151 percent rise overall a poor showing at dayton hudsons 
department stores was offset by its target discount stores and 
mervyns moderatepriced apparel chain 
woolworth corp said samestore sales picked up 13 percent 
while overall sales rose 49 percent

opec is expected to reject attempts 
to cap production when the cartel meets next week reaffirming an 
agreement to let oil flow while the middle east crisis persists 
gulf sources said members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries are producing about 23 million barrels per day 
500000 barrels over the ceiling agreed to in late july just days 
before iraq invaded kuwait 
prices have fluctuated between 25 and 40 per barrel on rumors 
of war well above the target price of 18 per barrel despite the 
increase opec is expected to rebuff any calls to reduce 
production 
at an emergency session in august the 13 opec nations agreed to 
ignore the ceilings and quotas to make up for the 4 million barrel 
per day loss of kuwait and iraqi oil due to a united nations 
embargo 
sources said the agreement will hold when representatives of the 
13 opec nations open a formal meeting wednesday in geneva 
ministers are to begin gathering monday for informal discussions 
it is meaningless and harming opec and all its members to say 
oil is selling at higher than the stated price and we have to 
decrease production a saudi source said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
saudi arabia alone has pushed production up by about 60 percent 
from 538 million barrels daily just before the invasion to 83 
million barrels per day 
both iraq and iran will push for decreased production a gulf 
source said damage from the 198088 iraniraq war means iran 
cannot increase production beyond its 264 million barrels a day 
quotaand it is eager for high prices to help rebuild its 
production 
in addition iran has a backlog of about 40 million barrels of 
unsold heavy crude in europe the gulf source said 
iraq is expected to accuse saudi arabia of kowtowing to american 
interests at the opec gathering 
they will make some noise but nobody is going to listen to 
them the saudi source said the meeting will most likely 
reaffirm the august agreement that there is no quota no ceiling 
until the crisis is over 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela 
iran also may push the organization to discuss cooperating with 
consumer nations on investing in increased production the sources 
said saudi arabia is likely to support the idea but argue it 
should be done through bilateral agreements 
saudi arabia also is expected to reaffirm its commitment to a 
stable market even in the event of fighting earlier this week 
saudi officials told us secretary of energy james watkins the 
country might lose up to 2 million barrels of oil daily if fighting 
breaks out as workers flee its northeastern fields near iraq 
industry sources said 
iraq is not expected to be able to damage the fields but lack 
of personnel could force some fields to close the sources said 
fighting alone much less a shutdown would likely send oil prices 
to unparalled heights due to market panic 
watkins told the saudis the united states would be willing to 
draw down its 600millionbarrel strategic petroleum reserves to 
make up any shortfall during a war the sources said 
there is some question as to who will represent iraq at the 
meeting acting oil minister hussein kamal a close relative of 
saddam hussein is unlikely to attend 
a possible representative is assistant oil minister sami sherif 
altakriti who is from saddams native village he was installed 
last year when kamal who also is minister of industry and military 
industrialization wrested the refining industry into his domain 
the gulf source said

lawyers for the government and michael milken 
are disputing the dollar amount that should be attached to the 
financial felons admitted crimes the two sides are more that 4 
million apart 
the number is important because an estimate of the total fraud 
involved in milkens crimes will help determine when he will become 
eligible for parole 
milken 44 was sentenced last month to 10 years in prison and 
three years probation for his guilty plea to six felony counts 
related to illegal securities trading he also agreed to pay 600 
million in penalties 
under federal guidelines if the losses from milkens crimes 
exceeded 1 million he would get a recommended sentence of 40 to 52 
months before qualifying for parole if the losses totaled 200000 
to 1 million milken would face a recommended 24 to 36 months 
before parole 
in letters to us district judge kimba wood on thursday 
prosecutors said milkens crimes involved more than 47 million in 
fraud while the defense placed the total at 326000 
but at a hearing wood said she may not include an estimate in 
her recommendation to the us parole commission she said she 
might instead offer parole officials guidelines to help them set a 
figure on their own 
parole commission rules are not precise about how to calculate 
wrongdoing in complex securities trading cases such as milkens 
the government said the commission should consider the illegal 
economic benefit to milken and the consequences of his illegal 
relationships to the financial markets 
nonetheless both sides offered their own version of milkens 
admitted fraud 
assistant us attorneys john carroll and jess fardella said 
that while it is difficult to calculate milkens financial 
wrongdoing his illegal dealings in seven transactions included in 
the guilty plea can be valued at a minimum of 47 million 
the figure includes a 3 million financing fee paid to drexel in 
connection with an illegal arrangement with admitted inside trader 
ivan boesky on trading in fishbach corp securities but wood last 
week said the amount should not be included in the parole 
recommendation 
on other transactions prosecutors included 113000 in 
commission income paid to drexel related to stock manipulation of 
mca inc plus an undetermined amount for the actual manipulation 
the defense put the figure at 26250 
the government calculated damages of 862 million from 
fraudulent payments in an ilegal arrangement with money manager 
david solomon the defense said the total cannot exceed 300000 
prosecutors claimed the government was defrauded of 483000 in 
taxes evaded by solomon with milkens help through bogus trades in 
1985 the defense said the figure is only 367500 but it also 
claimed drexel paid the taxes that solomon didnt so the 
government lost no money 
finally prosecutors said milken was to split at least 500000 
in unrealized gains with boesky for trading in harris graphics 
securities the defense said there is no evidence milken ever 
received any gain or the money was the result of an illegality 
the defense calculation amounted to 326250 if the solomon tax 
loss is discounted and 693000 if it is not 
the discrepancies relate primarily to legal disputes over 
precisely what wrongdoing should be included in the calculations 
milken admitted to conspiracy securities and mail fraud helping 
solomon file false income taxes and violating securities and 
exchange commission regulations 
milken is to report to federal custody on march 4 no prison has 
yet been designated

while the federal reserve didnt support the 
dollar during its precipitous augusttoseptember decline 
officials at the nations central bank say they remain concerned 
about the drop in the us currency 
the fed said thursday it took no action to support the dollar in 
the latest threemonth period when the us currency touched new 
lows in foreign exchange trading it was the second straight period 
the fed didnt intervene 
but sam y cross an executive vice president at the federal 
reserve bank of new york said the decision not to step in 
certainly should not be regarded as any indication the united 
states is out of the intervention business 
the fed has the authority to buy and sell dollars to influence 
the currencys direction 
the quarterly foreignexchange report by the new york fed showed 
the dollar declined 4 percent to 45 percent against the major 
european currencies in the period ended oct 31 
specifically the dollar touched record lows against the german 
mark and swiss franc and fell nearly 11 percent against the 
japanese yen 
the period was marked by a barrage of marketmoving economic and 
political events most notably the eruption of the persian gulf 
crisis which had both a positive and negative effect on the 
dollar 
on one hand the dollar benefited from the perception its a 
safehaven currency in times of world turmoil indeed the dollar 
reached a peak during the period on aug 2 when iraq invaded 
kuwait reaching 16215 german marks and 15160 japanese yen 
but the fed report said the dollar was later undermined by 
concerns that the us economy was more vulnerable than other major 
economies to the steep rise in oil prices caused by the conflict 
in addition the dollar also was hurt by continued concern over 
the health of the us economy and rising interest rates overseas 
the fed noted that hikes in japanese and german interest rates as 
us rates declined eliminated the dollars interestrate 
advantage 
the dollar currently is trading at about 14885 german marks and 
13215 japanese yen 
the dollar steadied in september when finance ministers from 
the group of seven industrialized nations met in washington and 
issued a statement saying exchange rates were broadly in line 
there were rumors that the fed had intervened during the period 
but that was not the case still cross said it should not be 
taken as an indication us authorities are indifferent to 
movements in the dollar or are welcoming dollar declines to the 
contrary us authorities are on record in a number of recent 
statesments indicating their concern over the dollar declines 
he pointed to recent testimony by fed chairman alan greenspan 
who said a weaker dollar is cause for concern despite the fact that 
a lower dollar makes us exports more competitive abroad 
one cannot conclude that the united states is prepared to 
see the dollar weaken cross said the dollar is in a range 
where we have to be very watchful and concerned 
but the fed does not intervene solely because of market 
mechanics cross said the decision to step in is based on a number 
of factors including the condition in the foreign exchange 
market and other financial markets the size and speed of movements 
in foreign exchange rates the assessment of market attitues and 
sentiment and anticipation of the reaction to any fed move as 
well as the broad economic and politcal climate 
the last time the fed chose not intervene for two backtoback 
periods was in late 1986

former hooker corp chairman george 
herscu was sentenced friday to five years in prison after being 
convicted of corruption charges involving a state politician 
herscu once one of australias 10 richest men but now bankrupt 
showed no emotion when brisbane district court judge pat shanahan 
imposed a sentence that was two years less than the maximum 
the 62yearold romania native was found guilty thursday of 
paying 77000 in 1983 to a cabinet minister to influence brisbane 
officials to ease pedestrian and vehicle access restrictions to a 
failing shopping center 
shanahan told herscu the money must be the most unwise 
investment he ever made saying it led herscu to court to prison 
and to disgrace the judge made no recommendation as to early 
parole 
earlier the developer wept in court as several character 
witnesses many of them longtime friends testified on his behalf 
herscu had pleaded not guilty to two charges of official 
corruption he claimed he made the two 38500 payments to 
queensland cabinet minister russ hinze who at the time was the 
state minister for main roads and local government to buy him two 
racehorses 
but the brisbane district court jury found him guilty after a 
fourweek trial 
a romanian jew herscu worked in nazi labor camps during world 
war ii until being liberated by the soviet army in 1944 he moved 
to australia in 1950 
as a 25yearold in 1953 herscu bought one small grocery store 
then others including one at the 1956 melbourne olympics in 1959 
he went into property development 
the beginning of the end came in 1986 when herscu took over 
hooker corp australias premier property developer with 
substantial us interests 
herscu took out loans and spent 1 billion in part on upmarket 
american retailers including bonwit teller 
after being steered into shoppingcenter developments in the 
united states hooker grounded on a 15 billion debt in july 1989 
both hooker and herscus personal company hersfield developments 
corp went into liquidation 
in july herscu and his wife sheila declared themselves 
bankrupt the move came two days before a bankruptcy claim made

nations fifthlargest carrier sought protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
at a news conference at the airport continental executive vice

a plane to service the route 
frankfurt has emerged as one of the key business centers of 
western europe nelson said in a release and we anticipate 
continued growth as the european economic community reaches its 
1992 unification 
the new route requires us department of transportation 
approval but nelson said it would be virtually automatic and 
come within the next few weeks frankfurt would become the 
airlines 54th international destination 
continental has been saying since mondays bankruptcy filing 
that its operations will not be affected by the financial 
reorganization the airline was forced into bankruptcy court by 
soaring fuel costs and mounting interest payments on its 62 
billion debt 
nelson said performance has not suffered as a result of the 
filing he said traffic flow and cancellations were running at 
normal rates though he acknowledged that the airlines bookings 
have been soft 
the airline released department of transportation figures 
showing that continental had the fifth best ontime performance 
among major airlines in october and the third lowest rate of 
mishandled baggage 
ive been amazed he said our airline is running 
beautifully

atampt unveiled its financing plans for a hostile 
61 billion takeover offer of ncr corp but the computer maker 
continued its verbal battle against the telephone giants bid 
american telephone amp telegraph co said thursday that chemical 
bank would lead a group of financial institutions that would 
provide a 6 billion line of credit for the takeover the credit 
line also would back up shortterm notes that the phone company 
plans to sell to investors to help fund the takeover 
atampt also said it plans to fund the takeover in part with some 
of its cash on hand which totals more than 800 million 
speaking at a computer industry symposium in atlanta ncr 
chairman charles e exley jr made a passing reference thursday to 
the 90ashare takeover attempt saying that in the past few days 
he has learned more about mergers and acquisitions than he ever 
wanted to know 
but nothing will deter us from pursuing our vision of a new 
era for computing exley said referring to ncrs plans 
announced in september to replace its entire product line with 
industrystandard machines that use the same microprocessor 
exley jokingly suggested that american telephone amp telegraph co 
would be launching a new advertisting campaign with the slogan 
reach out and grab someone 
exley has said repeatedly the dayton ohiobased company will 
fight atampts tender offer which expires jan 4 however ncr has 
not disclosed how it will battle the bid 
industry analysts say exley has few options the most likely is 
to find another merger partner that offers more favorable terms 
than atampt or a partner that takes only a minority stake in ncr but 
still blocks the phone companys bid 
atampt says it wants to buy the nations fifthlargest computer 
company to bolster its lackluster and unprofitable computer 
business which it launched six years ago 
ncrs board on wednesday turned down an atampt bid in which the 
phone company would have exchanged 90 worth of its stock for each 
ncr share calling it grossly inadequate 
late wednesday afternoon atampt took its offer directly to ncr 
shareholders and changed the terms to cash including all ncr 
stock both outstanding shares and those provided under stock 
warrants the deal is valued at about 61 billion 
ncr said it would be willing to discuss a merger if atampt boosted 
its price to 125 a share for a total of about 85 billion but 
atampt called the figure outrageous and totally unjustified 
industry analysts generally believe atampt will end up the victor 
with the selling price somewhat above 90 a share 
an official of a major institutional owner of ncr stock who 
spoke on condition on anonymity said he believed many ncr 
shareholders would wait a week or so to see how the takeover battle 
develops before they would sell their shares to atampt 
theyre looking for a higher offer or for ncr to do something 
to create higher value he said 
the chairman of ncr seems very shareholderoriented or has 
been in the past and i think he is one to continue to act that 
way he added 
several creditratings agencies said thursday they were 
reviewing their opinions on atampt bonds and other debt in light of 
the ncr bid gray said the move was not unexpected 
atampt also said it filed federal lawsuits in baltimore and 
columbus ohio seeking rulings that federal law concerning such 
takeovers will prevail over state laws in the ncr bid ncr is 
incorporated in maryland 
gray described the lawsuits as routine in takeovers ncr 
spokesman mark feighery said the company would have no comment on 
the suits until it studied them 
for its part ncr filed a suit in us district court in dayton 
seeking a declaratory judgment that its antitakeover provisions 
are valid

an arizona consumer electronics firm has 
filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the merger of mca inc and 
matsushita electric industrial co claiming they are conspiring to 
sabotage sales of its videocassette recorders 
the federal suit filed in phoenix contends matsushitas 66 
billion purchase of mca violates antitrust law 
matsushita denied the allegations in a statement that said we 
have only had time for a brief review of the material however 
even on the basis of our brief review it is apparent the suit is 
totally without merit 
the suit was filed by govideo inc a scottsdale ariz 
company which has marketed a videocassette recorder that can record 
two tv programs at the same time or play one tape while recording 
another 
talk that matsushita needs mca to stay competitive after 
archrival sony corp purchased columbia pictures entertainment 
inc is a smokescreen said attorney joseph alioto 
alioto has represented govideo in a series of actions 
contending matsushita sony and other asian companies want to shut 
out all us consumer electronics makers he said hed taken more 
than 70 depositions in japan over a threemonth period that support 
that allegation 
we know that if you control the software you cnntrol the 
hardware except for govideo they already have a monopoly in 
the hardware this is to make sure guys like us dont get in 
alioto said 
he said the japanese companies intend to use their domination of 
both sides of the entertainment business to ensure that 
govideos products will not play their software and anybody 
else outside japan who makes hdtv wont either 
the primary objective of the japanese companies is to dominate 
the highdefinition television market alioto said in a telephone 
interview from san francisco 
buying mca gives matsushita movies television shows and 
recordings to complement its consumer electronics products by 
controlling both the company assures itself a ready supply of 
programming compatible with any technological improvements that 
emerge 
the strategy was much discussed last year when sony purchased 
columbia pictures for 34 billion many analysts believe that 
sonys beta format for vcrs might have prevailed over matsushitas 
vhs if sony had owned columbia when the beta format first came out 
govideo already is pursuing its conspiracy claim in an earlier 
lawsuit against matsushita and its panasonic division victor co 
of japan ltd and its jvc corp subsidiary sanyo electric co 
ltd sony and nec corp 
govideo contends those companies unable to develop a machine 
that can compete with govideos conspired to block marketing of 
it and have formed a cartel to control such products as 
conventional vcrs digital audiotape recording equipment and 
highdefinition television 
govideo is seeking more than 1 billion from the companies in 
that action originally filed in 1987 it settled part of the suit 
out of court for 2 million the suit originally named 14 japanese 
and south korean companies as well as the motion picture

attempts to restructure the world 
trading system were suspended today after negotiators failed to end 
an impasse between the united states and the european community 
over reductions in farm subsidies 
squabbles between the americans and the europeans were so 
intense that some delegates feared worsening relations between the 
united states and the 12nation community 
the talks had been aimed at modernizing and expanding freetrade 
rules reaching an agreement could have doubled world trade from 
its current annual 38 trillion over the next decade according to 
a us estimate 
lowered tariffs could bring cheaper consumer prices on imported 
goods businesses and third world farm exporters could benefit from 
more openings to foreign markets proposed new rules could provide 
better protection against patent and copyright theft 
some officials held out hope for an eventual accord 
david woods spokesman for the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade or gatt said the 107nation group will pursue talks at a 
lower level in geneva 
the announcement was madeafter four days of unsuccessful 
efforts to overcome a dispute between the united states and the 
european community over farm supports 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said success in the 
next attempt is clearly going to require changes in the european 
position on agriculture without a significant and substantial 
change in that area we cannot bring this exercise to a 
conclusion 
ec agriculture secretary ray macsharry without naming the 
united states indirectly accused washington of pushing early in 
the weeklong conference for suspension in effect failure of the 
most ambitious attempt ever to revamp the world trading system 
i think too many people came here hoping to walk away 
macsharry said 
he added that the european communitys position would not 
change we have what we believe to be a very concrete proposal on 
the table 
indian commerce minister subramaniam swamy predicted a break of 
four to six weeks while an assessment of the situation is made at 
gatt headquarters in geneva 
the entire negotiations have been hijacked by one issue which 
became a bilateral issue swamy said 
the talks teetered between elation and despair thursday as hopes 
rose for a compromise proposal before the session ended in a bout 
of acrimony 
the key as it has been all week was farm subsidies the united 
states and its trade allies want the european community to make 
deep cuts in its farm supports as much as 75 percent to 90 
percent while the ec offered 30 percent cuts in one area seeking 
to protect the livelihood of 10 million farmers 
a compromise by the swedish chairman of the agriculture talks 
proposed 30 percent cuts in all areas 
the united states accepted the idea but ec members called it a 
monstrous proposal and a shocking paper said ec 
agriculture minister ray macsharry 
australian trade minister neal blewett allied with the united 
states on the issue said the ec position turned the session into 
a sort of farce 
delegates discussing trade in services gave up when they heard 
the farm talks had ended 
germanys economics minister helmut haussmann said it was 
very menacing to hear reports that the trade and economics 
dispute was spilling over into foreign relations between the united 
states and ec members 
after talking with us delegates haussmann said there were 
fears that traditionally friendly european relations with the 
united states might suffer 
analysts fear that a complete failure of the gatt talks called 
the uruguay round after the country where they started in 1986 
could mean a surge of protectionism and the creation of 
inwardlooking trading blocs 
the uruguay round is the eighth round of talks to update trade 
rules since world war ii gatt was founded in 1947

saturn corp officials are considering 
compensation for dealers who have received far fewer of the new 
cars than originally promised an official of the general motors 
corp subsidiary says 
a group made up of dealers and saturn production and marketing 
employees met wednesday at the companys spring hill tenn 
factory to discuss the launch of the line of small cars which 
officially went on sale in october 
since production of saleable cars began this summer saturns 
strict quality control system has resulted in a much slower 
production startup than originally planned 
that in turn has resulted in dealers opening with as few as 
one or two cars on their showroom floors and some dealers have 
been asked to delay opening their businesses from february to 
april 
a lot of information was shared at the meeting but there 
was no decision made on any of the retailers funding issues 
saturn spokesman don habarek said it still remains under 
review 
we left the meeting with a feeling our interests were 
protected said greg sutliff a saturn dealer from harrisburg 
pa 
theres no compensation offer said henry faulkner iii of 
philadelphia one of the saturn dealers who has delayed opening his 
business its a complex issue i wouldnt say anything other 
than we had a real candid discussion on a variety of issues 
saturn is a 3 billion project by gm to develop a new way to 
build cars in the united states borrowing heavily from japanese 
and european manufacturing methods 
the saturn cars are designed to compete with small japanese 
nameplate cars including the nissan sentra honda civic and toyota 
corolla also in that price range are gms geo prizm and the 
chevrolet cavalier both marketed by chevrolet dealers

fleetnorstar financial group plans to 
cut about 500 jobs by the end of the year an official of the 
banking company said today 
the layoffs will be scattered among fleets 1000 offices in 40 
states but will primarily affect workers in new england and new 
york said bank spokesman robert w lougee jr 
the cutbacks range from the top to the bottom of the 
organization he said some workers have already been notified 
and the others will receive pinkslips in the next few weeks he 
said 
fleet posted a small profit in the third quarter and was in the 
black for the first nine months of the year 
the providencebased bankholding company is being hit by the 
recession plaguing the northeast and blamed the slump for most of 
the layoffs 
obviously since much of the northeast if not nationally is 
in a recession at this point some of them the layoffs can be 
attributed to that lougee said 
other reductions were part of an ongoing consolidation since 
fleet financial group merged with norstar bankcorp of albany ny 
in 1988 
shortly after the merger fleetnorstar employed 19500 people 
today it employs 18000 lougee said 
some of the layoffs would have been done in the best of 
economic times he said we have consolidated irrespective of 
the economy over the last few years 
fleets thirdquarter earnings plummeted 601 percent from the 
same period a year ago to 385 million but it was enough to give 
the company a 434000 profit for the first nine months fleet 
posted a 2789 million profit for the januarythroughseptember 
period in 1989 
lougee said he would not guess on fleets profitability for the 
fourthquarter 
the work force reduction was expected to save the company about 
25 million next year before onetime costs such as severance and 
outplacement expenses fleet plans to eliminate an additional 75 
million in overhead expenses including marketing and advertising 
costs lougee said 
he said he did not expect any additional layoffs

the formula used to distribute federal health 
care money for the needy underpays poor states while favoring 
richer ones the general accounting office said today 
janet shikles of the congressional investigative agency told a 
house subcommittee that the current formula based on per capita 
income often fails to reflect the true level of poverty in a state 
shikles also said the formula does not account for the ability 
of states to raise revenues from business sources 
the formula does not target most federal funds to states with 
the greatest needs those with weak tax bases and high 
concentrations of poor people she told the government operations 
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations 
the government should shift to a formula using the number of 
people in poverty in a state combined with the total availability 
of taxable resources such as business earnings and dividends 
distributed to outofstate shareholders she said 
per capita income reflects the average of individual incomes 
the subcommittee is looking into the ability of state 
governments to pay the costs of medicaid the joint federalstate 
program to provide health care to the poor 
the federal government pays 55 percent of medical expenses 
while states pay the rest according to the gao the combined 
expenditures totaled 61 billion in 1989 
if the federal share had been cut to 40 percent and a revised 
formula used 33 billion of the federal share would have been 
shifted to the states the gao said that represents a shift of 17 
percent of all federal medicaid payments for the year 
nine states each would have received 100 million or more in 
additional funds as a result of the shift arkansas california 
florida georgia kentucky mississippi new york tennessee and 
texas 
a dozen states mostly in the northeast and midwest each would 
have had payments reduced by more than 100 million they are 
connecticut illinois indiana iowa maryland massachusetts 
michigan minnesota new jersey ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin 
the gao first recommended changing the formula in 1983 and 
since then congress has authorized a substitute formula for 
allocating mental health and drug treatment grants said shikles 
director of health financing and policy issues at the agency 
the subcommittee has resurrected the issue because of the 
soaring costs of health care combined with the economic downturn 
and limited federal dollars 
about 26 million people are eligible according to subcommittee 
data but 13 states are being sued by hospitals and nursing homes 
that allege medicaid payment rates are too low to cover the cost of 
doing business 
the gao said five states alaska louisiana new mexico texas 
and wyoming have high taxable resources that are disguised by the 
per capita income figures in five others florida maryland new 
hampshire pennsylvania and rhode island taxable resources are 
not as high as the per capita figures would suggest it said 
the consequence is that the federal share of medicaid in 
states whose financing capacity is overstated by using per capita 
income is too low shikles said 
the current formula is also misleading because two states with 
the same per capita income can have differing poverty rates she 
said 
per capita income in utah and arkansas is 11000 but utah has 
a 20 percent poverty rate and arkansas has a 32 percent according 
to gao data

japanese officials today denied accusations by a 
senior us energy department official that japan has been hoarding 
crude oil in defiance of an agreement among major consuming nations 
to draw down stockpiles 
this is a complete misunderstanding a senior government 
official said we are not stockpiling 
linda stuntz a us energy department under secretary for 
policy and planning told reporters in washington that in the 
months following iraqs invasion of kuwait japan increased imports 
to meet additional demand instead of drawing down stocks 
she noted that japan imported 33 percent more oil in october 
than it did in july and said such actions raised doubts about 
future cooperative activities among consuming nations in response 
to oil supply shocks 
the united states and other consumer nations have sought to ease 
the immediate shock of losing 43 million barrels of oil a day as a 
result of the iraqi invasion by minimizing imports stockpiling oil 
would contradict such efforts and would put upward pressure on oil 
prices 
officials in japans foreign ministry and the ministry of 
international trade and industry said that instead of increasing 
stocks as planned japanese oil companies had actually drawn down 
stocks 
increased imports however were needed during cool winter 
months to compensate for higher demand for heating fuel 
the amount of oil imported by japan fluctuates by 20 to 30 
percent every month depending on seasonal factors every year its 
exactly the same pattern said the government official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
stuntzs charge that japan was betraying other oil consuming 
nations by not drawing down its 142day emergency supply 
disregarded the fact that the united states is the only country 
that has tried to rely on existing stocks officials said 
no other country has drawn from its emergency stock and 
theres no reason why japan should the government official said 
i cant imagine why shes saying that its a complete 
mistake he said since august our stocks have been kept at a 
142day supply 
in fact the level of the stockpile increased slightly between 
june and october the most recent month for which statistics are 
available but the growth from a total of 337 million kiloliters 
to 339 million kiloliters or about onethird of japans daily 
consumption isnt considered significant 
japan also has increased crude oil imports to a certain extent 
to compensate for shortfalls in supplies of refined oil products 
due to the loss of kuwaits refining system industry sources 
noted 
weve brought in more oil but less product said naoki 
kuroda director general of the international trade and industy 
ministrys petroleum department 
japan imports nearly all the oil it uses and 70 percent of its 
oil imports come from the middle east

kroger co says it has received so few 
responses in a bondexchange program to reduce its 14 billion 
bond debt that it will extend the deadline for replies until dec 
20 
the program was to have ended on tuesday 
the grocery giant offered nov 5 to let holders of bonds that 
begin paying 155 percent annual interest in october 1993 trade 
them in for bonds that pay 13 percent immediately 
kroger which owns supermarkets convenience stores and food 
processing plants in 32 states issued the bonds during a 
multibillion restructuring that began in 1988 after two hostile 
takeover attempts 
kroger said thursday that bondholders had offered to trade in 
less than 150 million in bonds the company said it had hoped to 
exchange 350 million in bonds 
bondholders appear to be avoiding the exchange because the 
higheryield bonds have been increasing in value said ross 
margolies an analyst for shearson lehman hutton 
unless the market changes dramatically i think most people 
are happy with the bonds margolies said 
krogers interest costs for the 350 million in bonds it hoped 
to exchange would be 542 million at the higher interest rate in 
1994 at the lower rate the companys interest costs would be cut 
to 312 million

japanese companies were selected friday for a 
contract to build a peoplemover system at the new kansai airport 
the contract had been the focus of us complaints over access to 
japans construction market 
kansai international airport co said it awarded the 377 
million contract to niigata engineering co and sumitomo corp 
under the contract the two companies will build a system to 
carry passengers to faraway gates at the 7 billion airport 
scheduled to open in 1994 
aeg westinghouse transportation systems headquartered in 
pittsburgh had disputed the bidding for the contract complaining 
that us construction firms did not have fair access to the 
japanese market 
westinghouse was one of the 13 bidders 
the airport company announced in july that the contract for an 
automated guideway transport system in the passenger terminal 
building also would be awarded to niigata engineering and sumitomo 
westinghouse said there were irregularities in the decision to 
give japanese bidders the peoplemover contract the airport 
company maintained that the procedure had been fair 
as part of a longstanding trade dispute japan and the united 
states reached an agreement in 1988 on procedures to allow american 
builders to bid on construction projects in japan including the 
kansai airport 
us officials said later japan was making significant progress 
in allowing american companies to compete for construction 
projects

a handful of banks took steps today to cut the 
prime rate by a quarter percentage point to 9 percent marking the 
first time the key lending rate has been lowered in nearly a year 
the biggest institution so far to trim the rate which is a base 
for setting a wide range of loans like mortgages was first 
fidelity bancorp the nations 20th largest bank and the largest 
bank in new jersey the lower rate will be effective on monday 
analysts said they expected other major banks to follow its 
virtually certain the banking industry will go to 9 percent 
probably by early next week said william sullivan director of 
money market research at dean witter reynolds inc 
the prime rate reflects a banks cost of borrowing money and is 
used in calculating business and consumer loans major banks last 
cut the rate by 05 percent to 10 percent on jan 8 
the cut came on the heels of an extremely weak employment report 
by the labor department in washington which showed a 02 percent 
increase in the civilian unemployment rate to 59 percent and 
offered particularly strong evidence that a recession has firmly 
taken hold 
the employment report was extremely weak and suggests that the 
federal reserve will step up the pace of accommodation sullivan 
said he also said that the report could trigger fairly sharp 
declines in shortterm money market rates and that translates to 
further downward pressure on the prime rate 
economists have been waiting for the fed to lower interest rates 
to stimulate the economy the fed took some action today to notch 
rates lower by allowing the federal funds rate the rate banks 
charge each other on overnight loans to drift down by a quarter of 
a percentage point to 7 percent in addition the central bank 
said it would inject money into the banking system later in the 
afternoon to encourage bank to make more funds available 
government officials have beseeched the nations banks in recent 
weeks to broaden lending practices rather than continue to tighten 
credit and choke off customers in need of funds 
southwest bank of st louis which had carved out a reputation 
for taking the lead in cutting rates was the first to announce it 
was lowering prime effective monday manufacturers amp traders trust 
of buffalo a unit of first empire state corp mimicked the move a 
few hours later 
while known as a ratecutting maverick of sorts southwest has 
not always been followed in late 1989 for example southwest 
stood alone after trimming its prime rate from 105 percent to 10 
percent when no other banks followed southwest quietly notched 
the rate back up three weeks later 
we think our commercial customers are entitled to some 
benefits from this recent trend toward lower interest rates col

economic times he said we have consolidated irrespective of 
the economy over the last few years

and the others will receive notice in the next few weeks lougee 
said 
fleets thirdquarter earnings plummeted 601 percent from the 
same period a year ago to 385 million while the company eked out

the oil crisis brought on by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait has pretty much run its course and there will probably be 
no reason for crude prices to jump even if war breaks out energy 
secretary james watkins said friday 
from an energy perspective i believe we are through the worst 
of the crisis watkins said a day after returning from a visit to 
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates 
watkins said a war with iraq should not cause concern among oil 
buyers because he sees no military threat to middle east production 
facilities and he plans to ask president bush to tap into the us 
strategic petroleum reserve if hostilities break out the 
government recently conducted test sales of oil from the reserve 
that went smoothly the secretary said 
it works and works well watkins said in an address to the 
jewish community relations council of new york 
some oil experts have estimated that crude prices could shoot as 
high as 100 per barrel if war breaks out but watkins said that if 
hostilities develop i hope players in the oil market will keep 
their hats on 
a combination of higher oil production and conservation has 
virtually eliminated the shortfall of 43 million barrels per day 
created by the global boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
implemented after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 he said 
after the invasion fears of supply disruptions in the event of 
war pushed oil above 40 per barrel although it has since fallen 
back to less than 30 as world production was increased and 
international leaders have adopted a more conciliatory stance in 
recent days 
light sweet crude oil closed friday at 2658 per barrel up 18 
cents for january delivery contracts at the new york mercantile 
exchange 
watkins said he doubted the iraqis could harm oil facilities 
since they were unable to cripple irans oil production during 
their drawnout war of the 1980s the secretary who is a retired 
admiral said he went to the persian gulf for his visit of almost a 
week to get a firsthand look at the security of the oil supply 
i do not believe the iraqi air force is a threat to saudi or 
uae fields nor can i imagine a successful iraqi ground attack 
watkins said even if there were some kind of unpredictable cutoff 
we would still have six weeks worth of oil in the water 
he was referring to the lag time in shipping crude from the 
middle east to the united states 
watkins said the world is already experiencing an oil glut that 
will only intensify after the crisis ends he said it might provide 
an opportunity for the united states to expand the strategic 
reserve where the government stores millions of barrels of crude 
oil in texas and louisiana salt caverns 
we want to go from the current 590 million barrels in our 
strategic petroleum reserve to a billion barrels he said 
during a session friday afternoon with reporters watkins said 
the united states was continuing discussions with producing nations 
who might want to lease oil for the strategic petroluem reserve 
once the crisis ends under that arrangement the united states 
would pay a small fee as the producing nations put oil into the 
salt caverns 
later the oil could be auctioned off by the government in the 
same manner existing reserves are set to be auctioned

coffeetrading nations on friday failed to make 
progress on a new international agreement to lift and stabilize 
depressed world coffee prices 
delegates said colombia and several african countries renewed 
their call for a speedy start to negotiations on a new accord to 
regulate exports and prices 
they provided figures showing a sharp drop in export earnings 
said nestor osorio colombias delegate to the international coffee 
organizations 16nation executive board 
but brazil the worlds largest coffee producer and exporter 
said it was not ready to enter talks on a new pact the board thus 
decided it could not set a timetable for negotiations to begin 
delegates said 
the former international coffee agreement was abandoned in july 
1988 opening the way to a flood of sales and a drop in prices 
coffee prices last year hit a 14year low of 59 cents per pound 
half the amount the agreement had tried to guarantee 
on friday coffee was priced at 71 cents a pound 
figures released by the organization friday showed a sharp rise 
in export volume but a dramatic drop in earnings in the last 
international coffee marketing year 
world shipments of beans between october 1989 and september 1990 
rose to 7889 million 132pound bags from 7087 million bags the 
previous year 
export earnings slumped to 652 billion from 915 billion the 
previous year earnings peaked at 1436 billion in the 19851986

shaken by a worsethanexpected us unemployment report and 
falling interest rates 
gold prices also lost ground on the new york commodity

republic national bank quoted a late bid for gold at 36930 an 
ounce off 170 
the dollar declined overseas and opened on a very weak note when 
trading shifted to domestic markets a labor department report 
showing civilian unemployment jumped 02 percent in november to 59 
percent its worst level in three years got the market moving 
said stephen flanagan a vice president at mitsubishi bank ltd 
the report offered indisputable evidence the nation has slipped 
into a recession and prompted the federal reserve and a handful of 
banks to take steps to ease interest rates 
lower interest rates make dollardenominated securities less 
valuable and therefore reduce investors need for the us 
currency 
there were unconfirmed reports that the fed stepped in to 
support the dollar against the german mark flanagan said adding 
that the dollar did move up after the rumored intervention 
but traders are expecting interest rate differentials to become 
more unfavrrable for the dollar as us rates decline while some 
key foreign rates remain steady that would put further pressure on 
the dollar 
also pushing the dollar down was an easing of tensions in the 
persian gulf conflict following iraqi president saddam husseins 
offer to release all hostages

like an invading virus the regional real estate slump is now a 
nationwide affliction making memories out of workswamped 
california builders 30minute seattle home sales and florida 
condos crawling with prospective retirees 
further darkening the picture property experts say are 
indications that the sickly northeasts real estate industry has 
slipped even further with rentals now following the steep price 
declines once confined to forsale units 
new york is close to being a housing depression said robert 
villanueva economic forecaster for the national association of 
home builders 
not everyone is dejected of course prospective buyers and 
renters can get great deals moreover a few sections of the 
country such as texas are just now bouncing back from earlier 
downturns 
but the slumps in once prosperous holdouts has forced developers 
and real estate agencies to lay off thousands of employees and has 
stranded many homeowners with expensive properties they cant sell 
without taking a loss 
the grim news is told in recent statistics and in war stories 
from participants 
in its first decline in more than a decade of nearly 
uninterrupted growth housing starts in california plunged nearly 
30 percent this year roughly twice the national rate the national 
association of home builders says 
auctions once associated with debtswamped farmers now account 
for more than 50 percent of southern california home sales by some 
reckonings 
the problem particularly in southern california is that 
developers built too many luxury homes in their zeal to exploit the 
states burgeoning population and affluence 
its a case of oversupply and not an equal demand saidterry 
yapp a real estate agent in mission viejo an affluent suburb 60 
miles south of los angeles 
thousands of california property brokers are expected to leave 
the business by the en of the year century 21 a leading 
homeseller closed about 30 of its southern california offices this 
year 
in its first auction of unsold housing units kaufman amp broad 
home corp one of californias largest home builders last month 
sold 36 luxury homes for roughly 25 percent less than their 
original asking prices of 350000375000 
were not exactly on the average brokers christmas card 
list said william lange president of lang financial corp 
which conducted the auction 
seattles reputation as one of the nations most livable cities 
drew tens of thousands in the last five years but in 1990 housing 
prices plummeted 15 percent after rising 30 percent to 40 percent 
annually in recent years said charles henderson president of 
henderson homes a major seattle home builder 
in january it took 30 minutes to sell a home after it was 
put on market he said now it takes price cuts and months of 
waiting to lure wary buyers 
floridas boom has been zapped partly because northeasterners 
are having so much trouble selling homes this means the supply of 
people seeking to move to florida upon retirement has dried up 
also hurting sales florida builders say are recent state 
regulations requiring the building of roads sewers and other 
infrastructures before housing is approved 
moreover many banks have tightened credit restrictions making 
it exceedingly difficult for builders to finance new developments 
we have felt it dramatically a number of our banks have gone 
out of business said ronald s ellish who owns a small florida 
building firm 
ryan homes once one of the states largest home builders 
recently withdrew from the state because it wasnt making money 
the suburban washington dcbased company has said 
in south floridas lee county one of the states fastest 
growing regions in the last year alone we have lost over 1000 
employees in the construction industry said michael reitmann 
executive vice president of the countys building industry 
association 
one of the more visible signs of the times is the planned 
auction on dec 16 of units in donald trumps 32story trump plaza 
in west palm beach where bidding for the luxury condominiums and 
town homes starts at half of the original 300000 asking price 
the situation is familiar to many new yorkers who for the past 
two years have grimly watched their manhattan homes plummet in 
value 
joe mandese 32 a journalist says he and his wife placed their 
greenwich village studio on the market in 1988 for roughly 
125000 two years after they bought it for 100000 now they 
would be grateful to get 89500 for it 
on the other hand many manhattan renters are benefiting from 
owner misery 
for the first time since the great depression rents in the five 
boroughs are dropping driven down by an oversupply of rental units 
caused partly by owners renting out their property rather than 
selling at a loss 
a luxury studio on swank central park south for example which 
rented in april 1988 for 1900 a month recently was let for 
1150 according to the feathered nest a manhattan property 
agency

the federal reserve and a handful of banks moved 
friday to cut interest rates after the government reported the 
biggest jobless increase in three years graphic evidence that a 
recession is sapping the nations economic strength 
for the third time in six weeks the nations central took subtle 
steps to make more money available for banks to lend the move also 
raised speculation that the fed might take even more dramatic steps 
later to reduce the cost of borrowing to stimulate economic growth 
in addition three banks cut the prime lending rate for the 
first time in nearly a year nudging it to 9 percent from 10 
percent the prime rate is a base used by banks for pricing a range 
of businesses and consumer loans including many types of 
mortgages 
a reduction in the prime means that many people who may have 
delayed the purchase of a home or car for example would 
reconsider because a loan is more affordable 
the rate cut effective monday raised anticipation that others 
would follow william sullivan director of money market research 
at dean witter reynolds inc predicted the 9 percent will become 
the industrywide benchmark by early next week 
the largest bank to trim the prime was first fidelity bancorp 
the nations 20th largest banking company and the largest bank in 
new jersey also announcing cuts were manufacturers amp traders trust 
of buffalo ny and southwest bank of st louis historically a 
maverick ratecutter 
major banks last cut the rate by 05 percent to 10 percent on 
jan 8 
still analysts said major banks remain concerned about their 
profit margins and were hesitating to mark rates down until they 
had a sense the fed would act in tandem 
indications that the fed was allowing rates to drift lower 
surfaced around midday the federal funds rate the rate banks 
charge each other on overnight loans stood at 7 116 percent down 
from 7 716 percent earlier in the week 
the shift in fed policy was confirmed a bit later when the 
central bank announced it was injecting 15 billion into the 
banking system a move designed to encourage banks to make funds 
more available 
tthe infusion of reserves was a clear signal by the fed that 
it has eased monetary policy sullivan said 
but many economists criticized the feds reluctance to take 
stronger action immediately they complained that the nation was 
sliding toward a needlessly severe recession because interest rates 
havent come down quickly 
there is a lot of dissension within the fed about what the 
right policy is and the fed has been slow to accept that the 
economy is in recession said robert brusca chief economist at 
nikko securities co international inc 
a labor department report issued friday appeared to be the 
decisive piece of evidence that convinced recalcitrant observers 
that the nation is in the throes of a recession the report showed 
the unemployment rate climbed 02 percent to 59 percent in 
november the highest level in three years 
no doubt this figure will resurrect the economy as a political 
issue sullivan said it is clear from the employment report 
that the economy has lost a substantial amount of momentum the 
figure not only points to weakness in the job market but also 
suggests deterioration in production and income growth 
government officials have beseeched the nations banks in recent 
weeks to broaden lending practices rather than continue to tighten 
credit and choke off customers in need of funds 
while cuts in the prime rate which reflects a banks cost of 
borrowing money are expected to be held to a quarter of a 
percentage point analysts say still lower rates are likely 
some economists believe the fed will cut another key rate the 
discount rate or the rate it charges on loans to member banks by 
05 percent sometime around the new year that would be the first 
change in the discount rate since feb 24 1989 when it moved from 
65 percent to 7 percent and it likely would result in a further 
prime rate cut by the nations banks

lawyers for thousands of asbestos disease 
victims on friday fought a compensation plan by eaglepicher 
industries inc that would mark a key step in ending the biggest 
product liability mess clogging the courts 
the lawyers charged the 625 million plan allocates too little 
money for workers suffering cancer and other respiratory diseases 
and could further delay payments to 65000 claimants for five or 
more years 
eaglepicher is widely considered a test case in efforts to 
resolve the ilemma of compensating american workers ill and dying 
from exposure to asbestos a mineral used for decades in shipyards 
and construction 
us district judge jack b weinstein wants the company and 
plaintiffs lawyers to reach a settlement so he can declare a 
classaction to handle all the cases at once eliminating long and 
costly trials that are diverting money that could be used to pay 
victims 
under an agreement between the company and two plaintiffs 
lawyers claimants would be paid from a trust funded with annual 
cash payments by eaglepicher and company stock the total value of 
the trust over 20 years was placed at about 625 million plus at 
least 25 percent of the companys shares 
but other plaintiffs lawyers urged weinstein to reject the plan 
saying financially tottering eaglepicher might be worth more to 
victims if it declares chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection 
i say theres too much delay in this agreement and not enough 
remedies said henry g miller one of four attorneys appointed 
by weinstein to represent claimants two backed the plan and two 
opposed it 
the plan provides that payments to victims would begin in 
november 1993 at the soonest and could be delayed by court 
appeals eaglepicher would pay 460 million spread out over 20 
years 45 million for already negotiated claims and an estimated 
120 million in proceeds from the companys operations 
eagle picher chairman thomas e petry said if no settlement is 
reached i believe well be in bankruptcy 
we are within days of a cash squeeze a cash crisis he 
said 
eaglepicher a cincinnatibased maker of automobile and 
industrial products has said it cannot meet its asbestos 
liabilities now estimated at 600 million it already has spent 
540 million in the last five years on asbestos obligations 
but miller told the judge that in contrast to eaglepicher 
estimates the estimated present value of the proposal for asbestos 
victims was at most 244 million while chapter 11 could provide 
296 million he also said the plan lacked safeguards for victims 
should the company go under 
weinstein has supported a mass settlement to clear court dockets 
nationwide of about 90000 asbestos lawsuits which has put a 
severe drain on dozens of companies threatened by asbestos 
liabilities 
but at a crowded hearing in federal court in brooklyn some 
attorneys accused weinstein of trying to railroad a plan through 
the courts and said he was flouting judicial procedure 
they also accused the courtappointed attorneys who devised the 
plan stanley chesley of cincinnati and david i shapiro of 
washington of selling out victims in exchange for a quick 
resolution 
my clients will have more insults heaped upon them that the 
insults they have already received at the hands of eaglepicher 
said gene locks a philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer who criticized 
the plan 
locks called the process for reaching a settlement publicly 
embarrassing and promised to fight a settlement through appeals 
but chesley told the judge the plan was far better than a 
bankruptcy filing because the longterm value to victims depended 
on eaglepichers future success 
eaglepicher has sold tens of millions of dollars in assets in 
recent years to meet asbestos payments but the settlements 
backers said the company has little left to sell its insurance is 
running out and it woon wont be able to generate enough cash from 
operations to meet obligations 
dozens of former asbestos makers and users are scrutinizing the 
case which could become a model for companies to resolve asbestos 
liabilities payments to victims have been delayed years and many 
workers have died before getting money 
a separate case involves the manville trust fund created in the 
bankruptcy reorganization of manville corp earlier this year the 
trust ran out of money to pay new claims a proposal to restructure 
the trust which faces 130000 claims is pending before weinstein

when the bond buyer held a conference at the 
manhattans plaza hotel in honor of the financial publications 
100th anniversary last month the black tie affair looked something 
like a mayors convention 
government officials from roughly 30 municipalities ranging from 
delaware to detroit came to town in the hope they might woo 
investors to buy their municipal bonds 
such hardsell scenes are becoming more and more frequent these 
days with the nations widely reported economic downturn placing 
many municipalities on shaky financial ground government officials 
increasingly are renting out plush convention space and polishing 
their pitches to put their cities best foot forward 
they have their work cut out for them in the first nine months 
of 1990 standard amp poors corp downgraded 285 municipal bonds and 
upgraded 111 
the underlying concept is that its better to hear it straight 
from the horses mouth rather than to read an article scaring you 
its the only way you get a chance to personally assess the 
management qualities of a city or state said claire cohen 
executive managing director for government finance at fitch 
investors service 
for example late last month new york city mayor david dinkins 
head of the biggest municipal bond borrower in the world feted 
potential buyers at a swank conference in a midtown manhattan 
hotel 
the affair came several weeks in advance of the citys 950 
million sale of general obligation bonds needed to keep the 
government running and investors had some hard questions on how 
the city proposed to balance its budget and pay its future debt 
while moodys investor service rates new yorks bonds a fairly 
respectable a the citys big budget deficit has prompted worries 
among investors that the rating could be lowered 
but cities have quickly discovered the art of bond salesmanship 
is different than say selling used cars 
they have learned that they had better be very very honest 
and forthright because many investors and dealers can read a 
financial statement just as well as anyone in the administration 
can said john v sebastian chief economist for clayton brown amp 
associates a chicagobased public securities firm 
investors are sometimes reticent to have their biggest concerns 
addressed in public so municipalities are looking for 
opportunities to maximize private interaction 
at the conference sponsored by the bond buyer trade newspaper 
you would have a casual opportunity during coffee breaks or 
between sessions to go up to public officials and have 
conversations about whatever was on your mind said ms cohen of 
fitch 
another way cities are selling themselves is by sharpening their 
pencils 
ten years ago new york city would simply issue one to two 
sheets of paper telling what financing they are planning and what 
they are raising and their scheduling of repayment said 
sebastian the economist 
now many large cities are issuing sophisticated fiscal reports 
showing everything from cash flow to projected income he said not 
unlike the comprehensive annual reports corporations issue to 
stockholders 
but sometimes all the slick salesmanship in the world cant 
change investors minds last month for example moodys investor 
service demoted two more series of philadelphias municipal bonds 
to junkbond status the move came after the citys general 
obligation bonds were dropped in september to junkbond level by 
the rating services 
we have conceded that we have no capacity to reenter the 
market said betsy reveal philadelphias director of finance 
the city now has the lowest credit rating of any major municipal 
borrower trying to avoid insolvency without the bond markets 
help the city is trying to wrangle an unusual transaction that 
involves borrowing from local and state pension funds and local 
banks to secure shortterm cash to keep the government running

maybe they should change the name to goya 
feuds 
a 20yearold family squabble has spilled into court at goya 
foods inc which grew from a small puerto rican rice bean and 
spice business into a 300 millionayear food empire 
at issue is the will of prudencio unanue the family patriarch 
who founded goya more than 50 years ago his son is suing other 
family members and says hundreds of millions of dollars are at 
stake 
after a tax dispute with other family members charles unanue 
walked away from goya in 1974 with a 43 million settlement and an 
agreement not to seek any inheritance from his father 
prudencio unanue died in 1976 leaving his 18 grandchildren 
controlling interest in the company but under puerto rican 
commonwealth law parents are not allowed to disinherit their 
children charles unanue says he agreed not to seek an inheritance 
while his father was living in puerto rico so the will doesnt 
stand 
there is no moral question here jan brodey charles 
unanues attorney said charlie believes that if hes entitled 
by right to inherit from his father then he has a right to it 
period 
attorneys for goya and the other family members dispute the 
claim 
a state superior court judge in hackensack was to rule on the 
legality of prudencios will but a decision was put on hold when 
charles filed for personal bankruptcy in puerto rico in august 
under federal law lawsuits involving people who file for 
bankruptcy are delayed until the court decides whether they can 
continue 
the internal dispute at goya appears to have done little to 
tarnish the success of the nations largest hispanicowned 
business 
founded by prudencio unanue in 1936 goya started out importing 
sardines beans and olive oil now the familys frozen vegetables 
and canned goods are found from corner bodegas in manhattan to 
swanky miami supermarkets 
goya which has operations in chicago miami spain and the 
dominican republic dominates the sale of caribbean and spanish 
foods in the eastern united states and caribbean 
analysts said goya based in secaucus has been the largest 
hispanicowned company since rum manufacturer bacardi corp of 
puerto rico and banco popular de puerto rico became publicly held 
operations 
if there have been problems they havent hurt the overall 
success of the company said leonard teitelbaum an analyst with 
merrill lynch amp co it may have been more successful had it not 
been for the problems but it has still done quite well 
the dispute began nearly 20 years ago when charles unanue 
claimed goya was cheating on its taxes he threatened legal action 
the family settled out of court and charles agreed to take 43 
million and forsake any claim to an inheritance 
brodey said charles unanue was largely responsible for the 
companys success and didnt want to be associated with any legal 
action against it 
so they dumped him brodey said but it wasnt like he was 
collecting any money that wasnt his what he was given was what 
they determined his share of the company was 
the alleged tax violations never were brought into criminal or 
civil proceedings 
unanue claims he only recently learned about the puerto rican 
law barring parents from disinherting children and he has moved to 
have his fathers will reprobated in puerto rico 
michael griffinger an attorney for goya and the unanue family 
said charles unanues claim that several hundred millions of 
dollars are at stake is exaggerated but he conceded that a large 
amount of money is in dispute 
griffinger said the family has been absolutely harmonious and 
unified except for charles 
the family felt he wasnt pulling his load he said there 
were a number of meetings and discussions and he said he wanted to 
be bought out every bit of litigation with charles was settled 
and now hes coming back looking for more

precious metals on friday continued their slide on new yorks 
commodity exchange paced by a sharp drop in platinum prices that 
was caused by a jump in us unemployment 
silver prices were also hard hit at one point tumbling to 
contract lows both platinum and silver are heavily used in 
industry 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mostly lower 
copper futures dropped livestock and pork futures were higher and 
energy futures gained 
the selloff in platinum came after the release of unemployment 
figures by the us labor department showing joblessness in 
november reached a threeyear high of 59 percent 
platinum settled 790 to 850 lower with the contract for 
delivery in january at 41340 a troy ounce 
peter cardillo an analyst with jesup josephthal amp co inc in 
new york said the silver market also was sharply affected by the 
decline in employment 
platinum is used in the catalytic converters of automobiles and 
in jewelry silver is both a luxury item and is used in the 
photography industry 
if you have a recessionary atmosphere it dampens the future 
prospects of the metal cardillo said 
the unemployment figures gave some support to the gold market 
gold is usually a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty but 
the imminent release of hostages in iraq and the resulting 
perceptions of peace weighed on gold futures analysts said 
gold was 110 to 190 lower with february at 37210 a troy 
ounce silver was 62 cents to 78 cents lower with december at 
4055 a troy ounce 
recessionary fears also forced copper prices lower on the comex 
copper was 145 cents to 310 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in december at 11015 a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade as a lack of news on us aid to the soviet 
union took its toll on the market 
the market has been awaiting announcement that the united states 
will extend about 12 billion in export credits to the soviet 
union so that nation can buy us farm products however nothing 
has come of talks between soviet officials and the us agriculture 
department 
analysts also noted that the market was hurt by the failure of 
general agreement on tariffs and trade talks in brussels 
wheat futures showed gains on aggressive buying by commercial 
houses and by egypts purchase of 200000 metric tons of soft white 
wheat under the export bonus program said paul sylvester an 
analyst with gerald inc in chicago 
wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 253 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 
a cent higher with december at 226 a bushel oats were a cent 
to 1 cents lower with december at 110 a bushel soybeans were 1 
cents to 4 cents lower with january at 595 a bushel 
energy futures posted modest gains on the new york mercantile 
exchange with traders citing the lack of new middle east 
developments for quiet trading 
jim ritterbusch an analyst with painewebber inc in chicago 
said the huge drops in futures prices caused by expectations the 
persian gulf crisis will be resolved peacefully brought in some 
buying interest

oil prices showed little change friday as 
traders paused to wonder what crude might do next after a dramatic 
weeklong slide based on perceptions that peace could break out in 
the persian gulf 
when the market moves like this one has it tends to get a 
little bit overdone and then moves back said brian tagler an 
oil broker with shearson lehman brothers inc 
light sweet crude oil rose 18 cents to 2658 per barrel at the 
new york mercantile exchange on contracts for delivery in january 
for the week oil was down 227 per barrel for nextmonth 
delivery after a big fall of 406 per barrel on nov 30 this 
weeks losses dropped oil into a price range it had not seen since 
august the month iraq invaded kuwait 
crudes fall also brought unleaded gasoline futures down to 
ugust levels the dive began last week when president bush offered 
to hold toplevel diplomatic sessions with the iraqis 
oil kept falling this week first when iraq accepted the offer 
and later when iraqi president saddam hussein announced plans to 
free all of his hostages 
oil traders said the market seemed due for its its slight bounce 
up on friday and some were surprised it didnt rise even more 
we came down awfully fast over the past couple of days and 
this is a little bit of a correction said thomas p blakeslee 
an energy analyst with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken 
nj even though theres new peace hopes you have to look at 
them with a grain of salt 
futures contracts for home heating oil and unleaded gasoline 
were mixed though none of them moved by as much as 1 cent a 
gallon some traders were selling heating oil contracts and buying 
unleaded gasoline contracts just because gasoline seemed like a 
relative bargain at about 12 cents a gallon cheaper than the 
heating oil blakeslee said 
heating oil closed down 54 cent at 7917 cents a gallon for 
january delivery unleaded gasoline was down 13 cent at 6647 
cents a gallon for january delivery 
for the week unleaded gasoline fell 1111 cents a gallon for 
nextmonth delivery while home heating oil fell 670 cents a 
gallon

the persian gulf also showed little direction friday the january 
delivery contract fell 1 cent to 2350 per 1000 cubic feet for 
the week gas dropped 95 cents for january delivery

practically all the nations industries have been affected 
this report looks like a recession it walks like a recession 
it is a recession said allen sinai chief economist at the

in apparent response the federal reserve moved to stimulate the

the negative momentum is not yet spent we are in the 
heart of the downturn now there is no turning back it cannot be 
reversed the question is how deep and how long will it last 
sinai said 
added robert brusca of nikko securities co 
this recession looks about as bad as any recession can look 
it deepened in november the pace has accelerated 
we have a vicious cycle going here the more people you lay

million during its first quarter as the retailers sales hurt by 
the weakening economy and the middle eat crisis tumbled nearly 10 
percent 
the closely held macy which is still paying the costs of a 1986 
leveraged buyout said its loss in the quarter ended oct 27 
translated to 3853 per share and compared with a shortfall of 
331 million or 2392 per share in the same period a year 
earlier 
macys results in the latest quarter reflected a 102 million 
gain related to a repurchase of some of the retailers bonds 
the results contained a quarterly filing with the securities 
and exchange commission were expected after published reports said 
macys firstquarter loss nearly doubled from a year earlier 
the company said its firstquarter sales declined to 155 
billion from 171 billion 
macy suffered from the same dropoff in business that struck 
other retailers after the middle east crisis erupted in early 
august consumers already spending cautiously because of the 
weakening economy put purchases of nonessentials such as 
clothing appliances and furniture on hold as oil prices shot 
higher 
macy said its performance was also adversely affected by 
warmerthanusual weather that slowed apparel sales the company 
said its sales were particularly hard hit in the northeast where 
the economy has weakened considerably 
the retailer has come under sharp scrutiny after it suffered a 
disastrous christmas season a year ago the current holiday season 
is proving to be difficult for all retailers but macy spokesman 
james fingeroth said friday the company so far has not been forced 
to make steep markdowns to bring in sales 
macy has taken a number of steps to reduce its debt load and its 
losses including the sale of stock and buybacks of some of the 
junk bonds used to finance its 374 billion leveraged buyout 
the company is also selling its credit operations to ge capital 
corp in its filing friday macy said it expected that sale to be 
completed by february 
in the filing macy listed its debt at the end of the fiscal 
year at 432 billion the retailer expects after accounting for 
asset sales and bond buybacks to be left with 3 billion in 
longterm liabilities

a jury friday awarded 6 million to a state 
supreme court justice saying the philadelphia inquirer defamed him 
in a reprint of a 1983 series about the courts conduct 
the jury which deliberated nine hours over two days following a 
sevenweek trial found the reprint was false and defamatory but 
that the original series was not false 
the verdict is bizarre because they said the articles 
themselves were true but they were false when they were 
reprinted said william hangley the inquirers lawyer 
hangley suggested the jury may have considered an editorial and 
cartoon also included in the tabloid reprint 
he said the paper will appeal 
we are confident this result cannot stand he said 
the jurors refused to comment after the verdict 
the award was the second libel judgment against the inquirer 
this year 
common pleas court judge john lavelle had told the jury that 
justice james t mcdermott had to prove the articles written by 
reporter daniel biddle were defamatory false and published with 
actual malice and that he suffered harm 
the inquirer has won 17 pulitzer prizes during the past two 
decades including one by biddle for another court series 
last may a jury awarded philadelphia lawyer richard sprague a 
record 34 million over a 1973 story that criticized his handling 
of a homicide case when he was an assistant district attorney the 
inquirer is appealing 
the 64yearold mcdermott a member of the states highest court 
since january 1982 sued on grounds the articles titled above the 
law implied he fixed cases 
the articles were published in may 1983 and reprinted in 1984 to 
distribute to journalism and law schools 
the reprints subheaded the questionable conduct of the 
supreme court claimed many of the justices ignored the 
pennsylvania code of judicial ethics which the court adopted in 
1974 
the articles suggested mcdermott shouldnt have participated in 
two cases involving lawyers from the dilworth paxson kalish amp 
kauffman firm which had been the largest contributor to his 1981 
election because it was a conflict of interest 
the articles noted mcdermott accepted 6100 from the 
philadelphia law firm that one of the firms lawyers had arranged 
a 1981 trip to the pennsylvania coal region and three months after 
the justice took his seat on the court he voted favorably for 
dilworth clients 
in asking the jury to find in favor of the newspaper hangley 
declared we say that justice mcdermott did something wrong that 
he didnt abide by the pennsylvania code of judicial conduct 
did we say he committed a crime no has he fixed a case 
no hangley said but he did ignore the code that says he 
shouldnt have participated in cases where his partiality is 
questioned 
mcdermotts lawyer james beasley argued that accusing the 
justice of being partial thats accusing him of a crime 
besides the two cases involving dilworth lawyers mcdermott also 
claimed he was defamed when the newspaper implied he had improperly 
used his judicial influence to get his son a job in the 
philadelphia district attorneys office the son still works for 
the prosecutor 
biddle testified his stories were fair truthful and accurate 
and insisted that what he wrote concerned the official actions not 
only of mcdermott but of all justices 
only mcdermott sued 
the code of judicial conduct which i researched and used in 
my story says in pennsylvania a judge should not participate where 
his partiality might reasonably be questioned biddle testified 
to act against that code is to engage in misconduct 
while mcdermott acknowledged that the reported facts were 
substantially true he insisted the inferences and innuendos they 
raised and the way paragraphs were positioned in the paper left 
the impression he was dishonest 
he had demanded a retraction before he sued 
all i wanted was for them to say that i was an honest man and 
not corrupt he testified if they had done it we wouldnt 
have to spend all this time and all this money and be in this 
courtroom 
the justice said that never ever did he have financial 
ties receive any personal gifts or have any conflicts of interest 
with anyone involved in cases before the supreme court

world trade negotiations collapsed 
friday when the united states and the european community refused to 
back down and end a bitter dispute over reductions in farm 
subsidies 
they must both have glass eyes because no one blinked 
canadas trade minister john crosbie said after bargaining was 
suspended in the 107nation negotiations the most comprehensive 
trade talks ever 
uruguays foreign minister hector gros espiell halted five 
days of discussions after the ec rejected a compromise requiring 
deeper cuts in its extensive farm support program 
gros espiell promised to restart the talks possibly next month 
in geneva after further consultations to try to resolve the 
contentious farm issue 
but no one seemed in a hurry to get together again 
when it is clear that a basis exists for successfully 
concluding the round the united states will return to the 
negotiating table said us trade representative carla hills 
we need this coolingoff period to get a full evaluation of 
the situation said indias commerce minister subramanian swamy 
president bush who was in caracas venezuela said late friday 
the united states remains committed to completing the trade 
talks 
accordingly it is our hope that participants especially the 
ec will take this opportunity to reflect upon their position on 
agriculture and develop the political will to negotiate real 
marketopening agreements while there is still time to do so 
said bush 
the suspension occurred in what was supposed to be the final 
week of bargaining in the uruguay round the negotiations begun in 
1986 in the south american country 
the talks were designed to overhaul the world trading system by 
rewriting the rules and lowering barriers to trade in 15 areas 
including textiles agriculture manufactured goods and services 
such as banking telecommunications and construction 
success officials have said will give an enormous boost to the 
world economy well into the 21st century 
the agriculture fight attracted the most attention during the 
bargaining because the united states and others have insisted they 
wont budge on other areas without a deal on farm subsidies 
the united states backed by australia argentina uruguay and 
others insisted the community slash such assistance by 75 percent 
to 90 percent with the deepest cuts in export subsidies 
the ec refused contending that hefty slashes would force some 
of its 10 million farmers off the land its original offer called 
only for a 30 percent cut in limited areas 
each side blamed the other for the failure 
the community said the united states put too much attention on 
agriculture and was unwilling to negotiate in all other areas under 
consideration 
we were prepared to continue negotiations we didnt walk 
out of the room said frans andriessen the communitys top trade 
official 
unless and until they the americans reduce their 
expectations there will not be progress on agriculture said 
ray macsharry the communitys hardline agriculture chief 
mrs hills and clayton yeutter the american agriculture 
secretary said it was up to the europeans 
the question is whether the community is out of step or 
whether the rest of the world is out of step yeutter told a news 
conference 
the collapse was disappointing to developing nations which 
would like to use the talks to pry open more markets in the rich 
countries for their products 
mexican trade secretary jaime serra who presided over the 
negotiations on services predicted a deal could have been struck 
had the officials won agreement on agriculture 
the negotations are sponsored by the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade which was set up in 1947 as a forum and an 
agreement for promoting freer world trade

one of big oils persistent critics sen howard 
m metzenbaum lashed out at high gasoline prices friday demanding 
an explanation from a dozen major oil companies 
leaders of the oil industry in the united states owe the 
american people an answer if not a refund or a discount the 
ohio democrat said in a letter sent to exxon corp chairman 
lawrence g rawl and the heads of 11 other oil giants they 
cannot understand this situation and neither can we in congress 
metzenbaum said that if oil companies do not start cutting 
gasoline prices immediately he will look into the possibility of 
holding congressional hearings into their pricing policies 
metzenbaum said he was outraged to see that gasoline prices have 
stayed at high levels in recent weeks even though crude oil prices 
have come down about 15 per barrel from the highs they hit during 
october 
this week the futures price of unleaded gasoline fell to within 
a penny of the price it commanded the day before iraq invaded 
kuwait yet the american automobile association reported that 
gasoline prices at the pump were within a penny of the highest 
price it has ever recorded 
why is it that gasoline prices go up instantly when crude oil 
costs go up but when crude oil costs come down your gasoline 
prices do not metzenbaum asked the oil executives 
the major oil companies say they do not control pricing which 
is set by local service stations and eventually finds its 
appropriate levels through supply and demand 
exxon spokesman bill smith in dallas said he had no immediate 
response to the letter metzenbaum sent to rawl 
metzenbaum said in a telephone interview friday evening that he 
does not have high hopes for getting any kind of answer from the 
oil companies that he would consider satisfactory 
of all the industries in america there are probably few 
maybe with the exception of the tobacco industry that has less a 
sense of community responsbility than the oil industry the 
senator said 
the industry for its part has characterized metzenbaum as a 
demagogue 
the senators letters also went out to shell oil co mobil 
corp bp america inc texaco inc chevron corp amoco corp 
marathon oil co atlantic richfield co phillips petroleum co 
unocal corp and sun co

spokesman said friday 
sac and fox industries was to have delivered 245515 suits by

kuwait four months ago the suits would be used to guard us 
troops against chemical warfare 
johnson also said some suits did not meet government standards 
bruce willingham a company director attributed part of the 
problem to the rising cost of raw materials which increased 
following the invasion 
prices soared for raw materials and so did the material 
suppliers who changed the way they operated their credit he 
said friday

reimburse them for the suits until they pass inspection creating

ncr corp chairman charles exley jr said 
friday his company has no plans to sell itself to atampt despite the 
fact his board of directors set a minimum price 
exley said his board set the 125pershare minimum because it 
felt obligated to its shareholders to set a fullvalue price 
he said ncr would fight any takeover by atampt if that price isnt 
met 
in the name of rationality and in recognition of its fiduciary 
responsibility to ncr shareholders the board felt obligated to set 
a full value price for shares he said in a statement it 
would be preposterous for us to say there is no price we would 
accept 
however exley repeated his vow to keep ncr independent 
the fact that the board set a price does not mean that we want 
to sell the company the company is not for sale he said 
american telephone amp telegraph co launced a 90ashare cash 
tender offer to ncr shareholders thursday on wednesday ncrs 
board rejected a takeover bid of 90 a share in atampt stock or a 
total of about 61 billion 
ncr directors said wednesday in their rejection that they would 
enter into discussions with atampt over a merger if it increased the 
bid to 125 a share or a total of about 85 billion atampt 
rejected the amount as outrageous 
exley said ncr would provide atampt with nonpublic information 
about his companys finances that would justify the higher offer if 
atampt would sign a confidentiality agreement and an agreement to 
halt further steps toward a takeover 
also friday atampt said it would withdraw a request it filed in 
us district court in columbus seeking a temporary restraining 
order against enforcement of the ohio takeover act 
the law sets out procedures to be followed and information 
disclosed in tender offers 
thomas b ridgley a columbus lawyer representing atampt told 
judge james l graham the company would drop its motion as a result 
of an order issued by the ohio division of securities 
the order confirmed that the agency based on documents provided 
by atampt would not suspend the companys bid for shares of ncr 
atampts request for a restraining order was part of a lawsuit 
filed thursday contending federal instead of state law should 
prevail in its bid for ncr although the request for expedited 
action was dropped the suit is pending
