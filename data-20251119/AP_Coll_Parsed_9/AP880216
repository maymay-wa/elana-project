an arsonist who burned the towns elementary 
school and damaged a church that opened its doors to students may 
have set a fire monday that destroyed another church and its 
classrooms authorities said 
omak a central washington town of 4000 that boasts okanogan 
countys only stoplight has been terrorized by the arson spree 
its affected everyone in town people are very very grim 
said mary koch managing editor of the weekly omak chronicle 
they were somber as they drove by it going to work this morning 
it was still burning 
the north omak elementary school was heavily damaged in a 
january fire its second in two months in the past two weeks two 
churches and a church parsonage have been set afire 
theyre a kook someone who is unbalanced said vic 
power superintendent of omaks school district 
school officials have checked through their records for any 
former employee or student who has a grudge but have turned up 
nothing he said 
one of the interesting things in omak is we havent had any 
particular problems with people havent had anyone out there we 
could identify who had been on our case for any particular 
reason power said 
police chief peter sirois said police are looking at two or 
three persons of interest at this point police have 
interviewed about a dozen people so far he said he declined to 
say why the persons of interest might have wanted to harm the 
schools or churches 
firefighters on monday extinguished the latest fire which 
destroyed the 15 million omak presbyterian church the church and 
the free methodist church had served as temporary classrooms after 
the fire at the elementary school which served students in 
kindergarten though second grade 
last week the methodist church sustained about 200000 in 
damage a fire set there saturday and at the parsonage next door on 
sunday caused an additional 30000 in damage said mike cramer 
assistant chief of the eightperson omak police force 
its got everybody on the edge said pastor elbert g 
harlow who lives across the street from his presbyterian church 
theyre nervous waiting to see whats going to happen next 
church officials met sunday night and made sure all doors and 
windows were locked harlow said a security guard woke him monday 
with news of the fire 
the blzae apparently was set by someone who broke into the 
basement through a window hidden by two evergreen trees beside the 
threestory redbrick church omak fire chief cal bowling said 
but bowling said hed rather not discuss the investigation with 
reporters 
whoever set these fires is going to read your report and id 
just hate to let him know what this has done to the community 
bowling said 
the latest fire was too hot monday for the fire marshal to 
determine what caused it cramer said 
we have a strong feeling but we cant draw any conclusions 
yet he said authorities hope to determine the cause by tuesday 
but there was no doubt that an arsonist had set the earlier 
fires cramer said 
the fires are beginning to take a psychological toll on 
residents and on the 1800 students including 450 from north omak 
elementary cramer said 
its having a bad effect on everybody when the first fire hit 
the school it devastated the kids it was tough for them to move 
now theyre going to have to again he said 
electricians and plumbers helped set up temporary buildings as 
classrooms said cramer who added that nighttime patrols have been 
expanded with the help of the okanogan sheriffs department 
it only seems to happen while omak sleeps cramer said in 
a way thats good because the buildings are empty and so far no 
one has been hurt 
the rev norman lund pastor of foursquare gospel church which 
also housed north elementary students said he doesnt want to 
guess what the arsonist is thinking 
i think everyones concerned about saying anything he said 
you dont want to motivate the person

the official celebration of the us 
constitutions 200th birthday was largely ceremonial but 
historians say the true tribute actually came during the 
congressional hearings into the irancontra affair and the supreme 
court nomination of robert bork 
the commission on the bicentennial of the us constitution the 
official sponsor of the tribute to the 200yearold document got 
some credit from historians for reaching out to the people with 
such things as its pocketsize copies of the constitution but 
others faulted it for paying too little attention to serious 
scholarship 
most of the historians interviewed in recent weeks about the 
bicentennial celebration agreed that americans learned more about 
the constitution and its workings through watching the irancontra 
hearings on television and reading about the debate on the bork 
nomination than through any planned activity 
my sense is that the commissions work was not particularly 
substantive said laurence tribe a constitutional law professor 
at harvard university who testified to the senate judiciary 
committee against the bork nomination nonetheless what the 
country experienced proved to be extraordinarily profound because 
of the irancontra hearings and the bork hearings 
you cant help observing how much the public became involved 
in discussions on the meaning of the constitution the role the 
courts should play the fundamental relationships between the 
executive and legislative branches tribe said those topics 
usually are discussed just by lawyers 
g edward white professor of law and history at the university 
of virginia agreed that the bicentennial commissions efforts 
were largely ceremonial 
the ones that have come to my attention basically are on a 
kind of superficial ceremonial level he said 
in comparison he said the bork hearings were one of the 
major contributors unconsciously so to the constitutional 
debate 
j woodford howard jr a political science professor at johns 
hopkins university recalled that when he went to parties last 
summer and fall all that people wanted to talk about were the bork 
or irancontra hearings 
this was the constitution in action howard said both 
hearings really drove home the fact that the constitution is not 
just a document or a fossil but something that is enduring 
former chief justice warren burger who gave up his place on the 
court to devote full time to heading the bicentennial commission 
said he believes its work did have an impact on americans 
understanding of the document that guarantees their freedoms 
my guess will be theres a higher awareness a higher 
consciousness not necessarily of the details he said in a 
recent interview in his office if a free people dont look from 
time to time at their liberties and how they got them they take 
the risk of losing them 
although we succeeded in creating greater awareness that 
doesnt mean detailed knowledge necessarily burger added 
a coffee table in burgers office in the supreme court building 
was covered with recently published books and pamphlets on the 
constitution on it too was a cereal box with a short historical 
message copies of placemats from fastfood restaurants with short 
constitutional quizzes and a bicentennial calendar 
louis harlan a history professor at the university of maryland 
and presidentelect of the american historical association was one 
of the historians critical of the commissions work 
the parades and fireworks have faded into history he said 
but the commission has failed to give us something that will 
endure and be of use to future generations 
burger countered that the commissions work will lead to a wider 
audience for scholarly works and noted that other government 
agencies have financed studies on the constitution 
the commission stated at the start of its work that it wanted to 
teach americans more about the constitution it cited a survey that 
found that about half of the public could not identify the purpose 
of the constitution or explain what the bill of rights is 
burger said no survey of americans knowledge of the document 
has been taken in the wake of last years tribute which reached a 
zenith last sept 16 with a party on the capitol steps in 
washington and with a ceremony in philadelphia the next day 
henry steele commager a historian at amherst college said he 
did not believe it was possible to measure the success of the 
bicentennial activities 
what is the criterion for success for a party he asked 
if you want to know if people learned anything who knows 
obviously the lessons of watergate didnt teach mr reagan 
anything about the constitution 
howard said the mood of the country for the constitutions 
bicentennial was one of introspection we were worrying about 
whether we have dropped the torch and i think the irancontra 
hearings and bork hearings really brought that feeling home 
this time we had the constitution in action howard added 
those hearings brought the constitution to life

the house resumes its struggle toward a 
national aids policy this week with two sharply contrasting 
californians at the extremes of disputes over issues ranging from 
discrimination to testing 
on one side is democratic rep henry waxman the liberal and 
influential chairman of the house health subcommittee whose los 
angeles district is ethnically diverse and bigcity tolerant 
across the ideological gulf but geographically next door is rep 
william dannemeyer rcalif a conservative from straightlaced 
and suburban orange county 
their differences will be aired friday at what waxman is calling 
a refresher hearing on his bill to provide money for voluntary 
aids tests guarantee confidentiality for those tested and protect 
aids victims and carriers from discrimination 
the hearing follows a series of canceled work sessions last year 
that dannemeyer claims were scratched because waxman didnt have 
enough votes to win approval of his bill 
if he cant achieve his objective of antidiscrimination 
status for those with the virus he will not move a bill in the 
100th congress dannemeyer said 
we had other things pressing on us waxman responded when 
asked why the sessions were canceled he said he expects to finish 
work on the aids bill within two months 
though he maintained he is always open to discussion waxman 
indicated he would not compromise on the measures confidentiality 
or civil rights provisions and said he detected little support for 
dannemeyers positions 
the whole public health world has concluded we need to protect 
against discrimination waxman said the only people likely to 
come in for tests if there is no protection are people at low 
risk of having aids 
dannemeyer calls it inappropriate and absurd to legislate 
antidiscrimination safeguards because of what he contends is the 
unstable status of information about aids transmission 
while waxman quotes the prevailing view of virtually all public 
health authorities that aids cannot be transmitted by casual 
contact dannemeyer asserts that those authorities are rethinking 
their dogmatic pronouncements that the aids virus is not a threat 
in the workplace 
dannemeyer says employers should be free to decide whether to 
fire an aids victim or carrier 
the civil rights of the uninfected are entitled to just as 
much protection as the infected dannemeyer said he also 
asserted that protecting aids victims from discrimination conflicts 
with the heterosexual ethic 
going against the grain of prevailing psychiatric thought he 
contended that homosexuals voluntarily choose their sexual 
preference and said schoolchildren should be taught that 
homosexuality is a perverse lifestyle its an unhealthy 
lifestyle thats a fact we should tell that to kids 
dannemeyer has introduced a bill requiring aids testing of 
marriage license applicants hospital patients people being 
treated for venereal disease and people convicted of drug or sex 
crimes he has also sponsored a bill that requires reporting by 
name of every individual who has aids or tests positive for 
antibodies to the aids virus 
waxman said dannemeyer and others who promote such reporting 
requirements seem to want these names for some other purpose 
and that suspicion would discourage highrisk individuals from 
being tested 
we have a clear danger of hysterical overreaction where many 
people might find themselves persecuted for being infected 
waxman said we cant get sidetracked into an antigay crusade 
when our real job is to stop the spread of this terrible disease 
waxman said the biggest concern at this point is not the 
transmission of aids among homosexuals but its spread among 
intravenous drug users and their sexual contacts in the 
underclass 
dannemeyer contended that strong homosexual lobbies are hobbling 
congress and some state legislatures in their handling of the 
disease he said aids victims have received kidglove treatment 
that flies in the face of traditional ways to halt epidemics 
if 73 percent of the aids cases were presented by people 
with gray eyes a highly disorganized group in america three years 
ago we would have witnessed largescale quarantine of anyone who 
had the virus he said 
dannemeyer also condemned an educational film created by the gay 
mens health crisis in new york city he distributed videotaped 
copies to reporters and said the film uses tax dollars to promote 
homosexuality 
the tape features blunt language a demonstration of condom use 
on a cucumber and a scene of two men kissing in a shower 
waxman said he had not seen the tape but added i wouldnt 
know how to design a message to the gay community i dont think 
mr dannemeyer would know how to design it but wed better 
start getting the message across and not pull our punches because 
were fearful of talking about sex

the odds are increasing rapidly that americans 
traveling abroad can find a fastfood place that bears a familiar 
name 
mcdonalds in munich pizza hut in fiji and taco bell in 
sydney are just three examples of the trend toward expanding 
foreign markets for us restaurant fanchises says an 
agriculture department report 
in 1985 there were 6122 international franchise units up 36 
percent from 3943 in 1980 figures by the commerce department show 
that canada and japan account for almost half with australia and 
new zealand ranking next 
the report was written for the departments national food review 
magazine by two economists charlene price and hal linstrom of 
usdas economic research service 
as you might expect the popularity of the different 
restaurants varied around the world the report said for 
example canada was the largest market for hamburger units and 
japan accounted for the greatest share of the chicken market 
austalians and new zealanders enjoyed pizza 
mcdonalds kentucky fried chicken burger king and wendys the 
four largest us restaurant chains accounted for 31 percent of 
the world total franchising 4626 restaurants internationally by 
1986 up from 272 in 1974 the report said 
as the largest food service organization in the world with about 
9400 establishments mcdonalds led the international scene with 
about 2138 outlets compared with 370 five years earlier the 
report said 
kentucky fried chicken a division of pepsico inc operated 
more than 6500 units including 1854 in 54 foreign countries 
burger king part of pillsbury foodservice operated 4744 
outlets in 1986 including 403 in 24 foreign countries and puerto 
rico 
wendys which grew to the worlds fourthlargest restaurant 
chain in 17 years operated almost 4000 outlets including 231 in 
17 foreign countries 
of the four largest franchisers only kentucky fried chicken 
operated outlets in africa in 1986 and also held sole position in 
the middle eastern countries the report said 
franchise growth overseas will continue in existing markets 
the report said at the same time some chains are entering 
previously untapped areas kentucky fried chicken and pizza hut 
for instance recently negotiated with the chinese and russian 
governments to bring fast food to those countries 
most franchise restaurant companies probably will keep expanding 
their menus and services abroad as well as in the united states 
particularly to meet a growing interest in diet and light foods 
strong growth in mexican and oriental foods may also mean 
introduction of new menu items the report said following the 
us trend breakfast offerings are also likely to increase in 
overseas restaurants

a shot or two of carbon dioxide the stuff 
used in some fire extinguishers may be just the thing to help 
sensitive plants such as raspberries and blueberries survive the 
stress of heat therapy says an agriculture department plant 
pathologist 
the result one day could be a new assortment of plants for 
nurseries and home gardeners 
heat is used in special chambers to rid fruit and vegetable 
plants of viruses at 100 degrees fahrenheit the heat forces the 
plants to grow faster than the viruses lurking in them said 
richard h converse who works for the departments agricultural 
research service corvallis ore 
but thats too hot for blueberries and many raspberries he said 
in a recent report by the agency if carbon dioxide is raised to 
1100 parts per million in the chamber from the 350 parts normally 
present in the air the plants are able to withstand the heat 
converse said the process of raising carbon dioxide levels had 
been used previously by australian scientists to heattreat grape 
plants he is hopeful that the procedure can be used to eliminate 
viruses from apples oranges potatoes onions and bulb crops such 
as iris and lilies

poultry processors soon will be allowed more 
options in repackaging and relabeling federally inspected fowl and 
poultry products for final distribution to consumer outlets says 
the agriculture department 
as it is right now poultry products can only be repacked and 
relabeled at federally inspected plants 
warehouses and distribution centers are often more 
conveniently located than federally inspected plants said lester 
m crawford administrator of the departments food safety and 
inspection service so allowing certain facilities to repackage 
and relabel poultry products with inspectors present means savings 
in time and money and a safe product we believe the savings in 
transportation costs could ultimately mean lower prices for 
consumers 
the optional operations will also have to be done under the 
supervision of federal inspectors he said the new rule will take 
effect on march 11 
the processors will pay usda for the inspection at the 
repackaging operations crawford said the optional service has been 
available to the meat industry but has not been allowed under 
poultry inspection regulations 
repacking and relabeling allow bulk shipments of federally 
inspected products to be divided into consumer packages and to have 
brand names placed on the products

rep barney frank who acknowledged last year 
that he is a homosexual is busy raising money for his reelection 
campaign while the republican party is still looking for someone to 
oppose him 
at this point the only republican publicly talking of running 
against the liberal massachusetts democrat is a conservative gadfly 
who withdrew from the 1986 massachusetts gubernatorial race after 
admitting he had lied about his military record 
i dont know what the republicans plan to do about it but the 
reading we have from polling is that voters care about 
performance in office and not personal issues like sexual 
preference frank said and thats certainly consistent with the 
reading ive gotten from people 
massachusetts democrats say the homosexual disclosure will have 
little impact on voters who have sent frank to congress with 
increasingly convincing victory margins 52 percent 60 percent 
74 percent and 89 percent 
and they note that the disclosure was not news to many 
constituents 
republicans however are talking about how frank could be 
defeated in the states 4th district which includes democratic 
strongholds on the outskirts of boston upperclass republican 
enclaves like wellesley and mill towns like fall river near the 
rhode island border 
joe malone executive director of the state gop said the 
homosexual issue could be exploited by a republican challenger not 
by attacking franks sexual preference but by telling voters he is 
focusing too heavily on gay issues at the expense of other 
congressional work 
ive always thought its a case of how the congressman votes 
and if his sexuality slants his voting in such a way that he no 
longer represents his district malone said 
in many cases he has chosen to pursue issues that have an 
effect on the gay community to the detriment of issues that affect 
the typical constituent in his district he added 
however malone could not immediately provide any examples and 
franks supporters point to his work on several major bills in 1987 
to counter that argument 
they credit him with playing major roles in passage of a measure 
requiring that any lowincome federal housing demolished under 
urban renewal be replaced a bill requiring a special prosecutor be 
appointed to investigate alleged wrongdoing by administration 
figures and legislation prohibiting the government from denying 
visas based on politics 
while republicans talk about franks vulnerability there is no 
declared candidate with the election nine months away the only 
politician publicly considering a challenge to frank is royall 
switzler who would carry considerable political baggage into any 
race 
switzler made a name for himself by taking on leaders of the 
democraticcontrolled massachusetts house often alone during 
his years in the state legislature 
the massachusetts gop enlisted switzler in 1986 to run against 
popular democratic gov michael dukakis but he was forced to bow 
out after admitting he was a sergeant in peacetime korea not a 
green beret captain in vietnam 
frank 47 is taking nothing for granted 
campaign reports filed with the federal election commission show 
that his spending and fundraising in 1987 were more than double 
his campaign receipts and expenditures during 1985 the last 
nonelection year 
the fourthterm congressman raised 144300 during 1987

planners of the ronald reagan 
presidential library forced to abandon a site at stanford 
university after widespread protests are running into skepticism 
from some city officials about their proposal to build the library 
near this southern california city 
the 100acre site donated by the real estate development firm 
of blakeleyswartz impinges on a greenbelt area that is protected 
from largescale development by a decadeold nonbinding agreement 
among simi valley moorpark and thousand oaks 
we do not want the library project used as means for further 
landuse concessions on any property within the greenbelt 
moorpark officials wrote on jan 7 to the ventura county board of 
supervisors which must approve the project moorpark mayor john 
galloway said similar letters were sent by officials of thousand 
oaks and simi valley 
donald e swartz a partner in the developing firm said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles we have seen the letter and 
i think we can live within the scope of that 
but moorpark city councilman clint harper a mathematics teacher 
at moorpark college said we are concerned as a council that the 
reagan library may be used as a lever to get additional land 
development 
however he added that he thinks the 60 million library could 
be consistent with the greenbelt if that is the only anticipated 
use 
galloway expressed surprise at a report in the los angeles times 
on sunday that blakeleyswartz plans to build a 300room hotel and 
conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library site we 
are going to have real concerns about that the moorpark mayor 
said 
swartz said only about 40 acres of the blakeleyswartz property 
lie within the greenbelt nevertheless previous efforts to develop 
the property have been rebuffed by local officials who argued such 
development would affect the integrity of the greenbelt agreement 
the strongest concerns have been expressed by moorpark which 
officials say would be most affected by development of the property 
because of its location 
i think in general people are very supportive of the 
librarysaid simi valley mayor greg stratton one of the 
reasons the reagans liked the area was that it was so unspoiled so 
development would be contradictory to the presidents wishes to a 
certain extent that will help maintain it as a greenbelt 
the greenbelt covering about 1200 acres embraces an area of 
rolling hills covered with brush beavertail cactus and 
wildflowers the heights command a sweeping view of surrounding 
valleys and on a clear day californias offshore channel islands 
can be seen in the distance 
although surrounded by more development the site is in itself 
much like the country around the reagans ranch about 80 miles 
northwest of simi valley where the president and first lady nancy 
reagan are taking a brief vacation 
selection of the site climaxed a search which began after the 
ronald reagan presidential foundation abandoned the stanford 
location in the face of opposition from students faculty and 
homeowners reasons for the opposition ranged from politics to 
traffic 
mrs reagan was driven to the new site during a california 
vacation in august and approved it the president gave his approval 
after flying over planners said 
the foundation has not yet filed a plan with ventura county 
officials for development of the site but has said it hopes to 
start construction in july local officials say they will be 
concerned if roads and other facilities for the library would 
support additional development 
this is the first time that we have had the prospect of quite 
such a prestigious proposal said simi valley city council member 
ann rock this isnt something that comes along every day so im 
assuming that the reagan foundation indeed is serious 
now what i dont know if they have a fairly intense landuse 
plan is whether or not they are going to get the goahead from 
ventura county that may be discouraging

pat robertson had just finished a strident 
anticommunist sermon to the chamber of commerce when kent evans 
stood up and told the republican candidate what was on his mind 
im shaking he said im sitting here really afraid when 
you start talk about going to war 
it was a dramatic moment on the eve of the crucial new hampshire 
primary where robertson hoped for another surprising finish in the 
wake of his upstart secondplace showing in iowa 
after several minutes of backandforth robertson told evans 
i dont know what else to say except that peace will come through 
strength maybe would you prefer to live under communism i 
dont know id rather be free 
the confrontation with the portsmouth merchant highlighted the 
strong reaction some have to robertsons foreign policy positions 
it also came as the gop hopeful was embroiled in a controversy 
about soviet missiles and cuba robertson said during a sunday 
night debate that soviet mediumrange missiles are still based on 
the island although he backed off the assertion monday saying he 
had no such firsthand knowledge 
robertson drew criticism from his opponents for the comment in 
tones that echoed evans fears 
this is a very serious allegation bush said in an interview 
on a manchester nh radio station you keep hearing these 
outrageous charges which are designed to scare the american 
people 
rep jack kemp of new york called it a rather rash and 
unsupportable charge 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said ss4 and ss5 
missile sites established in cuba in 1962 were confirmed as 
having been destroyed in that year 
at the chamber of commerce candidate forum robertson gave his 
standard speech with a strong defense of america and strong 
denunciations of communism as the greatest evil the nation faces 
after hearing what robertson had to say this was evans 
reaction he advocates using weapons and war as a solution to all 
the problems in the world thats isnt a solution thats 
annihilation 
robertson talked of the berlin wall calling it an abomination 
that the united state should have stopped 
had i been president when that was done there would have been 
us tanks on the move to knock that thing down robertson said 
and that was too much for evans who runs an office furniture 
store 
im sitting here really afraid when you start talk about going 
to war the way you just talked about it the result of taking tanks 
to the berlin wall said evans with all that talk of war not 
understanding the threat we face today from nuclear weapons we 
can no longer do it 
part of the audience of 250 applauded evans robertson asked who 
he supports and evans said senate gop leader bob dole 
robertson nodded and went on to compare the current situation to 
the challenge posed by adolf hitlers germany in the 1930s 
had we been resolute in the face of dictatorship that would 
never have happened i am for peace with all of my heart 
robertson said 
evans broke in there were not nuclear weapons when hitler was 
there you need to address the root cause before it comes up to a 
hitler not afterward with weapons 
the former television evangelist was clearly irritated by evans 
questions but pressed on 
you have somebody who is every bit as bad as hitler in charge 
of many nations of the world robertson said communism is just 
as bad as the nazis if we want to have peace in our world it 
is absolutely essential that we stand up resolutely to communism 
several times later during the appearance robertson returned to 
evans to address his concerns 
at one point he said this gentleman had all the concerns 
sir i want to eliminate nuclear weapons from the face of the 
earth

pat robertson says he has no firsthand 
evidence that there are soviet missiles in cuba as he had claimed 
in a debate over the weekend with his republican presidential 
rivals 
robertson came under fire monday for the assertion made sunday 
which fellow gop candidates termed rash and outrageous 
the white house emphatically denied the claim and the man 
identified by the robertson campaign as the candidates source said 
the existence of such weapons in cuba has not been confirmed 
the former television evangelist initially said monday that he 
would not back off his claim but later in the day he began 
revising it until he was saying that he had been asking a question 
not making an assertion when he alleged that cuba has nuclear 
weapons pointed at the united states 
i was asking in the debate is this true he said i have 
no sources other than what ive said so there was no categorial 
statement per se 
in the debate robertson was attacking the intermediaterange 
missile treaty signed last december by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev when he made the claim 
somehow in all this brilliant negotiations which these 
gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty he 
said and it seems to me nukes pointing at the united states are 
more vital to our security than nukes pointing to europe 
pressed by reporters here robertson said he had no firsthand 
evidence that there are such weapons in cuba 
my contention is there might be missiles in the caves they 
may have brought in missiles on some other transport vessel or 
possibly a submarine i dont know the exact sizing of it but 
nobody can say for certain that those missiles arent there he 
said 
later interviewed on cable news networks larry king live 
robertson said it is possible there are soviet missiles in cuba 
i dont think frankly theres anybody in the united states 
right now that im aware of who can say categorically that there 
are or theyre not there he said 
earlier monday robertson had told a gop candidates forum here 
that the least we can do in this is get those nuclear weapons out 
of cuba a reiteration of the statements he had made during 
sundays debate in goffstown nh 
im not going to back off from that id be happy to have 
somebody prove me wrong he told an interviewer 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said ss4 and ss5 
missile sites established in cuba in 1962 were confirmed as 
having been destroyed in that year we also are confident that the 
missiles were removed from cuba at that time 
we have had extensive intelligence collection directed at cuba 
since 1962 and have no evidence that ss4 ss5 or other strategic 
missiles have been deployed there fitzwater said 
asked whether he was denying any offensive nuclear weapons are 
deployed in cuba fitzwater said exactly 
vice president george bush said in an interview monday that 
im confident this robertson assertion is not true and 
added you keep hearing these outrageous charges which are 
designed to scare the american people 
another gop presidential candidate rep jack kemp of new york 
called it a rather rash and unsupportable charge 
officials with robertsons campaign said his contention was 
based on information supplied by david s sullivan a staff member 
of the republican minority on the democraticcontrolled senate 
foreign relations committee 
but sullivan said monday in an interview with the associated 
press that we do not know whether nuclear weapons are in cuba or 
not

supporters of george bush are 
claiming an overwhelming victory in a republican straw poll but 
bob doles backers boycotted the vote and say theyll win when it 
counts on primary election day 
bush garnered 731 votes while dole got 32 in the presidential 
straw poll which bush supporters denounced as illegal 
this proves that puerto rico is george bush country said 
josito dapena bushs campaign director for puerto rico 
dole supporters minimized the importance of the poll which is 
not binding saying the real test is march 20 when puerto rico 
holds its primary 
we dont participate in straw polls said donald devine a 
prodole observer at the assembly 
there was a bitter dispute when gop national committeeman edison 
misla aldarondo a dole backer tried to address the gathering to 
question whether there was a quorum he was told he had not 
registered as a delegate and could not speak 
luis a ferre the local gop chairman said the presence of 750 
of the 1500 delegates in the general assembly would constitute a 
quorum dole supporters said there were only 682 delegates 
registered but the bush forces said more than 900 attended 
the dole campaign in washington issued a statement saying bush 
backers had failed in an attempt to convene and illegally 
poll puerto rico republicans 
mondays assembly was originally scheduled to chose the 14 
delegates to the republican convention instead of waiting for march 
20 however the local democratic party went to court to prevent 
the primary from being advanced 
bushs national campaign manager lee atwater said the puerto 
rico results would give the vice president a lift going into the 
new hampshire primary and also send a positive signal to other 
hispanic voters throughout the united states

last week the political spotlight was on a 
farm state whose economy has fared poorly during the reagan years 
now it turns to a new england state that has been booming 
political analysts say economic circumstances may have a bigger 
impact on the new hampshire primary than any momentum from the feb 
8 caucuses in iowa where democrat richard gephardt and republican 
bob dole came in first with vice president george bush falling 
back to third place behind pat robertson on the gop side 
iowa was a state that voted for change says william 
schneider a fellow at the american enterprise institute the 
status quo candidates were bush and dukakis and they both did 
fairly or very poorly 
the reagan legacy and the massachusetts miracle didnt sell in 
iowa schneider said but new hampshire is at the other 
extreme with the lowest unemployment rate in the country and a 
boom economy the status quo is much more popular 
schneider said exit polling in iowa by the los angeles times 
showed the more dissatisfied you were with the way things were 
going the more you voted for dole or robertson on the republican 
side if you were realy unhappy you voted for robertson and for 
gephardt on the democratic side 
kevin phillips a republican analyst agreed that iowa was a 
considerable portrait of discontent 
bushs screaming onefifth of the vote was the only vote that 
you could really read as support of the president thats pretty 
low for an incumbent vice president said phillips 
on the democratic side its pretty clear that gephardt and 
simon and jackson did better than early expectations the guy who 
ran a little bit behind early expectations was mr new england good 
news the man with the purring economy whose message is for the 
yuppies dukakis said phillips 
in new hampshire what dukakis has to worry about is falling 
short of expectations like muskie in 1972 he added 
stu eizenstat a top policy adviser in the carter 
administration predicted that the combined iowa and new hampshire 
results may only show the strength of regional candidates 
midwesterners gephardt and simon in the midwest new englander 
dukakis in new england 
if al gore and jesse jackson the two democrats with the 
strongest southern ties emerge as the big winners on super 
tuesday then the democrats may be left with no one candidate 
showing a national base and strength 
well have sorted out regional candidates with no base 
anywhere eizenstat said

the roof of the washington public power 
supply system no 2 nuclear reactor building cracked because of a 
malfunctioning fan but the mishap posed no danger officials said 
monday night 
during a safety check of a circuit breaker sunday night an air 
supply fan came on inadvertently and within a few minutes had built 
enough pressure to pop about 200 bolts that fasten an interlocking 
grid of steel panels in the roof of the building said lee oxsen 
operations director the bolts are about a quarterinch in diameter 
and an inch long he said 
no loud noise accompanied the fracture and it was discovered 
only as a reactor operator noticed the bolts on the floor while 
making a routine hourly inspection less than an hour later oxsen 
said 
the pressure pushed the roof upward a few inches and when it 
fell back into place there were two seams in a rough tshape one 
seam about 40 feet long and the other about 25 feet long said 
barbara mathews of wppss 
the nuclear regulatory commission was notified immediately but 
there was no danger to workers or the public ms mathews said the 
plant was shut down at the time 
oxsen said repairs could cost more than 1 million a couple 
of hundred thousand dollars a day for up to a week 
these roof panels i should add are designed to do exactly 
what they did he said these bolts are designed to pop when 
internal pressure reaches a specified level 
he explained that the pressure system and roof design are 
intended to protect the reactor from inward collapse in the event 
of a tornado or other severe storm 
he said an initial inspection indicated the only repairs needed 
would be to bolt the panels back into place and restore the foam 
tar and gravel on top of the roof which is about 120 feet off the 
ground 
the whole building is pressurized he said 
oxsen said similar accidents had occurred at other reactors 
including the oyster creek plant in new jersey about 19 or 20 years 
ago he said he did not know the cost of repairs in that or other 
instances 
the plant at the nearby hanford nuclear reservation was shut 
down saturday to fix leaks in two condenser tubes in the cooling 
system so it was an opportune time to do some other 
maintenance oxsen said 
the nrc had directed wppss to check for potential problems in 
some westinghouse circuit breakers including the one linked to the 
errant supply fan he said both exhaust fans and the other supply 
fan were turned off at the time he said 
oxsen said the control panel initially failed to show the supply 
fan had come on and an automatic cutoff system apparently failed 
as well

riot police battled arabs in violent clashes in 
jerusalem and leaflets distributed in the occupied territories 
called on residents to step up protests and attack jewish 
settlements in a day of wrath 
the leaflets which appeared monday also asked arabs to hold 
commercial strikes and stay home from their jobs today israeli 
media said 
in another development the army on monday questioned an arab 
youth who said he and three other residents of the west bank 
village kfar salem were buried alive by israeli soldiers using a 
bulldozer after a riot feb 5 
i am afraid i thought i was going to die said the youth 
abdel latif mahmoud ishtiah 19 i dream about it all the time 
relatives charge that 20 soldiers grabbed the four palestinians 
after the riot beat them forced them to lie on the ground and 
then poured sand over them with a bulldozer the four were 
unconcious when relatives rescued them after several minutes 
according to villagers quoted in israeli newspapers 
two soldiers have been detained in the case and further 
detentions were expected the army said the west banks army 
commander maj gen amram mitzna who ordered the investigation 
said that even in my worst dreams i would never imagine such a 
thing 
defense minister yitzhak rabin on monday attacked leftwing 
legislators who said soldiers had the right to refuse to obey 
orders they considered illegal 
there is nothing more dangerous to israel than soldiers 
deciding what is bad and what is good which orders to accept and 
which orders to reject israel radio quoted rabin as saying 
in interviews with israeli media a number of soldiers have said 
they were troubled by orders to use beatings instead of bullets to 
quell arab protests 
in a related development the hadashot newspaper on monday said 
three soldiers of the elite golani brigade were sentenced to jail 
terms of at least 21 days for using excessive force against 
palestinians 
the army said it had no information on the case 
in jerusalem riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets in 
several locations monday to disperse stonethrowing arabs 
police spokesman rafi levy said police did not use live 
ammunition but a border police officer told photographers that 
forces fired gunshots to subdue protesters in the anata 
neighborhood 
officals at mukassad hospital said they treated a 23yearold 
resident of the citys shufat refugee camp for gunshot wounds to 
the abdomen 
the arabrun palestine press service said the man was shot 
during a clash at shufat it was the first report of bloodshed in 
jerusalem since antiisraeli protests began dec 8 
in jerusalems sur bahir neighborhood border police fired tear 
gas to disperse palestinians who erected roadblocks of twisted 
metal and burning tires residents said border police broke into 
homes 
they showed reporters smashed windows an overturned television 
set and the shattered glass panels of a china cabinet 
israel radio said 21 arabs were arrested in jerusalem on monday 
bringing to 437 the number of demonstrators detained in the holy 
city since dec 8 during that period 54 arabs have been killed by 
israelis in the west bank and gaza strip according to un figures 
in jerusalem members of the gush emunim settlement movement 
said they were printing flyers to be distributed in arab areas the 
leaflets contain threats that if the protests continue arabs might 
be ousted from the west bank israel television said 
in the political arena foreign minister shimon peres on monday 
called on his political rival prime minister yitzhak shamir to 
work out a joint israeli reaction to the new us middle east peace 
initiative 
it doesnt look so good that when american envoys come here 
it appears there are two governments peres told israel 
television 
with the arrival of secretary of state george p shultz 
despite our differences of opinion we need to sit together 
peres said 
shultz is expected to visit the middle east later this month to 
seek support for the us plan 
the proposal calls for an international opening in april to 
launch direct talks on an interim solution for the occupied 
territories negotiations of a final settlement would begin in 
december regardless of the outcome of the interim talks 
peres has accepted the us plan while shamir opposes key 
elements as well as statements by shultz that israel must be ready 
to trade land for peace

midnight voters in the new hampshire 
mountain hamlet of dixville notch gave republican george bush and 
democrat richard gephardt the winning votes in the nations 1988 
leadoff presidential primary 
more often than not dixvilles votes have been a bellwether for 
candidates seeking the presidential nomination 
bush received 11 votes gephardt 4 in the rest of the 
republican field bob dole had 6 jack kemp 5 pete du pont 2 
alexander haig 2 pat robertson 1 
among democrats paul simon received 3 no other democrats 
received votes 
in the primary dixville has a pretty good record in choosing 
the eventual candidates for each party town clerk tom tillotson 
said of past elections its just when we came to november wed 
frequently be in the wrong party 
since 1960 dixville notch voters have sided with the loser in 
all but three presidential elections they picked the winners in 
1972 when they favored richard nixon over george mcgovern and in 
1980 and 1984 when they sided with ronald reagan 
few residents of the resort town in northern new hampshire were 
willing to discuss in advance how they might cast their ballots 
because so many people are asking the voters tend to not be 
committal even amongst themselves said tillotson a supporter 
of vice president george bush 
tillotsons father neil came up with the idea in 1960 of 
making dixville notch the first town in the first primary state to 
cast ballots 
now 89 and the town moderator the elder tillotson who owns 
the balsams resort hotel where the votes are cast and a surgical 
glove factory that is the towns only industry incorporated 
dixville notch that year to push the village into the national 
spotlight 
every four years most of the candidates or their surrogates 
make their way five hours north of boston to dixville notch 
population 47 to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south 
of the quebec border they are followed by more reporters 
photographers and tv camera crews than there are residents in town 
residents take seriously their place in political history they 
make sure to be in their voting booths by 1145 pm so they can 
drop their ballots into the ballot box at the stroke of midnight

vice president george bush forecast a win 
but sen bob dole also expressed optimism monday as the gop 
presidential field sprinted for the finish line in a tight new 
hampshire primary race democrat michael dukakis said his expected 
win might be smaller than predicted 
i sense a rising tide said bush the vice president threw 
all the resources he could muster into his bid to arrest doles 
weeklong surge campaigning side by side and in a hurriedly taped 
television commercial with barry goldwater patron saint of 
conservatives 
it feels good like it did in iowa last monday countered 
dole hoping to ride to victory on the strength of the momentum 
spawned by last weeks caucus win 
one candidate after another posted hopeful predictions of a 
surprise when new hampshire voters render their verdict in the 
nations leadoff primary on tuesday 
i dont know where all those political pundits are today but 
they ran for cover four years ago and theyre likely to run for 
cover tomorrow said former delaware gov pete du pont back in 
the pack in the gop race 
rep jack kemp his gop candidacy on the line held out the hope 
of a secondplace finish that would confound the pollsters im 
going to finish in a good competitive third or higher he said 
democratic sen paul simon also facing tough times if he 
falters said he was sure hed defeat rep richard gephardt for 
second place referring to dukakis commanding lead in the polls 
he said i think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming 
tomorrow 
fellow democrat bruce babbitt far off the pace in the polls 
said im anticipating a strong showing and a surprise but i 
cant put a number on it 
former television evangelist pat robertson bid to deal with a 
tempest that arose over his claim that the soviet union has 
offensive nulcear missiles in cuba the reagan administration 
denied the claim but the gop hopeful said the least we can do 
is remove those nuclear missiles 
democrat dukakis lead seemed secure to judge by the polls but 
he and his aides worried that they would be held to an impossible 
standard when the new hampshire results are analyzed thus he 
noted that his rivals have been attacking him regularly adding 
i assume thats going to take its toll 
no two polls were alike but they all showed a republican race 
as close as the democratic campaign was not 
first results from new hampshire as usual came from the 
mountain hamlet of dixville notch where midnight voters favored 
bush and gephardt who claimed 11 and 4 votes respectively 
in the rest of the republican field dole had 6 kemp 5 du pont 
2 alexander haig 2 robertson 1 the only democrat besides 
gephardt to get any votes was simon who received 3 
dukakis governor in nextdoor massachusetts held a commanding 
lead among the democrats with support of roughly 40 percent of the 
voters gephardt and simon who finished a close onetwo in iowas 
caucuses last week are in a duel for second place jesse jackson 
babbitt gary hart and sen albert gore jr are far afield in the 
polls 
among the republicans the surveys said that dole has wiped out 
all of bushs oncecommanding lead in the eight days since the 
kansas senator won the iowa caucuses and the vice president slipped 
to third place behind pat robertson robertson kemp and former du 
pont are in a close fight for third place in the same surveys 
what the polls couldnt say was whether doles momentum would 
carry him past a struggling bush to first place 
the vice president had his retooled informal campaign style on 
display he went from one restaurant to another to greet voters at 
breakfast time ordering pancakes at one stop sipping coffee at a 
second and eating an egg mcmuffin during a visit to a mcdonalds 
bush attacked doles call for a spending freeze as a copout 
that avoids making tough decisions and forecast a victory for 
himself in the leadoff primary 
im going to win tomorrow believe me he told a cheering 
crowd at daniel webster colleger in nashua 
in the fiveminute television commercial goldwater called bush 
the best qualified candidate of my lifetime other than me 
george addressing the voters bush said who can you most 
trust to continue the reagan revolution 
dole and his senior aides sounded confident i think its that 
close said dole who said a victory in new hampshire might carry 
him all the way to the gop nomination 
im always skeptical until the polls close he said but 
then added that he had followed his pollsters example and slept 
well last night 
william brock doles campaign manager said that no matter what 
the outcome bush was a loser in new hampshire you cant have a 
campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility he 
said 
while bush bid to salvage new hampshire brock already was 
looking beyond 
as for the bush campaigns claim to have a firewall of 
support in southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next 
month brock said its made of straw straw burns pretty fast 
but bushs campaign manager maintained that doles new hampshire 
surge had stalled bush was a little behind but hes moving up 
said lee atwater 
among the democrats simon urged new hampshires voters to 
assert their independence from dukakis there is a difference 
between me and michael dukakis a difference in experience a 
difference in commitment he said 
dukakis had a speech prepared taking aim at gephardt and simon 
but he chose not to deliver it when he faced a high school audience 
in claremont 
this campaign is not about the past it is about creating a 
future in which all of you can work he said 
gephardt made no attack on dukakis or simon in the final full 
day of campaigning stand with me tomorrow and we will reform 
america he said

new hampshire primary voters put their 
often unpredictable mark on the 1988 presidential campaign today 
with massachusetts gov michael dukakis hoping for a neighborly 
boost from the democrats on the republican side bob dole hoped to 
make it two victories in a row while george bush banked on a 
comeback 
in keeping with longstanding tradition the 34 voters of 
dixville notch cast their ballots shortly after midnight at the 
balsams a resort hotel and gave the edge to bush and democrat 
richard gephardt 
statewide about 150000 republicans and 115000 democrats were 
expected to vote according to william gardner secretary of state 
it feels good like it did in iowa last monday said dole 
referring to the iowa caucus victory that catapulted him to the 
forefront of the race 
but bush who suffered a jolting setback in iowa predicted hed 
bounce back in new hampshire 
i sense a rising tide the vice president said 
bush took some comfort from new hampshires tradition of 
rejecting iowa winners including bush in 1980 and walter f 
mondale in 1984 
all the candidates seven democrats and five republicans 
sounded upbeat about their prospects optimism was bipartisan 
i hope we are going to do a good deal better than people are 
expecting said democratic sen albert gore jr of tennessee who 
was dead last in iowa after pulling his campaign out of the state 
last year 
pat robertson who finished ahead of bush in iowa was in a 
tight battle for third place in the gop primary with rep jack kemp 
and former gov pete du pont of delaware 
i dont know where all those political pundits are today but 
they ran for cover four years ago and theyre likely to run for 
cover tomorrow said du pont 
kemp insisted he too would fool the pollsters im going to 
finish in a good competitive third or higher he said 
robertson hinted he might equal his iowa showing and come in 
second the former television evangelists finish in iowa was far 
stronger than the polls had indicated so no one was willing to 
predict how large his new hampshire following might be 
robertson was trying to distance himself from statements made in 
a debate sunday night when he said there were soviet nuclear 
missiles in cuba that drew a quick denial from the white house and 
criticism from the rest of the gop field 
he initially stuck by the statement on monday but under 
questioning acknowledged he had no firsthand evidence that there 
were nuclear missiles on the island 
democratic sen paul simon of illinois said he was sure hed 
defeat gephardt the missouri congressman for second place and 
referring to dukakis commanding lead in the polls he said i 
think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow 
as it has since 1960 the mountain hamlet of dixville notch was 
the first to report results on the republican side bush received 
11 votes dole had six kemp five du pont two alexander haig two 
and pat robertson one 
the towns seven democratic voters gave gephardt four votes and 
simon three 
i dont think it makes any difference if youre the first vote 
or the last its the vote that counts the privilege said neil 
tillotson 89 town moderator and the communitys patriarch who 
traditionally casts the first ballot just after midnight 
gephardt was the democratic winner in iowa and simon finished 
second and dukakis third in the caucuses there but statewide 
results in new hampshire were likely to be different 
dukakis was the overwhelming favorite with simon and gephardt 
battling for second 
opinion polls consistently gave dukakis the support of between 
36 and 40 percent of democrats 
polls of new hampshire republicans showed a dramatic impact of 
the iowa results bush once the choice of 52 percent of the 
states republicans entered primary day in a virtual dead heat 
with dole 
six candidates appeared at the mall of new hampshire in 
manchester on monday for a rally finale and a chance to pick up 
support among the thousands of holiday shoppers 
from a platform set up between a shoe store and a jewelery shop 
republicans kemp and du pont and democrats gore simon former gov 
bruce babbitt of arizona and jesse jackson delivered abbreviated 
versions of their stock stump speeches 
leadership was a campaign theme sounded in both iowa and new 
hampshire particularly in the struggle between bush and dole but 
the foreign policy debate on the republican side featured more 
hawkish rhetoric in new hampshire than in dovish iowa 
dole who rarely mentioned star wars in iowa made a strong plea 
in new hampshire for development and deployment of the missile 
defense system 
candidates in both parties also emphasized their fealty to low 
taxes an article of political faith in new hampshire 
bush who brought in a corps of congressmen to campaign for him 
on the weekend trumpeted the endorsement of former sen barry 
goldwater of arizona in a television commercial monday 
goldwater the 1964 gop presidential nominee and a hero to 
conservatives called bush the best qualified candidate of my 
lifetime other than me

congressional leaders have assured the 
aflcio that its top legislative priority a trade bill with 
mandatory advance notices of plant closings or mass layoffs soon 
will be sent to president reagan 
but the housesenate compromise that is to emerge probably will 
not include the strict trade imbalancereducing quotas written into 
the house version by rep richard gephardt dmo says house 
speaker jim wright 
wright dtexas told the aflcios executive council here 
monday he had won assurances from senate democratic leader robert 
byrd of west virginia and other key negotiators that the 
housesenate compromise version will be nailed down by march 23 
and on the house floor for final action the following week 
after slightly different versions won easy passage in the house 
and senate last year the trade measure became a dead letter when 
the stock market crashed oct 19 because of fears it would trigger 
more panic selling by stock and bond traders 
white house chief of staff howard baker said last month that 
reagan would veto either version as it now stands as being too 
protectionist the main targets of the administrations opposition 
have been the gephardt language in the house version and a milder 
variation of it along with the mandatory 60day advance layoff 
notices in the senate measure 
no question in my mind well pass a trade bill with 
enough votes to override a veto should that be necessary wright 
said 
he said he met last week with treasury secretary james a baker 
iii and reagans trade representative clayton yeutter expressing 
a willingness to compromise and promising them a vote by the end of 
the year on a separate uscanada free trade agreement wanted by 
reagan 
both house and senate versions of the trade bill require 
countries with free access to us markets to provide the same 
level of access to american exports if a country does not remove 
its tariffs or quotas on us goods the president would have to 
impose the same measures on their exports to the united states or 
justify why he would not do so 
wright said some version of the mandatory advance layoff notices 
will be in the final package despite intense opposition from 
business groups but he indicated the bill likely will drop the 
gephardt language complaining there is too much of a fixation 
on it 
gephardts measure a major theme of his presidential campaign 
would mandate retaliatory quotas or tariffs on some countries if 
they do not reduce their trade imbalances with the united states by 
10 percent a year over a fiveyear period 
gephardts campaign message of threatening koreans with stiff 
us tariffs was credited with reviving his campaign with a victory 
in last weeks iowa caucuses 
labor leaders said the iowa results confirmed their belief that 
the nations record trade deficits and their contribution to the 
loss of more than 15 million manufacturing jobs this decade is a 
if not the dominant political issue 
the public will begin to demand more strongly that something 
effective be done about this decline of the american industrial 
base aflcio president lane kirkland said monday everything 
is going down with it 
wright agreed saying wage scales in many countries with the 
biggest us trade imbalances are so far below those of the 
united states that they are acutally depressing wage scales and the 
standard of living in our country 
nonetheless he predicted the housesenate conferees will agree 
on something in between gephardts language and the senate 
version which targets raising exports to countries with large 
trade surpluses rather than mandating specific trade imbalance 
reductions

authorities cut telephone lines of 
leading lithuanian nationalists and warned citizens of the soviet 
republic that protests marking lithuanias shortlived independence 
would not be tolerated 
on monday 2000 people attended an officiallystaged rally in 
central vilnius to protest alleged us interference in baltic 
affairs 
most participants kept their hands in their pockets and chatted 
with neighbors during the hourlong rally then disappeared down the 
narrow streets of the republics capital 
uniformed and plainclothes police flooded a main street 
cemetery and square where dissidents planned demonstrations today 
the 70th anniversary of lithuanias declaration of independence 
moscow dissidents said nationalists planned to lay wreaths today 
at such sites in vilnius and kaunas the republics second largest 
city and the spiritual center of the lithuanian roman catholic 
church 
lithuanian foreign minister vladislavis mikuciauskas was asked 
by foreign journalists monday if people could mark the independence 
day 
personally yes but it is forbidden to organize anything 
he said 
the moscowbased correspondents barred from traveling to 
lithuania on their own came to vilnius on a tour organized by the 
foreign ministry 
in 1940 the soviets took over the three baltic states 
lithuania estonia and latvia under a secret nonaggression pact 
that nazi germany and the soviet union signed the previous year 
the states had a stormy independence between the world wars 
variously occupied by the germans poles and russians 
about 80 percent of lithuanias 36 million people are of 
lithuanian descent the highest percentage of native population of 
any of the baltic republics 
lithuanian nationalist nijole sadunaite said communist 
authorities had distributed a warning in offices and factories that 
taking part in protests today would be considered an antisoviet 
act 
the crackdown marked a hardening of the kremlins line on 
protests by nationalist groups officials allowed peaceful 
demonstrations in the baltic states on aug 23 the anniversary of 
the nonaggression pact 
the united states never recognized the incorporation of the 
baltic states by the soviet union and us politicians still speak 
out in support of baltic nationalists 
during mondays official rally one elderly man said vilnius 
factory and office workers had been forced to attend the rally the 
man refused to give his name saying he feared arrest 
they just drove them in he said its that simple 
another participant said each vilnius workplace had been told to 
provide 10 people for the rally held next to the citys former 
roman catholic cathedral which now houses an art gallery 
ms sadunaite 49 who served three years in a labor camp and 
three more in internal exile for her role in publishing underground 
catholic literature said her apartment was under kgb guard and 
that her phone was disconnected without explanation sunday 
they shut it off at 10 am without giving me notice she 
said speaking to the associated press from her office 
ms sadunaite said the home phones of other lithuanian activists 
including former political prisoner povilas peceliunas also were 
disconnected 
she said more than 100000 lithuanians attended services sunday 
at vilnius 17 functioning catholic churches and left singing 
traditional national songs 
in kaunas she said hundreds of people visited the grave of a 
national poet and an undetermined number were beaten by police 
when latvians tried to celebrate their national day on nov 18 
police and vigilantes were deployed to keep demonstrators from 
approaching national monuments 
estonian nationalists plan to mark the anniversary of their 
declaration of independence on feb 24

poor management an inability to cooperate and a 
preoccupation with shortterm profits are among reasons american 
business is losing ground to foreign competitors says the first 
report of the mit commission on industrial productivity 
the us economy is still the most productive in the world but 
could be surpassed by other nations that are gaining on it the 
commission reported monday at the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science 
we are talking about keeping the standard of living in the 
united states and enhancing it said michael l dertouzos 
director of the laboratory for computer science at the 
massachusetts institute of technology and chairman of the 
commission in that sense we think productivity is important 
the commission was appointed in december 1986 by mit president 
paul e gray its 18 mit scientists engineers political 
scientists and economists including robert solow last years 
winner of the nobel prize in economics were asked to determine 
the causes of the weakness in us productivity and to make 
recommendations to industry universities and government concerning 
what might be done to correct it 
in its interim report monday the commission listed what it 
believes to be the five principal causes of the decline in american 
productivity 
they are 
excessive attention to activities and investments that are 
profitable in the short run america invented the transistor radio 
color television and the video cassette recorder dertouzos said 
american businesses quickly lost interest in producing them 
however and lost those markets to japan 
parochial attitudes that led american businesses to pay 
insufficient attention to foreign competitors in the machinetool 
industry american firms tried to backlog orders rather than 
aggressively deliver products on time japanese firms promised 
quicker delivery and captured much of the market dertouzos said 
a lack of cooperation within firms among competing firms and 
between firms and their suppliers one reason that japanese 
automakers can bring new cars to market faster than those in the 
united states is that japanese designers and production engineers 
work together more closely than their american counterparts 
dertouzos said 
thats endemic to our educational system said lester 
thurow a commission member and the dean of the mit sloan school of 
management we throw you out of school if you cooperate on an 
exam its called cheating 
weaknesses in human resource management the worker is 
viewed as a cost factor to be minimized rather than as an evolving 
human resource that has to be educated motivated dertouzos said 
failures in applying technology to make simple reliable 
highquality products in the case of vcrs the americans who 
invented them couldnt develop production lines that would meet the 
close tolerances necessary and would do so at an acceptable cost 
dertouzos said 
thurow said the united states clings to certain practices that 
might have served us in the past when our economy was far ahead of 
everyone elses but are not serving us well now 
the united states is the easiest country in the world to hire 
and fire people he said it is the only industrialized country 
where people can be fired at will he said in france to take one 
other example workers must be given one years notice before they 
are dropped thurow said 
while the ability to fire workers might seem efficient in the 
shortterm it provides powerful incentive for workers to sabotage 
innovative technology that might cost them their jobs thurow said 
solow said that the comparatively high cost of borrowing money 
in the united states compared with japan makes it more difficult 
for american firms to profit from longterm investments

citizens of the tiny resort town of 
dixville notch today gave republican george bush and democrat 
richard gephardt the first bragging rights in new hampshires 1988 
leadoff presidential primary 
in the towns traditional balloting at midnight the vice 
president received 11 votes beating his closest gop rival robert 
dole who received six jack kemp received five votes pete du pont 
and alexander haig two each and pat robertson one 
on the democratic side gephardt received four votes and paul 
simon three 
twentynine of the towns voters cast their ballots in 
flagdraped individual voting booths while five votes were cast 
by absentee ballot other new hampshire residents had to wait until 
their polls opened beginning at 6 am 
i dont think it makes any difference if youre the first vote 
or the last its the vote that counts the privilege said town 
moderator neil tillotson 89 who cast the first vote in keeping 
with tradition 
and frequently dixville notch voters have been on target 
in the primary dixville has a pretty good record in choosing 
the eventual candidates for each party said tillotsons son tom 
the town clerk its just when we came to november wed 
frequently be in the wrong party 
in the presidential primaries since 1964 dixvilles voters have 
picked winners eight times a loser once and had two ties 
but in the november presidential elections during the same 
period dixville notch voters have sided with the loser on all but 
three occasions they picked the winners in 1972 when they favored 
richard nixon over george mcgovern and in 1980 and 1984 when they 
sided with ronald reagan 
the elder tillotson came up with the idea in 1960 of making 
dixville notch the first town in the first primary state to cast 
ballots 
tillotson who owns the balsams resort hotel where the votes are 
cast and a surgical glove factory that is the towns only industry 
incorporated dixville notch that year to push the village into the 
national spotlight 
every four years most of the candidates or their surrogates 
make their way five hours north of boston to dixville notch 
population 47 to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south 
of the quebec border they are followed by more reporters 
photographers and tv camera crews than there are residents in town 
residents take seriously their place in political history they 
make sure to be in their voting booths by 1145 pm so they can 
drop their ballots into the ballot box precisely at midnight 
i think it is an honor to be the first in the nation to vote 
and i think people in dixville take it very seriously said 
14year resident gail barba a registered independent who favored 
republican jack kemp 
we realize there is pressure on us and we dont just pick 
somebody we dont know anything about we study the candidates more 
and we make a decision based on that

as a political science major greg lunn 
knew the job description including the fine print still he never 
thought it would come to this 
it is most definitely not the sort of task i had in mind when 
i ran for office he said the other day reflecting on what has 
become topic a across arizona among residents and visitors alike 
the impeachment of the governor 
and im sure he said that i speak for my colleagues of 
both parties 
lunn is one of the 30 arizona state senators who soon sitting 
as a jury will decide whether to restore evan mecham to office 
mecham is now in political limbo impeached by the house of 
representatives 4614 and his gubernatorial duties assumed by the 
secretary of state 
the next step is a trial in the state senate where a conviction 
would require a twothirds vote the trial is scheduled to start 
feb 22 
judging the fitness of a governor to remain in office seems to 
be like cleaning the gutters no matter how ardent the outcry that 
it be done there is no joy in doing it 
stop any senator in the capitol corridors these days and you 
hear phrases like awesome responsibility and nowin 
situation 
mecham a republican won the office with less than 40 percent 
of a light turnout in a threeway election it is safe to say 
says lunn also a republican that to the vast majority of 
arizonans he is the worst governor this state has ever seen 
he has polarized the state instead of practicing the art of 
the possible the art of compromise of bringing people together 
he has brought a narrow ideological and personal agenda and is 
trying to shove it down peoples throats anyone who opposes him on 
any basis instantly becomes an enemy 
even so says lunn to invalidate a constitutionally held 
election is the most sobering act any of us could ever 
contemplate 
lunn 35 has made politics a career unlike nearly all other 
members of the legislature he has no other job he makes no bones 
about planning to run for governor himself some day 
he represents tucson one of the states two urban centers 
where his constituents are about evenly divided between democrats 
and republicans 
however i vote in the impeachment trial yea or nay and i 
wont make up my mind until its time i will not please many of 
my constituents this is true of all of us to a greater or lesser 
degree depending on the makeup of the constituency 
but thats good it will make it easier for us to put aside 
any public or political pressures and make our decision solely on 
the facts as we see them 
another senator carol macdonald feels equally free of 
political pressure but for exactly opposite reasons 
she represents one of the most remote areas in the state her 
home is safford a town of 8000 the largest in the three counties 
she represents she is part owner of the town drug store and served 
as mayor without any party affiliation when the republican senator 
who represented the district for 30 years retired last year her 
neighbors voted for her to take his place she did as a republican 
she says her constituents are predominately mormons she is not 
mormons who number about 200000 in arizona are divided on the 
mecham issue but nonetheless represent a great deal of his support 
i came here to represent rural people who dont have a lot of 
representation in an urbandominated legislature she said but 
i have absolutely no political ambitions beyond doing that duty as 
best i can 
so i feel comfortable about casting a vote because i feel i 
can make a fair decision if it happens that my constituents dont 
like it and dont choose to send me back so be it 
lunn for his part expects the vote to be close 
mecham he points out faces a criminal trial for not reporting 
a campaign loan as well as a may 17 recall election resulting from 
a public petition 
even if some senators feel he is guilty of an impeachable 
offense they could vote against it as an attack on the fairness of 
the process why not use one of these other avenues 
well why not 
because the people have a right to expect a standard of 
behavior in their public officials that does not have as its bottom 
line simply acting lawfully 
thats why the constitution provides for impeachment it is a 
political process not a judicial one a court trial could be long 
and drawn out if there is a conviction there would be appeals 
there is no shortterm way that these matters can be resolved 
but they must be resolved so we can restore some stability to this 
state 
thats why im prepared to do a duty that is extremely onerous 
to do

french quarter today for americas biggest block party where 
madness is a way of life and the only sin is to be a party pooper 
mardi gras or fat tuesday was the crescendo of two weeks of 
nightly prelenten carnival parades in the city that care forgot 
as early as noon monday the lines were a half block long 
outside pat obriens bar a popular watering hole in the quarter 
and the nonstop party was just getting started narrow streets of 
the citys old section were wall to wall with revelers 
as the party grew jazz and fireworks heralded the arrival of a 
costumed standin for rex the king of carnival who disembarked 
from a coast guard cutter at the riverwalk shopping mall on the 
mississippi river just outside the quarter 
by midnight george moore and his friend don granda both from 
st louis were getting into the swing of things at mollys pub a 
crowded bar on the quarters river edge moore said it was his 15th 
mardi gras 
this has always been my second home he said last year 
was great and were hoping good weather will make this one just as 
good if it is ill need five days to sleep when i get back to st 
louis 
the first of 17 organizations scheduled to take to the streets 
today was jazz clarinetist pete fountain and his half fast marching 
club preceding the real rex along a route winding past the stately 
homes of the garden district to canal street in the central 
business district on the edge of the quarter 
in the quarter women on wroughtiron balconies often bare their 
breasts and gay bars play host to male crossdressers barely clad 
in various combinations of womens underwear hosiery high heels 
feathered headresses and beaded gowns 
todays crowds could surpass the estimated 1 million people that 
jammed metropolitan area streets last year said police spokesman 
john marie 
the day officially concludes at midnight tonight with the 
meetings of the courts of rex and comus signaling that mardi gras 
has given way to ash wednesday and 40 days of lenten sacrifice 
last year police were criticized for clearing the streets after 
mardi gras with a little too much vigor assistant police chief ray 
holman said officers will be more gentle this year but no less 
insistent 
in nine days preceding the 1988 celebration police had made 
1434 arrests 79 fewer than last year a police spokesman said 
in mamou 160 miles west in the heart of cajun country mardi 
gras is celebrated but in a different way

of 3200 for courir du mardi gras or the running of the mardi 
gras in which masked horsemen canter from house to house 
soliciting the makings of a giant gumbo at dinner time those 
still in the saddle gallop into town to toss their gleanings into 
the pot 
the cajun country towns of eunice lawtell and ville platte also 
celebrate courir du mardi gras but mamous celebration is the 
biggest

a union leader and people in managua 
complained that the governments new attempt to combat runaway 
inflation through currency and economic reforms has sent consumer 
prices soaring 
on monday the government began trading one new cordoba for 
1000 old ones and raised salaries up to seven times their december 
level 
it also increased prices and ended government subsidies for a 
host of staples ranging from rice to beans milk sugar and 
cooking oil 
last year inflation reached at least 1500 percent 
president daniel ortega announced the reforms in a broadcast 
address sunday declaring that 10 new cordobas would buy one us 
dollar 
the new measures enforced by the government has left us in an 
even worse state than we were before said nilo salazar general 
secretary of a 30000 member federation of construction unions 
nicaraguans have until wednesday to exchange up to 10 million 
old cordobas at 2000 booths the government has set up across the 
nation bank deposits are being adjusted automatically 
under the reform package the governmentsubsidized price of 
gasoline jumped fivefold overnight to 15 new cordobas a gallon 
gasoline is rationed at 17 gallons a month for private automobiles 
salazar said people in his federation say they are worse off 
than before 
as an example he cited an assistant bricklayer whose monthly 
salary has risen from 191808 old cordobas to 79250 new ones 
a liter of milk which yesterday cost 2500 old cordobas now 
costs 660 new cordobas or 6600 old cordobas that is to say 
these prices have gone up more than 60 percent salazar said 
the leftist sandinista government has said the new measures will 
benefit wage earners in the long run by reducing inflation 
the revaluation is also an attempt to do away with the black 
market where a dollar had until monday been worth up to 60000 
cordobas 
on the official market used to import machinery petroleum and 
other essential goods a dollar had cost 70 cordobas while it was 
worth 21000 cordobas on the parallel market 
a pound of beef which used to cost 25000 cordobas now costs 
35 cordobas that means that an assistant bricklayer has to work 
1093 hours to buy one pound of meat salazar said 
an urban bus ride which the government wont subsidize anymore 
will now cost half a new cordoba against 10 old cordobas 
they those in the government think they can deceive 
people felix carnonel a 26yearold carpenter asked as he 
waited in line monday outside a bank to change his old cordobas for 
new ones 
angel moreno 40 a mechanic complained that a housemaid will 
not be able to buy anything with the 500cordobas a month minimum 
salary that she gets paid when a pound of beef costs 35 cordobas 
a dozen eggs 25 cordobas and bread from 7 to 10 cordobas a pound 
many of shopkeepers closed their doors monday to adjust their 
prices and to change old cordobas for new ones 
but at managuas huge oriental market a center of black market 
dealing in foreign currency it was business as usual black 
market dealers and stallkeepers accepted both old and new cordobas 
three days were allowed for the exchange during which only 
newspapers fuel medicine and medical services could be purchased 
with the old bills in addition the government established a 
temporary radio service to provide information on the currency 
exchange 
ortega has blamed nicaraguas economic problems on the 
6yearold war with ussupported contra rebels and an american 
trade embargo according to the government the two factors have 
cost nicaragua 38 billion in lost income

iraq today claimed its warplanes hit a 
supertanker in the persian gulf after raiding iranian troops along 
the war front 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said iraqi 
warplanes attacked a very large maritime target a common 
reference to a supertanker off the iran coast overnight it did 
not give the exact time of the raid 
the agency quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying 
the iraqi air force will continue to destroy naval targets that 
ferry iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance 
the aggression against iraq 
the news agency quoted a military communique as saying that 
iraqi jets flew 60 combat missions earlier monday along the war 
front inflicting substantial losses in men weaponry and 
equipment then returned safely to base 
it said iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed iranian 
military posts in 39 sorties destroying many of the enemys 
troop buildups and positions it gave no details 
iran did not comment on the iraqi claims however iran said its 
outnumbered air force jets attacked a petrochemical complex and 
military installations in southern iraq on monday 
a communique issued in tehran and carried by the official 
islamic republic news agency said the iranian warplanes heavily 
bombarded iraqi positions and fortifications along the southern 
front east of the iraqi city of basra and in faw peninsula farther 
south 
iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in basra 
in one of five raids carried out by early monday afternoon irna 
said in a dispatch monitored in nicosia all the attacking 
fighters returned safely to bases after inflicting heavy casualties 
and losses on the enemy it said 
reports by iran and iraq which have been at war since 1980 
cannot be independently verified because they rarely allow access 
to combat zones 
irans air force is outnumbered 8to1 by iraqs fleet of 
soviet and frenchmade aircraft 
however in recent weeks iran has used its usmade planes in 
several raids suggesting tehran may have bought spare parts on the 
black market iran has 6070 operational warplanes according to 
western military analysts

less than a week after deciding to permit 
closed meetings during the trial of impeached gov evan mecham the 
state senate is considering whether to scrap the idea 
senators also decided monday to reconsider whether to begin the 
trial feb 22 as scheduled or agree to mechams request and delay 
it until after his criminal trial 
majority leader robert usdane urged his fellow senators monday 
to change rules adopted thursday that would allow them to hold 
closed discussions at the request of only one senator 
even though it was never the intent of the senate to hide from 
the public or to railroad or exonerate the governor in private 
the press has intimated that this type of situation would not only 
be possible but probable behind closed doors usdane said 
in a formal motion filed later monday mechams attorneys also 
asked for open discussions 
absent a compelling reason the principals of fundamental 
fairness dictates that every moment of these impeachment 
proceedings the importance and gravity of which cannot be 
overstated be witnessed by the citizens of this state and 
nation defense attorney rick miller wrote 
surreptitious meetings held in smokefilled back rooms will 
cast a dark cloud of suspicion over the hearings he added 
calling it nothing but a farce sham and a mockery for the 
senate to meet secretly 
a twothirds vote is required to change the rules 
the president of the arizona newspapers association joe 
soldwedel praised usdanes appeal we would like all of the 
proceedings to be in public he said the associated press has 
filed a similar request 
usdane in a letter to senate president carl kunasek and 
minority leader alan stephens urged that all deliberations be in 
public and that closed meetings either be banned entirely or at 
least require a majority vote 
this will allow the public to know the senators who voted for 
a closed conference he said 
usdane also said he might boycott closed meetings if the changes 
are not adopted 
several rankandfile republicans said they favored a change 
and stephens a democrat said he believed his caucus also would be 
willing to go along with changes 
mecham is accused by a house resolution of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan lending 80000 to his car dealership from the 
governors protocol fund and obstructing justice the republican 
governor has said repeatedly that he is innocent of all wrongdoing 
mecham also faces a criminal indictment over the 350000 loan 
and a may 17 recall election precipitated by a petition drive

president kurt waldheim dismissed a 
rising chorus of calls for his resignation by saying he would not 
retreat in the face of slanders hateful demonstrations and 
wholesale condemnations 
in a nationally televised speech on monday waldheim said his 
conscience was clear about his wartime conduct and he appealed for 
the trust of you my dear austrians and for national unity 
but by reiterating his refusal to quit in the 14minute speech 
the president appeared certain to deepen divisions in austria 
caused by a report by a panel of international historians on his 
wartime past 
in the 202page report issued last week the six historians 
questioned waldheims moral integrity saying he was in close 
proximity to nazi atrocities during world war ii and did nothing 
to stop them 
though the panel said it found no evidence waldheim had 
committed war crimes it concluded he tried to cover up his 
involvement in world war ii which was disclosed nearly two years 
ago during the presidential campaign 
the government appointed the panel at waldheims request after 
the united states put him on a list of undesirable aliens which 
effectively forbids him to enter the united states 
walheim a former un secretarygeneral admitted in mondays 
speech that he might have erred in not discussing his past as a 
german army lieutenant in the balkans from 1942 to 1945 but he 
insisted he had never tried to conceal it and had a clear 
conscience 
without giving specifics he told austrias 75 million citizen 
that parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are 
built on presumptions and hypotheses for that reason the 
conclusions drawn cannot be upheld 
waldheim 69 appealed both to world war ii compatriots and 
those too young to know the horrors of this war to judge for 
themselves whether your president is the distorted picture of 
this officer of the wehrmacht or a man who for decades of his 
life worked for justice tolerance and peace 
he said resigning would be against the wishes of those who 
elected him 
waldheim said a convincing majority had elected him to a 
sixyear term in june 1986 and added a head of state must not 
retreat in the face of slanders hateful demonstrations and 
wholesale condemnations 
waldheim won 536 percent of the vote in a runoff 
calls for waldheims resignation including street 
demonstrations have increased since the report was issued 
in an 80minute interview for abctvs nightline program 
broadcast early today waldheim said his military service in 
hitlers army was a common experience for austrians 
if one pretends that i was lying because i did not give all 
the details of my military career right from the beginning this is 
not something that i can accept he said 
serving in the german army was the normal fate of a young 
austrian of lets say 20 22 years of age to make him responsible 
for the wrongdoings of hitler or the nazi army which i condemned 
this in not fair 
socialist politicians who opposed waldheims election as 
titular head of state were swift to condemn the speech but the 
presidents conservative backers in the peoples party lauded the 
performance 
the two parties have governed in an increasingly fractious 
coalition since national elections in november 1986 left neither 
with a clear majority 
socialist party secretary heinrich keller called the speech a 
great disappointment and indicated the country could do without 
waldheim as president 
the socialists have stopped short of calling outright for 
waldheims resignation on sunday however socialist chancellor 
franz vranitzky said that he might resign if too much of his time 
is consumed by the waldheim affair 
alois mock austrias deputy chancellor and head of the peoples 
party said waldheims speech was brutally open and maintained 
that the fuss would soon die down 
but economics minister robert graf another leading 
conservative said in a radio interview that waldheim must take a 
decision which is very important for our country 
in a radio interview several hours before the president spoke 
graf said he was concerned about austrias tainted image and 
praised the comments vranitzky made sunday

a federal jury turned down a wrongful death 
suit filed by the widow of former indiana university football 
player denver smith against the city of bloomington and three 
police officers 
we were disappointed very very disappointed cynequa 
smith who had sought 18 million in damages said after the 
verdict monday 
mrs smiths lawsuit claimed police officers had violated her 
civil and constitutional rights as well as those of her late 
husband and the couples 4yearold daughter when they fatally 
shot smith during a struggle over a gun on sept 12 1983 
mrs smiths attorney rich d hailey said he would decide 
within a week whether an appeal would be filed 
mrs smith claimed her husband was mentally impaired when he was 
shot her lawsuit alleged negligence on the part of bloomington 
police officers steven sharp randall keller and james ratcliff 
defense attorney doug king said in closing arguments sunday that 
the three officers did only what they had to not what they 
wanted to do 
in his instructions to the jury us district court judge john 
d tinder said they were to balance the plaintiffs claim that 
smiths rights were violated by the excessive use of force with the 
defendants contention that using deadly force was reasonable 
because the officers had cause to believe smith posed a threat to 
their safety and lives 
smith was from dayton ohio

charged with criminal trespass a misdemeanor before they were 
released on their own recognizance said police officer john lyons

since the beginning of the school year but was not yet certified 
she said school officials considered her a substitute teacher 
when a teacher at another school received certification the two 
were directed to switch classrooms as of monday but ms degroot 
showed up monday in her old classroom to protest 
ms degroot 40 said she hopes the protest will persuade the 
school board to put her back in her classroom but she realizes it 
may jeopardize her future as a teacher in chicagos schools 
ms degroot was told she was being transferred thursday after 
school was over and since friday was a school holiday she said 
had no chance to say goodbye to her pupils 
children become very attached with a teacher so it is very 
traumatic for them its very traumatic for me too ms degroot 
said in a telephone interview monday night 
the protesters met monday night and decided to start picketing 
in front of the school this morning ms degroot said 
a teacher is not something to be ripped away from them without 
a chance to say goodbye said rickley whose three children 
attend another school 
most of the students who were in the room when it was seized 
about 9 am monday were removed and assigned to other classrooms 
after police arrived an hour later said aracelis figueroa a 
district superintendent for the city board of education four 
students whose parents were involved in the protest remained in the 
room throughout the daylong demonstration she said 
we figured this kind of thing was a great civics lesson 
rickley said 
removing their teacher was something the children understood 
as very unfair said rickley who knows ms degroot from north 
river community church the baptist church where he preaches 
ms figueroa said ms degroot wants to be placed back at 
brentano but there is no such thing as assigning anyone 
permanently to a school as a substitute 
a substitute is just a substitute ms figueroa said

hundreds of students rallied in the rain 
outside a university of massachusetts building to support its 
occupation by black students protesting campus racism 
many of the estimated 200 students held lighted candles and sang 
during the rally monday night outside the new africa house 
officials said 
earlier in the evening the dozens of students occupying the 
building evacuated it after a telephoned bomb threat said 
protester spokesman dwayne warren they returned about 10 minutes 
later when campus police found no bomb warren said 
the students said they planned to present a revised list of 
demands to chancellor joseph duffey this afternoon but refused to 
provide details 
classes scheduled for new africa house today were to be held in 
other buildings because the university does not plan to evict the 
students and because several faculty members refused to teach there 
during the protest said university spokesman james langley 
we see this as a shortterm temporary thing we dont want to 
escalate tensions langley said adding that officials hoped a 
resolution to the dispute could be reached following the meeting 
between duffey and the students 
the occupiers began getting support from white students monday 
as students began trickling back to campus after a long holiday 
weekend several returning students said they had left before the 
building was taken over friday and had been unaware of the protest 
between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the 
weekend said roscoe robinson 24 of boston a spokesman for the 
protesters 
the number fluctuates as people come and go but at least 60 
have remained in the building at all times robinson said 
when asked how protesters were spending their time he 
responded were studying were students 
weve set aside the third floor of the building as a study 
hall and some of the graduate students with us who are teaching 
assistants are working with students robinson said 
the students had been scheduled to meet monday with duffey but 
the session was canceled because he left campus to visit an ill 
brother 
after becoming aware of the illness the protesters sent duffey 
a sympathy card signed by more than 200 students duffey responded 
by sending them a fruit basket and a card reading i send 
affection and respect 
the takeover was sparked by the alleged beating last weekend of 
two black students by six whites following a dormitory party 
a group of graduate students monday were organizing an effort to 
have white students and faculty wear black armbands in support of 
the protest 
its a symbolic gesture but the racism on campus has gone on 
for too long and is far too prevelant said graduate student 
frank tripoli its time to begin putting an end to it 
among the initial demands presented to university officials last 
week was that five white students allegedly involved in the weekend 
beating be suspended 
robinson refused to discuss specifics of the revised demands 
until duffey had a chance to review them robinson said the thrust 
of the demands remained unchanged but that the students had 
revised the wording to make them more acceptable to administrators 
about 9 percent of the 25000 students at massachusetts largest 
public university are minorities there are 641 blacks enrolled and 
about 500 are undergraduates langley said total undergraduate 
enrollment is about 19000 students

about 1300 chinese students returned home last 
year after completing studies in the united states leaving 27000 
chinese at american universities and colleges 
the official china daily today said 8817 scholars have returned 
from the united states since china began sending students abroad in 
1979 
chinas overseas study program has become a matter of 
controversy because of the large number of students who are 
refusing to come home opting instead for the better jobs and 
living conditions they find abroad some of those who have returned 
have had difficulty finding suitable work and readjusting to the 
rigid political and social norms of their native country 
the beijing government last year announced regulations 
tightening controls over students going abroad and requiring they 
be ideologically and morally sound however officials stress 
that china is still committed to sending students overseas to learn 
skills needed in the nations modernization drive

police say they have interviewed about a 
dozen people but have made no arrests in connection with fires that 
have charred schools and churches and forced children in this town 
into makeshift classrooms 
six fires have been set in the past three months starting in 
early december when one of the towns two elementary schools was 
torched twice within eight days authorities said 
two churches which opened their doors as temporary classrooms 
for north omak elementary school students and a church parsonage 
have been set afire during the last two weeks the latest blaze 
destroyed omak first presbyterian church early monday 
last week the free methodist church sustained about 200000 in 
damage and another fire set there saturday caused 30000 in 
damage said omak assistant police chief mike cramer another blaze 
hit the methodist parsonage next door on sunday cramer said 
omak fire chief cal bowling said the latest church fire 
apparently was set by an intruder who broke into a basement window 
flanked by evergreen trees 
fire police and sheriffs investigators met behind closed doors 
monday to chart investigative and security plans a 7500 arson 
information reward fund was set up under the washington insurance 
council 
police chief peter sirois said police had interviewed about a 
dozen people and among them were two of three persons of 
interest 
investigators also were seeking to talk to four or five more 
sirois said he said two of them no longer live in the area but 
frequently return for visits 
he said investigators have limited phsyical evidence and the 
next step is just a lot of hard work including steppedup 
surveillance 
pastor elbert g harlow who lives across the street from the 
presbyterian church said a roving custodiansecurity guard woke 
him early monday to alert him to the fire 
its got everybody on the edge he said theyre nervous 
waiting to see whats going to happen next 
added mary koch managing editor of the weekly omak chronicle 
its affected everyone in town people are very very grim 
cramer said there was no doubt that an arsonist was behind the 
fires in december and january that destroyed the elementary school 
arson also was the cause of the blazes at the methodist church he 
said 
theyre a kook someone who is unbalanced said vic 
power superintendent of omaks school district 
he said school officials have checked their records for any 
former employee or student who might have a grudge but have turned 
up nothing 
cramer said the citys eightperson police force is making every 
effort to catch the arsonist whose work is beginning to take a 
psychological toll on the towns 4000 residents and its 1800 
students including 450 from north omak elementary 
when the first fire hit the school it devastated the kids it 
was tough for them to move now theyre going to have to again 
he said 
counselors and volunteers were helping children and parents cope 
with the fires power said the town has purchased trailers that 
will be used as temporary classrooms he added

pakistan today called on the soviet 
union to rejoin efforts at finding a formula for a future afghan 
government rather than pulling troops out of that country 
unconditionally 
the pakistan foreign ministry gave a statement to reporters 
saying that only by linking its proposed withdrawal to an agreement 
on an interim kabul government could moscow assure an end to 
afghanistans nineyear civil war 
the withdrawal of its forces must be accompanied with 
arrangements to ensure peace and stability inside afghanistan 
otherwise the tragedy of afghanistan will continue the 
statement said 
a ministry spokesman who cannot be named under news conference 
rules said moscow has changed its position on a socalled 
twintrack approach to reaching a unsponsored accord on ending 
the soviets eightyear role in the war 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev issued a statement feb 8 
setting a pullout date of may 15 provided that indirect talks 
between the islamabad and kabul governments produce an accord at 
least 60 days before that 
however gorbachev also stated for the first time that a pullout 
would not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a 
transitional afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout 
this according to pakistani officials means that fighting 
between afghanistans governing communists and the afghan 
guerrillas could continue preventing the return of 35 million 
afghan refugees who reside in pakistan 
the spokesman also claimed that the absence of a political 
accord would make it impossible for pakistan to abide by a key 
element of a peace agreement already accepted by islamabad kabul 
washington and moscow an end to foreign military aid to afghan 
guerrillas 
if the refugees continue to camp just miles from this very 
porous border with afghanistan it will be impossible for 
pakistan to guarantee foreign noninterference he said 
the islamabad and kabul governments who have negotiated 
indirectly at geneva through un mediator diego cordovez have 
agreed on the principles of noninterference afghanistans future 
status as a nonaligned country and the voluntary return of nearly 
5 million refugees from pakistan and iran 
at the next round of talks scheduled for march 2 they are to 
concentrate on the details of a withdrawal of soviet troops 
moscow and washington would serve as guarantors of an accord as 
the united states gives substantial military aid to the afghan 
guerrillas 
an agreement at the next geneva round predicted by cordovez and 
the pakistanis alike would ostensibly mark the end of the soviet 
armys involvement in the conflict 
the moslem insurgency in afghanistan began in 1978 before the 
soviet intervention in december 1979 ostensibly at the request of 
the moscowbacked afghan communist regime and under the auspices of 
a friendship treaty 
western analysts estimate 115000 soviet troops are now fighting 
moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the marxist government

residential neighborhood of tehran wounding 10 people damaging 
shops and shattering apartment building windows the official 
islamic republic news agency reported 
the car was parked on a street in northern tehran said the 
agency which was monitored in nicosia it said those wounded in 
the blast were taken to a hospital where three were admitted and 
seven discharged after treatment 
irna said the bomb was planted by agents of the world 
arrogance but gave no other details 
the explosion came five days after ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
islamic revolution celebrated the ninth anniversary of its rise to 
power

public for setting off car bombs in tehran and bakhtaran in 
western iran it did not elaborate on the bombings but said the

and rigging them with explosives

of irans religious hierarchy and 100 miles south of the capital 
killed 33 people and wounded more than 200

inspectors for the occupational safety 
and health administration could shut down unsafe plants and 
construction sites under a major overhaul of the nations primary 
job safety law advocated by the aflcio 
although no such legislation is under consideration now the 
executive council of the 143million member labor federation said 
monday it wants congress to change the 17yearold osha law once a 
new president is elected 
the acts penalty structure and criminal provisions must be 
strengthened the 36member council of union leaders said in a 
statement those provisions are badly out of date and fall far 
short of those provided in more recent safety and health laws such 
as the mine safety and health act 
inspectors for oshas sister agency the mine safety and health 
administration now have the authority to shut down any unsafe mine 
on the spot osha inspectors lack that power except in rare 
circumstances and even then they must first obtain a court order 
the aflcio measure also would expand coverage under the osha 
law to include workers in the nuclear and transportation industries 
and some 14 million employees of state and local governments all 
of them are exempt now 
in addition it would mandate safety and health committees with 
union or other worker representation at each job site 
the committees would have the right to conduct their own 
inspections review an employers hazard control measures and 
direct a shutdown of a dangerous job site on their own said 
margaret seminario the federations deputy director for safety and 
health 
the initial reaction by labor department officials attending the 
aflcios annual winter meeting here was positive 
but assistant labor secretary david demarest said any 
consideration of amending the law would first require a major 
policy review within the department that kind of action is not 
even in the planning during the last year of president reagans 
administration he said 
business groups also want the law changed but in a different 
way the us chamber of commerce has called for legislation that 
would mandate costbenefit analyses now being practiced as policy 
under by adminstration before osha can issue new or toughen 
existing health and safety regulations 
the chamber also wants to prohibit osha from interference in 
issues that it says more appropriately belong under the 
jurisdiction of the national labor relations board such as 
responding to every worker complaint with a plant inspection as 
now required by the law 
in the past year unions have helped workers file complaints of 
unsafe conditions with osha that have resulted in fines ranging up 
to more than 25 million against companies such as ibp corp the 
nations largest meatpacker and international paper co

the nations baby boomers are poised for the 
first time to swing a presidential election according to a 
university of minnesota research fellow 
theres a good chance the baby boom vote could play a key role 
this year said harry boyte a research fellow at the humphrey 
institute of public affairs 
boyte said a candidate who shows concern about the economy job 
security home ownership and the future of children can win baby 
boomer votes 
he said however that would require tapping an underlying 
social concern among older baby boomers who fought for civil 
righs and womens issues and awakening a political interest in 
younger baby boomers who have generally shunned activism 
but bill morris a private pollster in the twin cities says 
theres a coalition out there waiting to be mobilized but that 
none of the presidential candidates is doing it 
but some political analysts say it cant be done because the 
baby boomers are too varied to fit under one political banner

when harbor pilot wright skinner jr 
fell into winyah bay he became the fifth person to disappear in 
the bay on feb 13 in the past 11 years 
i dont think ill go fishing on feb 13 next year said 
dean jordan whose father and cousin drowned in the bay on feb 13 
1982 it is a little unusual because the day my father 
disappeared out there the winds were coming from the northwest and 
it was cold these were the same conditions when mr skinner went 
out 
ive heard people call that area in winyah bay the devils 
triangle said bobby goude who helped search for jordans father 
and cousin as a volunteer with the winyah rescue squad 
skinner a second generation harbor boat pilot had piloted the 
freighter tropical sky out of winyah bay and was returning to the 
trailing pilot boat when he apparently fell from a ladder leading 
down to the awaiting boat he landed in the mid40degree water at 
330 am saturday 
skinner has not been found volunteers searched the area for 
four hours monday until foul weather forced them to stop 
we will continue to search until the family says they want us 
to stop said glenn wilson chief of the winyah rescue squad 
the coast guard has discontinued its search until further 
developments a spokesman said 
on feb 13 1977 david browder and john stanley gore went to 
search for a friend in their 10foot outboard their boat was found 
overturned the following day while their friend was found safe in 
his stalled boat the bodies of browder and gore were found later 
in charleston about 60 miles south of georgetown 
on feb 13 1982 hubert jordan sr and his nephew david jordan 
left port in their 18foot boat to go shad fishing when they 
didnt return after dark a relative tom swinnie jr went in 
search of them swinnie found the bow of the jordan boat sticking 
out of the water 
david jordans body was found 32 days later and hubert jordan 
sr was found 50 days later both near charleston goude said 
there are other stories about the mysteries of the bay 
two guys told me they were out on the bay one time and they 
saw three men on a 40foot shrimp boat out there and they turned 
their backs to the boat for a minute and when they turned around 
the boat and the men were gone and they never found it or the 
men goude said my soninlaw got stuck out on the bay about 
two weeks ago and he said he was never going back because it was

three birth control organizations serving colorado 
and utah have won a temporary reprieve from new federal rules 
barring federally funded family planning clinics from advising 
pregnant women on abortion 
us district judge zita l weinshienk granted a preliminary 
injunction monday against the new rules scheduled to go into 
effect march 3 sought by rocky mountain planned parenthood of 
denver planned parenthood of utah and the boulder colo womens 
health clinic 
she said the order applies only to the three plaintiffs clinics 
the order just says the government cannot put these 
regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a 
final hearing weinshienk said in an interview 
the judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a 
week she said two similar cases will be heard in federal courts in 
boston and new york this week 
the denver suit claims the new regulations violate the title x 
statute and the intent of congress censure free speech rights at 
family planning clinics and violate the right of privacy of clinics 
and their patients 
the department of health and human services ruled that family 
planning programs receiving federal funds may not provide pregnant 
women with information on abortion or refer them to other sources 
even if they ask 
reagan administration officials have said the rule is intended 
to make sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion even 
indirectly 
weinshienk accused the reagan administration of trying to use 
the regulations to circumvent congress and amend legislation that 
set up title x of the public health service act in 1970 to provide 
family planning clinics 
legislative history includes a groundswell of support in 
congress for womens rights to abortion even three years before the 
supreme court decision legalizing abortion in 1974 she said 
she said the new regulations represented a 180degree switch 
from past interpretations of the statute by previous 
administrations 
weinshienk said she based her decision on many us supreme 
court rulings that barred rules that dictated to doctors what 
they say to patients which is what the regulations attempted to 
do

the plo today threatened to attack 
israeli targets around the world to avenge the killing of three 
guerrilla commanders and the bombing of a ferry being readied for a 
protest voyage by palestinian deportees 
the palestine liberation organization has blamed israel for the 
slayings on sunday and the explosion aboard the sol phryne ferry on 
monday 
israel knows that the plo is not handcuffed the blood of 
our martyrs will not go unavenged said a statement issued in 
nicosia 
the plo officers col marwan kayyali lt col mohammed sultan 
and lt col mohammed buheis were killed in a car bombing in 
limassol on cyprus southern coast apparently after arranging the 
sale of the cypriot ship to a ploaffiliated firm for the socalled 
ship of return voyage to israel 
we had adhered to the cairo declaration to halt military 
operations against enemy targets outside the borders of our country 
israel the statement said it is not logical or possible for 
the halt to continue unilaterally this is a doubleedged weapon 
it added 
plo chief yasser arafat declared during a visit to the egyptian 
capital of cairo in 1985 that his guerrillas would restrict their 
attacks in the arabisraeli conflict to targets inside israel and 
halt terrorist attacks on israelis abroad a policy the plo had 
pursued since arafat took over its leadership in 1969 
an official at the plo office in nicosia said today there are 
alternatives we are not desperate when asked what the plo 
planned to do after the explosion that crippled the sol phryne 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity would not say 
whether the plo has found another boat to charter for the 130 
deportees and hundreds of sympathizers and reporters who planned to 
go on the voyage to protest the deportation of palestinians from 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the plo had tried to launch the voyage from greece but it was 
repeatedly delayed reportedly under israeli pressure 
the deportees sympathizers and reporters were taken in buses to 
athens airport monday and were told they would be flown to cyprus 
to board the boat after news of the blast reached athens most 
returned to their hotels 
another plo official in nicosia had disclosed that the 
40yearold ferry which was sold saturday only a few days before 
it was to be auctioned had a hole blown in it by an underwater 
blast caused by a mine that was stuck probably by frogmen onto 
the vessel it was attached to a time fuse 
the boat was supposed to sail to the israeli port of haifa but 
israeli officials have said they will refuse to let the vessel 
enter their waters 
the planned voyage resembles in some ways the 1947 trip of the 
exodus in which jewish refugees from nazi death camps were turned 
back by british forces as they tried to emigrate to palestine 
in athens bassam abu sharif the plos chief spokesman who has 
been overseeing preparations for the voyage said on monday we 
are continuing our plans and we will sail in spite of israeli 
terrorists who are using bombs against ideas noble ideas 
fouad albittar the plo diplomatic representative in athens 
said the damage to the ferry is not very severe 
but the ships captain cleanthis vlahopoulos said it would 
take several months to make the sol phryne seaworthy again 
a man claiming to speak for the jewish defense league on monday 
said the usbased extremist group was responsible for the device 
that planted the 6151ton sol phryne 
the jdl is responsible for the bombing at limassol he said 
this is only a warning next time we will bomb it with all the 
people on it 
the man made the claim in a telephone call to the associated 
press but there was no way to authenticate it or verify the 
callers identity 
he said no comment when asked if the jdl also was behind the 
car bombing that killed the plo officials snday 
the jdl advocates use of violence in the arabisraeli conflict 
it was founded in the early 1960s by new yorkborn meir kahane now 
a member of israels parliament and head of extremist antiarab 
kach party 
the head of the jewish defense league irv rubin told the ap in 
a telephone interview on monday from los angeles that jdl was not 
involved

a teacher a scientist and a linguist 
are adrift at sea with only enough food and water for one to 
survive before their raft reaches an island inhabited by a 
primitive civilization 
who should be allowed to survive to enlighten the natives 
the question of which field of learning is most important may be 
as sticky as the one involving the chicken and the egg but three 
professors took it on during a raft debate at the university of 
tennessee at chattanooga 
thomas g waddell a chemistry professor opened the debate last 
thursday by noting that he knew how to make aspirin antibiotics 
and synthetic fabrics 
if im saved we can wear something besides animal skins he 
said faulkner should not be read nor classes taught while 
dressed in animal skins 
but eugene bartoo the schools head of curriculum and 
instruction countered the notion of better living through 
chemistry 
im sure the island is looking forward to polyester leisure 
suits one of the special contributions of chemistry to our 
lives he said before arguing that his ability to train others 
to teach made his specialty the most valuable 
reed sanderlin an english professor and language specialist 
argued that without a means to translate thoughts into written 
words the islands residents would have difficulty teaching others 
or assimilating technology 
mr waddell can work magic but what happens when he dies 
sanderlin asked mr bartoo can lead these children along the 
beach and show them the possibilities of curriculum reform but 
what happens after that 
all of these things are important sanderlin said the 
trouble is that at some points in history you cant have them all 
at the same time and you must make choices

and causing vomiting diarrhea and fever is common to shanghai an 
overcrowded city with serious sanitation problems

confrontations between strikers and replacement workers lt donald 
boyle said 100 officers would be assigned to watch towing companies 
on staten island 
albert cornette president of local 333 of the international 
longshoremens association said his 2500 members on monday 
unanimously rejected companies demands to eliminate 750 jobs and 
for wage and benefit concessions from 40 percent to 62 percent 
we offered them a contract to keep them competitive

the government plans to enact into permanent law 
an antiterrorism measure it introduced to counter the ira 
allowing police to hold people without charge for a week news 
reports said today 
the reports come at a time of worsening of angloirish 
relations recently dublin suspended the processing of extradition 
warrants from britain 
the british broadcasting corp the times of london and other 
newspapers said prime minister margaret thatchers government plans 
to enact the prevention of terrorism act instead of having 
parliament renew it annually 
the act would apply to all of britain to make it permanent 
mrs thatcher must submit it to parliament for approval 
the home office refused to confirm the reports but said in a 
statement that home secretary douglas hurd is likely to be making 
an announcement on the matter the times said the announcement 
would come today 
dublin has criticized the act so its permanent enactment is 
thought likely to worsen angloirish relations which deteriorated 
sharply last month over britains refusal to prosecute police who 
allegedly killed six unarmed roman catholics in northern ireland in 
1982 
the act intended as a temporary measure when first introduced 
in 1974 as a means to help combat the irish republican army is now 
also used against international terrorism in general 
it allows police to hold people without charge for up to seven 
days without having to inform anyone or bring them before a court 
the irish government of prime minister charles haughey alleges 
that british police have used the act to harass irish people and 
gather information on the irish community in general 
in some cases irish government ministers have been held at 
british airports under the act leading to diplomatic complaints 
critics say more than 1 million people have been detained under 
the act at one time or another but that less than 200 were 
subsequently convicted of any offense british government figures 
show that of 225 people held under the act last year only 27 were 
subsequently charged with an offense 
but mrs thatchers government says the act has played a major 
role in fighting terrorism the government said the act allowed 
police in june 1985 to prevent an ira bombing campaign in mainland 
british resorts 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to drive the british from 
northern ireland it wants to unite the predominantly protestant 
province with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic under 
socialist rule 
haughey said after meeting mrs thatcher at the european 
economic community summit in brussels on friday that relations 
between the two governments were at an impasse 
it was the first meeting between the leaders since the london 
government on jan 25 acknowledged there was evidence of a 
conspiracy to obstruct justice following the killing of six unarmed 
catholics by police in three separate incidents in northern ireland 
in 1982 irish anger was sparked by britains announcement that it 
would not prosecute the officers allegedly involved 
dublin meanwhile has suspended processing british extradition 
warrants for suspects wanted in northern ireland and the british 
mainland the irish times reported monday it said the dublin 
government had accused british authorities of failing to comply 
with terms of a new extradition law the irish parliament passed 
dec 10 
the terms include a requirement that supporting evidence should 
accompany requests for extradition and attorney general sir 
patrick mayhew of britain has refused to do so 
irish press reports said that as a result irish law officers 
have since taken no action on at least five british extradition 
warrants none of which concerned terrorist cases

rios raucous carnival greeted the 
dawn today with a spectacular but socially conscious samba parade 
capping off a night of revelry that spread from night clubs to the 
slums 
the last of rios top 16 samba schools paraded through the 
80000seat openair sambadrome this morning ending a 12hour 
parade and capping a glittering display of costumes music and 
dancing 
samba schools actually are neighborhood clubs located mostly in 
rios poor hillside slums each one composes a samba based on a 
historical folk or political theme and then outfits 4000 to 5000 
members who sing and enact that theme along the parade route 
most of the schools stuck to traditional samba themes however 
as 1988 marks the 100th anniversary of the emancipation of brazils 
slaves this years parade saw added emphasis on the role of black 
people 
blacks and mulattoes make up a majority of the samba schools but 
in general do not hold positions of wealth or authority in this 
mixedrace nation of 141 mi

a few puddles were all that remained of the water at 
the trevi fountain on tuesday as surveyors began measuring the 
landmark for a facelift but that didnt stop visitors from 
throwing coins into its empty basin 
the water was turned off so that workers could carry out a 
photographic survey in preparation for the first restoration of the 
17th century fountain in more than 30 years 
the restoration is aimed at removing discoloration caused by 
smog the project will last a year but will proceed in stages and 
the water will run in the parts of the fountain where the work is 
not being done

an engineer accused of running a stop signal 
and driving three freight locomotives into the path of a speeding 
passenger train pleaded guilty today to one count of manslaughter 
in amtraks deadliest crash ever 
the state agreed to drop 15 other manslaughter counts against 
former conrail engineer rick l gates in the jan 4 1987 crash 
baltimore county states attorney sandra oconnor told circuit 
court judge joseph f murphy 
the crash killed 16 people and injured more than 170 others the 
names of the other 15 victims will be added to the single count of 
manslaughter by locomotive 
the agreement was announced as jury selection for gates trial 
was to begin mrs oconnor said the state has reserved the right 
to ask for the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a 
1000 fine sentencing was set for march 29 
gates was operating three conrail locomotives that prosecutors 
say ran the stop signal in chase and wound up in front of an 
amtrak train traveling about 120 mph 
after the hearing gates told reporters outside the courthouse 
i am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence 
i cant begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families i 
am sorry he said 
according to the statement of facts read in court today the 
signals told gates to slow the locomotives to 30 mph and then to 
stop before reaching the switch 
the statement said that former conrail brakeman edward cromwell 
would have testified that he smoked a marijuana cigarette with 
gates in the train cab however experts could not agree whether 
the marijuana would have impaired gates performance said the 
statement agreed to by both sides 
the summary also said gates failed to correct five safety 
violations before he took the locomotives out of the conrail yard 
for the trip to harrisburg pa including a failure to have a 
working whistle and speed warning light and adequate train radio 
susan horn whose daughter ceres millicent horn was killed in 
the crash cried and shook her head as the 48page statement was 
read 
federal investigators have said gates 33 of essex failed to 
notice the stop signals because of marijuana and possibly alcohol 
use gates has denied smoking marijuana while operating the train 
testimony had been expected to focus on drug use warning 
whistles and lights in the locomotive cab and a series of approach 
signals to the switch where four tracks converge to two at the 
gunpowder river railroad bridge 
cromwell has been granted immunity and had been expected to 
testify that he and gates fabricated a story to cover up their 
marijuana smoking on the train 
chief public defender donna shearer said that defense attorneys 
will try to discredit cromwell by pointing out that he ran from the 
scene while gates stayed to help save lives 
gates attorneys said they will present evidence that the track 
signals often malfunction contrary to official statements 
the county grand jurys indictment announced may 4 accused gates 
of gross negligence 
gates who worked for conrail for 14 years has said signals 
indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch 
but the national transportation safety board concluded that 
gates failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the 
cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol 
blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed gates and 
cromwell had traces of marijuana in their bodies but a recent 
court ruling in a different case could have hampered use of this 
evidence by prosecutors 
the men were tested under a federal railroad administration rule 
requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a 
serious accident but the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san 
francisco ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional 
the railroad administration has said it will appeal and the 
rulings effect on the trial remains uncertain it stands as 
official precedent only in the circuit courts area which does not 
include maryland but may affect judicial thinking elsewhere 
even if the evidence had been allowed prosecutors would have 
had to prove gates was impaired by the drugs not just that he was 
using them 
the trial could have implications for government control over 
train operators and for more than 294 million in civil suits 
arising from the crash the railroad administration has said the 
crash already has helped it in its battle for federal control over 
licensing and training of engineers 
the federal government had no authority to punish gates or 
cromwell both of whom resigned from conrail

austrian president kurt waldheim says his 
service in hitlers army reflects the normal fate of a young 
austrian during world war ii and says he wants the united states 
to release secret documents about his past 
in an interview on abctvs nightline broadcast early today 
waldheim reiterated that he had a clear conscience and would not 
step down as president despite growing opposition within austria 
i have not hidden anything of my military career he said 
i think this whole accusation is unfounded 
he gave the 80minute interview to the network monday 
immediately following a short televised speech to the austrian 
nation in the speech he said that he rejects the conclusions of a 
panel of experts commissioned by the austrian government to review 
his war record 
in a 202page report issued last week the six historians 
questioned waldheims moral integrity saying he was in close 
proximity to nazi atrocities during world war ii and did nothing 
to stop them 
though the panel said it found no evidence waldheim 69 had 
committed war crimes it concluded he tried to cover up his 
involvement in world war ii which was disclosed nearly two years 
ago during the presidential campaign 
in his interview with abc waldheim maintained that he could 
still function in the ceremonial post of austrian president despite 
the controversy about his past he was elected in june 1986 with 
536 percent of the vote 
the 69yearold former united nations secretarygeneral said the 
united states in putting him on a list of undesirable aliens last 
year had committed a serious violation of international law 
no state has a right to put a foreign head of state under its 
own jurisdiction he said 
waldheim said he wanted to appeal the ruling and have the secret 
documents it was based on made public but he said the state 
department said the only way to appeal the ruling was to apply for 
a visa which he said was unacceptable to a head of state 
waldheim lashed out at those who said he is lying about what he 
knew and those who cite as evidence that in his writing about his 
past he left out the details of his military career he said his 
military service in hitlers army was a common experience for 
austrians 
if one pretends that i was lying because i did not give all 
the details of my military career right from the beginning this is 
not something that i can accept he said serving in the german 
army was the normal fate of a young austrian of lets say 20 22 
years of age to make him responsible for the wrongdoings of hitler 
or the nazi army which i condemned this is not fair 
at the end of the interview waldheim appealed for understanding 
from the american people 
if i have misled my friends in the united states because i 
didnt say anything as far as my military career is concerned i am 
sorry it was not done purposely believe me and i hope this 
will be understood because i have so many friends in the united 
states and i hope they will believe me that i havent done 
anything wrong

two us navy warships have left the black sea 
after an incident last week in which they were deliberately bumped 
by soviet ships off the coast of crimea the pentagon said tuesday 
the cruiser yorktown and the destroyer caron steamed 
uneventfully through the turkish straits and back into the 
mediterranean sea on monday the pentagon said 
spokesman dan howard declined to say where the two ships were 
now bound 
the yorktown and caron entered the black sea on feb 10 under 
orders to assert international navigation rights as a result last 
friday the two ships moved inside the 12mile limit claimed by the 
soviet union while steaming past the crimea peninsula 
in response two soviet warships deliberately bump the sides of 
the yorktown and caron causing minor damage and prompting the 
united states to file a protest with moscow 
unlike the soviet union the united states claims a threemile 
territorial limit the united states accepts other nations claims 
of a 12mile limit but it insists that foreign nations honor what 
is known as the right of innocent passage for ships passing 
through waters between three and 12 miles offshore

announced their candidacies for us senate seats today while 
pennsylvania republican sen john heinz iii began his campaign for 
a third term at a pittsburgh subway stop 
in lake worth fla us rep dan mica said he would run for 
the democratic senate nomination despite polls showing he is far 
behind former gov reubin askew 
its going to be a long 10 months mica a 44yearold 
former teacher told nearly 200 supporters and students at palm 
beach junior college were going to walk the state were going 
to run the state were going to crawl the state if we have to 
were going to win 
in st paul minn attorney general hubert h humphrey iii 
declared his senate candidacy after months of testing the political 
water 
heinz 49 on monday began a twoday series of campaign stops to 
announce his candidacy by telling a pittsburgh crowd that economic 
aid and help for the elderly are two of his priorities 
heinz one of the wealthiest senators said he was impatient 
with congressional inaction on jobtraining assistance trade 
legislation catastrophic health insurance and prescription drug 
insurance for the elderly 
also monday former philadelphia city controller joseph vignola 
filed petitions to enter the april 26 primary for the democratic 
nomination to oppose heinz greatgrandson of the founder of the

the new hampshire of white steepled 
churches and treelined lakes still exists but when presidential 
candidates want to find lots of voters they go to malls that could 
just as easily be in new jersey as in new hampshire 
gone are the small southern new hampshire farms whose owners set 
up stands to sell eggs and sweet corn to weekend drivers from 
massachusetts theyve been replaced by hightech companies and 
suburban sprawl 
also ebbing is the personal touch that has been a hallmark of 
many new hampshire campaigns 
there was a time when new hampshire voters really did meet 
presidential candidates shake hands and question them eye to eye 
met most of them and often met them more than once 
but most people who voted in the state primary on tuesday 
especially those who live south of concord the state capital got 
no closer to a candidate than their television sets 
maybe that doesnt matter 
dayton duncan who was deputy press spokesman for walter f 
mondales 1984 presidential campaign is working on a book about 
the new hampshire primary in four bitterly contested primaries he 
points out the winner never set foot in the state 
when dwight d eisenhower beat robert a taft in 1952 and henry 
cabot lodge upset barry goldwater in 1964 the winner not only 
shook no voters hand he wasnt even in the country 
lyndon b johnson beat eugene mccarthy in 1968 and jimmy carter 
defeated edward m kennedy in 1980 in both cases the winners were 
incumbent presidents under severe challenge they won without ever 
campaigning personally in the state 
although he lost mccarthy did well enough to startle observers 
and send the first clear message that johnson was in political 
trouble 
in 1976 president gerald r ford campaigned three days in new 
hampshire and still beat challenger ronald reagan 
the north country most closely resembles the new hampshire of 
post cards and calendars nestled in the valleys of the white 
mountains are scores of towns and pristine lakes stands of pine 
and white birch 
but look closely also part of that landscape now are massive 
condominium developments second homes to thousands of people in 
the northeast corridor 
in fact candidates run the risk in new hampshire that the hand 
they shake may mark a ballot in some other state 
george bush greeted voters at pheasant lane mall the states 
newest and biggest enclosed paradise for shoppers it sits on new 
hampshires southern border and the odds are that the vice 
president met more people from massachusetts than from new 
hampshire 
six candidates spoke at a rally finale at the mall of new 
hampshire their platform was set up between the florsheim shoe 
store and zales jewelers 
huge television screens projected the candidates images 
throughout the covered mall and that was how most people saw them 
shoppers who tried to crowd in close enough to actually view a 
candidate in the flesh were frustrated by a platform set up for 
television cameras 
we cant see we cant see they chanted 
it was new hampshire in 1988 at least thats what the sign on 
the platform said

the dragon swallowed the rabbit at midnight 
tuesday beginning a threeday party and a new year named for the 
symbol of china lucky for business marriage and the dragon 
babies born before it ends 
nearly everyone in hong kong wealthy businessmen factory 
workers maids restaurant waiters left their jobs to welcome the 
lunar new year with feasts gambling and visits to relatives with 
gifts of candy and lai see lucky money for all the children 
they know and many they dont 
posters in the gleaming subway system urged celebrants not to 
carry such traditional objects as lighted joss sticks and roasted 
pigs onto the trains 
markets in china were crammed with festival foods railroad 
stations were full of holiday travelers and signs emblazoned with 
dragons heralded the start of the year 4686 named for the most 
auspicious of the 12 animals in chinese astrology 
thousands of people from taiwan to which the chiang kaisheks 
nationalists fled after the communist victory of 1949 were 
expected to visit the mainland last year taiwans government 
lifted a ban on visits to allow family reunions 
at new year normally thrifty chinese throw financial caution to 
the winds and blow several months pay on good cheer gifts and 
games of chance 
government statistics indicate about 400000 of hong kongs 57 
million people had left by tuesday for holidays abroad and many 
more were expected to go 
the probeijing china travel service estimated 18 million 
people from hong kong would spend the holiday in china primarily 
in the neighboring province of guangdong where many have their 
ancestral roots 
a company official said about 6000 people from taiwan were 
expected to visit the mainland 
hong kong businesses began closing during the day tuesday in 
anticipation of the holiday which officially ends friday but will 
run through the weekend for many extra service was added to the 
city transport system to deal with the mobile feast 
a fireworks display that cost more than 230000 is expected to 
attract hundreds of thousands of people to the shores of victoria 
harbor on thursday night 
in china the holiday has been renamed spring festival for the 
1949 communist victory and traditionally is the most important of 
each year 
stateowned newspapers say the luck believed to accompany the 
dragon has led to a dramatic increase in the number of couples 
registering for marriage in hopes of having a dragon baby the 
papers describe the attitude as feudal and lecture against it 
over the past decade the communist authorities have taken a 
more relaxed attitude toward other new year customs formerly 
classified as fedual 
folk fairs at temples and former temple sites have been revived 
giving the holiday some of the traditional flavor 
a temple fair at dragons pool park in beijing one of the 
years special dragonrelated activities attracted more than 
50000 people monday 
the fair is the largest in the capital with more than 10 
troupes providing folk entertainment and several hundred stalls 
lining the halfmilelong rim of the pool selling 100 varieties of 
snack foods folk art toys and clothing 
officials have restricted the supply of fireworks because of 
casualties and damage caused in the past the new year customarily 
was greeted with a deafening roar of firecrackers which continued 
virtually nonstop for several days 
about 27 million worth of fireworks were sold in beijing last 
year and some families spent as much as 200 yuan 54 the 
equivalent of two months pay 
this year the government reduced the supply by 30 percent 
fireworks were blamed last year for 3040 fires that killed 17 
people and caused nearly 1 million in damage

bob dole dueled george bush for republican 
advantage tuesday in new hampshires kickoff presidential primary 
while massachusetts gov michael dukakis bid for a decisive victory 
in the democratic struggle for supremacy and survival 
the first returns as always came from tiny dixville notch 
which gave 11 votes of hope to vice president bush and 6 to dole 
seven notchers went democrat split 4to3 between secondplace 
contenders rep richard gephardt and sen paul simon 
preelection polls said the gop race was a tossup with kansas 
sen dole propelled by victory in last weeks iowa caucuses and 
bush struggling to rebound from a disappointing thirdplace finish 
there 
rep jack kemp and former delaware gov pete du pont their 
candidacies at stake bid for third place against pat robertson in 
the first test for the former television evangelist in a primary 
election 
to a man they said new hampshire voters would deliver a surprise 
its going to be an interesting contest robertson said 
during a chance electionmorning encounter with simon i met 
three of em that voted for me early so i hope that holds 
dukakis rivals conceded him a victory in advance they vied for 
second place and hoped to deny the massachusetts governor a huge 
victory that would give him a boost for the delegaterich contests 
ahead 
sen albert gore jr jesse jackson onetime frontrunner gary 
hart and bruce babbitt were back in the pack in the new hampshire 
surveys with babbitt and hart hoping to avoid a drubbing that 
would doom their campaigns 
gephardt and simon who finished onetwo in iowa and just ahead 
of dukakis engaged one another in an angry fight over some simon 
tv ads critical of gephardts voting record 
were gonna run very well simon said tuesday morning as he 
aimed to upend the missouri congressman and further scramble the 
wideopen democratic race 
dukakis cautioned anything can happen new hampshire voters 
are very independent but he was confident enough to talk about 
his plans for march 8 when 20 states including 14 southern or 
border states will hold super tuesday primaries or caucuses 
were going to contest every one of those states dukakis 
said i think were going to surprise some people in the south 
in terms of delegates new hampshire was small stakes indeed 
democrats were allotting 18 of their 22 delegates to the national 
convention next summer with 23 spots at stake on the republican 
side 
but it wasnt delegates that drew the candidates and their 
television advertising dollars to a sparsely settled state with a 
reputation for upsetting frontrunners and elevating upstarts it 
was the prospect of momentum and the ability to attract campaign 
funds needed next month 
then again as new hampshire boosters never tire of pointing 
out no one has ever won the white house without a victory in the 
firstinthenation primary since the granite state started going 
first in 1952 
there was every reason to believe that for some the first 
primary would also be the last 
babbitt conceded that new hampshire voters had power of life and 
death over his quest others were less direct though kemp and du 
pont were locked in a struggle with each other and robertson to 
emerge as a conservative alternative to the frontrunners 
dukakis the favorite son had a different concern his aides 
pointed out that the largest margin in history for a contest of 
this sort was 11 percentage points 
and they worried aloud about winners in past democratic 
primaries in new hampshire being viewed as losers because they did 
worse that expected lyndon johnson in 1968 and edmund muskie four 
years later

the traditional new hampshire marathon became a sprint this year 
in the eight days following last monday nights iowa caucuses iowa 
jumbled the field somewhat setting up doles confrontation with 
bush here and giving impetus to robertsons hope to outlast kemp 
and du pont among conservatives 
within days of his iowa victory dole gobbled up bushs once 
oncecommanding lead in the new hampshire polls and said a 
followup win here might all but assure him the nomination 
the vice president retooled his style and his campaign message 
in a bid to regain his footing scrapping the trappings of his 
office he largely abandoned formal speeches in favor of 
campaigning in a ski parka and driving a forklift around a 
lumberyard 
he pleaded guilty to the faults of poor oratory and lack of 
passion on the stump but said that shouldnt be mistaken for lack 
of concern here i stand warts and all he said recalling 
abraham lincolns words if he wasnt embracing president lincoln 
it was president reagan and bush ended his new hampshire effort in 
the same new boston nh town hall where reagan ended his in 1980 
if reagan were not coattail enough bush campaigned monday with 
new england baseball hero ted williams and conservative hero barry 
goldwater 
dole riding the crest of his iowa wave tried not to offend 
i want to be nice to everybody this week he said even so he 
couldnt resist a few jabs at bush as he vied with the vice 
president for the support of reagans admirers 
he did what i did in 1980 bush said early tuesday of dole 
he won in iowa and came in and talked about momentum i did what 
president reagan did he reagan came in and started talking the 
issues as ive been doing and i think its working 
kemp branded bush and dole as certain tax raisers and du pont 
thrust a notax pledge in front of dole during a debate and 
demanded that he sign it he didnt 
kemp unable to afford a fourthplace finish behind robertson 
attacked the former minister for deliberate distortions on his 
television advertising and in printed flyers 
robertson whose secondplace finish was the surprise of iowa 
said new hampshire might be startling too but he found himself 
embroiled in an eleventhhour controversy when the white house 
denied his startling claim that there are soviet nuclear missiles 
in cuba and he was peppered with questions about statements he 
made over the years from his tv ministry 
dukakis benefited from his decades service as governor of 
neighboring massachusetts and his longstanding opposition to the 
unfinished seabrook nuclear power plant his aides watched 
anxiously to see whether gephardt would develop a tidal wave of 
momentum following his iowa win but it never materialized in the 
polls 
gephardt delivered the same antiestablishment message that 
carried him to his iowa victory but he found himself trying to 
fend off attacks that he had flipflopped on numerous issues over 
the years and fell into a nasty battle with simon 
when you say in a tv ad who do you trust youre really 
bring into play motives motivation and whether or not somebody is 
reliable and i think that goes over the line said gephardt 
whose campaign demanded that simon withdraw his commercials 
simon refused and said gephardt was campaigning as a supporter 
of reaganomics in new hampshire after posing as an opponent in iowa 
gore a no show in iowa spent time and money in new hampshire 
and hoped to develop a nonsouthern base but he diverted some of 
his television money off into southern and border states a fresh 
indication that his eggs are in one basket the southern states

pundits wrong in counting him out of the democratic race

prominence in 1984 and said his comeback would continue no matter 
what 
jackson like gore looking for substantial support in the south 
chastised the others in a debate and urged his rivals to address 
the issues he did better than expected in iowa and hoped to finish 
in doubledigits in new hampshire

the pentagon faced with an adverse court 
ruling has rescinded a virtual ban on security clearances for 
naturalized citizens from countries deemed hostile to us 
interests 
a federal judge who barred the pentagon from enforcing the 
regulation against two naturalized citizens from vietnam was 
informed by the defense department that the april 8 1987 
regulations had been rescinded and the lawsuit against them was 
moot 
united states citizens born in countries designated as hostile 
or who have resided in those coutries for significant periods of 
their lives will be considered for security clearances on an equal 
basis with naturalborn citizens government attorneys told us 
district judge thomas f hogan in a memo filed last friday 
on feb 3 hogan enjoined the pentagon from enforcing the 
regulations against phong t huynh an electrical engineer at the 
naval surface warfare center and his sister vien u huynh a 
computer scientists at the same facility in dahlgren va 
the two had fled their homeland in 1978 by boat with other 
refugees and emigrated to the united states where they both 
obtained their formal education and american citizenship the 
huynhs filed suit to challenge the regulations after being told 
they would likely lose their security clearances and their jobs 
when he granted an injunction in the huynh case hogan urged the 
pentagon to rescind the regulations to avoid a lengthy court 
battle the judge said the regulations appeared to be unreasonable 
and unconstitutional 
the regulations generally barred security clearances for us 
citizens who had immigrated from 29 nations deemed hostile to the 
united states besides vietnam the list of countries included 
soviet bloc nations cambodia ethiopia iran iraq laos 
nicaragua syria and libya 
an individual who was born in one of the 29 countries would be 
eligible to obtain a security clearance only if the person had been 
an american citizen for at least five years or has resided in this 
country for at least a decade

champion market animals will be tested 
for drugs for the first time this week at the san antonio livestock 
exposition but no animal stands to lose a ribbon because of 
doping officials said 
this is the first stock show where anything like this is being 
done in the nation dr larry ehrlund a san antonio veterinarian 
who is coordinating the tests told the san antonio expressnews 
show officials said monday that testing of champion market 
steers lambs and barrows is part of a survey by the texas 
veterinary medical association 
this is strictly for our information and the texas veterinary 
medicine associations information as to whether they do have 
drug residues said richard traylor of the sale executive 
committee 
we have no idea whether we have a problem or we dont have a 
problem traylor said this is more of a survey for 
information 
tests are designed to detect 25 different compounds representing 
just about every potentially abused drug imaginable ehrlund 
said 
veterinarians are concerned that some show animals might be 
given drugs such as diuretics tranquilizers or anabolic steroids 
which give the owner an unfair advantage he said 
a similar program will be conducted at the stock show in san 
angelo next month and at other shows in texas 
no decision has been made about releasing the results or about 
what policy to set for next year concerning the tests traylor said

honor the order of lenin in honor of his 70th birthday the tass 
news agency said tuesday 
announcement of the award appeared to solidify the position of 
shcherbitsky long rumored to be in trouble with mikhail s 
gorbachevs reformminded leadership one day before a plenary 
meeting of the communist party central committee 
the policymaking central committee is the only group empowered 
to make changes in the ruling politburo shcherbitsky has been a 
full member of the ruling body since 1971 
shcherbitsky and his ukrainian party organization have come in 
for sharp criticism for failing to meet targets for industrial and 
farm production in a jan 26 report the communist party newspaper 
pravda said a meeting of top ukrainian party officials criticized 
shcherbitsky and other top officials by name 
it said local officials receive too many directives from the 
top even though central authorities are inefficient and seem to 
not have worked out a general development plan for the republic 
shcherbitsky has survived other criticism and predictions that 
he was about to be ousted perhaps indicating that gorbachev does 
not have the strength to replace him or does not want to risk

the discovery of two species of the 
daddylonglegs insect family in edgewood county park may block a 
proposed 18hole golf course 
both species are called the edgewood park harvestman of 
sitalcina minor they live only in serpentine rock formations in 
the parks hills and several conservationists want the habitate to 
be preserved 
constructing a golf course would wipe out the whole harvestmen 
populations said thomas f briggs a science teacher at san 
francisco lowell high school 
these are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world he 
added 
briggs discovered one of the species in 1983 and the other in 
1985 both have eight legs and bright orangered bodies that 
measure about 1 millimeter unlike spiders daddylonglegs do not 
spin webs 
along with darrell ubick an entomologist briggs has submitted 
a proposal to the us fish and wildlife service asking that the 
species discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected 
creature which could halt any development of their only known 
habitat 
san mateo county purchased the 468acre site in 1980 from the 
state and has been attempting to build a golf course there for 
several years 
this little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a 
golf course said barbara kootz of nearby san carlos a golfer 
and leader of prodevelopment interests in the area

the opening of a sixbed hospice for dying 
aids patients has drawn protests from neighbors who say they arent 
afraid of catching the deadly disease but do fear the facility will 
lower property values 
the shawn hughes hospice named after the man hospice officials 
say was the first employee of the nearby city of west hollywood to 
die of aids opened monday in a leased bungalowstyle 
threebedroom home 
unhappy neighbors say they fear the hospice will bring 
ambulances hospital supply trucks and eventually cars from the 
county coroners office to their quiet residential street 
its like living next to a hospital said tom meleck whose 
home is directly behind the hospice 
but city councilman michael woo said the hospice is not a 
hospital but a place where aids patients can die with respect 
and dignity 
some residents had attempted to keep the facility from opening 
saying it needed a zoning variance to operate in the neighborhood 
but the city attorneys office said that hospices could operate in 
residential zones as long as they were kept to a maximum of six 
beds woo said 
alex hensel who leased the home to hospice los angeleslong 
beach said he was shocked by his neighbors reaction 
what i found out is that except for the two closest neighbors 
the rest were only concerned about property values after so 
many years here im going to lose hensel said 
this isnt a hospital he added its just a chance for 
people in their last few days to have some warm feelings in their 
hearts 
hospice los angeleslong beach operates two other hospice 
facilities in long beach the newest hospice costs 7000 a month 
to run and operators are hoping for a 200000 county grant to pay 
bills for the rest of the year 
without it we may have to close this place down said 
executive director ron wolff 
more than 1200 people in the hollywoodwilshire area were 
diagnosed between 1981 and 1987 as having aids said peter kerndt 
medical director of the los angeles county aids epidemiology 
department sixtytwo percent of them have died 
until now there has been no facility in the city that gives 
the victims who are our neighbors a decent place to die in 
peace woo said this is long overdue

iraq said tuesday its warplanes made the 
25th air raid of the year on an iranian tanker in the campaign to 
destroy irans oil exports and end the 7yearold war 
only a few of the raids have been confirmed by shipping agents 
salvage executives or other independent sources 
iran said its aircraft made a damaging raid on a petrochemical 
plant near basra iraqs southern provincial capital the report by 
the official islamic republic news agency gave no details and iraq 
did not comment 
another usescorted convoy of reflagged kuwaiti tankers made 
its way down the persian gulf and a new navy command ship the 
coronado arrived in the gulf with four other american warships 
a dispatch from the official iraq news agency news agency said 
warplanes attacked a very large maritime target the standard 
phrase for a supertanker off the iranian coast overnight 
it did not give an exact time for the raid and there was no 
independent verification 
the news agency quoted a military spokesman not identified as 
saying iraq will continue to destroy naval targets that ferry 
iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance the 
aggression against iraq 
iran uses its own and chartered tankers to move crude oil from 
the kharg island export terminal in the northern gulf which is a 
frequent target of iraqi bombers to makeshift terminals in safer 
waters about 450 miles down the gulf 
included in the usescorted convoy which left kuwait on 
sunday were the 294739ton townsend an oil products carrier and 
the 46723ton liquefied gas tanker gas princess escorted by the 
missile frigate reuben james 
it was the 12th this year and 36th since convoys began last 
july the united states has given us registration and american 
flags to 11 kuwaiti tankers so the navy can protect them 
the 17000ton coronado will become flagship of the us middle 
east force in the gulf and the la salle command ship in the region 
for many years will undergo a major overhaul at yokosuka japan 
the coronado did similar duty in 198182 
in other changes the 18000ton helicopter carrier okinawa is 
leaving and command will be transferred in late february to rear 
adm anthony less from rear adm harold j bernsen 
other navy arrivals the missile cruiser wainwright and frigates 
samuel b roberts simpson and jack williams replace departing 
ships but the okinawa will not be replaced when it sails for 
california this week with the last four minesweeping helicopters 
us officials say withdrawal of the okinawa which will cut the 
gulf force from 17 ships to 16 is part of a plan to reduce the 
cost of the escort operation now running at an estimated 25 
million a month 
both iran and iraq reported raids on military and other 
installations at the southern end of the 730mile border war front 
the activity appeared connected to iranian preparations for a 
longanticipated winter offensive 
diplomatic sources in kuwait say iran has marshaled about 
300000 men in the southern area near basra where it has mounted 
several major offensives since the war began in september 1980

medicare budgettrimming has squeezed hospital 
profits to the point where health care for the elderly could be 
threatened according to testimony tuesday before the house aging 
committee 
the hospital operating profit margins are just one indicator 
that the federal government may have cut into the heart of an 
alreadyshredded safety net protecting the elderly said rep 
edward r roybal dcalif the committee chairman 
hospital average profit margins under medicares payment system 
were above 14 percent in 1984 and 1985 then dropped to 96 percent 
in 1986 according to federal statistics projections show that 
hospitals on the average will lose money on medicare patients by 
next year 
we are approaching a critical juncture where further 
reductions and a lack of predictability could begin to have an 
effect on the provision of care to this nations elderly and 
poor said a statement submitted by the american hospital 
association 
congress at white house urging has enacted in the past few 
years a cost control system for medicare and president reagan is 
expected to propose further belttightening in the fiscal 1989 
budget he submits on thursday 
the medicare program doubled in cost between 1980 to 1987 to 
80 billion and is expected to exceed 100 billion next year 
dr donald young executive director of the prospective payment 
assessment commission which reports on the medicare payment 
system said the downward trend in hospital profits appeared to be 
continuing and the access of medicare beneficiaries to quality 
care could be threatened 
however he said the most important reason for the profits 
decline was not a reduction in medicare payments but the continuing 
increases in hospital costs there have been few signs recently 
that hospitals are changing their behavior to increase efficiency 
or productivity he said 
eric shulman legislative director for the national council of 
senior citizens said the figures may have grave consequences for 
all older americans in part because of industry priorities 
i find it unconscionable that the hospital industry would 
first react to news of declining profits by threatening to subject 
patients to lowerquality care and to deny them all the care they 
may require he said

new hampshires survivors turn south on wednesday for the next 
major battleground of the presidential campaign with tennessean 
albert gore jr hoping to waylay the frontrunners on his home 
ground but northerner michael dukakis saying he is conceding 
nothing 
among the republicans george bush is counting on superior 
organization in the south to hold off bob dole and pat robertson 
is hoping a strong showing in south carolina can give him a boost 
heading into the super tuesday primaries 
democrat dukakis the massachusetts governor said tuesday in 
new hampshire were going to contest every one of those states 
i think were going to surprise some people in the south 
jesse jackson a southerner like gore was welcoming the change 
of scenery to a region where he has been at or near the top in 
polls of democratic voters his support is particularly strong 
among southern blacks 
after new hampshire several candidates were heading to south 
dakota and wyoming where lowerstake contests are scheduled between 
now and march 8 
but it is on that date known as super tuesday that more than 
onethird of the states will vote including most of the south in 
the closest thing ever to a national presidential primary and most 
of the candidates are responding by turning their attention time 
and money southward for what gore called the main event of the 
campaign 
what they will find is a massive territory where a thorough 
television campaign means buying airtime in 20 or more separate tv 
markets thats an enormous expense and obstacle particularly for 
those such as richard gephardt and paul simon who are saddled with 
debt 
gore the tennessee senator who claimed a pass to super tuesday 
regardless of new hampshires verdict said in washington on 
tuesday that jackson would be his principal competitor in the south 
he criticized jacksons defensecut proposals said his own 
experience was more directly relevant and said democrats in 
all parts of the country are really hungry for a victory in 1988 
and interested in finding a nominee who can offer the best chance 
of beating the republicans in the fall 
jackson in recent speeches has argued against what he says is 
a common though oftenunspoken view that he cannot win in 1988 
because he is black no matter how well he does in the south and 
elsewhere 
on the republican side robertson was pointing to south 
carolinas gop contest on the saturday before super tuesday the 
expected low turnout of that primary combined with robertsons 
constituency of fundamentalist christian voters made that 
biblebelt state a likely spot for another strong showing by the 
former television preacher 
while dole engaged bush in the new hampshire primary the vice 
president was said to have a far superior organization throughout 
the south it was a strong southern organization in a much more 
limited regional primary that rescued former vice president 
walter mondales nomination hopes after he fell short in new 
hampshire in 1984 
still bill brock doles campaign manager said of the bush 
campaigns claim to have a firewall of support in southern 
states its made of straw straw burns pretty fast 
gephardt the democratic winner in iowas caucuses last week 
seemed a likely candidate to oppose gore for the 
moderatetoconservative southern democratic and independent vote 
that gore has been trying to appeal to since laying out relatively 
conservative stands on defense and foreign policy issues last fall 
dukakis has a strong southern organization and was seen as 
particularly strong in florida 
i think gephardt is the one with the most potential to do well 
among southern white voters besides gore said merle black a 
university of north carolina political scientist 
he can take votes away from gore said claibourne darden an 
atlantabased polltaker and analyst 
facing that possibility gore had begun stressing an appeal to 
bluecollar voters in contrast to his earlier strategy of 
concentrating on endorsements from the southern political 
establishment 
he toured a mill in north carolina last week and stood in a 
virginia train yard with johnny cash where he shouted this party 
and our country has to stand up for the average working men and 
women 
the southern campaign will include at least three republican 
debates and four among the democrats 
dukakis has been the most successful fundraiser among the 
democratic candidates and thus at an advantage in the southern tv 
wars but gores campaign has been hoarding its money and he said 
he will spend at least 2 million in the region 
gore campaign manager fred martin said we must do well on 
super tuesday theres no ifs ands or buts about it we have a 
threeweek campaign

the united states will discuss the resumption 
of aid to fiji and send an ambassador to the pacific archipelago in 
an attempt to encourage the countrys return to democratic rule 
the state department said tuesday 
in view of recent developments in fiji that have set that 
nation on a course leading to the restoration of constitutional 
government ambassadordesignate leonard rochwarger will be 
proceeding to fiji in the near future to assume his duties in 
suva said spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
the previous us ambassador ended his tour of duty in fiji 
prior to the may 14 1987 coup which overturned the islands 
parliamentary democracy and brought to power col sitiveni rabuka 
the ambassador was not immediately replaced partly as a sign of 
us displeasure with the military takeover 
the united states continues to deplore the circumstances that 
undermine democratic institutions in fiji said mrs oakley at 
the same time the return of executive authority to civilian hands 
and the public commitment of the interim civilian government to 
a process aimed at restoring constitutional government is a 
positive step that we wish to encourage she added 
fiji returned to civilian rule in december when rabuka 
appointed former governorgeneral sir penaiai ganilau as president 
and ganilau returned sir kamisese mara to his former post of prime 
minister rabuka retains control of security matters 
mrs oakley said the state department was also starting 
consultations with congress on resuming the 13 million dollars in 
economic aid which was suspended following the may coup congress 
is expected to unfreeze the funds

defense secretary fidel ramos said 
tuesday that harsher laws are needed to combat the 19yearold 
communist insurrection and recalled that he asked earlier for the 
death penalty to be restored 
but he said said the rebellion was not at the stage where a 
state of national emergency was needed while president corazon 
aquino was quoted as saying suggestions she would impose martial 
law were ridiculous 
ramos noted at a news conference that 18 months ago he 
recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the 
military fight the new peoples army these included lengthening 
the time suspected rebels could be held without charge and 
restoring the death penalty for heinous crimes such as treason 
and rebellion 
after a thorough assessment of the insurgency situation and 
the efficacy of the various government countermeasures and 
programs the position of the defense department and military is 
that the present situation is not i repeat not of such gravity 
as to make compelling a declaration of a state of emergencythe 
defense chief said 
there is no need for the public especially the international 
audience to be put in a state of alarm and apprehension over this 
issue 
ramos was apparently trying to spike widespread speculation that 
the military was pressuring the government to declare martial law 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
told reporters he discussed the issue tuesday with the president 
and she assured him she would not declare a state of emergency and 
never really seriously considered it 
cory even described the idea of resorting to martial rule as 
ridiculous he said 
the senator said congress had moved to improve the militarys 
effectiveness but that calls for a state of emergency were 
counterproductive here the philippines has bitter memories of 
eight years of martial law imposed by president ferdinand marcos 
from 197281 
about 100 communist rebels attacked a militia post on mindanao 
island killing a militiaman the military reported tuesday 
it said rebels attacked the outpost at pangatalan village before 
dawn monday near sindangan about 470 miles southeast of manila in 
zamboanga del norte province 
other rebels ambushed a detachment of soldiers sent to the 
village and a civilian was killed by a stray bullet the report 
said the rebels then fled

west virginias financial troubles have 
eaten up the funds set aside for celebrating the 125th anniversary 
of statehood this summer 
norman fagan state department of culture and history 
commissioner said his agency had saved 100000 for the party but 
before the any plans could be completed the money was taken to 
help pay the states massive backlog of bills 
well have something but it will be small and modest but 
that might be more appropriate fagan said tuesday 
the money would have been used to educate people about the 
anniversary provide grants for local governments to throw their 
own celebrations and print a special edition of a journal of west 
virginia history 
in addition fagan had hoped to have a shindig on the state 
capitol grounds this summer as well as a celebration at 
independence hall in wheeling 
instead fagan lamented were down to a tiny ceremony 
west virginia was granted statehood on june 20 1863 after 
delegates from the northwestern counties of what was then virginia 
met in wheeling and voted to join the north during the civil war 
the 100000 fell victim to the states bills which amount to 
more than 200 million and are piling higher each day 
the legislature is working on a measure that would allow gov 
arch moore to borrow 50 million to pay some of the bills as part 
of that legislation moore identified some areas where cuts in 
state spending could be made and that included the department of 
culture and history 
nevertheless fagan said the states anniversary wont go 
unnoticed every year there is a celebration at independence hall 
and fagan said this year will be no different 
its too important in our history to let it go by he said

lawyers for american telephone amp telegraph co 
argued tuesday that the company should be awarded government 
telecommunications contracts worth millions of dollars because a 
general services administration employee leaked secret atampt bid 
information to competitors 
atampt attorney c stanley dees told the gsa board of contract 
appeals that the federal agency had received information on at 
least three occasions suggesting that atampts price had been 
disclosed but gsa let the bidding proceed anyway 
gsa attorney edward gregorowicz defended the contracts to 
upgrade the federal telephone system known as fts saying there 
was no basis for atampts charges 
the real issue is that atampt has been the queen mother of the 
fts network for 25 years it got fat fell asleep and lost its 
throne gregorowicz said 
the contracts worth 55 million for 12 large electronic 
switches are being investigated by the gsas inspector generals 
office the justice department and the senate governmental affairs 
committee 
the procurement has been watched closely because gsa is also 
handling the bidding on contracts for an allnew federal phone 
system worth as much as 25 billion over 10 years 
atampt the only company to bid for all 12 switches protested 
after it won contracts for only five switches it had been the sole 
bidder for four of the five 
regional bell phone companies won contracts for the other seven 
bell atlantic bellsouth and us west each got contracts for two 
switches in their areas and pacific telesis got one 
atampt says it should get the contracts for all 12 switches 
because of the alleged gsa improprieties 
after the contracts were awarded last october atampt charged that 
gsa had misled the company during bidding and evaluated atampts bid 
differently than the regional companies proposals in an effort to 
give the contracts to companies other than atampt 
later atampt added another charge that gsa engineer sureshar l 
soni provided confidential atampt price information to bell atlantic 
bellsouth and us west 
bellsouth has offered to withdraw from its contract because its 
own internal investigation found that its bid may have been 
compromised by information passed to the company 
soni has refused to answer questions about his role in the 
procurement invoking his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in a deposition earlier this month he also 
refused to answer questions about his daughter neelam who was 
hired by bellsouth as a managertrainee last april when bids were 
being formulated 
bell atlantic and us west deny they received proprietary 
information and used it to develop their bids bell atlantic has 
said the information soni offered was of no value because he 
appeared to be restating atampts current rates which are publicly 
available 
gsa alleges that atampt also may have received confidential 
information and used it to develop its bids atampt says that when 
soni told an atampt official the companys initial bid for the 
washington dc switch was not good enough to win he was 
stating the obvious since atampt knew its initial bid did not reflect 
gsas required 10 percent discount of current prices 
gregorowicz said atampt could have raised alleged improprieties 
with the board of contract appeals during the bidding but did not 
this conduct cannot be rewarded by the board he said

a woman whose soldier husband was killed in 
the tet offensive 20 years ago this month said she has learned the 
army misplaced his body for two weeks at a time when she was told 
he was missing in action 
brenda reed sutton who has been researching a book looking at 
the vietnam war from a widows viewpoint expressed outrage and 
disbelief this week at her latest information from a chaplain in 
her husbands unit 
if theyd told me the truth my family and i would have been 
able to put this to bed a long time ago she said 
she said she wasnt told her husband had been killed until two 
weeks after the army told her he was missing in action she 
continued to write him letters sometimes as often as three times a 
day during that period 
it was a month before his body was returned home she was never 
allowed to see the body she said 
the latest information came from paul hinsky the chaplain with 
capt james eddie reeds company in the mekong delta after 
reading a feb 1 associated press story about suttons efforts to 
finally learn the hazy circumstances behind her husbands death 
hinsky and several of reeds soldiers got in touch with her 
hinsky who now lives in plainville mass said he was the 
first person to reach her husband after the attack atop an old 
french stronghold called fort courage 20 miles south of the 
former capital of south vietnam 
the chaplain assured her that he reed never knew what hit 
him and confirmed what she had heard last summer from several 
enlisted men a young american soldier who believed his short 
mortar round killed reed and three other officers went berserk that 
night and had to be shipped out 
hearing from the chaplain sutton says was quite a touching 
moment id always wondered who was the first person there then 20 
years to the day later i hear from this warm and caring chaplain 
who tells me eddie was a tremendous person and says your husband 
never suffered 
he also told sutton she said that the army screwed up they 
lost his body 
i cant imagine how they could have misplaced his body and 
then delayed telling her he was dead she said 
she continues to be stymied she said in her efforts to secure 
a copy of a reported full investigation into the fatal events of 20 
years ago 
although sutton said shes still angry over the armys handling 
of the case she said shes happy at having achieved so much in her 
attempt to reconcile herself to the death of her husband her high 
school sweetheart in kingsport tenn 
one soldier she said told her this month that eddie was the 
best officer in vietnam 
it warms my heart to know how much the men cared about him 
she said now i know that they felt pain at losing him too 
her two children including a 23yearold son who joined her on 
an emotional trip back to vietnam last fall are thrilled with 
the news that their father was mourned by his soldiers she said 
several publishers sutton said have expressed interest in her 
manuscript tentatively titled silent partner a vietnam widows 
story

three major opposition politicians were 
arrested tuesday in an apparent attempt to quiet antigovernment 
forces before the march 3 parliamentary elections 
the arrests came one day after opposition parties criticized 
president hussain muhammad ershads plan to use army troops to 
provide security for the elections which are being boycotted by a 
coalition of 21 antigovernment groups 
ershad said he would deploy troops at voting places after more 
than 100 people were killed last week during village council 
elections most of the deaths were blamed on clashes between 
supporters of rival candidates 
sajeda chowdhury secretary of the awami league and retired 
cols akbar hossain and oli ahmed leaders in the bangladesh 
nationalist party were arrested at their homes in the early hours 
tuesday representatives of both parties said 
awami league official najma rahman said mrs chowdhury had just 
returned from an awami league meeting when she was taken to dhakas 
central jail 
ashraf hussein a nationalist party official said government 
agents also carried out raids early tuesday on the residences of 
other party leaders but did not find them home 
the government made no announcement of the arrests following 
the pattern set when the oppositions main leaders sheik hasina of 
the awami league and khaleda zia of the nationalist party were 
arrested before previous elections 
mrs zia and sheik hasina were put under house arrest for a 
month after their parties led a campaign beginning in november to 
demand ershads ouster 
under emergency laws declared just after the antiershad 
campaign began police can arrest and detain people without charge 
or trial for an indefinite period more than 30 people have been 
killed in violence connected to the opposition campaign 
the awami league and nationalist party blamed ershad for failing 
to control last weeks election violence but on monday they also 
condemned his plan to employ the army for security 
the army is a sacred institution meant for safeguarding the 
countrys independence and sovereignty mrs zia said in a 
newspaper interview published tuesday they should not be dragged 
into politics 
the awami league issued a statement saying the government is 
playing with fire the decision must be withdrawn 
a source in the ruling jatiya party said monday that ershads 
decision followed an appeal from leaders of parties participating 
in the polls he spoke on condition of anonymity 
ershad a 58yearold former army general seized power in a 
bloodless coup in 1982 and was elected president in 1986 the 
opposition condemned that election as rigged and said no fair vote 
can be taken with ershad in power 
the president dissolved parliament on dec 6 and called for 
elections to try to placate the opposition but the major parties 
agreed on a boycott ershads jatiya party an alliance of 73 minor 
parties and dozens of independents are running

state and local governments businesses and 
private groups are being asked to help finance and develop more 
recreational services in federally owned national forests the 
agriculture department announced tuesday 
f dale robertson chief of the departments forest service 
said the move is in response to increasing demands for more 
recreational areas and service and to help relieve pressures on 
federal spending 
the squeezed budget is a factor robertson told a news 
conference we just cant simply do the job financing it all out 
of the federal budget 
robertson said the challenge costshare program was 
authorized by congress on a pilot basis at a level of 500000 for 
the fiscal year that began last oct 1 of that 100000 was 
earmarked for the tonto national forest near phoenix ariz with 
the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up 
by local people companies state agencies municipalities or other 
groups 
some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be 
underway this spring and summer he said restoration and 
improvement of existing facilities areas and trails are typical 
goals 
the 500000 of forest service seed money was met with 908000 
from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects 
one of the objectives of the program will be to provide more 
facilities on national forest land located near cities 
we really need to look at these urban americans and how they 
can use the national forests to meet their recreational needs 
robertson said 
what will the project mean to americans who visit national 
forests 
it will mean more camp sites more picnic areas more trails 
more opportunities for people to visit the national forests he 
said 
private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds 
marinas ski areas no increase in user fees is being proposed at 
this time but that is comething that eventually will have to be 
faced he said 
asked if the plan means opening the door for major private 
development on national forest land robertson replied 
yes we are opening that door but we also need to work with 
those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall 
scheme for recreation development 
robertson said the recreation project is patterned after a 
similar challenge grant program that congress initiated in 1986 to 
improve fish and wildlife on national forest lands 
the forest service administers 191 million acres or about 8 
percent of the us total land area although most is in the west 
the land is scattered among 156 national forests in 42 states and 
puerto rico robertson said that if all of it could be put into one 
place it would be an area 10 percent larger than texas 
robertson said the proposed budget that president reagan is 
scheduled to send congress on thursday for the 1989 fiscal year 
that will begin on oct 1 will include 3 million for the 
recreation costshare program up from the 500000 in pilot funds 
this year the one for fish and wildlife will be requested at 5 
million compared with 15 million in fiscal 1988

nobel prizewinning physicist richard 
feynman who worked on the development of the atomic bomb during 
world war ii and helped investigate the 1986 challenger space 
shuttle disaster died at age 69 
a professor of theoretical physics at the california institute 
of technology since 1950 feynman died monday night at ucla medical 
center from complications due to recurrent abdominal cancer said 
hospital spokesman rich elbaum 
in 1965 feynman shared the nobel prize in physics with julian 
s schwinger and shinichero tomonaga for developing an improved 
theory of quantum electrodynamics the three men worked 
independently in the 1940s and arrived at the same theory which 
allows scientists to predict the effects of electrically charged 
particles on each other in a radiation field 
in the death of richard feynman the world has lost one of its 
greatest intellects said lee a dubridge president emeritus of 
caltech 
marvin l goldberger director of the institute for advanced 
study in princeton nj and a former caltech president recalled 
feynman as a towering figure in 20thcentury physics who was 
always curious always modest always ebullient always willing 
to share his deep insights with students and colleagues 
feynman was a member of the atomic bomb project staff at 
princeton in 1942 and 1943 and at los alamos scientific laboratory 
in new mexico from 1943 to 1945 
during a committee investigation after the jan 28 1986 
explosion of the space shuttle challenger which killed the seven 
crew members he emerged as one of the leading critics of the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
feynman accused nasa of erratic attention to safety matters that 
he likened to playing russian roulette 
born in new york on may 11 1918 feynman graduated from the 
massachusetts institute of technology with a bachelor of science 
degree in 1939 he received a phd from princeton in 1942 
feynmans scientific interests developed early with the aid of 
his father a clothing salesman who taught him elementary 
mathematics and read his toddler son scientific studies 
i grew up with him and i knew him through many stages and he 
is just a terrific guy feynmans cousin frances lewine said 
early today 
the young scholar joined the cornell university faculty in 1945 
as an associate professor of theoretical physics and remained there 
until moving to caltech in 1950 
it was at cornell that feynman did the work that led to his 
nobel prize 
he was also a dynamic writer his 1985 autobiography surely 
youre joking mr feynman on the new york times bestseller 
list for 14 weeks demonstrated his canny humor and strong like for 
formality 
he also wrote qed the strange theory of light and matter 
an explanation of quantum electrodynamics published in 1986 and 
was coauthor of the 1963 textbook the feynman lectures on 
physics 
he was especially popular with caltech students who honored him 
for teaching excellence in 1982 
despite his stature as a professor he continued to teach 
freshman physics classes over the years and to ham it up in school 
plays once taking on the role of a bongo player in the musical 
guys and dolls 
caltech officials reported that when feynman became ill a few 
years ago students and teachers overwhelmed local medical 
facilities with offers to donate blood 
his many honors and awards included princetons albert einstein 
award the atomic energy commissions eo lawrence award the 
oersted medal for teaching the niels bohr international gold medal 
and the albert einstein college of medicines einstein award 
he is survived by his wife gweneth son carl daughter 
michelle and sister joan

the soviet union has begun dismantling 
intermediate range nuclear rockets stationed in east germany the 
staterun news agency adn reported tuesday night 
according to the report rockets stationed near neubrandenburg 
north of berlin have been dismantled crated and are ready for 
transport back to the soviet union 
under a treaty signed in washington in december by president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the superpowers 
agreed to eliminate the mediumrange missiles 
the us senate has yet to ratify the treaty 
adn said soviet soldiers are making the last preparations to 
return their ss12 rockets to the soviet union 
the rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediate range missile pact which banned weapons with a range 
from 300 to 3000 miles 
the news agency quoted a soviet officer as saying that the 
troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in 
our unit 
adn said a group of east german journalists toured the missile 
base and were allowed to interview soviet soldiers there 
east german leader erich honecker in january indicated that 
soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in east germany could 
be removed ahead of schedule but gave no specific timetable for 
their withdrawal 
the adn report did not say how many rockets were ready for 
transport back to the soviet union it also did not say if other 
missiles stationed in east germany had been dismantled or how many 
troops were scheduled to leave 
the report written by an adn correspondent described 
preparations under way to ready the rockets for transport 
cranes were used to load the dismantled rockets into transport 
containers the report said 
we were convinced that the last rockets were ready for 
transport to the location where they will be destroyed the adn 
correspondent said 
the rockets are to be sent back to the soviet union by rail the 
report said 
according to figures released after the superpower agreement was 
signed 22 rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven 
practice missiles were stationed at the site which holds the 
largest numbers of ss12s in east germany 
in all there are 54 ss12s in east germany the figures said

a defense attorney in the nazi war crimes trial 
of john demjanjuk said in closing arguments tuesday his clients 
alibi was sound and that contradictions in his testimony were due 
to memory lapses and pressure from investigators 
demjanjuk is confused about all of his movements not only 
about details of what he did during world war ii defense attorney 
yoram sheftel said tuesday the first anniversary of the trial 
demjanjuk 67 a retired ohio autoworker is accused of being 
ivan the terrible a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers 
that killed 850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in 
nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk claims that hes a victim of 
mistaken identity he has said he served in the soviet army was 
captured by the germans in 1941 and remained in prisonerofwar 
camps until 1943 
sheftel rejected prosecution charges that demjanjuk invented an 
alibi if demjanjuks testimony was contradictory in parts it 
should be attributed to memory lapses sheftel said noting that 
his client could also not remember simple facts about his family 
the accused forgot sheftel said if he made up an alibi 
he would not forget it if someone concocts an alibi you work it 
out think it out maybe write it out its very easy to do 
sheftel also claimed his client could not be expected to 
remember all events coherently because investigators pressured and 
intimidated him he said police told demjanjuk before the trial 
they would put a rope around his head 
sheftel also said israeli police deployed a ukrainianspeaking 
guard to befriend demjanjuk and elicit incriminating information 
but the effort backfired because demjanjuk stuck to his version of 
the events 
sheftel said the few details demjanjuk has provided about his 
whereabouts in world war ii mesh with testimony of historians 
called by the prosecution he also said demjanjuk couldnt have 
known the facts unless he had personally experienced them 
in one instance demjanjuk told the court he was laying railroad 
tracks after becoming a german prisoner of war sheftel said 
the attorney cited testimony by a prosecution witness who said 
the german high command at the time gave high priority to repairing 
railway tracks damaged in the crimea battle 
sheftel acknowledged that demjanjuk lied in filling out a 1948 
application for immigration to the united states by stating he was 
a polish farmer 
sheftel said demjanjuk lied because he didnt want to be 
returned to the soviet union for fear he would be executed after 
serving in an anticommunist unit at the end of the war 
the defense is to complete closing arguments this week the 
threejudge panel is expected to render a verdict in april if 
convicted demjanjuk faces a death sentence

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
tuesday the economy seems in equilibrium but that he couldnt 
make the same claim for presidential campaign rhetoric 
there is a gross distortion of reality on trade issues in 
the political debate he suggested 
greenspans comments on the economy appeared to signal that the 
fed was unlikely to move at least soon on us interest rates 
preferring to take a waitandsee approach 
there had been some speculation that the central bank was on the 
verge of lowering its discount rate the rate it charges for direct 
loans to banks and other financial institutions in an effort to 
stimulate the economy 
the discount rate has been at 6 percent since last september 
the relationships at the moment among all the major financial 
variables seem to be in relative balance greenspan said in a 
speech to the bretton woods committee a private organization that 
follows issues of international finance 
greenspans comments on politics made during a 
questionandanswer session appeared to be a dig at the 
gettough trade policies advocated by democratic presidential 
candidate rep richard gephardt of missouri 
the fed chairman was asked by a member of the audience former 
sen charles percy rill what he thought of gephardts advocacy 
of strong trade legislation during his presidential campaign 
it played well in iowa where gephardt finished first in 
last weeks democratic caucuses and it ought to play well with 
this committee percy said 
greenspan a republican who was chairman of the council of 
economic advisers under president ford replied the problem i 
have with whats going on in iowa is that there is a gross 
distortion of reality 
were greenspans remarks a direct rebuke to gephardt or more a 
comment on presidential campaign statements in general 
i dont know what he meant said joseph coyne greenspans 
spokesman 
percy later told a reporter his question to greenspan was 
facetious i dont want to see protectionism playing well in 
politics 
gephardt is the sponsor of housepassed legislation calling for 
mandatory trade retaliation against japan and other nations that 
maintain large surpluses with the united states through unfair 
trade practices 
the reagan administration has vowed a veto if the legislation 
now before a housesenate conference committee is enacted with 
such a provision which it considers overly protectionist 
a gettough policy toward trading partners has been a 
central part of gephardts campaign 
asked about interest rates greenspan said evidence of the 
most recent past was in the direction of emerging stability 
in the economy of the united states and other industrial nations 
economic variables seem to be in equilibrium and i suspect 
they will stay there greenspan said 
he said the economy appears to be weathering last octobers 
stock market plunge and that he is encouraged by recent data 
showing a narrowing of the us trade deficit 
however greenspan said prospects for buoyant economic growth 
throughout the industrial world this year are patently not 
great 
he voiced support meantime for a proposal for a 75 billion 
increase in world bank funds sought by bank president barber 
conable saying it was needed to help developing nations pursue 
sound economic policies 
conable told the conference the increase was desperately needed 
so the 151nation world lending organization could fight what he 
called an abundance of absolute poverty 
without this adjustment there is no future for many of these 
countries he said 
and treasury secretary james a baker iii told the gathering 
that winning support from congress for the us share of the 
increase which will cost the nation about 80 million a year 
would not be easy this year 
were going to be pushing it hard he said 
baker also said his 3yearold strategy for easing third world 
debt by encouraging new loans from commercial banks and tying them 
to economic reforms in the debtor nations remains the best appraoch 
proposals that would wipe out a portion of the existing debt of 
latin american and other developing countries is a path that 
would lead both debtors and creditors off the cliff baker 
contended

and ended here for rex the wandering raccoon hound 
three weeks ago he was just an ordinary stray roaming route 30 
this week hes sharing the cover of people magazine with comedian 
robin williams 
rex disappeared from arthur and emilie thomas yard in april 
1985 he was missing for 2 years until he was picked up last month 
by animal control officer cathy barrows 
rex made the dog of the week column in a local weekly and 
the thomases reclaimed him that story made the brattleboro

since his return the thomases have been swamped with calls and 
letters and some of rexs lost years are being filled in

rex after he saw a van with new jersey plates dump the hound on the 
road

the jailed mother of an abandoned girl whose 
lower legs were amputated because of severe frostbite should be 
allowed to visit her hospitalized daughter according to a hospital 
counselor 
darlwin britt who is 24 and unemployed faces charges of felony 
child neglect and is being held in the lake county jail on 50000 
bond her lawyers have said she cant pay 
a hospital staff member says however that ms britts daughter 
needs to see her mother and that a supervised visit may help the 
girl recover 
the child darlwin carlisle 9 has talked with her mother once 
by telephone but has not seen her mother since the girl was found 
last month locked in an unheated and abandoned gary apartment 
her legs were amputated below the knee after gangrene threatened 
to develop into a possibly lifethreatening infection 
it needs to be done in a planned way said mary martone the 
coordinator of the child abuse program at chicagos la rabida 
childrens hospital and research center where the girl is learning 
to walk on artifical legs 
i basically think it would be appropriate for the parent and 
child to have contact she said in a recent interview 
the childs father edward j carlisle of fort wayne and other 
relatives have visited the child hospital officials say 
others who believe ms britt should be allowed to visit her 
daughter include gary city councilman roy pratt constance 
mackward the director of the gary commission for women and jean 
thurman director of project justice and equality 
they contend the lack of support that mothers such as ms britt 
receive from the system is at least partly responsible for cases of 
child neglect and abuse 
we release condemned murderers to go to funerals said 
pratt we release hardened criminals on bail i understand 
wanting to punish the mother i was angry too until i looked at 
the side of the mother

former highway patrolman craig peyers penchant 
for long talks with young women drivers ended in murder on the 
night he met cara knott a prosecutor said in final arguments 
tuesday 
deputy district attorney joe van orshoven told a jury that 
peyers practice of pulling women over on the mercy road exit of 
interstate 15 then talking to them for an hour or more led to the 
womans death 
knott was strangled with a rope the prosecution contended 
we know that craig allen peyer had a custom a habit a 
practice van orshoven said of the traffic stops 
on dec 27 1986 when knott died something went wrong she 
wasnt like these other youngsters orshoven said 
she became anxious and scratched her assailants face orshoven 
said 
the prosecutor showed the jury a family photo of the vivacious 
knott and then three coroners photos of the dead woman with 
strangulation marks on her neck and bruises on her face 
the prosecutions witnesses included 22 women who said they had 
been pulled over by peyer at the mercy road exit and that he had 
kept them talking for an hour or more about highway safety and 
other innocuous topics none claimed that peyer made advances or 
attempted to harm her 
in his final arguments defense attorney robert grimes contended 
that some of those witnesses had lied 
peyer 37 has already been fired by the california highway 
patrol which concluded that he killed knott without justification 
he is appealing his dismissal 
knotts body was found the day after her murder below a bridge 
on a frontage road on interstate 15 the highway peyer was assigned 
to patrol the night of the killing peyer a 13year chp veteran 
was arrested 18 days later 
testimony in the trial ended feb 9 but closing arguments were 
postponed last week after a prosecutor broke a tooth at breakfast 
and was unable to deliver his summation 
the prosecutions case rest largely rests on blood samples 
microscopic fibers and testimony of witnesses about peyers 
behavior during prior traffic stops and his comments to colleagues 
fiber experts testified that microscopic fibers found on peyer 
and knott matched threads found in each others clothing a rope 
found in peyers patrol car also was said to match marks on the 
victims neck 
there was testimony that blood found on the victim matched 
peyers type but the jury was instructed to disregard that 
witnesses testified that peyer had three scratches on his face 
the night of the murder he told other officers he fell while 
pumping gas and hurt himself on a chainlink fence 
a chp officer testified that peyer once pointed out the mercy 
road offramp and noted that it would be a good place to dump a body 
peyer did not take the stand but defense witnesses have 
attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses and praised the 
veteran officers professional performance

a glittering samba parade tuesday 
highlighted rios famous carnival while in country towns ordinary 
brazilians donned humble costumes and danced in the streets 
police used clubs and tear gas to break up a rock fight among 
spectators leaving the samba school parade three people were 
arrested and two hospitalized with injuries a police spokesman 
said 
a celebrant who may have been offended by the sexual tone of a 
television networks coverage of gala balls punched an anchorman

nato needs to decide what new shortrange 
nuclear weapons to build in view of the treaty eliminating 
mediumrange atomic missiles from europe senate democratic leaders 
said tuesday 
i dont think there is a clear consensus in the alliance about 
just exactly where we go from here said sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the armed services committee 
i do think there is a consensus for the modernization of 
shortrange nuclear weapons but there is no agreement yet on 
specifically which weapons to build he said 
nunn and majority leader robert byrd dwva were among a 
group of key senators who visited us allies in europe last week 
as part of the senates consideration of the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty negotiated two months ago by president regan 
and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the treaty would eliminate mediumrange missiles on both sides 
but would allow both the north atlantic treaty organization and the 
warsaw pact to build nuclear weapons with a range of less than 300 
miles 
byrd told reporters that european leaders told the senators 
that the inf treaty should be approved without amendments and 
that following that nato should procede with modernizing those 
groundbased nuclear weapons that are eligible under the treaty 
the general consensus was that the allies should not go for 
the third zero option said byrd referring to calls from some 
european politicians for the total elimination of nuclear weapons 
they should plan to improve the range of those shortrange 
theater weapons that would be allowed and not emphasize the 
modernization of shortrange artillerytype weapons said byrd 
but nunn at the reopening of hearings by his committee on the 
treaty said nato needs to decide specifically what type of 
shortrange weapons to build 
the options include nucleartipped artillery shells which have 
a range of 15 or 20 miles and longerrange weapons such as the 
lance missile 
in 1983 nato ministers agreed to build a new generation of 
shortrange weapons but that decision has not been implemented 
the reagan administration has urged nato to improve its 
nonnuclear weapons to offset soviet numerical advantages in 
conventional weapons the alliance has long relied on the 
possibility of using nuclear weapons to deter a soviet attack 
edward l rowny one of reagans top arms control advisers told 
nunns committee tuesday that soviet officials have frankly 
admitted to me that the cutting edge of their political and 
military power lies in their conventional forces 
they may be attempting to mesmerize the west with nuclear 
reductions while protecting the utility of their conventional 
superiority rowny said 
another witness ronald lehman who helped negotiate the inf 
pact noted that a substantial number of us nuclear weapons 
will remain in europe after the inf treaty 
but nato has never had a politically easy time when it built 
new nuclear weapons lehman said 
undoubtedly the soviet union hopes that a new arms control 
agreement will have a soporific effect on western security concerns 
which will weapon natos defenses he said 
retired army gen bernard rogers former supreme alllied 
commander told the foreign relations committee that nato should 
build a number of new shortrange atomic weapons 
they include an airtoground missile new artillery shells and 
an updated version of the lance rogers said 
he also urged approval of what he said are lowcost steps 
nato could take including a comprehensive arms control strategy 
zbigniew brzezinski national security adviser under president 
carter told the armed services committee it would be a mistake 
to go along with efforts to negotiate for the elimination of all 
nuclear weapons 
meantime sen alan cranston dcalif said the democratic 
leadership will go ahead and offer an amendment proposed by sen 
joseph biden ddel that would require the administration to 
adhere to the view of the treaty outlined by administration 
witnesses 
biden recently underwent surgery and is not expected to return 
to work before the treaty comes up for a vote cranston said 
the proposal stems from an ongoing dispute between the 
administration and congressional democrats over how to interepret 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty democrats want a 
narrow or restrictive interpretation while the 
administration has said it has the right to move to a broad 
interpretation that would allow tests of reagans star wars 
antimissile program 
secretary of state george shultz recently wrote nunn and byrd 
that administration witnesses are speaking authoritatively meaning 
that some future administration wont be able to change its view of 
the what the treaty means

president francois mitterrand announced tuesday he 
will attend the nato summit meeting next month making him the 
first french chief of state to do so since france left the 
alliances military wing in 1966 
the summit to be held march 23 in brussels is very 
important because it will define the politics of disarmament 
for members of the north atlantic treaty allaince mitterrand said 
on french television 
i must be there and there again i must represent france and 
france must speak with one voice he said 
mitterrand a socialist and conservative premier jacques chirac 
have attended summit meetings together since chiracs conservative 
coalition came to power in march 1986 
in a television interview tuesday night within hours of 
mitterrands announcement chirac said he naturally would 
attend also but added i dont believe this summit is very 
important 
no french president has assisted at a nato summit since 1966 
when france under president charles de gaulle withdrew from the 
alliances military wing to assure the independence of its own 
nuclear force 
mitterrand also confirmed he will not reveal whether he will be 
a candidate in presidential elections in april until sometime after 
the nato summit politicians who have met with him have said he 
would make his decision known in early march 
mitterrand who holds a steady lead in the polls has been 
widely criticized for leaving the electorate in doubt 
someone mitterrand said must guard the state since chirac 
is campaigning for the presidency 
referring to the recent european economic community summit and 
the upcoming nato summit mitterrand said he risked losing his 
authority if he were not running and risked becoming too involved 
in political debate if he were 
all internal political debate must come after these two 
events he said

minnesota attorney general hubert h humphrey iii son of the 
late vice president announced thursday he will seek the democratic 
nomination for the us senate seat now held by republican david 
durenberger 
former vice president walter mondale who served with humphreys 
father in the senate looked on in the capitol rotunda as the 
45yearold attorney general launched his campaign with an attack 
on durenbergers priorities 
meanwhile in florida us rep dan mica said he will challenge 
popular former gov reubin askew in seeking the democratic 
nomination to replace threeterm sen lawton chiles who is 
retiring 
humphrey who has led minnesotas top law office for six years 
and served in the state senate for 10 years before that said he is 
campaigning on his own record not that of his father who died in 
1978 and was briefly succeeded by his widow muriel 
my fathers accomplishments with my mothers help are 
unparalleled in this century humphrey said 
humphrey said he could never take his fathers place 
but i know i can take mr durenbergers he said 
he charged durenberger elected in 1982 had failed his 
constituents 
his priorities have been star wars contra aid judge robert 
bork cutting social security slashing medicare and turning his 
back on the deficit said humphrey 
leon oistad durenbergers campaign manager said humphreys 
announcement speech was riddled with distortions about 
durenbergers record 
humphrey faces an uphill battle in his bid to unseat 
durenberger lagging behind the incumbent in both fundraising and 
the polls the latest poll conducted last month by the st paul 
pioneer press dispatch wccotv and wcco radio showed durenberger 
leading humphrey by 51 percent to 38 percent 
oistad said durenberger has not decided when he will officially 
enter the race 
the only other announced candidate is polly mann 67 a 
cofounder of women against military madness running as an 
independent 
mica a 44yearold former school teacher and fifthterm 
congressman dismissed sentiment among some democrats that there 
should be no challenge to askew in the race for the florida senate 
seat 
if youve read the papers it looks like a handful of 
political kingmakers are trying to say well select the 
candidate only one person should run he said 
ive got news for them there are 12 million people in this 
state who will have a voice 
mica has had a high profile in congress in foreign policy and as 
chairman of the subcommittee on foreign operations which last year 
took him to moscow to look into concerns about security at the us 
embassy 
he has been a supporter of president reagans central america 
policy but this month voted against the contra aid package saying 
the peace process should be given some time 
initial statewide polls have indicated he runs 6to1 behind 
askew mica says he can catch up by midsummer 
on the republican side us rep connie mack iii is the only 
declared candidate 
on monday pennsylvania republican sen john heinz iii announced 
he will seek a third term 
heinz 49 kicked off his campaign with a twoday series of 
stops former philadelphia city controller joseph vignola filed 
petitions to enter the april 26 primary for the democratic 
nomination to oppose heinz greatgrandson of the founder of the

three historians have criticized a new play that 
equates soviet founder vladimir i lenin with his successor 
dictator josef v stalin and provides a negative picture of 70 
years of soviet history 
the criticism of the mikhail shatrovs play onward onward 
onward was contained in a halfpage article published tuesday 
in the communist party newspaper pravda 
the play was published in december and is to be performed this 
spring in moscow shatrov a leading writer has used the greater 
artistic freedom of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms to produce plays 
on historical subjects that previously could not be touched by 
soviet artists 
a play published last spring reviewed lenins decision to pull 
revolutionary russia out of world war i against the advice of many 
of his supporters 
the new work takes the form of a debate among bolsheviks and 
their opponents looking back over 70 years of soviet history at the 
1917 revolution that brought communists to power 
the historians g gerasimenko o obichkin and b popov 
accused shatrov of using lenin as a conduit for his own ideas and 
treats the bolshevik revolution as an accident instead of the 
historical certainty that soviet theorists claim it was 
they said shatrovs play equates stalin and lenin echoing those 
who claim that the methods of stalin are identical to those of 
lenin that stalin starts his roots from lenins epoch thus the 
author unequivocally gives a negative description not of stalin 
alone but the whole period of the socialist construction of this 
country they said 
pravda has criticized the play briefly before but the lengthy 
article monday was the most detailed and serious rejoinder 
in shatrovs play stalin is made to answer for the purges in 
which millions died by his former comrades who also became his 
victims but in one scene lenin says that he is to blame for not 
making sure before his death in 1924 that stalin never would be 
able to take supreme power 
the plan ends with only stalin and lenin on stage shatrov 
expresses the wish that stalin would leave the stage but he 
remains

a somber nation marked the 1000th day of captivity 
tuesday of journalist jeanpaul kauffmann but neither french nor 
iranian officials offered much hope that the hostage would leave 
lebanon soon 
marathon runners carried a large chain to symbolize kauffmanns 
captivity during a 1000kilometer trek from brittany in northwest 
france to a barge on the seine where politicians and loved ones 
called for kauffmanns release 
it is important that the captors know that all of france is 
united his wife joelle 
i came here to express my solidarity said human rights 
minister claude malhuret 
the newspaper guild of america the praguebased international 
organization of journalists and the journalists committee for the 
liberation of french hostages in lebanon all issued statements 
appealing for the freeing of kauffmann and other captives 
the education ministry asked that the statement by the french 
group be read in classrooms 
but the name of another hostage middle east researcher michel 
seurat abducted with kauffmann on may 22 1985 was barely 
utteredthe shitte moslem group islamic jihad which claimed the 
abductions announced march 5 1986 that seurat had been executed 
seurats wife mary asked that his name no longer be mentioned 
in nightly newscasts that count off the hostages days of captivity 
we would like even more to be close to them to tell them to 
hold on that nothing will be neglected and nothing is president 
francois mitterrand said on television 
but it is so hard so difficult in the face of this pitiless 
act to arrange that jeanpaul kauffmann and our other frenchmen 
held hostage be freed one day 
kauffmann 43 a reporter for the newsweekly evenement du jeudi 
and seurat were taken hostage as they drove from the beirut airport 
following kauffmanns arrival 
two other french hostages diplomats marcel carton 64 and 
marcel fontaine 45 kidnapped march 22 1985 have passed their 
1000th days as captives 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longest held of the 22 foreign hostages in 
lebanon he was captured march 16 1985 
six french hostages most of them held by the organization of 
revolutionary justice have been freed since conservative premier 
jacques chirac came to power in march 1986 
in each case france thanked iran which has influence over the 
groups holding westerners captive 
iranian vice minister ali reza moayeri in a french television 
interview tuesday said that iran was not to be counted on for the 
freeing of more hostages 
iran benefits from a very important influence in lebanon 
that can be used to free western hostages including french but at 
a time when we have satisfying relations with france moayeri 
said 
for the moment diplomatic relations being broken between our 
two countries no move in favor of the hostages can be undertaken 
france severed relations with iran on july 17 after a dispute 
over an embassy employee who refused to submit to questioning about 
a series of bombings in paris 
never would we have imagined seeing the 1000 days said 
kauffmanns mother odette i never thought myself capable of 
facing such a test

a conrail engineer who ran a stop signal and 
caused an amtrak crash that killed 16 people pleaded guilty to one 
count of manslaughter tuesday in a bargain that will bring him no 
worse than five years in jail and a 1000 fine 
rick l gates 33 who was scheduled to begin a trial on 16 
counts of manslaughter by locomotive was operating the three 
linked conrail engines jan 4 1987 when they skidded in front of 
an amtrak passenger train carrying 660 people the worst accident 
in amtraks history left 16 dead and more than 170 injured 
gates was granted the guilty verdict after attorneys agreed to 
include in the single misdemeanor count the names of all 16 
fatalities prosecutors reserved the right to ask for the maximum 
sentence of five years and 1000 
baltimore county circuit judge joseph f murphy set sentencing 
for march 29 gates remained free on 11500 bail 
despite the admission by gates and brakeman edward cromwell that 
they smoked marijuana in the cab prosecutors said expert witnesses 
were unable to render an opinion regarding impairment blood 
and urine samples showed that both men tested positive for 
marijuana 
this is the firstever manslaughter by locomotive verdict 
said sandra oconnor baltimore county states attorney and the 
chief prosecutor this will send a message that operators 
cannot work under the kind of negligence that mr gates did 
but prosecutors she said were not certain the judge would have 
sentenced gates if convicted to 16 consecutive fiveyear terms 
mrs oconnor said one reason she decided to accept the plea 
agreement was the recent federal appeals court ruling against 
automatic postaccident drug testing for all railroad workers 
families of victims survivors and friends filled the small 
courtroom some crying and others shaking their heads while a 
prosecutor read a 42page statement of facts detailing the crash 
and actions by gates and cromwell 
after the hearing gates told reporters outside the courthouse 
i am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence 
i cant begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families i am 
sorry 
the sentence is woefully inadequate said arthur johnson a 
founder of safe travel america whose daughter christy was killed 
in the crash 
i am grossly disappointed that he can cause tens of millions 
of dollars in damage and kill 16 people and still face only five 
years on a misdemeanor charge said dr roger horn whose 
16yearold daughter ceres was killed 
cromwell who was not charged was granted immunity from 
prosecution and was scheduled to testify against gates 
the statement agreed to by both sides blamed gates for missing 
two track signals and allowing the locomotives to skid through a 
switch where four tracks converge to two about 600 yards before the 
gunpowder river bridge crossing 
the statement revealed that gates lied to the national 
transportation safety board about the track signals and about his 
and cromwells drug use on the train 
according to the statement the first signal 17 miles from the 
switch indicated that the conrail engines should slow down and stop 
before crossing onto the amtrak track gates had insisted the 
signal told him to proceed 
the statement blamed gates for failing to replace a cab warning 
light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over either warning 
device would have alerted gates to the stop signals the statement 
said 
the statement also reported that cromwell said he and gates had 
smoked part of a marijuana cigarette in the cab shortly after 
leaving baltimore 
following the crash cromwell ran back to the conrail engines to 
get his marijuana pipe which he then discarded in the yard of a 
nearby home the statement said he left the scene while gates 
stayed to help the rescue effort the statement said 
gates and cromwell met at cromwells home on jan 6 the night 
before they met with ntsb investigators and agreed to a version of 
the events that would not incriminate either of them

defense secretary george younger said tuesday that 
a refusal by west germany to continue deploying shortrange nuclear 
missiles would leave a gaping hole in natos ability to back up 
conventional forces with a nuclear threat 
younger also said he hoped nato will make decisions as early as 
this spring on modernizing nuclear forces following the superpower 
agreement to withdraw their landbased mediumrange missiles from 
europe 
i think they west germany will talk about it a lot raise it 
a lot but not actually press it because it would leave a 
gaping hole in flexible response younger said speaking at a 
lunch for american reporters 
nato flexible response strategy calls for the use of nuclear 
weapons starting with the shortest range if conventional forces 
are being overrun 
the superpower agreement has provoked a furious argument in west 
germany about whether to modernize or even maintain missiles with 
ranges up to 300 miles after the superpower agreement 
west germany the east blocs closest neighbor sees itself as 
being left uniquely vulnerable to nuclear attack both as the main 
depository of shortrange missiles and the only western ally within 
range of similar soviet missiles 
by far greater danger faced by us and by germany is the huge 
conventional imbalance those thousands of soviet tanks which 
are ready to roll across the north german plains said younger 
on modernizing remaining nuclear forces younger said he hoped 
decisions could be made at natos military planning group meeting 
in april but this might not be possible until the autumn 
we shall be in a position to decide as soon as we see the 
proposals said younger 
he said that if nato lowers its guard now the soviets will 
never agree to the proposed halving of superpower longrange 
missiles or do deals on chemical and conventional weapons 
his remarks reflected the british view that the united states 
should not negotiate with moscow on eliminating shortrange 
missiles unless there is agreement to ban chemical weapons and cut 
soviet superiority in conventional armaments 
asked about a recent suggestion by us defense secretary frank 
carlucci that the united states might withdraw troops from europe 
if west germany rejected nuclear missiles younger said any 
american troop withdrawal would send the wrong signal 
it was vital he said to nato cohesion that nobody doubted 
americas commitment to the belief that the defense of the 
western free world starts in europe

the cabinet on tuesday approved an ordinance that 
will give government employees a taste of the fiveday workweek 
beginning in april about 11 million public sector workers will 
alternate between the new system and the old one of sixday 
workweeks said katsunari miyoshi of the management and 
coordination agency 
the new system will give workers two fiveday weeks and two 
sixday weeks each month 
the cabinet move came more than six years after the fiveday 
system was started on a trial basis in november 1981 miyoshi said 
japans trading partners including the united states have 
called for shorter working hours for japanese workers increased 
leisure time translates into greater spending which helps boost 
japans domestic consumption and correct its trade imbalances 
in the private sector 509 percent of japanese companies with a 
workforce of 30 or more currently operate on a fiveday workweek 
according to a labor ministry survey

eleven companies conspired in a 
bidrigging scheme that inflated the price of lunchroom milk by at 
least 10 million over a decade an antitrust lawsuit charged 
tuesday 
the ultimate effect of the conspiracy was to take coins from 
the pockets of floridas school children we find that to be 
shameful said florida attorney general robert butterworth 
holding up empty halfpint milk cartons similar to those sold in 
schools 
the federal civil suit filed in miami by the attorney generals 
office represents the largest antitrust action ever taken against 
the milk industry and may be as farreaching as the highway 
bidrigging scandals that rocked some states in the late 1970s 
butterworth said 
the investigation butterworth said could result in criminal 
charges in florida and may spread to other states as well 
the suit was filed against seven major milk producers and four 
florida distributors alleging that highlevel officials of the 
companies established production levels divided the florida market 
among themselves and fixed an inflated price on halfpint cartons 
of milk over the past 10 years 
company spokesmen had little to say about the allegations on 
tuesday 
the attorney general said the overcharges exceeded at least 10 
million because his office estimated the price of each carton was 
inflated by more than 1 penny more than 1 billion cartons were 
sold during the 10year period 
butterworth said the state is seeking more than 30 million from 
the companies or three times the amount of the alleged 
overcharges if the state is awarded damages the money will be 
distributed to the public school boards in 32 florida counties that 
bought the milk and resold it to students he said 
dairy processors named in the suit were southland corp velda 
farms of dallas borden inc of columbus ohio flavorich inc of 
louisville ky dean foods products co of chicago pet inc of 
st louis mo kraft sealtest of chicago and harts dairy dean 
foods of fort myers fla 
distributors named in the suit were marshall simmons enterprise 
of mango pierson distributors inc of opa locka hampt distributors 
inc of homestead and butler foods of naples all four are in 
florida 
we understand that the florida attorney general has filed a 
lawsuit we have not been served with a copy of the suit said 
william fischer financial vice president of dean foods 
we are aware the investigation has been going on in florida 
and that a number of our employees have been subpoenaed over the 
past few months other than that we really dont have anything 
else to add fischer said 
scott horne a media relations assistant for kraft was not 
immediately available for comment his secretary said 
borden spokesman chris tilton said the company had not seen a 
copy of the lawsuit and had no comment 
there was no immediate comment from other milk producers 
contacted the four florida distributors referred telephone calls 
to the companies whose products they distribute 
these companies went to extraordinary lengths to conceal their 
conspiracy from government officials butterworth said the 
scope and design of the conspiracy made it almost impossible for an 
individual school district to detect it 
butterworth said the attorney generals office has been feeding 
data from florida school boards into a computer for analysis for 
the past two years he declined to say what prompted the 
investigation 
the lawsuit alleged the conspiracy involved florida counties 
south of ocala and mostly affected the dade broward and 
hillsborough school districts the 32 counties buy about 1718 
million cartons of milk a year at an annual cost of 257 million

accusing management of unionbusting tactics 
2500 tugboat workers and other marine employees went on strike 
against nine companies tuesday the walkout had little effect on 
the flow of goods through new york harbor officials said 
my understanding from this morning is that boats were being 
loaded said stephen berger executive director of the port 
authority of new york and new jersey 
no problems said gregory storey of the new york shipping 
association an umbrella group for deep sea shipping companies 
albert cornette president of local 333 of the international 
longshoremens association said his 2500 members unanimously 
rejected the companies demands for the elimination of 750 jobs and 
for wage and benefit givebacks 
they have been telling our people well bust you what does 
that mean asked cornette they said they would take a strike 
rather than renew or negotiate our contracts 
negotiations were suspended monday and no further meetings were 
scheduled cornette said 
police established a temporary base on staten island near seven 
of the companies which have hired temporary replacements for the 
strikers 
five firms have locked the workers out and four have not come to 
terms cornette said he said the union has signed with nine other 
companies and 10 others have unexpired contracts 
officials of the marinetowing companies refused to comment 
salaries for local 333 members range from 385 a day for 
captains to 175 a day for deckhands based on a 12hour day with 
overtime cornette said he said members wages average about 
35000 a year

an experimental drug for treatment of one of 
the main lifethreatening infections associated with aids was 
approved for wider use tuesday 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen said 
trimetrexate has been moved into the treatment investigational 
new drug category for treatment of certain pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia patients 
however because the drug has potentially lethal sideeffects it 
must be used in conjunction with another drug called leucovorin 
that mitigates those effects 
under food and drug administrations conditions accompanying 
approval for wider use of trimetrexate it is to be distributed to 
patients who have shown a severe adverse reaction to the two drugs 
already on the market for treating pneumocystis carinii 
elaine baldwin a spokeswoman for the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases said that means trimetrexate is 
likely to be available to about 300 patients nationwide 
she said it will be made available free to patients who qualify 
with niaid a branch of the national institutes of health and 
the manufacturer warnerlambert co of morris plains nj 
handling distribution and bearing the cost 
despite the existence of two powerful drugs to treat the rare 
form of pneumonia scientists involved in clinical trials have been 
interested in the possibility that trimetrexate may prove less 
toxic for some patients when it is used in conjunction with 
leucovorin 
this treatment ind will allow us to offer an important 
treatment alternative to severely ill patients who cannot tolerate 
the standard therapy said niaid director anthony s fauci 
under the socalled treatment ind category drug developers and 
researchers can make promising experimental drugs available to 
patients with immediately lifethreatening diseases before the 
drugs have passed full safety and efficacy review by the fda 
that makes it more widely available to certain patients but 
under more carefully controlled conditions than when a drug wins 
approval for general marketing 
bowen made the announcement at the start of a twoday seminar 
sponsored jointly by the fda and american medical association to 
familiarize health professions with the new treatment ind rules 
that went into effect late last year 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring

annual starting point for the governments dryseason offensives 
against rebel strongholds in the southeast

the aflcio on tuesday condemned 
israels use of excessive force against palestinian civilians 
on the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip its firstever 
rebuke of israel 
the condemnation was issued by the 143millionmember labor 
federations executive council an hour after meeting with secretary 
of state george shultz shultz is scheduled to make a weeklong 
visit to the middle east feb 24 to promote new negotiations 
between israel and jordan on palestinian selfrule 
the aflcio blamed islamic fundamentalists for fueling the 
flames of violence in the occupied territories but said the 
palestinian demonstrations did not warrant unnecessary force used 
by israeli defense forces 
no doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience 
of the israeli army in riot control and other police functions and 
to the frustrations of israeli soldiers as they confront young 
palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs the federation 
said these factors may explain but they cannot excuse and the 
aflcio cannot condone the use of excessive force against 
civilians 
the federation however rejected what it called a notion that 
israel must now redeem itself by turning the west bank and gaza 
strip over to the palestine liberation organization more than 50 
palestinians have been killed and thousands of others have been 
injured or arrested by israeli forces in the occupied territories 
since early december 
rex hardesty a spokesman for the labor federation said it is 
the first time the aflcio has made any criticism of an israeli 
action they havent crushed childrens hands before he said 
the annual winter meeting of the labor leaders here was shultzs 
last stop of an extended weekend in southern florida to gain 
support from traditional friends of israel for his effort to soften 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs opposition to entering new 
peace negotiations 
shultz addressed a meeting of the bnai brith antidefamation 
league in palm beach on friday seeking help from the us jewish 
community in pressing shamir to show more flexibility 
theres been so much emphasis on the process direct 
negotiations on the one hand an international conference or some 
kind of international vehicle on the other that the discussion 
has become a little sterile he said tuesday if we are going 
to get going we need to talk a little bit more about the substance 
of what might happen

mayor andrew young apologized tuesday to local 
ministers for remarks last week about presidential candidates pat 
robertson and jesse jackson which were interpreted as being 
critical of preachers 
young speaking last week to a group of student journalists 
said i dont think you can go directly from the pulpit to the 
presidency though young was specifically critical of robertson 
a former television evangelist in his speech he also extended his 
remarks to include black preachers of which jackson is one 
young himself an ordained congregationalist minister told 
black clergymen tuesday his remarks were intended to be 
tongueincheek 
i consider myself a preacher young said i in no way 
intended or suggested that there was anything involved in the 
ministry of the gospel that should be taken lightly i think i was 
guilty of making a tongueincheek statement that i think the 
audience understood and implied no disrespect 
suggesting that robertson and jackson lack the experience to be 
president young told the students if youre a preacher you 
talk for a living so even if you dont make sense you learn to 
make nonsense eloquently 
not that black preachers are different from white preachers 
but black preachers start out not intending to make sense he

the reagan administration said tuesday it has 
begun an investigation into allegations that the government of 
south korea has unfairly restricted us cigarette sales in its 
markets 
the korean cigarette market is approximately 21 billion a 
year and is totally controlled by government monopoly us 
trade representative clayton yeutter said in a statement announcing 
the investigation 
the inquiry could lead to retaliatory tariffs against south 
korean products if the government finds that the korean 
restrictions constitute an unfair trading practice 
the government action came on a petition filed last month by the 
us cigarette export association which contends that korean 
barriers are causing us firms to lose 500 million annually in 
potential exports 
in his statement yeutter said the industry petition raises 
questions about whether policies of the korean government restrict 
us companies from open and nondiscriminatory access to the 
korean cigarette market 
during the investigation the united states will make 
additional efforts to resolve this issue with the korean 
government yeutter said noting that the petition had been 
accepted following extensive consultations between the two 
governments over the past two years aimed at achieving open and 
nondiscriminatory market access 
earlier this month the us government stripped dutyfree 
import treatment from products from south korea and three other 
asian exporters hong kong taiwan and singapore 
the united states last year ran a 71 billion trade deficit 
with south korea 
in a related move the american meat institute on tuesday filed 
a petition protesting a south korean ban on the import of 
highquality beef claiming the ban is costing it 5 million a 
year the government has 45 days to act on the petition

politician and popular film star vijaya kumaranatunga was gunned 
down by suspected sinhalese extremists at his home another person 
injured in the gunfire later died in the hospital 
police said they did not know if the two attacks were related

bombing of a ship intended to carry palestinians on a protest 
voyage to israel 
abu nidals dissident plo group known for terrorist attacks 
also vowed revenge 
two of the bodies of mohammed sultan and mohammed buheis were 
flown to amman jordan for burial 
the palestine liberation organization has blamed israeli secret 
service mossad for the killings sunday and the explosion monday 
on the ferry sol phryne both in limassol the ferry was holed 
below the waterline 
cyprus condemned both attacks but made no accusations and said 
an investigation was being conducted to determine whether the 
events were related 
a plo statement issued in nicosia said israel knows that the 
plo is not handcuffed the blood of our martyrs will not go 
unavenged 
sultan buheis and the third guerrilla marwan kayyali were 
killed in a car bombing in limassol on the southern coast 
they apparently were attacked after arranging the sale of the 
sol phryne to a ploaffiliated company for the ship of return 
voyage to israel with 130 palestinians who have been expelled from 
israelioccupied arab territories the trip originally was to have 
begun at piraeus greece 
in athens plo spokesman bassam abu sharif said the three men 
were not linked to the voyage 
we deny completely any relationship between the three who were 
assassinated by the israelis two days ago in limassol and the 
journey of return he told reporters we deny any relationship 
between the three martyrs and chartering the boat we deny also 
that the ship was bought by the three men 
he said they were on a different mission 
we are continuing our plans and we will sail in spite of 
israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas noble 
ideas abu sharif said 
cleanthis vlahopoulos captain of the ferry said several 
months would be needed to make the sol phryne seaworthy again 
in lebanon a statement by the abu nidal group pledged to avenge 
the guerrillas deaths with double swift retaliation 
abu nidal whose real name is sabry albanna has been blamed 
for terrorist attacks around the world since splitting from yasser 
arafats mainstream fatah guerrillas in the early 1970s he is 
wanted in europe and the united states 
a senior plo official in nicosia said the slain guerrillas were 
not members of abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council but they 
were popular active and wellrespected officers with whom abu 
nidal had worked before he split from fatah 
also in lebanon a group calling itself islamic jihad squads in 
palestine said it would kill prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
israel agriculture minister ariel sharon as a price for this 
crime the threat was contained in a statement delivered to a 
western news agency in beirut 
a man claiming to speak for the usbased jewish defense league 
said monday it was responsible for the attack on the 6151ton sol 
phryne 
the jdl is responsible for the bombing at limassol he told 
the associated press in nicosia by telephone this is only a 
warning next time we will bomb it with all the people on it 
the head of the jewish defense league irv rubin told the 
associated press in a telephone interview monday from los angeles 
that the bombing was a righteous action but his organization 
was not involved 
shamir has said the voyage would be considered a declaration 
of war and israel would stop it in the ways it sees suitable 
israels transport minister chaim corfu appeared to suggest on 
tuesday that his government was behind the bombing 
if the plo obtains another vessel its fate will be the 
same he said on israel radio we knew we wouldnt allow the 
boat to reach israel if we could prevent its departure that was 
obviously the right thing to do

the nations armed forces are running short of 
a critical spare part uniforms 
the situation has gotten so bad according to a new survey that 
the marine corps is issuing ious for coats to enlisted men and 
women 
moreover the navy is reducing its supplies of peacoats and blue 
jumpers at military exchanges to clothe recruits graduating from 
boot camp the air force has reduced from two to one the number of 
blue service coats issued to many recruits and the army is running 
out of coats shortsleeve shirts field caps and trousers 
as the newspaper navy times stated tuesday the naked truth is 
that the military is running out of uniforms 
the independent newspaper said it had surveyed the four services 
and found agreement that the shortage could be traced to the 
defense personnel support center in philadelphia that center has 
been wracked over the past year by a kickback scandal involving a 
handful of clothing companies and some defense department employees 
recovering from the indictments is our major problem said 
paul zebrowski the deputy director of the centers clothing and 
textile directorate 
it became impossible to do business with those companies and 
even before our production base was very small 
the marine corps appears to be the hardest hit the newspaper 
said with dwindling stocks of all three types of its uniform coats 
a recent directive instructed marine boot camps to issue one 
complete green uniform to recruits along with an appropriate due 
member certificate iou for the coats not issued 
clothing stores also have been told to stop selling dress blue 
marine coats except to those individuals in receipt of orders 
where the blue uniform is required for the performance of duty 
the directive added 
in the navy men and women already in the fleet are finding 
reduced selections of uniforms at exchanges when they need to

a group of american scientists on tuesday 
disputed reagan administration statements that it was not practical 
to verify the dismantlement of nuclear warheads under an arms 
control agreement 
members of the federation of american scientists outlined at a 
news conference a dismantlement plan worked out earlier this month 
in conjunction with the committee of soviet scientists against the 
nuclear threat headed by roald sagdayev head of the soviet 
civilian space agency 
jeremy j stone president of the us group and members frank 
von hippel and theodore b taylor said they were concerned that 
defense secretary frank carlucci may have raised misconceptions 
in defending the intermediaterange nuclear forces pact the pact 
calls for the elimination of all mediumrange us and soviet 
missiles 
carlucci and other administration officials defending the 
treaty against conservative sen jesse helms rnc said it did 
not require the destruction of warheads from the banned missiles 
because verifying that step could expose secrets on how the devices 
are built 
the administration further argued that destroying the warheads 
would free up weaponsgrade plutonium which could be used by 
terrorists and officials said the soviets could simply produce 
more weapons material to replace any destroyed 
although stone taylor and von hippel support the inf pact they 
took issue with carlucci and proposed a system under which 
warheads could be dismantled and the material either used in 
reactors or buried underground 
under the plan the soviet union and united states would each 
designate a dismantlement site which would be closely monitored to 
prevent the clandestine entry or exit of nuclear material said 
taylor who worked in the national laboratory at los alamos in 
194956 designing nuclear weapons 
nuclear warheads entering the site would be tagged for 
identification and fingerprinted by neutron probes xrays or 
gamma rays which the scientists said would verify that the devices 
contained nuclear materials but would not disclose their inner 
workings 
the warheads would then be dismantled behind closed doors at the 
nation which owned them and inspectors from the other nation would 
verify that nuclear material had left the site 
in the case of american warheads soviet inspectors would 
only have to verify that a batch of nuclear warheads had entered a 
us dismantlement facility and that after all the warheads had 
been dismantled and their components destroyed beyond recognition 
no intact nuclear warheads remained inside the scientists said in 
a statement 
taylor and von hippel recommended that weaponsgrade plutonium 
from the warheads be mixed with radioactive wastes and buried 
they recommended that highly enriched uranium also used in 
nuclear weapons be used to fuel reactors for electric power plants 
the estimated cost of dismantling the warheads about 6 billion 
would be dwarfed by the value of the fuel about 50 billion they 
said 
taylor said in a paper that the approximately 1000 tons of 
u235 enriched uranium and 200 tons of plutonium in the worlds 
more than 50000 nuclear warheads could be consumed as fuel in all 
us and soviet nuclear power plants in seven years or in all the 
worlds nuclear power plants in about three years 
von hippel acknowledged that the scientists had not devised a 
foolproof plan to enable each side to be assured that the correct 
type and number of warheads were being dismantled under an arms 
control agreement involving multiple systems

a permit that would have allowed japanese 
salmon fishermen to accidentally catch seals killer whales and 
other mammals violated an animalprotection law a federal appeals 
court ruled tuesday 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld a preliminary 
injunction issued by a federal district judge last june that halted 
gillnet fishing for salmon by japanese fleets in the bering sea off 
alaska 
in a 21 decision a threejudge panel rejected an appeal by the 
federation of japan fisheries cooperative association to overturn 
the preliminary injunction issued by us district judge norma 
holloway johnson 
the injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a 
native alaskan fishermans organization to stop the accidental 
taking of sea lions fur seals white porpoises and killer whales 
that could be ensnared in the ninemilelong gillnets 
as issued by the secretary of commerce the threeyear permit 
would have allowed the japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5250 
dalls porpoises in the northern pacific ocean including 789 in 
the bering sea 
the court ruled that the permit which allowed the japanese 
fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took 
violated the marine mammal protection act 
the interest in maintaining healthy populations of marine 
mammals comes first and the secretary cannot ignore the fur seals 
he can include the northern fur seals in the permit only if he 
makes the requisite findings the court said in an opinion by 
judge gerhard gesell 
lacking such findings the permit cannot issue moreover he 
may not allow the federation merely to pay the price for taking 
protected marine mammals and he must face up the taking of other 
marime mammals the record shows will inevitably occur if gillnet 
fishing is permitted gesell said in the opinion joined by judge 
ruth b ginsburg 
judge kenneth starr filed a dissent saying the majority 
decision is unsupported by the text structure or legislative 
history of the statute 
the injunction was obtained by the center for environmental 
education and the kokechik fishermens association

israels deputy chief of staff said tuesday 
some soldiers had committed totally unacceptable acts against 
palestinians and hospital officials reported eight arabs wounded 
by troops in the west bank 
maj gen ehud barak also said more than 200 israelis had been 
injured most of them lightly since arab riots began dec 8 in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip he said 53 palestinians had been 
killed but the united nations puts the number at 54 
barak and defense minister yitzhak rabin confirmed that some 
soldiers used a bulldozer to bury four palestinians alive near 
nablus in the west bank the general declared this pattern of 
behavior is totally unacceptable under the standards of the 
israeli defense forces and any civilized norms whoever is found 
responsible for this event will be punished 
neighbors rescued the four arabs shortly after they were buried 
young palestinians set fire to a bus tuesday burned tires and 
built road blocks in the occupied territories and arab east 
jerusalem where a general strike virtually closed down arab 
communities and neighborhoods 
riot police stopped a bus carrying israeli arab high school 
students from school in haifa to their homes in umm al fahm and 
beat several of them the daily newspaper al hamishmar reported 
an official at umm al fahm confirmed the report to the 
associated press police declined comment 
transport minister chaim corfu appeared to suggest israel bombed 
a ferry that was to carry arab deportees from a cyprus port to 
israel if the palestine liberation organization obtained another 
vessel he said its fate will be the same 
we knew we wouldnt allow the boat to reach israel he said 
on israel radio if we could prevent its departure that was 
obviously the right thing to do 
in the west bank a soldier punched and shoved an israeli 
cameraman working for nbc news 
the soldier said he asked the cameraman ofir moradov to stop 
filming a protest but nbc correspondent martin fletcher said 
moradov did not hear the request the army said the soldier was 
convicted of unbecoming conduct but would not reveal his name 
or the sentence 
barak said soldiers had not choice but to use beatings in an 
attempt to curb the riots 
whatever amount of force is needed is something that in my 
judgment is forced upon us by the situation he told a news 
conference of foreign reporters 
we cant easily put the realities of life into a simple set of 
orders the situation created during the control of a violent riot 
is much more complicated than it might seem 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said on a visit to italy we 
want to put an end to the riots and restore normal life on the 
other hand we dont want to kill people i hope in the near 
weeks we will find the most right methods 
we have to handle it in the most human limitations he said 
addressing a news conference in english we have to defend 
ourselves and at the same time continue our efforts for finding 
peace 
rabin questioned about the beating policy during debate in 
parliament said the orders to use force were necessary and to 
the best of my knowledge and judgment are legal 
he said the burial of the arabs at nablus will be treated with 
the full heaviness of the law its not imaginable that such an 
incident would happen in the israeli army 
barak said the army is succeeding in gradually improving the 
caliber of behavior of our forces but added we are 
confronting a new type of threat we cannot afford to yield to it 
and we are not going to 
he said protesters are led by a nucleus of activists who enjoy 
the support and cooperation of the masses 
the organization is on the local sometimes regional level 
he said and the core consists of two or three thousand 
relatively young people 
the general who directed military intelligence in 198386 said 
he sees no quick end to the disturbances he attributed the riots 
to decades of frustration on the personal economic and political 
levels not outside incitement 
five people were wounded by gunfire and 12 injured by rubber 
bullets or beatings at the fawwar refugee camp where about 4000 
palestinians live near hebron in the west bank said officials at 
hebrons alia hospital one described the wounds as moderate to 
light 
israel radio said a riot started tuesday evening and residents 
stoned israeli soldiers who fired several shots and wounded one 
protester the military command said it was checking the reports 
in kabatiyeh a west bank village 35 miles north of jerusalem 
soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters and wounded two young 
arabs in the legs the arabrun palestine press service reported 
it said another palestinian was wounded during a protest in nearby 
jenin 
doctors at jenin hospital confirmed treating three men for 
gunshot wounds 
army officials reported a protester wounded at kabatiyeh after 
he tried to wrest a gun from a soldier but said they had no 
information about other shootings

chancellor franz vranitzky said tuesday 
his coalition will survive a split over president kurt waldheims 
conduct in world war ii but the issue is isolating austria from 
the rest of the world 
the socialist chancellor in coalition with a conservative party 
that supported waldheim for the presidency also repeated his 
threat to resign if the waldheim affair is not resolved 
waldheim said he will sue der spiegel a west german magazine 
that printed a copy of a document purportedly linking him to 
deportation of civilians in the balkans where he was a lieutenant 
in the german army the magazine has retracted the story and said 
the document probably was a fake 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher said britain will 
reopen the files on six commandos taken prisoner in 1944 on the 
germanoccupied greek island of alimnia 
we have taken the allegations concerning dr waldheim very 
seriously particularly those concerning british servicemen she 
told the house of commons in a written reply to a question 
an international commission of historians that investigated 
waldheims past said in its report that it could not prove a 
connection between him and the commandos but found the initial 
w on transcripts of interviews with the six men the report 
suggested that waldheim knew the gestapo shot captured commandos 
after meeting with deputy chancellor alois mock head of the 
conservative peoples party vranitzky told reporters we have 
clearly affirmed the intention to have this government continue 
his statement seemed designed to quell speculation that 
divisions over waldheim might dissolve the coalition 
the chancellor runs the government and the presidency is largely 
ceremonial the socialists are the senior partner in the coalition 
with the peoples party which backed the former un 
secretarygeneral for president in 1986 
vranitzky criticized waldheim for what he called failure to take 
a clear stand on key points of the report by the commission of 
historians the 202page document said waldheim was in close 
proximity to nazi atrocities must have known about them and did 
nothing to stop them 
in a televised speech monday the president said he would not 
resign and asked austrians to unite behind him 
mock one of waldheims staunchest backers said tuesday the 
presidents speech offered dialogue and said clearly he is 
conscious of his integral role 
but vranitzky repeated his threat to resign saying he can only 
lead in good conscience if the working conditions are such to 
allow me to assume these obligations in a responsible way 
vranitzky also voiced concern about the impact of the affair on 
austrias tourism economy and its relations with other western 
countries 
major us travel operators are flying americans to budapest 
rather than vienna he said adding our business people cannot 
be easy about that 
referring to austrian efforts to establish closer trade links 
with the european community vranitzky noted we cant be 
indifferent to the fact that in the whole year 1987 only two 
government leaders visited us 
the soviet and liechtenstein premiers were in austria last year 
what i really think is necessary for everybody in this country 
and therefore also for the president is to try to emerge from 
this isolation out of this selfchosen inner emigration 
vranitzky said 
waldheim spokesman gerold christian said it was unclear exactly 
on what charges waldheim planned to sue der spiegel under austrian 
law the president must instruct state prosecutors to begin any 
legal proceedings on his behalf 
der spiegel published in its feb 1 edition a copy of a telegram 
allegedly linking waldheim to the deportation of more than 4000 
civilians from the kozara region in yugoslavia in 1942 
a copy of the document was sold to der spiegel by a yugoslav 
journalist the original could not be found der spiegel in its 
current issue apologized for publishing what was most probably a 
fake 
in may waldheim instructed state prosecutors to sue world 
jewish congress president edgar bronfman for asserting that 
waldheim was part and parcel of the nazi killing machine 
late last year waldheim ordered prosecutors to sue the austrian 
magazine wiener which published a supplement on the waldheim 
affair 
a poll conducted for the conservative vienna daily die presse 
reflected rising public pressure for waldheim to resign the 
telephone poll was based on interviews with 440 austrians 
fortysix percent of those who responded were against 
resignation and 37 were in favor two weeks ago a similar poll 
said 72 percent of those surveyed opposed waldheims resignation 
fortyfive percent of those polled said they wouldnt vote for 
waldheim if an election were held on sunday while 34 percent said 
they would

police and civilian auxiliary officers 
patrolled near churches a historic cemetery and in the center of 
this baltic capital tuesday preventing demonstrations to mark 
lithuanias brief independence 
jadvyga beliauskiene a roman catholic activist told reporters 
shortly before midnight monday that four lithuanian nationalists 
were under house arrest to stop them from leading protests 
a high profile by police showing a harder line by soviet 
authorities against expressions of baltic nationalism seemed to 
deter any largescale showing of national feeling 
western reporters brought to vilnius by the soviet foreign 
ministry for a governmentapproved visit were followed constantly 
in cars and on foot as they visited lithuanian activists and 
traveled through winding medieval streets to visit sites where 
protests had been scheduled 
ms beliauskiene a former member of an anticommunist partisan 
movement in the 1940s who spent 12 years in prison was one of 
about 200 people who signed a petition to soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in january asking that authorities not terrorize 
people who wanted to celebrate lithuanian independence

of independence from soviet russia months after the bolshevik 
revolution brought the communists to power lithuania was 
independent until it was absorbed by the soviet union in 1940 
in moscow the officials soviet news agency tass said us 
ambassador jack matlock on tuesday declined to receive official 
representatives of the lithuanian soviet socialist republic who 
came to protest us interference in the republics internal 
affairs 
thirtytwo us senators have written to gorbachev asking him 
not to interfere with this weeks demonstrations and religious 
services in the soviet republics of lithuania and estonia 
the statecontrolled soviet news media has criticized similar 
congressional statements in the past for inciting public 
demonstrations in the baltic republics 
 
activists called on citizens to pray at two vilnius churches and 
lay flowers at a monument to polishlithuanian writer adam 
mickiewicz and the grave of jonas basanavicius a doctor and 
champion of the lithuanian language who died 61 years ago on feb 
16 1927 
the monument to mickiewicz was the scene of a demonstration on 
aug 23 marking the anniversary of the 1939 germansoviet 
nonaggression pact that consigned most of lithuania to soviet 
control 
we want to raise the consciousness of people so they remember 
they have the right to be free said ms beliauskiene 59 who 
works as a file clerk in a government aids laboratory 
witnesses said one woman was led away by police after she laid 
flowers at the monument to mickiewicz on tuesday evening but they 
said she apparently was not arrested 
nijole sadunaite a roman catholic activist who spent six years 
in prison and exile for her role in distributing religious 
literature met reporters monday night in the stairwell of an 
apartment house guarded by uniformed and plainclothes police 
a uniformed officer told reporters that if they entered the 
apartment they would be responsible for anything that happened to 
ms sadunaite 49 
ms sadunaite said kgb agents had attacked her ripping the 
buttons from her coat and punching her in the stomach she said her 
only goal was to honor the memory of the dear lithuanian people 
who died for our independence 
we dont use tanks we dont use machine guns we dont even 
use profanity she said nervously even if they strike us we 
do not strike back 
kaunas lithuanias secondlargest city also appeared quiet 
mayor petras staskunas told western reporters who visited the 
city that dissident reports that nationalists had been injured in a 
scuffle with police on sunday were not true 
there were no incidents in kaunas on sunday we know these 
emigre organizations want things to happen here but nothing has 
happened he said we know there are extremists in this city 
we wont hide it but they have no influence or support 
at the rasu cemetery in the snowcovered hills near the center 
of vilnius at least 18 policemen in gray coats and fur hats and 
auxiliary policemen wearing red armbands stood near the black 
granite pillar that marks the grave of basanavicius 
bouquets of tulips and a lily had been placed on the grave and a 
solitary candle flickered in the chilly morning breeze but there 
were no protesters 
one of the two auxiliary policemen guarding the graveyards 
whitewashed stone gate said were here to keep up order 
asked why so many police were deployed on the streets and at the 
historic sites a member of the vilnius soviets or local 
government said we have a saying in lithuanian one drop of tar 
will spoil the whole jar of honey

an american who was the first member of the irish 
republican army to be extradited from the united states was 
convicted tuesday of gunning down a london policeman in a 
coldblooded killing untinged by any remorse 
william quinn a san francisco native was sentenced to life in 
prison by judge christopher rose after a jury returned the guilty 
verdict at the old bailey criminal court 
quinn who pleaded innocent to killing offduty officer stephen 
tibble 21 in february 1975 refused to say anything during his 
fiveday trial and showed no emotion as the verdict was read 
he lost a widely publicized fiveyear battle against 
extradition that went all the way to the us supreme court 
rose told quinn the shooting was an appalling coldblooded 
killing untinged by any remorse on your part and motivated no 
doubt by the terrorist activities on which at that time you were 
engaged 
you shot repeatedly and at pointblank range a man who was in 
fact a police officer though you could not have known he was other 
than an ordinary member of the public the judge said 
carlene rohan quinns us lawyer who testified for the 
defense said quinn would not have been convicted in the united 
states 
the evidence of identification would not have been permitted 
there she said 
his mother juanita attended the trial but had no comment on 
its outcome 
the judge accepted a defense plea not to set a mandatory minimum 
sentence which could free quinn in 10 or 15 years 
quinn who is of irish ancestry was living in san francisco 
when he became an ira supporter and made trips to ireland in 1971 
and 1974 court testimony indicated prosecutors alleged that he 
and four other men were sent to mainland britain to carry out a 
string of bomb attacks 
a man identified as quinn was leaving a house in west london on 
feb 26 1975 when two police officers on a burglary patrol became 
suspicous and stopped him for questioning 
quinn fled but was confronted by tibble who was off duty and 
driving by on motorcycle when he stopped to assist the other 
officers prosecutors charged that quinn fired two shots into 
tibbles chest with a handgun 
quinn was arrested in ireland on suspicion of belonging to the 
outlawed ira police meanwhile arrested quinnss accomplices 
located the murder weapon and found a bombmaking operation in a 
house near where the slaying occurred quinns fingerprints were 
found on a road map and other items 
quinn fled to san francisco but was arrested in 1981 by the fbi 
on a british warrant setting in motion a protracted legal battle 
that culminated in early 1986 when a us appeals court ruled 21 
in favor of his extradition 
he was extradited in october 1986 after the us supreme court 
refused to hear his argument that the police shooting was a 
political offense and therefore not covered by the usbritish 
extradition treaty

richard p feynman the brilliant 
mischievous physicist who called his nobel prize a pain in the 
neck and helped shatter nasas claim that cold weather didnt 
doom the shuttle challenger has died of cancer at the age of 69 
the theoretical physicist who also helped develop the atomic 
bomb during the manhattan project of world war ii died monday 
night at ucla medical center after an eightyear battle with 
abdominal cancer said hospital spokesman rich elbaum said 
the california institute of technology professor was noted for 
his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles his provocative 
mischievousness his indignant impatience with pretension and 
hypocrisy and his talent for oneupping anybody who tries to 
oneup him al hibbs a former student and nasa scientist said 
in the introduction to the bestselling 1985 autobiography surely 
youre joking mr feynman 
it was certainly in character for feynman to conduct an 
impromptu experiment as a member of the presidential commission 
that investigated the jan 28 1986 explosion of the shuttle 
challenger in which all seven crew members died 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
initially played down any possibility that cold weather impaired 
the resiliency of oring seals on the shuttles booster rockets 
thus allowing burning fuel to erode through the rings to cause the 
fatal blast 
but at a recess during the comissions hearings in february 
1986 feynman showed oring resiliency was sharply reduced by cold 
he compressed a piece of rubberlike oring material with a simple 
clamp dropped it into a glass of ice water pulled it out and 
released the oring piece demonstrating that it lacked any 
resiliency for a few seconds 
i believe this has some significance for our problem he 
said 
the commission agreed in its final report concluding floridas 
prelaunch freeze contributed to an oring failure that caused the 
accident 
feynman also wrote an appendix to the commissions final report 
accusing nasa of playing russian roulette with the shuttle fleet 
and astronauts lives and of exaggerating the rockets safety to 
the point of fantasy 
born in new york city on may 11 1918 feynman started learning 
mathematics while still in his high chair he earned a degree from 
the massachusetts institute of technology in 1939 then earned a 
doctorate at princeton university in 1942 after working on the 
manhattan project he moved in 1945 to cornell university where he 
did his nobelwinning studies then moved to caltech in pasadena in 
1950 
in 1965 feynman shared the nobel prize in physics with julian 
s schwinger and shinichero tomonaga for developing an improved 
theory of quantum electrodynamics the theory allowed scientists to 
predict the effects of electrically charged particles on each other 
in a radiation field 
the truth was i didnt really want this prize feynman said 
in his autobiography explaining how the recognition disrupted his 
privacy and his life 
its nice that i got some money i was able to buy a beach 
house but altogether i think it would have been much nicer not 
to have had the prize because you never any longer can be taken 
straightforwardly in any public situation he wrote in a way 
the nobel prize has been something of a pain in the neck 
feynman often refused to explain his prizewinning work once 
declaring hell if i could explain it to the average person it 
wouldnt have been worth the nobel prize 
cornell university professor hans bethe a former colleague 
there and on the manhattan project called feynman the greatest 
theoretical physicist in the united states after world war ii 
feynman was not an ordinary genius he was a magician said 
bethe who himself received the nobel prize for physics in 1967 
nobody could have done what he did 
marvin goldberger director of the institute for advanced study 
in princeton nj and a former caltech president called feynman 
a towering figure in 20th century physics who was always 
curious always modest always ebullient always willing to share 
his deep insights with students and colleagues 
yet feynman took pleasure in promoting his image as a funloving 
man who enjoyed outings to las vegas where show girls were all 
beautiful and i just love beautiful girls 
in his book feynman also told how he demonstrated inadequate 
security at los alamos national laboratory by learning to pick 
locks on file cabinets containing the nations abomb secrets 
which didnt amuse his superiors on the topsecret manhattan 
project 
feynman was especially popular with caltech students who 
honored him for teaching excellence in 1982 he continued to teach 
freshman physics classes and to ham it up in school plays once 
taking on the role of a bongo player and appearing in the musical 
guys and dolls 
caltech officials reported that when feynman became ill a few 
years ago students and teachers overwhelmed local medical 
facilities with offers to donate blood 
feynman is survived by his second wife gweneth and two 
children 
private funeral services for feynman will be held later this 
week and will not be announced a public memorial service remains 
to be scheduled a caltech spokesman said

movies is paying off big this week as three disney movies rank 
among the top five at the box office 
good morning vietnam was the biggest pull at the box office 
over the weekend for a fifth consecutive week while the disney 
film shoot to kill debuted at no 2 and the studios hit 
three men and a baby held on for fourth 
it was disneys best showing ever 
it isnt a record however thirteen months ago paramount was 
the reigning champ with three films at the top of the weekly box 
office list golden child star trek iv and crocodile 
dundee 
the three current disney films have kept turnstiles spinning 
with a total take so far of 200 million studio spokesman dick 
cook said tuesday adding its really a matter of having good 
pictures weve been very lucky

business are often brief 
this business runs in cycles were all just very pleased 
cook senior vice president of the disneytouchstone distribution 
arm buena vista pictures we feel good about whats happening and 
will try to keep it going 
john krier of exhibiter relations co which charts the weekly 
movie box office performance said the studio shouldnt be so 
modest 
when they take three out of the top four thats pretty darn 
good krier said 
the studio cinderella story got its start in 1984 when the 
disney movie division was floundering and it started touchstone 
films shortly afterward michael eisner a paramount executive 
when that studio enjoyed such hits as raiders of the lost ark 
became as chairman and chief executive officer of disney 
touchstones first release was the mermaid comedy splash a 
steady stream of hits followed including down and out in beverly 
hills ruthless people color of money and outrageous 
fortune 
disney also has a penchant for releasing old reliable animated 
features this winters reissue of cinderella added 335 
million to studio coffers and it gave disney its best winter season 
ever

movies perform extremely well cook said and we have very high 
expectations for our films in spring and summer

the hound and return to snowy river before heading into its

five newspaper unions dropped their opposition 
tuesday to the proposed partial merger of two detroit newspapers 
saying joint operation is the only way to assure the survival 
of the detroit free press 
in briefs filed with the justice department the unions urged 
attorney general edwin meese iii to approve the agreement 
the detroit news and the detroit free press have requested 
permission to merge their advertising circulation and production 
departments and to enter into a profitsharing agreement under a 
law designed to protect newspaper competition when one of the 
publications is in danger of going out of business the newspapers 
would retain separate news and editorial departments 
justice department spokesman mark sheehan said he expected meese 
to act as promptly as he can on the proposed agreement 
a justice department administrative law judge morton needelman 
in december upheld a recommendation by the departments antitrust 
division that the proposed joint operating agreement be disapproved 
directors of knightridder inc owner of the free press 
countered by stating their intent to close the 156yearold 
newspaper if meese fails to approve the joa 
attorneys for knightridder and for gannett co inc owner of 
the news argued in january that the boards decision introduced a 
new element into the case that made it imperative that meese 
approve the agreement 
the antitrust division in a brief filed tuesday argued that 
evidence in the case showed that knightridder at the time the 
newspapers announced their application of the joint operating 
agreement in 1986 was willing to continue subsidizing the free 
press 
whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the 
newspaper preservation act should properly be determined as of 
the time it enters into a joa agreement not on the basis of 
decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval 
under the statute the division said 
the division also asserted that needelman was correct in arguing 
that the news had not attained a clearly dominant position in 
detroit market and therefore the free press was not a failing 
newspaper 
the unions dropping their opposition to the merger were detroit 
typographical union no 18 newspaper drivers and handlers local 
372 graphic communication international union local 289m detroit 
mailers local no 2040 and detroit newspaper printing and graphic 
communications union local 13n they represent employees at both 
newspapers 
the unions said the decision by knightridder directors and 
evidence in the case led us to conclude after very careful 
consideration that the free press is in probable danger of 
financial failure within the meaning of the newspaper preservation 
act 
we have further concluded that the joa is the only way to 
assure the survival of the free press and the preservation of two 
independent editorial voices in detroit the unions said 
one union remained opposed to the partial merger the newspaper 
guild local 22 representing editorial employees vote 34984 
monday night to continue opposition to the joa 
guild officials bargained and then voted without knowing that 
the other unions had reversed their opposition to the joa said 
donald kummer administrative officer of the guilds local 22 
unless we can resolve the problems that have existed since 
this thing was announced i dont see any change in my position 
he said 
the newspapers asserted that union opposition had been based on 
the premise that a joa would mean a loss of 600 to 1000 jobs at 
the newspapers 
the unions now clearly understand that the status quo will not 
be maintained if the joa is denied but rather the free press will 
close and all 2200 jobs at the free press will be lost the 
newspapers said 
the news and the free press have long been locked in a battle 
for newspaper dominance in detroit the news which is the larger 
newspaper has lost 75 million since 1979 and the free press has 
lost 100 million according to knightridder

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev criticized 
britain and other western european countries tuesday for what he 
called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to 
eliminate intermediaterange missiles 
gorbachev met with foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe of 
britain who defended britains nuclear policy at a news conference 
in the soviet capital 
while generally approving the inf treaty the leaders of nato 
countries have been acting as though the situation in europe since 
its signing had only worsened gorbachev said according to a 
report by the official tass news agency 
otherwise it was impossible to explain the latest wave of 
praise for the nuclear deterence strategy plans for socalled 
compensation all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of 
newest weapons the francowest german military rapprochment and 
so forth gorbachev said 
the soviet leader also said britain had grown less enthusiastic 
about a chemical weapons ban and that the west was dragging its 
feet at a conference in vienna to work out a format for new talks 
on conventional forces in europe 
gorbachev soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov and other 
soviet officials regularly have criticized european leaders after 
the dec 8 superpower summit for urging the modernization of their 
weapons systems to make up for the loss of us pershing 2 and 
cruise missiles in europe 
in east germany the official news agency adn reported tuesday 
that the soviets had begun dismantling intermediate nuclear 
missiles 
howe at a news conference after his meeting with gorbachev 
defended britains policy of keeping and modernizing its nuclear 
force 
peace has indeed been upheld in the past 40 years by the 
nuclear deterrent howe said the deterent resoures available 
need to be kept up to date to be modernized 
modernization is not a euphemism for circumventing the inf 
treaty he added 
gorbachev and president reagan signed an agreement in december 
to eliminate their medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles from 
europe as well as the rest of the globe the two sides now are 
trying to negotiate a 50 percent cut in their arsenals of 
longrange weapons 
the ussoviet agreement is awaiting us senate approval in 
the soviet union the treaty has been approved by the ruling 
communist party and must be passed by the supreme soviet which is 
expected to give its endorsement

exwife and gerald rush who live in the same town but in a 
different mobile home park six miles from the shooting scene 
pasco county sheriff jim gillum said boggs visited the colony 
hills mobile home park in zephyrhills looking for a resident with

boggs broke into harold rushs mobile home with a shotgun and 
handgun and started shooting gillum said a single blast killed 
nigel maeras 70 and injured her daughter betsy ritchie 50 and

his former wife on his return to ohio its very possible he 
thought he killed them gillum said

monday after florida authorities issued a warrant for his arrest

it was a one in a million case of mistaken identity gillum

the soviet union has begun dismantling part of its 
intermediate range nuclear arsenal in east germany the staterun 
news agency adn reported tuesday 
the step makes an important contribution toward disarmament 
even before a ussoviet treaty to eliminate the mediumrange 
missiles is ratified adn said 
according to the report rockets stationed near neubrandenburg 
north of berlin have been dismantled crated and are ready for 
transport back to the soviet union 
adn did not say how many had been dismantled or when the rockets 
will be transported back to the soviet union east german 
television late tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto 
transport vehicles 
the disarmament treaty was signed in washington in december by 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev but the 
us senate has yet to ratify it the supreme soviet is expected to 
approve it 
under the agreement the soviets shorterrange missiles in east 
germany and in czechoslovakia are to be destroyed within 18 months 
and longerrange us and soviet missiles within three years 
in washington there was no immediate reaction at the state 
department but a us official said the soviets were free to 
dismantle the missiles before the treaty took effect 
the official who demanded anonymity said us inspectors will 
go to east germany and all other soviet missile sites to verify the 
soviets were complying with the treaty 
west german government officials tuesday night declined comment 
on the report 
there was no immediate comment in moscow but gorbachev on 
tuesday criticized western european countries for what he called a 
lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to eliminate 
intermediaterange missiles 
in a report by the official tass news agency gorbachev 
criticized western european governments for the latest wave of 
praise for the nuclear deterrence strategy all manner of 
projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons the 
francowest german military rapprochment and so forth 
adn said soviet soldiers are making the last preparations to 
return their ss12 rockets to the soviet union 
the rockets are shorterrange weapons included in the 
intermediate range missile pact which banned weapons with a range 
from 300 to 3000 miles 
the news agency quoted a soviet officer as saying that the 
troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in 
our unit 
adn said a group of east german journalists toured the missile 
base and were allowed to interview soviet soldiers there 
the adn report described preparations under way to ready the 
rockets for transport cranes were used to load the dismantled 
rockets into transpot containers it said 
we were convinced that the last rockets were ready for 
transport to the location where they will be destroyed adn said 
the rockets are to be sent back to the soviet union by rail the 
report said 
east german leader erich honecker in january indicated that 
soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in east germany could 
be removed ahead of schedule but gave no specific timetable for 
their withdrawal 
the adn report did not say if other missiles stationed in east 
germany had been dismantled or how many troops were scheduled to 
leave 
according to figures released after the superpower agreement was 
signed 22 rockets 12 launchers nine transport vehicles and seven 
practice missiles were stationed at the site which holds the

caspar weinberger the former defense 
secretary questioned tuesday whether fundamental policy changes 
are taking place in the soviet union and whether mikhail gorbachev 
can keep his post as top leader 
i think we have to be very careful if we assume there are 
major policy changes weinberger said i dont know how 
firmly seated is the present regime i dont think any of us really 
know that 
im not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary 
of the communist party of the soviet union who is very different 
from the past weinberger told the washington foreign 
correspondents association 
soviet forces in afghanistan suggest that things are not all 
that changed in the soviet union weinberger said i dont see 
any change in world domination as their goal 
it should take two weeks or four at the outside for the 
soviets to withdraw troops from afghanistan he said despite their 
current talk of a 10month timetable 
the sincerity of gorbachevs offer can only be judged when 
withdrawal is complete when theyve left and the afghan 
people can have the kind of government they want he said 
weinberger who was succeeded by defense secetary frank carlucci 
late last year described as surface changes the new look at 
the kremlin gorbachev smiles from time to time he wears much 
better clothes and hes younger and apparently in better health 
than past leaders he said 
the principal change i see in the soviet union is that they 
are now actively courting world public opinion campaigning for a 
favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are 
getting it he said

jorgensen 58 of norway served with the united nations relief and 
works agency which cares for palestinian refugees they were

green line to the moslem sector where he held an hourlong meeting 
with sunni moslem acting prime minister salim hoss at his home

worrying case 
im indeed hopeful goulding said i cant say that the

lobbyists for specialinterest political 
action committees believe many members of congress give them scant 
attention unless they make campaign contributions a group that 
advocates campaign finance reform said tuesday 
a survey of 50 pac directors and lobbyists found the pacs see 
themselves as victims in a campaign system that forces them to 
trade contributions for access to lawmakers who decide issues of 
importance to the unions businesses and other interest groups the 
pacs represent 
one pac director told of seeing a little black book in which 
a congressman kept the names of contributors and referred to it 
when a lobbyist sought a hearing with him 
the individual said members of congress have told him well i 
like your organization but you havent given me a contribution 
the interviews with the pac officials were conducted by the 
center for responsive politics a political research organization 
that is critical of pac influence in politics 
the group said the pac officials agreed to talk on condition 
their names would not be used in the report among the pacs 
represented were some of the largest such as the 5 
millionperelection american medical association pac and the 
smaller pacs that give less than 50000 in total contributions to 
candidates 
the groups report said the pac officials freely admitted they 
contributed to congress members to ensure access some expect not 
only a meeting but a sympathetic ear 
one was quoted as saying that a lot of people think a pac 
gives you access well you can get access without a pac what i am 
saying is sympathetic access 
the pac officials also acknowledged the frequent practice of 
giving overwhelmingly to incumbents during a campaign and then if 
the incumbent loses helping the winner to retire a debt in order 
to establish influence with the new legislator 
pacs said they felt they were manipulated by members of 
congress who constantly apply pressure for money the pacs we 
talked to said they felt unrelenting pressure to attend 
fundraisers that they were unfairly being held responsible for 
skyrocketing campaign costs and that the public held them in low 
repute the centers report said 
when a member who has received a pacs donation votes against 
that pacs interest it doesnt sit well the report said 
in one case we gave to a member thinking that we would get 
something and it didnt work well never give to that member 
again one pac director was quoted as saying 
some 4000 pacs are registered with the federal election 
commission they represent a spectrum of special interests from 
environmental and foreign policy concerns to farm corporate labor 
and guncontrol interests 
election law limits each pac to a maximum 5000 contribution to 
any one candidate in contrast to the limit for individual 
contributions of 1000 
congress has yet to approve any of the legislative options it 
has had under consideration for some time to restrict the role of 
pacs in elections by putting a ceiling on how much in total pac 
money any one candidate could accept or eliminate the need for 
pacs by instituting public financing for congressional campaigns

opponents in parliament lost a final bid tuesday 
night to water down a conservative government bill restricting the 
promotion of homosexuality 
the amendment sought to limit to teaching in schools a blanket 
stipulation that local government authorities must not 
intentionally promote homosexuality 
the house of lords the nonelected upper chamber of parliament 
defeated the amendment 9048 meaning the bill is virtually certain 
to become law by june 1 
a labor party member lord longford charged that the bill 
which has already passed its key legislative stages in the elected 
house of commons with large majorities smacked of a general 
queerbashing campaign 
government home office minister lord caithness retorted that 
gay pride programs and the promotion of gay rights in youth 
clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize 
homosexuality 
young people are susceptible to these intolerable 
influences said lord caithness 
activities such as a lesbian gay strength and pride week are 
in the governments view at least as likely to glamorize 
homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as 
anything a teacher might do he said 
the house of lords can delay and suggest changes to legislation 
but cannot overturn bills approved by the house of commons 
critics charge the bill will heighten hostility toward 
homosexuals and reflects prejudices of prime minister margaret 
thatcher she complained last fall that children were being taught 
they have an inalienable right to be gay 
critics say the word promote is so vague it could mean local 
authorities censoring the works of famed homosexual writers such as 
oscar wilde 
local authorities run public libraries some theaters and most 
state schools 
the government has denied prejudice but accused some leftwing 
local authorities of using state funds to promote homosexuality as 
an acceptable way of life 
under the proposed law complainants could bring a civil suit 
against local authorities and auditors could also penalize them for 
misusing funds 
in wording gay rights groups said was particularly offensive 
the measure stipulated that local authorities must not promote 
the teaching in any maintained state school of the acceptability 
of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship 
homosexuality between consenting adults has been legal in 
britain since 1967 
leftwing councils including those running inner city london 
boroughs and the northern cities of manchester and sheffield are 
derided by conservative newspapers for grants to gay and lesbian 
community groups

the aging n reactor shut down amid safety 
concerns prompted by the soviet nuclear accident at chernobyl will 
be placed in indefinite cold standby the energy department 
said tuesday 
the decision means that the reactor which for 25 years has 
produced plutonium for the nations nuclear arsenal will be 
mothballed next year after the completion and testing of 100 
million in safety improvements 
lawmakers said congress is expected to go along with the 
decision which is included in president reagans proposed spending 
plan for the next fiscal year the budget is to be presented to 
congress on thursday 
about 2600 workers will eventually lose their jobs at the 
reactor located at the hanford nuclear reservation in central 
washington state 
sen dan evans rwash said that the ripple effect from those 
layoffs could eventually result in a total of up to 7000 people 
loosing their jobs in the tricities spokane yakima and the 
seattle area 
energy secretary john herrington said the decision to close the 
reactor was a result of a review of the nations future need for 
plutonium conducted by the department of defense 
under cold standby status fuel will be removed from the 
reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued the doe 
said 
the reactor could be cranked up if the demand for plutonium 
increases but a restart could take up to three years to complete 
the n reactor has been a key part of our national security 
complex for more than 20 years and those who have been associated 
with it can be proud of its contribution to the security of the 
united states herrington said in a statement 
herrington said doe was committed to a sensitive orderly 
transition it is the goal of the department to do everything 
possible to assist those people who will now need to find new 
jobs 
the n reactor is one of four doerun reactors that produce 
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons the other three located 
at the savannah river complex near aiken sc are running at 50 
percent power because of safety concerns 
the n reactor was shut down in january 1987 for safety 
improvements prompted by the nuclear accident at chernobyl in the 
soviet union the n reactor is similar in design to that soviet 
reactor although us officials said it was considerably safer it 
is operated for the energy department by westinghouse inc 
the announcement ends months of speculation about the future of 
the n reactor the decision was reached following meetings that 
involved herrington defense secretary frank carlucci james 
miller director of the office of management and the budget and 
white house chief of staff howard baker 
as recently as december doe officials had told congress that 
the reactor would probably be restarted this spring 
but herrington said it was decided that plutonium produced by 
the three savannah river reactors along with the recycling of 
plutonium from retired nuclear weapons could meet demand 
evans and morrison who blamed budget cuts for the decision 
said they were disappointed but they said at least the 
department would finish the safety improvements and not shut the 
reactor immediately layoffs would thus come gradually 
if there is any good news in this and there isnt much that 
is it evans said 
both evans and morrison said they would push for expanded 
funding for the cleanup of highly radioactive defense waste at the 
hanford reservation and also for the conversion of a mothballed 
washington public power supply system nuclear plant at the hanford 
reservation into a new defense production reactor

bob dole who came from behind only to 
fall back in the final week of the presidential primary campaign 
sought tuesday to put a positive face on his secondplace finish 
it looks like vice president george bush may have won so 
weve made up a lot of ground here in the last few days the 
senate minority leader said 
its been as ive said for some time a twoperson race 
weve made a lot of progress the last few days we didnt quite 
pull it off here but we feel pretty good about it dole said in 
an interview 
earlier dole blamed unfair attacks for the results 
if it hadnt been for the distortion of my positions on tax 
increases and an oil import fee id be 10 points ahead he said 
you shouldnt distort someones record i could do that to 
him but i wont he pledged however to straighten out my 
record its not going to take long 
dole won convincingly in the first major test of the season 
beating bush 21 in last weeks iowa caucuses 
polls before the caucuses showed dole trailing bush by as much 
as 20 percentage points in new hampshire but dole came on strong 
to make the race a virtual deadheat as the voting began 
dole was upbeat early tuesday 
it feels good like it did in iowa last monday he said 
bush with a home just outside new hampshire on the maine coast 
had long considered new hampshire friendly territory just as iowa 
was seen as home turf for dole who is from neighboring kansas 
dole also benefited from president reagans comparatively low 
popularity among republicans in iowa and suffered from reagans 
strength in new hampshire where reagan beat thenrival bush 21 in 
the 1980 gop primary 
the fact the vice president moves out of new hampshire with 35 
percent of the vote in a state which has 2 percent unemployment a 
state in which ronald reagan is 82 percent popular i dont 
think that bodes well for what will happen for bush down south 
said sen warren rudman doles most prominent new hampshire backer

you sensed it was over when ted williams and 
barry goldwater stepped into the batters box 
new hampshire which derailed george bushs big mo in 1980 
delivered for him in tuesdays republican presidential primary the 
results dealt a serious setback to bob dole but considerable 
damage was also done to three fellows named robertson kemp and du 
pont 
for as long and bush and dole continue their duel the chances 
pale for one of the conservative challengers to make a serious run 
for the nomination the alsorans pete du pont jack kemp and pat 
robertson finished in a clump in new hampshire meaning none 
could claim victory even in the subcontest for secondtier 
momentum 
for one of the three to challenge bush or dole he needed a 
clear shot as the campaign moved into the south now it seems 
certain that the spotlight will stay on the frontrunners with at 
least a tad interest in how robertson will do in the bible belt 
pete teeley bushs spokesman said new hampshire republicans 
chose bush because of his leadership and because of his economic 
proposals and because he was a candidate with 20 years foreign 
policy experience as opposed to dole who had served only in 
congress 
bush had a different explanation one based on personal history 
he did what i did in 1980 he said of dole he won in iowa 
and came in and talked about momentum i did what president reagan 
did he reagan came in and started talking the issues and i 
think its working 
dole complained as losers generally do that his views had been 
distorted an indication that issues he cited oil import fees and 
taxes rubbed the wrong way for dole in the conservative granite 
state 
the memory may linger of du pont waving a piece of paper in 
doles face and challenging him to sign the pledge that is 
the pledge not to raise taxes no matter what 
that was sunday night on monday things got worse for dole and 
better for bush 
in his darkest hour with his lead in the polls squeezed to just 
about nothing and many of the pundits laughing behind his back 
bush brought out the best hitter in the history of new england 
baseball and the fellow the republicans call mr conservative 
ted williams posed for pictures with bush and goldwater the 
retired senator from arizona and 1964 gop standardbearer stumped 
by his side and cut a memorable televised campaign ad he said of 
bush hes the man to continue the conservative revolution we 
started 24 years ago 
in the ad broadcast as a hefty percentage of republican voters 
were making up their minds bush said i sense a rising tide 
with your help it will carry me to the white house 
this is the sort of thing that bush needed not only to blunt 
dole in his bid for a knockout punch but also to keep robertson 
kemp and du pont at bay 
they or at least those who survived figured to make their move 
in the south and would have liked a clear shot at the winner of the 
bushdole duel but with goldwater putting his conservative arms 
around bushs shoulders and with bush newly invigorated for his 
battle with dole there is suddenly less room in the inn for kemp 
du pont or robertson 
dole was clearly disconsolate tuesday night 
early in the evening with the votes being counted dole said 
if it hadnt been for the distortion of my positions on tax 
increases and an oil import fee id be 10 points ahead the vice 
president portrayed dole all last week as an advocate of an oil 
import fee and likely to cave in to pressures for a tax increase 
its unfortunate said dole that the vice president of 
the united states who knows better would sink to that level but 
he did it he knows its false on its face and hell have an 
opportunity to answer to that from now on

primary tuesday night declaring that the best america is yet to 
come 
last week in iowa our message started to shine through and we 
won a bronze he told more than 1000 cheering supporters 
gathered at a restored mill building tonight here in new 
hampshire our message came through loud and clear we went for the 
gold and we won it 
with just under 90 percent of the precincts counted dukakis had 
about 36 percent of the vote rep richard gephardt and sen paul 
simon who grabbed the first two spots in the iowa caucuses were 
battling it out for second 
dukakis who will take his campaign south on wednesday sought 
to put to rest questions about his strategy for the region 
the fact of the matter is i dont have a southern strategy 
he said i dont have a northern strategy or a western strategy 
i have an american strategy 
he said we believe in the kind of politics where you say the 
same thing wherever you go in this country the people of 
arkansas and kentucky are not voting for a zip code theyre voting 
for a president of the united states 
as a northeastern liberal dukakis faces his stiffest test in 
the southern states but as the democrat with the biggest campaign 
warchest dukakis has been able to send a plethora of staff to the 
region 
he is working particularly hard in florida with its jewish 
population dukakis wife kitty is jewish in atlanta viewed as 
the capital of the south and in texas where he is seeking the

among the alsorans gary hart and bruce 
babbitt failed in new hampshire to extract themselves from the 
bottom of the sevenman democratic heap but pete du ponts 
slowbutimproved showing on the republican side tuesday gave him 
cause for hope 
none of the lasttier candidates was counting himself out as 
votes from the nations first primary rolled in but in the days to 
come new hampshire still could send a few candidates packing 
before super tuesday rolls around march 8 
proving that in politics all things are relative du pont who 
was running fourth in the fiveman republican field said this 
has been a terrific evening for us here in new hampshire 
he had finished fifth in a sixman field before the withdrawal 
of alexander haig in iowas caucuses a week earlier 
du ponts showing was just shy of jack kemp and ahead of 
robertson according to partial returns all three trailed 
frontrunner george bush and his main rival bob dole 
for the democrats babbitt edged out hart ahead of them were 
jesse jackson and albert gore each of whom had solid organizations 
awaiting them in the south richard gephardt and paul simon were in 
the strong second tier behind winner michael dukakis 
hart who won new hampshire when he ran in 1984 but whose 
candidacy has failed to catch fire since he reentered the 1988 
race called his meager showing at the bottom of the democratic 
pack this time disappointing but not discouraging 
the former colorado senator said he expects to be a candidate 
as far ahead in the future as i can see but he was pragmatic 
about the need to start picking up some solid support that would 
translate into the dollars and delegates needed to win nomination 
i understand that there are standards that have to be met in 
terms of delegates and votes he said it will take at least 30 
to 60 days to determine if i can put together a viable candidacy 
babbitt who had said prior to the new hampshire primary that 
its voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy 
insisted he wasnt ready to start planning his funeral just yet 
im going to move on for a couple of days to washington in a 
couple of days and call and talk to my supporters all over the 
country and ask them this question how can we keep this reform 
movement alive 
jackson said he met with babbitt on tuesday night and discussed 
getting his support 
our message has tremendous overlap i hope that in time we 
will work out some common ground in terms of our politics 
jackson said 
robertson failed to repeat his dramatic secondplace showing 
from iowa but had never claimed hed sweep new hampshire he had 
better prospects in sight in the south and plenty of money on hand 
to propel him forward 
one of the alsorans from the iowa caucuses never even made it 
as far as the new hampshire primary haig last week bowed out and 
threw his support to dole

the us ambassador to honduras on 
tuesday denied american newspaper reports linking highranking 
honduran military officers to colombian cocaine traffickers 
i am the principal and highest official of the united states 
in honduras and i totally disavow this situation that has appeared 
in the newspapers of my country ambassador everett briggs said 
during a news conference in tegucigalpa 
briggs called the stories very imaginative and inventive 
president jose azcona hoyo on tuesday called the reports and 
effort to discredit his government and said he summoned briggs on 
monday to clarify the state departments position on the matter 
the reports azcona hoyo said constitute a campaign to 
discredit the armed forces and my government which has taken a 
series of actions to combat the narcotraffickers 
the new york times reported feb 11 that high honduran military 
officials had become involved with a powerful hondurasbased 
narcotics trafficker juan ramon matta in shipping cocaine to the 
united states the article cited reagan administration officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it added the reagan administration was increasingly concerned 
about the honduran armed forces connections with colombias 
medellin cartel producer of up to 80 percent of all the cocaine 
shipped to the united states 
on sunday the miami herald reported gen humberto regalado 
hernandez the armed forces chief was suspected by us officials 
of protecting colombian traffickers who used honduras as a staging 
base for cocaine shipments from colombia to the united states 
briggs told reporters the attitude of general regalado 
hernandez has been honest and thanks to this we now wage a war 
without quarter against the international drug traffickers 
briggs announced the united states at the invitation of 
honduras will open a permanent office in tegucigalpa next month to 
monitor drug flows

vice president george bushs ties to the reagan 
administraton and support among voters who chose a candidate at the 
last minute helped him recover from his iowa debacle and win new 
hampshires republican primary polls said tuesday 
among the democrats michael dukakis political organization and 
his performance as governor of neighboring massachusetts helped 
bring about his strong primary victory the exit polls said 
while preelection polls had indicated an extremely tight race 
between bush and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
voters who made up their minds in the final days of the new 
hampshire race selected bush pollsters said 
the polls had it neckandneck and bush is winning by more 
than that said jerry strom a polling consultant for nbc news 
the reason is that the late deciders were going to bush 
one possible reason was bushs organization cbs news found 
there was a substantially higher proportion of bush voters who had 
been contacted directly by the bush campaign than dole supporters 
who had heard from the senators campaign i think the thing that 
won it for bush was his organization said warren mitofsky the 
cbs polling chief 
bush after leading strongly in public opinion polls in new 
hampshire saw his advantage melt away after he finished third in 
the iowa caucuses feb 8 beaten by dole and former television 
evangelist pat robertson 
late polls showed bushs decline in new hampshire halt one by 
cbs sunday and monday gave him a slim 4point lead over dole we 
said he had a small lead and thats what it looks like said 
mitofsky 
los angeles times and the cbs newsnew york times polls found 
that bushs government experience weighed in his favor a third of 
republicans told cbs that experience was the most important factor 
in their vote and 54 percent of them voted for bush to 37 percent 
for dole 
dole beat bush among republicans who said they were chiefly 
looking for a strong leader with 48 percent to 21 percent for 
bush but that group made up a smaller share of the republican 
vote 19 percent cbs reported 
the los angeles times found that a sizable portion of 
republicans in new hampshire favored the reagan administration 
more so than was the case among iowa republicans and they 
predomninantly supported bush said times polling chief ia lewis 
people think of bush as someone just representing whatever reagan 
does and they like that lewis said 
identification with with the reagan administration clearly 
helped bush said mitofsky of cbs reagan is popular and the 
people who like reagan went for bush fairly strongly 
moreover bush is doing well because of his long and solid 
support here said lewis he said his poll indicated that almost 
half of bushs supporters decide last year to vote for the vice 
president 
but many final decisions were made virtually at the last minute 
of just over 1000 republicans surveyed by cbs as they left the 
polls 46 percent said they had decided on a candidate after the 
iowa caucuses and 32 percent said they decided in the last three 
days of the campaign 
strom said nbc found that voters who decided in the last few 
days went predominantly for bush as did those who decided more 
than three weeks ago bush was winning early and late and dole 
was winning in the middle immediately after his iowa victory 
strom said 
nbcs poll found that 14 percent of the republican voters made 
their final decision on primary day and they went for bush 36 
percent to 29 percent for dole those who decided during the 
weekend 11 percent of the total by nbcs measure also went for 
bush 44 percent to 31 percent for dole 
nbc also found that one potential trouble area for bush never 
developed while half the republicans believed bush knew more than 
he was saying about the irancontra affair only a fifth thought it 
mattered strom said 
decisions also were made late among democrats 38 percent said 
they chose their candidate in the last three days support for 
dukakis was broad he won among liberals moderates and 
conservatives alike according to an abc newswashington post exit 
poll 
the cbs exit poll found that 42 percent of dukakis supporters 
had been contacted by the governors campaign workers while the 
other campaigns contacted only a third of their voters 
it also found that 55 percent of the democratic voters gave 
dukakis and excellent or above average rating as governor of 
neighborhing massachusetts and 59 percent of them voted for him 
the margin of sampling error for the polls was about 3 percent

with any joss that means luck in chinese 
therell be something to do next week rather than spend eight hours 
on nbcs mindnumbing miniseries the ignoble noble house 
based on james clavells bestselling novel of the same title 
the plot is preposterous the acting spotty the music overdone 
the love scenes embarrassing the special effects fakey and after 
investing eight hours two hours a night sunday through 
wednesday on nbc everything is tied up neatly at the end not 
through any clever plot twist but because of an act of god thanks 
a lot 
pierce brosnan late of remington steele is a fine actor 
but hes too pretty for ian dunross a tough middleaged corporate 
kingpin descended from scottish pirates then this suave exotic 
fellow is given as a love interest gawky deborah raffin as 
goshdarn american casey tcholok a perky corporate raider 
casey is a tipothehat to feminism the rest of the women in 
the cast are the typical array of hookers mistresses or at best 
secretaries 
ben masters manages a believable performance as deceptively 
affable linc barlett caseys boss and honcho of a huge california 
conglomerate but its the villains who get the best of the 
miniseries john rhysdavies as jealous quillan gornt longtime 
noble house rival and khigh diegh the most fun of all as four 
finger wu a wily bandit who operates from a junk in hong kong 
harbor cuffing his honest son into helping toss hapless henchman 
overboard 
the miniseries was shot in london and on location in exotic hong 
kong 
as the miniseries opens dunross is becoming the new taipan or 
boss of noble house a huge hong kongbased trading company he 
has inherited a financial mess from his predecessor denholm 
elliott and must struggle to keep the company from going under 
to that end he entertains a merger offer by a lincs company 
parcon industries 
enter linc accompanied by casey come to hong kong to cut a 
deal talk about your ugly americans during their brief stay 
banks fail stock markets plunge fires rage buildings collapse 
and murders are most foul anybody with a lick of sense would 
skedaddle back to the states and chalk it up to poor junket 
planning and a people who place so much emphasis on joss as the 
chinese must since the word turns up several times a night would 
surely notice that these two havent exactly brought a ray of 
sunshine to their happy port city 
shortly after linc and casey arrive linc secretly meets with 
gornt who entices linc with a possible joint raid on the noble 
house casey in the meantime is linking up with ian everyone 
remains irritatingly pleasant in between natural disasters 
also in the meantime bandits play keepaway with a stolen 
broken halfcoin that figures in an inscrutable ancient tradition 
entitling the bearer to a lucrative favor from the noble house 
though the plot is supposed to take place over a few days it 
seems like years time passage is such a problem that at one point 
the characters have to explain in dialogue what has happened when 
and remark how it all seems so long ago 
for viewers it will all seem so long ago too noble house 
isnt good enough to be good or even bad enough to be good as a 
fourhour junktv snack maybe but for anyone willing to invest 
eight hours good joss

to the surprise of those who believed an 
economic downturn would be under way by now the number of people 
with jobs is at an alltime high generating concern of an entirely 
different sort 
the new concern finding expression among popular economists is 
that the nations fullemployment level might be approaching and 
with it the possibility of rising wages 
in short inflation 
as with all economic fears this too could evaporate but there 
exists some statistical evidence to suggest that a long period of 
wage stability could be nearing an end if the economic expansion 
continues 
in theory the approach of full employment means upward pressure 
on wages and a need to rely on lessskilled workers which combine 
to lower productivity and force prices higher 
more than 114 million civilians were employed in january 1988 
more than 5 million above the figure for january 1986 while the 
labor force has risen in that time the jobless rate has fallen to 
58 percent from 67 percent 
the socalled full employment level in which all who are 
willing and able to work have jobs other than for those who are 
between jobs is difficult to forecast since it reveals itself 
mainly in labor shortages and rising wages 
viewing various sets of statistics economist j patrick bradley 
of pnc financial corp a philadelphia bankholding company 
believes full employment hasnt been reached given the modest 
gains in wages relative to inflation 
various reasons are offered for the absence of strong wage 
gains such as a decline in the level of unionism and a tendency 
for workers to be older and more experienced and already at peak 
earnings 
but says bradley such explanations make little difference 
it merely means that the fullemployment rate has not yet been 
reached and therefore is not yet a source of inflationary 
pressure 
those who place their faith in quarterly economic surveys by the 
national federation of independent business are less certain that 
full employment is still a distance away 
that survey released this week shows very strong hiring plans 
among that organizations 500000 members coupled with already 
recordhigh employment levels such intentions could be interpreted 
as spelling trouble 
dean william dunkelberg of temple universitys school of 
business who conducts the survey found 23 percent of firms had 
job openings in the final quarter of 1987 and that 19 percent plan 
to raise employment in the current quarter 
these are the strongest hiring plans recorded since 1978 on a 
seasonally adjusted basis he said noting that the intent to add 
workers was especially strong in manufacturing with 28 percent of 
such companies planning to hire 
the same survey suggested that wage pressure has begun showing 
up with 23 percent of all companies reporting higher labor costs 
in the final quarter of 1987 
simultaneously the survey showed what dunkelberg termed a 
surprising 5 percentagepoint jump in plans to raise compensation 
bringing to almost onequarter the number of companies with such 
plans 
he reasons that the rather large jump in plans to increase 
compensation may be an early indication that the longexpected 
problems on the wage front may have finally arrived 
partly as a consequence the percent of companies planning to 
raise prices jumped 6 points to 27 percent of all companies that 
increase was the highest recorded for january in three years

theyre married but not married theyre 
divorced but not divorced thats the paradoxical plight of 
thousands of religiously observant jewish women in broken marriages 
although civilly divorced the man wont grant a religious bill 
of divorcement called a get 
only the man can do that under jewish law as observed in 
conservative and orthodox judaism and if he doesnt that leaves 
her in an ambiguous state her marriage ended civilly but still 
binding her religiously 
shes in a limbo neither married nor unmarried says 
benita gaylealmeleh of the american jewish committee who has done 
special research into the problem urging rabbinical action to 
remedy it 
in such circumstances she points out the woman is not free 
to remarry to pick up the pieces and go on with her life her 
marriage has been dissovled but not dissolved 
mrs gaylealmeleh estimates at least 35000 jewish women across 
the country are trapped in that situation 15000 of them in new 
york state alone 
theyre in a terrible predicament she said in an interview 
maintaining that the problem has reached crisis proportions jewish 
law requires no religious release for men to remarry but does for 
women 
it has a tremendous impact on the entire family in trying to 
raise and socialize children its a continuous irritant and cause 
of tension it has the builtin possibility of a continually 
fractured family 
she said men withhold the religious get for various reasons 
sometimes for emotional financial or other blackmail to gain 
concessions about property or child custody 
this happens plenty of times she said in essence its 
extortion she said the possibility of a religious divorce is 
dangled in front of the aggrieved spouse to meet various demands 
in other cases she said women cant obtain religious divorces 
because the former husband is simply neglectful lazy refuses it 
in vindictiveness after the breakup drops out of sight or some 
fluke of cirumstances 
without a get the civilly divorced woman under jewish law 
is termed an agunah or anchored wife not free to remarry 
since further sexual union would be considered adulterous and any 
offspring would be mamzerim or bastards mrs gaylealmeleh 
said 
such children are forbidden to marry other jews and to this 
day they carry a terrible social stigma 
mrs gaylealmeleh program specialist in ajcs interreligious 
affairs department and coordinator of its women of faith program 
said this painful religious problem demands creative and 
immediate action 
she commended the new york board of rabbis for a recent 
resolution urging sanctions against any former spouse who refuses 
to provide a get after a civil divorce if the woman wants one 
such sanctions would involve denial of synagogue membership 
privileges such as the honor of being called to read the torah 
mrs gaylealmeleh called the action a positive step but 
said the likelihood was that if a man had refused to supply a 
get he may well be beyond the point of caring 
for anyone willing to flout community morals this way his 
being called to read the torah probably doesnt make a big 
difference she said however she said the system may be 
effective in some few instances 
the board also recommended that all rabbis urge couples to sign 
prenuptial agreements saying that in event of civil divorce both 
partners will cooperate in arranging for a get 
that however wouldnt solve prior situations 
she also cited drawbacks to a recently recently enacted new york 
state legislation saying a jewish husband who filed for civil 
divorce must also grant his wife a get if she wanted it 
she said the constitutionality of the law has been questioned as 
on the slippery slope of churchstate entanglement and its 
also questionable if jewish law should be subjected to legal 
systems and courts in 50 states 
furthermore she said that such legislation puts the burden 
on women to get the state to compel relief it would require 
emotional timeconsuming and costly litigation an unacceptable 
route for many women 
in reform judaism a civilly divorced woman doesnt also need a 
religious divorce to remarry but it is required in conservative 
and orthodox branches 
its one of the few instances in which jewish law is rife with 
the possibility of mischief mrs gaylealmeleh said 
in a recent address on the problem to a womans conference in 
philadelphia she said that through the centuries rabbis have made 
various efforts to temper the onesidedness of biblical law on 
the matter 
she said attempts have been made to get around the dictum that 
only a man has the right to divorce religiously but 
nevertheless a religious divorce is never granted in the absence 
of or without the consent of the husband

a preliminary draft of a us catholic 
bishops letter on women advocates that all ministerial roles be 
studied in terms of their openness to all persons in the church 
portions of the draft prepared by a committee and still subject 
to change before presentation to the full body of bishops were 
read to an academic conference here by archbishop william levada of 
portland ore religious news service reports 
regarding the ordination of women firmly rejected by the 
vatican but increasingly favored in polls of american catholics 
the draft says 
continuing reflections dialogues and heated controversies in 
regard to the ordination of women demonstrate the importance of 
further study in order to deepen the understanding of this 
question 
saying the vatican does not consider limiting to the priesthood 
to males a question of justice or equal rights the draft adds 
it is acknowledged that certain reasons advanced in the past 
in support of the tradition arise from prejudicial attitudes toward 
women such arguments as an example that women are inferior or in 
a state of subjection to men or are incapable of governing are 
rejected

this for several years when he was a struggling writer in berkeley

its a still night on mcclellan street when a 
dozen cops guns drawn spill from a dark van and race up to a 
twostory brick house a 280pound narc aims an iron battering ram 
at the door 
shouts break the silence police officers search warrant 
running footsteps rumble inside 
the door is down in 35 seconds and police flood in three 
minutes later six people are handcuffed the search for drugs 
begins with officers lifting ceiling panels rummaging in drawers 
shaking a virgin mary statue 
its another night in detroits war against crack another raid 
against potent chunks of cocaine that have snuffed out lives 
destroyed families clogged courts and jails and created an 
epidemic some say may be the worst in the nation 
crack is like a cancer says wayne county sheriff robert 
ficano 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the mcclellan raid police say netted three arrests two ounces 
of crack which fell out of one suspects pants leg and more than 
1000 in cash scenes like this occur roundtheclock in detroit 
since mayor coleman young announced a new assault on crack more 
than two months ago police average a dozen raids a day hundreds 
have been arrested hundreds of thousands of dollars in drugs have 
been seized 
i think its at a war stage us against them said city 
councilman david eberhard if we dont clean up the drugs 
theyll take over we cant turn the city over to the criminal 
element 
i think the community needs to know were doing something 
he added 
the highprofile raids are aimed to show just that the early 
focus has been on crack houses and smalltime operators to show 
citizens as much as traffickers that police mean business 
we attacked the visible part first to get public 
awareness said commander joel gilliam who oversees the police 
departments narcotics unit he said larger traffickers will be 
targeted next 
detroits crack problem is staggering according to police 
state and federal officials 
up to 4000050000 people in detroit and the surrounding area 
have a 50aday crack habit totaling more than 900 million a 
year 
on a given day about 1300 crack houses are operating in 
detroit thousands more dealers work street corners or other 
locations 
cocainerelated emergency room visits to detroit hospitals 
increased sevenfold from the last half of 1984 to the first half 
of 1987 in new york by comparison the increase in such visits 
was about 2 times 
the practice of trading sex for crack is believed largely 
responsible for detroits huge increase in a penicillinresistant 
strain of gonorrhea from 15 cases in 1985 to 2344 last year 
statistics however cannot capture the mindboggling brutality 
that pervades the lives of crack dealers and addicts 
horror stories are endless a teenage woman involved in a crack 
dispute is branded 20 times with a heated potato masher then shot 
the gun barrel pressed against her forehead a baby dies of drug 
intoxication after nursing at her cocaineusing mothers breast 
crack users sell their food stamps beds even protective bars on 
their windows for another piece of the precious rock 
youll sell your mama youll sell your daddy gilliam said 
youll steal youll break into cars youll prostitute its 
called the glass pimp you wont eat you wont sleep thats how 
addicting it is 
many cities including new york dallas and los angeles have 
crack problems but william coonce special agentincharge of the 
local drug enforcement administration office believes detroit may 
be the worst 
he attributes the problem to an explosive combination hard 
economic times access to guns 5000 to 10000 abandoned 
buildings lack of opportunities for teenagers and a per capita 
murder rate that in 1985 and 86 was the worst in the nation in 
1987 there were 645 homicides three fewer than the year before 
police said 
gilliam estimates 6065 percent of detroits killings are 
drugrelated 
some people have become frustrated two men recently admitted 
setting fires last fall at an alleged crack house in an attempt to 
drive dealers from their neighborhood theyve been charged with 
arson 
one of the two said the community supported them and noted it 
was like a neighborhood project 
other people are simply frightened 
the neighbors are scared to death theyre all running for 
cover coonce said very definitely its out of hand 
violence and crack feed on one other crack a blend of cocaine 
and baking soda boiled and dried and broken into rocks can take 
effect in 10 seconds it can create a false sense of confidence 
making users do crazy things 
one man stabbed two relatives dozens of times then took money 
from one of the victims and spent it on crack police said 
you sniff cocaine and you rise to the top of the mountain 
gilliam said you smoke crack you shoot to the top youve 
got to pull them off the ceilings to lock them up 
crack is popular in the inner city because rocks cost as little 
as 5 or 10 and while detroit is the main marketplace trade has 
expanded into the suburbs 
sheriff ficano said his narcotics unit seized 2 million in cash 
last year double that of 1986 authorities also estimate up to 50 
percent of crack customers in detroit are suburbanites

police say one of cracks most frightening aspects is heavy 
teenage involvement 
weve got kids going to school with 3000 and business 
beepers in their pockets gilliam said they dont want to be 
brain surgeons they want to be instantly gratified you have 
immature adolescents with no goals give them a gun put them on 
crack they have no compunction about killing someone 
gilliam said their philosophy is you live fast you die 
young you make a beautiful corpse 
he said teens including his daughter are so jaded they read 
obituaries she wants to know who in her age group has been 
shot he said its a damn vietnam body count its a whole 
different society out there 
teens also know if they get caught theyre relatively immune 
at least from long stretches of time because 85 percent are out 
of prison in 15 months said ron schigur of the county prosecutors 
office 
a 15yearold can be waived to adult court he said but judges 
are often reluctant to allow that 
crack however spans all ages in december police arrested a 
72yearold woman and said they found crack in her sock 
trafficking often occurs in houses where violence and sex are 
commonplace police tell of finding rotting bodies in basements and 
13yearold girls offered as incentives for deals 
trading sex for crack has been tied to a phenomenal increase in 
penicillinaseproducing neisseria gonorrhea michigan had 2797 
cases last year up from 187 in 1986 probably the fastest rate of 
increase in the nation said tim lindman of the michigan department 
of public health most were in detroit 
theres a good deal of sex going on in crack houses basically 
anonymous sex said george gaines deputy director of detroits 
health department people are saying i dont know who it was 
this was a onetime situation 
although the crackdown may ease some of these troubles detroit 
still has problems 
residential drug treatment programs are crowded and the wayne 
county jail was overcrowded 83 percent of the time in 1987 ficano 
said noting that triplebunking or building a new jail are among 
options considered 
while many support the crackdown experts say it isnt a 
complete solution 
this is going after the supply we still have a population 
that wants drugs and will find a way to get them said jacqueline 
morrison senior project consultant at the wayne state research 
addiction institute 
experts also say churches parents and schools must play a role 
in education and attitudes must change 
people must recognize the fact that when folks dont have 
jobs then they feel hopeless and they turn to hopeless things like 
drugs said wayne county commissioner alberta tinsleywilliams 
still she said the raids are a beginning 
theres a sense of urgency in detroit she said youve 
got to start somewhere

at the tender age of 18 when most teenagers are 
thinking about college and careers richard wershe jr faces life 
in prison 
the blond babyfaced wershe was convicted last month of 
possessing eight kilos of cocaine worth about 5 million police 
said that represented the largest single cocaine seizure in city 
history 
wershe was sentenced feb 4 to the mandatory penalty of life in 
prison without parole 
in a city where the fight against drugs is an uphill battle 
this case represented a critical government victory said william 
coonce special agentincharge of the local office of the drug 
enforcement administration 
our total ability as a system to function was at stake he 
said if we couldnt convict this guy as outfront as brash as 
arrogant as he was what could we do 
it was a very important sign to the community we can do 
the job as well as deliver the message if you deal in these 
quantities youre going to go to jail for life 
but coonce added its almost insulting to our profession 
that any 18yearold could get to this kind of stature without us 
being able to snuff him out a long time ago the fact this guy 
is so young is symbolic of whats going on in this city 
wershe known on the street as white boy rick because most 
of his associates are black still faces two other drug charges 
his father richard sr who has sued the police alleging 
harassment recently told the detroit news he and his son worked 
for several years as federal drug informants 
the fbi and dea have declined comment 
the younger wershe was at the top echelons of trafficking in 
detroit supplying cocaine to a major crack dealer under 
investigation coonce said 
even though he looks like baby face nelson judge william 
hathaway said in a hearing last year as far as this court is 
concerned hes worse than a mass murderer 
wershes conviction stemmed from a may 1987 incident in which 
police found the cocaine in a box underneath a porch in the back of 
a house they said he had dropped it there after fleeing officers 
according to testimony wershe was riding in a car stopped for a 
traffic violation in front of his grandmothers house a fight 
broke out when police tried to grab a bag they later retrieved 
containing 29000 
wershe ran from the car but was later recaptured 
more than an hour later officers found the drugs in a box in a 
backyard a block from the grandmothers home at the trial a 
neighbor said wershe ditched the box in her yard and offered her 
500 
defense attorney edward bell said wershe has nothing to do with 
the drugs and didnt know how they got there 
he argued wershe was the victim of police brutality defense 
witnesses said he was punched and hit with a pistol and the drug 
charges were concocted to conceal the beating 
the government acknowledged police thumped wershe but said 
there was no excessive force 
the defense also suggested authorities planted the drugs and 
pinned it on wershe but prosecutors argued it was ludicrous to 
believe police carry around 176 pounds of dope just in case 
during the trial wershe was often surrounded by people wearing 
furs and gold and carrying telephone pagers sometimes associated 
with drug dealers 
he was a local folk hero for the young people who came to 
court coonce said 
bell later said many of the kids hanging around the court 
were simply curious 
wershes father has been charged with threatening a police 
officer who testified against his son wershe sr has filed two 
multimillion dollar lawsuits against the detroit police and 
others alleging harassment invasion of privacy and other charges 
though coonce said wershes sentence may deter some it will not 
stop the flow of drugs in detroit as he said theres not going 
to be any lack for cocaine

britains first major industrial strike in several 
years the 8dayold national walkout by more than 32000 ford 
autoworkers has not been primarily about money 
instead it is an emotional dispute over the auto makers push 
to impose more japanesestyle work practices on reluctant employees 
such practices including computerization more flexibility 
among workers and the cutting of autopart inventories have 
angered hourly workers enough for them to reject a sweetened offer 
from ford by more than a 60 percent margin even though union 
negotiators had recommended it 
ironically such practices also have made ford motor co ltd 
british subsidiary of the us auto maker and the largest auto 
maker in britain especially vulnerable to this strike 
the companys production in europe was quickly affected when the 
walkout began feb 8 because the new efficiency at its european 
plants means they also now are more interdependent 
the strike fords first british strike in nearly a decade has 
halted production at all fords 22 british plants 
the action also has prompted the layoff of more than 9700 
workers and disrupted production at a ford plant in genk belgium 
which suffered a shortage of britishmade parts 
it also has threatened production at ford plants in west germany 
and spain which also rely on parts made at fords british plants 
in addition it has cost ford 40 million a day at showroom 
prices in lost british car production 
talks between the transport and general workers union which 
represents twothirds of the workers representatives of the 11 
unions that represent the rest and company officials resumed today 
after an 11day hiatus 
our primary goal has been to improve efficiency and 
productivity said a ford spokesman who wasnt identified in 
accordance with british custom 
ford believes it needs to impose more efficient manufacturing 
methods to boost productivity and better fight off its competitors 
such as nissan motor co in a market burdened with overcapacity 
nissan operates a highly productive plant in sunderland in 
northeast england 
we are not attempting slavishly to copy the japanese we are 
attempting solutions to our own problems the ford spokesman said 
ford wants to introduce more flexibility so that for example a 
skilled worker could work on a production line but some skilled 
workers apparently balk at working alongside unskilled workers 
and some workers also appear to fear being overworked 
strikers have criticized japanesestyle work practices but the 
economist said the strike has been led by men in dagenham 
assembly plant in booming east london where workers feel they 
can demand big bribes in return for changing their work habits not 
so in northeast england 
indeed not all british workers have reacted this way to the 
increasing use of such manufacturing methods at japanese and 
nonjapanese plants throughout britain 
many british workers in poorer areas of the country such as the 
northeast have felt downtrodden by the class system and are 
intimately familiar with britains widespread unemployment these 
have eagerly embraced the japanese practices of equality and job 
security 
the new manufacturing techniques ford imposed some worker 
flexibility computerization and the slashing of inventories of 
auto parts to reduce costs increased the auto makers 
productivity and profitability sharply 
each ford employee produced 95 cars in 1986 vs 64 each in 
1984 in britain ford produced more than 383000 cars in 1987 in 
britain 
the british subsidiarys pretax profit tripled to about 569 
million from 191 million in 1986 analysts estimate ford wont 
report its results for a few months 
union officials said opposition to fords offer also centered on 
its threeyear term the first of its kind ever sought in the 
british auto industry previous contracts have been for one or two 
years 
some workers said they also object to linking their pay 
increases to government statistics for inflation because they claim 
the government underestimates the true rate of increase in consumer 
prices 
the companys sweetened threeyear contract offer included a pay 
rise of 7 percent in the first year followed by rises of 25 
percent above the level of inflation in the scond and third years 
the present pay of a middlerange worker is 327 a week 
the last major industrial strike in britain was a yearlong 
walkout by more than 90000 coal miners in 19841985 
fords british workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978

like the easygoing downhome characters they 
portray in their television commercials sausage kings jimmy dean 
and jerry owens dont give the impression they are fighting whole 
hog for the fattest share of the market 
it seems mostly a gentlemans competition for leadership in the 
breakfast sausage market between the two dallasbased companies 
whose officials praise each others products as high quality 
jimmy dean meat co ranks first nationally while the regionally 
distributed owens country sausage leads in texas according to both 
companies most recent ac nielsen co market share figures that 
exclude link and microwave sausage 
each claims to be the leader in the southwest region although 
they decline to release those figures 
were tough competitors but theres plenty of room says 
former entertainer jimmy dean who heads his company of the same 
name 
they are formidable competitors we continually go at it tooth 
and nail with each other says jerry owens chairman of the 
venerable 60yearold owens country sausage 
both jimmy dean and jerry owens personally pitch their products 
on tv the two texans speak with an easy drawl about home and 
family and hearty breakfasts 
deans celebrity status came almost 30 years ago when his big 
bad john countrywestern song hit the charts he also hosted a 
television variety show 
his answer on how he got into the sausage business is his 
standard one even in a telephone interview from his boat the 
big bad john floating somewhere south of miami where dean is 
wintering 
had you ever seen my act you would realize diversification 
was imperative i was in the hog business in plainview and the 
market fell out and we were losing out quality sausage was 
something i didnt think existed said dean a remark sure to 
leave the owens people aghast 
dean founded the company with his brother don in 1969 but the 
brothers waged a nineyear legal battle when jimmy dean made 
critical remarks about his brothers management of the company in 
the 1970s don dean is no longer with the company 
in 1986 jimmy dean was ordered by a dallas jury to pay don 
500000 in damages for violating a 1980 agreement to keep quiet 
about his brother a federal appeals court overturned that last 
year 
family relationships at owens have been smoother 
owens attained his reputation selling sausage as his father 
cb owens did before him but from his appearance and manner 
owens could easily pass for a countrywestern star himself 
our emphasis is on our familys involvement with the company 
on a daytoday basis and the family heritage and a history of 
reliability and consistency he said sporting a westerncut 
corduroy jacket plaid shirt and thin gold chain around his neck 
jerry owens son stewart is now president of the company 
jerry owens said it never really occurred to him to do anything 
but take over the family business which started back in 1938 with 
the idea of using ham loin and shoulder cuts in sausage instead 
of using it to get rid of the trimmings 
pork sausage was an abused product owens explained 
while both companies are headquartered here both are now owned 
by bigger outofstate corporations that allow them to continue to 
market their products under their own brand names 
while dean is distributed nationally owens is marketed from 
arizona to mississippi and as far north as oklahoma and arkansas 
in 1984 jimmy dean meat co was acquired by chicagobased sara 
lee corp which also owns other smaller sausage companies owens 
was acquired by bob evans farms inc of columbus ohio in 1987 
i think thats a big enough market that both are highly 
regarded in their respective areas i dont sense that either one 
is out to murder the other said elliott schlang senior vice 
president of prescott ball amp turben an investment firm in 
cleveland 
he called the bob evansowens merger a very nice geographic 
expansion though its too early to tell if it will be successful 
while their advertising harks back to home cookin and simpler 
times both sausage companies also are venturing into more 
modernday markets with biscuits and microwave foods that are 
quick and easy to serve 
convenience is the deal today owens said lifestyles are 
kind of changing with more working moms breakfast in many 
households has become getting a bite on the run 
his latest tv commercials show owens hawking a sausage biscuit 
that can be heated in the microwave oven 
likewise the jimmy dean company is pushing english muffins 
topped with ham and cheese or sausage dean said the company will 
soon be testmarketing a small packaged hamburger but declined to 
give more details 
mesquitesmoked sausage is being marketed in the dallas area 
while microwaveable sausage is being tested in several markets 
said ed jenkins vice president for marketing at jimmy dean 
the owens family also plans to get into the restaurant business 
relying on the expertise of bob evans successful chain in the 
midwest to help get a new restaurant in irving texas off the 
ground in march

officer is shotgun man on a crew conducting daily drug raids 
hes a foot soldier in the citys war against crack 
armed with a 12gauge shotgun hillbilly is the first cop to 
enter dark crack houses and abandoned buildings followed by a crew 
of six to eight others he secures the premises looking for guns 
and people carrying them the task takes about 30 tense seconds 
the job takes a lot more steel nerves a quick mind and plenty 
of guts 
you never get used to it he said youre always scared 
youd be a fool if you werent your mind is more occupied with 
the entry you always get a lump fear of the unknown 
judgment is critical you have a decision to make he said 
you hope its the right one 
hillbilly given the nickname by coworkers because of his 
kentucky roots has been a cop for 17 years 11 in narcotics in 
that time hes seen or heard it all pit bulls guarding crack 
houses people whove used children as shields and dealers who sat 
upstairs while a hooded bound victim of an executionstyle murder 
rotted in the basement 
their world is drugs he said everything else is 
immaterial 
hillbilly said a contract was put out on his life years ago he 
had 24hour guards

whats depressing and frightening to us is they pick up the 
guns so easily he said well probably end up there in 
another two or three weeks 
hillbilly also has no illusions about his impact on drug 
trafficking 
were not naive to think were stopping any major drug 
distributors in the area he said but each complaint he said 
must be pursued no matter how small 
its nice when you get a few of the bad characters off the 
street he said whether were helping society well they 
have to want to help themselves 
hillbilly said the worst part of the job is when cops are 
killed its heartbreaking you wonder he said is it all 
worth it for eight rocks of crack hes laying in the casket

a telephone company attempting to recruit 
workers finds 84 percent of applicants fail the entrylevel test a 
congressional study shows most highschool juniors cannot write a 
simple letter seeking a summer job 
a steelworker misorders 1 million in parts because he cannot 
read well an insurance clerk who doesnt understand decimals pays 
a claimant 2200 instead of 22 
illiteracy caused by poor education has become an economic time 
bomb threatening both the quality of the american work force and 
the nations ability to compete on world markets government 
policymakers say 
the department of education estimates more than 27 million 
americans older than 17 cannot read or write well enough to perform 
basic requirements of everyday life another 45 million are 
considered barely competent in basic skills 
that means more than 72 million one out of every three adults 
may lack the reading and writing skills they need to find work 
and the number is growing annually by more than 2 million federal 
officials say 
these statistics coincide with a surge in demand for workers who 
not only can read and write but who also can use computers 
understand technological concepts and think independently in an 
economy that is shifting to services and information and away from 
manufacturing 
moreover this erosion of worker literacy comes at a time when 
americas competitors in asia and europe are forging ahead with 
educated work forces that may come to dominate the hightechnology 
business of the 21st century 
we need to determine what to do with the substantial fraction 
of our population thats illequipped to compete in a global 
economy said indiana university professor lawrence mikulecky 
a study commissioned by the department of labor titled 
workforce 2000 published last june estimated that between now 
and the end of the century for the first time in us history a 
majority of all new jobs will require postsecondary education 
this prospect presents a great risk to minority workers who 
historically have lacked the schooling and skills needed to exploit 
job opportunities said the study conducted by the hudson 
institute a private research organization 
if that pattern persists the study said by the year 2000 
the problems of minority unemployment crime and dependency will be 
worse than they are today without substantial adjustments blacks 
and hispanics will have a smaller fraction of the jobs of the year 
2000 than they have today while their share of those seeking work 
will have risen 
the problem is compounded by a declining number of people 
entering the labor pool a consequence of the sharp dropoff in 
birth rates that followed the postwar baby boom 
some personnel executives say the literacy crisis already has 
hurt them new york telephone co discovered last year that 84 
percent of its new york city applicants flunked the companys 
entrylevel exam which included basic questions on vocabulary and 
numerical relationships 
the business council for effective literacy a 
corporatesponsored group has documented instances in which 
employees misordered millions of dollars in parts overpaid bills 
and endangered workplace safety in one case a feedlot operator 
who misread a label killed a pen full of cattle by giving them 
poison instead of grain 
foreign companies building factories in the united states also 
have been rudely awakened at toyota motor corps us 
manufacturing operations for example personnel managers now test 
the educational level of all prospective employees 
theyre not just assuming that because someone comes in with a 
highschool diploma hes going to be prepared said paul jurmo 
program associate at the business council for effective literacy 
definitions of literacy vary greatly but some tests have served 
as important guides in 1985 for example the department of 
education asked 3400 people aged 20 and older to answer at least 
20 of 26 simple questions correctly nearly 13 percent failed 
other measurements are considered equally discouraging a study 
mandated by congress in 1984 found that fewer than 400 of 2000 
11th graders could adequately write a note applying for a summer 
job at a swimming pool 
college board test scores have fallen about 8 percent over the 
past 20 years while test performance abroad has risen in an 
international calculus and algebra test done a few years ago the 
best us 12th graders came in last among students from the most 
developed countries japanese finished first 
estimates on the cost of workplace illiteracy also vary but are 
believed to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars the 
institute for the study of adult literacy at penn state university 
has said the cost is at least 225 billion per year just in terms 
of lost productivity welfare and related crime and prison expenses 
in addition at least 25 billion is spent by companies and 
private groups to upgrade worker education but most of this effort 
reaches only a small fraction of those who need it most says david 
harman a columbia university professor who has done extensive 
research in the area 
a great deal of illiteracy remains obscured partly because many 
older employees are sensitive about their lack of skills fearing 
they could be fired or face ridicule by seeking help 
some devise elaborate ways to conceal inability to read or 
write including feigning nearsightnedess or taking job 
applications home to have spouses complete them said eli zal 
executive director of literacy volunteers of new york city inc a 
nonprofit group that organizes classes for adults 
there are some encouraging signs millions of illiterate or 
barely literate adults are starting to take advantage of a growing 
range of educational programs offered not only by voluntary and 
government groups but labor unions and employers themselves 
the federally funded adult basic education program the largest 
single literacy effort in the nation enrolled 31 million people 
in 1986 up from 25 million in 1984 
many large companies have started contributing money to 
community efforts drafted tutors to help disadvantaged workers and 
organized schools of last resort to provide basic instruction 
general motors corp and international business machines corp 
for example together spend at least 700 million annually on adult 
education other companies such as polaroid corp standard oil 
co ford motor co and liberty mutual insurance group offer 
remedial classes in plants and offices 
part of this corporate effort arises from a gradual realization 
among executives that its in their longterm interest to have an 
adaptable and educated work force but many in business still may 
not appreciate the magnitude of the crisis according to robert w 
goddard publication director at liberty mutual insurance who 
wrote on the subject in a recent issue of personnel journal 
magazine 
the major force driving corporate america to attack illiteracy 
is the same one that united the colonies 200 years ago either hang 
together on this issue or hang separately said goddard

two nights a week demetrius mosley leaves his 
job at a toystore warehouse for a midtown manhattan skyscraper 
where volunteers help him read newspaper ads and write simple 
sentences in a frayed notebook three months ago he could barely 
write his name 
it takes a lot for a person to say i need help said 
mosley 26 who is enrolled in a class run by literacy volunteers 
of new york city inc a lot of people are scared to admit it 
at 630 pm the gulf amp western buildings 40thfloor cafeteria 
becomes a school where mosley and about 70 other adults many of 
them poor and unable to read beyond the secondgrade level receive 
tutoring in the literacy demands of everyday life ranging from 
paying the rent to getting a drivers license 
some seek help to read dimestore novelettes others want to 
study the bible or even opera librettos literacy volunteer 
officials said 
but for many the training is vital to their ability to work and 
earn a paycheck 
the students are taught by professionals including advertising 
executives accountants and teachers some from manhattans swank 
private schools all are recruited by the literacy volunteers 
which holds classes in 10 sites citywide 
when adults dont know how to read and write they dont have 
much faith in themselves said eli zal executive director of the 
literacy volunteers he said the group gets a large part of its 
budget from corporate donors 
because of television publicity and a growing awareness of the 
nations illiteracy problem the literacy volunteers office has 
been inundated not only with applications from prospective 
students but tutors as well there is a 10month waiting list for 
student spaces and for the first time a waiting list for tutors 
who receive a special training course before teaching a class 
these people really want to learn thats what is exciting to 
me said ann heininger a 30yearold volunteer tutor who works 
for coopers amp lybrand a large public accounting firm 
she began tutoring about three years ago and it has since become 
a regular part of her routine she said during that time she has 
helped students learn to scan helpwanted ads and write notes to 
creditors about disputed bills she recalled helping one student 
read a gambling handbook 
i try to get my students to help each other she said one 
of the biggest things is to get their confidence up and that 
strategy helps 
mosley one of a halfdozen students taught by ms heininger in 
her current class said he decided to seek help partly because of 
his job at a toys r us warehouse where he needed to recognize the 
names of games and other toys 
when i first came to this class i couldnt read picking up a 
book was like a disease he said but now no problem when you 
come to realize you can do this its great 
nizam ali a 28yearold student in ms heiningers class said 
he sought help after watching a tv ad about illiteracy 10 months 
ago unable to read ali only had been able to get errand jobs or 
other work that didnt require filling out a job application he 
said now he is reading simple romantic novels and wants a 
highschool diploma 
since i started here its done a lot for me he said i 
know how to do things write a check read a sign the teachers 
here they help you a lot they have a lot of patience 
zal estimated nearly 70 percent of literacy volunteer students 
are employed and most want improved skills to help them at work 
although that is important zal said he is concerned about what he 
called a preoccupation with workplace literacy that also could be 
harmful 
its one thing to learn how to read names on a paintchip 
chart for your job he said but where does that person go to 
learn to read a bedtime story to his children if workplace 
literacy is where it stops it is rather frightening

although many employers realize they must 
bolster workers skills to stay competitive others are 
restructuring so employees often dont have to read write or think 
a change some educators call dumbing down 
examples already abound from the automatic teller machines at 
banks to the electronic scanners at grocery checkouts to the 
pictures of hamburgers instead of digits on the cashregister 
buttons at fastfood outlets 
supporters of these computerized innovations say they raise 
efficiency and cut overhead and retraining costs critics agree 
such strategies can be helpful but often are based on the 
assumption that illiteracy in the work force is intractable 
there are jobs that will be dumbed down the problem is that 
someone has to service the computers that do the thinking said 
eunice n askov director of the institute for the study of adult 
literacy at penn state university 
another problem she said is that dumbing down decreases job 
security and will likely raise turnover rates at jobs in which 
promotions are unlikely 
of course people want to be able to advance in their jobs 
she said fastfood cashiering is a dumbdown job but employees 
cant advance so they eventually drop out 
lawrence mikulecky an indiana university professor and literacy 
expert said some companies opt for the dumbingdown approach 
simply because of the retraining costs which can become 
prohibitive among workers who lack a highschool education 
to give you an idea of the magnitude it takes about 100 hours 
to move somebody up one grade level so from sixth grade to high 
school youre talking about a substantial amount of time he 
said 
youre talking about hundreds and hundreds of hours of 
training nobody takes those decisions lightly he said its a 
major investment and companies have to take a look at whos worth 
investing in 
many companies dispute the argument that replacing people with 
computers is a longrange danger to a skilled work force large 
grocery chains for example have found automatic checkout systems 
that track inventory can alleviate timeconsuming clerk jobs and 
free workers for more challenging tasks such as managing 
delicatessen counters 
at the great atlantic amp pacific tea co a leading chain with 
more than 1100 stores computerized checkouts have raised 
accuracy decreased customer waiting time and largely eliminated 
the need for clerks to stamp individual prices on items said 
company spokesman michael rourke 
im not sure i would buy the premise that the technology is 
put in place to make decisions for the workers he said im 
saying the technology were putting into effect is to improve 
efficiency and improve speed in making decisions and hopefully 
overcome some of the menial labor tasks 
on a broader scale such a strategy is part of the longrange 
plans of automaking giant general motors corp which once 
predicted it would go from one technical job for every 56 manual 
jobs to a 11 ratio by 1995 the company already is ahead of 
schedule 
one possible result of such a trend educators say is a 
polarization of the work force into a small number of highly 
trained professionals and a majority of employees largely unable to 
advance from relatively simple tasks 
when your choice is i cant hire somebody for under 12 an 
hour and its going to take me 500 hours of training then maybe 
you fire six of those people and have the one remaining directed by 
a computer mikulecky said

ashtontate corp and compaq computer corp have 
scheduled announcements for wednesday that mark the personal 
computer industrys steady transition to a more powerful internal 
traffic cop 
ashtontate corp is to unveil a vastly improved version o its 
dbase software the dominant program for managing information 
stored in personal computers 
dbase iv is capable of running under the new traffic cop 
operating system2 the stateoftheart software for directing 
traffic inside a personal computer 
separately compaq is to announce wednesday it is beginning 
deliveries of operating system2 for use in compaq personal 
computers 
the announcements mark the growing acceptance of operating 
system2 since its announcement last april by microsoft corp the 
software allows computers to run several jobs at the same time and 
to handle bigger programs than can be handled by its predecessor 
msdos 
os2 will supersede msdos as the operating system of choice by 
the end of 1990 with 37 million copies shipped that year vs 15 
million copies of msdos forrester research inc of cambridge 
mass predicted recently 
ashtontates dbase iv should help the torrance califbased 
company against challengers such as borland international inc 
microrim inc and oracle corp according to analysts who got 
previews of the product 
this product is a major advance over dbase iii plus in almost 
every dimension edward m esber jr chairman and chief 
executive said in an interview tuesday 
ashtontate had more than 60 percent of sales of database 
managers for personal computers last year the company says 
houstonbased compaq is highlighting the ability of its 
computers to run operating system2 as part of a publicrelations 
battle with international business machines corp which says its 
new personal system2 computers are best suited to run os2 
compaq is to have 21 independent software developers including 
ashtontate at an industry forum commenting on their plans for 
programs that will take advantage of os2s features 
compaq intends to demonstrate that operating system2 runs 
faster on compaq computers than on ibm computers although ibm was 
involved in os2s development michael swavely compaqs vice 
president of marketing said in an interview tuesday 
the new version of ashtontates dbase features a redesigned 
look known as what you see is what you get and spares computer 
novices from having to do any programming to enter or retrieve 
information from the computer 
for advanced users a new programming language includes 245 new 
or improved commands and incorporates the industrystandard 
structured query language created by international business 
machines corp 
in addition to running under the new operating system2 dbase 
iv can also run under microsofts older msdos which is still the 
one used on most personal computers 
dbase iv includes a compiler that allows it to run 10 times as 
fast as dbase iii plus ashtontate said the compiler reduces the 
instructions in a program to a machine language that a computer can 
read rapidly 
esber said the new version contains about 400000 lines of 
programming code vs 106000 in dbase iii plus 
the price is 795 up from 695 for dbase iii plus current 
dbase users can buy upgrades to dbase iv for 175 
esber said the program was being announced early because the 
company will be showing it in a national tour led by ibm that 
begins next week 
some of ashtontates competitors have stumbled in efforts to 
beat the company to the market with database managers that work 
with operating system2 
borland and oracle have failed to meet their own deadlines for 
database managers that run under operating system2 however they 
may still beat ashtontate to market because esber said dbase iv 
might not be available until the end of july

northwest airlines announcement that it 
will lay off 5300 mechanics and baggage handlers if its flight 
attendants strike is a ploy to pit the two unions against each 
other a union official says 
northwest spokesman redmond tyler said monday that the 
announcement made in a letter was only a precaution required by 
international association of machinists labor contracts with 
republic airlines northwest acquired republic in 1986 
but jeff musto a spokesman for the teamsters said northwests 
letter was a ploy to play the unions against each other and lower 
morale he said the letter would backfire and draw the unions 
closer together 
the letter was sent last weekend to 2900 mechanics and 2400 
baggage handlers represented by the iam in it northwest said 
although your company does not expect a flight attendants strike 
it is impossible to predict whether the flight attendants will 
actually go on strike 
you may be placed on temporary nowork status due to a 
reduction in force if there is a strike 
northwests 6500 flight attendants represented by the 
teamsters can strike at 1101 pm feb 26 bargaining between the 
airline and the union is expected to resume next week 
the iam which represents 20000 ground workers at northwest 
and the pilots union have not said whether they will honor a strike 
by flight attendants

firestone tire amp rubber co said tuesday it 
planned to spin off its worldwide tire business into a 15 billion 
joint venture to be 75 percent owned by tokyobased bridgestone 
corp 
firestone said the transaction which must be approved by its 
shareholders was expected to result in a 1 billion cash 
distribution to firestone shareholders as part of a major financial 
restructuring according to a joint statement 
the company also said its board of directors adopted a poison 
pill takeover defense 
firestone stock soared 925 to 45 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading following the disclosures 
the surprise announcements came amid speculation that firestone 
would sell its akron ohiobased tire division to the italian tire 
manufacturer pirelli spa 
according to the trade publication rubber amp plastics news 
firestone was the worlds fifthlargest tire company in terms of 
sales with 1986 tire sales of 23 billion 
firestone posted total profit of 103 million and revenue of 
38 billion in the year ended oct 31 1987 
the tentative agreement with bridgestone calls for firestone to 
transfer tire assets and liabilities with an equity value of about 
15 billion to the joint venture 
the venture would be financed initially with 750 million in 
equity from bridgestone 250 million from firestone and 500 
million in debt the statement said 
bridgestone would own about 75 percent of the company and 
firestone 25 percent the statement said 
the two companies plan to operate the joint venture which will 
be known as the firestone tire co as a relatively autonomous 
business unit subject to the direction and control of a board of 
directors consisting of persons representing the owners the 
statement said 
firestone spokesman robert troyer said the company would retain 
its 1500 car care centers firestone diversified products which 
includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building 
products firestone synthetic rubber and latex co which 
manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in 
liberia africa and firestone car rental inc 
troyer said the tire division employs 30000 people worldwide 
while the rest of firestones businesses employ 23500 
the joint venture would be based in akron ohio and would be 
assigned the exclusive right to use firestones name on tires 
throughout the world 
the tentative agreement also calls for the joint venture to 
arrange contracts for raw materials with firestones remaining 
businesses and to supply tires to its car care centers 
in a related move tuesday firestones board adopted a poison 
pill antitakeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors 
the plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20 
percent or more of firestones common stock without board approval 
the company said the plan was intended both to ensure that 
firestones shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint 
venture with bridgestone and to protect the full value of its 
shareholders investment in the company 
weekend news reports in rome and milan italy quoted pirelli 
officials as saying their company had the financial strength to 
acquire firestone and added that pirelli representatives had 
visited firestones world headquarters in chicago last week 
i have no comment on the pirelli deal said firestone 
spokesman robert troyer that story was based on rumor and i 
have no comment on rumors 
the announcement on the bridgestone deal came as firestones 
board met in chicago for a regularly scheduled session 
firestone is the thirdlargest tire manufacturer in the united 
states behind goodyear tire amp rubber co and uniroyal goodrich 
tire co 
in previous interviews firestone chairman john j nevin had 
acknowledged the company might withdraw from the tire business 
firestone structured the tire business as a freestanding unit 
last november when its corporate staff moved from akron to chicago 
the company will seek shareholder approval next month to change its 
name to firestone inc it was not immediately known if shareholders 
would be asked to approve the joint venture at that meeting

northrop corp said tuesday its earnings rose 
275 percent in the fourth quarter and 129 percent for the year 
primarily because of money saved from the cancellation of its f20 
tigershark program 
the results also reflected a higher level of research and 
development on several classified projects for the pentagon 
for the three months ended dec 31 the company earned 349 
million or 74 cents per share compared to a year earlier when it 
netted 93 million or 20 cents per share

million or 201 per share compared to 412 million or 89 cents 
per share while revenue rose 78 percent to 605 billion from 
561 billion 
the major factor in the increased earnings the company said 
was the absence of spending on the f20 a fighter canceled in late 
1986 those costs totaled 236 million in 1986 including 105 
million in the fourth quarter 
northrop poured more than 1 billion in its own money into 
developing the f20 which was designed primarily for foreign 
countries as a lowercost alternative to the f15 and f16 but it 
was never able to find any buyers 
however 1987 results were depressed by a secondquarter 125 
million writedown on a classified government project widely 
believed to be the stealth bomber 
northrop earnings also were depressed by an unspecified amount 
as the company continued to pump its own funds into developing a 
prototype of the air forces 21st century warplane the advanced 
tactical fighter 
northrop and lockheed are leading competing teams of defense 
contractors seeking a 40 billion production contract for the atf 
aerospace was northrops only business to show improvement it 
had an operating profit of 592 million in the fourth period 
comared to a loss of 48 million a year earlier for the full 
year it earned 2201 million compared to 66 million in 1986 
the companys electronics unit saw operating profits drop to 
236 million from 368 million for the quarter and to 70 million 
from 997 million for the year primarily because of lower revenue 
and profit margins on the mx missile program 
the companys aerospace services segment posted a loss of 
300000 for the quarter compared to a profit of 43 million a 
year earlier for all of 1987 its profit was 103 million less 
than half its 1986 level of 215 million

eastern airlines has corrected many of the 
safety problems that led to a 95 million fine two year ago but a 
small airline eastern is enlisting to combat a possible strike 
faces safety penalties of its own the federal aviation 
administration disclosed tuesday 
the separate faa findings surfaced as easterns safety record 
came under renewed scrutiny at a congressional hearing where 
eastern pilots at times laughed derisively at some of the 
assurances on safety made by eastern executives 
eastern has been in the midst of labor problems for months with 
charges by the unions that easterns management is cutting corners 
on safety the 10000member machinists union has been locked in 
talks under a federal mediator and easterns 4000 pilots have not 
said whether they would work if the machinists went on strike 
thomas j matthews sr ake by mechanics eastern might be 
forced out of business eastern has lost 900 million since 1978 
including 1817 million last year 
two years ago eastern was fined a record 95 million by the faa 
for a broad range of maintenance and recordkeeping violations in 
a followup report on the airline since the fine the faa said 
tuesday that while many of the maintenance problems appear to have 
been resolved some concerns persist 
a threemonth review of eastern that ended last november shows 
substantial progress has been made anthony broderick the faas 
associate administrator for aviation standards said in a statement 
accompanying the report 
however there are areas that need attention including 
maintenance procecures that identify repeated failures of the same 
item he said 
broderick also said that eastern still must reduce the number of 
postponed maintenance items carried over from day to day on 
aircraft and the faa report noted that while easterns management 
has improved manuals operating specifiations and maintenance 
inspection procedures agency inspectors could not say for certain 
if eastern is now complying with its own program and 
procedures 
eastern in a statement from its miami headquarters noted that 
the faa report shows eastern has take action to deal with 52 of the 
53 areas of concern cited two years the airline said the faas 
latest review reflects attempts by the carrier to correct past 
problems 
over the past two years eastern has concentrated on upgrading 
the quality of its flight and maintenance performance phil 
bakes easterns president and chief executive officer said in a 
statement 
but a separate faa report prompted questions among some members 
of congress about easterns recently announced plans in event of a 
strike at the miamibased airline 
eastern recently said it was leasing 26 of its jetliners to 
orion air lift services inc a cargo carrier based in raleigh 
nc and that in event of a strike orion would fly some of 
easterns routes using its own personnel 
but a report issued by the faa on monday cast doubts on orions 
safety record the agency disclosed that it is preparing to take 
enforcement action including a civil penalty against orion for 
past safety infractions 
government scrutiny of orion documented a large number of 
serious safety infractions including systematic difficulties 
with the use of operating and maintenance handbooks and training 
programs said broderick the faa official 
the infractions found at orion are being corrected to prevent 
similar occurrences in the future and the corrections permit 
orion to safely operate its cargo business said broderick in a 
statment although not specifically addressing the question of 
whether orion would be permitted to operate scheduled passenger 
service 
the faa must approve such authority 
during the hearings on captitol hill eastern was accused of 
using orion to break a possible strike 
on the basis of the faa report rep cardiss collins dill 
chairwoman of the subcommittee characterized orion as an airline 
in near shambles including problems with pilots and mechanics 
training maintenance records and management 
james l heffernan an orion vice president told the 
subcommittee that virtually all of the problems cited by the faa 
have been corrected

negotiators reached agreement tuesday to end a 
nineday strike that has halted production at ford motor cos 22 
plants in britain and cost the automaker more than 300 million 
company and union officials said 
the deal will be submitted to fords 32000 striking workers on 
thursday and if approved could allow the automaker to resume 
production next monday officials said 
the settlement came after ford agreed to a twoyear pact with 
total minimum pay hikes of 14 percent negotiators said ford 
previously insisted on a threeyear contract which auto workers 
opposed 
ford said it will guarantee full pay to union members who are 
temporarily laid off the company said it would not permanently 
terminate any worker who does not volunteer to leave 
the agreement also stipulates that workrule changes would be 
decided at the plant level instead of being imposed by management 
said mick murphy chief negotiator for the 12 unions involved 
the contract also provides for increased pension benefits and an 
improved health plan 
we see it as a truly historic victory not only for ford 
workers but for trade unionists up and down the country murphy 
said after nine and a half hours of talks 
the deal was called a potential victory for common sense by 
john hougham chief negotiator for ford motor co ltd the british 
subsidiary of the us automaker 
he denied that the automaker was pressured into the agreement by 
its detroitbased parent or ford of europe 
the walkout which was fords first strike in britain in nearly 
a decade began feb 8 three days after contract talks broke down 
under terms of the agreement reached tuesday weekly wages for 
an assembly worker making a basic 184 pounds or 320 will 
increase to 197 pounds or 343 in the first year of the new 
contract negotiators said 
talks to provide the same benefits for hourly and whitecollar 
workers will be completed within two years the company said 
i do believe the company will get the changes in work 
practices it wants murphy said but they will get them under 
the circumstances when they will carry the workforce with them 
there will be cooperation to bring about the changes we 
need hougham said 
the strike prompted the layoff of more than 9700 workers and 
disrupted production at a ford plant in genk belgium which 
suffered a shortage of britishmade parts 
the strike has cost ford 23 million pounds or about 40 million 
a day the automaker has estimated 
fords british workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978

sales of existing homes held steady in 1987 at 
close to 4 million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the 
october stock market collapse a national real estate trade group 
reported tuesday 
the national association of realtors said that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes and condominiums totaled 3885 million units 
last year down a slight 03 percent from the 1986 level of 3897 
million units sales in both years were the fastest pace of this

meanwhile the average price of an existing home rose to a 
nationwide median of 84300 at the close of last year an increase 
of 51 percent in 1987 slightly ahead of the rise in consumer

new york city and boston maintained their rankings as the most 
expensive places to buy homes while providence ri and hartford 
conn had the biggest percentage price gains out of 53 
metropolitan areas surveyed 
the median price of an existing home averaged 180800 in new

percent in hartford 20 percent in washington dc and 182 
percent in albany ny 
fourteen cities in the survey concentrated in depressed energy 
and farm areas of the country saw home prices decline during 1987 
the biggest price drop was 72 percent in houston followed by a 56 
percent decline in oklahoma city 
in all 22 states enjoyed sales increases in 1987 led by a 262 
percent surge in sales in alaska and identical increases of 188 
percent in louisiana and massachusetts alaska and lousiana were 
both rebounding from big sales declines in 1986 while the 
massachusetts increase followed a sizable 1986 advance 
also enjoying big gains were georgia with an 185 percent 
increase and north dakota and maine with advances of 179 percent 
and 143 percent respectively 
the northeast continues as the strongest region but we saw 
considerable strength in the south and midwest two areas which had 
been lagging the rest of the country said john tucillo chief 
economist for the realtors group 
twentytwo states suffered sales declines last year led by a 
138 percent drop in washington state sales fell off 133 percent 
in virginia followed by declines of 97 percent in both maryland 
and oklahoma sales were off 95 percent in the district of 
columbia 
analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a 
lastminute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits 
before the new tax law took effect on jan 1 1987 
tuccillo predicted that price increases nationwide should be 
lower than the 51 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to 
decline by around 8 percent in part because of slower economic 
growth 
tuccillo predicted that the northeast will continue to have the 
highest home prices of any region but he said the rate of increase 
should slow 
a leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated 
activity he said the losses incurred by those in the new york 
financial community are still having a lagging effect on home 
buying in that area

california first bank which is controlled 
by the bank of tokyo ltd said tuesday that it has agreed to 
acquire union bank in a deal valued at around 750 million 
the transaction represents the largest investment ever by a 
japanese bank in a california financial institution said dan 
williams an analyst for sutro amp co inc in san francisco 
theyre getting close to being a major california bank he 
said 
the deal will more than double the size of cal first to a total 
of 152 billion in assets with 167 california offices making it 
the states fifth largest commercial bank los angelesbased union 
currently is fifth trailing bank of america security pacific 
wells fargo and first interstate 
seishichi itoh president and chief executive officer of cal 
first said the bank had signed a letter of intent to acquire union 
from londonbased standard chartered plc 
bank of tokyo owns 77 percent of california first known until 
several years ago as bank of tokyo of california 
california first spokesman mike colwell said the merger makes 
a good match because union is a major business bank and cal 
first mainly serves individual consumers 
however standard amp poors corp was critical of the deal and 
placed its credit ratings of all cal first bank of tokyo and union 
bancorp of california on its creditwatch list sampp noted union 
banks narrowing margins and high overhead expenses and said 
these concerns are exacerbated by bank of tokyos relatively 
large exposure to sovereign borrowers with payment difficulties

us financial firms

shearson lehman bros inc and sumitomo bank ltd completed a

directors of the chicago board of trade voted 
tuesday to reduce daily price limits for major market index futures 
to 20 points and institutional index futures to 12 points 
the changes will become effective only if approved by the 
federal commodity futures trading commission 
a 20point move in the major market index or a 12point move in 
the institutional index represents roughly 5 percent of the 
indexes present levels 
in recommending the move cbot chairman karsten mahlmann said 
the new limits would be more consistent with those in effect on 
stock index futures traded at other exchanges 
last month the cbot set permanent daily price limits on its 
stock index futures in an attempt to curb trading volatility that 
some critics say worsened the october stock market crash

a torontobased real estate company launched a 
245 million offer tuesday for up to 14 million shares of santa fe 
southern pacific corp adding another chapter to the complicated 
fight for control of santa fe 
the offer by olympia amp york developments ltd which works out 
to 1750 a share would boost olympia amp yorks stake in santa fe 
to 199 percent 
olympia amp york which had control of 105 percent of the 
railroad and natural resources company is challenging a plan by 
henley group inc of la jolla calif to wage a proxy fight for 
control of santa fe 
i think olympia amp york are trying to make sure they have a 
controlling position in the company said isabel benham an 
analyst at printon kane in new york 
henley group is santa fes largest shareholder with 157 
percent it plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to santa fes 
proposed 47 billion restructuring plan which was seen as an 
effort to stop henleys advances 
olympia amp york supported the restructuring and its 
representatives have been nominated to two seats on the santa fe 
board 
santa fe which has about 1562 million shares outstanding said 
it has been informed of olympia amp yorks tender offer but had no 
comment spokesman richard hall said 
norm ritter a spokesman for henley group said company chairman 
michael dingman was pleased with the move but he would not 
elaborate 
under the restructuring plan santa fe shareholders would 
receive 25 in cash and 5 in subordinated debentures per share 
henley has said the debentures are another effort by santa fe to 
prevent a takeover and is challenging them in court ritter said a 
delaware chancery court has set feb 26 as the date for a 
preliminary hearing on the issue 
a debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and 
bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not 
the company issuing it makes a profit 
the olympia amp york offer which expires at midnight march 13 
hinges on payment by santa fe of a special dividend the cash part 
of which the company said it paid tuesday with the debenture 
payment set for march 1 
meanwhile moodys investors service inc citing the effects of 
the restructuring plan said it downgraded the securities ratings 
of santa fe and its subsidiaries the atchison topeka and santa fe 
railway and southern pacific co 
moodys said the downgrade was based on the substantial 
weakening in the parents debtprotection measurements because of a 
recent corporate restructuring 
about 14 billion of securities are affected 
the dividend which will result in an outlay of approximately 
39 billion will be funded primarily through proceeds from asset 
sales the senior subordinated debentures and bank debt moodys 
said 
this outlay will substantially reduce the firms equity and 
the additional 46 billion of debt will radically increase 
leverage 
the new yorkbased rating agency said santa fes ability to 
generate cash flow to meet maturing obligations depends primarily 
on an aggressive real estate divestiture program
