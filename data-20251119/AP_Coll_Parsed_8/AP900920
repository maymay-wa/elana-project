barring unforeseen calamities the jewish new 
year is looking happier than usual for israel 
the caveat about calamities is necessary 
when jews celebrate they traditionally smash a glass to remind 
themselves there is no joy without sorrow and with each puff of 
good fortune israelis listen for the tinkle of broken glass 
the persian gulf crisis the rapid thaw in israels relations 
with moscow and the influx of soviet jewish immigrants are forcing 
israelis to confront the unimaginable the sands of the middle east 
havent just shifted they have quaked 
the horizon that has opened up is unlimited and were playing 
for the whole kitty says amnon abramovitz a columnist for the 
maariv newspaper 
were at a junction of several roads and its hard to know 
right now what road well be taking this year it could lead to 
negotiations with syria or a war with saddam hussein or both 
he said 
israels steadfast lowprofile conduct in the gulf crisis has 
transformed its image from bully of the west bank to loyal ally of 
the west and relieved the pressure on jerusalem to negotiate with 
the palestinians 
still israelis worry what if iraq attacks them with chemical 
weapons there was panic buying of survival supplies last month 
and a debate is raging about whether to distribute gas masks 
soviet jewish newcomers kissing the tarmac at bengurion airport 
are a heartwarming spectacle for israelis a reminder of why they 
built a jewish state 
but can a small troubled economy pay to house and employ an 
immigrant multitude that may increase the jewish population by 50 
percent by the mid1990s 
it is a most revolutionary thing says immigration official 
simcha dinitz i know of no other society going through such a 
massive absorption process 
many of israels 7000 synagogues opened to immigrants free 
following a request by minister of religious affairs avner shaki to 
waive the fees that some synagogues impose to raise funds for 
religious work 
the new year 5751 on the jewish calendar was welcomed with the 
blowing of the rams horn known as the shofar and begins 10 days of 
introspection which culminate in yom kippur the day of atonement 
according to figures released wednesday by the central bureau of 
statistics israels jewish population grew by 39 percent since 
last rosh hashana of the 115000 new immigrants 88 percent were 
from the soviet union 
stateowned radio reports a nearly 10 percent unemployment rate 
the intefadeh the 34monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip has slowed sharply but no 
israeli imagines it is over 
once the dust has settled when the gulf has calmed down 
there will still be two peoples left in this country two people 
whose lives will become hell unless the conflict between them is 
solved by peaceful means warned peace now a grassroots israeli 
movement in a new year message 
still as they take to the synagogues beaches and picnic 
grounds for a long weekend starting wednesday night many israelis 
will agree with prime minister yitzhak shamirs assessment that 
we had a great year and were entering an even greater one 
most extraordinary is the turnaround by the soviets who had 
armed the arabs denounced zionism as nazism and persecuted 
wouldbe jewish emigrants the soviets now line up with the united 
states against iraq and entertained israeli ministers in the 
kremlin 
finance minister yitzhak modai and science minister yuval neeman 
on saturday became the first israeli cabinet ministers to meet a 
soviet leader 
asked how he felt as he walked into the kremlin to meet 
gorbachev 64yearold modai replied in awestruck tones not heard 
from israeli politicians since egyptian president anwar sadat 
landed in israel 13 years ago 
you cant even imagine it was so dramatic it was so out of 
anything that any normal human mind can conceive that i dont 
think anybody who hasnt gone through it can imagine it 
we were frozen there on our seats you sit across from 
gorbachev you can touch him you look at his face and that famous 
mark and you are able to read his mind not just to listen to 
him he said 
a year ago iraq was a distant threat jordan looked like 
israels most peaceful and responsible neighbor and syria as 
ever was israels implacable foe 
now jordan is drifting into iraqs embrace and readmitting the 
palestine liberation organization leaders it expelled 20 years ago 
while syria sends troops to join the western buildup in the gulf 
and now that the soviets no longer guarantee to bankroll syrias 
army some israelis are speculating about a tradeoff involving the 
israeliannexed golan heights a year ago the notion of peace with 
syria would have been laughed off now the jewish settlers on the 
northern golan heights are calling emergency meetings to discuss 
the prospect of an israeli withdrawal 
in saudi arabia the us military staged private services 
wednesday for jewish troops wishing to mark the holiday despite 
saudi restrictions on overt practice of any religion other than 
islam 
all these things simply make you lose your bearings says 
amnon dankner a writer and columnist for the daily hadashot

rhino ears one elephant tail and two automatic assault rifles

with a smaller one behind it 
the horns are carved into ornamental dagger handles or crushed 
into powder as an ingredient in traditional medicines in the middle 
east and asia

2000 lives in zimbabwe

to protest a new government plan to set 
aside 49 percent of federal jobs for indias most disadvantaged 
castes two college students sprinkled kerosene on their bodies and 
set themselves on fire 
rajeev goswami an undergraduate was taken to the hospital with 
severe burns after wednesdays suicide attempt outside the 
capitals deshbandhu gupta college united news of india said 
the second student was taken to the hospital but was later 
discharged news reports said he was subsequently arrested they 
said 
elsewhere in the capital graduate students blocked traffic and 
burned their college degrees to protest the job quotas 
in solan in the himalayan foothills north of new delhi at 
least 60 people were injured when opponents of the policy battled 
police united news said 
at least one person sustained bullet njuries when police opened 
fire after repeated charges failed to quell the crowd it said 
the job policy announced by prime minister vp singh on aug 
7 reserves 49 percent of all government jobs for indias most 
disadvantaged castes and another 5 to 10 percent for the poor 
irrespective of caste 
remaining jobs will be awarded on merit 
the government employs 18 million people and a whitecollar job 
is much sought after by most college graduates 
at least 25 people have died in protests by upper caste students 
since the quotas were announced they say the policy will lessen 
job opportunities heighten caste tensions and lead to the 
recruitment of unqualified people 
the government says the program will bring more social justice 
for the mainly poor lower castes 
hindus 82 percent of indias 880 million people are divided 
into four main castes or social levels and hundreds of 
subcastes although discrimination on the basis of caste is 
illegal the system permeates much of indian life especially in 
rural areas 
singhs opponents say the quotas are a political gimmick aimed 
at gathering votes from the lower castes who form a majority of 
the population

although supreme court nominee david h 
souters confirmation seems assured there still is uncertainty on 
what kind of high court justice he would be or what historic role 
he would play 
would he bolster the courts slim conservative majority or 
would souter prove to be a moderate whose pivotal vote in key cases 
might be up for grabs 
the high stakes riding on the answer to that question account 
for the intense scrutiny president bushs selection of souter 
attracted 
it would not matter who was nominated at this moment in our 
history senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden 
ddel said of the controversy swirling about souter as his 
confirmation hearings concluded wednesday 
the next justice will join a court confronting a number of 
significant decisions that are now 44 biden said 
the hearings focused on divisive issues including abortion 
civil rights churchstate relations and free speech 
where would souter fit in 
its difficult to put him in anybodys camp nan aron of the 
liberal alliance for justice said in an interview 
the difficulty in part arises from the differences between 
souters record of public service and the testimony he offered in 
three days before bidens committee 
his appearance undermined prehearing beliefs some held that the 
nominee a lifelong bachelor is some kind of bookish hermit with 
no friends or reallife experiences 
several of souters best friends took him out for a 51st 
birthday party the day he finished testifying the next night he 
traveled to baltimore to watch a major league baseball game 
ms aron said souters views on womens rights make him sound 
like conservative chief justice william h rehnquist and his views 
on churchstate relations like slightly less conservative justice 
sandra day oconnor 
he doesnt seem to be another justice antonin scalia who 
has the clearest conservative agenda ms aron said on civil 
rights people are hoping he is a moderate retired justice lewis 
f powell 
thomas jipping of the conservative coalitions for america 
likened souter to another member of the court justice anthony m 
kennedy 
while scalia is a welldeveloped philosophical conservative 
souter more resembles kennedy in that hes a prudent instinctive 
conservative jipping said in an interview 
in nearly three years on the court kennedy has sided with 
rehnquist in about 90 percent of all cases are liberals facing a 
similar performance by a justice souter i hope so said 
jipping theyre certainly going to have some sleepless nights 
some predict souter whose nomination likely will be voted on by 
the judiciary committee a week from today may betray the 
conservative credentials he earned in 12 years as a new hampshire 
judge 
griffin bell the democrat who served as attorney general in 
jimmy carters administration called souter rather moderate in 
endorsing his nomination 
former virginia gov gerald baliles called him moderate in 
tone and expression and suggested that he might emulate retired 
justice powell 
but sara rios of the center for constitutional rights who 
wednesday urged the senate to reject souter called his 
moderatesounding testimony a confirmation conversion 
he bandied about liberal rhetoric with great facility but 
his record does not hold out much hope he will vote that way ms 
rios said 
testifying in another context souters longtime friend wesley 
williams a washington lawyer uttered a question appropriate to 
the souter guessing game who can read the heart of a man

george washington was barely into his second 
year as president when the government slapped a tax on whiskey 
cigarettes were targeted during the civil war furs and other 
luxuries were taxed to help finance world war i 
now congress and the bush administration are eyeing those 
products and others in the search for revenues with which to fight 
a new war the longrunning battle against the budget deficit 
despite lingering disagreement over several deficitreduction 
proposals chiefly president bushs plan to cut taxes on capital 
gains negotiators for congress and the white house have agreed 
tentatively on a halfdozen tax increases that would affect million 
of americans 
the federal government faces 100 billion worth of arbitrary 
cuts in most programs oct 1 barely a month before elections 
unless a deficit reduction plan can be enacted 
the leaders have agreed tentatively to these tax increases 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they want to restore an old standby the luxury tax whose 
last remnants were repealed in 1965 the world war i version 
applied to jewelry furs cosmetics and luggage the proposal would 
redefine luxuries to accommodate the electronics age 
specifically the plan would raise 9 billion over the next five 
years by imposing a 10 percent levy on part of the cost of certain 
luxuries the tax would apply only to the portion of the purchase 
price that exceeds 30000 for cars and boats 1000 for 
electronics 5000 for jewelry and 500 for furs the tax would 
hit private planes under 5000 pounds regardless of price 
for example the buyer of a 32000 car would have to pay a 200 
tax a 2000 stereo system would cost an extra 100

the budgetwriters agree that energy taxes should be increased 
but there is no agreement on specifics democrats are seeking a 
higher and broader tax on most energy costing consumers 49 
billion over five years the gop plan would cost 7 billion 
regardless of which side prevails one result will be higher 
prices on gasoline and home heating oil 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
airline passengers and cargo shippers would feel the pinch if 
the budget agreement becomes law negotiators have accepted an 
administration plan to keep several air taxes from dropping as 
scheduled at yearend and to raise some of them 
this would mean for example that the 8 percent tax on 
passenger tickets would rise to 10 percent a 500 roundtrip 
ticket would cost 10 more 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the tax on a pack of cigarettes would rise by 4 cents to 20 
cents next year and by an additional 4 cents in 1993 this would 
cost smokers 59 billion over five years 
the tobacco tax was raised from 7 cents to 8 cents in 1951 and 
stayed at that level until it was doubled in 1983 republicans 
especially are wary of raising the tax this year because two gop 
senators from tobacco states jesse helms of north carolina and 
mitch mcconnell of kentucky are in tight reelection races

federal taxes on wine and beer remain at 1951 levels although 
the tax on liquor was raised in 1951 and again in 1985 while 
negotiators have not said exactly how it will be done they have 
agreed to tax drinkers an extra 136 billion over the next five 
years 
the plan is expected to increase taxes somewhat less than an 
earlier proposal which for example would have raised the 196 
tax on a fifth of 80proof vodka to 254 the 16cent tax on a 
sixpack of beer to 81 cents and the 3cent levy on a 
750milliliter bottle of table wine to 76 cents 
however rankandfile members of both parties are getting 
nervous about the budget negotiations which moved back to the 
capitol this week after 10 days of talks at andrews air force base 
ended in stalemate 
there is very little sentiment for continuing on this path for 
budget summit meetings that go nowhere rep richard durbin 
dill said after meeting with other grumbling democrats on 
wednesday 
they should junk the budget summit added rep dan burton 
rill 
nonleadership members of both parties already have begun trying 
to come up with their own separate proposals for reducing the 
deficit

illinois is witnessing a political role 
reversal this fall in the campaign for governor a democrat running 
as a taxcutting budgetslashing fiscal conservative and a 
republican under attack as a taxandspend liberal 
republican jim edgar has found himself on the defensive against 
democrat neil hartigans antitax rhetoric and recent polls have 
indicated the race is virtually a dead heat 
edgar has got to find a way to deal with the tax issue says 
political scientist paul green of governors state university it 
could sink him its more than a oneshot issue its the dominant 
issue 
edgar is a former state lawmaker and aide to fourterm gov 
james r thompson the longestserving governor in illinois history 
is not seeking reelection 
the campaigns pivotal tax issue is whether to extend a 
twoyear 20 percent income tax increase that provides money to 
schools and local governments and is set to expire next july 
both candidates supported the tax increase last year and soon 
after its passage edgar said it should be made permanent but 
hartigan now wants to scrap the portion earmarked for local 
government hedges on continuing the education levy and is 
hammering edgar as a free spender quick to resort to higher taxes 
the 52yearold hartigan was launched into statewide politics in 
the early 1970s by the late chicago mayor richard j daley hardly 
a boatrocker but hartigans campaign for governor has taken a 
classic outsideragainsttheestablishment tack railing against 
bureaucratic bloat and favoritism toward political insiders under 
thompson 
its time for a change after 14 years of jim thompson and jim 
edgar hartigans current television commercial declares edgar 
spent a decade as illinois secretary of state 
edgar 44 entered the race as the betterknown candidate both 
for a highprofile campaign against drunken driving and because his 
signature appears on every drivers license and vehicle 
registration in the state 
but his stance on the temporary tax and his prochoice position 
on abortion rankled conservatives and spurred a challenge in the 
gop primary though edgar won the contest tapped his resources and 
began an antitax drumbeat that hartigan has continued 
edgars response has been a campaign stressing character and 
candor the latter a lessthanveiled effort to disavow the 
thompson record of seeking tax increases after election campaigns 
in which he downplayed any need for higher taxes 
by being straight with you before the election edgar said 
in a recent television ad therell be no surprises after the 
election 
political observers say edgars cause was hurt when the state 
supreme court struck from the ballot a proposed state 
constitutional amendment designed to make it more difficult for the 
general assembly to increase taxes republicans had counted on the 
measure to boost turnout particularly in chicagos suburbs 
our people were waiting in the wings couldnt wait to get to 
the ballot box in november said gop state sen judy baar 
topinka whose district in chicagos western suburbs has been a 
hotbed of antitax sentiment 
hartigans vulnerability could lie in chicagos black community 
black candidates have been rebuffed repeatedly since the death of 
the late mayor harold washington whose 1987 reelection bid 
hartigan opposed edgar has gained a few endorsements from black 
leaders and a thirdparty slate running for local office under 
washingtons name poses the threat of a split in a key democratic 
voting bloc 
looming over the race is next years legislative and 
congressional reapportionment republicans have all but conceded 
that democrats this fall will retain control of the state house and 
senate which will draft the reapportionment map and a hartigan 
victory would cement democrats control of the process 
edgar says he would veto a map skewed in favor of democrats an 
action that would throw the issue to a bipartisan commission his 
potentially pivotal role in reapportionment has helped solidify 
support among gop politicians who disagree with him on taxes 
we need a governor who will get in there and do the right 
thing and veto the map said state senate republican leader 
james pate philip who opposed the temporary tax

danger pay of 110 a month for them retroactive to sept 1 
in recognition of the sacrifices our military men and women 
are making i have directed the payment of this supplemental 
benefit to the troops on the front lines cheney said this is 
an appropriate step given the risks they face and the harsh 
conditions in which they serve

benefits for the troops noting complaints from soldiers in saudi 
arabia that they lost their subsistence pay of about 150 a month 
when they were shipped out of their home bases

subsistence pay

units the army said it had alerted 24 other reserve units in 13 
states and puerto rico that they may be activated

the federal aviation administration is ready 
to cut commercial air traffic at 41 airports by thousands of 
flights a day if mandatory budget cutbacks take effect oct 1 
air security and aircraft maintenance inspections also would be 
trimmed the agency said 
under the terms of the grammrudman deficit reduction act the 
budget cuts will occur automatically unless white house and 
congressional negotiators reach a compromise agreement before oct 
1 the start of the 1991 fiscal year 
a spokesman for the airline industry said the reductions would 
prove terribly disruptive 
the aim of an emergency contingency plan issued wednesday is to 
keep the number of daily flights at a level that the faas reduced 
force of air traffic controllers could safely handle 
the faa said the 40000 flights that are normally handled by the 
41 airports on an average day would be cut by 6000 it said 
cancellations and delays could rise dramatically during bad 
weather 
smaller airports also are likely to be affected when flights to 
and from the larger airports are canceled the faa said 
the grammrudman reductions would cut deeply into the muscle 
of the federal aviation administration as well as other government 
agencies said faa administrator james b busey 
robert j aaronson president of the air transport association 
which represents the nations major air carriers said the plan 
will force drastic cuts 
the proposed reduction will be terribly disruptive to the 
nations air transport system its passengers and shippers 
aaronson said contending the situation illustrates that faas air 
control functions cannot be operated efficiently as long as the 
agency is the captive of the federal civil service and budget 
systems 
but he said the possibility that cutbacks will take effect is 
real and that airlines have already begun planning to deal with it 
the faa said that if the budget cuts take hold it would have to 
furlough each of its 17200 controllers for two days every two

with the mideast crisis dramatizing the 
countrys heavy reliance on foreign oil americas love for gas 
guzzling cars is again coming under attack and detroit is 
scrambling to control the damage 
the senate is scheduled to take up legislation monday on whether 
to require automakers to boost average fuel economy to 40 miles per 
gallon a 40 percent increase 
in the house sponsors of a similar bill are threatening to make 
an end run around the energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich strongly opposes tougher car 
mileage requirements and push the bill directly on the house 
floor 
the fuel economy measure once was given only scant chance but 
industry lobbyists and members of the bush administration now say 
theyre concerned the measure may sneak through as congress 
searches for ways to reduce oil consumption 
the nations transportation system and to a great extent the 
automobile accounts for 60 percent of americas energy needs 
said sen richard bryan dnev sponsor of the senate bill he 
said that if a 40milespergallon car were in common use it would 
save 28 million barrels of oil a day 
the rumblings on capitol hill over auto fuel economy have caught 
the automakers at a particularly bad time with gasoline relatively 
inexpensive before the latest persian gulf crisis the 
manufacturers have been pushing performance over fuel economy when 
planning future product lines 
these plans would have to change dramatically under bryans 
bill 
the measure would cause economic disaster to the industry 
and force automakers to retool production lines to meet the new 
fuel efficiency requirements said thomas hanna president of the 
motor vehicle manufacturers association which is leading the fight 
against the senate bill 
as the bills prospects have risen so have the voices on both 
sides of the issue 
it should be called the highway fatality bill 
transportation secretary samuel skinner told a news conference in 
denouncing the legislation if passed he said the measure would 
lead to smaller cars and more traffic deaths 
skinner said he would recommend that president bush veto the 
bill he said he is concerned the near hysteria over the 
mideast situation may propel the legislation through congress even 
though he insisted the mileage goals are unrealistic 
irresponsible and more important unattainable 
but environmentalists say skinner is being taken in by the 
automakers who contend they lack the technology to improve fuel 
efficiency dramatically after years of making cars lighter smaller 
and more efficient 
since 1975 the average fuel economy of cars sold in the united 
states has doubled from about 14 mpg to 28 mpg a third of all 
models now get more than 30 mpg 
further improvements in automakers fleetwide average the 
manufacturers say would mean restricting buyers to compacts 
were at a different plateau now than we were in 1975 said 
albert slechter government affairs director for chrysler corp 
fifteen years ago he acknowledged cars were too heavy and were 
not designed to save gas 
such technologies as improved aerodynamic design frontwheel 
drive improved transmissions fuel injection and smaller more 
efficient engines are already being used in many cars without 
approaching the 40 mpg level of performance the automakers argue 
there is no secret or magic technology on the shelf to 
drastically increase fuel economy said hanna of the industry 
trade association 
not true argued bryan he has accumulated his own folder of 
studies that he said prove that cars can meet his bills 
requirements if automakers are ordered to he scoffed at 
suggestions that cars would have to become much smaller 
the studies cited by bryan contend there are changes in 
transmissions tires engine designs and fuel injection systems 
as well as improved aerodynamics that could significantly improve 
fuel economy and maintain a selection of car sizes 
deborah lynn bleviss executive director of the international 
institute for energy conservation said manufacturers have 
developed a halfdozen prototypes that average 60 to 75 mpg 
environmentalists accuse the automakers of pushing 
highperformance muscle cars over fuel efficiency detroits 
1991 model line includes a number of heavy highperformance models 
such as general motors revival of the buick roadmaster its v8 
engine gets 16 mpg in city driving 
its hard for me to believe that any patriotic american would 
buy a roadmaster with american boys sitting in the desert rep 
george miller dcalif a sponsor of the house bill said 
wednesday at a hearing on the bill 
but dingell took issue with the link between fuel economy and 
the mideast crisis he noted that it could take until at least 2005 
for the bill to achieve major oil savings 
do we have reason to assume that the persian gulf crisis is 
going to wait until 2005 he asked

the federal communications commission says 
its giving longdistance telephone users a nice surprise lower 
phone bills 
but consumer and business groups are suspicious 
the commission said wednesday it was extending its price cap 
regulatory regime to the interstate longdistance earnings of the 
eight largest local phone companies 
the fcc said the new regulations on local companies could save 
customers billions over the next four years last year the 
commission replaced the 20yearold rate of return regulation 
of the largest longdistance company american telephone amp 
telegraph co with price caps 
previous commission decisions have largely been responsible for 
the 40 percent drop in longdistance prices since 1984 
but brian moir an attorney representing the 730member 
international communications association said the fcc this time 
didnt provide statistics to back up its savings claims as it voted 
40 to impose price caps 
in the past the commission was quick to announce what the 
benefit would be for ratepayers although weve found those not to 
be correct moir said they didnt do that today they did not 
say that this plan would produce x dollars of benefit over 
the next four years thats disturbing 
gene kimmelman legislative director of the consumer federation 
of america said the changes were a godsend for local phone 
companies 
were going to see longdistance rates actually rise for the 
first time in a long time because of the reduced regulation of the 
local carriers kimmelman said well probably see their 
profits rise as a result 
the rules which go into effect jan 1 reduce the rates local 
phone companies charge for interstate services such as levies for 
connecting longdistance companies with the local phone network 
lower charges to the longdistance companies will mean reduced 
charges for longdistance customers the fcc said 
adoption of this regulatory reform is expected to reduce 
longdistance rates by billions of dollars over the next four 
years yet permit higher profits provided the local phone 
companies can become more efficient the fcc said 
the plan first proposed in 1987 has gone through several major 
modifications after critics complained that phone companies 
benefited too much there has been strong opposition to the plan on 
capitol hill 
the commission argues that regulating the prices phone companies 
charge rather than their profits will give the companies an 
incentive to lower their own costs or increase customer demand and 
thereby increase their profits beyond what they could earn under 
rate of return 
complicated formulas that allow the companies to raise prices at 
the rate of inflation minus a productivity factor offset that 
compensates for lower costs of producing phone service are 
designed to assure that there are real price reductions 
the local companies also will be required to share with 
customers profits beyond a specified percentage gain if the 
company gets too profitable it would have to return all its 
profits to customers 
commissioner ervin duggan concurred in part and dissented in 
part saying he feared prices would go up under the profitsharing 
provision 
the rules will apply only to the seven regional bell operating 
companies and gte the seven bells are ameritech bell atlantic 
bellsouth nynex pacific telesis southwestern bell and us west 
the commission said there should be an immediate 317 million 
price cut at the eight largest local companies jan 1 
smaller phone companies will be given the option of adopting 
price caps while the fcc further studies whether to make the price 
caps mandatory for all companies 
in the meantime the interstate revenues of smaller companies 
will continue to be regulated under traditional rate of return 
regulation which allows companies to earn a certain percentage 
beyond the costs of their investments 
the fcc voted wednesday to lower the rate of return from 12 
percent to 1125 percent 
john sodolski president of the united states telephone 
association decried the reduction saying it will discourage 
investments to improve the phone network

the recession of 1990 if it comes could be 
longer and deeper than expected because of a tough antiinflation 
stance being taken by the federal reserve some economists contend 
these analysts believe that was the message federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan delivered to congress on wednesday when he 
talked about new and substantial risks to the us economy from 
the rise in oil prices after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
greenspan gave no indication that the central bank was on the 
verge of pushing interest rates lower he said the economy was 
facing threats both from rising inflationary pressures and a 
possible recession 
the comments disappointed the bush administration and financial 
markets which had been hoping the fed chief would emphasize 
recession risks and signal a willingness to ease credit conditions 
to avert or at least lessen the severity of what would be the 
countrys first economic slump in eight years 
many analysts said greenspans comments sounded remarkably like 
the views being expressed by central bank officials in such 
countries as japan and west germany officials there have said they 
viewed the inflationary threats from the oil price shock as the 
greater threat 
central bank officials seem determined not to repeat the same 
mistakes they made in the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979 said 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new york 
securities dealer 
in each of those cases they panicked over the thought of a 
recession and eased too soon before they had snuffed out 
inflation jones said 
jones said he originally believed the country was headed for a 
recession but that it would be a mild one beginning in the fourth 
quarter of this year and lasting through the winter 
but after greenspans comments he said the downturn was likely 
to be more severe and last for a full year because he believes the 
fed has decided to postpone any easing moves while it tries to get 
inflation down 
if the fed waits to ease the recession will be both longer 
and deeper jones said 
other economists said they also were looking for a downturn to 
begin in the octoberdecember quarter this year but they were 
split on how severe it will be 
we are looking for a mild recession lasting about two quarters 
unless the middle east blows up said david wyss senior 
financial economist at drimcgraw hill but that forecast is very 
iffy depending on what happens in the middle east 
during his testimony before the congressional joint economic 
committee greenspan rejected suggestions that the fed was in 
effect being held hostage by iraqi president saddam hussein 
while he conceded that the feds job of promoting 
noninflationary growth had been made more difficult by events in 
the persian gulf greenspan insisted that there still were tools 
the central bank could employ to mitigate the fallout 
but private economists said greenspans generally gloomy report 
on economic prospects reflected the tough choices facing the fed 
normally rising unemployment and the current widespread economic 
weakness would prompt the fed to lower interest rates to spur 
economic activity 
but the oil price shock means the country is experiencing the 
worst bout of inflation in nine years according to a government 
report on consumer prices released tuesday 
the fed is in a real bind said bruce steinberg economist 
at merrill lynch in new york it would like to ease because the 
economy is rapidly weakening but at the same time inflation is 
rapidly accelerating 
greenspans comments represented a setback for the bush 
administration the administration has been lobbying for months for 
the fed to lower interest rates in an effort to avert the first 
economic downturn since the 198182 recession 
greenspan insisted that the economy is still growing although 
at a very slow pace but he said the risks of a recession had 
increased since aug 2 
regrettably events in the middle east have introduced new and 
substantial risks to the outlook greenspan said 
in a report emphasizing the weakness the fed on wednesday 
released a review of economic conditions in various parts of the 
country the fed report said that economic activity in the feds 12 
regions was either expanding more slowly or actually declining 
weakness is most apparent in the northeastern and midatlantic 
districts the report said

the house is on a collision course with the 
senate over the b2 stealth bomber and other vast differences in 
their versions of the fiscal 1991 defense bill 
theres a couple of sticking points clearly the b2 is a big 
one rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said after wednesdays house action 
by a partyline vote of 256155 the house approved a 283 
billion defense bill that stops production of the b2 bomber at the 
15 planes in development and slashes 24 billion from president 
bushs request for the strategic defense initiative commonly known 
as star wars 
the senate in approving its defense blueprint last month 
adopted a 289 billion bill that makes no change in the 
administrations plan for the b2 and trims about 1 billion from 
sdi 
negotiators for the house and senate will meet later this month 
in the hope of finding some common ground in their widely divergent 
bills and then producing a package acceptable to the president 
moments before the final house vote rep bill dickinson of 
alabama ranking republican on the armed services panel said 
defense secretary dick cheney vowed to recommend a veto of the 
house measure 
dickinson also was sharply critical of the final legislation 
with democrat defense bills like this saddam hussein should 
have waited another couple of years before invading kuwait that 
way we wouldnt have had the men or machines to oppose him he 
said 
aspin and other democrats shared a different perspective of the 
package 
the bill provides for a military still primarily sized and 
shaped to meet the soviet threat but it takes the first steps 
toward buying the right defense for a new era aspin said 
first on the agenda for members of the house and senate armed 
services committees who will take part in the conference is an 
overall spending total for defense 
that number will be decided by white house and congressional 
negotiators hammering out an agreement on how to pare 50 billion 
from the federal deficit in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the most contentious issue for defense bargainers will be the 
b2 bomber 
bush had sought 46 billion for two of the batwinged planes 
and advanced procurement of parts for six more in fiscal 1992 the 
senate concurred with his proposal 
but the house approved ending production of the aircraft the 
costliest in history at nearly 865 million a plane after the 15 
bombers already under construction are completed 
acknowledging the inevitable proponents of the aircraft debated 
the issue but did call for a vote 
were in an awfully strong position that they didnt even want 
to offer an amendment aspin said noting that measures are not 
offered because you think youre going to get killed 
the senate narrowly turned aside attempts to cancel the b2 
which has the strong upport of sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee 
house members will likely reject anything other than the action 
they took on the bomber 
on the issue of sdi the negotiators are expected to split the 
difference between the two numbers 37 billion in the senate and 
23 billion in the house 
but its unclear whether approximately 3 billion for the 
program in fiscal 1991 will be acceptable to the administration 
bargainers also must contend with the difficult issues of base 
closings mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and cuts in military 
personnel the house approved a 129500 reduction in the nations 
21 million troops while the senate agreed to 100000 
the administration proposed 38000 in fiscal 1991

president bushs son neil faces a public 
hearing next week on the governments conflictofinterest charges 
against him but a final decision in the case wont be made until 
next spring 
the administrative law judge presiding over the case has several 
options including recommending a stronger charge against bush than 
the one proposed by federal regulators a government attorney said 
wednesday 
bush 35 was a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association a denver thrift that failed in november 1988 at an 
estimated cost to taxpayers of 1 billion bush resigned in august 
1988 just after his father received the republican presidential 
nomination 
the office of thrift supervision is seeking an order against 
bush that effectively could bar him from working for a bank or a 
savings and loan 
the agency contends bush failed to adequately disclose to 
silverado his business relationships with developers kenneth m 
good and bill l walters two big borrowers from the institution 
bush has denied any wrongdoing 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson wont make an 
immediate decision on the case after the hearing that begins 
tuesday in denver ots chief counsel harris weinstein told 
reporters at a briefing 
davidson is expectedt we have as much at stake 
as we did in world war ii kerrey said in a floor speech 
in his appearance on capitol hill eagleburger said it is only 
reasonable that the united states approach allies who benefit from 
the defense of middle east oil fields and ask them to help shoulder 
the cost 
i know it creates some constitutional problems were going to 
have to sort through he told subcommittee chairman rep david 
obey dwis but on the other hand i dont think you would knock 
us for going around the world and trying to tell the other 
beneficiaries that we ought not to have to pay for all of this 
ourselves 
so far eagleburger said the gulf states have pledged 12 
billion japan 4 billion germany 2 billion and the european 
community 2 billion 
obey agreed that allies should share the cost but attacked 
bushs request to set up a national defense gift fund as one 
of the most spectacular end runs on the constitution i have 
ever witnessed 
in separate votes the full house and its appropriations defense 
subcommittee moved to require that any money raised from allies be 
spent only by congress 
the defense subcommittee took its action as it moved ahead with 
bushs request for an additional 19 billion to pay for the gulf 
military mobilization in the current fiscal year which ends sept 
30 
eagleburger argued wednesday that congress should approve the 
cancellation of egypts 67 billion in military debt saying 
cairos already weak economy is suffering a 37 billion added 
shock from the gulf crisis 
he said bush feels strongly that the gesture was important as a 
public show of support for egypt and for president hosni mubarak 
members of congress have voiced appreciation for mubaraks 
leadership but also are wary of the size of the reward at a time 
when budget cutters are being forced to hack away at favorite 
domestic programs 
eagleburger said israel whose foreign aid package has 
traditionally been linked to the size of egypts also would be 
getting more from the united states

sen larry pressler is misleading voters with 
a television commercial that claims he has maintained one of the 
senates best attendance records says democratic challenger ted 
muenster 
the south dakota republicans attendance record in the past two 
years is among the senates best he never missed a rollcall vote 
in 1989 
however his average voting record since winning his seat in 
1978 is one of the senates worst muenster said 
congressional records show that he has made marked improvements 
in attendance in years just before facing reelection 
pressler has answered 906 percent of the senates rollcall 
votes since 1979 ranking him 49th among the 54 senators who have 
been in office since then according to muensters compilation of 
attendance records 
pressler was criticized during his 1984 reelection campaign for 
his poor attendance record during his first years in the senate 
and he said wednesday he has kept his promise to improve 
the commercial was intended to deflect the kinds of attacks he 
received six years ago he said 
my commercial refers to the fact that ive improved my voting

mayor david dinkins has accused the census 
bureau of skipping one out of every 13 housing units and missing up 
to 1 million residents in its preliminary 1990 count of the citys 
population 
dinkins said wednesday the city is filing a challenge to the 
governments figures federal aid and representation in congress 
are determined by the census count 
the 1990 undercount could cost us up to 1 billion in lost 
federal aid or 150 for each man woman and child living in our 
city he said dinkins also said the count could cost the city at 
least one seat in congress 
the mayor said the census bureau failed to count 254534 housing 
units undercounting the citys population by 800000 to 1 million 
the bureau counted 7033 million people in the city the 
department of city planning estimates 8 million people live in the 
city 
it is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for 
the census bureau to claim that a city whose resident birth rate 
has risen by at least 23 percent and which has welcomed more than 
800000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has 
actually lost population the mayor said 
the city was given 15 business days to review the bureaus 1990 
preliminary figures it did so by analyzing data from the city con 
edison and the new york telephone co as well as consulting 
surveys atlases and aerial photographs 
in his letter to sheila grimm regional director of the census 
bureau dinkins asked that the bureau review some 11900 city 
blocks approximately 43 percent of the citys more than 28000 
residential blocks 
the bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the citys 
challenge 
in a threeblock area in one section of queens the city counted 
567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of oneand 
twofamily homes the census bureau counted zero units 
neighborhoods with minority populations in general tended to 
be undercounted by the bureau said richard schaffer director of 
the department of city planning and chairman of the city planning 
commission 
dinkins said the 1980 undercount put by the census bureau at 
450000 cost new york city some 675 million in federal aid during 
the ensuing 10 years

the bulk of iraqi forces in kuwait 
appear to be poor confused teenagers but crack republican guards 
are tightening their control over the city kuwaitis fleeing their 
country say 
refugees interviewed over the past few days at this border 
crossing said iraqi troops were becoming increasingly violent in 
their campaign to force kuwaitis to accept iraqi occupation 
checkpoints every 900 feet are now controlled by at least one 
republican guard who makes sure that searches are thorough 
neighborhood searches have also become more intense with whole 
areas completely cut off with six or eight roadblocks as up to 20 
soldiers comb each house said the refugees who generally spoke on 
condition of anonymity to protect family members left behind from 
possible retribution 
about 500 refugees arrived wednesday a sharp drop from the more 
than 6000 who had poured across the border since saturday when 
iraq opened it for the first time in more than a month 
the numbers tumbled monday when iraqi troops began grabbing men 
under 40 at random from cars trying to cross those crossing 
wednesday were old men women and children 
reports of rape even against kuwait women had climbed 
a flier distributed in kuwait on sunday warned that anyone 
shooting a gun would be executed and any house from which a gun is 
fired would be torn down as would neighboring homes 
the iraqis are already carrying out the threat with former army 
or police officers and suspected resistance members disappearing 
and turning up dead the refugees said 
they seem to like blood this is really a bloody regime 
said faisal a 27yearold computer programmer 
but each checkpoint seems to be operating under a different set 
of rules in terms of the questions iraqi soldiers ask said a 
kuwaiti defense department official who visited his country last 
week 
they seem to lack stable or strict instructions he said 
refugees said the iraqi troops were constantly conducting 
maneuvers 
iraq was attempting to engender respect in kuwait for president 
saddam ussein who has annexed the oilrich emirate 
the seaside corniche was hung every few yards with his portrait 
and friday prayer leaders were told to put in a good word about him 
in their sermons 
when they refused and concentrated on prayers for salvation 
prayer sermons were canceled the refugees said 
the iraqi troops are grabbing as many consumer goods as they 
can refugees said either by outright theft or extortion 
at a checkpoint for example an iraqi soldier might drop a 
bullet into a cars trunk and accuse the driver of being a member 
of the resistance the driver hands over a watch or some cigarettes 
and the accusation is dropped 
if your car breaks down or you run out of gas and you have to 
leave it you can forget about the tires and engine said a 
22yearold student 
you feel everybody among the iraqi troops is poor and badly 
fed said a prominent economist who fled monday they beg for 
food and water 
iraqi forces have slaughtered most of the horses in kuwait and 
even zoo animals for food the refugees said the iraqi army was 
also trying to take control of all privaterun supermarkets in 
kuwait 
the student said the combatreadiness of the iraqis was 
questionable with many of the teenage soldiers appearing fearful 
of entering neighborhoods where soldiers had been shot at 
its obvious they are frightened the iraqi soldiers are 
respected too much in the eyes of the world he said 
the bulk of iraqi troops seem to be about 16 years old poor and 
still befuddled about what they are doing in kuwait refugees said 
the adolescent soldiers repeatedly tell kuwaits that they had 
been instructed before the aug 2 invasion that they were moving 
into kuwait for maneuvers with other arab armies to prepare for an 
attack on israel 
not all iraqi troops are not hostile the kuwaitis said 
sometimes if i am nice with them they are nice with me 
said the economist they say i am arab islamic like you

hiccups keep plaguing a computer 
aboard the magellan spacecraft which nevertheless has completed 
more than 30 consecutive orbits making radar pictures of 
cloudcovered venus nasa says 
the pesky malfunctions are in the backup computer that helps 
point the orbiter 
the same computer one of four aboard magellan played a major 
role when engineers lost contact with the spacecraft aug 16 and 
again on aug 21 although the precise cause of those incidents 
remains unknown 
despite the glitches the spacecraft on wednesday morning 
completed its 30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked volcanic 
landscape of venus magellan which arrived at venus on aug 10 is 
making almost eight orbits daily it began its mapping mission on 
saturday 
since venus is almost the same size as earth the 30orbit 
image patch would drape an area on earth extending from los 
angeles to albuquerque and from the north pole to nearly the south 
pole nasa said in a statement 
pictures released in past weeks have shown long ridges and 
valleys networks of faults large flows of solidified lava and 
volcanic craters 
the most recent glitch happened monday when the backup to 
magellans main computer got a set of false alerts from the backup 
pointing computer the spacecraft wasnt operating on either backup 
computer so mapping continued 
other glitches happened just after magellan reached venus then 
again on sept 4 
engineers nicknamed the malfunctions hiccups said steve 
wall magellan experiment representative at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
magellan traveled a looping 948millionmile path to venus 
after being launched from the shuttle atlantis in may 1989 
magellan and venus are now almost 156 million miles from earth

president bushs promised line in 
the sand defense of saudi arabia is anything but linear troops 
are scattered in clumps near highways potential desert tank routes 
and the kingdoms oil fields 
from these carefully chosen locations the us military 
commander believes he could fight a mobile desert war 
but there is also concern about sustaining troops and equipment 
in such configurations given the regions harsh conditions 
the united states has exercised troops in the middle east but 
never fought a war in the region history is its guide 
look at rommel look at north africa the arabisraeli wars 
and all the rest of them army gen h norman schwarzkopf the 
commander of us forces in saudi arabia said in an interview last 
week 
a war in the desert is a war of mobility and lethality 
schwarzkopf said its not a war of straight lines drawn in the 
sand where you dig in and say i will defend here or die most 
people who do that die 
the marines and the army are splitting the burden of forming the 
defensive clusters 
marines are guarding the northsouth coastal highway into saudi 
arabia from kuwait and also the kingdoms oil fields and support 
facilities not far from the coast 
those would be the major prize if iraq were to invade but the 
united states has positioned a sizebable ground force and arranged 
for airtoground support that would make if difficult for iraq to 
move down the coastal roads 
saddam husseins just got to look around and say to himself 
im over my head marine maj gen royal n moore jr said 
recently when asked about the size of the deployment 
saddams other option for a ground invasion would be inland over 
the desert where arab forces form the front lines and heavy 
american ground forces are beginning o fan out behind them in 
defensive formations 
the m1 tanks and heavy artillery of the 24th and 197th 
mechanized infantries are the backbone of these forces and several 
more heavy units are en route 
smaller more mobile vehicles carrying tow antitank missiles 
and other weapons also are becoming a more common sight across 
certain areas of the desert these units are drilled in speeding 
toward oncoming tanks firing at them and rushing back to base 
camps to rearm for more combat attack helicopters with antitank 
systems would be deployed to do much of the same from the air 
there are vast stretches between some of the american camps but 
us planners say the more mobile of the ground forces would have 
time to reach these areas if saddam chose them for a route of 
attack 
they consider such a decision unlikely because these open areas 
generally are locations us commanders believe iraq would have 
difficulty supplying with fuel and ammunition 
sustainability also is a question high in the minds of the 
american commanders some spare parts fuel trucks and other 
supplies are still hard to come by 
the m1s and other equipment are being used as little as 
possible because of the shortages 
were being very careful what we do with the equipment said 
gen barry mccaffrey commander ofthe 24th infantry it will be a 
tremendous challenge to build the logistics system needed for 
maintenance management and parts distribution 7000 miles from 
home 
to help sustain the force national guard and reserve units are 
being brought in to convert salt water to drinking water and 
provide transportation and other support services that would be 
crucial if fighting breaks out

in many ways british prime minister 
margaret thatchers first visit this week to two new east european 
democracies czechoslovakia and hungary was like a family reunion 
she hailed both for their bloodless revolutions which ended 
decades of communist rule and led to elections this year that 
installed the countries first democratic governments in more than 
40 years 
they had she declared returned once more to their rightful 
place in europe 
but mrs thatcher who traveling to switzerland today on the 
last leg of a sixday trip singled out for special attention 
hungarys prime minister joszef antall he is the only true 
political soulmate the upheaval in eastern europe has produced for 
the british conservative party leader 
we believe in the same things and act on our beliefs she 
told antall who has seen inflation hit 25 percent to 30 percent 
and unemployment rise under his centerright government headed by 
his democratic forum party 
the fact that you are the only conservative government in 
eastern europe merits topmost consideration she said 
mrs thatcher seemed less at ease perched on a stool in a prague 
coffee bar at 10 oclock in the morning with czechoslovakias 
vaclav havel 
the playwright turned president joked and laughed and had a 
beer mrs thatcher smiled politely and had a coffee 
in hungary during a 1984 trip under communist rule shed been 
through the usual stuff of official visits rounds of 
wreathlaying handshaking banquets walkabouts political talks 
and news conferences 
this time everything was different 
if the hungarian guards of honor looked a shade drab in green 
fatigues it was because they have abandoned their sovietstyle 
uniforms and red stars and the new uniforms are still being 
designed 
in prague a square she named after winston churchill at a small 
ceremony formerly bore the name of a communist party general 
secretary antonin zapotocky 
in 1984 the nearest she got to a whiff of private enterprise 
was a budapest street market 
this time she toured budapests fledgling stock exchange the 
first in the east bloc in more than four decades it trades just 
one hour a day has fewer than 50 members and is having a tough 
time getting hungarians to buy shares 
small is beautiful commented a hungarian official showing 
her around 
well its start replied mrs thatcher its really 
wonderful to see it done this way you are ahead of moscow 
in a similar vein she interrupted her husband denis when he 
sought production figures from one of hungarys new entrepreneurs 
a former olympic gold javelin gold medallist miklos nemeth 
nemeth has set up a javelinmanufacturing company 
you musnt ask question like that hes only just started 
she interjected come back in three or four years time and hell 
tell you

shortly after the daughter of colombias 
ambassador to canada was abducted armed men kidnapped a journalist 
whose family owns the countrys leading newspaper and shot his 
chauffeur to death police said 
it was not immediately known if drug traffickers who are at war 
with the government were responsible for wednesdays abductions 
the newspaper la prensa reported wednesday that the medellin 
cocaine cartel had abducted the six journalists missing since aug 
30 
it said the six were taken in a bid to pressure the government 
into negotiating the terms under which drug traffickers could be 
tried in colombia 
la prensa said it received the information from a cartel 
spokesman 
the journalists including diana turbay daughter of former 
president julio cesar turbay disappeared on their way to interview 
a guerrilla leader in the countryside 
the ambassadors daughter marina montoya de perez was abducted 
in bogota several hours before the nighttime kidnapping in the 
capital of francisco santos his family owns el tiempo colombias 
largest newspaper 
santos was taken by a group of heavily armed men traveling in 
two jeeps who shot his driver to death before forcing him into one 
of the jeeps the police said in a report 
also wednesday the newspaper el espectador citing official 
sources reported that drug traffickers had offered 280000 to 
those who helped a man accused of killing a presidential candidate 
escape from prison 
jaime rueda rocha fled bogotas la picota penitentiary wearing a 
disguise and apparantly aided by a man posingas his lawyer a 
police report said 
rueda was one of three suspects being held for the murder of 
sen luis carlos galan the popular presidential candidate shot ato 
death on aug 18 1989 his death set off the governments war with 
medellin cartel leaders who authorities say masterminded galans 
killing 
officials say rueda helped coordinate the cartels bombing 
campaigns during the past year and is one of the countrys most 
dangerous terrorists 
earlier this month president cesar gaviria decreed that drug 
traffickers who turn themselves in and confess their crimes can be 
tried in colombia and not be extradited to the united states the 
fate they fear most 
there has been no official response from the cartel to gavirias 
offer which provides reduced sentences of up to 50 percent to 
surrendering drug traffickers 
drug traffickers issued a communique on tuesday saying they will 
maintain the ceasefire in their attacks against the goverment 
which have claimed the lives of about 550 people this year 
they declared the unilateral ceasefire on july 27 
for the moment it is not in our interest to reactivate the 
bomb attacks in any area of the country said a statement bearing 
the letterhead the extraditables as the medellin cartel calls 
itself

the liveliest middle east battlefield is the 
oped page where abe accuses pat of antisemitism pat says abe 
executed a contract hit on him for the israel lobby and the 
normally combative bill tries to mediate 
the stateside war of the columnists involves am rosenthal 
patrick buchanan and william f buckley jr in a debate over us 
middle east policy that seems to have almost forgotten about iraq 
fighting began in the last week of august on the mclaughlin 
group the television talk show on which buchanan is a regular 
asked if he thought war with iraq was inevitable buchanan said 
no and added there are only two groups that are beating the 
drums right now for war in the middle east and that is the israeli 
defense ministry and its amen corner in the united states 
those are fighting words host john mclaughlin noted 
rosenthal former executive editor and now columnist for the new 
york times thought so too he wrote in fridays column 
we are not dealing here with countryclub antisemitism but 
with the blood libel that often grows out of it jews are not like 
us but are others with alien loyalties for which they will 
sacrifice the lives of americans 
rosenthal denounced buchanans venom about jews in one 
column he denounced five people for supporting military action 
against iraq all jews including me 
the buchananrosenthal feud is part of a broader rift among 
conservative columnists over whether the us is overextending 
itself militarily in the postcold war world particularly in the 
persian gulf 
its been a long time since columnists have mattered so 
much peggy noonan a former speech writer for ronald reagan and 
george bush said last week its exciting 
in a column published wednesday in the new york post and 
elsewhere buchanan denied rosenthals charge 
what we have here friends is a contract hit done my guess 
in collusion with the same folks who used to feed me all that good 
stuff on jesse jackson when i was considered more reliable for the 
one character who has been howling about the amen corner remark 
is abe foxman of the antidefamation league 
why else argued the former aide to presidents nixon and reagan 
would rosenthal have waited three weeks to write about a remark he 
found so upsetting 
once buchanan wrote i was an uncritical apologist for 
israel but became disillusioned for a variety of reasons 
including israels treatment of palestinians its attempts to spy 
on the united states and the caustic cutting cracks about my 
roman catholic church and popes from both israel and its amen 
corner in the united states 
on wednesdays editorial page the post sided with rosenthal 
besides the column in which buchanan listed americans with jewish 
names who favored an attack on iraq there was one in which he 
wrote that in case of war americans would march up that bloody 
road to baghdad kids with names like mcallister murphy 
gonzales and leroy brown 
the names in this list are chosen just as carefully we 
believe as the names on his list of alleged warmongers the 
rosenthals and the krauthammers and so forth the post 
editorialized 
meanwhile in wednesdays daily news buckley tried to bring 
some perspective to the fight which he called the hot talk among 
journalists and politicsminded intellectuals 
peacemaker was an unlikely role for a man who has long baited 
guests on his aptlynamed television program firing line and 
who once came close to slugging gore vidal on live national 
television after vidal called him a crypto nazi 
buckley described both columnists as his friends the 
occasionally volatile rosenthal had gone ballistic he said 
and buchanan had been insensitive to those fine lines that tend 
publicly to define racially or ethnically offensive analysis or 
rhetoric 
the buchanans need to understand the nature of sensibilities 
in an age that coexisted with auschwitz he wrote and the 
rosenthals need to understand that clumsy forensic manners are less 
than a genocidal offense 
rosenthal returned a telephone call wednesday thus getting the 
last word or at least the latest one buchanan did not call after 
a message was left for him 
rosenthal said he had not written earlier about the amen 
corner remark because he had been away at a conference in norway 
on hatred appropriately enough and on vacation 
pat buchanan is no longer my problem he said he is now 
the problem of people who print him and put him on the air most of 
all hes pat buchanans problem

sickness starvation and the 
possibility of further fighting are on the rise in liberia but 
rival guerrilla chiefs are willing to talk peace a senior us 
diplomat said after meeting the leaders 
herman cohen us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs had put himself at considerable personal risk in traveling 
to the civil warravaged land where sporadic fighting continues 
the prospects for increased warfare are growing cohen told 
a news conference wednesday in abidjan after returning from the 
visit 
i feel the situation in liberia is deteriorating more and 
more people are in danger of starvation and death from diseases 
especially a growing cholera threat cohen said 
he said conditions worsened after president samuel doe accused 
by the rebels of corruption and human rights abuses was captured 
and killed last week by the rebel forces of prince johnson 
reprisals against doe supporters have been reported and many doe 
loyalists are still refusing to surrender to rebels for fear of 
being killed rival rebel forces have also clashed 
cohen spoke hours after the commander of a west african 
multinational army sent to end the fighting in liberia announced 
his 3000 troops have a new mandate to launch a total offensive 
to end the 9monthold war 
nigeria and ghana on wednesday were preparing to send another 
1000 soldiers to monrovia they were waiting in freetown to board 
ships for the besieged capital 
more than 5000 people mostly civilians have died in the 
conflict they were killed mainly because of their tribal 
affiliation 
earlier wednesday cohen crossed the border from ivory coast to 
go behind the lines of rebel leader charles taylor who controls 
most of liberia 
the us envoy said he found the man many accuse of prolonging 
the war in a negotiating mood 
on tuesday he flew to monrovia aboard a us marine helicopter 
and met with rival rebel chief johnson whose forces control 
liberias capital he was helpful and prodemocratic cohen 
said 
johnson a former taylor lieutenant has embraced west african 
economic community plans to use their task force to force a 
ceasefire and install an interim government to organize fair 
elections 
he has said he wants to return to the barracks where he started 
off as an officer of doe 
taylor says his men will fight until the west africans withdraw 
he has said he wants democracy but that he also would be unhappy to 
see anyone but himself lead liberia for up to five years after the 
conflict ends 
cohen said both rebel leaders said they would like to see 
liberia with a truly democratic system and would cooperate in 
organizing that 
i have the feeling that charles taylor is prepared to 
negotiate everything i think he feels that peace is more important 
than war cohen said 
in response to questions he did not rule out aid for the west 
african army from nigeria ghana guinea sierra leone and gambia 
everything is going to be reviewed he said having reported 
back to president bush 
the united states has been under considerable pressure to send 
troops to stop the bloodshed which began when taylors fighters 
invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 to topple doe 
before cutting aid in 1985 the united states gave does 
administration half a billion dollar in aid despite repeated 
charges of human rights violations doe took power in a bloody 1980 
coup

pierre rinfret the republicans 
lastminute bottomofthebarrel choice to run against democratic 
gov mario cuomo is out of money out a campaign manager and 
practically out of the race 
john denny rinfrets deputy campaign manager said wednesday 
there was a strong possibility rinfret will stop actively 
campaigning because of money woes 
the millionaire economist who in recent months had been derided 
by prominent members of his own party as a buffoon and 
brainless wonder accused state gop leaders of failing to back 
him financially 
our financial situation is so desperate that im probably 
going to have to shut down our entire operation this friday 
rinfret wrote to gop leaders tuesday i thought you should know 
that all of our money is gone 
the 66yearold candidate would not elaborate on the statement 
also on wednesday state assemblyman john faso rinfrets 
campaign manager said in a statement he was no longer part of 
the campaignit has been mutually decided that the campaign 
would take a different direction he said 
william simon rinfrets campaign finance chairman also 
defected i told him im not a fundraiser thats it simon 
said i wish him well 
rinfrets darkhorse challenge to cuomos bid for a third 
fouryear term marks the first run for public office for the former 
unpaid adviser to president nixon 
desperate gop officials recruited rinfret in may after a host of 
prominent republicans refused to take on cuomo including housing 
and urban development secretary jack kemp and sen alfonse damato 
damato at one point called a race against cuomo a kamikaze 
mission 
a statewide poll released this week had cuomo as the choice of 
60 percent of 821 voters surveyed rinfret had less than 15 
percent the survey by the marist college institute for public 
opinion has a margin of error of four points 
during the campaign rinfret has called for the possible sale of 
the new york city subway system and invited a tv reporter to his 
inauguration with the suggestion she leave her husband at home 
his academic credentials were questioned after he distributed a 
biography that gave him the title dr which he claimed to be 
entitled to because of a diploma from a french university 
cuomo has reported having about 8 million in his campaign fund 
rinfret has reported raising about 900000 including a 500000 
loan from himself 
denny refused to say how much was left in the rinfret campaign 
kitty except that it was not much 
john mcardle a spokesman for state senate majority leader ralph 
marino would not say how much if any money rinfret would be 
given by republican leaders but he added we cant let him fold 
up shop 
its in all of our interests to help our gubernatorial 
candidate and we intend to help him to the extent we can mcardle 
said 
this close to the nov 6 election rinfrets name can be removed 
from the ballot only if he dies or moves out of state 
some gop leaders said rinfret should have kept quiet for the 
sake of the party 
it certainly puts his campaign in reverse gear said john 
cochrane a state assemblyman and suffolk county gop chairman it 
makes all our campaigns more difficult when the standardbearer is 
obviously going through a difficult time and goes public with it

public spending on drug abuse treatment should 
be increased by more than 2 billion to help more users quit their 
drug habits a panel of experts recommends 
treatment needs to be recognized as a more important component 
of drug policy than it has been in recent years lawrence s 
lewin chairman of the institute of medicine committee that studied 
the problem said wednesday 
it is time we allocated sufficient resources so that everyone 
who needs drug treatment will be able to get it he said 
an estimated 55 million people in the united states need 
treatment for drug abuse or dependence according to the panels 
report which was requested by congress 
but in 1987 the latest year for which figures were available 
only about 650000 received treatment in public programs and 
200000 were treated in private programs the report said

millions of infant deaths could be prevented 
if women in developing nations increased the length of time between 
births an independent agency has reported 
birth intervals of less than two years are strongly and 
consistently associated with higher mortality the population 
crisis committee said in a report wednesday 
when there is less than two years between births the risk of 
the second child dying in infancy is increased by between 60 
percent and 70 percent the study said and it doubles the chance 
of the earlier child dying by age 5 
family planning should be the first step toward improving 
child survival said sharon l camp vice president of the 
committee which advocates provision of contraceptives and family 
planning programs 
through family planning the cycle of weak mothers giving birth 
to weak children can be broken camp said 
while admitting that accurate statistics are difficult to 
collect in many developing nations the report estimates that 10 
million infants and 4 million children age 1 to 5 die each year 
about 18 million of these deaths could be prevented by 
extending the interval between births to two years the study 
estimates 
the study also said infant and child deaths could be reduced by 
as many as 3 million annually through the use of family planning 
services to delay first births for young women and to space them 
out later

americans are being warned about a possible 
imminent terrorist bombing in manila where talks on the future 
of us military bases in the philippines are underway 
the us government believes this threat to be both specific 
and credible the state department said in a statement late 
wednesday linking the possible bombing to the communist new 
peoples army 
the department said the danger was in the vicinity of roxas 
boulevard in manila 
several hotels the us embassy and the central bank building 
where the base talks are being held lie along the boulevard which 
runs from near the manila airport to the heart of the city 
also on the street is a us government residential and 
recreational compound seafront that was the site of a bombing 
last year that was blamed on communist rebels no one was injured 
the new peoples army has been trying to overthrow the 
philippine government for more than two decades 
there have been several bombings within the last few weeks but 
the government of president corazon aquino has blamed most of them 
on rightwing rebel soldiers 
the base talks which opened tuesday aim to produce a new 
agreement for the future of the us military in the philippines 
the presence of 40000 us armed forces personnel and 
dependents most at clark air base and subic naval base has been 
the target of largescale protests richard armitage the chief 
us negotiator at the talks said the american presence will be 
reduced 
the state department has issued several warnings to us 
citizens in the past about general threats against americans in the 
philippines but the one issued wednesday night was unusually

former republican gov walter j hickel 
has jumped into alaskas gubernatorial race at the last minute as a 
thirdparty candidate 
the 71yearold developer launched his surprise comeback bid 
wednesday under the banner of the alaskan independence party whose 
ticket led by john lindauer withdrew to let hickel in 
sen jack coghill who was the lieutenant governor candidate on 
the republican ticket with nominee arliss sturgulewski switched to 
the thirdparty ticket with hickel 
some politicians said hickels entry into the race would work to 
the benefit of the democratic candidate former anchorage mayor 
tony knowles by splitting the gop vote and throwing sturgulewskis 
campaign into disarray 
hickel was known as a champion of development while governor 
from 1966 to 1969 when he was appointed interior secretary by 
president nixon he was dismissed in 1970 for his inability to get 
along with the white house 
the spirit of alaska has been lost in recent years hickel 
said in announcing his comeback bid 
hickel who wants to build a natural gas pipeline liquefaction 
plant and port to export gas to asia said he offers a cando 
attitude many alaskans had found lacking in the election campaign 
im not one to study things to death he said i get 
things done 
papers nominating hickel and coghill were filed with the state a 
halfhour before the 5 pm deadline 
hickel enters the race six weeks before election day without a 
campaign headquarters and without having raised any money but he 
said the best campaign office i know is right out there on the 
streets and in the villages 
hickel is owner of a company that builds and operates hotels and 
shopping centers in alaska 
sturgulewski forced to scramble to find a new running mate 
chose anchorage businessman jim campbell who came in a strong 
second to her in the aug 28 gop primary 
its an unfortunate thing for alaska politics she said of 
coghills defection im fortunate to be a running mate with 
someone who doesnt play those kinds of games 
coghill said he made the switch because conservatives were not 
being won over by the sturgulewski campaign 
democratic gov steve cowper who is not seeking a second term 
said he believes the development will help knowles alaska 
politics has always been a wild west show and it looks like this 
is the shootout at the gop corral he said 
the alaskan independence party was the vehicle used in previous 
gubernatorial campaigns by fringe candidate joe vogler a miner who 
argued that alaska is unfairly and illegally treated as a colony by 
the federal government

a proposal to curtail the gulf coast 
shrimping season to protect red snapper that get caught up and die 
in shrimp nets would imperil a 12 billion industry shrimpers 
say 
id like to see you close your business down for three months 
and make a living texas shrimp association president harry 
lassaigne argued wednesday at a hearing of the gulf of mexico 
fishery management council 
the council made up of federal and state fishery officials from 
five gulf coast states was expected to vote today on a proposal to 
ban trawling in may june and july beginning next year 
on tuesday a subpanel of the council voted down the proposal 
but the vote was nonbinding 
government marine researchers say red snapper stocks are 
dwindling rapidly with 10 million to 12 million of the fish dying 
in shrimp nets each year 
the shrimp association disputes those figures because sampling 
of bycatch unwanted species caught in shrimp nets stopped in 
1982 and argues that curtailing trawling would endanger an 
industry that employs 137000 people along the gulf coast 
fishermen argued however that the gulfs snapper industry is 
in greater need of protecting 
the gulf of mexico isnt a limitless source of fish florida 
fisherman bob zales said the bycatch is a definite problem if 
youre not going to do anything about the bycatch of shrimpers 
its not fair to impose quotas on others 
zales and other charter boat operators said they already face 
limits on the number of red snapper they can catch in florida 
waters and elsewhere 
you cant expect me to suffer more economic difficulty while 
someones nets drag the bottom and kill baby fish zales said 
about 500 people attended wednesdays hearing including 75 
shrimpers of valley interfaith a political action group from port 
isabel texas at least 90 percent of that towns 8000 residents 
are employed in the shrimping industry

the sweet smell of success is wafting from the 
citys trash with more than 100000 new yorkers applying for jobs 
as sanitation workers 
its a record turnout of applicants for any city job officials 
said wednesday and at least one of them thinks he knows why 
for somebody who likes the outdoors its a good clean 
living said sanitation department spokesman vito turso you 
can build up your muscles and then get them tanned 
sure but what makes people look at garbage and see gold 
try 23104 per year to start with the salary climbing to 
35000 after five years add in overtime and a likely raise with 
the next city contract and its obvious all that smells doesnt 
necessarily stink 
the job requirements are minimal a drivers license and a 
strong back the work week is 35 hours with the shift running from 
7 am to 3 pm summer hours let workers out at 2 pm as with 
most city jobs there are comprehensive benefits 
negatives the average city sanitation worker lifts five tons of 
garbage per day the rough equivalent of two toyotas and the odds 
of bagging a position are 50to1 
as of wednesday 102000 people had registered to take the 
written test this saturday of those who pass 15000 will be 
selected randomly by computer and given the physical test 
eventually 2000 will be hired over the next four years city 
budgets permitting 
virtually all are expected to pass the written test which is 
basically trashspecific 
its mostly reading comprehension they receive manuals on 
operating the trucks and safety and the questions deal with 
that turso explained for example which button do you push to 
start the truck button a like that 
when the test was last given in 1983 nearly 95 percent of the 
88000 applicants passed the written part 
the physical test is a bit heavier potential trashcarriers 
last time had 27 minutes to load 147 sacks of simulated garbage 
2975 pounds worth into a hopper set at the height of a garbage 
truck 
each applicant has paid a 15 fee to take the written test 
despite the long odds other than that they might have little in 
common the applicants cross all lines of sex and age with 
potential employees coming from all walks of life turso said 
weve had individuals come out in their 50s gray haired 
grandchildren in tow said turso and some of them have 
actually been called up

the russian republics parliament today 
overwhelmingly approved a resolution urging soviet prime minister 
nikolai i ryzhkov and his cabinet to resign calling them unable 
to save the country from economic ruin 
the measure passed on a 1641 vote with 16 abstentions said 
ryzhkovs government is not capable of pulling the country out of 
its deep economic crisis 
the russian body called on the national parliament or supreme 
soviet to solve the question of the resignation of the entire 
government of the ussr 
the resolution was referring to the council of ministers and not 
president mikhail s gorbachev who has backed a sweeping 500day 
program that would bring quicker marketoriented reform than 
ryzhkov has called for 
the russian parliament last week threw its support behind the 
500day plan 
the national supreme soviet is now considering whether to 
approve it or one of two other major proposals ryzhkov presented 
his proposal the most conservative to the national body last 
week 
russia is by far the largest of the countrys 15 republics 
home to half the soviet people and its lawmakers have 
considerable influence in the national supreme soviet which is to 
meet monday 
under soviet law the national parliament could call an 
extraordinary meeting of its parent body the congress of peoples 
deputies which by a twothirds vote has the right to force the 
prime minister and his cabinet out of office 
ryzhkov has been under fire for months amid increasing shortages 
of basic goods the communist system has been unable to produce in 
sufficient quantity 
the people are living worse each year said ilya 
konstantinov a russian parliament lawmaker from leningrad 
its obvious that the ryzhkov government could not and cannot 
correct the problem its also obvious that the ryzhkov government 
is opposed to adopting the radical program of economic reforms 
he said 
the russian action today came four days after thousands of 
demonstrators marched in moscow and demanded ryzhkovs resignation 
citing the failing economy many also called for gorbachev to 
resign 
ryzhkov has acknowledged publicly that his government will not 
be able to implement the more radical 500day plan and he 
indicated he would resign if the national parliament were to vote 
for it 
ryzhkovs plan envisions continued central control of the 
economy while gradual moves are made toward a marketbased system 
the 500day plan backed by the russian parliament would return 
land to private farmers sell government enterprises to private 
stockholders and gradually remove statecontrolled prices on many 
goods 
it would transfer most economic authority from the central 
government to the 15 soviet republics most of which are pushing 
for greater sovereignty or independence 
gorbachev has backed a compromise plan that contains many 
elements of the 500day blueprint but would move more slowly and 
leave the central goverment with strong powers including the 
ability to levy taxes in the republics 
ryzhkov 60 became prime minister in 1985 and he has often 
been seen in public next to the soviet leader

fraternities at the university of 
pennsylvania their image tarnished by a series of crimes and 
pranks have adopted a bring your own booze policy for parties 
we are attempting to take control of a dangerous situation 
before it takes control of us said bret kinsella a member of 
kappa sigma and president of the intrafraternity council 
the policy announced tuesday calls for professional doormen at 
all parties to check that guests are of legal drinking age guests 
cannot bring in more than 12 bottles of beer or an equivalent 
amount of alcohol 
the frat will store the booze and distribute drinks using a 
ticket system 
in recent years pranks an alleged gang rape and a kidnapping 
have hurt the image of the ivy league schools 31 fraternities 
one reason for the new policy kinsella said was increasing 
liability insurance ranging from 65 to 350 a year per member 
we think it is a very responsible action in light of the 
issues of risk and liability they face said kim morrisson vice 
provost for university life but she said there will have to be 
some further discussion of amounts 
bill epstein assistant to university president sheldon hackney 
said 12 beers sounded a little on the fluid side

told him a lot of personal things you know how girls talk to one 
another said one teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he asked a lot of personal stuff 
he also attracted the admiration of the football team said a 
student who asked that her name not be used 
police said daugherty presented school officials with a 
computerized list of courses he had completed and grades to match 
all as and bs school officials initially were skeptical but 
allowed him to enroll until more detailed records could be 
obtained 
meanwhile things started to unravel for him driscoll said 
daugherty is described as 5foot9 and 164 pounds a build that 
made teachers and students look twice 
school officials increasingly became suspicious and decided to 
check telephone numbers and addresses daugherty had provided 
police were called to the school when administrators concluded the 
information was false 
this guys good driscoll said the school i think was 
pretty astute in catching him as fast as they did

the five permanent members of the security 
council have drafted a resolution that would impose a stiff air 
embargo on iraq prohibiting planes from delivering all but 
humanitarian cargo 
the full 15member council is expected to vote on the measure 
friday or saturday diplomats said it is virtually assured passage 
because only the five permament members britain france the 
united states soviet union and china have veto power on the 
council 
the resolution says no state shall permit any aircraft of any 
nation to fly over its territory to or from iraq or kuwait unless 
the aircraft lands for inspection and possible detention 
it does not call for the use of force 
the draft resolution also calls for detention of 
iraqiregistered ships in foreign ports if they are violating the 
existing unordered embargo on trade 
the resolution says all states despite their international 
obligations shall not permit their airlines to operate any 
scheduled or nonscheduled flights to or from iraq or kuwait if 
they carry cargo other than medical or humanitarian food supplies 
it also prohibits any aircraft registered in iraq or under 
charter to a national of iraq to land in foreign territory with 
unauthorized cargo which is not part of a mercy flight 
diplomats said the language of the resolution was being refined 
and it still must be considered by the nonaligned and other states 
before a formal council session 
the resolution also warns of further unspecified steps saying 
the council is putting the government of iraq on notice that its 
continued failure to comply with security council resolutions 
will lead the council to take further action under the un charter 
with potentially severe consequences 
it confirms that the existing trade embargo approved by the 
council applies to all means of transport including aircraft 
un officials meanwhile said secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar was willing to talk to iraqi president saddam hussein in 
baghdad about a peaceful solution to the crisis but only if the 
session could be productive 
plo leader yassser arafat has said earlier that saddam was 
prepared to negotiate a political solution to the crisis with perez 
de cuellar 
francois giuliani the secretarygenerals spokesman said perez 
de cuellar had not been approached by arafat 
if he had an invitation to go to baghdad and felt it would be 
useful without raising false expectations and with some indication 
of flexibility then of course he is prepared to go 
the secretarygeneral on tuesday expressed frustration about his 
recent talks in amman jordan with iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz he said he had seen no movement toward dialogue to defuse the 
crisis

horizon as they began the high holidays 
thankfulness was expressed at the crumbling of communism in 
eastern europe and swelling emigration to freedom of soviet jews

citing earlier hopeful signs in the world the loosening of the 
deadly clutch of the superpowers and receding of the threat 
of a nuclear holocaust rabbi alexander m schindler said 
the guns of august changed all that their thunder reminded us 
that aggression still menaces humankind and that free nations must 
be ready to resist it 
schindler president of reform judaisms union of american 
hebrew congregations said israel is at special risk 
just as antisemitism was the cement that bound the nazi 
cnspiracy so does iraqs saddam hussein seek to unite the arab 
world with his antiisrael war cries he said 
however he said there is one shaft of light in an otherwise 
gloomy sky that the threat of iraq will impel other arab states 
to join egypt in reaching an understanding with israel

expressed gratification at the end of the cold war and moves toward 
greater democracy

including antisemitism and dangerous forms of nationalism in 
eastern europe 
he urged prayers that the international intervention by east and 
west and by arab and nonarab nations against saddam would 
succeed and succeed peacefully 
we cannot allow him to hold the world hostage comay said 
in a similar vein kent e schiner president of bnai brith

pregnant women who enjoy relaxing in the hot tub 
shouldnt stay in more than 10 minutes says a study published 
today 
too much tub time can raise a womans body temperature enough to 
cause malformations in the fetus said the study appearing as a 
letter in the new england journal of medicine 
according to the latest research pregnant women should not 
spend any more than 10 minutes in a tub when the water is 104 
degrees 
to reach this conclusion the researchers conducted an 
experiment on 24 young nonpregnant women to see how long it takes 
for their innerbody temperature to reach 102 the point that can 
be hazardous to the fetus 
they found that some people heat up twice as fast as others in 
a 104degree tub some womens bodies reached 102 in as little as 
12 minutes while others took 23 minutes 
they also found that half of the women did not feel 
uncomfortably hot when their temperatures hit 102 
we conclude that at least in nonpregnant women subjective 
discomfort is not wholly reliable as a safeguard against 
overheating and that time limits should also be used the 
researchers wrote 
the study was conducted in australia by barry r ridge of the 
university of western sydneymacarthur and dr grahame m budd of 
the national institute of occupational health and safety in sydney

to set bail at 5 million for charles h keating jr on savings and 
loan fraud charges agreed to a hearing today on lowering the 
amount 
for district attorney ira reiner and his staff the high bail 
set tuesday by superior court judge gary klausner came as something 
of a shock 
in negotiating keatings surrender prosecutors told the defense 
the bail decision would be left to the judge but they indicated 
the amount would probably be far lower 
when the judge set it at 5 million we were probably as 
surprised as mr keating said mike botula a reiner spokesman 
keating and three codefendants whose bail was set at 1 
million each remained in jail in the first criminal case stemming 
from the 2 billion collapse of lincoln savings and loan the 
nations biggest sampl failure 
they face up to 10 years in prison if convicted

headed lincolns parent american continental corp in phoenix 
the defendants were accused of swindling junkbond investors by 
misrepresenting the safety of the investments all told more than 
20000 investors are believed to have lost 250 million on the now 
virtually worthless securities 
the judge in setting bail said he considered the charges 
serious 
afterward posecutors agreed to waive the normal fiveday wait 
before a bail reduction hearing 
keating became a prominent symbol of the nations sampl scandal 
because of his lavish personal habits his risky investments his 
political access and the high cost of bailing out lincoln

the dollar closed at 13705 yen down 1 yen from wednesdays 
13805yen finish it opened at 13720 yen and ranged between 
13645 yen and 13740 yen 
after opening lower the us currency fluctuated nervously 
influenced by a rumor that iraqs saddam hussein had begun efforts 
to settle the crisis dealers said 
the rumor initially believed by japanese investors 
temporarily boosted the yen around noon to 13645 yen per dollar 
said eiichi seino a dealer with fuji bank but the dollar 
narrowed its losses after the rumor later turned out to be 
groundless and discouraged participants started to pick up the 
us currency again 
naohiko yasuda a bank of tokyo dealer attributed the dollars 
weakness to the yens strength in cross trading against european 
currencies 
the dollar strengthened earlier this week when investors began

level since feb 3 1988 when it ended trading at 2359537 
trading was thin with volume on the markets first section 
estimated at 360 million shares down from 400 million on 
wednesday 
the index which started higher helped by bargain hunting 
erased its early gains when pessimism and uncertainties about the 
market discouraged investors traders said 
although the nikkei narrowed its losses early in the afternoon 
due to the higher yen it failed to bounce back because of the 
markets pessimism said sadayoshi kiuchi an analyst with nomura 
securities co 
we think the market is about to hit bottom but investors were 
still reluctant to increase their holdings in an attempt to avoid 
risks ahead of account settlements for the first half of fiscal 
1990 he said the first half of the fiscal year ends sept 30 
for most japanese companies 
in bond dealings the yield of benchmark no 119 10year

american and other evacuees from kuwait 
who arrived in britain on an iraqi jet say food and medical 
supplies are running short in kuwait garbage is piled in the 
streets and rats are a growing problem 
a total of 416 evacuees many of them women and children 
arrived on an iraqi airways boeing 747 at gatwick airport outside 
london shortly before midnight 
a state department spokesman in washington said they included 
110 americans accompanied by about 200 of their foreignborn 
family members 
also on the plane which was chartered by the us government 
and had flown from kuwait to baghdad earlier wednesday were 37 
britons and five canadians 
the remaining evacuees on the plane were jordanians egyptians 
palestinians icelanders spaniards greeks kenyans and 
indonesians 
the spokesman said the americans and their family members who 
spent the night in hotels in and around gatwick would fly today to 
raleighdurham nc on another plane chartered by the us 
government 
the british news agency press association said iraqis heading 
home from britain were due to join the iraqi airways plane at 
gatwick for its return flight to baghdad 
britain on monday ordered the expulsion of two military attaches 
and six support staff from the iraqi embassy in london and 23 other 
iraqis in britain in retaliation for iraqi intrusions into some 
western embassies in kuwait 
among those escaping kuwait was a man who would only give his 
name as hassan who said he was from salt lake city and had lived 
in kuwait for the last three years 
he said conditions are terrible there food and medicine are 
scarce there is almost nothing we have got water but that is 
about all 
kuwait city is dirty sickness will probably spread very 
quickly if nobody cleans the town right now they are burning the 
garbage but the rats are getting really bad 
he added kuwait this morning wednesday was calm but we have 
heard firing especially at night 
heidi hadi from layton utah who said she had lived in kuwait 
for five years arrived at gatwick with her 11monthold son 
abdullah she said her kuwaiti husband who worked for the kuwaiti 
interior ministry was still there 
they the iraqis have burned and stolen everything she 
said they have raped young kuwaiti girls as young as 14 15 and 
16 
she said kuwaiti resistance fighters included both men and women 
but she said the numbers involved in the fighting against iraqi 
troops following the aug 2 invasion were small 
she said some iraqi soldiers felt guilty about being in kuwait 
there are iraqis not happy to be there these soldiers they 
cry they grab children and say you look like my daughter i want 
to go home i dont want to be here

a woman who agreed to bear a child for a 
couple using their egg and sperm gave birth 2 weeks ahead of 
schedule escalating a custody battle that could break new ground 
over surrogacy 
anna johnson and the 6pound 10ounce boy were reported in good 
condition after an uncomplicated delivery wednesday 
mark and crispina calvert the couple who hired johnson to carry 
the baby for 10000 visited the infant wednesday night 
it looks like us mrs calvert said 
its got my nose and real straight brownish hair calvert 
said 
months ago johnson backed out of the deal and sued the couple 
for custody 
the outcome of the case could be a groundbreaking ruling over 
what constitutes parenthood the childs genetic makeup or the act 
of bearing a child or a narrow custody decision focused on the 
childs best interests 
arguments in the case originally set for sept 27 were 
rescheduled for friday 
johnson 29 who knew mrs calvert 36 from a santa ana 
hospital where they both worked as nurses claims the couples 
enthusiasm for the pregnancy waned 
the calverts did not visit johnson at st josephs hospital 
after the birth but left her a bouquet of red roses 
its extremely uplifting said richard c gilbert johnsons 
lawyer even in the middle of this mess its still so exciting 
anna is in heaven 
william steiner the childs legal guardian ordered hospital 
officials not to release the baby until a judge decides who will 
have temporary custody said harold f laflamme the infants 
courtappointed lawyer 
under steiners orders the hospital will treat the baby as if 
he has three parents laflamme said 
johnson was implanted with an embryo conceived from crispinas 
egg and marks sperm 
attorneys for the calverts say she is the first surrogate mother 
to sue for custody rights even though she has no genetic link to 
the child she delivered 
the case differs from the baby m case in new jersey because that 
child was conceived by a surrogate mother mary beth whitehead 
with the sperm of a man william stern whose wife couldnt have a 
baby 
whitehead sued for custody of the child and lost 
gilbert said wednesday his client will agree to a shared 
parenting arrangement under which the baby could spend time with 
johnson and the calverts 
laflamme said he has obtained a court order for immediate dna 
testing of the baby to confirm its parentage johnsons attorneys 
have raised the possibility that the embryo implant did not take 
and the baby is hers genetically 
johnson calls the child matthew nurses at the orange hospital 
call him baby boy johnson mrs calvert said she and her husband 
want to name the child michael christian 
im real excited but im also worried mrs calvert said 
i know in my heart that hes our bab but theres still the 
question what if we dont win what if we dont get him

saudi arabia has given lebanon 100 
million to help it cope with the civil warravaged economy that was 
aggravated by iraqs invasion of kuwait a government statement 
said today 
saudi arabia informed prime minister salim hoss on wednesday 
night that saudi king fahd personally ordered the cash transfer to 
the lebanese central bank the statement said 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the gift was a tranquilizer which will help avoid a further 
deterioration of the economic situation but not resolve the 
problem 
it will definitely help rebuild some sort of confidence for 
the future said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the iraqi invasion sabotaged plans for a 2 billion arab fund to 
shore up a lebanese economy wracked by 15 years of sectarian 
fighting that has claimed 130000 lives contributors were to be 
the oilrich countries of the persian gulf including kuwait 
but after iraqs aug 2 seizure of kuwait focus shifted away 
from lebanon as saudi arabia and its gulf arab neighbors began 
channeling money to help kuwaiti refugees and finance multinational 
forces massing up against iraq 
the lebanese pound plunged to a record low of 1200 pounds to 
the dollar in recent days it sold for 600 to the dollar before the 
gulf crisis 
the prices of commodities have tripled or quadrupled over the 
last two weeks 
the governmentdecreed minimum wage of 45000 lebanese pounds a 
month is now worth 40 compared to more than 80 in late july 
lebanons deficit of the 1990 fiscal year was estimated at 50 
million 
the dollar marked a slow decline against the pound today 
opening at 1100 pounds to the dollar in the money market 
the lebanese pound was one of the soundest middle eastern 
currencies before the outbreak of its civil war between moslems and 
christians in 1975 it traded at 25 pounds to the dollar 
president elias hrawi last week appealed to fahd to spearhead an 
arab campaign aimed at providing lebanon with urgent aid to ward 
off the dangers of starvation and poverty threatening the 
lebanese society 
the arab leagues troubleshooter lakhdar ibrahimi an 
algerian has been campaigning in the arab world and europe to add 
lebanon to the list of countries hardesthit by the gulf crisis 
which now includes egypt jordan and turkey

younis bazzi climbed a cliff in beirut 
overlooking the mediterranean last week and flung himself onto the 
rocks below he was lebanons first fatality in the gulf crisis 
bazzi 45 a shiite moslem cab driver left a note on the cliff 
along with the identity cards of his four children imad 13 
ilham 11 fatima 9 and yousef 6 
i cant cope any more i cant feed even you let alone send 
you to school the note said ive decided to end my agony 
good luck to all of you and please forgive me 
bazzis death was a dramatic example of how iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait has caused more economic and social hardship in 
a country already ravaged by 15 years of civil war 
president elias hrawis government was counting on 2 billion in 
reconstruction aid pledged by the oilrich arab nations of the 
persian gulf to help shore up the lebanese economy 
this hope has been buried in kuwaits sands said a 
commentator on beiruts voice of the people radio station no one 
can expect anyone in the arabian peninsula to show concern for 
lebanon theyre preoccupied with the iraqi threat on their 
doorstep 
today the government said saudi arabia gave it 100 million 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the gift was a tranquilizer which will help avoid a further 
deterioration of the economic situation but not resolve the 
problem 
the invasion of kuwait sent the lebanese currency tumbling to a 
record low from 600 pounds to the dollar in late july to 1100 
pounds to the dollar now 
the prices of commodities have tripled or quadrupled over the 
last two weeks a loaf of bread costs 10 cents five times what it 
cost early last month 
the worldwide surge in oil prices triggered by the crisis has 
been devastating lebanon imports all its oil and is now paying 
double what it was six weeks ago with foreign currency it can ill 
afford 
its the same story with such staples as rice sugar 
vegetables potatoes milk and canned food lebanon has to import 
more than 90 percent of its food 
the minimum wage of 45000 lebanese pounds a month is now worth 
40 compared to more than 80 in late july 
my salarys barely enough to support my wife and two kids for 
one day let alone a whole month lamented mahmoud safi 30 a 
minimumwage bus driver 
economists say that the gulf crisis has done as much damage to 
the economy once the most prosperous in the middle east as the 15 
years of civil war israeli invasions and factional feuding put 
together 
frantic pleas by hrawi and prime minister salim hoss to have 
lebanon listed as a hardhit victim of the gulf crisis so it can 
qualify for international compensation have fallen on deaf ears 
in a recent message to western heads of state hrawi said some 
50000 lebanese who had been working in kuwait and sending home 
about 200 million a month are now broke 
one of them h zahreddin a wealthy businessman flew to beirut 
on aug 1 to throw a wedding party for his daughter at a posh 
beachside hotel 
i went to bed a millionaire and woke up in debt zahreddin 
said the next day the hotel refused to accept my kuwaiti dinar 
check to settle the party bill 
another lebanese resident of kuwait mahmoud kurdi drove from 
kuwait to spend his summer vacation at home in the ancient city of 
baalbek in east lebanon he crossed the syrian border into lebanon 
on aug 1 and stopped at the market town of chtaura to cash a bank 
check of 50000 kuwaiti dinars roughly 200000 
when moneychangers there demanded what he considered an 
unreasonably high exchange commission kurdi decided to cash his 
check for a better rate in beirut the next day but the next day

the operator of the savannah river nuclear 
arms plant has uncovered up to 2000 problems in one of the three 
reactors that could delay the yearend deadline for restarting 
operations an official said 
westinghouse savannah river co which runs the plant for the 
government has discovered the faults since midaugust said energy 
department assistant secretary steve richardson 
its like taking your car in and the mechanic really starts 
working on it and finds more things wrong richardson said 
those things were not anticipated in the schedule there was no 
way you could 
the plant in south carolina across the savannah river from 
augusta has been shut down since august 1988 because of safety 
concerns westinghouse which assumed control of the plant from du 
pont in april 1989 did not specify the nature of the latest 
problems 
westinghouse and energy department officials will recommend to 
energy secretary james d watkins within three weeks whether to 
delay the restart richardson said 
its too early to tell whether we would recommend any schedule 
changes said westinghouse spokesman bruce cadotte said we are 
still going through the analysis with the department of energy 
in may watkins said the reactor would begin lowpower testing 
in december and start producing materials for nuclear weapons later 
that month or early in january the other two reactors would begin 
production by october 1991 he said 
the savannah river reactors are the sole producers of tritium a 
radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear 
weapons because it decays 55 percent annually tritiumloaded 
warheads must be periodically replenished

any violence that might erupt in a city with 
strained relations between police and its minorities would only be 
defensive says a county commissioner who had issued a call to 
arms 
commissioner john wiley price who warned violence would result 
if the city hires a good old boy police chief whos insensitive 
to minorities told a news conference wednesday evening he was 
clarifying but not apologizing for the remarks 
and so i say to you today that the call to arms is not an 
offensive move its not a move of aggression price said we 
will say we will defend our community historically we had to 
defend our community and we will continue to defend our community 
that does not mean that we are going to be aggressive in going 
after police officers in this community but we are saying to you 
that we must defend our community at all costs 
price had made the earlier remarks in an interview published 
wednesday in the dallas morning news 
if you try to bring in a good old boy in this system were 
going to be in the streets physically literally shooting folks 
were not going to tolerate it the dallas county commissioner 
said in wednesdays article 
he later softened his remarks and told the newspaper he would 
advocate violence against police only in the event of officers 
violence against civilians 
the dallas county district attorneys office said it was 
investigating the legal implications if any of prices statements 
on violence prosecutors said they had received more than 100 
telephone calls about the statements wednesday 
there is a fine line between what is constitutionally 
protected free speech and what is not said ted steinke an 
assistant district attorney we are attempting to determine 
whether commissioner prices words have actually crossed that 
line 
at the news conference price said his statements quoted by the 
newspaper were irresponsible and may have been inflammatory 
i dont want anyone to take what i say and take it to the 
streets he said at this particular time taking it to the 
streets is inappropriate behavior 
he said he was saddened by the firing this month of chief mack 
vines hired in 1988 to mend relations with minorities that were 
strained mostly over a record number of police shootings of blacks 
and hispanics 
vines was accused of lying to a special panel investigating the 
firing of officer patrick lemaire who fatally shot an unarmed 
mexican national last year black and hispanic leaders had demanded 
lemaire be fired 
there are a number of our friends who are dallas police 
officers price told reporters i was called by them and they 
had some concerns on my remarks i assured them that in no way do 
we plan any kind of assault on the dallas police department 
organized or otherwise at this moment 
police spokesman bill bateman said the department issued a 
chiefs update on wednesday warning officers to be on the alert 
and to be responsible if they made comments to the press 
i do not think we should do anything in this city that 
polarizes the city and creates a hostile environment mayor 
annette strauss said of prices statements 
city councilwoman harriet miers said she hoped churches and 
other community organizations would let this city know that they 
dont like to be threatened and they dont like blackmail and this 
kind of behavior is totally unacceptable

a group of parents is suing a school system 
over its new program requiring students to perform 60 hours of 
volunteer work 
i dont want my son being told what to do said thomas 
moralis one of the plaintiffs whose son david is in the bethlehem 
area school district i went to school in a free america and i 
want the same for my children 
moralis and his wife and two other parents filed suit wednesday 
in us district court against the school board which approved the 
program last spring 
the lawsuit seeks to end the program and asks that the 
defendants pay for legal costs 
students are required to work 60 hours which can be spread over 
four years they choose where they will work from a list approved 
last week by the school board 
school board members defended the program 
i think it is good for our kids said board member john 
spirk adding that the city solicitor told the board the program 
was legal 
the administration researched it and found it something our 
kids ought to be working on he said 
the parents lawyer robert j magee said the school board used 
a similar program in atlanta as a model but the high school 
dropout rate in atlanta has increased since the program started 
the lawsuit said the program was inconsistent with certain 
values and standards the parents hold and it questions the 
programs safety 
thomas and barbara moralis were joined in the suit by thomas and 
barbara steirer whose daughter lynn ann is a student 
the parents are members of a 21family organization called 
citizens against mandatory service inc which is sponsoring the 
suit 
moralis opposes the choice of organizations including a 
religious group and a hospital operating room and said the 
students may have to pay a fee to join one group or to buy a 
uniform 
some cant afford this he said 
moralis said he does not oppose community service 
the school administration said that they dont care if they 
perform community service ever again after they graduate moralis 
added its destroying whatever good will and helpful attitude 
there existed in the community

the united states today offered to 
reduce its troop strength in the philippines but expressed hope it 
could maintain a military presence which both countries would 
judge appropriate 
us negotiators made the offer during the third day of talks on 
the future of clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations whose lease expires in september 1991 
philippine negotiators said they wanted to take operational 
control of clark as soon as possible although the proposed 
timetable was unclear philippine spokesman rafael alunan said the 
government was waiting for a us counterproposal 
us spokesman stanley schrager told reporters that the american 
team led by chief negotiator richard armitage outlined its 
proposals for a military presence after 1991 
we would hope that the relationship would continue with 
appropriate us access to and use of the philippine facilities 
together with a us military presence which both countries would 
judge appropriate to meet our needs schrager said 
the discussions were to continue friday alunan said the talks 
were expected to be adjourned then to an undetermined date 
earlier today alunan said president corazon aquino would order 
the dismantling of the six us military bases unless 
usphilippine talks produce an agreement by january 
if there is no treaty or arrangement lets say by january 
then we will most likely create a committee that will oversee 
the dismantling of the base alunan said 
it is important for us to have a treaty or an arrangement 
he said in a radio interview if there is no understanding 
nothing will come of the bases such that by sept 16 1991 they 
will have to leave 
the united states maintains 40000 troops defense department 
civilians and military dependents at the six bases 
the bases are technically under philippine control but are 
effectively run by the americans who ruled this nation from 1898 
until independence in 1946 
mrs aquino said on the eve of the talks that the time had come 
for an orderly withdrawal of the bases the oldest and largest 
american overseas installations 
any treaty to keep the bases after the lease runs out requires 
approval by twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition is 
strong the philippine congress could also require the extension to 
be approved in a national referendum 
opponents such as communist rebels believe the bases infringe 
on national sovereignty 
in washington the state department warned americans in the 
philippines of a possible imminent terrorist bombing by the 
communist new peoples army against us government or other public 
facilities in manila 
a brief statement attributed to spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the danger was greatest in the vicinity of roxas 
boulevard where the us embassy is located and where talks on 
the future of the six us military bases in the philippines were 
being held 
american civilians said they were contacted by the embassy today 
and advised of the alleged threat 
in a related development the aquino government handed out a 
10page pamphlet today to the news media that sought to minimize 
the bases political and economic importance 
the government primer on the bases says the bases are not needed 
to prevent the overthrow of the government in december us jets 
from clark flew air cover for loyal troops during a coup attempt 
that claimed more than 100 lives later the government belittled 
the american role in saving mrs aquino 
the bases contribution to the economy in 1990 will amount to 
only 19 percent of the gross national product the pamphlet 
says 
the bases have created jobs for 130000 filipinos 
the facilities generate child prostitution aids and other 
sexually transmitted diseases abandoned amerasian children drug 
addition and dislocation of tribespeople from their ancestral 
lands according to the pamphlet 
but the pamphlet says that even if the bases are closed the 
philippines will still be committed to continue the friendship 
the country has had with the us for decades

iraq will knock out persian gulf oil fields 
if attacked by usled multinational forces in saudi arabia a 
senior iraqi official said in a statement published today 
iraqs strategic plan if it is attacked militarily is to 
destroy all oil fields in the region information minister latif 
nassayef jassim said 
he added iraq will use all weapons at its disposal to respond 
to any aggression that might be launched to force its occupation 
force to relinquish kuwait 
his remarks were published by the englishlanguage daily jordan 
times the newspaper said jassim made the threat to a group of 
jordanian journalists who visited iraq this week 
he said iraqs strategic aim is to free palestine echoing 
iraqi leader saddam husseins effort to negotiate simultaneous 
settlements for his occupation of kuwait and the palestinian 
problem to project himself as the unrivaled leader of the arab 
world 
western officials have expressed fears that iraq might be 
plotting a campaign of sabotage cia director william h webster 
said tuesday that iraqs terrorist capabilities chemical weapons 
and missiles pose a serious international threat 
what is difficult to determine he said is whether saddam would 
use these capabilities in the gulf standoff 
other iraqi officials also have said their military would deploy 
all weapons in case the forces in saudi arabia attacked iraq to 
reverse its aug 2 occupation of kuwait 
iraq is known to possess chemical weapons which it used in the 
198088 war against iran 
in 1988 saddam used chemical weapons against his own people 
while crushing a rebellion by the ethinic kurdish minority in 
northern iraq thousands of people were killed

noted sports columnist peter vecsey and 78 other 
new york post employees will leave the newspaper under a buyout 
plan that was part of a 19 million union concession package 
designed to keep the paper alive 
the newspaper guild resignations which were voluntary mean the 
post will lose close to 200 of its 960 workers 
agreements reached last week called for 100 forced resignations 
from the 263member drivers union and five from the posts 17 paper 
handlers 
all are to receive the same buyout package which includes full 
severance and an extra eight weeks pay they would have been 
entitled to if the paper had closed 
post editor jerry nachman said about half of the guild 
resignations were from the newsroom which translates to about a 
third of the news staff 
its not a number i like or im happy with he said 
the newspaper had sought only 43 resignations from the guild 
plus a 20 percent pay cut to keep the paper running 
but owner peter kalikow agreed in a lastminute compromise to 
accept however many voluntary resignations were tendered anyone 
choosing to resign by 5 pm wednesday would get the same 
termination and severance pay as if the paper had closed 
the guild resignations included people from editorial 
advertising circulation and accounting although a breakdown by 
department was not immediately available 
the total cost of the 79 resignations to the post was being 
tabulated post spokesman howard rubinstein said 
some highly talented individuals have elected to depart 
post spokesman howard rubinstein said 
but he added kalikow is extremely confident that they will 
continue to turn out an exciting newspaper that will have a major 
impact on the city 
thomas pennacchio guild secretarytreasurer said the newspaper 
most likely would have to hire more people to replace any 
overabundance of buyouts 
the sense is that some people want to leave because they cant 
afford the 20 percent cut pennachio said some are leaving 
because they think the post wont last long 
the guild had been the holdout among 11 unions that gave kalikow 
more than 19 million in concessions he demanded from them to 
eliminate his 27 million worth of annual red ink 
vecsey whose gossipy acerbic column was closely followed by 
fans of professional basketball will begin a sports column at usa 
today on oct 1 
post vice president peter faris said vecseys contract expires 
in november and the post did not match other offers he received 
he said vecseys resignation was divorced from the buyout 
scenario although as a guild member he is availing himself of the 
opportunity 
vecsey also recently signed to be a reporter on nbcs nba 
pregame show the insiders

the kgb would like to exchange information with 
the cia on iraq but has not made the offer directly because past 
proposals for cooperation have been rebuffed the spy agencys 
chief has told the associated press 
i am convinced that we could really tell each other something 
valuable especially about ensuring the security of soviet and 
american citizens in the persian gulf region kgb chairman 
vladimir a kryuchkov said in an interview 
if the cia wants help you can be sure that our reaction would 
be positive kryuchkov told the visiting ap board of directors 
and executives on wednesday 
he said his agency is also willing to work with us 
intelligence in fighting international terrorism and narcotics 
trafficking 
the balding whitehaired kryuchkov sat beneath a portrait of 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin beside the kgb chief was a vase 
of bright flowers that contrasted with the stark decor of the 
woodpaneled conference room on the third floor of the lubyanka 
the gray pink and yellow kgb headquarters in downtown moscow 
on his left hung a portrait of felix dzerzhinsky founder of the 
soviet secret police 
he joked with the group about the fear the kgb and the lubyanka 
inspired but said in serious tones that the agency was leaving 
behind that tragic page of history 
in meetings with american officials kryuchkov said we always 
give signals about being ready to work together in this or that 
field with us intelligence 
the signals reach the right address he said but the answer 
is always something along the lines of we are not ready yet 
it was not clear precisely what sort of information the soviets 
might be willing to offer the united states most iraqi military 
equipment is sovietmade and providing intelligence on how to 
defeat that equipment in battle might undermine the effectiveness 
of the soviet military in any possible confrontation with the 
united states 
moreover kryuchkov acknowledged the kremlin is concerned about 
possible iraqi actions against soviets who remain in that country 
the soviet union still has about 5000 specialists in iraq 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said in a separate 
briefing 
we used to have about 8000 experts including nonmilitary 
specialists he said 
we said that we evacuated children and women which is not 
exactly correct we evacuated spouses and children there are some 
women experts still there so far 2500 persons left iraq all the 
children all the spouses he said 
the soviet community is slightly more than 5000 about 60 of 
them are women these are experts of different soviet 
establishments there say typists said gerasimov 
the experts whose contracts expire leave the country using 
aeroflot regular flights he said referring to the soviet 
government airline iraqi authorities did not make any 
impediments to that 
kryuchkov in his interview with the ap also denied that the 
soviet government had planted electronic eavesdropping devices in 
the new us embassy office building in moscow 
us officials have accused the kgb of lacing the brick 
structure with sophisticated bugging devices the bush 
administration is weighing plans to destroy the structure and build 
another at a cost of tens of millions of dollars 
kryuchkov said he envisioned the day when the two superpowers 
would no longer spy on each other 
already he said we do not consider the united states of 
america our main enemy 
in the interview kryuchkov also said he did not want to see the 
kgb divided into foreign and domestic intelligencegathering 
operations along the lines of the fbi and cia 
he declined to disclose the kgb budget or the number of agents 
it employs citing similar secrecy on the part of us 
intelligence 
the supreme soviet parliament is drafting a law that would 
govern the actions of the kgb and give a legislative commission the 
right to learn all the agencys secrets similar to the select 
intelligence committees in the us congress he said 
already he said the ministry of finance has a special 
department that monitors the agencys expenditures

scientists today said big doses of the nutrient 
beta carotene fail to prevent skin cancer but that moms advice 
still holds eat your vegetables 
people who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables are less likely 
to get cancer and experts had suspected that their intake of beta 
carotene might explain this 
but a study published today in the new england journal of 
medicine found that beta carotene does not seem to be the key 
ingredient at least as far as skin cancer is concerned 
this conclusion should not however deter people from eating 
fruits and vegetables the researchers wrote 
beta carotene is the nutrient that makes carrots yellow and is 
found in varying degrees in many fruits and vegetables the body 
uses it to manufacture vitamin a which some believe can prevent 
cancer perhaps by trapping chemical compounds known as free 
radicals that can harm the bodys cells 
the researchers tested beta carotene pills on people who had 
been treated for basalcell or squamouscell skin cancer none had 
melanoma the far more dangerous malignant form of skin cancer the 
treatment did nothing to slow the growth of new skin cancers 
although our results provide no support for an anticancer 
effect of oral beta carotene on nonmelanoma skin cancer it would 
be unwise to conclude on the basis of this study alone that beta 
carotene is ineffective against all cancers the researchers 
wrote 
they noted other evidence to suggest that it might prevent lung 
cancer several other studies of beta carotene are also under way 
the study was directed by dr e robert greenberg of dartmouth 
medical school 
in the study 1805 people were randomly assigned to take 50 
milligrams of beta carotene or placebos each day for a year after 
five years of followup 362 people who took beta carotene and 340 
in the comparison group had at least one new skin cancer 
the researchers concluded that there is not enough evidence to 
prescribe the nutrient as an anticancer treatment 
a separate study in the journal by dr waun k hong of md 
anderson cancer center in houston showed that the acne drug 
accutane blocked the growth of new tumors in people being treated 
for smokingrelated cancer of the mouth and throat 
the report was widely publicized in may when it was presented in 
washington at a meeting of the american society of clinical 
oncology 
even after this cancer is initially removed patients risk 
getting new tumors elsewhere in their throats and lungs accutane 
an artificial form of vitamin a reduced the recurrence rate from 
24 percent in untreated patients to 4 percent in those getting the 
medicine

the housesenate conference committee working 
on the 1990 farm bill set acreage reduction for wheat at 15 percent 
this crop year as its first action toward melding the bills each 
body approved this summer 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced today a 15 
percent acreage setaside for the 1991 wheat crop previously he 
had said it was his intention to require a reduction of 10 percent 
to 20 percent 
yeutter said he was pleased that the conferees acted so 
quickly on this important issue for winter wheat growers who are 
now planting their 1991 crop 
the vote came wednesday at the urging of the agriculture 
department which needs to advise farmers planting winter wheat on 
the requirements they must follow to participate in the 
governments subsidy programs 
it followed an exchange of formalities between the chd food exports 
apparently to ensure the country has adequate 
supplies this winter 
leading members of the opposition union of democratic forces 
have said that the socialists would not meet their demands for 
participating in the cabinet 
the opposition seeks immediate privatization of land and 
industry and return of land to those who owned it before it was 
collectivized under communist rule the socialists agree to land 
reform but say land should be given to those who are tilling it 
now 
lukanovs cabinet contained only a handful of new faces but 
included the first new defense minister in 28 years lukanov 
replaced dobri dzhurov with yordan mutafchiev 
dzhurov was a close associate of former communist party chief 
todor zhivkov but was credited with helping party reformers remove 
the hardline leader in november 
science minister ilya konev is the only cabinet member not 
associated with the socialist party two others labor and social 
welfare minister emilia maslarova and culture minister dimo dimov 
are not formally members of the socialist party but were endorsed 
by the socialists when they ran for parliament

appearance among the troops of operation desert shield in saudi 
arabia and possibly stop in egypt and turkey to thank their leaders 
for cooperating against iraq 
in washington white house officials said they could not confirm 
the report and that no travel plans have been set 
thanksgiving was seen by white house advisers as a better time 
than christmas for bushs visit because it is a secular american 
holiday and less likely to upset saudi arabias conservative moslem 
leadership newsday said 
the visit would be part of a trip that tentatively would start 
in prague czechoslovakia and include the nov 19 paris summit of 
the 34 nations in the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe

city officials say no evidence exists that a 
large sign was to blame for the collapse of a downtown buildings 
wall that killed three people 
city officials and police initially blamed a large metal sign on 
the front of the any kind check cashing agency for tuesdays 
collapse which also injured eight people 
but cynthia bayete a spokeswoman for the citys department of 
licenses and inspections told the philadelphia inquirer in todays 
editions it appears now signs were not to blame 
the feeling is that the signs did not have anything to do 
with the collapse bayete said 
the departments commissioner don kligerman said earlier that 
the collapse apparently was triggered by the metal sign and steel 
security gates which he said were improperly fastened to the wall 
he said the twostory buildings owners were cited in june for a 
zoning violation 
but department officials said later that the violation involved 
a city art commission complaint over the signs lettering

japan has proposed sending a 1000member group 
that includes defense forces and retired military personnel to the 
persian gulf a newspaper reported today 
only about 100 of the proposed un peace cooperation corps 
would be members of the self defense forces japans military the 
newspaper asahi shimbun said citing unidentified government 
sources 
other members of the proposed group similar to a reserve unit 
would be retired military personnel and volunteers from local 
police and fire departments it said the team would limit itself 
to technical assistance such as medical service surveillance 
communications transport and construction news reports said 
the force would allow japan to contribute to the buildup in the 
persian gulf despite the nations ban on sending troops overseas 
japan as the worlds secondlargest economy has felt 
increasing pressure from the united states to move beyond its 
promise of 4 billion in gulf aid to a more active role 
some leading members of the governing liberal democratic party 
want to break free of the constitutional ban on using military 
force to settle international conflicts 
the party however has been weakened by a series of election 
setbacks it is afraid of igniting a fierce battle in parliament 
with the leading opposition socialist party which strongly opposes 
any change in the constitution or in the self defense forces law 
we will hve to be very careful how to handle this matter 
chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said today we have to 
make sure to build consensus within the party first 
in japan any prospect of renewed militarism usually arouses 
fear and bitterness 
it is an issue politicians like to avoid and the current un 
peace cooperation bill is being laboriously designed to skirt such 
constitutional questions 
the planned corps would report directly to the prime minister 
self defense forces personnel serving in the unit probably would 
assume a special status as civilian government employees 
in any case events in the gulf may bypass the governments 
political maneuvering officials say its likely to be at least 1 
months before the peace cooperation corps could be formed even if 
the bill sails smoothly through parliament

are with them

an avantgarde theater company was ordered to 
quit performing its play called the cardinal detoxes or face 
eviction by the landlord the roman catholic archdiocese of new 
york 
the rapp theater co part of the rapp arts center agreed in 
its lease with the church not to present such works in the 
building a former parochial school 
but r jeffrey cohen rapps founder and artistic director 
called the archdioceses threat an attempt at censorship and 
promised to fight it in court 
we will not buckle under the pressure cohen said my 
attorneys have been looking into it and they are convinced that the 
churchs position is unconstitutional as well as being 
unconscionable 
the play by thomas m disch drama critic of the nation is a 
35minute monologue about an archbishop who has been placed in a 
churchrun detoxification center because he has killed a pregnant 
woman in an auto accident while driving drunk 
the archbishop delivers a diatribe against church policies on 
abortion womens rights homosexuality and other issues 
cohen said the center received a letter monday from the 
archdiocese demanding the theater company immediately terminate 
the performance of the play because it violates the centers 
lease 
an archdiocese spokesman joseph zwilling said the letter did 
not amount to censorship 
the centers lease states that it acknowledges the church owns 
the land and that any activity offensive to the churchs principles 
would be detrimental to the landlords reputation he said 
this was agreed to by the tenant after extensive 
discussions zwilling said we went over this very carefully 
they said they would abide by these principles 
the rapp arts center is an experimental group that presents 
avantgarde theater music dance and film among those it has 
presented is performance artist karen finley who recently lost a 
grant from the national endowment for the arts after officials said 
her work would not enhance public understanding and appreciation 
of the arts 
cohen said he had not decided if he would defy the churchs 
order and present the play this friday and saturday nights

iraqs saddam hussein has recorded a 
message to the american people and his government has asked that 
it be broadcast by television networks in the united states the 
iraqi news agency reported today 
also today a turkish newspaper quoted saddam as saying iraq 
could fight for five or six years if war breaks out and can hurt 
america 
speaking of the international trade embargo against iraq the 
newspaper milliyet of istanbul quoted saddam as saying in an 
interview we are preparing ourselves for a blockade that could 
last for years we have fought for eight years against iran 
if necessary we can fight for another three to four years another 
five to six years 
saddam was also quoted as saying iraq knows that america is 
the no 1 superpower in the world but we also are confident that 
we can hurt america 
iraqs news agency did not provide any detail of the content of 
the saddams television message for the united states which is 
clearly a response to one by president bush that was broadcast by 
iraqi television on sunday 
it quoted information minister latif nassyif jassim as saying 
concerned american personalities have been contacted and asked to 
take delivery of the tape for broadcasting on american television 
channels 
jassim said the iraqi government still has not received a 
response to the request made on the basis of reciprocal 
treatment 
but if the united states blocks the attempt jassim said the 
concerned iraqi authorities will find alternative ways to transmit 
the message to the american people through international television 
stations 
in his statement he did not say when the message was taped or 
give its length 
bushs address to the iraqis was eight minutes long it was 
taped at the white house and delivered with arabic subtitles and an 
arabiclanguage voiceover the full text was broadcast on the iraqi 
television 
us officials have complained about the broadcast time given to 
saddams messages and staged appearances with western hostages 
particularly by the allnews american network cnn diplomats say 
they have helped garner support for iraq in the persian gulf 
standoff especially among radical arab masses 
responding to the complaint jassim offered bush time on the 
iraqi television 
in bushs weekend broadcast he said iraq stands isolated and 
alone now that the un security council has slapped sanctions on 
it as punishment for its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
saddam hussein tells you that the crisis is a struggle between 
iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world he said 
the speech sparked widespread anger among iraqis who poured 
into the streets of baghdad to shout death to bush death to 
america 
veteran iraqi announcer mikdad morad who reads many of saddams 
mesages called bushs message full of lies and contradictions

natos top official today criticized 
the western allies for not sending more ground forces and other 
assistance to the persian gulf region to support the huge american 
military buildup 
let me clearly state my personal opinion that some allies 
could and should do more said manfred woerner secretarygeneral 
of the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
it would be helpful if in addition to great britain and 
france also other allies could send ground troops to the gulf as 
suggested by the united states he said at a security conference 
sponsored by the us mission to nato 
secretary of state james a baker iii last week asked the 
alliance nations to deploy additional groundbased forces in the 
region even if it were only symbolic 
since then britain and france have announced they will send 
thousands of ground troops to the region but no other nato nations 
have joined in 
woerner said the gulf crisis has raised the question of whether 
nato should play a greater role in dealing with socalled regional 
or outofarea conflicts which affect the security of member 
nations 
under natos treaty member nations have agreed to consider an 
armed attack on any one of them in europe or north america as an 
attack against all of them it allows consultations for events 
occurring outside the area 
who could deny that the maintenance of an uninterrupted supply 
of oil is a vital issue for the security of all the members of the 
alliance he said

jewish young people temple beth israel and temple beth el said 
morrison

parliament today confirmed premier andrei 
lukanov allowing him to continue leading the government despite 
his failure to form a coalition with opposition parties 
the vote followed lukanovs address on national tv on wednesday 
night when he promised to seek quick passage of new laws to 
encourage private farming and end decades of state control of the 
economy 
lukanov appealed for unspecified practical measures to end 
state control of most sectors of the economy and replace it with 
private ownership he also said tax and banking reforms were needed 
to stimulate the private sector 
he specifically mentioned the need for a land act to boost the 
development of private farming 
opposition parties are seeking immediate privatization of land 
and industry and return of land to those who owned it before it 
was collectivized under communist rule the socialists who are 
former communists agree to land reform but say land should be 
given to those who are tilling it now 
earlier in the day the socialistdominated grand national 
assembly confirmed lukanov by a vote of 234104 with 28 
abstentions thirtyfour deputies were absent 
the rest of the cabinet ministers must be approved by parliament 
later it will be lukanovs second government in seven months 
lukanov repeatedly has urged the opposition to join in a 
coalition government to forge a program with wide backing in 
society but he was forced late wednesday to propose a new cabinet 
dominated by his party the socialists because of continuing 
opposition reluctance to participate 
leading members of the opposition union of democratic forces 
have said that the socialists would not meet their demands for 
participating in the cabinet 
the socialists are heirs to the longruling communists who 
chose the name change last spring along with departure from an 
authoritarian past and won a parliamentary majority in junes 
watershed free elections 
the socialists have since seen their popularity wane however 
because of bulgarias faltering economy 
some basic foodstuffs and consumer goods are in short supply or 
unavailable and the government began rationing of sugar cooking 
oil and other goods during the summer 
electricity is being rationed and the government this week 
banned food exports apparently to ensure the country has adequate 
supplies this winter 
lukanovs cabinet contained only a handful of new faces but 
included the first new defense minister in 28 years lukanov 
replaced dobri dzhurov with yordan mutafchiev 
dzhurov was a close associate of former communist party chief 
todor zhivkov but was credited with helping party reformers remove 
the hardline leader in november 
science minister ilya konev is the only cabinet member not 
associated with the socialist party two others labor and social 
welfare minister emilia maslarova and culture minister dimo dimov 
are not formally members of the socialist party but were endorsed 
by the socialists when they ran for parliament

a senior adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev 
said today the soviet union is eager to see the united states and 
cuba normalize their relations and is prepared to help in the 
process 
speaking to members of the associated press board of directors 
and associated press executives presidential council member 
yevgeny primakov also said the soviet union will not base future 
aid to cuba solely on the political consideration of keeping 
president fidel castro in power 
questions about cuba figured prominently in the wideranging 
discusion with primakov who also said the soviet union has 
stopped thinking of exporting revolution in any form asked if 
cuba has made a similar decision primakov said they are now 
reconsidering a lot of their policies 
he added that others presumably meaning the united states 
should absolutely forget about exporting counterrevolution 
primakov said the soviet union wants cuba to be a factor of 
stability in international politics and said his country would 
like to see the normalization of cubanamerican relations we are 
prepared to help bring this about he said 
asked if the decline of soviet aid to cuba could cause the fall 
of castro primakov said i dont think the castro government is 
that unstable 
he said cuba does not depend exclusively on aid from the soviet 
union and that trade between the two countries is mutually 
beneficial 
i dont think castro is competely dependent on the soviet 
union primakov said adding that the soviet union wont be 
completely guided by the political considerations of keeping castro 
in power as it reviews its aid and trade policies with cuba

senate majority leader george j mitchell said 
today a deficitreduction plan should include a cut in taxes on 
capital gains he later explained he was not advocating a 
reduction but spelling out conditions under which one might be 
approved 
president bushs repeated call for a capitalgains cut has been 
a major obstacle to agreement between the white house and 
congressional leaders on a deficitreduction plan mitchells 
allout opposition prevented approval of the capitalgains 
provision last year 
mitchell dmaine was being interviewed today on the cspan 
network when a telephone caller asked why since he favored a 
capitalgains cut in 1986 he now is so opposed 
i do believe that we should enact it as part of this 
deficitreduction package now but in a manner that makes it part 
of a fair and progressive tax structure and which does not increase 
the budget deficit mitchell responded 
meeting with reporters later mitchell denied that he now is 
advocating a capitalgains cut 
he said any reduction must meet the three tests it must be 
part of a fair and progressive system it should not bust the 
deficit and it should be targeted to investment and small 
business 
bush and other advocates of a cut in taxes on capital gains 
which are profits from the sale of investments say it is needed to 
promote investment and create jobs 
in the cspan interview mitchell noted that almost 80 percent 
of the direct benefits of such a cut would go to people with 
incomes above 100000 a year he said democrats are telling bush 
that if he is to win a capitalgains reduction it must be offset 
by raising taxes in other ways on the welltodo 
what we have suggested is that we accept a capitalgains 
differential but it be offset in some way so we dont have a 
situation where we ask all americans to sacrifice to deal with the 
budget deficit except those with incomes of 200000 a year or 
more mitchell said 
unless the wealthy are required to pay for a capitalgains cut 
he said the deficit would be worsened should we as the first 
and most important step in trying to reduce the deficit adopt a 
measure that will increase the deficit he asked 
republicans have proposed that the capitalgains cut be offset 
by limiting the itemized deductions of higherincome americans 
democrats have rejected that approach

a white supremacist organization asked that 
hatecrime laws be repealed and hinted that its members were 
responsible for a bombing which damaged the federal courthouse 
in a letter received tuesday by knsdtv a group called the holy 
church of the white fighting machine of the cross said it is 
seeking the nullification of all antiwhite laws pertaining to 
hate crimes it also asks that new trials be given to 
incarcerees due to hate crimes 
the previously unknown group did not specifically claim 
responsibility for last weekends bombing which blew out two glass 
courthouse doors its letter said that while no one was hurt the 
group cannot guarantee there will not be injuries in the 
future 
station officials turned the letter over to the fbi which is 
investigating the bombing 
obviously the existence of a letter does not prove anybody did 
the bombing said fbi agent gene riehl its just part of the 
investigation process 
in the latest instance of apparent hate crimes in the san 
francisco bay area students and staff at two schools in haywood 
said they were angered by bigoted symbols and slogans that were 
painted on the schools 
were outraged its something we wont tolerate in hayward or 
our high school said larry ratto principal at hayward high 
school which was painted with swastikas and racial epithets 
tuesday 
similar derogatory slogans and the letters kkk were painted on 
the king intermediate school on sunday police had no suspects 
in san diego authorities said four men described as 
militarylooking were seen running from the area of the 
downtown san diego courthouse shortly before a homemade bomb 
detnated about 1245 am saturday 
the onepage typewritten letter also says the usmexico 
border should be closed by the national guard to prevent illegal 
immigration 
a time frame of 30 days will be granted by white power to 
effect this before further action the letter said 
roberto martinez a highprofile immigrant rights activist in 
san diego also received a hate letter recently from the holy 
church of the white fighting machine of the cross 
martinez also is director of the usmexico border program in 
the san diego area for the american friends service committee the 
73yearold quaker organization carries out programs for peace and 
justice in 30 countries 
the letter to martinez is filled with expletives and racial 
slurs and warns him to stop criticizing the border patrol 
that letter was one of several that martinez said he has 
received along with threatening phone calls from more than one 
white supremacist group 
the letter to martinez is being investigated as a hate crime 
police said

the key to a successful driver 
education course is the key to a car say parents and students who 
have started a drive to have local schools keep using automobiles 
as teaching tools 
a 2467 million budget adopted tuesday by the leon county 
school board includes only 10000 for driver education school 
officials say 50000 is needed to buy the 14 cars the program 
would need 
one parent marie kokol is trying to get auto dealers to donate 
cars 
student kevin kahn has already donated his familys 1976 
plymouth valiant to the cause 
it doesnt look too good but it runs good and has a new 
battery the 14yearold said as he handed the keys to school 
officials at tuesdays board meeting the crowd of about 75 people 
applauded 
with money short leon county could be forced to teach its 
students to drive in the classroom instead of the car 
thats already the case in two other florida districts in palm 
beach and lake counties 
in palm beach classroom instruction is augmented by simulator 
training similar to the kind the army uses to teach soldiers to 
drive tanks said manny harageones a drivers education consultant 
with the state education department 
its a proven way to teach harageones said 
but john walker who supervises driver training for the 
district said he hopes to get students back into cars as soon as 
possible 
lake county superintendent beverly haskins says shes just as 
happy without the hassle of cars and few parents have complained 
students and parents at tuesdays meeting in leon county were 
complaining 
until we get behind the wheel theres nothing really that he 
can teach us 15yearold jeannie walker said of her driver

nelson mandela said today the 
african national congress would resist demands to give its 
supporters guns even though it understood their desire to defend 
themselves 
speaking to a mass funeral for 12 people killed in black 
factional fighting mandela called the desire for weapons 
reasonable he said it would be difficult to resist the demand 
but the anc would not hand out guns to untrained people 
anc supporters have been demanding weapons because of the savage 
street fighting in black townships around johannesburg that has 
claimed some 800 lives in the past month 
the more than 20000 people at jabulani stadium in soweto 
cheered when mandela the anc deputy president made a surprise 
appearance 
he and other top anc officials had been meeting since tuesday to 
discuss the violence and government responses to end it 
mandela criticized recent government security measures to stop 
the unrest saying they were intended to arm the white government 
and disarm liberation movements 
his wife winnie mandela arrived earlier and stood with the anc 
leaders on the stage the crowd sang revolutionary songs and 
chanted antiapartheid slogans 
police said today that 478 bodies from the weeks of fighting 
remained unclaimed in state mortuaries and would be disposed of 
soon in pauper funerals 
the soweto police spokesman capt mikhachane ngobeni told the 
independent south african press association that one mortuary 
contained 270 unclaimed bodies most of them unidentified 
the violence has eased in recent days 
police strung razor wire around the merafe hostel in soweto as 
part of measures to try to halt the fighting several dozen armed 
policemen patrolled outside the hostel 
president fw de klerk met wednesday with his cabinet and later 
announced new steps designed to curb the unrest including special 
investigative teams to probe specific incidents he also announced 
an amnesty for any group or individual surrendering illegal 
firearms and explosives by oct 1 
de klerks steps followed last weeks announcement of new police 
measures including roadblocks weapons searches isolating flash 
points such as workers hostels and squatter camps and sending in 
more police and soldiers 
mandela has predicted the police measures would be ineffective 
he also has said the anc could suspend peace talks with the 
whiteled government if security forces fail to halt the bloodshed 
the fighting has pitted xhosas and other blacks linked to the 
anc against zulu supporters of the conservative inkatha movement 
it spread from the eastern natal province the traditional zulu 
homeland where five years of clashes have killed more than 5000 
people 
sapa reported that several anc and inkatha officials met 
wednesday night in durban in natal to discuss the violence it 
was the first meeting between top officials of the two groups since 
1979

jeanclaude van damme the latest of the 
hardbodies to join the action movie market likes to say that he 
came to hollywood with my legs just as arnold schwarzenegger came 
with his muscles 
van damme claims that the comparison to top pectoralman 
schwarzenegger is minimal all the newspapers compare me to 
arnold but we are very different i came from belgium he came 
from austria they have tendency in the business always to compare 
people 
not without reason both men have a fanatical devotion to their 
bodies both are as shrewd as wall street lawyers about their 
careers and both have a charming faculty for mangling the english 
language 
but unlike schwarzenegger van damme would like future films to 
take a romantic turn 
i get lots of fan mails from ladies the belgian said 
they say we love your movies and love the action but we would 
like to see you in the romantic type of film with some feeling and 
some passion 
thats my next film double impact im going to play a 
twin he said im going to play a guy like a james bond very 
clean very charming in real life im very hyper a very 
happy person im always laughing in all those movies im very 
serious thats not my nature 
van dammes newest movie is mgmuas death warrant in which 
he plays an undercover cop from french canada which helps explain 
the accent railroaded into a california prison he defends 
himself with the only weapons available his feet 
born 29 years ago in brussels van damme began studying martial 
arts at 11 and became a middleweight champion as a teenager he 
also grew up loving movies and he left a thriving gym business to 
try his luck in hollywood he worked as limo driver carpet layer 
bouncer and karate instructor while seeking jobs in movies 
the problem was when i came in this country i wasnt legal 
he said when you dont have a green card you have to do all 
those jobs to make money im very legal now but it was very 
difficult 
its good in one sense because you can see whats going on in 
the bottom when you start in the bottom with lowbudget movies 
you have to work with everybody and you can see whats going on 
with the crew you respect all the people its a big family 
its not just you its a big family 
a villainous role in no retreat no surrender led to an 
alien part in schwarzeneggers predator then he became a star 
in cyborg bloodsport and kickboxer 
naturally the van damme films are popular in asia and hes 
beginning to pick up fans elsewhere 
i am growing all over very nicely he said not too fast 
not too slow just perfect nobody knew me in the us market 
before so they bought the movies in videos i started to have a 
relationship with the video people now they come to see me in 
theaters so its growing very nicely 
van damme realistically views the future the future will 
decide my destiny its whats on the screen that will pay off 
its difficult to say im going to do this or that im going to go 
with life 
the most important thing is to stay hungry i know its 
going to take time ive got to build a reputation ive got to 
connect with the people watching those movies and the press and 
everything its going to take time but i think i think ill 
be there

after devoting 20 years to his 
threevolume history of the civil war shelby foote figured he was 
finished with the era and could get back to work on his seventh 
novel 
enter documentary filmmaker ken burns who enlisted him as a 
commentator for the civil war the epic 11hour tv series 
starting sunday and running five nights on pbs 
suddenly a national audience has discovered shelby foote 
this civil war stuff is driving me crazy i thought i had my 
discharge he says in the quiet upstairs study where he wrote 
the final volume of his 3000page history the civil war a 
narrative 
people keep wanting me to come somewhere and speak and i enjoy 
it but i disapprove of it foote said im doing it but it 
really takes me out of my work 
foote 73 writes in longhand with an oldfashioned pen and 
inkwell aiming for 600 words a day it makes me take my time and 
get it right he said 
his used his southern storytellers touch in his history and 
his courtly mississippi drawl is the documentarys unifying voice 
he has a scholars insight and a sympathetic feeling for both sides 
of the conflict 
foote said he was drawn to the documentary by burns insistence 
on historical accuracy words like truth and accuracy come 
up often in a conversation with him without that he said 
youve got nothing 
narrative history foote said was the only way to write about 
the civil war narrative history is the kind that comes closest 
to telling the truth he said you can never get to the truth 
but thats your goal 
a threetime guggenheim fellow and recipient of a ford 
foundation fellowship foote finished his sixth novel september 
september in 1978 then he went to work on his reading he did 
nothing else for three years 
whenever i do anything that i consider gives me the right to 
do it i sit down and spend a month reading marcel proust he 
said ive read remembrance of things past eight times as a 
reward for various things 
foote grew up in greenville miss and was a lifelong friend of 
author walker percy a parttime jackleg reporter for hodding 
carter on the delta star he also edited his high school newspaper 
and was often at odds with his principal 
rejected by the university of north carolina in 1935 he learned 
that the principal was behind it but went to enroll anyway when 
i got to the desk they said we told you not to come i said i 
know you did but i didnt think you really meant it 
he stayed two years taking whatever courses he wanted 
regardless of their value for a degree after college he took 
makedo jobs and worked on his first novel with war on the 
horizon he joined the national guard in 1939 
foote was a field artillery captain training in northern ireland 
when a superior officer insulted one of my men on an inspection 
i made him apologize to the man he said 
not long after he was courtmartialed for falsifying a 
government record his mileage on a jaunt in military vehicle 
it cost him his commission he was discharged and returned to the 
united states 
foote worked in the new york bureau of the associated press but 
journalism didnt appeal to him 
he joined the marine corps the marines had a great time with 
me they said if you used to be a captain you might make a pretty 
good marine foote said the war ended before he made private 
first class 
he went back to greenville to write commercials for a radio 
station then i sold my first story to the saturday evening post 
i quit my job and havent had another one since he said 
footes first novel tournament begun before the war was 
published in 1949 then came follow me down in 1950 love in 
a dry season in 1951 shiloh in 1952 and jordan county in 
1954 
that year random house asked him to write a onevolume history 
of the civil war he took the job but soon realized it would 
produce nothing new he proposed a threevolume history 
they had various meetings i suppose he said and in a 
week or 10 days they wrote back and said go ahead i went ahead 
for the next 20 years 
 
elsewhere in televison 
time shifter alert set your vcrs for against the law

in childhood chef david liederman recalls his brother and his 
stepfather lunging forks first toward the last pork chop dad 
speared the brother and in the chaos liederman came up with the 
chop 
we were so eager to get to the portion that we barely tasted 
what we were eating and whatever hit the table was devoured as if 
hit by a buzz saw he said 
liederman was off on a decadeslong journey of devouring that 
eventually led him to map trips through france aimed at hitting as 
many threestar restaurants as possible at 38 he topped 300 
pounds 
he opened two new york city restaurants and a chain of chocolate 
chip cookie shops called davids cookies and though he has 
dropped 100 pounds kept it off for three years and writen a book 
davids delicious weightloss program he remains obsessed with 
food 
my biggest project in life is keeping from getting fat said 
liederman now 41 if you believe the way i do that compulsive 
eating is not only a sickness but an addiction how do you get rid 
of the problem without spending the psychological energy 
one therapist likened his situation to psychological 
tyranny but liederman for now is content 
he carries a pocket diary everywhere recording every single 
taste of food in tiny little letters down to the spoonful of clear 
broth and mushroom soup tasted at his broadway cafe he is fanatic 
about daily exercise usually with a trainer at 5foot11 and 
about 180 pounds he looks healthy and moves fast 
my goal in life is for someone to say you look terrible 
david eat something he said 
millions of americans feel an immediate affinity with those 
words half the adult women and 30 percent of adult men in this 
country are on a diet americans spent more than 30 billion trying 
to lose weight or keep it off last year and a congressional 
committee is investigating the industry 
still an estimated 34 million american adults are obese that 
is they weigh at least 20 percent above their ideal weight 
the aesthetic ideal is so lean and now athletic that its 
simply impossible for many people to attain that ideal said 
kelly brownell codirector of the obesity research clinic at the 
university of pennsylvania many people lose to a healthy weight 
but they dont feel satisfied 
they push beyond to the aesthetic ideal and their body fights 
back their body wins and they end up at a higher weight 
americans turn to selfhelp books relaxation techniques 
overeaters anonymous weight watchers modified fasts liquid 
diets liposuction wired jaws stapled stomachs grapefruits 
acupuncture hypnotism fatty photos on the refrigerator fake 
fats artificial sugars jogging spas aerobics stairmasters 
gyms drugs 
dieting is part of the mainstream going off a diet is failing 
that philosophy is part of the problem according to therapists 
who say food represents other problems if people learned to eat to 
ease hunger for food rather than hunger for love or something 
else most eventually would reach a weight thats good for them 
they say 
financially emotionally and physically americans are paying 
for being so persistently and obsessively focused on an ideal they 
most likely will never attain why 
for one thing women and men to a lesser extent are victims of 
a culture that worships a sylphlike figure to the virtual exclusion 
of other body types 
you cant work with women and not work with eating problems 
body image said andrea gitter a therapist at the womens 
therapy center institute in new york city who specializes in eating 
problems 
it touches on everybodys insecurity the underlying message 
is that youre not ok as you are said gitter who was a 
compulsive eater until she learned to eat to satisfy physical 
hunger rather than to stave off guilt loneliness or other 
emotional longings 
women often believe that if they are thin if they control their 
appetites they will be happy loved and respected kim chernin 
writes in the obsession 
losing weight hillel schwartz argues in his book never 
satisfied has become the modern expression of an industrial 
society confused by its own desires and therefore never 
satisfied 
the obsession strikes girls early a 1986 study in san francisco 
found that of 500 girls in grades 4 to 12 almost 80 percent of 
10and 11yearolds reported dieting to lose weight 
and many parents have overreacted to researchers warnings that 
televisionaddicted children would grow obese nutritionists had to 
admonish parents not to take all the fat out of their childrens 
diets 
that provides a glimpse at one of the strange aspects of 
americas obsession with weight one need not be overweight to live 
a lifetime dieting 
few people feel content with their bodies 
a sort of daily tally sheet is set up an hour pedaling the 
exercise bike equals a dish of haagen dazs no breakfast makes 
fries ok at lunch a husky guy buys a bag of chips stuffs a few 
handfuls in his mouth and tosses the bag in a sidewalk trash bin 
before he eats too many 
every ounce oprah winfrey or liz taylor gain and lose is watched 
by an america gleeful that the famous are no better than we are at 
keeping thin 
most people believe thin people get paid better get more dates 
live longer have fewer diseases but chernin notes this sense of 
wellbeing is precarious since most of those who lose weight put 
it all back and more 
the solution remains as elusive as the diet that lets you eat 
what you want and lose weight 
the history of the diet industry in america probably 
represents one of the most astounding triumphs of 20thcentury 
capitalist enterprise joan jacobs brumberg writes in fasting 
girls 
there is nothing that isnt sold without a thin female body 
next to it says susan gutwill also with the womens therapy 
center institute its really immoral its criminal in a very 
serious way 
the 32 billion spent to get thin last year is 10 billion more 
than was spent just four years ago and marketdata enterprises a 
research firm in valley stream ny predicts the market will top 
50 billion by 1995 
research may provide more clues to the causes of obesity but 
one fact doesnt change to lose weight and keep it off you must 
develop healthy eating and exercise habits for good the experts 
say 
even then you may have to accept a body chunkier than a 
models

yoyo dieting repeatedly losing and regaining weight may be 
more dangerous to the cardiovascular system than remaining somewhat 
overweight and may even promote weight gain researchers say 
longterm dieters also need to become educated about nutrition 
for example while the typical american diet includes about 40 
percent of its calories from fat many experts recommend 20 percent 
to 30 percent 
they really have very little idea what a portion size means in 
terms of cutting it xavier pisunyer director of the obesity 
research center at st lukesroosevelt hospital in new york said 
in a recent speech they have very little idea of how much fat is 
in a food they eat or how much sugar there is in a food they eat 
liederman knows his nutrition exercises daily and appears to 
have motivation in abundance but will he keep his weight off 
i could regress i could find some rationale i cant 
foresee liederman said i could still fall off the wagon 
frightening to a dieter 
by world war i when this country had its first bestselling 
diet book there also was a us food administration herbert 
hoover as its head called on the nation to eat less 
fatness was careless selfish wasteful treacherous and 
unamerican schwartz wrote there was to the culture of 
slimming between 1930 and 1960 an element of fear that the more one 
had the emptier one would be 
in 1952 the director of the national institutes of health 
declared obesity the primary national health problem in 1960 a 
fitness enthusiast called jack lalanne had the largest national 
daytime television show audience and before the decade was out a 
skinny model called twiggy became an idol 
obesity today is considered a major health problem associated 
with heart disease diabetes high blood pressure joint problems 
and other diseases much however remains unknown 
we dont yet understand how most heavy people get to be 
heavy brownell said 
genetics metabolism culture psychology and other things all 
play a role but their relative importance is not fully understood 
although some people are heavy simply because they eat too much and 
exercise too little many fat people however eat no more than 
thin people their bodies seem to use calories less efficiently 
maintaining weight loss seems harder than losing it estimates 
of the recidivism rate commonly top 90 percent though brownell 
suspects that is too high especially for hospitalbased 
comprehensive programs 
these are odds to attract only the foolhardiest bettor but in 
dieters hope springs eternal 
david liederman faces his obsession his way every day theres 
his theater district restaurant the broadway cafe his east side 
french restaurant chez louis and davids cookies little takeout 
shops where the huge chunks of chocolate ooze out of the dough 
when i was over 300 pounds i convinced myself i had to taste 
each batch of cookies this one might be different than that 
one liederman said 
until his doctor told him he might not live to see his daughters 
grow up 
neither of his young daughters is overweight but he is 
vigilant 
it scares me because i know what it did to me he said if 
i didnt have this problem id be a lot more productive

a congressional subcommittee resumes its investigation into the 
diet industry which critics say government has given too much 
freedom 
in the 1970s at least 58 deaths were blamed on very lowcalorie 
liquid diet programs todays programs are safer though 
complications still are possible according to a recent study 
published in the journal of the american medical association 
they have always focused on losing weight fast but the 
medical community is overwhelming in the view that for the majority 
of people losing weight fast can do them more harm than good 
said us rep ron wyden dore chairman of a house subcommittee 
on regulation business opportunities and energy the subcommittee 
held two hearings in the spring on health risks false advertising 
and profiteering in the diet industry 
if people look beyond the promised land approach plus we 
can get the federal regulatory agencies to do their job were on 
the way to a more sensible approach wyden who at 6foot4 and 
165 pounds never has dieted to lose weight said in a telephone 
interview 
at mondays hearing the subcommittee will consider enforcement 
efforts aimed at diet promotions and marketing dieting among 
adolescents and whether restrictions or warnings are needed for 
laxatives and other products used to lose weight and chemical 
additives in diet products 
in a subcommittee staff memo to wyden the lack of federal funds 
for research into obesity is noted cumulatively basic diet 
research at the federal level totals about 12 million per year 
and research directed specifically at obestity treatment consumes 
another 2 million annually 
this the memo notes is from an overall national institutes of 
health research budget of 65 billion 
about adolescents the memo says that while diets are not 
targeted toward teenagers young people misuse readily available 
and uncontrolled diet products as a means of furthering dangerous 
diet practices 
in the face of the significant public health problem presented 
by obesity federal policy remains fragmented and undeveloped 
diulted and dwarfed in comparision to the research effort on less 
widespread health concerns according to the memo

diet and health with a key to the calories published in 
1918 and written by a physician was the first bestselling diet 
book in this country according to joan jacobs brumbergs history 
of anorexia 
its full of good humor but makes it cleaeal 
had already taken hold the author lulu hunt peters uses names 
like mrs sheesasite whose husband bought her freight scales 
mrs tiny weyaton and mrs ima gobbler 
some excerpts 
to her readers whor that a thin id want to gain weight she says 
i am not 
particularly interested in you anyway for i cannot get your point 
of view how anyone can want to be anything but thin is beyond my 
intelligence 
now fat individuals have always been considered a joke but 
you are a joke no longer instead of being looked on with friendly 
toleranace and amusement you are now viewed with distrust 
suspicion and even aversion how dare you hoard fat when our nation 
needs it 
yes you eat too much no matter how little it is even if 
it be only one bird seed daily if you store it away as fat 
and between you and me mrs weyaton just confidential like 
dont tell it we know that the small appetite story is a medicine 
thats obviously good news for people who want to reduce fat 
intake and it also may pay off for weightwatchers she said 
the federally financed study focused on six men who spent 24 
hours a day for 13 days in a laboratory where researchers could 
precisely measure what they ate the men did not know the purpose 
of the study and they were kept busy with a variety of tasks 
each man ate a highfat 844calorie lunch during one threeday 
period and a lowfat 431calorie lunch in another period both 
lunches consisted of submarine sandwiches and salad the men could 
not distinguish between the two versions 
beginning one hour after lunch the men could choose from a 
variety of foods to eat analysis showed that if they had eaten the 
lowcalorie lunch they later made up the difference in calories 
mostly at dinnertime 
but no such compensation occurred for fat rolls said that 
suggests fat substitutes certainly are going to be an aid to help 
people to try to reduce fats in foods she said 
hopkins researcher richard foltin lead author of the study 
cautioned that the men were not free to eat whatever they wanted 
for lunch so the evidence is only suggestive that in everyday 
life lowfat food would reduce total fat intake he said 
adam drewnowski director of the human nutrition program at the 
university of michigans school of public health called the study 
valuable 
he also said nobody knows what happens to overall fat intake 
when people know they are eating lowfat products 
rolls said she doubts those people make up for missing fat i 
dont think people think in terms of i want to eat fat she 
said 
although the study found no difference in calorie intake the 
reduction in calories from fat may still be good news for those 
trying to lose weight 
recent research suggests calories from fat are more fattening 
than those from carbohydrates that is because the body uses less 
energy to convert fat calories to body fat than it uses to convert 
carbohydrate calories rolls said 
in theory then cutting back on fat may help in losing weight 
beyond just the effect on reducing calorie intake she said 
fat substitutes hit the headlines in february when the food and 
drug administration approved a substitute called simplesse for use 
in frozen desserts simplesse is made by nutrasweet co 
kraft general foods inc is also seeking fda approval for a fat 
substitute to be used in frozen desserts 
another proposed substitute olestra could be used in cooking 
olestra is not absorbed by the body so it would not contribute any 
fat or calories says its developer procter amp gamble co 
the company proposes that olestra replace some fat in oil and 
shortening used in the home and in commercial frying 
fritolay inc is studying an experimental fat substitute 
dialkyl dihexadecymalonate which it says cuts fat by 60 percent 
when blended with oil for frying tortilla and potato chips

despite a new focus on being healthy rather than 
merely thin anorexia and bulimia continue to haunt young women 
and the number of men who suffer from eating disorders appears to 
be growing 
the last decade was full of images of the dangers of eating 
disorders on television and in movies and womens magazines 
an anorexic teenager was a character in the movie down and 
out in beverly hills jane fonda told the world she had suffered 
from bulimia karen carpenter lost her life to an eating disorder 
even a saturday night live skit included an anorexic cookbook 
the diseases have not gone away though experts say estimates at 
the time that 30 percent of college women suffered from them were 
exaggerated and new pressures have come to bear on those who are 
susceptible 
its not good enough just to be thin but one has to have 
muscles in the right places for a man or a woman you get into the 
fat content of your body how much muscle tone said leonard s 
levitz clincal director of the renfrew center in philadelphia 
which in 1985 became the first residential facility for treatment 
of eating disorders 
so now there is exercise bulimia in which sufferers turn to 
extraordinary amounts of exercise rather than or in addition to 
laxatives or vomiting 
anorexia is estimated to be two to four times as common today as 
30 years ago bulimia also appears to be more common the best 
estimates seem to be that 1 percent to 3 percent of college women 
are afflicted levitz said 
anorexia nervosa is characterized by selfstarvation an intense 
fear of becoming fat and a feeling that one is fat despite being 
emaciated bulimia involves a pattern of binge eating followed by 
purging by vomiting or with diruetics 
although anorexia was identified in 1873 by a london physician 
there is a centurieslong history of women controlling their 
appetites joan jacobs brumberg wrote in her book fasting 
girls 
in the 1300s st catherine of siena was said to eat only a 
handful of herbs a day in the midieval period fasting was central 
to female holiness 
bulimia however is newer becoming epidemic only in 1973 or 
1974 when a lot of trends came together in terms of broad 
societal issues concern over body weight role of women people 
being under tremendous pressure to be perfect the breakdown of 
family life levitz said 
a victim feels powerless in the world no sense of control of 
her life and a real fear that if her eating like her emotions 
got out of control who knows what would happen levitz said 
treatment generally is an intensive combination of therapy 
education and behavior modification 
these generally are diseases of intelligent women found in the 
middle and upper classes of developed countries the incidence 
appears to be increasing in scandinavia japan and germany 
new research is showing that many of those who suffer from 
eating disorders dieted as preteenagers were sexually abused or 
abuse drugs or alcohol levitz said also linked to the disease are 
such issues as fear of growth into womanhood 
at adolescence girls come to think of the normal changes 
occurring in their bodies as fatness and enter a war of wills to 
control them boys however take pride in their growth 
the overwhelming majority of people with eating disorders are 
women but experts say more and more men are afflicted 
particularly those involved in weightconscious pursuits like 
wrestling dancing or modeling 
is there a way out 
said levitz yes i think theres a way and i used to be more 
hopeful about it happening the main thing we have to do is change 
peoples perceptions of how you deal with different body weights 
how you look is a part of how you are as a person and there are 
many many other things that are equally or more important

at 300 pounds helen weighs a little more than 
shed like but at 280 she feels ok she just thinks its too bad 
everyone doesnt see her the way she sees herself 
i was raised to judge myself my own success said helen 
who spoke on condition her full name not be used its how do i 
feel and i feel good about myself 
helen 49 credits a positive atmosphere during her childhood 
people tell her she looks 35 and she jokes that if she loses 
weight all the wrinkles will show up 
helen wears sexy bathing suits dances has no trouble 
attracting men and is becoming something of an activist by speaking 
out as a member of the nonprofit national association for the 
advancement of fat acceptance 
founded in 1969 naafa has about 3000 members in this country 
and canada its aim is to spread the word that everyone no matter 
their weight has a right to a life of dignity and happiness 
it does not advocate dieting and tries to debunk myths such as 
that you can lose 10 pounds on a weekend said barbara altman 
bruno a clinical social worker in suburban pleasantville who 
treats women with weight problems 
people are meant to be all different shapes and sizes like 
vegetables bruno said i dont think everyone is meant to be 
thin 
helen said she encounters too many people who dont believe 
that people are taught or conditioned to get their image from 
the outside world she said 
i learned over the years at least in relationships with men 
because i have selfconfidence and i like myself whether im fat 
or thin i attract all sorts of men she said 
i happen to be a very pretty woman but i would say i feel a 
little more protected when im a heavy woman i sort of attract 
nicer men men who are not only interested in appearances helen 
said 
helen has successfully separated her selfworth from her weight 
said bruno who sets that goal for the people she treats 
we are so blinded by fear and hatred of fat in this country 
she said 
america naafa believes considers discrimination against fat 
people a safe prejudice that manifests itself in fashion 
availability of insurance mistreatment by health professionals and 
nasty jokes 
in the face of their obesity our normal standards of humanity 
vanish and we are possessed by a form of racist revulsion for the 
bodies of these women kim chernin writes in the obsession a 
philosophical look at the ways women view thin and fat 
women are still more valued for how they look than what they 
do even though thats been starting to shift as women become 
more prominent professionally and are less reliant on a man for an 
identity bruno said 
most women think theyre too fat because the ideal is 
impossible for most of them advertising tells us that to be 
acceptable as women were supposed to be size six and 22 years 
old bruno said 
helen and bruno said they see some positive changes 
some people are starting to get smart about the 
ineffectiveness of diets and liquid diets bruno said with the 
national emphasis on cutting back o fat and cholesterol a little 
of that is being absorbed by some people 
more stores carry fashionable clothing for large women and 
doctors and employers are changing their attitudes toward heavy 
people helen said 
still most experts believe obesity is unhealthy contributing 
to illnesses including heart disease and heavy people face other 
problems 
in glen burnie md in august a 367pound woman was required 
to take a driving test because authorities thought she might be too 
fat to drive safely regina guy passed the test but was angry 
fat people are human we deserve equal treatment said guy 
25 who was supported by several naafa members because of my 
size i should not be discriminated against 
her lawyer christopher brown said it was a clear case of 
discrimination the only reason she was singled out was because 
of her weight he said 
naafa also tries to break a common cycle faced with their own 
distress and the disdain of those around them overweight people 
diet lose weight go off the diet and get fat over and over 
many experts warn against such yoyo dieting as dangerous as 
well as counterproductive when regaining weight people often end 
up fatter than ever 
kelly brownell in research at the university of pennsylvania 
school of medicine found rats took more than twice as long to lose 
weight the second time around the difference may be a decrease in 
metabolic rate as the body tries to preserve itself against what 
it perceives as starvation 
as far as im concerned diets contribute greatly to 
compulsive overeating and to people getting fatter bruno said 
the yoyo syndrome brought tragedy to helens life she 
believes 
she and a boyfriend once lost weight together in months he 
lost 75 pounds and regained 60 soon he had fatal heart attack 
in the depression that followed helen regained her weight too 
but bruno noted that fat people have a lower suicide rate than 
thin people for some people food is a way to assuage a lot of 
painful feelings it works its legal and relatively 
inexpensive she said food happens to be very useful in its 
place and delicious

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told 
congress that the persian gulf crisis has piled new and 
substantial risks on an already faltering national economy 
in a generally gloomy assessment of us economic prospects 
greenspan said wednesday that the jump in oil prices since iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait had increased the threat of both higher 
inflation and a recession 
greenspan did not signal that the fed either had eased credit 
already or was planning any immediate easing moves 
instead he merely repeated comments made in the past that 
financial markets would respond favorably to a credible deficit 
reduction package by pushing longterm rates such as mortgage 
rates lower and the fed would do its part by helping to lower 
shortterm rates 
 
washington ap housing starts fell 17 percent in august to 
the lowest level since the last recession eight years ago 
although were not technically at a recessionary level i 
would describe the industry as in a recession martin regalia an

recession is a very technical term that gives very little solace 
to an individual who has to live and breathe in a particular 
market

recent reports of big arms sales to countries 
in the middle east may be exactly whats needed for us weapons 
contractors looking to offset cuts in domestic defense spending 
analysts say 
possible purchases of american jet fighters tanks missiles and 
other equipment by saudi arabia israel and even the tiny united 
arab emirates has lifted some clouds hovering over the defense 
industry 
there are still a lot of unknowns but our future looks a lot 
brighter than it did six months ago said don gilleland a 
spokesman for general dynamics corps tankbuilding division in 
sterling heights mich 
news accounts suggest the saudis want between 18 billion and 
23 billion worth of weapons in response to the threat from 
neighboring iraq israel has requested faster delivery of and 
additional planes and helicopters 
gilleland said hes heard speculation that the united arab 
emirates is interested in buying 250 tanks 
about 20 billion would be a nice shot in the arm for the 
defense industry i understand it would be pretty farreaching 
too said lawrence harris a stock analyst for bateman eichler 
hill richards inc a los angelesbased investment firm 
but the longterm future of the defense industry is going to 
remain a function of us defense spending industry and not that of 
foreign countries harris said 
foreign sales wont prevent scheduled layoffs by the major 
contractors but they may buy time for the industry to adjust to 
changes at the pentagon 
analysts said the persian gulf military buildup may help prevent 
deep cuts in he defense budget currently under discussion in 
congress but wont change the trend toward shrinking the amount of 
money americans pay for the military 
offsetting that continuing decline with foreign orders is the 
challenge for the nations defense contractors analysts said 
three months ago that may have seemed unlikely with the cold war 
turned tepid but the persian gulf crisis has changed things again 
the nations two biggest contractors mcdonnell douglas corp 
and general dynamics both stand to benefit from the reported 
sales as will smaller contractors elsewhere 
mcdonnell douglas based in st louis makes the f15e jet 
fighter which both the saudis and israelis want the plane has 
never been sold to another country though its predecessor the 
f15c is flown in japan israel and saudi arabia 
company aides declined to comment on the possibility of 
increased sales to other countries 
the f15e program is scheduled to build its final plane in 
mid1992 although industry analysts expect the us orders to keep 
production going until mid1993 foreign sales could keep the 
program alive into 1996 
nows the time to make hay while the suns shining lets get 
those orders nailed down and maybe we can stop any more layoffs 
down the road said cassell williams president of the companys 
largest union the international association of machinists amp 
aerospace workers 
his union which consists of almost 11000 production and 
maintenance workers has largely escaped the sweeping layoffs at 
mcdonnell douglas which announced a plan in july to cut up to 
17000 jobs nationwide and save 700 million this year 
about 100 of the unions members have been laid off williams 
said 
the big cuts at the aerospace giant came at the whitecollar 
level with middle managers and engineers baring the brunt new 
overseas orders arent likely to help them 
the layoffs are being driven by our need to improve 
profitability not by declines in the defense budget said 
barbara anderson a company spokeswoman that means the upturn in 
military sales would have very little impact on the layoffs 
at general dynamics based in the st louis suburb of clayton 
speculation about foreign orders for m1a2 tanks f16 jets and 
stinger missiles also wont reverse plans to lay off 1500 to 2000 
workers at two missile plants in southern california by the end of 
1991 spokesman christopher schildz said 
we have not received any immediate significant sales as a 
result of the persian gulf crisis and we have no way of predicting 
how the crisis will affect future sales schildz said 
its the same story at lockheed corp based in calabasas 
calif which manufactured nearly all the transport planes used to 
move eguipment and troops to the middle east and makes the 
radarfooling stealth aircraft that have been sent to the region 
the company already has cut 5500 jobs this year and is planning 
another 1700 cuts to bring companywide employment to about 75000 
at the end of the year

general motors corps proposed pact 
with the united auto workers union would be too expensive for 
chrysler corp to match executives say 
gm may have deep pockets and we dont chrysler motors 
chairman bennett bidwell said wednesday 
chrysler especially objects to healthcare provisions in the 
pact which the union hopes to use as a pattern for contracts with 
ford motors co and chrysler the gmuaw agreement carries over 
healthcare provisions from the latest contract 
healthcare costs are a big issue at chrysler which has more 
retirees and an older work force than gm or ford motors co 
chrysler has about 60000 active uawrepresented employees and 
almost the same number of retirees who typically file more health 
claims than younger active workers 
executives at chrysler which spent 684 million on health care 
last year have said since bargaining began july 20 they would find 
it difficult to follow a pattern set with the larger more 
profitable gm or ford 
but the pattern tradition is essential for the uaw chrysler 
workers are wearing buttons saying pattern or picket 
im hopeful that reasoned minds can come up with some ways to 
ease that burden a little bit without shattering the concept of 
pattern bidwell said 
the uaw and gm reached a tentative labor agreement early monday 
two days after expiration of the existing contracts between the uaw 
and the big three talks with ford and chrysler were put on hold 
pending the outcome of gm talks and wont resume until the gm 
contract is voted on by rankandfile union members later this 
month 
the automakers said when they opened national contract 
negotiations with the uaw last july that healthcare costs would be 
a major issue 
at the opening of uawchrysler negotiations company vice 
president anthony st john proposed a multiemployer healthcare 
trust to hook chrysler up with other companies the result would be 
a large healthcare group able to get lower health care rates by 
volume

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden has enrolled british and japanese regulators in 
his campaign to raise the amount of capital investors must put up 
to buy stock index futures on credit 
officials from japan and britain joined breeden wednesday in 
issuing a joint communique that called stated the need to maintain 
balance between stock markets and the markets for derivative 
products such as stock index futures contracts through higher 
margins 
the joint statement was issued following 1days of meetings at 
a conference center in the rolling hill country of northern 
virginia 
in attendance were john redwood undersecretary for corporate 
affairs of britains department of trade and industry david 
walker chairman of the securities and investment board for the 
united kingdom and nobuhiko matsuno directorgeneral of japans 
securities bureau of the ministry of finance 
given the internationalization of the worlds securities 
markets we felt it was important for the regulatory authorities of 
the three largest markets to have an opportunity to meet and review 
common concerns and common objectives breeden told reporters 
after the session ended 
in their first threeway meeting the regulators pledged to 
encourage trading among their countries and expand their 
cooperative supervision of it to strengthen formal agreements on 
the exchange of investigative information 
but the section on margin levels was a small political coup for 
breeden who has been urging higher margins for stock index futures 
in this country 
stock index futures are a hybrid financial product that allow an 
investor to bet on the rise or fall of a number of stocks without 
having to buy the underlying securites that make up the index 
and a margin is the down payment paid by an investor buying 
securities or futures contracts on credit in the us securities 
markets margins are set by the federal reserve board and are as 
high as 50 percent of the securities price in the futures 
markets margins are set by the exchanges themselves and are 
generally far lower 
breeden and other critics of low futures margins claim they 
encourage risky trading practices that lead to sharp price swings 
in the markets 
in their communique the three regulators said that margin 
levels for stock index futures and other derivatives should be 
adequately high in the event of a sharp market decline 
at a press briefing at the georgian revival mansion where the 
conference was held walker one of the british officials said they 
were glad to participate in a discussion of the general 
philosophy of margin control 
while londons stock index futures and options markets were 
growing extremely rapidly the rate of growth was much less than 
in the united states or japan 
matsuno said japan had recently raised margin levels from 9 
percent to 15 percent so as to recover the imbalance between the 
cash markets and the derivative markets although we have seen 
no notable effects of this 
the united states has had memorandums of understanding with 
securities regulators in both britain and japan since 1986 but 
those pacts are limited in scope compared to subsequent agreements 
reached with other countries such as brazil and switzerland to 
exchange information and assist each others investigations of 
fraud and other violations 
breeden said the focus of wednesdays meeting was not reaching 
specific agreement on policy matters but on clearing away 
obstacles 
in addition to margin levels the regulators agreed to encourage 
crossborder business between markets in their countries by 
pursuing mutual recognition of regulatory systems including 
disclosure requirements and systems for clearing and settling 
transactions 
they also agreed to exchange information on a regular basis to 
the extent possible within legislative constraints to monitor 
multinational firms operating in all three countries they renewed 
their intention to assist each others investigations into 
securities law violations 
the three said they have agreed to meet again in britain in the 
late spring or early summer

despite cutbacks intended to save tens of 
millions of dollars pan am corp faces turbulent times in a market 
that is proving tough even for healthier airlines 
pan am said wednesday it will eliminate 2500 jobs from pan 
american world airways in a bid to become leaner and stronger 
the troubled carrier will also reduce its capacity by 75 
percent next year through a series of moves that will include the 
loss of some routes and the replacement of five large airplanes on 
transatlantic flights with smaller planes that use less fuel 
pan am chairman thomas g plaskett said the cutbacks will occur 
as pan am seeks to concentrate more business in miami and latin 
america where its profits are the greatest but pan ams success 
in becoming stronger is far from certain analysts said 
this is going to be a difficult thing for them to do but its 
not impossible said george james president of airline economics 
inc an aviation consulting firm in washington 
we face tough times pan am spokesman jeffrey f kriendler 
acknowledged 
plaskett said pan ams changes are being made in response to 
rising jet fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel that have 
delt a particularly hard blow to ailing carriers pan am reported 
losses of about 2 billion during the 1980s and recent efforts to 
find a merger partner met no immediate success 
pan am plans by mid october to eliminate the 2500 jobs from 
the ranks of management and labor that now total about 29000 
about 500 management jobs will be scrapped kriendler said 
about half the cutback will likely be accomplished through 
layoffs while pan am hopes to achieve the rest through attrition 
and voluntary leaves of absence pan am was still trying to figure 
out where to make all the cuts which will force remaining 
employees to work harder kriendler said 
we know there will be no pilots affected kriendler said 
about 550 are flight attendants but all have agreed to take 
voluntary leaves of absence for three to nine months 
kriendler declined to offer more specifics about where the cuts 
might be made he said pan am hopes to save tens of millions of 
dollars but he would not be more precise 
the teamsters union which represents about 6500 of the pan am 
workers issued a statement through its airline division on 
wednesday saying pan am has indicated about 650 teamsters would be 
laid off 
teamsters have periodically conducted scattered strikes against 
pan am in recent months and the union said wednesday it was hoping 
to stop truck deliveries at the key kennedy airport operation in 
new york and other pan am locations 
teamsters local leaders were meeting in washington to discuss a 
more comprehensive strategy against pan am 
the airline said its other moves were intended to reduce 
capacity by 75 percent in 1991 
pan am will eliminate unprofitable feeder service into new 
yorks kennedy from philadelphia pittsburgh austin and san 
antonio texas and cincinnati pan ams commuter subsidiary pan 
am express would keep flying from pittsburgh and philadelphia into 
kennedy plaskett told airline analysts during an afternoon 
meeting 
as part of the cutbacks pan am will stop leasing five of the 
412seat boeing 747s now in its fleet of 35 and replace them with 
a310300s that carry less than half as many passengers but also 
use less fuel 
plaskett said the larger planes are ideal for peak summer 
travel but the smaller planes are more profitable on an annual 
basis they will be assigned to flights from kennedy to milan 
italy and madrid as well as on flights from washingtondulles to 
frankfurt and london 
pan am said it plans to get two new models of the smaller planes 
for next summers peak season flying them from new york to zagreb 
yugoslavia and from newark nj to london 
although the carriers capacity will be down by 75 percent 
departures will be down just 35 percent and the number of miles 
flown will be down 23 percent when pan ams cutbacks are all put 
in place by april kriendler said

the channel one news show is back in operation 
delivering 12 minutes a day of topical teenoriented stories along 
with pitches for candy sneakers and chips to classrooms in 45 
states 
creators of channel one say they are more than halfway toward 
their goal of signing 8000 schools but they have failed to shake 
the critics who contend it is wrong to deliver a captive audience 
of students to advertisers 
meanwhile an advertisingfree daily news program for use in the 
schools from the producers of cable news network is claiming a 
growing following 
more than 12000 schools have indicated interest in using the 
program cnn newsroom in the classroom and executives at turner 
broadcasting system inc say their surveys indicate about half of 
those schools are using it regularly 
other cable tv networks such as cspan the discovery channel 
and the learning channel are either producing shows or stepping up 
efforts to promote existing adfree services for use in the 
classroom 
but it was channel one the commercial program from whittle 
communications of knoxville tenn that ignited a passionate 
debate about televisions proper role in classroom education 
whittle tested its program in six schools in the spring of 1989 
and made it available to schools nationwide starting this past 
march 
schools that agreed to show the program to all of their students 
every day got a loan of videocassette recorders tv monitors for 
every classroom and wiring to tie the system together they get to 
keep the equipment as long as they keep showing the program 
thats been a tempting proposition for many schools that whittle 
says would otherwise be poorly equipped to make use of tv programs 
that could help students learn 
it is paying for the equipment and the costs of producing the 
daily news show by selling up to two minutes of commercial time in 
each 12minute show 
after taking the summer off channel one resumed programming at 
the end of august with an advertiser lineup that includes mampmmars 
inc nike inc fritolay inc magnavox electronics and columbia 
pictures 
some advertisers have simply run ads touting products but nike 
has used some time for antidrug messages and burger king corp is 
using all its time for ads to discourage school dropouts 
the shows itself use flashy graphics maps and often tell 
stories from a teen perspective arab teens in the mideast were 
interviewed in the wake of iraqs invasion of kuwait about how 
their lives had been changed 
farrell reynolds a onetime turner broadcasting executive who 
now oversees whittles educational operations said about 4200 
schools have signed threeyear contracts to take channel one and 
that 3500 are actually receiving it 
he said those schools have more than 31 million students and 
are in every state except maine rhode island nevada alaska and 
hawaii 
public schools in new york rhode island and california have 
been told they can either not accept adsupported programs such as 
channel one or risk losing state funds by carrying it but reynolds 
said parochial schools in the new york and los angeles areas have 
signed up 
he said it is becoming easier to sell the program to schools and 
advertisers now that they can see what the shows are like we are 
not getting complaints aboyut the advertising he said 
paul jones superintendent at southgate community schools in 
suburban detroit said students are used to seeing ads and pay 
little attention to those shown in school he said teachers have 
used the ads to teach lessons about marketing and sales techniques 
but the ads bother pat wright principal at carrollton high 
school 50 miles west of atlanta and an avid subscriber to the 
adfree cnn newsroom show 
i dont think you can talk to a class about iraq and kuwait 
for several minutes take a 60second commercial break and 
come back to it while keeping any consistency he said 
he said the ads also take unfair advantage of a captive 
audience of students who are required to be in school 
john kuglin who uses cnn newsroom every day with his 
fourthgrade class at cold springs school in missoula mont said 
he sees no need for a commercial news show because of the 
availability of an adfree alternative 
cnn newsroom follows a format of news stories taken from regular 
cnn reports a feature on a topic in science technology 
international events or business and a third segment devoted to a 
teenoriented feature such as career opportunities like channel 
one it make liberal use of locator maps 
cnn newsroom was launched in august 1989 making its debut after 
whittle completed the test of channel one but before channel one 
went naitonal the 15minute show runs five days a week on cnn 
louis pugliese project director of turner educational services 
said there are no precise figures on how widely the program is used 
but estimated that about 6000 schools use it regularly 
while turner offers no equipment to go with the show he said 
several cable tv system operators have taken steps to see that 
schools can receive it and some have even donated tvs for use in 
the classroom

ladies of the night who have kept the red 
lights burning at americas bestknown brothel have a new employer 
uncle sam by way of federal bankruptcy court 
the mustang ranch nevadas oldest legal bordello shut down 
tuesday after filing for bankruptcy liquidation on wednesday a 
court trustee took charge of the moneylosing business until it can 
be sold or creditors are paid off 
prostitutes who had earlier fled out of fear that tax collectors 
were about to raid the place filtered back wednesday some to pick 
up belongings and others to resume work at the 105room brothel 
i want to come back but im not going to work for no 
government said a woman who identified herself only as beth 
a lot of girls dont like the idea of working for uncle sam 
said 22yearold bree they dont like the idea of having to pay 
taxes but i know im going to give it a try if i dont like it 
ill go to the chicken ranch outside las vegas 
a lawyer for owner joe conforte said internal revenue service 
harassment killed a 5 million deal to sell the bordello and forced 
it into liquidation officials said conforte owes 13 million in 
federal taxes conforte put his debt at no more than 7 million 
the mustang was an illegal operation when conforte and his wife 
sally opened it on a 440acre ranch 10 miles east of reno in the 
1950s it became the states first legal brothel in 1971 
the bordello had been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
since 1982 meaning it operated under court supervision while it 
tried to pay off creditors two attempts to sell the business 
through stock offerings failed 
jeri coppa who previously managed smaller brothels in nevada in 
her role as bankruptcy trustee said she hopes to have the mustang 
reopened for business by the weekend she said officials from 
bankruptcy court will be on location at all times to make sure 
things run smoothly and that the government gets its due 
my whole thing is if youre running a business youre running 
a business said coppa 
plans to reopen immediately were blocked by state health rules 
which require any prostitute who leaves the premises to be retested 
for sexually transmitted diseases that can take three days 
the prostitutes must undergo monthly checkups clients must wear 
condoms 
some 45 prostitutes bartenders and floor supervisors signed up 
to resume work coppa said the irs assured her it would not harass 
the women for back taxes 
when the mustang first opened prostitution was tolerated but 
illegal in nevada it was burned down by local authorities in 1960 
as a public nuisance 
conforte won storey county approval for the brothel 11 years 
later pioneering the movement to allow prostitution in 11 of 
nevadas 18 counties 
prostitutes rented rooms at the ranch which also got half their 
earnings they accepted credit cards in advance 
conforte fled to brazil in 1981 after being convicted of tax 
evasion but returned in 1983 in a deal with prosecutors to testify 
against us district judge harry claiborne conforte claimed 
claiborne took 85000 in bribes 
after a hung jury resulted in a mistrial prosecutors dropped 
charges related to conforte ultimately claiborne was convicted of 
hiding more than 100000 in income from the irs he was later 
impeached

reportedly about 50 percent complete 
the new york times quoted unidentified wall street executives 
familiar with olympia amp yorks recent business dealings as saying a

interest in most of olympia and yorks commercial properties in the 
united states 
john zucotti president and chief executive of olympia amp york

northwest airlines heading into a tough 
earnings period sparked by the fuel crisis has received a 500 
million loan from general electric co and european aircraft maker 
airbus industrie a published report said today 
the loan agreement may have given airbus and ge an edge against 
competitors in securing a deal to sell northwest 75 new planes 
according to todays editions of the wall street journal 
northwests parent st paulbased nwa inc recently agreed to 
order the airbus a320 aircraft and take options on 30 more in a 
deal valued at 46 billion a ge joint venture is supplying is 
supplying engines for the aircraft

competing to supply the planes to northwest

northwest during negotiations over the aircraft order

the european communitys oil stocks 
have risen since early august a senior official of the 
organization said thursday 
antonio cardoso e cunha the ecs energy commissioner said 
inventories were up despite the break in oil supplies from iraq and 
kuwait 
he said the ec believed stocks must be kept for a graver 
situation warning that an unjustified signal of instability 
would be sent if the international energy agency recommended its 
members began drawing on their inventories 
cardoso e cunha said he could not put a figure on the ecs oil 
reserves but noted the 105 days of oil consumption stocks recorded 
in early august was very comfortable 
questioned on whether the ec could replace its former iraqi and 
kuwaiti crude imports with oil from the soviet union the 
commissioner said that under present technical circumstances we 
cannot replace our dependency on middle east sources he said the 
lost kuwaiti and iraqi production was being replaced by other 
middle eastern sources 
but he said energy opportunities in the soviet union were a 
key point in current trade and economic cooperation talks with 
moscow

sony corp has announced a new lineup of digital 
audio tape recorders that includes a walkmansize model saying it 
believes the technology will duplicate the success of compact 
discs 
the new equipment known as dat and cds use computerlike 
digital signals to reproduce sound but dat machines also allow 
consumers to make recordings that can rival studio equipment in 
sound quality 
the new sony dat lineup features two topoftheline machines a 
car player and a walkman weighing 14 pounds including 
rechargeable battery it will go on sale in north america and 
europe in december and january 
sony believes 1991 will be a year of takeoff for dat kozo 
ohsone senior general manager of sonys audio group said 
wednesday we see a growing market for dat linked to the growing 
importance of digital equipment 
ohsone said he believes sales of dat equipment will follow the 
pattern of cds and become widely popular in two or three years 
sony said the dat walkman to be marketed in japan for 710 is 
the first that includes all circuitry needed for recording from 
both digital sources such as cds and analog sources such as 
microphones 
its walkman for hifi maniacs a sony official said 
portable dat machines also have been announced by aiwa sharp 
hitachi and jvc 
the car player with a builtin fmam tuner will go on sale in 
japan in december for 870 sony said it uses a new technology in 
which each track on the tape is read twice by a spinning head and 
the better version selected to minimize the effect of vibration 
sony said 
all of the new machines also can play at half speed allowing up 
to four hours of playback time but at reduced sound quality 
although dat recorders were first introduced in japan three 
years ago sales have been slow because of their high cost the 
lack of prerecorded tapes and opposition from record companies 
worried that dats ability to make nearperfect copies would 
encourage record piracy 
but last year international record and electronic industry 
groups agreed on a new dat technical standard which prohibits the 
machines from being used in making secondgeneration recordings 
from cds 
equipment using the standard was first introduced this summer 
around the world including in the united states 
the response was greater than we expected and as a result we 
are introducing a full range of dat equipment ohsone said 
he said sony has sold about 30000 of its current dat model in 
the two months since then with about 70 percent of the sales in 
japan 
dat is likely to face continued sales resistance because of the 
prices which are only moderately lower than models already on the 
market 
but its chief threat in the future may be other emerging 
technologies such as recordable cds and a new digital tape system 
being developed by philips 
the technology is already developed its just a matter of 
what will sell ohsone said

under the new plan 
in may of this year we committed ourselves to maximizing 
current shareholder values through the sale of the company as a 
whole the directors said in a news release

restructuring plan provides an alternative for maximizing 
shareholder value in the near term through the taxadvantaged sale

the news sent american general stock reeling wednesday it 
tumbled 637 a share to 3362 in composite new york stock

coworkers who are based in farflung 
offices worldwide will be able to collaborate on projects using a 
new computer and software from xerox corp 
the key technology announced wednesday isnt the computer 
xerox introduced a 10000 workstation made by sun microsystems 
inc but the machines basic software called globalview 
globalview will help project teams scattered throughout 
different locations in mid to largesize companies accomplish more 
and in far less time than previously possible said joseph 
mcgrath vice president of marketing for xerox integrated systems 
operations 
globalview combines many of the basic features of an office 
computer such as software to do word processing and printing 
along with special functions to automate the tasks of groups of 
workers who collaborate on projects 
based on shared documents that combine text graphics 
spreadsheet tables and other data globalview lets a worker 
manipulate the information even when it is on a distant computer 
the changes are instantly available to the workers colleagues 
through the companys computer network 
so far few such groupware products have been brought to 
market and buyers have been reluctant to embrace the illdefined 
concept 
xerox hopes its software along with an integrated printer and 
electronic scanner it intends to unveil in the next month will 
persuade buyers they can benefit from groupware thus raising 
xeroxs low visibility in the computer industry 
what theyre trying to do here is make a broad offering of 
interest to companies with offices around the world said vera 
allensmith an industry analyst with dataquest inc a 
hightechnology h firm in san jose 
globalview is based on the companys viewpoint software which 
until now worked only on xeroxs proprietary computers it has been 
modified to run under suns version of atampts unix operating system 
on the new xerox 6520 workstation which is being manufactured for 
xerox by sun 
xerox also announced a 3995 kit that lets globalview run under 
ibms os2 operating system which is designed for personal 
computers the kit includes the software a 19inch blackandwhite 
monitor and an addin board for the ibm personal computer at and 
compatible machines 
analysts said one problem xerox may face with the software is 
that it is designed with an outofdate user interface the 
onscreen graphics and symbols through which the user controls the 
computer the user interface is similar to the one xerox invented 
in the 1970s 
other companies notably apple computer inc have made so many 
improvements to the xerox interface which includes a mouse and a 
screen partioned into windows that the xerox system is now far out 
of the mainstream analysts said

developer donald j trump has failed to make a 
11 million loan payment for the trump shuttle and is seeking to 
reschedule 245 million in loans on the airline a top aide said 
today 
the missed payment and delay request comes less than a month 
after the beleaguered real estategambling entrepreneur concluded a 
65 million bank bailout critical to keeping other elements of his 
empire afloat 
the wall street journal said trump and two aides met wednesday 
with officials from citibank asking the bank to restructure debt 
payments on the shuttle which provides service on the bostonnew 
yorkwashington corridor 
stephen bollenbach chief financial officer of the trump 
organization confirmed today that the meeting had occurred and 
said bank officials have been very encouraging so far in helping 
us through these problems 
he said trump had failed to make a 11 million payment that 
came due in the past few days he declined to say whether that 
payment would be made 
its too early to get into a discussion of terms of the 
restructuring he said in a telephone interview 
the journal story said trump was expected to make the payment 
but is not expected to be able to keep up with payments estimated 
at about 30 million due in the next 12 months 
he said citibank had prepared a memo to other banks that bought 
pieces of the loan dealing with the requested rescheduling and that 
he expected another meeting between trump officials and the banks 
would be set up for next week 
officials at citibank declined comment on the matter 
bollenbach said the primary reason for requested rescheduling 
was the depressed state of the economy in the northeast which has 
led to a sharp decline in traffic and revenue on the shuttle route 
the whole market is down he said referring to both the 
trump shuttle and its main competitor the pan am shuttle 
in addition he said the cost of fuel has more than doubled 
since early summer fuel prices have soared in the wake of iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait which raised the risk of a supply 
disruption from the region 
bollenbach said shuttle managers are operating the airline 
efficiently and that the banks were being told that the shuttle 
had become unprofitable for reasons totally outside of 
managements control 
the 245 million in loans at issue in the latest talks were not 
included in the discussions that led last month to the 65 million 
bank bailout on about 1 billion of trumps 2 billion bank debt 
bollenbach said 
the loans under discussion were part of the money trump borrowed 
to buy the shuttle from eastern airlines for 365 million in 1989
