former west german chancellor willy 
brandt said monday he hopes some of the crumbling berlin wall will 
stand permanently not as a barrier but as a reminder of the cold 
war 
a part of it should be allowed to remain standing to serve as 
something of a museum said brandt who was mayor of west berlin 
when the wall was erected in 1961 
east german officials have opened new passages through the wall 
but have made it clear they will leave much of it standing for now 
to continue marking the line between east berlin and west berlin 
brandt 75 said he was deeply moved when he visited berlin over 
the weekend and watched people freely moving through and over 
the wall 
he said he would never forget how for the first time he saw 
east german border guards smiling at east german residents as they 
passed through border control points 
they were so friendly and the east berliners who came back 
called over to the police hey look were back 
even though brandt is from the northern city of luebeck there 
are few politicians in west germany whose personal histories are so 
closely linked with the berlin wall 
he rose to world prominence in 1961 when communist east germany 
constructed the wall which became the scene of dozens of fatal 
escape attempts angered by the walls deadly threat to east 
berliners brandt immediately condemned the structure as a human 
rights violation 
in an interview shown monday night on the macneillehrer 
newshour broadcast in new york brandt was reminded of his anger in 
1961 when the three western allies america britain and france 
did nothing to tear the wall down and he was asked if president 
john f kennedy was right not to take action 
i never asked president kennedy to take military action 
brandt said what i was angry about at the time was that 
there had been so much talk about the fourpower responsibility 
the western allies and soviet union for berlin as a whole and 
when it came to a critical point we had to acknowledge that 
fourpower responsibility had to be reduced to a threeparty 
responsibility for western berlin 
i was happy that we could count on that protection 
responsibility and protection no i think looking back at it it 
was the right thing not to take the kind of military action which 
could have brought us into a new world war 
brandt said he thinks west germany should not intervene in what 
is happening in east germany but be ready to offer its help 
leave it to people in the other part of germany to find their 
proper answers to their problems but be as helpful as possible 
especially in the field of economic cooperation he said

two bluebereted french soldiers amused the crowd and shocked 
the children peering out the streaky windows of the stalled car by 
chipping away at the wall with hammers and chisels 
the big weekend shopping spree that saw 3 million east germans 
live the fantasies that tantalized them for years on western tv had 
slowed from a torrent to a steady gush but every daylight hour was 
still rush hour on the streets of west berlin

the federal government should reward not 
punish workers who blow the whistle on fraud say employees in 
telling a senate subcommittee how they were thwarted in efforts to 
expose abuse 
theres no reward for being a whistleblower complained a 
defense department worker in pittsburgh who went public with 
allegations about a western pennsylvania defense contractor 
nancy kusen said monday that the government saved 33 million 
on a contract when she brought allegations of fraud to their 
attention but all she got in return were two lines of commendation 
when someone finds a wallet they get a reward she told the 
senate governmental affairs subcommittee on general services 
federalism and the district of columbia which held a hearing into 
the inspectors general fraud hotlines 
the 16year federal employee described for the committee her 
nearly fiveyear effort to persuade the defense department to 
investigate pricing irregularities by the elliott co then a 
subsidiary of united technologies corp 
twentysix letters to the defense department hotline describing 
contract problems including some with audit reports progress 
payment records and copies of contracts produced little action 
kusen said finally she took her information to the pittsburgh 
press 
after a series of articles in the newspaper the us navy price 
fighter detachment conducted its own inquiry the detachment found 
that on an order for 26 rotor assemblies elliott co charged 
661349 for items that should have been 148589 ms kusen said 
federal employees fear retaliation for reporting waste and 
abuse said the pittsburgh worker who said she would never use the 
hotline again 
phillip t doe an employee with the bureau of land reclamation 
who blew the whistle on a land scandal said he never considered 
the inspectors general hotline 
friends said the reaction would be one of damage 
control doe told the committee 
william m diefenderfer deputy director of the office of 
management and budget and chairman of the presidents council on 
integrity and efficiency said the testimony was the most 
demoralizing thing ive heard 
but he said he did not think it is that bad and suggested 
an increase in congressional oversightof the daytoday operations 
of the inspectors general hotline 
dina rasor director of the project on military procurement 
which recently released a 52page survival guide for the 
whistleblower said one problem with the system is that 
confidential complaints to the hotline after proceeding through 
the investigative channels usually end up on the desk of the 
whistleblowers boss and it doesnt take long to find out who 
the employee is 
the other problem is that investigators rarely work with the 
whistleblower on their inquiries they go through a stack of 
documents without understanding the problem ms rasor said 
ive never known a whistleblower to be successful with the 
hotline said rasor who has spent nine years investigating the 
military 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said their study of the hotline system found that some 
telephone hotline numbers were not listed and others did not have 
an 800number like the department of housing and urban development 
overall the gao said the hotlines can be useful in receiving 
calls and complaints

l douglas wilder the first black to be 
elected governor of any state says the democratic party should 
follow his example in virginia by offering a moderate 
mainstream message in presidential elections 
in presidential elections it is time for the democratic party 
to take a plunge into the waters of americas new mainstream 
wilder told a gathering of party leaders monday 
there was a time when democrats were elected by campaigning 
against big government and high taxes he said but for too 
long we have let the other party take these issues away from us 
indeed we have allowed them to hammer us with these issues 
wilder virginias lieutenant governor spoke to the democratic 
leadership council a group of conservative and moderate democrats 
formed in 1985 to counteract liberals who have dominated the 
partys presidential nominating process 
the group has tried to steer the party toward the right and 
wilder has bickered publicly with the group and some of its leaders 
in the past 
after taking office in 1986 wilder criticized the council as 
exclusionary and divisive and he charged it was trying to weaken 
the influence of the partys basic constituency groups including 
blacks 
noting those past differences wilder said i will not look 
back we will look for forward we will be there together 
wilder said his campaign was successful because it appealed to 
mainstream values to regain the white house democrats must 
identify with the nations concerns about crime and drugs jobs 
the environment education and the desire to hold the line on 
taxes he said 
although his candidacy was closely watched by black leaders 
wilder deliberately kept liberal twotime presidential candidate 
jesse jackson at arms length and did not invite jackson to 
campaign for him 
mainstream values are the values of the overwhelming majority 
of the people of this country wilder said its time our party 
began focusing on such values at the national level 
wilder whose razorthin victory is subject to a recount 
requested by his republican opponent campaigned as a moderate in 
the tradition of his two predecessors gov gerald baliles and sen 
charles robb a former governor and president of the dlc 
wilders call on the party to embrace mainstream values as the 
key to regaining the white house used a common buzzword for the 
council robb in a morning address to the group used the word 
mainstream no fewer than 21 times and the inaugural issue of 
the groups new magazine was distributed bearing the title the 
mainstream democrat 
stand pat with liberal fundamentalism or build a new agenda 
on mainstream values that is the choice robb said 
speaking to reporters later wilder lavished praise on the 
council but stopped short of saying he would join the partys 
other top elected black house majority whip william gray of 
pennsylvania is a cochairman of the council and has urged wilder 
to join 
arkansas gov bill clinton praised wilder before the group 
saying he will change the course of american politics not 
because he is black but because of what as a black american he 
will do

despite prodding from democrats president 
bush is reacting cautiously to democratic reform in east germany 
saluting the developments as momentous and irreversible while 
trying to avoid any appearance of gloating 
it is a balancing act intended to lend support and 
encouragement to the march toward freedom while guarding against 
doing anything that might provoke a crackdown in east germany or 
slow the dramatic pace of reform 
we are handling it in a way where we are not trying to give 
anybody a hard time bush said last week he said he was 
responding in a rather measured way that was designed to 
encourage change and hopefully not contribute to an unforeseen 
disorder 
now two wellplaced us officials say bush is considering a 
meeting with nato leaders in brussels after his summit next month 
with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev the aim of such a meeting 
would be to show western unity on the future of germany and to 
discuss new political and military strategy in light of the changes 
in eastern and central europe 
bushs initial approach to the opening of east germanys borders 
was so lowkeyed that bush felt obliged to explain i am not an 
emotional kind of guy im very pleased 
questioned monday about bushs restrained reaction white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said i urge you not to mistake 
that for the personal enthusiasm for the freedom and the extension 
of values that are now going to the east german people 
an administration official discussing bushs approach said 
things are going so well in eastern europe why screw them up 
by saying something provocative we dont need to say we won 
they lost 
democrats have been attacking bush all year as too timid and 
hesitant about changes in the soviet union and across eastern 
europe and they unveiled a new volley monday 
even as the walls of the modern jericho come tumbling down we 
have a president who is inadequate to the moment said house 
democratic leader richard a gephardt 
the changes taking place in europe should galvanize our 
president into action gephardt said but at the very time 
freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations in europe 
our president is sitting politely in the audience with little to 
say and even less to contribute 
senate majority leader george mitchell urged bush to go to 
berlin to hail the figurative and literal destruction of the 
berlin wall 
he also said bush should swiftly suspend trade barriers against 
the soviet union and grant moscow observer status at international 
economic institutions 
fitzwater said it was extremely unlikely that bush would go 
to berlin 
its our feeling that there are any number of policy reasons 
why that is probably not the right thing to do at this time 
while cheering the developments in eastern europe the 
administration acknowledges it has been surprised by the pace of 
change and is uncertain where events will lead 
preparing for his summit with gorbachev on dec 2 and 3 bush 
met monday with a panel of academic and government experts on the 
soviet union the meeting focused on military developments in the 
soviet union earlier sessions were devoted to the kremlins 
economic problems 
fitzwater said the changes in eastern europe particularly in 
east germany are putting a new focus on the summit 
certainly the exodus from east germany and the taking down of 
the berlin wall in terms of peoples ability to move across the 
borders adds a new sense of urgency and a new dimension to that 
whole discussion the spokesman said 
he said bush would not be accompanied to the summit by a large 
number of arms control specialists but that the talks should 
give a push to negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear arms 
and conventional weapons 
meanwhile bush turned up the rhetorical heat on developments in 
eastern europe during an emotional ceremony monday welcoming 
solidarity leader lech walesa to the white house 
the iron curtain is fast becoming a rusted abandoned relic 
symbolizing a lost era and a failed ideology bush said 
the change is everywhere the president said poland 
hungary czechoslovakia and ladies and gentlemen the week that 
brought lech walesa to america is the week the headlines 
proclaimed and the wall comes tumbling down

democratic senators from five states that have 
federal nuclear weapons facilities want president bush to withdraw 
his nomination of victor stello jr to head weapons production 
saying hes unqualified for the sensitive post 
in a letter made public monday the senators said the poor 
condition of the nations 12state nuclear weapons complex makes it 
crucial that bush find someone of undisputed credentials for the 
job of assistant secretary for defense programs 
unfortunately based upon his record of circumventing health 
and safety regulations and obstructing investigations while at the 
nuclear regulatory commission we strongly believe that mr stello 
is not the proper candidate for this responsibility and that the 
senate should reject his confirmation the letter said 
stellos confirmation hearing is scheduled for wednesday in the 
senate armed services committee his nomination was announced july 
24 by the white house 
the letter opposing the nomination was signed by sens richard 
bryan of nevada howard metzenbaum of ohio alan cranston of 
california tim wirth of colorado and brock adams of washington 
state 
wirth is on the armed services committee the four others are 
not 
wirth is the only member of the committee to openly oppose 
stellos nomination so it is not clear how other members might 
vote 
stellos critics contend he is poorly suited to ensure health 
and safety at the nuclear weapons plants but energy department 
officials contend his broad experience in commercial nuclear power 
regulation makes him a good choice 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said the senators 
letter was not news to him because the five already had 
informed the department of their opposition to stello he said he 
knew of one or two other senate opponents but added we think 
the votes are there to gain full senate approval this month 
stello has been working as a special assistant to energy 
secretary james d watkins since july 
the weapons complex including 17 major plants and laboratories 
in 12 states is beset by mechanical safety environmental and 
management problems that watkins has said must be corrected soon to 
assure the nations nuclear defense 
stello had been chief of staff at the nuclear regulatory 
commission since 1986 ranking directly under the five commission 
members the nrc regulates commercial nuclear power 
in a move interpreted by some as a sign that watkins may doubt 
stellos chances of winning senate confirmation in the current 
session of the congress watkins late last month told one of his 
top aides to temporarily take charge of the weapons office

margaret thatcher who only six months ago looked 
unassailable is suddenly looking vulnerable and defensive 
an economic slump culminating in the oct 26 resignation of her 
treasury chief has confronted her with possibly the worst crisis 
of her decade in office 
the combative determination that wrought a revolution is looking 
more like authoritarianism a trait she may have exercised once 
too often in forcing the resignation of chancellor of the exchequer 
nigel lawson 
and for the first time she has given britons a glimpse of a 
future without her allembracing presence saying she is likely to 
step down sometime after the next election which must be held by 
mid1992 
i think people would think it was time for someone else to 
carry the torch she told the sunday correspondent newspaper 
at 64 midway through a third fiveyear term her comment 
shouldnt have been all that surprising the fact that it triggered 
a furor is testimony to the profound impact she has had on british 
life 
her supporters insist that mrs thatcher will triumph that she 
thrives on adversity as she showed in waging war for the falkland 
islands facing down northern irelands militants and most 
recently at last months commonwealth conference resisting a 
united front seeking tougher sanctions for south africa 
in a country where every other politician seems to change 
postures every opinionpoll time thatcher irritating as she 
frequently is does not do that wrote norman macrae in the 
sunday times 
says mrs thatcher a leader must lead firmly how can i 
change margaret thatcher i am what i am 
but her admission of political mortality is likely to intensify 
the war of succession that began to stir last month at her 
conservative partys annual convention 
contenders such as former defense secretary michael heseltine 
and deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe were already sending 
out veiled challenges 
with inflation above 7 percent interest rates at an eightyear 
high of 15 percent and the trade deficit hitting new records the 
gloss had gone off the thatcherite boom and the opposition labor 
party was averaging a 10point lead in opinion polls 
then came lawsons bombshell depriving mrs thatcher of the man 
she herself had credited with turning britains economic fortunes 
around thus her interview published nov 5 became something of a 
starters pistol in the race to succeed her 
lawson said he resigned because mrs thatcher ignored his 
ultimatum to sack sir alan walters her parttime economic adviser 
whom lawson accused of undermining his policies 
his resignation forced a shuffle in which the three senior 
ministries changed hands in the view of many commentators it gave 
the 22member cabinet more power over mrs thatcher if only 
because she cant afford to lose another senior minister 
the world has changed for her changed utterly the fear 
has gone out of those formerly timid men who surrounded her cabinet 
table commented the prothatcher daily express 
at the heart of the crisis are two issues mrs thatchers 
personal style and britains place in europe the political issue 
set to dominate the british political agenda in the 1990s 
the style issue is an old one mrs thatcher as the nannyprime 
minister convinced she alone is right mrs thatcher the hectoring 
bully mrs thatcher the crusading freemarketeer whose hatred of 
socialism leads her to savage everything from organized labor to 
the cherished national health service mrs thatcher the 
handbagger a term drawn from the popular caricature of an iron 
lady who slaps down critics with her handbag 
the lawson dispute was on the face of it about whether britain 
should join the currencystabilizing exchange rate mechanism of the 
european monetary system which links nine of the 12nation eecs 
currencies 
lawson who had already been trying to steady the economy by 
tying the pound to the powerful west german mark wanted to join as 
soon as possible 
mrs thatcher under pressure has agreed in principle to join 
under strict conditions but she sounds unenthusiastic and walters 
called the european monetary system a halfbaked idea 
many observers believe her attitude is symptomatic of an island 
nations persistently ambiguous attitude toward european 
integration as commentator robert mauthner put it in the 
financial times 
mrs thatchers foreign policy has swum along on her warm 
relationship with former president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev allowing her to project britain as a world power 
but president bush seems more interested in the continent than 
its islands and west germany is far better placed than britain to 
meet the economic challenge of a transformed soviet bloc 
meanwhile the thatcher eurobashing of the 1980s caricatured 
as the britainvsforeigners approach has given way to worries 
mrs thatcher will miss the boat and end up marginalized in both 
europe and washington 
two years ago she was arguably the most respected statesperson 
in the world said michael dobbs a former senior conservative 
party official yet in just a few months her simply unrestrained 
enjoyment of a good punchup has left her virtually friendless on 
the diplomatic scene 
a harris poll for the bbc in october showed 62 percent 
disapproval of mrs thatchers attitude toward britains european 
allies 
the poison is at the heart of this government in that its 
leader is unable to command the support of the best men in 
conservative politics commented hugo young a thatcher 
biographer and columnist in londons liberal guardian newspaper 
europe has shaken the government before in 1986 a battle was 
waged in the cabinet over whether to sell an ailing british 
helicopter company to an american company or a european consortium 
heseltine who favored the european option lost out and resigned 
he is now mrs thatchers likeliest successor 
europe is heading toward greater unity bringing the corporate 
mildly socialist doctrines prevalent on the continent into growing 
confrontation with the robust individualism espoused by the 
thatcherites so for british politics europe looks like a drama 
that will run and run

the chairman of a senate appropriations panel 
is warning the us customs service not to sign a contract for a 
third sophisticated radar plane until electronics problems are 
resolved in two existing aircraft that detect drugsmuggling 
flights 
im very interested being the chairman of the funding 
committee in not letting a new contract when we dont have one 
that works sen dennis deconcini said monday demanding 
corrections in the computerized electronics in the lockheed p3 
airborne early warning aircraft 
the arizona democrat who heads the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on treasury postal service and general government is 
urging that the problems be fixed by march a month before the 
customs service is scheduled to sign a contract with lockheed 
aeronautical systems co for its third flying radar platform 
they have to tell us it will be corrected by march if they 
dont fix it im going to come down on them hard deconcini 
said if they dont adhere to the suggestion ill have a hearing 
and it wont be pleasant 
customs service documents and sources show that the aircraft 
have experienced trouble pinpointing the location of targets and 
following their course and speed faulty onboard communications 
for the crew and problems with a spinning metal radar dome 
most documents were written by crewmen at the customs service 
surveillance support center in corpus christi texas where the 
agency has based the p3 aews the frontline equipment in 
detection of airborne drug smugglers 
in the house meanwhile rep glenn english dokla a member 
of the house government operations committee said he expected 
committee chairman john conyers dmich to ask the general 
accounting office to investigate problems with the p3 aew program 
peter kendig acting director of the customs service 
surveillance center has acknowledged there are a few glitches 
in the computer systems but said the aircraft works and it works 
great 
he said the two planes now flying were mainly responsible for 
detections leading to 36 arrests from jan 1 to aug 10 seizures 
of 37000 pounds of marijuana and 8300 pounds of cocaine as well 
as vessels aircraft and vehicles 
lockheeds airborne early warning program manager john 
mcginnis has said he hopes anomalous behavior in the tracker 
will be fixed by the first of the year 
the airplane and the tracker are very capable and doing their 
job despite the discrepancies mcginnis said 
the first p3 airborne early warning aircraft was delivered in 
june 1988 at a cost of more than 27 million and the second 
arrived in april at a price of 306 million the third plane will 
cost 35 million money already appropriated by congress 
the lockheed p3 is a fourengine turboprop built to detect 
enemy submarines but two airframes were outfitted with the most 
sophisticated electronics available and sold to the customs service 
to detect airborne drug smugglers 
the major electronics problem documented in customs service

a murder suspect being driven on a busy highway 
to a city jail monday pulled out a gun and fired from the back seat 
at two detectives killing them both authorities said 
the convict identified as stoney harrison 25 ran from the 
scene according to police commissioner richard condon 
around midnight about 10 hours later police brought in for 
questioning a man believed to be harrison who was found in a home 
in the borough of brooklyn said police sgt pete berry 
killed were detectives keith l williams 34 of new york city 
and richard j guerzon 46 of merrick said sgt raymond 
odonnell a police spokesman 
the shooting the first to claim the lives of two city police 
officers in more than 11 years occurred on the grand central 
parkway in the borough of queens near laguardia airport 
the detectives had driven harrison from the citys rikers island 
jail to the queens district attorneys office earlier in the day to 
take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain police said 
he was being taken back to rikers in one of the detectives 
personal cars when the shooting occurred 
condon said both officers carried pistols in ankle holsters but 
neither had been fired the weapon with which they were shot was 
not recovered and condon said it was unclear where harrison got a 
gun 
the seating of detectives and inmate them in front him alone 
in back violated procedure condon said police said it was not 
against police guidelines to transport prisoners in personal cars 
harrison was handcuffed when he was in the car but was not when 
he fled according to witnesses a pair of cuffs was found in the 
front seat 
police said it appeared the car pulled over to the side of the 
highway before shots were fired both detectives appeared to have 
been shot once in the back of the head 
police said harrison a resident of queens has an extensive 
criminal record dating to 1984 including drug and assault charges 
in 1985 he was sentenced to 364 days in jail for biting off a 
girlfriends ear 
he was arrested in july for allegedly strangling another 
girlfriend after a night of partying and drugtaking in october

against him in the july slaying he allegedly had his mother offer 
2000 to a hit man who turned out to be an undercover detective 
port authority police officer robert schaefer said three men 
were arrested near the airport shortly after mondays shooting but 
each was released 
an hour after the shooting the detectives bodies in white 
bags were on grass near the parkway the sedan they were driving 
was parked nearby there were bullet holes in the windshield and 
the wipers were on 
another car its front end smashed also sat in the road police 
capt stephen davis said the driver of the second car was not 
involved in the shooting westbound traffic on the parkway was 
limited to one lane 
officer hugh mulvey the first officer on the scene said he 
found one police officer face down on the ground and the other 
officer on the passenger seat shot and killed 
at least seven witnesses were being interviewed 
it was a pretty bloody scene schaefer said asked where the 
officers had been shot he said there was so much blood it was 
hard to tell 
the officers were members of the queens district attorneys 
detective squad schaefer said 
williams who leaves behind a wife and a daughter was appointed 
to the police department in 1981 and earned two police awards 
guerzon who had a wife and two children was appointed in 1969 and 
earned 13 awards odonnell said 
rewards totaling 40000 were offered for information leading to 
the officers killers 10000 from a group of city businessman 
called copshot 10000 from the city and 20000 from the 
detectives endowment association which represents detectives 
the last time two police officers were killed in the same 
incident was april 2 1978 officers norman cerullo and christie 
masone were killed in a gunfight with two occupants of a car they 
stopped in brooklyn 
the officers shot monday became the fourth and fifth ones killed 
in the line of duty this year fourteen others have been wounded

in what would be good news for consumers and 
business borrowers many private economists are looking for 
interest rates to continue falling over the next six to nine months 
the analysts are looking for further rate declines as the 
federal reserve tries to keep a sluggish economy from toppling into 
a recession 
but while economists are looking for future rate cuts by the 
central bank they dont expect to see any further action in that 
direction over the next month or so given the fact that fed 
policymakers moved to ease credit conditions slightly just last 
week 
those comments were the prevailing view as top fed officials 
gathered in washington today for a meeting of the federal open 
market committee the panel of fed board members and regional bank 
presidents that meets eight times a year to map monetary strategy 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said he was 
looking for a variety of consumer and business borrowing rates to 
edge lower through next summer reflecting sluggish growth during 
this period and fed easing moves 
wyss predicted that the benchmark prime rate to which onethird 
of all business and consumer loans is tied will be cut from 105 
percent to 10 percent before thanksgiving with another cut to 95 
percent in the first half of next year 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co predicted that 
the national average for fixedrate mortgages currently at a 
threemonth low of 979 percent would fall to around 95 percent 
in coming months with adjustable rate mortgages declining by a 
somewhat larger amount 
i believe we will see additional easing on the part of the fed 
over the next three to nine months because the economy will keep on 
weakening but i dont think the central bank is planning to make a 
onefourth percentage point cut in rates every few weeks sinai 
said 
analysts were still puzzling over the timing of the feds easing 
move last week members of the fomc reportedly held a telephone 
conference call nov 6 deciding to push a key interest rate the 
federal funds rate down from 875 percent to 85 percent 
manipulation of this rate which is the interest banks charge 
each other for overnight loans is the primary lever the fed uses 
to control shortterm interest rates 
private economists wondered why the fed decided to act last week 
instead of simply waiting to discuss the matter at todays 
regularly scheduled fomc meeting 
there was no need for them to panic because i dont see any 
sign that the economy is falling off a cliff wyss said 
some analysts wondered whether the fed felt pressured by the 
pointed comments being made by the bush administration that if the 
country does go into an economic nosedive next year it will be the 
fault of the central bank for keeping interest rates too high 
others suggested that the fed may have moved when it did as a 
way of reducing the governments cost of raising funds at several 
huge debt auctions held late last week after congress raised the 
debt ceiling 
but whatever the reason economists were generally optimistic 
that the feds move will succeed in keeping the current record 
peacetime expansion which is entering its eighth year this month 
going for some time to come 
many analysts believe that growth will slow significantly from 
now until next summer as the economy responds to efforts the fed 
made last year to clamp down on credit in an effort to battle 
inflationary pressures 
but starting next summer these analysts are looking for a 
rebound in growth in response to a series of credit easing moves 
the fed has made beginning last may 
the fed is trying to bring the economy from a fasttrack 
growth path to a moderategrowth path without inducing a 
recession said robert diely an economist at northern trust co 
in chicago

congress is within arms length of 
establishing a national museum of the american indian in the 
nations capital and in the process settling some longstanding 
feuds 
the senate was expected to take up a bill today to transfer a 
priceless collection of indian artifacts from new yorks museum of 
the american indian to the smithsonian institution which would 
display them in a national museum on the mall and a satellite 
facility in new york city 
the house passed the measure by voice vote monday 
a similar bill passed the senate on oct 3 but because of 
slight differences in the two bills language sen daniel k 
inouye dhawaii planned to ask the senate to approve the house 
version today said pat zell a spokeswoman for the senate select 
committee on indian affairs which inouye chairs 
the measure may at long last make peace among diverse factions 
first by resolving a 10yearold dispute in new york over how to 
display and preserve the heye foundation collection of more than 1 
million indian artifacts 
second it stipulates that the smithsonian where possible 
return some 18000 indian remains to their original tribes for 
burial 
the question of the remains had been the last obstacle to 
crafting a passable bill and compromise came in september when 
smithsonian secretary robert mccormick adams reversed the museums 
longheld policy that the bones were necessary for study 
indians nationwide seeking to bury their ancestors heralded 
his decision as a watershed that will influence other museums 
adams called mondays house action a wonderful moment 
it opens new horizons for the smithsonian and the world he 
said in a statement well be working with native american 
communities in ways weve never done before and its a model for 
working with other communities

next seasons republican 
campaigners are being advised to take firm early positions on the 
issue of abortion and run on them without hedging or compromising 
party leaders said republicans lost votes in the offyear 
elections because they equivocated on abortion not necessarily 
because they opposed it 
in addition they said democrats claimed the middle ground on 
the issue in defeating republican candidates for governor of 
virginia and new jersey a week ago 
lesson learned said lee atwater the republican national 
chairman never let your opponent define you or control the terms 
of debate 
atwater said that despite the 1989 defeats gop prospects are 
good heading into next years campaign for congress and 36 
governors 
william bennett head man in the war on drugs turned to 
politics to advise republican governors monday that hedging on 
abortion could cost the votes and doom candidates in 1990 
i believe that americans have a much higher degree of 
tolerance for honest differences deeply held differences than 
they have for trimmers and opportunists bennett told the 
republican governors association 
vice president dan quayle said republicans should take their 
positions on the basis of principle 
once you articulate that viewpoint do not start changing just 
because political winds may appear to be shifting quayle said 
that meshed with atwaters counsel candidates he said must 
decide what they believe about the issue state that position 
clearly and refuse to equivocate no matter the campaign pressures 
our party is a big tent atwater said we can house many 
views on many issues abortion is no exception 
the party platform of 1988 opposes abortion but gop leaders 
said party candidates dont need to heed it 
the republican party is not a singleissue party said 
quayle an abortion foe quayle said there are many prochoice gop 
leaders in congress and among the governors 
long term quayle said he doubts the issue will help or hurt 
either political party 
party policy and president bushs vetoenforced opposition to 
abortion align the party against the abortion rights activists who 
demonstrated in washington and elsewhere sunday 
bennett challenged them to demonstrate next time against drugs 
and the birth of cocaineaddicted babies 
i dont think that the record suggests that the prolife 
position is political suicide he said it wasnt political 
suicide for ronald reagan when he ran it wasnt political suicide 
for george bush when he ran 
we now have a situation where molly yard president of the 
national organization for women stands up and says to us if you 
dare to run people who are pro life we will get someone else up 
against you and beat your brains out bennett said how dare 
she say that 
bennett said that as long as people are marching for 
rights and freedoms and protections i would like to see a march on 
washington to protest the birth of cocaine babies 
he said people of all parties and persuasions could join that 
demonstration suggesting it should include some of the folks 
from hollywood and elsewhere who march for abortion rights 
bennett said the demonstrators claim to be concerned about the 
poor so they ought to be protesting drugs 
whatever number of people have been hurt in backalley 
abortions it is a small number compared to the number of people 
who have been hurt by backalley drug sales he said 
the governors were winding up their annual conference today with 
an education discussion featuring roger b porter bushs assistant 
for economic and domestic policy

the opening of the berlin wall showered cash on 
turkish merchants down the road from checkpoint charlie but 
berlins largest minority community still feels enclosed by 
discrimination 
the newsstands the vegetable shops the electronics stores 
had the business of a lifetime this weekend said mehmet 
elmasgunes an officer at bamukbank in west berlins predominantly 
turkish kreuzberg district 
it was an unexpected payoff he said for people who years ago 
moved into a rundown neighborhood where not every apartment had a 
toilet 
behind the wall however is a potential flood of competition 
for the lowpaid jobs once reserved for immigrants there may be 
even more demand for scarce housing an issue already turned 
against foreigners by rightwing extremists 
on the turkish side there is frustration about being barred 
from the civil service and the legal profession about the 
difficulty in becoming german citizens and the red tape that keeps 
families separated 
we have begun with taking down the worst wall the biggest 
wall and we want to work with the german people to take down these 
other walls said husnu ozankli chairman of the turkish 
community organization in berlin 
the turkish people have been here 25 years 35 years now and 
we consider ourselves part of this society 
of the 755000 workers in west berlin according to government 
statistics 47000 are turks mostly employed in factories or 
lowpaid service jobs yugoslavs who hold 15000 jobs are the 
next largest immigrant group 
these guest workers were welcomed in the 1960s but since 
1973 immigration has been restricted to spouses or children of 
workers already here 
if i married a woman in turkey today she could not come for 
at least a year ozkanli said there are so many application 
procedures that are just harassment 
in local elections in january the rightwing republican party 
blamed immigrants for berlins ills one poster accused turks of 
taking apartments needed by germans the partys share of the vote 
though only 75 percent was a green light for bigotry 
careful stinking turkish pack get out of germany you 
pigs said one note ozkanli received after the election 
it is better if you pack your suitcases now and finally get 
out of the city before it is too late 75 percent thats just 
the beginning said another 
alaaddin ozmert a turkish attache in berlin who deals with 
employment and benefit issues contended that turkish workers have 
little to fear from the opening of the wall 
the turkish workers living here are qualified skilled 
workers and they are acclimatized to the life here and to the 
market said ozmert 
the refugees from the east bloc countries are not yet familiar 
with western technology they would have to be reeducated to have 
a chance in the job market 
at bamukbank elmasgunes said he believed most east berliners 
would be content to visit and would not settle permanently in west 
germany the merchants will be happy to see them return 
even in the more subdued workaday atmosphere that settled over 
berlin on monday there was hardly room to squirm among the 
shoppers at ocak import a clerk said at least 2000 radiocassette 
players were sold over the weekend and the store hired a truck 
monday to go to west germany to replenish stocks 
we didnt think people would come here but it was like a 
carnival in the streets said mahmut balli at selcuk photo he 
held up an empty cassette tape rack to show how good business had 
been 
ozkanli emphasized that he shared in the jubilation that gripped 
the city and he offered visitors pieces he had chipped off the 
berlin wall the night before 
for now he said we dont mind stepping back a bit 
everyone has to step back added dundar atalay a math 
teacher who dropped by the office even the germans

consumer advocate ralph nader is starting a 
campaign against it but speaker thomas s foley says hes 
confident the house will approve a 33 percent pay raise and ethics 
reform package 
nader at a monday news conference said he was gearing up the 
same kind of effort that defeated a proposed 51 percent 
congressional pay raise earlier this year 
the fact that congress was offering to reform its ethics this 
time in exchange for increasing its 89500 salary and the salaries 
of federal judges and top executive officials doesnt mean the 
public should support it he said 
i dont think people in this country like the idea of congress 
telling them that they will reform themselves only if they get a 
pay increase nader said that smells bad 
members of congress are in the public service not the profit 
service if they want to make more money they can quit and go 
across the street and join a corporate law firm that will pay them 
far more than they deserve he said 
nader said he was contacting talk radio hosts and others to 
block what he said was another case of congress trying to slip one 
past the public a statement foley vehemently denied 
as usual mr nader is wrong foley said thursdays 
scheduled vote wont be coming up in the dead of night snuck 
through without a vote he said 
however foley said he wouldnt release details of the package 
until wednesday the day before the vote 
while no official version has been released the outlines of the 
plan are widely known 
it includes a 77 percent pay raise labeled cost of living 
adjustment that would take effect jan 1 a year later a 25 
percent raise would be combined with a new rule banning lawmakers 
from accepting fees for speeches 
the package also includes tighter ethics restrictions on other 
outside income including gifts and free trips 
fred wertheimer president of common cause a group that pushes 
for tighter government ethics rules praised the proposal 
it will help ensure that the nations top public officials are 
fully compensated by the public without supplements of private 
interest influence money he said monday 
it appeared monday that wertheimers scenario was only half 
right as the senate seemed pleased to keep taking the speaking 
fees 
senate majority leader george mitchell said monday that he 
didnt have the votes to pass the package in his chamber but it 
was possible the senate would allow the house to go its own way 
there is less incentive to approve the plan in the senate its 
rules allow members to supplement their salaries up to 40 percent 
with speech honoraria compared with 30 percent in the house in 
addition senators on the average have much more personal wealth 
than their house colleagues 
congressional salaries were last increased in 1987 when 
members pay was raised from 77400

a new zealander is betting that 
british columbians will pay to jump off a bridge 
john brown wants to bring bungie jumping to western canada 
and thinks hes found the ideal location the nanaimo river gorge 
on vancouver island 
in the first year of bungie jumping in queenstown new zealand 
about 17000 thrillseekers paid to leap off a bridge with a thick 
rubber cord attached to their ankle said brown a veteran of more 
than 300 such jumps 
theres been absolutely no injuries he said 
a bungie jumper leaps headfirst toward the water the cord or 
bungie slows momentum after about a 45foot freefall the momentum 
is all but stopped by the time the jumper reaches the water but 
then comes the rebound 
the bungie pulls the jumper back skyward at almost the same 
speed as the descent brown said 
the initial plunge is the big thrill but you pull about three 
gs gravityforce coming back up and you get three or four good 
bounces he said 
brown said hes working on a longterm lease of the site and 
hopes to start building a bridge for people to jump from early next 
year 
he said he expects to charge around 70 a jump

as a campaign slogan sequestration is not 
going to make it too long almost a tonguetwister it is four 
syllables of bureaucratic jargon besides as one democrat 
observed most voters probably think it is an olympic event having 
something to do with horses 
no such luck 
what it is is the government code for automatic spending cuts 
jargon masking the fact that congress and the white house havent 
managed to put together a budget that fits their own deficit rules 
president bush has delivered a simple republican translation 
that is likely to be built into the gop campaign of 1990 
congress is to blame 
bush has the better pulpit but the democrats arent about to 
plead guilty so the budget feud will become a theme of the contest 
for house and senate seats next year by which time the mess may be 
worse than it is now 
the sequester system of spending reductions has been in effect 
for just short of a month triggered by budget failure bush is 
threatening to leave it in place unless congress devises and 
delivers spending cuts of about 14 billion 
sequestration is a drastic action but neither the 
administration nor the congress must flinch from our obligation to 
keep this nations deficit moving down and ultimately to reduce the 
debt bush said in selfappraisal of his presidency so far but 
theyve already flinched the deficit hasnt been moving down 
the sequester system of spending reductions is part of a process 
of deadlines and ceilings that are supposed to rein in deficit 
spending and start trimming it the automatic cuts that now are in 
effect and become more drastic if they stay are to reduce 
spending by an estimated 161 billion although the final figure 
may turn out to be somewhat lower 
bush now says that unless congress can slice the deficit by at 
least 14 billion in a bill that still is being negotiated hell 
veto the bill and leave the automatic cuts in place we are 
prepared to manage the government under sequester he said 
the president said the bill will have to produce real reductions 
in red ink without new taxes without pushing off spending in a 
fashion that will push the deficit up in future budgets and 
without gimmicks 
he didnt define gimmicks perhaps because the original 
administration plan for deficit reduction included savings to be 
realized by pushing up the date of a 3 billion military payroll 
and dropping postal costs from the budget numbers 
but there also is an advantage for the administration in keeping 
the current cuts bush must send congress a new federal budget 
for the year beginning oct 1 1990 only two months from now with 
the automatic cuts in place at least into the winter months it 
will be easier to produce a budget meeting next years deficit 
ceiling 74 billion 
that also would strengthen his hand in opposing future tax 
increases 
bush said he still wants to work with the democrats in congress 
for a bipartisan budget settlement that will bring down the 
deficits and that politics can wait until the fall of 1990 
but budget pronouncements on both sides are taking on a 
political edge the american people know why this deficit isnt 
down bush said last tuesday they see 4 to 1 that the 
congress is to blame 
its not a new argument 
when he signed a 1981 debt ceiling bill that pushed the limit 
past 1 trillion ronald reagan said the measure can stand as a 
monument to the policies of the past which brought it about 
policies which as of today are reversed 
the government has had to triple the limit since then last 
week just before a default deadline congress passed and bush 
signed a bill increasing the debt limit to 312 trillion

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
raising the possibility that reported soviet arms deliveries to 
central america may be the most contentious issue at the 
sovietamerican summit meeting in three weeks 
baker told organization of american states foreign ministers 
monday evening that the soviet shipments to that region remain the 
biggest obstacle to a genuine superpower accommodation 
the soviet union bears a special responsibility because its 
arms and money moving through cuba and nicaragua continue to 
support violence destruction and war baker said 
in previous statements baker has said he doesnt challenge the 
soviet claim that it has ceased direct weapons shipments to central 
america as of this year 
but he has contended that soviet shipments to the region through 
third countries and deliveries by the soviet bloc have meant that 
the kremlins allies in the area continue to be wellstocked 
his remarks monday reinforced the notion that regional conflicts 
particularly in central america could produce fireworks when 
president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev hold their 
summit meeting in the mediterranean starting dec 2 
the oas meeting featuring about 25 foreign ministers was 
continuing today after a hectic opening session monday that 
included 
a sharp exchange in which panamanian foreign minister leonardo 
kam accused the united states of pursuing fascist policies 
after baker called panama an outlaw regime that should be 
spurned by selfrespecting democracies 
the introduction by costa rica of a resolution calling on all 
oas member states to withdraw their ambassadors from panama until a 
democratic process is under way there the human rights commission 
of the oas released a report monday accusing panama of widespread 
abuses 
the admission of canada amid numerous expressions of support 
as the 32nd active member of the oas 
a demonstration by several dozen oas employees outside the 
headquarters demanding higher pay the oas is undergoing a cash 
flow crisis that has resulted in numerous layoffs and declining 
employee morale 
a call by nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto for an 
oas appeal to the government of el salvador to cease immediately 
the bombing of the civilian population baker held the leftist 
rebels responsible for the outbreak of fighting over the weekend 
calling their attacks acts of terror pure and simple 
shortly before foreign ministers opened their afternoon session 
representatives of the leftist sandinista government and the 
nicaraguan contras reconvened peace talks here after two days of 
discussions last week at the united nations 
there was no report on the meeting but descoto in an 
interview with the associated press said there was minimal 
progress at the un talks because the contra delegates werent 
interested in discussing the demobilization of their forces 
central american presidents last summer called for the 
demobilization of the rebels by dec 5 both the contras and the 
bush administration regard that deadline as essentially meaningless 
because the presidents specified that the demobilization had to be 
voluntary 
descoto said the united states could speed the peace process by 
converting the humanitarian aid being received by the rebels to 
demobilization aid 
the bush administration has insisted that the rebels must 
continue to receive us food clothing shelter and medical 
supplies until after the feb 25 national elections in nicaragua 
that the administration says will give the sandinistas 
additional incentive to hold free and fair elections

a major lender in a federal housing program 
involved in recent investigations of mismanagement is suing the 
government contending it was placed on probation because of faulty 
audits 
it seems as if hud just doesnt want to deal with the fact 
that the audit findings are incorrect fred benton chairman of 
benton mortgage co said monday apparently hud was fishing for 
scapegoats 
the company filed the us district court suit monday against 
the department of housing and urban development a second suit 
seeks a court order to force hud to give final approval to two 
bentonfinanced projects whose mortgages are in limbo because of 
the allegations against the lender 
hud spokesman william glavin said the department had no comment 
on bentons lawsuits 
the first lawsuit alleges that hud unconstitutionally denied the 
knoxville tennbased lender a chance to rebut the charges in an 
audit issued early this year by the departments inspector general 
the report alleged that benton had approved inflated mortgages 
on more than a dozen projects allowing the company to collect 
higher fees and developers excessive subsidies because those 
payments are based on the mortgage amount 
benton said the auditors violated generally accepted auditing 
procedures and ignored evidence that hud had approved the rents 
cited in the report as being excessive 
the suit alleged the auditors violated their duty to report 
accurately and fairly the findings of their own investigation 
that suit also alleged that the departments mortgage review 
board could not objectively judge bentons case because it is 
headed by hud assistant secretary for housing c austin fitts who 
the company said has accepted the findings of the audit 
the board has been scheduled for weeks to meet today to discuss 
the benton audit 
the two projects involved in the second suit are the 352unit 
pebble creek apartments in arlington texas and the 312unit 
kingsley park apartments in essex md 
benton approved mortgages for those properties through huds 
coinsurance program under which private lenders are given the 
power to endorse hud insurance on roughly 80 percent of the 
mortgage amount 
hud approved the projects at several steps of the endorsement 
process but in march notified benton it was withholding final 
approval because of the audit findings 
in the suit benton said it was losing more than 30000 a month 
on the two projects because it has been unable to keep its 
commitments to the developers 
benton also alleged it was unfairly placed on probation and that 
as a result has suffered a competitive disadvantage because all of 
its hud work must be approved in advance by the department 
one lender in the coinsurance program drg funding corp has 
more than 500 million in defaulted loans benton however says it 
has never filed a claim for a default and has had its reputation 
sullied because of the political climate surrounding the hud 
investigations 
weve bent over backwards to be helpful cooperative and 
patient fred benton said in a statement we have nothing to 
hide every project we coinsured was approved by hud every step of 
the way 
justice department investigators have reviewed the audit and the 
working papers used to compile it but have declined comment on the 
investigation

the boeing co will pay more than 52 
million in fines and restitution after pleading guilty to two 
felony charges of illegally obtaining secret pentagon budget 
documents 
before accepting the plea worked out between the justice 
department and boeing us district judge ts ellis iii grilled 
lawyers for nearly an hour monday about whether the penalty is 
appropriate to what i consider to be a serious violation of the 
law 
the company pleaded guilty to felony counts of unauthorized 
conveyance of government documents the charge carries a maximum 
fine of 10000 an individual convicted of the crime could be 
sentenced up to 10 years in prison 
ellis repeatedly questioned whether individual boeing employees 
or officials were guilty of criminal wrongdoing and if the company 
had taken proper steps to ensure it would not continue to receive 
pentagon documents it was not supposed to see 
for a group of people in a company to know that it has these 
documents and takes no action is fairly arresting ellis said 
assistant us attorney randy bellows said we were not able to 
establish to our satisfaction that other individuals were 
criminally culpable and should be prosecuted for the receipt of the 
information provided by former boeing senior marketing analyst 
richard lee fowler 
fowler who worked as a civilian air force budget official 
before joining boeings washington aerospace office in 1978 is 
awaiting trial next month on 39 counts of conspiracy and 
unauthorized conveyance 
he is accused of giving boeing 107 classified pentagon documents 
between 1979 and 1985 including studies of president reagans 
strategic defense initiative more popularly known as star wars 
bellows said boeing had cooperated with the investigation since 
1986

people who switch to decaffeinated coffee to 
avoid the jitters may be unknowingly raising their cholesterol 
levels and even heightening their risk of heart disease a study 
suggests 
researchers have long suspected but never proven that caffeine 
the chemical that gives coffee its jolt was somehow involved in 
heart trouble 
the study raises the possibility that coffee without caffeine 
could be the real villain 
the research conducted at stanford university found that 
people who went from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels 
of lowdensity lipoprotein the socalled bad cholesterol an 
average of 7 percent 
its not like going out and eating cheesecake but the overall 
impact could be great considering the popularity of 
decaffeinated coffee said dr h robert superko who directed the 
research 
superko director of stanfords lipid research clinic presented 
his findings monday at the annual scientific meeting of the 
american heart association 
he said he doubts that the process of taking out caffeine 
changes the coffee so that it raises cholesterol instead he said 
the difference may result from the kinds of beans that go into 
various types of coffee 
in general he said mild arabica beans are used to make regular 
coffee while most decaffeinated brands use more strongly flavored 
robusta beans 
superko calculated that the average 7 percent increase in bad 
cholesterol in his subjects could translate into about a 12 percent 
jump in the risk of heart disease 
does coffee cause heart disease he asked i dont know 
we can only say that coffee causes cholesterol changes 
no single study can prove that something is harmful and the 
stanford findings will have to be duplicated by other researchers 
before doctors are certain they are true 
national coffee association officials were interested in 
superkos findings but unwilling to comment in detail without 
seeing the full report 
george boecklin president of the new yorkbased association 
said coffee and cholesterol have been investigated in many 
studies with conflicting results we agree with researchers that it 
is too soon to make any definite choices 
one of those who questioned the latest findings was dr charles 
hennekens head of a harvard study of aspirins role in preventing 
heart attacks he speculated that some other habit of decaf 
drinkers rather than their morning brew may be responsible for 
the higher cholesterol 
one has to question whether its something else that coffee is 
a marker for rather than coffee itself he said 
the stanford study used 188 healthy middleage coffee drinkers 
at the start the volunteers drank three to six cups a day of 
ordinary brewed coffee for two months 
then their cholesterol levels were checked and they were 
randomly assigned to one of three groups more regular coffee 
brewed decaffeinated or no coffee 
cholesterol levels remained steady in those who stayed on 
caffeinated coffee or gave up coffee entirely but bad cholesterol 
levels rose nine milligrams per deciliter or 7 percent in the 
decaf drinkers 
superko cautioned that the study doesnt entirely exonerate 
ordinary coffee because it could contribute to heart disease in 
other ways such as by triggering rhythm abnormalities or spasms in 
heart arteries 
im not saying everyone should stop drinking decaf he said 
but if people are worried they might experiment on themselves by 
having their cholesterol levels checked 
in other findings at the meeting 
researchers at brigham and womens hospital in boston said they 
monitored the hearts of people with coronary artery disease while 
they slept and found getting out of bed in the middle of the night 
seemed to lead to potentially harmful periods of ischemia a 
temporary shortage of blood 
researchers at the medical college of wisconsin found that for 
active physically fit people with heart disease shoveling snow 
probably isnt any riskier than other moderate exercise they 
cautioned that people with heart trouble should not shovel unless 
they have taken a treadmill test and consulted their doctor

a jungleshrouded city of pyramids and 
temples in guatemala was built as long ago as 630 bc showing 
that mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than 
believed scientists say 
the findings may make the ancient city of nakbe in northern 
guatemala one of the oldest in the americas researchers said 
its a very significant discovery said arthur demarest 
anthropology chairman at vanderbilt university in tennessee 
the university of california los angeles on monday announced 
the findings by archaeologist richard hansen and colleagues at 
ucla utahs brigham young university and guatemalas university of 
san carlos 
we have substantial evidence that this is the earliest maya 
urban center ever found hansen said 
byu anthropology chairman donald forsyth added were now 
going to have to push the beginning of maya civilization back 
further into the past 
archaeologists once believed advanced mayan civilization emerged 
around ad 300 and ended 600 years later during what is described 
as the classic period research conducted during 197883 at el 
mirador guatemala pushed that date back to 200 bc 
but in excavating nakbe 350 miles north of guatemala city and 
not far from el mirador hansens 50member team determined that 
roughly 100 stone pyramids and other buildings were from about 630 
bc to 400 bc so were some of the sites 65000 pottery pieces 
sculptures figurines and other artifacts 
dates can be determined by the radioactivity of carbon in 
organic material associated with buildings pottery is dated by 
comparison with the style of shards from elsewhere in central 
america 
we have from 1000 bc to 600 bc a small village with wooden 
buildings hansen said by telephone from his home in rupert 
idaho then all of a sudden boom they brought in rock and fill 
and buried the village and made platforms on those they placed 
their buildings 
hansen said nakbes buildings include 35 to 150foottall 
platforms and flattopped pyramids many of which are topped by 
three small temples and sculpture depicting important gods and 
kings the buildings are solid without interior rooms 
the scale of construction reflects the emergence of an 
administrative and religious elite to command thousands of workers 
hansen said 
anthropologist john graham of the university of california 
berkeley said an even earlier center of advanced mayan 
civilization may be found 
still graham said the nabke study is part of the most 
exciting maya discovery of recent decades 
the discovery solves a puzzle for archaeologists the mayans 
seemed to evolve more slowly from farming communities to cities 
than other precolumbian civilizations to the north and south but 
archaeologists say nakbe proves that mayan development occurred 
more or less in step with the rise of the olmec culture in mexico 
thought to be the oldest civilization of the americas 
an archaeologist mapped some of nakbes architecture in 1962 
hansen first visited in 1987 and his team conducted the first 
fullscale excavation last february through april 
hansens team hacked their way through dense jungle for three 
days and 40 miles to reach nakbe from the nearest road they hauled 
water from a swamp 4 miles away demarest admiringly called it 
macho archaeology 
among the most important finds at nakbe is a sculpture on a 
limestone slab that probably dates from about 400 bc and is about 
10 feet tall 4 feet wide and 18 inches thick 
the sculpture of two royal figures and a god is the earliest 
and largest preclassic sculpture ever found hansen said 
other discoveries include seashells and obsidian glass tools 
that indicate emergence of longdistance trade there also are 
signs of a society taming its environment gutterlike water 
collection systems on six buildings and 60footwide stoneandmud 
roads hansen said 
he said he believes transformation from village to city happened 
because trade and the need for water and transportation fostered 
emergence of an administrative and religious elite which then 
ordered construction of temples

richard strauss die frau ohne schatten was 
one of the metropolitan operas first productions after it moved to 
lincoln center it still is one of its most magical and beautiful 
the met performed die frau on monday night for the first 
time since the 198182 season 
mechthild gessendorf was to have sung the empress but was 
replaced in the title role by soprano ruth falcon because of 
illness 
for miss falcon of new orleans the performance was her met 
debut 
the part contains very high notes which miss falcon can reach 
however her vocal production was inconsistent when she was good 
she sounded very good but that wasnt all the time 
the evenings star was marilyn zschau of chicago 
die frau ohne schatten the woman without a shadow is 
about an empress who cannot bear children 
she lived in a spirit world before she married the emperor in 
that world she and her nurse meet the dyer and his wife theyre 
looking for an ordinary woman to relinquish her shadow so the 
empress can take it 
the dyers wife toys with ideas of glittery clothes and a young 
man both are conjured up by the nurse that might be more fun 
than motherhood miss zschau who performed the dyers wife was 
fairly flamboyant in acting and singing her voice pours out 
radiantly beautiful large and exciting 
robert schunks tenor was less than subtle as the emperor 
conductor christof perick seemed to increase volume every time 
schunk sang and the tempo of schunks first aria was so slow he 
seemed to have trouble baritone bernd weikl fared better as the 
dyer sounding serious and solid but warm 
helga dernesch as the nurse was having pitch problems 
nathaniel merrill oversaw the production which uses a shiny 
dark green forest for the royal and spirit scenes a gazebo is as 
delicate as a fairytale 
the stage machinery is used for scene changes projections merge 
into new ones sets go up or down bringing a new scene to stage 
level as the old disappears and the turntable revolves 
this is an opera that ends happily librettist hugo von 
hofmannsthal presents fulfilled family life with both couples 
embracing both women possessing shadows

which measured 71 on the richter scale killed 66 people and did 
an estimated 7 billion in damage 
i am extremely impressed with the way this was handled

western hemispheres poorest and most polarized countries 
with an estimated 7000 regular fighters and perhaps twice as 
many irregulars the leftist rebels know they cannot defeat a 
45000man armed force backed by massive us aid 
instead they hope to bring about broad social and political 
change by either making the country so chaotic that the status quo 
crumbles or by pressuring the new rightist government into 
concessions 
in the eyes of rebel theoreticians el salvador could become 
ungovernable if a broadbased civilian movement encouraged by the 
organizational efforts of the rebels or political activists who 
share some of their goals meshes with the armed rebel struggle 
this insurrection isnt conceived of as a general uprising in 
which the masses will rise up throughout the country at the same 
time rebel commander leo cabral said recently we have a more 
irregular much less classic concept 
they see pressure from inside and outside el salvador as the key 
to forcing the government to meet their negotiating terms 
the military struggle is a means of backing up demands 
rebel commander joaquin villalobos said in an interview in managua 
nicaragua last week 
whether the spectacular and bloody offensive they launched 
saturday night will move them any closer to their goals remained to 
be seen but the rebels clearly put the war back in the spotlight 
the only good thing that could result from this would be to 
wake people up to bring about negotiations said lutheran bishop 
medardo gomez a member of a nationwide coalition seeking peace 
talks otherwise we are lost 
both us and salvadoran officials insist the offensive is an 
attempt to disguise declining rebel military fortunes 
i think this is a sign of weakness rather than strength 
us ambassador william walker told reporters late monday 
he said the offensive would not reverse what he called the 
fading fortunes and legitimacy of the rebel front 
but walker also called it part of an attempt by the front to 
enhance its appearance of strength at the bargaining table 
the guerrillas stunned the nation by bringing their fight to the 
capital as they had never done in 10 years of largely rural 
hitandrun combat 
after nearly 24 hours of heavy combat the rebels had entrenched 
themselves in neighborhoods along a wide arc on the northern fringe 
of san salvador 
they installed themselves in homes and apartments and positioned 
snipers in church towers and tall buildings in many areas 
civilians both willing and unwilling were obliged to provide 
support 
walker said an estimated 1500 guerrillas were taking part in 
the fighting in the capital the attacks in san salvador were 
accompanied by at least 50 other coordinated actions nationwide he 
said 
civilian casualties appeared high as government helicopter 
gunships strafed heavily populated areas where the rebels were dug 
in 
some feared the offensive would move the government away not 
toward negotiations by strengthening the hand of the 
ultrarightists in president alfredo cristianis nationalist 
republican alliance who have long been accused of links to death 
squads 
this will be a test for the government because it has facist 
tendencies gomez said as gunfire crackled outside his modest 
church in the city center 
cristiani imposed a state of seige after the fighting broke out 
suspending constitutional rights such as freedom of assembly and 
his government imposed a virtual news blackout the president also 
warned that political parties that might be part of the fmln 
would not be tolerated 
recently initiated peace talks between the rebels and the 
government broke down after the oct 31 bombing of the headquarters 
of a union sympathetic to the rebel cause in which 10 people were 
killed and 29 were injured 
the rebels who named the offensive after one of the slain union 
leaders clearly hoped public indignation over the bombing combined 
with the shock of the fierce combat in the capital would help 
revive the peace process 
the two sides are far apart and each accuses the other of 
lacking any real interest in peace 
the rebels say cristianis demand that the fighting stop before 
any serious talk on reform begins is like an invitation to suicide 
cristiani says rebel demands for a purge of the military high 
command and for replacing the supreme court are totally absurd 
we realize that the fmln is a reality that it exists he 
said recently but it is a small reality

at night the crackinfested innercity 
neighborhood where a motorist was shot to death in front of her 
4yearold son is full of suburban commuters who cruise in to 
buy drugs then motor home 
neighbors of the north harlem neighborhood call it drug 
city and describe a life in which gunfire is common and drug 
dealers so brazen they can grant or withhold permission for a 
person to enter his own apartment building 
residents see the fancy cars arrive from the new jersey and 
connecticut suburbs drawn by the streetside trade in cocaine 
heroin and other drugs in a neighborhood of boardedup buildings 
and crumbling sidewalks a mural that reads push crack back is 
just wishful thinking they say 
janet pierro 33 of weehawken nj and her son arrived in the 
neighborhood in a rented car shortly before dawn sunday police 
said 
a man approached the car and fired one shot into the rear 
striking mrs pierro in the back she drove about a block before 
striking a light pole said officer hugh barry 
mrs pierro died at harlem hospital her son was unharmed 
police later arrested myron morton 32 and charged him with 
seconddegree murder and criminal possession of a deadly weapon 
mrs pierro lived with her husband robert their son and 
8monthold daughter in a twostory house pierro a furniture 
store manager said he didnt know why his wife was in harlem 
she was a typical middleclass housewife said jerry thomas 
who lives near the family 
she dressed very conservatively and loved her kids she was 
helpful to neighbors once she helped jump my car battery i 
cant believe the slaying 
the motive appeared to be robbery police said monday but added 
that it was unclear if mrs pierro had been in the area to buy 
drugs or had accidentally wandered into streets overrun by drug 
dealers 
either way the shooting has drawn attention to the concern by 
law enforcement officials and others about suburban drug buyers 
statistics from the citys tactical narcotics team document the 
suburban drug trade of 3000 cars seized from accused drug buyers 
between 1986 and november 1600 were from outside the city 600 
from new jersey alone 
we see some really terrific cars said inspector alfred 
james of the narcotics team 
robert stutman special agent in charge of the federal drug 
enforcement administration in new york said suburbanites who shop 
for drugs in the inner city are contributing significantly to the 
drug problem in america 
we still see people coming in from the suburbs into heavy drug 
areas to purchase drugs and take them out to the nice suburbs 
stutman said they are doing business with people prone to 
violence occasionally they get them upset 
in a june drug raid 10 blocks from the scene of sundays 
killing police confiscated 42 cars including 25 from new jersey 
and 13 from other new york suburbs 
suburban residents have been caught up in the violence before 
in april 32yearold lidia ferraro of fairview nj was shot 
and killed by police officers after she led them on a chase through 
east harlem streets police said they pursued her after she ran a 
red light while high on heroin cocaine and other drugs 
new jersey authorities are well aware of the problem prosecutor 
john holl said his bergen county office in july began identifying 
motorists buying drugs across the george washington bridge in 
manhattan and arresting them when they returned to new jersey 
crack is cheaper over there than it is here holl said 
a harlem resident who lives near where the pierro slaying 
occurred said she hoped it would draw attention to her block and 
help save it 
i hate that the poor woman got killed but i hope they can do 
something about it please come help us out here in hamilton place 
we need it the woman said she asked not to be identified for 
fear of reprisal from drug dealers

the galileo spacecraft speeding toward 
a 1995 rendezvous with jupiter successfully completed its first 
course correction by firing its small thrusters more than 2000 
times nasa said 
the threeday maneuver which ended saturday night accelerated 
the spacecraft by about 38 mph bringing its speed to more than 
60000 mph relative to the sun said jim wilson spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the trajectory change is meant to put galileo in proper position 
for its flight past venus on feb 9 1990 the spacecraft will 
swoop by venus once and earth twice so the planets can act as 
gravity slingshots to propel galileo toward jupiter during the 
19 billion mission 
in july 1995 galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe 
the orbiter will circle jupiter for 22 months starting dec 7 
1995 and the probe will parachute into the jovian atmosphere 
making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense 
pressure 
galileo was launched from space shuttle atlantis on oct 18 on 
monday galileo was 53 million miles from earth and 369 million 
miles along its looping 24billionmile path to jupiter 
wilson said several of galileos 12 thrusters fired a total of 
2000 brief pulses during the trajectory maneuver the first of 
about 30 course corrections needed to get the spacecraft to 
jupiter the solar systems largest planet 
a temperature sensor on one thruster malfunctioned friday so 
another thruster was used saturday mission director neal ausman

the former president of the beechnut nutrition 
corp admitted he cheated millions of consumers by selling them 
sugar water labeled as pure apple juice for babies 
niels l hoyvald 56 pleaded guilty monday to 10 felony counts 
of violating the federal food drug and cosmetic act the plea 
forestalled a third trial for hoyvald 
i did not intend to defraud but i do plead guilty with intent 
to mislead the public hoyvald said i did it knowingly 
were glad this defendant has finally admitted his 
involvement said the prosecutor assistant us attorney thomas 
h roche 
beechnut and its corporate parent spent as much as 10 million 
in legal fees during the case said federal judge thomas c platt 
platt fined hoyvald 100000 and sentenced him to five years 
probation and six consecutive months of fulltime community 
service the agreement concludes a complex and costly prosecution 
that began three years ago 
hoyvald was convicted in february 1988 on about 350 counts of 
willfully violating the food and drug act but a federal appeals 
panel overturned the conviction on a technicality a second trial 
in september ended with a mistrial 
hoyvald who has since been fired by beechnut was president of 
the company during part of the period that the babyfood giant 
produced and distributed as pure apple juice for babies what was 
actually water flavored with beet sugar or other sweeteners and 
containing little if any apple 
this case has probably cost nestle the corporate parent of 
beechnut in fines and legal fees many times the few millions 
they saved in passing off this bogus apple juice to the public 
said andrew j maloney us attorney for the eastern district of 
new york 
in november 1987 beechnut pleaded guilty to 215 felony counts 
and paid a 2 million fine plus investigation costs 
another defendant john f lavery a beechnut vice president 
during the years the company willfully cheated millions of its 
customers was also convicted in the scheme 
the us supreme court last month ended laverys right to appeal 
and obligated him to serve a yearandaday jail sentence

the military wants more land for war games 
in four western states but hunters ranchers and environmentalists 
see its plans as a land grab twice the size of massachusetts that 
menaces wildlife and farming 
four separate proposals by different branches of the armed 
services would expand areas for training with tanks warplanes and 
artillery by 16800 square miles in unconnected areas in montana 
idaho utah and nevada 
the pentagon says the proposals to add military training to uses 
allowed on the federally owned land arent part of a coordinated 
effort but environmentalists say congress rejected a similar 
national program in 1974 
its too coincidental to be a coincidence said charles 
griffith regional executive for the national wildlife federation 
in bozeman 
the national guard wants to use 1500 square miles in 
northeastern montanas rolling plains for training by its own units 
and forces of the north atlantic treaty organization about 
threefourths of the acreage is federally owned grazing land 
in southern idaho the air force has proposed expanding the 
155squaremile saylor creek bombing range to more than 2300 
square miles the plan has stirred opposition from ranchers with 
cattle grazing the land environmentalists fearing damage to 
wildlife and some local politicians 
in utah the air force wants to create a 3 billion electronic 
battlefield that will be used to test aircraft and weapons under 
simulated combat conditions the machinery would be scattered 
across a 20milewide 70milelong section of the states western 
desert 
in western nevada the national guard wants a 1100 square mile 
training area near naval air station fallon 
the base also has proposed adding 10000 square miles of the 
airspace used for flight training more than doubling the area now 
used that would restrict uses of the land beneath the flight paths 
the navy also wants to set aside 310 square miles in nevada as a 
missile firing range plus 280 square miles as buffer zones for the 
naval air stations bombing ranges 
despite the suspicions of environmentalists the simultaneous 
proposals in four states are coincidental said maj everett 
foster public affairs officer for the national guard bureau at the 
pentagon 
i have not been aware of anything that would tie this to those 
other issues he said he said the montana proposal was tailored 
to the montana guards needs as it converts to f16 fighter planes 
newer tanks and updated cobra helicopter gunships 
the nevada guard has undergone a similar shift to different 
aircraft and equipment he added 
the military needs more sites for its maneuvers in sparsely 
settled areas of the west because many of the nations existing 
bases are getting hemmed in as cities and suburbs spread foster 
said 
the plans are raising eyebrows in all four states where the 
military already controls a combined 5300 square miles 
ranchers say theyre worried about the effect on federal grazing 
land which is leased to cattlemen farmers say theyre worried 
about water rights hunters question the effect of military 
training on wildlife 
in montana a sixweekend trial run on a small section did 
little to reassure ranchers who use the land to graze cattle 
i dont know how the hell were going to get something to grow 
back in that rancher peter nyquist said looking at tank tracks 
torn through the thin soil 
i dont think any of the federal or state agencies even the 
national guard itself really knows what the cumulative impacts of 
this program may be said griffith of the wildlife federation 
the military has tried to offer assurances in montana the 
guard said it wants to be just one of many users of federal land 
in compliance with the federal doctrine of multiple use of the 
federal estate 
in utah air force officials offered assurances that grazing and 
hunting on the land would continue diluting opposition from 
ranchers and residents of small nearby communities 
debate over the nevada proposals centers on a wilderness bill in 
congress that its sponsor has agreed to amend so it wont endanger 
the navys plans environmentalists have complained that the 
changes gut the legislation 
citizen alert an environmental group based in reno claims many 
of the proposed bombing and gunnery ranges are part of a regional 
continental operation range conceived by the air force but 
rejected by congress in 1974

the city agreed to pay a total of 50000 to 
more than 330 black men who were stopped frisked questioned or 
arrested last winter during a police hunt for a rapist 
the settlement came in a federal lawsuit that claimed the 
investigation was conducted in an unconstitutional manner from 
february to march 23 1988 when police arrested reynard gregory 
later convicted of 10 attacks against women 
after weeks of negotiations the agreement was reached between 
the city solicitors office and stefan presser legal director of 
the american civil liberties union and david rudovsky 
representing some of the plaintiffs 
the city admitted no liability in the case the agreement marks 
the third time since 1986 that the city has reached settlements in 
classaction lawsuits alleging constitutional violations in 
investigations by city police 
the settlement was the second in the case shortly after the 
suit was filed in us district court in march 1988 the police 
department agreed to stop detaining black men merely because they 
resembled a police sketch 
in the settlement which includes 20000 payment for legal 
fees 63 men will receive a minimum of 500 each while 273 others 
will receive at least 100 each presser said 
gregory known as the center city stalker was convicted 
last year of 10 robberies three attempted rapes and seven indecent 
assaults in a series of crimes that terrorized women living or 
working downtown 
the stalker haunted hallways and stairwells in buildings within 
a sixblock radius of city hall sometimes using ruses sometimes 
by force he would get the young wonmen he victimized into 
outoftheway locations and then rob them and sexually assault 
them 
in november 1986 the city agreed to pay nearly 500000 to be 
divided among 1444 people who were stopped or searched by police 
during a drug crackdown in 1985 
in february 1986 a 45000 settlement was reached by the city 
and residents of a neighborhood who were rounded up and questioned 
after the shooting death of a police officer

prince franz josef ii of 
liechtenstein head of state of the tiny principality during a half 
century that saw it become one of the worlds richest nations has 
died at age 83 the government said today 
he was the worlds longestreigning monarch when he died late 
monday after a long undisclosed illness and less than a month 
after his wife princess gina died at age 67 
the princes poor condition had prevented him from attending her 
funeral 
franz josef ii was the 12th ruler of the 270yearold nation 
last remnant of the holy roman empire the principality covers 
61 square miles of rolling land and rugged mountains between 
switzerland and austria 
his 51 years as head of state spanned the rise of this tiny 
democratic state from an underdeveloped and rural country to a 
sophisticated industrialized nation with one of the worlds highest 
percapita incomes 
he enjoyed great popularity among the 28000 inhabitants often 
mixing with them in the streets of vaduz the capital 
i am ruling over a happy country the prince defined by the 
constitution as hallowed and sacrosanct once said in a rare 
interview it is a happy country because it is small 
in 1984 he handed over his executive powers to his son hans 
adam the oldest of their five children but he retained the 
ceremonial role of head of state and continued to meet many 
wellwishers every year during the festivities marking his birthday 
on aug 16 a public holiday 
the constitution gave him the right to veto any piece of 
legislation but throughout his reign he used the veto only once 
to kill a law on hunting rights 
it was a silly law it would have turned every garden into a 
shooting ground he explained 
born in 1906 at frauenthal castle austria he took office in 
1938 succeeding his uncle prince franz 
franz josef took over a country that was so poor that the 
government once tried in vain to mortgage the governmentcumprison 
building his father had once sold part of the family jewels to 
bail the government out 
the young prince a nephew of austrian archduke franz ferdinand 
whose assassination in sarajevo triggered world war i faced his 
first challenge in 1938 after austria became part of the nazi reich 
he made history when he used his powers to force the formation 
of a national coalition government after the anschluss and 
paid an official visit to hitler in march 1939 
the visit helped make the nazis leave us alone because it 
flattered hitlers ego he reminisced in an interview 
he added that the fuhrer who was visibly ill at ease did 
not make any impression at all on him during the 90 minutes of 
small talk in the berlin reich chancellory like neighboring 
switzerland liechtenstein stayed neutral during world war ii 
after the war franz josef led the country in resisting soviet 
demands to extradite some 500 russians including grand duke 
vladimir cyrillovich heir to the throne of all the russias who 
had sought shelter in liechtenstein 
british historian hugh trevorroper said that liechtenstein thus 
was the only country which refused to join in what he called one of 
the great betrayals franz josef spoke of a proud chapter 
in his countrys history 
he lost extensive property in czechoslovakia when it was 
nationalized after the communist takeover of the country 
but the familys art collection of 1400 rubens van dyck and 
other old master paintings with a current estimated value of 150 
million was saved by being moved from austria to liechtenstein in 
1944 
despite his personal wealth franz josef stuck to a simple 
lifestyle that helped keep his name out of the gossip columns of 
the international press 
he was a devout roman catholic who started every day by 
attending mass in the chapel at his 13th century castle perched 360 
feet above vaduz 
while opposing any liberalization of the countrys abortion 
laws he was an outspoken champion of womens rights and began 
pressing for female suffrage in the 1950s this was grudgingly 
accepted by liechtensteins men in a 1984 referendum 
he was a keen sportsman who served for more than 35 years on the 
international olympic committee and even late in life enjoyed 
downhill skiing each winter

a federal judge set may 15 for the third 
trial of former fbi agent richard w miller accused of selling 
documents to a soviet agent 
miller was arrested in 1984 on espionage charges and remained in 
custody until his release on bond last month 
us district court judge robert m takasugi who set the trial 
date monday took over the case from us district court judge 
david v kenyon who withdrew after overseeing the first two trials 
a jury deadlocked in the first trial 
miller was convicted in the second trial and sentenced to two 
life terms plus 50 years in federal prison an appeals court 
overturned the conviction saying kenyon improperly allowed 
polygraph tests to be admitted as evidence 
a soviet emigre svetlana ogorodnikov and her husband nikolay 
entered guilty pleas in the case and are serving sentences in 
federal prison 
defense attorneys argue miller was attempting to revive his 
flagging career with a misguided attempt to infiltrate the soviet 
espionage agency the kgb

nynex corp said it had reached a tentative 
accord with two unions to end the last of the strikes that began in 
august against regional telephone companies around the country 
the company said monday that the communications workers of 
america and the international brotherhood of electrical workers had 
agreed to end the walkout that disrupted installation repair and 
directory assistance services to 105 million customers in new york 
state and new england 
however cwa spokesman steve rosenthal insisted his unions 
leaders had yet to approve the deal which hinged on settlement of 
a dispute over health care costs the cwa negotiating committee was 
scheduled to resume considering the accord today he said 
how the company wants to paint it is their business we think 
the statement was premature rosenthal said 
the tentative threeyear pact would raise wages 3 percent in the 
first year and 15 percent in each succeeding year said nynex 
spokesman tony pappas 
it was the cwas president morton bahr who first let slip in a 
washington dc speech monday that the two sides had resolved the 
contentious issue of health insurance the primary dispute was over 
nynex efforts to shift some costs presently borne by the company 
onto workers 
we have saved our health care bahr told an aflcio 
convention there are no premiums 
robert silva a spokesman for the ibew in boston said the talks 
progressed quickly after phone company officials agreed to continue 
paying all health benefits 
we look at it as a total victory silva said 
about 60000 workers in the two unions have been on strike for 
100 days at nynex subsidiaries new york telephone and new england 
telephone which serve new york connecticut rhode island 
massachusetts new hampshire vermont and maine cwa represents 
40000 new york workers and ibew has 20000 workers in new england 
the bitter dispute in which one striker died after being struck 
by a car on a picket line and the company reported numerous 
incidents of vandalism began aug 6 at that time 200000 workers 
struck four regional baby bell companies in 20 states 
including nynex ameritech in the midwest pacific telesis in the 
west and bell atlantic in the west 
the other walkouts ended within weeks nynex was said to have 
more to lose because its systems are in aging eastern cities where 
operating costs are higher 
the company said the tentative pact was reached after it agreed 
to pay all workers health benefits and the unions agreed to give 
up a bonus and profitsharing plan that would have given them an 
annual bonus of 1 percent of their annual pay 
nynex chairman william c ferguson called the tentative accord 
a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issues facing not 
only our company but the entire nation 
nynex blamed the strike for a 148 percent decline in 
thirdquarter profits

a man arrested in the 1960 death of his former 
girlfriend plans to plead guilty hoping the judge will realize he 
has changed in the interim and that not a day has gone by in 
which he hasnt been torn by remorse 
robert lee mitchell 64 of chicago told reporters upon arrival 
at dallasfort worth international airport on monday that he hopes 
the judge will show him mercy 
it was an accident we were tussling over the gun and it went 
off mitchell said 
it happened and im sorry about it he said not a day has 
gone by since then that i didnt think about what happened 
but i have changed my outlook has changed he said i 
know about the things that mean something to a human being the 
real things in life like god a family and treating your fellow 
human being right doing the best you can 
mitchell is accused of killing billie marie redmon phillips in 
september 1960 he moved to chicago where he has lived and raised 
as a family as billy jackson 
mitchell told authorities he took the name billy intentionally 
she always meant a lot to me we were together for 12 years 
he said 
mitchell was jailed in the lew sterrett justice center today in 
lieu of 100000 bail on a murder charge 
prosecutors asked for the high bond because of mitchells 
history 
hes shown hes pretty good at disappearing said norm 
kinne first assistant district attorney 
dallas county deputies were searching through some old arrest 
warrants when they found the one for mitchell a check of fbi 
fingerprint files showed that jackson had the same prints as 
mitchell 
kinne had said earlier he might have mitchell indicted under the 
habitual criminal law a move that would make a life sentence 
possible 
we still havent decided for certain kinne said but we 
probably wont reindict him he hasnt been in too much trouble 
for the last 28 years 
while living in chicago mitchell married worked 17 years at a 
steel mill and raised five children he has three grandchildren and 
worked with others on his block to fight drug dealers 
mitchell said that no one including his wife knew about his 
past until he was arrested earlier this month by the fbi 
i thought about turning myself in two or three times but then 
i thought about the pain it would cause my family so for that 
reason i didnt he said i just had to live with this 
i always did figure they would catch me he said i wasnt 
running i lived in just one place to tell you the truth im glad 
its over 
mitchell who has not hired a lawyer and did not fight 
extradition to texas says he wants to plead guilty and take the 
consequences he then would like to return to chicago 
thats who i am now he said robert mitchell is a 
different person i want to block that out of my mind completely 
when this is over with i want to get it over with and go back to 
being billy jackson

in another navy mishap two 
military planes strayed outside a target range and bombed public 
land slightly injuring a camper and forcing others to dive for 
cover 
camper bob koch of hacienda heights was hurt when struck on the 
chest either by shrapnel or debris during the saturday afternoon 
incident about two miles outside the navys chocolate mountains 
bombing range 
ill tell you koch said it was the most frightening 
experience ive ever had 
john blachley chief ranger of the federal bureau of land 
managements palm springs office said he was informed that campers 
were well within the killing zone of the bombs but may have 
been saved because they were behind the paths of the bombs rather 
than in front of them

east germanys punching of holes in 
the berlin wall has stirred hope that the barbed wire and 
fortifications dividing the korean peninsula will eventually 
disappear 
awed and stunned south koreans have watched television footage 
of portions of the wall being torn down and east germans streaming 
freely to the west 
newspapers and television stations have given exhaustive 
coverage of the demise of the wall along with a flood of editorials 
and articles asking if the same thing could happen in korea 
but few observers believe there is any chance of a quick end to 
the bitter confrontation between capitalist south korean and the 
communist north nor say observers is there much chance of any 
swift opening of the korean border 
the korean peninsula as a whole falls ever farther behind as 
the rest of the world moves on to a new postcold war mentality 
said edward poitras a noted expert on korean affairs 
yang sungchul a political analyst said the demilitarized zone 
dividing the two koreas is now the last remaining cold war 
emblem and is not likely to disappear soon 
most north koreans probably have not even been told about the 
fall of the berlin wall or other reforms in east bloc countries 
observers said 
even as the united states the soviet union and their european 
allies and satellites move to reduce tension and scale back 
military forces north and south korea are locked in a major 
military build up 
both koreas are spending billions of dollars to expand and 
strengthen their armed forces north korea with a population of 
about 22 million people is estimated to have the worlds fifth 
largest army with 125 million men 
the korean peninsula is the site of one of the worlds greatest 
military concentrations with 15 million heavilyarmed troops on 
both sides facing each other along the 100mile dmz where border 
clashes are common 
the north was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a south korean 
airliner which claimed the lives of 115 people aboard and other 
recent terrorist attacks 
the two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty 
was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 after the north 
invaded the south the border is sealed tight with virtually no 
contact and both sides claiming to be the one legitimate government 
of all korea 
the koreans fought a war and the germans did not theres a 
lot of suspicion that still exists said billy fullerton a us 
army analyst 
some 43000 us troops are based in south korea under a mutual 
defense treaty us and south korean leaders say the american 
forces are vital to prevent another korean war despite some us 
congressional calls for a reduction to save money 
north korea remains a rigid totalitarian regime under the 
godlike rule of kim il sung who has dominated the country with a 
vast personality cult since the late 1940s the 77yearold kim has 
designated his son kim jung il as his political heir in what 
would be worlds first communist dynasty 
while the soviet union china and other communist nations have 
undergone reform in recent years north korea has made no attempt 
to move away from its oppressive political system even though its 
economy has virtually collapsed 
most south korean and us observers say there is virtually no 
chance of political change in north korea while kim il sung remains 
in control they say his son appears determined to continue the 
system 
for north korea to emulate sovietstyle reform some observers 
say would have been like stalin ordering the dismantling of the 
iron curtain in 1950 
alarmed by the wave of liberalization in other communist 
nations kim il sung who rarely leaves his country visited 
beijing earlier this month to consult with chinese leaders on 
opposing changes in the communist world 
many south koreans hope the changes in communist nations 
eventually will have an impact on even north korea and that there 
will be a reduction in tension that could one day end the division 
of the peninsula 
the force of an avalanche is too strong to resist forever 
said the korea herald in a nov 12 editorial

an exclusive country club concerned 
with keeping its image off the chests of thousands stopped designer 
ralph lauren from selling shirts emblazoned with a design similar 
to the clubs crest 
us district court judge clyde hamilton in florence signed a 
settlement friday ordering ralph lauren corp to stop selling the 
shirts with the disputed design though he exempted those already 
at retailers 
lauren must pay pine lakes international country club 100000 
in legal fees and an additional 250000 as part of the settlement 
which did not assign any wrongdoing 
club president a sanford miles who called the suit a david 
and goliath conflict said money was not the issue in the lawsuit 
we were protecting the image of the club miles said we 
felt it had been a mark that represented us and our heritage and 
prestige in the community 
the country club was established in 1927 and has a membership of 
250 it prides itself on maintaining a scottish flavor with 
employees dressed in scottish kilts on its golf course serving 
homemade clam chowder cooked in iron pots over open fires 
pine lakes sued ralph lauren more than a year ago charging the 
clubs 1971 trademark was violated the pine lakes crest is used on 
golf shirts hats and blazers and is used in promoting the club 
the 3yearold lauren logo has a crown above a circle within a 
circle in the center of the smaller circle are the letters rl 
the design has been used on thousands of shirts 
it is one of three labels that adorn shirts by polo the 
topselling shirt features a polo player on a pony and was not 
involved in the suit 
pine lakes suit said the rl logo was confusingly and 
deceptively similar to the clubs crest 
polo disagreed saying there was no trademark infringement 
lauren spokeswoman nancy aronson called the result a compromise 
she said the company had planned to stop selling shirts with the 
disputed logo but could not offer a reason

sudden reforms in the eastern bloc have historians 
scrambling to replace old assumptions that are being eradicated as 
quickly as sections of the berlin wall 
history books already need updating to reflect last weeks 
stunning events in east germany and academics and their students 
watch as each days headlines make the previous days reading 
assignment obsolete 
the rules are changing by the hour professor carol saivetz 
of harvard universitys russian research center said monday no 
one is writing and no one is willing to commit themselves because 
once you write a book its out of date 
the east german government shocked the world including many of 
those who study the regions politics with its announcement last 
week that citizens were free to travel to the west 
suddenly the 28yearold berlin wall that ultimate cold war 
symbol was being dismantled the old iron curtain mentality that 
permeates todays books on modern european history already 
undercut by the thaw in ussoviet relations and other east bloc 
reforms suffered a staggering blow 
were all sort of grappling with what to do next and how to 
approach this area of the world that weve been teaching about for 
years given the fastpaced changes that are going on said 
saivetz who also teaches political science at tufts university 
edwin gere a historian at the university of massachusetts in 
amherst said his lesson plans were jolted this semester by the 
events in east germany czechoslovakia bulgaria and hungary 
talk about changing the class curriculum gere said we 
were going to talk in the coming weeks about whether the wall would 
ever come down my god we never had a chance to get to it 
the changes sweeping the region will affect cultural political 
and economic relationships with the west academics said 
it was almost inevitable that all these east european 
communist regimes would explode one way or another said adam 
ulam director of harvards russian research center but this has 
been spectacular 
different events have piled one on top of another with a 
suddenness no one anticipated said boston university professor 
walter d connor 
he said however change in the eastern bloc was inevitable 
given domestic dissatisfaction and soviet premier mikhail 
gorbachevs reforms 
william parker a professor emeritus of economic history at yale 
university said its too soon to know what eventually will 
happen with such a freefloating situation 
but he predicted the eastern bloc countries would now be a 
factor in 1992 when western european nations plan to drop their 
trade barriers 
its conceivable that all those countries would float into a 
common european market parker suggested 
philippe schmitter director of the center for european studies 
at stanford university said that recent events would be 
interpreted not just as a major step toward german reunification 
but also as part of europes unification 
as of six months ago the only thing my students were talking 
about was 1992 schmitter said referring to the trade agreement 
now all of a sudden we have have to think about a whole new set 
of combinations

an antibusing school initiative narrowly passed 
after absentee ballots were counted but the school board head said 
he was unsure whether the measure would be enacted 
the save our schools initiative that went before the voters 
last tuesday received 71046 votes in favor or 504 percent to 
69911 against or 496 percent elections officials said monday 
after counting the ballots 
initiative 34 asks the school board to ban the busing of 
students for racial balance it does not require a ban it says 
that if the board agreed to stop busing 6 percent of the citys 
sales tax revenues about 45 million would be awarded to the 
school district for improving school programs in an effort to 
achieve integration voluntarily 
i might call for the school board to vote on the initiative 
wednesday seattle school board president tj vassar said but 
maybe it might be better to allow the courts to rule it 
unconstitutional 
kathy baxter head of the proinitiative forces said supporters 
will lobby the board to accept the measure 
what weve been able to do by getting the initiative passed is 
give the school board another tool to deal with busing she said 
if the board votes to accept the initiative a lawsuit would be 
filed against the school district by the american civil liberties 
union of washington the national association for the advancement 
of colored people and the church council of greater seattle the 
aclu said in a statement monday 
the antibusing initiative was a key issue in the mayors race 
it was drafted by threeterm city attorney douglas n jewett 
who lost the race after using the issue as his main campaign 
vehicle 
voters elected threeterm city council member norman b rice 
who will be the citys first black mayor

a wall street skyscraper allegedly bought by 
ferdinand marcos with money looted from the philippine treasury was 
auctioned off for 77 million 
the 66story office tower sold monday is one of four new york 
buildings owned by the late philippine president and presently tied 
up in an ownership dispute and in wrangling with the government of 
his homeland 
one of the other buildings the herald center near macys 
department store sold last week for 25 million and two other 
buildings in prime locations are to be auctioned as well 
the government of philippine president corzon aquino is trying 
to recover funds it accuses marcos of spiriting out of the country 
when he fled to hawaii he died in honolulu in september 
the tower at 40 wall st was sold at a foreclosure auction to a 
group of investors led by real estate developer burton j resnick 
who also was involved in a bid for the building in august 
the previous bid of 1086 million fell through when the buyers 
were unable to come up with the money before an october closing 
date 
you just have a generally declining real estate market in 
manhattan particularly in wall street said stephen estroff the 
courtappointed special master in charge of the auction explaining 
the price difference 
the bid was 77 million plus 100 just enough to top the bid 
put in by the mortgage holder citibank to ensure the purchase 
price covered the banks debts

amnesty international said in a report today that 
human rights have suffered a dramatic deterioration in parts of 
latin america in the last 1 years singling out colombia peru 
guatemala and el salvador 
the international human rights group accused security forces in 
colombia of 2500 political killings and blamed authorities in peru 
and guatemala for the disappearances torture or execution of 
hundreds 
it appealed to the organization of american states whose 
foreign ministers were meeting in washington to demonstrate the 
political will to help eradicate abhorrent human rights 
violations by government forces and paramilitary groups linked to 
them 
in its catalogue of allegations amnesty reported that since 
1988 
more than 2500 civilians in colombia have been unlawfully 
killed for political reasons by the army and paramilitary forces 
working for them and more than 300 people have disappeared 
hundreds of peruvians have disappeared been tortured or 
killed by government forces 
in guatemala hundreds of victims reportedly disappeared or 
were illegally executed by members of the security forces operating 
in uniform or clandestinely in the guise of death squads 
in el salvador now mired in some of the worst fighting of its 
decadeold civil war there was persuasive evidence that police 
and military personnel carried out abductions disappearances and 
politically motivated killings attributed to death squads 
amnesty said it has also received reports this year of illegal 
executions or disappearances in other countries in the region 
including brazil and nicaragua 
it said several countries continued to use the death penalty 
which it considers cruel and unusual punishment 
the group noted that so far this year 14 prisoners have been 
executed in the united states and the death row population grew by 
july to an unprecedented 2210 inmates including 28 juveniles 
amnesty said torture is widespread in latin america and was 
routinely reported in countries where counterinsurgency policies 
resulted in patterns of grave human rights violations including 
peru colombia guatemala and el salvador 
amnesty said it was also concerned about torture reports from 
brazil chile ecuador mexico panama and venezuela 
it said political prisoners were being detained in cuba and 
panama 
amnesty said it welcomed the decision by the organization of 
american states to draft an interamerican convention of forced 
disappearance of persons 
it said such a document should prohibit secret detention 
require that detainees be held only in recognized places of 
detention and call for readily accessible uptodate registers of 
detained people 
amnesty also said it was important that governments should not 
take pretrial measures to exonerate those accused in 
disappearances 
it expressed concern about the 1988 presidential pardon of 
argentine military officers charged with human rights violations 
it said the move effectively obstructed further investigation into 
the disappearance of thousands of people under military governments 
in the 1970s and early 1980s

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc scored substantial gains in nationwide trade union 
elections billed as a referendum on likuds stance on middle east 
peace returns showed today 
however the leftofcenter labor party also claimed victory in 
mondays voting saying it had cut likuds momentum from recent 
victories at the polls 
results released by israel radio today showed that with more 
than 90 percent of the vote counted likud won 275 percent an 
increase over its current 22 percent 
labor likuds partner in the coalition government garnered 
more than 55 percent support just slightly more than its present 
standing 
the remaining votes went to three smaller leftwing parties 
the elections were for leaders of the histadrut labor 
federation a traditional labor stronghold the 15 millionmember 
organization helps determine israeli labor policies and owns a 
major chunk of the nations farms and industries 
likud leaders claimed the electoral showing was a boost to 
shamir as he headed to washington for talks with president bush on 
wednesday about efforts to start israelipalestinian peace talks 
i can only say likud has increased its strength in the 
histadrut by about 25 percent this is a significant increase under 
difficult conditions in a game it is not used to playing in 
shamir said on the radio before boarding an airplane for his 11day 
us trip 
i think it is a serious achievement shamir added i can 
explain the addition to our strength on the basis of likuds 
political achievements 
shamir had called the elections a national referendum on his 
stance for talks with palestinians which include an adamant refusal 
to include the plo in negotiations or trade territory for peace 
labor favors a more conciliatory approach including withdrawing 
from parts of the occupied west bank and gaza strip in exchange for 
peace 
labor saw the results as a victory because it stopped a 
worrisome electoral losing streak to likud the rightwing bloc has 
won national and local elections in the past year 
analysts also noted that likud fell short of its goal of 
attaining one third representation on the histadruts governing 
council which would have meant blocking exclusive labor control 
labor party leader and vice premier shimon peres interviewed 
after television projections monday night claimed his party had 
emerged victorious 
this shows the public has given renewed confidence to the 
labor party and we will reach new heights he said 
in the elections about 15 million israelis chose delegates to 
the 1501member histadrut conference which selects the 
organizations governing board voter turnout was more than 50 
percent israeli media reported 
the histadrut which is hebrew for union was founded in 
1920 it in effect helps formulate national employment policies by 
negotiating nationally binding wage and pension agreements with the 
government

irans spiritual leader has appointed the 
son of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini as one of his 
representatives in the newly formed supreme national security 
council tehran radio reported 
the broadcast said ayatollah ali khamenei on monday appointed 
ahmad khomeini to represent him in the council for a term of three 
years 
the council is charged with overseeing defense and state 
security policy as well as coordinating the activities of various 
defense and intelligence bodies 
according to the constitution the council is under the 
jurisdiction of president hashemi rafsanjani a socalled 
pragmatist opposed by the rival radical camp 
in september the president appointed interior minister abdollah 
nouri to head the council last month he asked hassan rowhani who 
previously headed the parliamentary defense committee to help set 
it up 
rowhani was also appointed by khamenei to the council on monday 
rafsanjani elected in july has been trying to overhaul the 
government to weed out radicals who oppose his liberal policies 
the 56yearold president believes in easing the governments 
stranglehold on the economy encouraging foreign investment to 
boost the sluggish economy and moderating irans radical image 
abroad 
but his rivals in the radical camp headed by ahmad khomeini and 
former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi regard such changes 
as anathema 
despite earlier speculation ahmad was not given any important 
post in the new government similarly mohtashemi the most 
powerful figure among the radicals was dropped from rafsanjanis

the state will seek the death penalty 
for a couple accused of killing three men they employed on their 
northwestern missouri farm 
ray copeland 75 and his 68yearold wife faye were charged 
monday at the livingston county courthouse with three counts of 
firstdegree murder 
county prosecutor doug roberts and missouri attorney general 
william webster announced the decision to seek the death penalty at 
a news conference before the copelands were arraigned in separate 
proceedings 
asked why the state would seek an execution of an elderly 
couple webster said it isnt the death penalty because of the 
age its the death penalty because of the alleged offenses here 
the decision to seek capital punishment in the case was based on

a powerful explosion ripped through 
the national headquarters of the election commission today five 
days before a controversial referendum on moslem autonomy police 
said one person was killed 
police said the 705 pm blast damaged the left side of the 
commission on elections building destroying four rooms the blast 
also damaged windows in the nearby manila roman catholic cathedral 
a parttime maintenance man was killed police said officials 
said several employees were working overtime in the building at the 
time of the explosion 
there were no arrests and no one claimed responsibility but 
police said two passersby were taken into custody for questioning 
commission officials had requested additional security at the 
building because of reports that moslems planned a demonstration 
there wednesday to protest the upcoming referendum on regional 
autonomy for mindanao and other southern islands 
on sunday voters in 13 southern provinces and nine cities will 
decide whether to join an autonomous regional government aimed at 
satisfying demands for selfrule by the estimated 4 million 
filipino moslems and ending a nearly 20yearold islamic revolt 
but critics and supporters of the autonomy plan approved by 
congress and signed by president corazon aquino in august fear it 
may fall short of its goals and anger both christians and moslems 
the moro national liberation front the main moslem rebel 
organization has opposed the autonomy plan as inadequate 
in jiddah saudi arabia front leader nur misuari claimed 
president corazon aquinos government was setting the stage for a 
genocidal war against filipino moslems 
the front has been waging a nearly 20year insurgency to 
establish a separate state in mindanao and other southern islands 
a ceasefire with the government has been in effect since mrs 
aquino met misuari in 1986 on the island province of sulu 
before the moslem rebellion peaked in the mid1970s an 
estimated 50000 people were killed and thousands more fled for the 
nearby malaysian state of sabah

a state appeals court turned aside defense 
objections and allowed a second black to remain on the jury for 
todays start of the manslaughter trial of a policeman in the 
shooting of a black motorcyclist 
the court monday upheld the decision of circuit judge joseph 
farina who maintained the defense opted to exclude the juror 
illegally on the basis of race farina seated the juror friday even 
though defense attorneys have a right known as peremptory 
challenge to exclude jurors without showing cause 
the appeals court said there was no need to dissolve the 
sixmember jury and start the painstaking selection process all 
over again 
obviously im happy that were able to proceed said 
prosecutor john hogan we think its a fair jury 
hogan said the session would begin this afternoon although 
opening arguments may not start until wednesday because of pretrial 
motions and problems with sequestering a jury 
the ruling came after three weeks of jury selection in the case 
of officer william lozano who is charged in the slaying of the 
motorcyclist and the death of his passenger in an ensuing crash 
jan 16 the incident set off three days of riots 
lozanos attorney roy black accepted one black juror and 
strenuously denied that race was behind his trying to exclude the 
second black juror ezra simmons 
black said he wanted simmons excluded because as a union 
representative simmons defended workers fired for alleged drug 
abuse the defense intends to emphasize the victims drug use to 
support its contention that lozano shot clement lloyd 23 in 
selfdefense because the motorcyclist was trying to run him over 
with simmons the jury consists of two blacks one hispanic and 
three nonhispanic whites 
the issue of race has hung over the case since the shooting 
three times in the 1980s the killing of black men by white 
officers or the officers acquittals on similar charges have 
sparked rioting in the miami area

the ruling politburo has summoned the entire 
communist leadership of lithuania to a meeting that likely will 
press kremlin efforts to rein in the baltic republics drive for 
sovereignty legislators said today 
the politburo of the baltic republics communist party will 
travel to moscow on wednesday but there was no immediate detail on 
what would be discussed the politburo normally meets on thursdays 
lithuanian sources said moscow may want to discuss calls for the 
republics party to declare itself independent from the national 
party a series of laws that the kremlin declared unconstitutional 
on friday or to head off an attempt to follow baltic neighbor 
estonia in annulling the 1940 decision to join the soviet union 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri d gremitskykh asked 
about the report at a news briefing said he had no information but 
that it was not unusual for a republics entire party leadership to 
attend a politburo session 
eduardas vilkas a deputy of the supreme soviet parliament said 
he thought the topic would be proposals that the lithuanian party 
declare itself independent from the national communist party 
that topic is to be discussed at a congress of the lithuanian 
party scheduled for dec 19 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has criticized suggestions 
that the communist party in the republics spin off into independent 
organizations 
kazimieras motieka a second deputy said the topic might be a 
declaration by the presidium of the supreme soviet parliament 
canceling several decisions at the heart of the drive by republics 
for more political cultural and economic autonomy 
the presidium declared that laws passed by lithuania latvia 
and estonia in the baltics as well as azerbaijan in the southern 
caucasus region giving them the right to veto national laws 
violate the soviet constitution 
lithuanian law that restricts republic citizenship to those who 
lived there when the law was passed earlier this year have a 
permanent job or means of subsistence also violate the 
constitution it declared 
it also found that laws adopted by the three baltic states that 
make lithuanian latvian and estonian the official language in the 
respective republics violate the rights of some people to hold a 
wide range of jobs 
the presidium urged the republics to rewrite their laws

a lawyer accused of misconduct for his role in 
the tawana brawley case failed to appear before a disciplinary 
panel and risks suspension 
alton maddox had been ordered to appear monday before the 
grievance committee but he said it was unethical and 
unconstitutional for the committee to force him to disclose 
information he had obtained as miss brawleys lawyer 
miss brawley claimed she was abducted and raped by six white men 
in 1987 a grand jury concluded last fall after a sevenmonth 
investigation that the black teenager had made up the story 
on advice from maddox attorney c vernon mason and the rev al 
sharpton miss brawley did not cooperate with police or grand jury 
investigations maddox claimed authorities were engaged in a racist 
coverup 
attorney general robert abrams the special prosecutor in the 
case filed a complaint charging that maddox and mason knowingly 
made false statements helped the brawley family in illegal 
conduct told them to leave the state to evade the law and 
obstructed justice 
charges also were filed against maddox by a prosecutor 
implicated in the attack by maddox without substantiation 
robert straus chief counsel to the committee said lawyers 
have an obligation to cooperate with investigators and an 
attorney who does not cooperate is guilty of professional 
misconduct whether or not the underlying allegations are proven 
the committee an agency of the state supreme court can apply 
to the court to have a lawyer suspended for failing to cooperate 
he said 
maddox said he expected the committee would begin suspension 
proceedings against him 
serious allegations of misconduct can result in disbarment

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
laid a wreath at the auschwitz death camp today after assuring 
polish lawmakers that a reunified germany would not threaten polish 
security 
later kohl and solidarity prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
signed a declaration that opens the way for greater economic and 
political cooperation and repeats west german commitments to 
respect polands western border 
the 78point document aims to heal the wounds of the past 
through understanding and reconciliation leaders expressed hope 
for a new chapter in relations between west germany and poland led 
by the first noncommunist government in the east bloc 
at auschwitz kohl laid the flowers at the wall of death 
where the nazis had prisoners of different nationalities shot and 
another in birkenau where crematoriums incinerated the bodies of 
millions of hitlers victims 
he did not speak polish television broadcast part of the visit 
live to the nation to somber music of chopin 
kohl was accompanied by heinz galinski head of the west german 
jewish community council and polands only rabbi menachem 
joskowicz of warsaw at least 25 million jews were among the 
victims at auschwitz and birkenau 
a small group of people held up banners outside the camp saying 
victims of the war demand compensation and all of germany is 
responsible for the crime of genocide and the plunder of poland and 
europe 
kohl was not the first west german leader to visit auschwitz 
chancellor helmut schmidt visited the camp in 1977 
but kohls fiveday trip which ends today comes at a time of 
tremendous upheaval in the east bloc and less than a week after 
east germans communist leaders punched holes in the berlin wall 
and let their people travel freely to the west 
the rapid pace of change in east germany where lawmakers on 
monday endorsed opposition calls for free elections has prompted 
serious discussion about prospects for a reunified germany 
the idea worries many poles and west german officials have 
sought during kohls visit to allay fears that a reunified germany 
would threaten polish security 
they have told their polish hosts that such a germany would 
respect a 1970 treaty that pledges bonn to respect the oder and 
neisse rivers as polands western border 
some west german conservatives have suggested that reunification 
be sought within 1937 borders which encompass about onethird of 
poland 
speaking monday to polish lawmakers kohl stressed that a 
reunified germany would not be a threat to poland because it would 
be part of a new european order based on cooperation and respect 
for freedom 
kohls remarks were reported by senate marshal andrzej 
stelmachowski a solidarity adviser 
stelmachowski said kohl told the lawmakers that in general he 
thinks that the process of reunification would be a process 
connected with the general process of unification of europe and 
the 21st century would not be a time of national states 
stelmachowski said he was satisfied with kohls appearance

foreign minister gyula horn said in an 
interview published today that opponents of change could sabotage 
reform efforts in east bloc countries by exploiting the disgruntled 
masses 
hungary poland and the soviet union have been at the forefront 
of east bloc reform but the rapid changes in east germany and the 
recent leadership change in bulgaria have left only czechoslovakia 
and romania still resisting political reform 
even czechoslovakia today however substantially loosened 
travel restrictions on its citizens 
in an interview with the government daily magyar hirlap horn 
said the warsaw pact countries who want to carry out reform have 
attained genuine majority 
the changes in east germany reinforced hungarian reforms he 
said but he cautioned against being overly optimistic saying 
there are still too many dangers lurking in wait 
i consider the economy in every warsaw treaty member state 
to be in a critical state which is a serious source of danger 
horn said noting that economic reforms would take years to have an 
effect 
disappointed and resigned people who are in a state of apathy 
and cannot directly feel the effects of political changes on their 
own living conditions can be easily exploited by the political 
circles that want to slow down or halt transformation horn said 
this is the gravest danger he added

a group that fought a guerrilla war 
with south africa finished first in elections that will lead 
namibia to independence but failed to win enough voes to claim 
total power unofficial results showed today 
thousands of people who were pleased that the southwest africa 
peoples organization at least won a majority thronged the streets 
of the capital and adjoining townships today waving flags singing 
and honking horns 
we are very happy we struggled all the years for this day 
said sam nujoma president of the black nationalist group 
with figures in from all 23 districts swapo won 331597 votes 
about 57 percent of 577974unchallenged votes cast its main rival 
the democratic turnhalle alliance won 165230 votes or about 28 
percent the remaining votes were split between eight smaller 
parties 
authorities were reviewing 96281 ballots to determine their 
validity but even if swapo won all the questioned votes it would 
fall short of its target of a twothirds majority 
at stake in the election conducted last week under un 
supervision were 72 seats in an assembly that will write a 
constitution and declare independence for namibia sometime next 
year after 74 years of south african rule 
swapos leaders had predicted their leftist movement which took 
up arms against south africa in 1966 would easily win the 
twothirds majority that would have enabled it to write the 
constitution without consulting other parties 
instead it will need to bargain with its rivals notably the 
democratic turnhalle alliance a multiracial coalition that served 
in the south africaninstalled transitional government and favors a 
capitalist economy 
the unofficial results were disclosed by election officials 
prior to the final certification by the head of the un monitoring 
force martti ahtisaari only after the official figures are 
announced will the exact breakdown of assembly seats be known 
swapo had trailed the democratic turnhalle alliance throughout 
the counting process which began monday morning and only overtook 
its rival with the tallying of votes from the last of the 23 
districts the heavily populated northern region of ovambo 
swapos stronghold 
there according to the unofficial returns swapo polled 197100 
votes to 9200 for the alliance leapfrogging into the lead 
in addition to the two frontrunners only two of the other 
parties appeared assured of winning seats in the assembly these 
were the united democratic front not related to the south african 
antiapartheid group of the same name and the allwhite action 
christian national 
about 6 percent of namibias 13 million people are white 
after the polls closed saturday ahtisaari formally declared the 
fiveday election free and fair in terms of the un 
requirements 
he said the 95 percent turnout of registered voters has given 
the whole world an exemplary lesson in democracy 
swapo officials on monday agreed that the elections were free 
but said they still had questions about the fairness they said 
some of the ballot boxes that arrived in windhoek did not have the 
un seal on them as required 
territorial election officials denied any such irregularities 
south africa captured the territory from germany in world war i 
and ruled it under a league of nations mandate subsequently 
rescinded by the united nations 
south africa refused un orders to withdraw from the territory 
until an agreement was signed in december which also provided for 
cuban troops to leave neighboring angola

european economic community hoped to gain support of other 
western nations for a 210 million food supply action in early

a stimulating one we would like to inspire all partners to 
contribute wegter said

antiapartheid protesters cheered dartmouth 
colleges decision to stop investing in companies that do business 
in south africa 
it was inevitable that the trustees divest all credit should 
be given to students faculty and community members who have 
applied pressure for the past 20 years said gamal abouali a 
senior who protested dartmouths investments 
the ivy league school announced monday it will sell by the end 
of the year its 115 million in investments in companies doing 
business in south africa 
the undergraduate faculty council voted unanimously in 1988 to 
call on trustees to divest completely within a year however the 
decision came unexpectedly at a weekend trustees meeting at which 
divestment was not on the agenda 
dartmouth president james freedman read the decision at a 
faculty meeting to cheers from the 250 to 300 students present 
the trustees said in a statement that the investments have 
great symbolic meaning and the continuing dispute over them 
undermine dartmouths ability to achieve some of its educational 
goals 
the board noted that dartmouths investments in companies doing 
business with south africa have declined from 15 percent or 63 
million of its endowment in 1985 to less than 2 percent this year 
the college already had accepted prohibitions against 
investments in south african firms financial institutions making 
loans to the south african government companies supplying goods 
and services involved in the enforcement of apartheid and firms 
doing business in south africa that didnt adhere to certain 
employment policies 
in 1985 students built shanties on campus to protest apartheid 
in 1986 12 students attacked the shanties with sledgehammers a 
confrontation over moving the shanties off campus resulted in 18 
arrests

in neighboring afghanistan 
another of pakistans close allies the united states has 
proposed sanctions against china in response to the peoples armys

republic after its emergence in 1949 karachi was its first 
international air link ms bhuttos first official trip after 
taking office last december was to beijing 
light poles and buildings fluttered today with banners bearing

negotiators from the senate and house 
deadlocked today on whether catastrophic medical coverage for 
retirees should be scaled back sharply or repealed outright 
house conferees insisted on repeal of the yearold program just 
as the full house had done senate negotiators seeing no movement 
from the house responded by insisting that the provision of the 
law covering hospital costs be retained 
we havent made any progress on catastrophic sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate negotiators told 
reporters he assailed the bush administration for taking a 
handsoff position on the issue 
i frankly dont see the white house exercising any leadership 
on catastrophic bentsen said i dont know where they are id 
be delighted to find out 
the administration took the same stand earlier this year when 
the house and senate battled over the fate of the landmark medical 
insurance program at one point health secretary louis sullivan 
endorsed one senate proposal for salvaging parts of the program 
only to have budget director richard g darman insist that sullivan 
was not speaking for the administration 
if house and senate negotiators are unable to agree on what to 
do about catastrophic the law will remain on the books and 
coverage under the program will be expanded in january 
however congressional aides on both sides of the issue say a 
longterm stalemate is unlikely that is because congress has been 
deluged with mail from many retirees who oppose parts of the 
program the biggest sore spot is the income surtax paid only by 
40 percent of retirees that finances most of the program 
both houses of congress voted to repeal the surtax the senate 
bill would retain a flat 4amonth premium that is paid by all but 
the poorest retirees that premium would continue protection 
against high hospital bills but provide no coverage for doctor 
bills or prescription drugs

family farmers from the leading soybeanproducing 
states sued the chicago board of trade today accusing it of 
illegally manipulating prices 
the federal suit was filed by individual farmers and the 
american agriculture movement a lobbying group that represents 
small farmers and rural businessmen in 34 states 
at issue is last summers collapse of soybean prices which the 
farmers blame on an emergency order july 11 by the board of trade 
to sell off all large holdings in soybeans 
the order was widely viewed as an effort to break up an alleged 
attempt to corner the market by ferruzzi finanziaria spa one of 
the worlds largest soybean processors 
the farm organization said in a statement that the order was a 
badfaith and selfserving action initiated by the bots 
dominant members including major soybean merchants to create 
profits 
it said the resulting drop in soybean prices could cost the 
rural economy farmers rural bankers implement dealers and others 
well over 1 billion 
board chairman karsten mahlmann said the bot considers the 
lawsuit frivolous he said the board had acted to maintain order in 
the market and that the commodity futures trading commission had

dissent emerged tuesday at a vatican 
conference on aids with delegates complaining that no voice was 
given to victims of the disease themselves 
after negotiations with the president of the conference 
vaticanbased archbishop fiorenzo angelini about 50 delegates 
organized a separate meeting in a side room to discuss their own 
agenda for dealing with aids 
many alleged the conference allowed no room for debate or 
questions some expressed concern that official speakers were 
focusing too much on the sexual behavior and drug use that can 
cause aids 
the group included peter larkin a 34yearold aids victim from 
london 
im quite distressed as someone with aids that this conference 
with so many important speakers does not include one person with 
aids he said im being told how and what to think but im 
not being asked were getting very very angry because were 
ignored 
the group decided to ask conference organizers to let larkin 
address the threeday meeting which ends wednesday with a speech 
by pope john paul ii there was no immediate indication of whether 
the request would be accepted 
angelini referred to the criticism telling the conference that 
aids victims were represented but their confidentiality should be 
respected 
an irish priest with the aids virus was ejected from the 
conference monday when he stood up wearing a sandwichboard with 
the slogan the church has aids 
the priest the rev john white heads an aids care center 
called london lighthouse he was invited back to the conference 
tuesday by angelini 
no voice was given to people living with aids said white 
43 who contracted the virus while working as a missionary in 
kenya it seemed to be a conference where delegates were meant to 
be totally passive 
the berlin wall is coming down but new walls are coming up 
here added robert kunst head of a group called cure aids 
now that supplies meals to aids patients in miami its been 
the usual focus on gay bashing and abstention in sex the real 
issues of care are not being addressed its all rubberstamped 
the rev carl meirose who heads a program for pastoral care of 
aids victims in chicago said this is the worst conference ive 
ever attended there is no chance for dialogue or interaction 
there is no voice for any voice 
cardinal john oconnor of new york who gave the opening address 
monday agreed the conference could have been organized differently 
i would have included people with handson activity including 
persons with aids he told reporters i would also include 
periods of discussion and exchange of ideas 
tuesdays official speeches focused less on the highrisk 
behavior that can lead to aids and more on scientific and medical 
questions 
edmund pellegrino director of the center for the advanced study 
of ethics at georgetown university said doctors have a moral 
obligation to treat aids patients without discrimination those 
who refuse should be suspended or have their license revoked he 
said 
pellegrino said doctors also have a duty to break the rule of 
confidentiality and advise one spouse if the other spouse has aids 
with or without the partners consent 
wade parks head of the pedriatics department at the university 
of miami said all pregnant women should be tested for the aids 
virus just as they are for syphillis 
parks said most women who give birth to seropositive babies did 
not know beforehand that they carried the aids virus themselves

west germany today offered massive financial aid 
to east germany if the communist nation revamps its centralized 
economy and west berlins mayor warned of economic problems caused 
by the newly opened borders 
also today east germanys new premier called for a coalition 
government but gave no indication the opposition will be part in 
it despite widespread protests pressing for an end to the 
communist monopoly on power 
hans modrow considered a reformer also said the berlin wall 
though open to travel must remain standing to keep aids crime and 
other western problems out of his communist country a newspaper 
said today 
a leader of east germanys biggest opposition group new forum 
said today that the movement could work with a revamped communist 
party but that naming modrow premier was not enough 
also today the official east german news agency adn reported 
that the government was considering opening part of the berlin wall 
near the brandenburg gate as yet another passage between east and 
west berlin the gate a huge columned monument is one of the 
citys bestknown symbols 
before east germany opened its borders the gate had been a 
major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to travel to 
the west 
since the opening of east germanys borders last week there has 
been growing speculation and concern about the implications for the 
east german and west german economies 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann in announcing 
the aid package today compared his conditional offer to the 
marshall plan put together by the united states to help europe 
recover from world war ii destruction 
haussmann did not name a figure for the proposed aid and said 
the plan would be useless if east germany did not carry out a 
thorough change of its troubled centrally planned economy 
speaking to reporters in bonn haussmann said reforms promised 
by east germanys new communist party leader egon krenz had so far 
led to more questions than answers 
the minister said the aid plan being offered by bonn would 
include massive investments in east germany and joint ventures as 
well as revamping east germanys outdated communications and 
transport system 
east germanys communist governments in the past have flatly 
ruled out freemarket principles in the socialist state 
west berlin mayor walter momper urged the federal government to 
meet with east german officials to discuss pressing economic 
problems created by the sudden opening of east germanys borders 
among the issues mentioned by momper were currency problems 
traffic and other economic problems 
modrow was chosen monday in a session of unprecedented 
liveliness in east germanys parliament lawmakers long 
subservient to the communist leadership voted by secret ballot for 
the first time and endorsed opposition calls for free elections 
they also elected their first noncommunist parliament speaker 
some deputies even called for stripping the constitution of a 
clause that designates the country socialist 
the communist party daily newspaper neues deutschland 
acknowledged today the country is in a deep crisis but is 
experiencing an awakening leading toward change 
modrow 61 is an antiestablishment communist figure who built 
his power base from his former position as dresdens communist 
party chief he replaced willi stoph who resigned last week along 
with his entire 44member cabinet 
the new premier supports stepbystep economic reforms 
including the scaling down of east germanys ponderous government 
bureaucracy 
still modrow said the government has no intention of tearing 
down the berlin wall despite carving new passages through it for 
the past five days in an effort to halt an exodus of refugees and 
growing public unrest 
in our country there is little criminal activity cases of 
aids and drugs are virtually unknown our people are asking 
themselves why they shouldnt just leave that as it is west 
germanys bild newspaper quoted modrow as saying 
he said doing away with the barrier completely could cause 
chaos echoing the communist line that the wall was designed to 
protect east germany from threats of the west 
modrow is to present his cabinet on friday the official adn 
news agency quoted him as saying monday night that the country 
needs a real coalition government 
this will naturally be a broader cooperation within our 
alliance he said referring to four small communistaligned 
parties that have had cabinet positions in the past but never 
important ones 
there was no indication he intended to offer cabinet ministries 
to opposition leaders 
the election of modrow came as hundreds of thousands of 
demonstrators gathered around the nation spurred by last weeks 
opening of east germanys borders with the west they shouted 
anticommunist slogans and demanded an end to the partys monopoly 
on power 
in the city of leipzig about 300000 people paraded through the 
streets in what has become a monday night ritual chanting we are 
the people protesters shouted lazy bunch outside the local 
headquarters of the secret police 
juergen tallig the leipzig spokesman for new forum told west 
germanys hesse state radio today i can imagine cooperating with 
a reformed communist party 
he praised modrow as a competent politician but said 
there are still too many people in top positions with whom 
dialogue is not possible 
krenz permanently opened east germanys borders friday in an 
attempt to stop hundreds of thousands of east germans from fleeing 
west and to buy time for his promised reforms 
the gamble appears to have paid off the official adn news 
agency reported that more than 5 million visas had been issued 
since thursday but that only about 10000 people applied to 
emigrate 
mondays frequently uproarious parliamentary session was the 
first translation of east germanys euphoria into concrete 
political action 
during the meeting some parliamentarians blamed the previous 
party and state leadership for the economic and social morass that 
has engulfed this nation of 165 million 
party leader erich honecker was ousted oct 18 at the height of 
the exodus and there have been calls for the entire party central 
committee to step down 
the new speaker of parliament is guenther maleuda the 
communists did not field a challenger to his candidacy maleuda 
heads the democratic peasants one of four noncommunist parties 
that had been allowed to exist in exchange for accepting communist 
supremacy

a district court tuesday sentenced a 
moroccan immigrant to six months in prison for disparaging and 
deeply offending remarks about jews on his radio station radio 
islam 
ahmed rami called the ruling against him judicial murder and 
said he would appeal the conviction 
swedens 15000member jewish community has viewed it as a 
landmark case it is only the second time that a court has 
overridden the right of free speech to enforce an antiracism law 
barring the defamation of a people race or ethnic group 
rami was convicted of 18 counts of broadcasting antisemitic 
remarks including quotes from nazi writings such as adolf hitlers 
mein kampf he has spoken on the air of a jewish conspiracy to 
achieve worldwide power 
the court ruled the statements were clearly disparaging and in 
many cases deeply offending to jews and rami throughout makes 
sweeping statements and refers to jews in general 
the court acquitted him on charges relating to other remarks on 
his weekly program and cautioned that israel and its supporters 
must expect political criticism he also was cleared of all charges 
in connection with his book what is israel 
the verdict was announced a week ago but the written judgment 
and sentence were released tuesday 
this is a judicial murder a scandal and i intend to 
appeal rami told reporters he said he had been judged in a 
political trial and he accused the prosecutor of zionist 
sympathies 
i want to crush the state of israel if i am allowed on 
the air again i will say the same things again he said 
zionism judaism and the state of israel are fakes 
during the eightweek trial the prosecution called in 
distinguished clergymen including retired stockholm lutheran 
bishop krister stendahl and swedish chief rabbi morton narrowe to 
argue that ramis programs were antisemitic 
ramis defense was based on the assertion that his programs were 
not directed against the jewish people but against judaism as an 
ideology and political doctrine 
the local radio board was to decide wednesday whether to suspend 
the stations broadcasting permit rami said 
radio islam like some 2500 independent companies or 
individuals rents air time from the local radio board and is on 
the air for one hour a week 
im disappointed in the swedish legal system he said 
criticizing israel and jews is called persecution while 
criticizing islam is plain criticism he said referring to 
british author salman rusdie and his novel the satanic verses

premier ladislav adamec said today 
that czechoslovak citizens will no longer need exit permits to 
travel outside the country a major reform in one of the last 
hardline east bloc nations 
the announcement comes less than a week after east germany 
lifted most travel restrictions on its citizens and opened its 
borders to the west triggering a flood of visitors to west germany 
in an address to the czechoslovak federal assembly adamec said 
his government regards tourism as the citizens important right 
to get to know the world gain experience and establish personal 
contacts 
czechoslovakia has been among the most resistant countries in 
the east bloc to the sovietstyle political reforms sweeping 
poland hungary and now east germany it has crushed public dissent 
and jailed protesters calling for democratic reforms police used 
truncheons and arrested scores during proreform demonstrations in 
october 
during the summer the government eased some travel restrictions 
but did not lift the requirement for an exit visa when traveling to 
the west authorities have often refused to allow leading 
dissidents to travel abroad 
in washingotn president bush hailed the development 
the people of czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for 
freedom that others have and i would expect wed see further 
changes there just as we have seen in poland hungary and in the 
german democratic republic east germany so its a very good and 
encouraging step the president said 
adamec said the government was changing the law to make travel 
easier he did not say when the new rule would take effect but it 
was expected to begin in january 
the processing of travel documents is being speeded up 
adamec said for travel to nonsocialist countries and to 
yugoslavia exit visas will not be necessary yugoslavia is a 
communist country but is not aligned with the warsaw pact so 
travel to it had been restricted 
currently czechoslovak citizens wishing to travel west must 
apply for exit visas with the interior ministry before a trip is 
authorized wouldbe travelers must also obtain stamps from their 
employers and from military authorities there is a 3oday waiting 
period 
in july the government lifted the rule requiring that 
invitations for czechoslovak citizens to visit the west come from 
family members it began recognizing invitations from anyone living 
in the west including emigres even those who had left their 
country illegally 
the government had also lifted restrictions on czechoslovaks 
wishing to emigrate to join family members who had left the country 
illegally 
czechoslovaks still will need visas from the countries they wish 
to visit 
earlier this year czechoslovakia began granting visas to 
austrian and west german citizens at selected border crossings and 
speeded up the issuance of visas for western correspondents in 
most cases they now can receive visas in a day rather than having 
to wait up to two weeks 
adamec said that the number of visits by czechoslovak citizens 
to western countries increased last year by 30 percent over the 
previous year 
our aim is that czechoslovakia become a country for which 
travel and tourism represent not only a significant sum in the 
state budget but also the satisfaction of its citizens adamec 
said in the nationally televised speech

czechoslovakia and added were not surprised by anything 
anymore 
bush is under pressure from democratic leaders in the senate and 
house to respond more energetically to developments in the 
communist world 
renewing his criticism senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said today it was regrettable that bush through his 
spokesman has rejected the idea of going to berlin to express 
american satisfaction with the symbolic destruction of the wall 
or to normalize trade relations with the soviet union 
while the president has rejected all of these he has reversed 
himself on issues before and i hold out out hope he will do so 
again mitchell told reporters 
mitchell on monday had urged bush to travel to the berlin wall 
now breached by unrestricted travel by east germans convene a 
meeting of the western allies and suspend trade restrictions 
against the soviet union 
house democratic leader richard a gephardt of missouri 
meanwhile said at the very time freedom and democracy are 
receiving standing ovations in europe our president is sitting 
politely in the audience with little to say and even less to 
contribute 
the administration did not respond publicly but privately the 
two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said bush was 
weighing a meeting with leaders of the 15 other north atlantic 
treaty organization countries after the dec 23 talks in the 
mediterranean with gorbachev 
at the top of the agenda would be the future of germany which 
vice president dan quayle said in a speech monday inevitably will 
be reunited once east germany shakes off communism 
east germany is east germany because of the communist 
system quayle told the republican governors association at 
hilton head island sc do away with the communist system and 
its germany 
despite quayles confident statement a number of us officials 
acknowledged in interviews that the bush administration had to move 
cautiously for two reasons nervousness in western europe about 
restoring germany to full strength and in moscow about us 
intentions 
a militarily powerful germany has been at the center of two 
devastating wars in europe this century 
the officials told the associated press that gorbachev might 
propose to bush in their talks a reunited but neutralized germany 
us strategy they said is to undertake preparations within nato 
and the european community for the potential integration of a 
single germany into a democratic europe 
on this the europeans will have to take the lead a us 
official said

appropriations bill for all agriculture department operations in 
conference committee for weeks 
on tuesday bumpers said hed agree to move the program to the 
fish and wildlife service within the interior department 
he and whitten said theyd talk about it again wednesday 
when you look at what epa is saying about pesticides theres 
not a soul around this table who doesnt know were going to have 
to reduce use of these things said bumpers

the senate moved today toward agreement on a 
compromise 738 million plan to spur the rebirth of democracy and 
free enterprise in poland and hungary 
the bipartisan compromise was announced less than 48 hours 
before lech walesa leader of polands solidarity union movement 
was to address a joint meeting of congress 
formal approval of the plan expected today would be an 
important step toward resolving a long dispute over the size of the 
program 
it almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in 
eastern europe is mindboggling but thank god for it sen 
gordon humphrey rnh said as the debate resumed this morning 
we must do all we can afford as quickly as we can to help 
make these changes in eastern europe irreversible humphrey said 
as the senate approved his amendment to earmark 10 percent of the 
private enterprise funds contained in the bill for solidarity and a 
polish freeenterprise association 
humphrey said the change was necessary to permit some of the 
money to move quickly cutting through bureaucratic delays as 
applications are considered 
senate democrats originally had sought a threeyear 
authorization level for the two east european nations of 989 
millions while republicans called for a 585 million ceiling 
all the proposals including the 840 million authorized earlier 
by the house overshadow the total 455 million proposed over the 
last several months by president bush 
asked today if bush favors the 738 million aid package for 
poland and hungary nearing approval in the senate white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said were generally supportive wed 
like to get billions if we had them 
differences between the house and senate versions of the aid 
package are expected to be resolved quickly 
the senate builds on key elements advocated by the president 
including an enterprise fund to help both nations move away from 
communist centralized planning and toward freemarket systems 
the funds intended to help both countries establish freemarket 
systems would allocate 260 million for poland and 65 million for 
hungary 
in recognition of polands serious economic problems the bill 
allocates 657 million for that country while hungary would receive 
81 million 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas noted democrats had 
dropped a 200 million credit stabilization plan for poland a plan 
he said republicans believed would be unworkable and merely add to 
polands large foreign debt 
the compromise trimmed the rival democratic plan to a more 
realistic size dole said 
poland and hungary remain members of the warsaw pact according 
to dole who said the compromise has a number of safeguards 
including barring any funds from being used for military aid to 
cuba or nicaragua 
meanwhile congressional democrats opened fire on the 
presidents approach to other crucial events in eastern europe 
including east germanys decision to open the berlin wall 28 years 
after it was erected across the divided city 
senate majority leader george mitchell said today it is 
regrettable that bush has rejected the idea of going to berlin 
to express american satisfaction with the symbolic destruction 
of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the soviet union 
while the president has rejected all of these he has reversed 
himself on issues before and i hold out out hope he will do so 
again the maine democrat told reporters 
mitchell said he also believes bush should convene an emergency 
conference of the western allies to chart the future of europe in 
the light of events in the soviet union and eastern europe 
obviously the postworldwar ii era is coming to an end 
marked by the upheaval in eastern europe and the new economic era 
order in western europe mitchell said 
it is important he said that the united states now assert its 
full leadership in shaping that new order 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday he couldnt 
foresee any set of circumstances at this moment that would 
induce bush to go to berlin 
on monday the senate unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming 
the opening of the wall condemning it as a symbol of 
oppression and demanding

the bawling east german infant 
getting real good at this laughed staff sgt levonso 
hemingway of greensboro nc first cook with the 6th infantry 
battalion which for the past week has been operating a soup 
kitchen for refugees pouring through the new holes in the berlin 
wall 
jackie mason chicken soup is on the menu today he said 
yesterday we fed about 5000 today looks even bigger people 
were on line in the dark and cold when i got here at 5 am to turn 
on the portable stoves 
the next infant in line was attached to his mother by the 
headphones of a portable cassette recorder the first tangible 
evidence of the familys flight to freedom 
hes jamming approved hemingway doling out a peanut butter 
and jelly sandwich to the newest hard rock recruit and a package of 
disposable diapers to the beaming mother 
less than three decades ago oct 27 1961 when the cold war 
was at its hottest us patton tanks confronted lowslung soviet 
tanks in a tense 16hour standoff at checkpoint charlie 
now the might of the american military in berlin was on diaper 
detail responding with british and french allies to requests by 
the berlin city government to provide emergency food and bedding 
for the refugees 
they are bedded down on army cots in schools sports halls 
garages and factories some are even sleeping in their tiny east 
germans cars 
many already have health problems said kristian binde a 
paramedic with the red cross he was helping process the new 
arrivals at the army soup kitchen on the third floor of a derelict 
elevator factory where the elevators no longer work 
they have headaches and trouble with breathing from the smog 
and now that the weather has turned so chilly chest colds are 
common especially among the children he said in cases of 
really serious illness like a heart attack the open border now 
works both ways we can send them across to the humboldt university 
hospital in east berlin 
some have problems with alcohol they celebrate their new 
freedom too much and wind up in an ambulance binde said 
erich honecker the recently resigned east german leader was 
given the assignment of building the berlin wall after midnight on 
a summer sunday in 1961 because the best and the brightest under 
communist control were defecting to the west in the previous half 
dozen years more than 17000 engineers and technicians and 6000 
doctors and nurses had fled 
apparently east germanys professional class is on the move 
again at a table in the soup kitchen filling out papers that 
hopefully might find them work were nurse viola spiering and her 
husband sebastian an electrical engineer with their 11yearold 
son they had left robel a small town 70 miles to the north and 
had no idea where they would settle 
perhaps hamburg said mrs spiering who has been plotting 
the family exodus for months we are lucky we stay with an uncle 
here in berlin the boy is very happy he doesnt have to go back 
to school yet 
hans jorg patzig a refugee coordinator for the city of berlin 
said a lot of doctors arrived last week this is a problem 
because a lot of doctors here in west berlin are unemployed we 
have more doctors than we need also public health education 
standards are not very high on the other side so a lot of them 
could be bad doctors he said 
the government is providing free flights to take the refugees to 
jobs in other west german cities patzig said and the us army 
provides buses to take them to the airport 
but even the skilled technicians and engineers have not kept 
pace with the wests computer chip technology 
we get a number of printers and linotype operators who dont 
realize all our newspapers here are done by the offset process 
he said people in the building trades carpenters plumbers 
roofers will have no trouble getting work 
bus driver heinz hammermann is among the volunteers collecting 
clothing and blankets for the refugees he remembers the 
confrontation between the american and the soviets on 
friedrichstrasse we lived close by i hid with my grandparents in 
the cellar they thought world war iii was about to begin 
for thanksgiving hemingway hopes to serve the best of the 
west to the new converts to democracy filling his soup kitchen

senior egyptian and iraqi officials will 
discuss the welfare of about 1 million egyptian workers in iraq 
following reports that more than 100 egyptians died in iraq last 
month 
the foreign ministry is following the issue of egyptian 
workers in iraq and this will be reviewed during the meeting of the 
higher joint egyptianiraqi committee on saturday said foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid 
the government has been handling the affair cautiously and he 
did not refer to reports in the stateowned alakhbar newspaper 
that 102 bodies of egyptians had been flown to cairo in october 
compared with one body in october 1988 
the newspaper also reported that thousands of egyptians were 
buried in iraq because they did not leave enough money for their 
bodies to be sent home and that egyptians were badly treated by 
iraqis 
alakhbar also reported that starting wednesday iraqi airlines 
would start 10 extra flights from baghdad to cairo daily for the 
next three months to fly home egyptian workers 
it quoted iraqi officials in baghdad as saying return of 
egyptian workers in large numbers was not because of 
maltreatment but because soldiers discharged after iraniraq 
war ended were taking jobs once held by egyptians 
some egyptian government officials and the opposition newspaper 
alwafd attribute most of the egyptian deaths to friction between 
iraqis and egyptians and rivalries over jobs 
alakhbar said prime minister atef sedki demanded a full report 
from egypts ambassador to baghdad ibrahim ouf 
on monday a senior security official at cairo international 
airport confirmed that about 100 egyptian bodies were flown from 
iraq in october an average of three or four a day the 
official also said autopsies have been ordered to determine the 
cause of the death 
alakhbar said that iraqi certificates initially attributed 
death to bullet wounds and later switched to other formulas 
like killed in an accident or died in butane gas cylinder 
explosion 
the egyptian government has been cautious in handling the issue 
because of close ties between the two countries millions of 
egyptians work abroad about 1 million in iraq 
one egyptian security official said he did not believe the 
bodies arriving in recent weeks were related to reports of an 
august explosion and fire at an iraqi missile plant that killed 700 
people including many egyptians the high death toll was reported 
by iraqi dissident sources and the london newspaper the independent

lawyers for the state asked the georgia supreme 
court today to rule that a quadriplegic with no hope of improvement 
has the right to shut off the machine that has kept him alive for 
four years 
assistant attorney general william m droze argued that larry 
mcafees death if he disconnected his ventilator would not be 
suicide but the result of the natural progression of his 
condition 
mcafee whose motorcycle injuries four years ago left him 
paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on a respirator already 
won consent in september from a superior court judge to disconnect 
the breathing apparatus 
after ruling in the case judge edward johnson instructed 
attorney general michael bowers to appeal to the states highest 
court for guidance in future cases 
mcafee decided to delay shutting off his ventilator offering 
others more time to try to talk him out of it but his attorney 
leigh smith urged the court to uphold the ruling saying that 
would amount to an affirmation of a competent adults right to 
refuse medical treatment 
the trial judge held that mcafees constitutional right to 
privacy permitted him to disconnect the respirator and that the 
state had no interests outweighing mcafees right to refuse medical 
treatment 
with a friends help mcafee devised a method by which he could 
turn the respirator off himself but he also asked to be given a 
sedative so that he would not suffer once the respirator was 
removed 
on that point johnson ruled that any physician or lawman who 
administered a sedative to mcafee or who helped him in turning off 
the respirator would not be subject to any civil or criminal 
liability 
bowers said monday the issue is legally murky and should be 
resolved by the states highest court 
the question i believe is whether what we have is explicit 
and clear enough concerning the right of a competent person to 
refuse medical treatment bowers said 
we believe that if you take the law as a whole and try to 
distill it you come up with this right but we acknowledge there 
is nothing one could point to and say there is this right 
bowers and other parties in the lawsuit have urged the supreme 
court to use the case to write guidelines allowing people similarly 
situated in the future to gain the removal of lifesustaining 
equipment through nonjudicial means 
the state already has such guidelines for people who have signed 
a living will directing their physicians not to engage in 
heroic means to preserve them in a nonconscious state 
although most righttodie cases involve comatose patients 
or those who cannot make their wishes known a case similar to 
mcafees came up in july a michigan man paralyzed in a surfing 
accident died after a court decided he had the right to have his 
lifesupport system shut off

squads of men armed with iron tongs and 
a poisonous liquid are prowling this populous citys streets and 
alleys with one mission in mind kill as many dogs as possible 
authorities say they have no choice 
we know it is cruelty to kill the dogs says dr rezaul 
karim chief veterinarian of the dhaka municipal crporation we 
must find out an alternative 
karim said the explosion in the numbers of stray dogs has 
created a potential health threat about 30 dogs are killed daily 
which puts only a small dent in a population estimated in the tens 
of thousands 
he said eight dogkilling squads began operating in dhaka on 
oct 1 and killed at least 646 stray dogs in one month the 
campaign will continue until all stray dogs are killed he said 
the dogs are caught by large iron tongs and a poisonous solution 
of magnesium sulfate is injected into the heart killing the 
animals within two minutes said a corporation veterinarian who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
there is no dependable estimate of the street dog population of 
the capital the countrys largest city with 6 million people 
officials believe the figure is between 70000 and 80000 
septemberoctober is the breeding season for dogs when their 
population sometimes reaches 80000 said karim 
the corporation pays 10 takas about 30 cents to the dog 
catchers for every canine captured and killed 
authorities say the main complaints against the animals are that 
they are likely to bite people and spread rabies 
there are no statistics on dog bites but newspapers often 
report dogs attacking and biting people at night when streets are 
deserted 
an official of the veterinary public health department said 
japan has offered about 25 million for a project to vaccinate 
stray dogs against diseases 
the extermination has not evoked any public reaction few 
bangladeshis keep pets and there is no branch of the society for 
prevention of cruelty to animals in the country in 1978 some 
owners of pet dogs formed a kennel club but it closed in 1980 
the dogkilling campaign is deplorable said sadia 
chowdhury a tv newscaster who was a member of the kennel club

czechoslovakia promoting a cautious brand of 
reform will convert part of its renowned munitions industry to 
civilian production a senior prague official said tuesday 
us businessmen are invited to join the new ventures and also 
to use czechoslovakia as a beachhead to potential soviet and other 
east european markets richard sumann director general of the 
foreign trade ministry told the us chamber of commerce 
he spoke as czechoslovakia trailing its neighbors in political 
reform announced the lifting of restrictions on foreign travel by 
its citizens 
we are highly interested in the quickest conversion of 
armament production capacities and shift toward the civil sector 
production sumann said 
his statements reflected recent cautious efforts by 
czechoslovakia to join the trend toward perestroika or 
restructuring now bringing dramatic changes in its warsaw pact 
neighbors poland hungary the soviet union and east germany in 
reforming the economy we would like to intensify trade and 
cooperation with the west he asserted 
cooperation with the former arms producers could be of 
great interest to foreign partners because of the existing modern 
capacities and qualified personnel in the czechoslovak armament 
industry sumann said 
czechoslovak industry led by the skoda works of plzen 
producers of tanks and artillery has been considered a major 
arsenal of the soviet union and other pact nations 
despite a long industrial tradition the countrys economy is 
stagnating from overregulation overtaxation and overspending 
sumann said and one of the most important costcutting measures 
will be overall reduction of armament production 
he gave no figures on the planned cut 
sumann also said his country needs more democracy in public 
life but emphasized a gradual approach to reform by the 
hardline communist leadership 
the economic reform in czechoslovakia will be gradual he said 
we prefer a pragmatic stepbystep approach and are determined 
to avoid chaos in the transition he made no mention of 
privatizing the countrys many government industries

the state senate today took up a bill 
that could give pennsylvania the most restrictive abortion law in 
the country 
if the measure is passed and signed as expected by democratic 
gov robert casey pennsylvania could become the first state to 
take advantage of a us supreme court ruling in july allowing new 
curbs on abortion 
the house approved the measure 14358 last month the senate 
rules committee on monday endorsed the bill 115 without discussion 
sen james c greenwood a prochoice republican from suburban 
philadelphia noted that antiabortion forces held the votes to 
pass the bill and said as the debate got under way were about 
to cross an historic threshold 
pennsylvanias legislature has traditionally been strongly 
antiabortion 
before the senate session more than 100 antiabortion activists 
held a prayer vigil in the capitol rotunda outside several high 
school students from suburban philadelphia ripped open cardboad 
boxes and wrote slogans saying come help to do the right thing 
keep it legal vote prochoice 
we think this country was founded on choice and we need to 
have choice in this country said lisa bruno a high school 
senior 
a few steps away was an antiaborttion sign with a graphic 
picture of an aborted fetus an american flag and the words 
abortion babies suffer brutal pain 
pennsylvanias chapter of the national organization for women 
said it had delivered 50000 names on petitions and thousands of 
letters from prochoice advocates to the office of lt gov mark 
singel who presides over the senate 
the bill would require women to notify their husbands if they 
plan to get an abortion prohibit abortions because of the fetus 
sex ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except in cases 
where the mother faces death or irreversible harm and establish a 
24hour waiting period 
also the proposal would regulate the medical use of tissue from 
aborted fetuses and doctors would be required to inform a woman of 
the likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and 
explain the risks and alternatives 
an attempt by floridas gov bob martinez to take advantage of 
the us supreme court decision upholding a restrictive missouri 
abortion law fell flat last month when the legislature flatly 
rejected a package of bills 
in pennsylvania senators favoring a prochoice position have 
usually accounted for fewer than 20 votes in the 50member chamber 
sen roy wilt a prochoice republican said he would offer 
amendments calling for a referendum on the bill eliminating the 
requirement that husbands be notified and revising the waiting 
period so that women living 50 or more miles from a clinic would 
have to make only one trip 
because of a maze of procedural rules prochoice senators were 
expected to face a tough time getting the amendments even 
considered at least 26 members must first approve a motion to 
consider amendments before any can be offered 
around the capitol there was no sign of the swarms of 
protesters that gathered before the house vote senators said they 
received more calls than usual and mail on abortion was heavy

against the government today declared parts of the country 
liberated territory and a resident said rebels in a northern 
neighborhood advanced to new positions new casualty estimates put 
the number of dead at nearly 470 
the government rejected the rebels claims the situation is 
almost totally under control of the army said miguel salavarria 
el salvadors ambassador to the united states 
a rebel communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eight 
of the countrys 14 provinces it said peoples governments would 
be established in them 
at least 466 people have been killed in the fighting that has 
paralyzed the capital since saturday night when the leftist 
guerrillas mounted their largest offensive of the 10yearold civil 
war 
despite the government denials it was clear that rebels held 
parts of northern and eastern neighborhoods in san salvador 
controlling some from positions in tall buildings 
the armed forces declared a 24hour curfew today in seven 
neighborhoods saying it was because of the danger of snipers 
thousands of residents were trapped after combat intensified 
monday night between rebels and the government whose jets and 
helicopter gunships rocketed rebel positions in poor neighborhoods 
looting was reported in supermarkets in some poor neighborhoods 
rebel leaders in the occupied zones called on the armed forces 
to observe a brief ceasefire to allow residents to get food water 
and medical supplies an armed forces spokesman said he was not 
authorized to respond to the proposal 
as combat intensified hundreds of people fled the densely 
populated zacamil neighborhood a working class area residents 
said they feared the army would attack a photographer was unable 
to enter the zone because of the heavy fighting 
one zacamil resident said by telephone that the rebels were 
advancing and taking up new positions closer to military 
installations 
civilian casualties were high as government troops and rebels 
exchanged gunfire in densely populated districts 
along a wide arc on san salvadors northern fringe rebels 
installed themselves in homes and apartments and put snipers in 
church towers and tall buildings people in rebelheld areas said 
food and water were in short supply 
fighting intensified monday night in northeastern san salvador 
when rebels attacked the san benito national police batallion near 
the military headquarters 
we came down from the mountains and were going to stay 
here a guerrilla who identified himself only as porfirio said 
earlier monday were winning so far and we have their morale 
down 
he gestured with his ak47 assault rifle toward soldiers in the 
distance 
the combat is hard the boys guerrillas are in all the high 
buildings and control the movement of the soldiers said a rescue 
worker with the salvadoran red cross 
col raul arturo lopez a spokesman for the joint chiefs of 
staff said today that 309 guerrillas and 106 soldiers had died in

few of the citys 1 million people were on the streets monday 
and nearly all downtown stores were closed 
the us embassy said 1500 of the rebels estimated 7000 
regulars were fighting in the capital the government has 45000 
soldiers

reported as santa ana san miguel la paz usulutan chalatenango 
and san vicente the rebels launched the offensive with attacks on 
35 to 40 military outposts in the capital and provinces 
in san miguel 85 miles to the east a hospital employee said 
monday by telephone we have heard the fighting since saturday 
the guerrillas have occupied outlying neighborhoods and the people 
are discouraged without electricity and only some people dare to 
go out 
the rebels said the offensive was intended to pressure the 
rightist government into negotiating in good faith they suspended 
peace talks last week to protest the oct 31 bombing of a leftist 
union hall that killed 10 people blaming the government 
president alfredo cristiani on sunday announced a state of 
siege suspending free speech freedom of movement and the right to 
assemble he also imposed a dusttodawn curfew 
television stations broadcast their usual programs but were not 
allowed to transmit news 
cristiani who took office in june heads the nationalist 
republican alliance his party has been linked to death squads that 
operated with virtual impunity early in the war and are blamed for 
most of the 70000 deaths in the conflict most victims were 
civilians 
col rene ponce the armed forces chief of staff said monday 
night in a television address that government troops had 
encountered problems in neighborhoods around the capital 
he insisted however that there is no zone under their 
rebel control 
military planes fired rockets monday afternoon into the eastern 
neighborhoods of venecia and conacaste trying to drive out 
guerrillas some rockets struck homes killing several civilians 
and wounding others 
ponce however insisted the air force has not bombed anywhere 
in san salvador he said the men in uniform are working 24 
hours a day and soon we will gain control 
the rebels radio venceremos claimed every army attempt to 
reclaim rebel positions has turned into a profound bloodbath 
among their troops and elite corps they have lost whole companies 
producing a big demoralization in enemy ranks 
the insurgents said their presence in urban zones has begun to 
produce popular uprisings

national football league commissioner paul 
tagliabue assured a senate panel tuesday that the super bowl would 
not move to a payperview broadcast during the 1990s 
baseball commissioner fay vincent also before the senate 
judiciary subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business 
rights defended his sports decision to shift 175 games to cable 
television next year 
sen arlen specter rpa asked tagliabue for a flat 
commitment that fans would not be assessed a flat fee to view a 
broadcast of the super bowl such a payperview arrangement is 
used for some topdraw boxing matches 
for the balance of this century we do not foresee 
payperview for the super bowl game tagliabue said but 
couldnt predict beyond that 
lawmakers at the hearing repeatedly reminded the commissioners 
that their sports enjoy special antitrust law exemptions enabling 
them to behave differently than many other businesses 
as a new york sports fan i have suffered through the myriad 
of problems of the pending extinction of local sports coverage on 
free television rep charles schumer dny said in prepared 
testimony 
baseball shares a special compact with congress that provides 
it with a more sweeping antitrust exemption than any other sport 
enjoys if all the fan gets in exchange for this exemption is less 
baseball on tv then major league baseball is letting down its side 
of the agreement schumer said

a british tycoon who set a hotair balloon distance 
record two years ago despite crashing into the sea is about to try 
to break the record with a 6200mile flight across the pacific 
richard branson plans to lift off from southern japan possibly 
as early as this weekend with ballooning expert per lindstrand 
who was the pilot in the 1987 recordsetting flight over the 
atlantic if all goes well they will touch down four days later in 
california 
the weatherman is god on this venture branson said hes 
got a difficult equation to work out 
ideal weather would be no wind on takeoff 200 mph winds in the 
jet stream and no wind for the landing 
getting ready for a perilous flight is not all branson is doing 
in tokyo before the interview he met with transport ministry 
officials to seek more flights on his virgin atlantic airways new 
londontokyo route 
later he was visiting fujisankei communications group the 
japanese media company that recently bought a quarter of bransons 
virgin music group for 150 million 
the 39yearold branson dropped out of school at 15 to 
concentrate on business and is one of the richest men in britain 
his adventures which also include crossing the atlantic by 
speedboat are as much free advertising for his company as personal 
challenges 
none of his money will be needed for the pacific flight he 
said refusing to estimate the cost if sponsors hadnt been found 
for everything 
all my adventures of this kind ive done on the basis that it 
wouldnt cost us any money he said 
the balloon said to be the largest ever built is named virgin 
otsuka pacific flyer honoring otsuka pharmaceuticals which makes 
a popular health drink and is footing among other local costs the 
upkeep of 60 people at the launch site 
a pacific balloon crossing has been done only once in 1981 by 
three americans and a japanese with a helium balloon 
branson said he and lindstrand hope to take their balloon 
possibly as high as 40000 feet 
a balloon has never attempted this before to push our 
balloon into this very fast jet stream he said describing the 
planned ascent into winds up to 200 mph 
the top of the balloon might be going 150 mph and the bottom 
might be going only 50 mph as were going in well be clinging on 
for dear life as the top of the balloon heads off at great speed 
and hope we dont get left behind 
many weather balloons break up in the jet stream he said but 
they dont have his strong new fabric of metallic polyester film 
bonded to nylon 
other possible downsides bad weather breakdown of compressors 
that keep the gondolas air livable malfunction of the propane 
burners that provide the heat to keep the balloon aloft sudden 
decompression we have eight seconds to put on oxygen masks 
or some disaster that might force branson and lindstrand to skydive 
from altitudes where the temperature is as low as minus 58 
their training has included skydiving and physical conditioning 
to help ward off seasickness if they ditch at sea and have to wait 
to be rescued as happened in the 1987 atlantic trip 
at that time the 21storyhigh balloon briefly touched down in 
northern ireland and then flew out of control and splashed into the 
sea a mile of scotland both fliers were pulled from the water but 
they were credited with a distance record of 2280 miles from maine 
to the point of touchdown 
im confident we wont lose our lives branson said im 
absolutely convinced it can be done whether we will succeed in 
doing it the first time we wont know for two weeks but as with 
anything else we do in life if we fail the first time well be 
back again next year to make sure we finish the job off

zhivkov the ousted communist party chief 
zhivkov 78 resigned friday after 35 years of enforcing a 
rigid orthodox line in bulgaria he was succeeded by petar 
mladenov 53 who served 18 years as foreign minister and is 
considered more amenable to change 
konstantin tellalov chairman of the human rights commission 
told the associated press he actively seeks legal reforms to 
guarantee human rights independent activists however are 
suspicious of the commissions role 
before and after the human rights committee was set up about 1 
years ago unofficial groups have been established that criticize 
government policy on the environment human rights and labor some 
of their leaders accuse tellalovs commission of promoting 
government policy 
reports since friday have indicated extensive changes are 
imminent in the top ranks of the party and government and tellalov 
expressed hope that would help the work of his organization 
tellalov was ousted from the ruling politburo in the 1960s for 
being too outspoken it is said and afterward served as 
ambassador to canada and venezuela most recently he was bulgarian 
delegate to the un committee on disarmament in geneva 
he also said official media had been reluctant to publish or 
broadcast his appeals 
as an example tellalov said no publicity was given a 
resolution the commission adopted in july urging the government to 
determine who was responsible for bloody suppression of protests by 
ethnic turks two months earlier 
some 15 bulgarian journalists attended the news conference 
when we presented the resolution but it was not published 
anywhere he said 
at least seven people were killed in may when force was used 
against ethnic turks who protested an earlier campaign of force to 
make them adopt bulgarian names western diplomats later said up to 
30 people may have been killed 
tellalov said tuesday the commission resolution also called on 
the turks officially referred to as a moslem minority to 
reconsider leaving the country and asked turkey to treat the new 
arrivals well 
about 320000 of the 15 million bulgarian turks fled religious 
and cultural discrimination but nearly 60000 have returned 
because they could not find jobs or housing 
during the interview tuesday tellalov said his commission was 
pressing for constitutional changes to limit the death penalty 
which he said was included in 30 sections of the penal code 
when asked about the approximately 200 political prisoners 
reported held in bulgaria he acknowledged it was realitvely easy 
to be convicted of a political crime 
members of his commission had been allowed to visit eight 
political prisoners in sofia tellalov said 
he criticized failure to make the constitution conform with 
international covenants on human rights signed by bulgaria a 
commission for that purpose led by zhivkov was established in 
1988 but has never met tellalov said

toyota motor corp is deciding whether to pull 
its employees out of china after some said they were targets of 
gunshots and a death threat a spokesman for the japanese automaker 
and other sources said tuesday 
three toyota employees believe they were shot at while playing 
golf in beijing on sunday three days after toyotas beijing office 
received an anonymous death threat japanese sources in beijing 
said on condition of anonymity 
a letter received by the office thursday contained a bullet and 
ordered japanese businessmen to leave china or face death they 
said 
we are taking the letter fairly seriously said a toyota 
spokesman in tokyo who would not disclose the letters contents 
we are currently working on details of whether to pull our people 
out to japan 
the japanese sources quoted the letter as saying now that the 
martial law troops are gone our time has come go back to japan 
from now we will kill you japanese 
soldiers with automatic rifles were deployed on beijing streets 
under martial law after the armys crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in early june but were removed nov 1 only a few armed 
police stand guard in beijing primarily at tiananmen square 
the japanese embassy in beijing has asked the chinese ministry 
of public security and the foreign ministry to investigate the 
letter and the reported gunshots a japanese diplomat said 
about 170 golfers mostly japanese were on the course just 
before lunchtime when some of them heard what sounded like bullets 
whizzing by said the diplomat who refused to be further 
identified 
witnesses however reported hearing two bursts of machinegun 
fire and believed 2030 shots were fired other japanese sources 
said 
some of the bullets hit trees on the beijing golf club near the 
golfers the sources said 
the golf course is slightly more than a mile from a shooting 
range where people can rent hand guns rifles and machine guns for 
target practice 
three toyota employees heard the shots which were believed to 
be stray shots from the rifle range the toyota spokesman in tokyo 
said 
there was no feeling of threat to their lives but they felt 
uneasy and left the course immediately he said 
in july and august letters sent to japanese firms including 
japan airlines and signed by the bloodbright dare to die 
squad threatened to kill japanese for their economic 
invasion of china 
japan has a large trade surplus with china and tourists from 
japan are a major source of foreign capital after last summers 
threats security was increased at japanese offices and hotels that 
are home to many japanese businessmen 
chinese premier li peng said tuesday before he left for a visit 
to pakistan bangladesh and nepal that the shooting was merely an 
accident and that authorities are investigating 
such an event could occur in any other country and i want to 
say that in china there will be no greater number of such incidents 
than in any other country li said 
li said he doubted the incidents would affect investment from 
overseas 
just recently when i received an economic delegation from 
japan that japanese delegation was very optimistic about making 
investments in china and about carrying out economic and 
technological cooperation with japan li said 
foreign businessmen have expressed concern over the political 
and investment climate in china

voters decided two bitter city commission races 
tuesday with the only elected black on the commission locked in a 
tough reelection battle 
dade county elections officials expected 36 percent of the 
registered voters to turn out for the runoff elections 
twoterm incumbent miller dawkins 64 said he didnt believe 
his was the black seat but he also said the citys blacks 
with about 30 percent of the voters deserved representation on 
the commission 
he was challenged by joe carollo 34 a cubanborn former 
commissioner whose spanishlanguage ads suggested all the cubans 
vote for carollo 
in the other race former commissioner rosario kennedy 44 
trying to regain the seat she resigned this summer for an 
unsuccessful run at congress faced miriam alonso 48

dawkins an administrator at miamidade community college led a 
sixcandidate primary nov 7 by 691 votes over carollo black 
seat in jeopardy was the frontpage headline in the miami times 
a blackoriented weekly newspaper 
dawkins was supported by some hispanic leaders who said it was 
important symbolically to have at least one black on the commission 
carollo a former police officer who served two terms on the 
commission before losing the 1987 election ran a slashing campaign 
that linked dawkins with a drug trafficker and called him the worst 
commissioner in miami history in his fiery years on the 
commission carollo often brought his anticommunism into 
commission debates 
some key cubanamerican leaders had backed cubanborn attorney 
victor de yurre in his 1987 defeat of carollo 
mayor xavier suarez easily reelected last week to a new four 
yearterm called carollo disruptive and supported dawkins 
de yurre and anglo jl plummer will be up for reelection 
in two years the mayor also sits on the commission 
ms kennedy charged ms alonso with a penchant for 
demagoguery her commercials called ms alonso an opportunist 
who does not respect the law a reference to a 1988 court 
decision that knocked ms alonso off the dade county commission 
ballot because of a residency violation 
ms alonso a little havana populist concentrated her campaign 
among hispanic voters she led the sixcandidate primary by 235 
votes

one of the astronauts who will fly 
a satellite retrieval mission at christmastime said tuesday that if 
the crew doesnt snag the bussize target it will mean a great loss 
to science as well as a blow to us prestige 
if we dont get ldef back theres absolutely no science from 
that mission said g david low its a completely passive 
satellite and no data has been transmitted to earth so its a 
complete loss of that mission if we dont get it back 
ldef is an 11ton 30footlong payload of experiments placed in 
orbit by another shuttle crew in 1984 it was to have been 
retrieved a year later but schedule changes and the 1986 
challenger explosion delayed a rescue mission 
now with ldef expected to crash back into earths atmosphere in 
february a fiveperson crew is to fly the space shuttle columbia 
in pursuit of the huge satellite with liftoff scheduled for dec 
18 
they will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space a 
secret defense department mission to be flown by a fiveman 
discovery crew is scheduled to lift off thanksgiving eve nov 22 
nasa announced the new date earlier tuesday the launch was delayed 
two days because of potential wiring problems in electronic control 
units on discoverys solid fuel booster rockets 
we hope that even though well be gone from our families and 
loved ones for christmas that well be able to bring back a great 
big christmas present for all the scientists that are working on 
the ldef said astronaut dan brandenstein who will command 
columbia 
i think it looks pretty bad for the united states to allow 
something like that to come in and reenter low said its big 
enough and its massive enough that there are pieces that would 
survive reentry and you always take a chance of hitting something 
or doing some damage to something 
he said that the chances of ldef chunks hitting anything are 
very remote because it flies mostly over oceans but i think its 
poor form to let something like that come back 
brandenstein low and their crewmates held a news conference and 
individual interviews tuesday to discuss their 10day mission that 
will have them orbiting the earth on christmas 
the other columbia crew members are pilot jim wetherbee and 
mission specialists bonnie dunbar and marsha ivins 
they will deploy a navy communications satellite before 
brandenstein and wetherbee begin a complex set of maneuvers to 
track down ldef which dunbar is to grab on the fourth day of the 
flight by reaching out with a 60foot robot arm pulling it into 
the cargo bay 
the satellite is crammed with 57 science technology and 
materials experiments which more than 200 scientists have been 
waiting to examine for nearly six years they mainly want to know 
how various materials have withstood the long exposure to the space 
environment information that will help in designing permanent 
space stations and other longterm spacecraft such as those planned 
for a spacebased missile defense system 
the vehicle is invaluable to us said the missions flight 
director al pennington almost every material known has been 
sitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen and 
other space materials for six years

czechs won a concession from their 
hardline communist leadership tuesday with the government saying 
they would no longer need exit visas to travel to the west 
premier ladislav adamec said his government regards tourism as 
the citizens important right to get to know the world gain 
experience and establish personal contacts 
his announcement came five days after neighboring east germany 
threw open its borders to allow citizens to travel freely to the 
west for the first time in nearly three decades millions have 
taken advantage of the new freedom 
hungary and poland which have been at the forefront of east 
bloc reforms also allow their citizens to travel freely to the 
west 
adamec did not say when the new regulations would take effect 
but government sources insisting on anonymity said it would be jan 
1 
the processing of travel documents is being speeded up 
adamec told the federal assembly or parliament for travel to 
nonsocialist countries and to yugoslavia exit visas will not be 
necessary 
czechoslovak citizens previously wishing to travel to the west 
had to obtain a passport and then apply for exit visas with 
interior ministry authorities this process requires stamps of 
approval from local communist party branches employers and the 
army and takes up to 30 days 
under the new rules those wishing to travel to the west still 
must apply for visas from the western country they wish to visit 
yugoslavia does not require visas from czechoslovak citizens 
the yugoslav adriatic coast is a favorite summer travel spot for 
czechs travel to other east bloc countries is visafree except for 
poland and the soviet union 
president bush praised adamecs announcement 
the people of czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for 
freedom that others have and i would expect wed see further 
changes there just as we have seen in poland hungary and in east 
germany bush said so its a very good and encouraging step 
czechoslovakia has been among the most resistant countries in 
the soviet bloc to political reforms and has cracked down on 
dissent but it has gradually allowed its citizens greater freedom 
to travel 
in the past two years prague has allowed thousands of 
czechoslovaks to vacation in the west in the summer months cars 
with czech license plates are a common sight on austrian and west 
german highways 
the number of visits by czechoslovak citizens to the west 
increased last year by 30 percent over the previous year adamec 
said the government will take steps to remove unnecessary red tape 
to make travel easier he said 
our aim is that czechoslovakia become a country for which 
travel and tourism represent not only a significant sum in the 
state budget but also the satisfaction of its citizens he said 
in the nationally televised speech 
two years ago czechoslovakia relaxed hard currency restrictions 
permitting its 155 million citizens to keep foreign currency 
earmarked for travel abroad in their bank accounts and withdraw it 
without a special application the move eased travel abroad 
czechoslovaks must prove they have the necessary hard currency 
for travel to the west either in an account or a guarantee for 
expenses from a host abroad 
adamec did not say anything about these currency stipulations 
and it was unclear whether they would continue to be in effect 
after the exit visa regulation is lifted 
in july the government further eased travel restrictions 
recognizing required invitations from abroad from anyone living in 
the west including emigres who left the country illegally 
previously the invitations had to come from family 
the government also lifted restrictions on czechoslovaks wishing 
to emigrate abroad to join family members who left their country 
illegally 
despite the travel liberalizations however authorities often 
have prevented prominent dissidents from traveling by confiscating 
their passports

president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday praised 
the dramatic reforms in eastern europe for opening opportunities 
for human contact but he said no one should claim a victory in the 
cold war 
with a week of dramatic developments in east germany bulgaria 
and czechoslovakia behind them gorbachev met with french foreign 
minister roland dumas and made his most detailed remarks about the 
changes 
they are extremely different in their starting conditions 
economic possibilities in their level of political culture and 
historical heritage tass paraphrased gorbachev as saying of the 
east european countries involved he did not name them adding 
but they have a common direction which fosters the building of a 
european home for it makes the countries closer more open and 
creates new opportunities for human contact and an equal exchange 
at the same time the kremlin chief told dumas it was useless 
to shout about a victory in the cold war about the collapse of 
this or that social system he said a realistic analysis of 
changes and work toward a balance of interests should replace 
such claims 
in an earlier meeting soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and his french counterpart clashed over whether

the three leaders of a radical 
sinhalese group that has waged a violent campaign to overthrow the 
government were captured and killed this week the government said 
tuesday 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne also said six of the groups 
seven politburo members have been killed 
upatissa gamanayake secondincommand of the ultranationalist 
peoples liberation front was shot to death monday night when he 
tried to escape wijeratne said 
gamanayake 36 was regarded as heir apparent to the fronts 
founding leader rohana wijeweera who was reportedly killed sunday 
along with his no 3 man 
a former front leader predicted the group formed 22 years ago 
would disintegrate 
the foreign minister said gamanayake was captured on information 
provided by wijeweera and was taking interrogators to a front 
hideout when he tried to jump out of the vehicle soldiers shot and 
killed him wijeratne said 
wijeweera was captured sunday in the central kandy hill district 
and brought to colombo where he was killed wijeratne announced 
monday he said the fronts thirdincommand hb herath was 
killed at the same time 
the official said both were killed when wijeweera was bringing 
authorities to the fronts headquarters in colombo he said herath 
pulled a pistol and shot at his colleague and that security forces 
then shot and killed both men 
wijeratne refused to identify the one politburo member who has 
not been killed saying only that he is at large 
the peoples liberation front began a terror campaign in august 
1987 to protest the governments signing of an accord intended to 
end a war by tamil rebels the front said the accord granted too 
many concessions to tamils who comprise about 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people 
it accused the sinhalesecontrolled government of selling out 
its own people and threatened to kill all who supported the accord 
more than 6000 people have been killed the past years the 
government initially blamed the front for most of the killings but 
when charred bodies of young sinhalese men started turning up along 
roadsides officials said progovernment vigilante squads were 
slaying suspected front members 
human rights activists opposition politicians and front 
supporters also accused government security forces of killing some 
suspected front supporters 
victor ivan a former front leader predicted the front would 
disintegrate with the deaths of wijeweera and his chief aides 
ivan was jailed after leading the fronts unsuccessful uprising 
against the government in 1971 released with other front members 
during a general pardon in 1977 he now edits an independent 
political magazine 
the peoples liberation front was founded in 1967 by wijeweera 
an avowed marxist 
it tried to overthrow the government of prime minister sirimavo 
bandaranaike in 1971 but the uprising was put down and at least 
20000 people killed 
the front later dabbled in mainstream politics then went 
underground before emerging again as a major force in 1987

a convicted drug dealer who says he has sent 
30 to 40 former colleagues to prison since turning states evidence 
told a house panel tuesday the only effective way to combat cocaine 
trade is to destroy the central american coca crop 
cut off the snakes head and the snake will die said mr 
witness as he was addressed by a number of congressmen 
accompanied by a trio of federal marshals the witness identity 
was protected by a hood over his head and an electronic device that 
distorted his voice 
go after the crop or the chemicals that process the coca he 
said i dont think anything else will do any good 
he said stepped up enforcement efforts is forcing cartel 
leaders to move it is forcing them to spend money but it is not 
stopping them though he said the common man in colombia no 
longer supports them 
he said there would be wide local support for destroying the 
coca crops in colombia and neighboring countries if the united 
states provided adequate economic support to reimburse the peasant 
growers who would lose their main source of income 
the witness a us native said he got into the drug business 
as an outgrowth of arrangements he made to get his colombianborn 
wife and her family into the united states illegally 
he told the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision 
regulation and insurance that he never personally laundered drug 
money and had little first hand knowledge that might help the panel 
draft new legislation to curb the conversion of illictly obtained 
money into legitimate accounts 
moreover he disagreed with the assessment of several committee 
members that the most effective way to attack international drug 
cartels is to trace the money flow to them 
though the witness was miscast as an authority on the parts of 
drug law within the subcommittees jurisdiction the panel members 
eagerly peppered him with questions about the drug trade in general 
he said he was among fourtosix major cocaine importers in 
the miami area before he was arrested in 1985 he has been in the 
federal witness protection program since being released from prison 
in 1987 and has testified in a number of trials 
rep frank annunzio dill the house banking subcommittee 
chairman introduced the mystery witnesses as a man who had 
smuggled 56 tons of cocaine into the miami areas and said he has 
enough information to personally lead to the convictions of several 
major drug lords being sought for extradition to the united states 
annunzio said he plans to closely question internal revenue 
service agents and other federal enforcement officials in 
subsequent hearings about the apparent ease with which drug dealers 
circumvent existing laws drafted to curb money laundering 
adherence to the letter of the law is not enough said 
annunzio bankers must take one step more and actively seek to 
uncover the suspicious and shady transaction and then report it 
the mystery witness said he had been told by former associates 
who handled that end of the business that it was relatively easy to 
accomplish 
the money launderers that was their speciality he said 
adding that the specialists would approach bankers wine and dine 
them and make them an offer 
so far as taking cash to foreign banks the witness said he 
sometimes did that himself and that the procedure was very simple 
id put it in a suitcase get on a plane and leave he said 
would a death penalty have deterred him from dealing drugs 
asked the subcommittee staff director 
yes i would say it would have responded the witness after 
pausing for several seconds to stare through his mask at the 
ceiling high above i would not have gotten into the business i 
would run from them at the beginning 
he had said earlier that once in he had no choice i tried on 
several occasions to retire and i was told the only way out was a 
cemetery or a jail he said

a democratic congresswoman on tuesday called 
on president bush to withdraw all us troops from western europe 
claiming the days in which the warsaw pact nations marched to the 
beat of a soviet drummer are over 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed 
services committee said in a twopage letter to bush that the 
rusting and crumbling of the iron curtain provides an 
unprecedented opportunity to foster democracy and reduce the budget 
deficit by removing american combat troops from europe 
schroeder suggested that bush seize the initiative at his dec 
23 summit meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 
the mediterranean near malta 
what you should propose is this an immediate withdrawal of 
all us combat troops from western europe in exchange for a 
withdrawal of all soviet combat troops from eastern europe 
schroeder said 
bush proposed at the 40th anniversary of the nato alliance in 
may a ceiling of 275000 on us and soviet ground and air force 
personnel which would require a reduction of about 30000 us 
troops and about 325000 soviet troops 
but schroeder said the dramatic turn of events in eastern europe 
in the past few weeks makes it clear that the days during which 
the kremlin could count on the arms of poland the german 
democratic republic and hungary to march to the beat of a soviet 
drummer are over

holiday turkeys will cost less but hams will 
be more expensive the agriculture department said tuesday 
consumers will find adequate supplies of turkey and ham for 
the holiday season the departments economic research service 
reported prices likely will be lower for turkeys but higher for 
hams than last year 
turkey production in the fourth quarter may be up about 12 
percent from a year ago with frozen inventories up slightly ham 
supplies are expected to decline slightly despite an increase in 
cold storage stocks 
total red meat and poultry production is expected to set a 
record in 1989 and again in 1990 the report said among the 
major components only beef production may decline in 1989 
reflecting the reduced cattle inventory 
looking to 1990 the report said beef production may increase 
somewhat because of more cattle going into feedlots before 
slaughter resulting in more fed beef 
in both years pork output could remain relatively large 
the report said broiler output will continue to grow because 
of improved profits in recent years turkey production also is 
expected to grow but at a lower rate than broilers because returns 
are being squeezed

shimmering gold mesh dress to get the wellheeled to give money to 
those who can barely afford their next meal much less a pair of 
shoes 
wednesdays fashion show will benefit the massachusetts 
coalition for the homeless a statewide group that does everything 
from lobby for the homeless to refinish furniture for people moving 
out of shelters 
the coalition says between 5000 and 8000 people inhabit 
bostons streets and shelters 
after the benefit michel roux the president of the company 
that distributes absolut vodka which owns the golden dress plans 
to take the 532000 garment on the road for similar fundraisers 
i dont think we have to look at it from the angle of gold 
roux said i think we have to look at it from the angle of the 
novelty the uniqueness of the dress which will certainly bring 
attention to the cause 
model rachel williams will be draped in the 8pound 18karat 
gold dress designed by anthony ferrara during the show at a boston 
nightclub the models for boston benefit for the homeless hope to 
raise 40000 from the show said craig sutton a spokesman for the 
event 
the group will give 100 percent of the proceeds to homeless 
causes sutton said adding that absolut and the models 
organization will cover costs of the evening 
roux got the idea of featuring the dress a clingy short tank 
after he spotted ferrara wearing a gold mesh scarf ferrara designs 
for such stars as cher and barbra streisand 
roux keeps the dress in a safe you roll it in paper and keep 
it like you keep any jewelry he said 
the show also features a warmup act a sterling silver dress 
valued at 100000 also owned by absolut 
fundraisers say they recognize that the glitz and glamour of a 
fashion show seems at odds with the hard reality of homelessness 
but sandra blevins a model who helped create the idea three years 
ago said people in the fashion industry have an obligation to 
contribute to the cause 
it looks a little strange from the outside but it really makes 
sense everybody should get involved said blevins who has done 
volunteer work at local homeless shelters we make money off of 
people who are welldressed 
meryl langbort of the massachusetts coalition for the homeless 
said her group welcomes the chance to reach people who might not 
otherwise think about the homeless 
certainly the money is important certainly we need it to 
operate but whats so important about something like this is it 
gets the message out there she said 
admission is 40 which pays for food but not drinks 
the mesh for the dress was made by a massachusetts firm that 
specializes in metal wear for less fashionable garb outerwear for 
meatpackers 
whiting amp davis makes a stainless steel ring mesh that protects 
workers from knife wounds earlier in the century the company 
which started out as a jewelry firm created a line of small gold 
mesh handbags

premierdesignate salim hoss began 
parliamentary consultations to form a new government tuesday and 
some christian lawmakers appeared willing to defy gen michel aoun 
and work with the moslem leader 
rival shiite moslem militiamen clashed with machine guns and 
rocketpropelled grenades in beiruts southern slums three 
militiamen were reported wounded 
aoun the christian army leader told reporters any national 
unity government would be a crime against lebanons sovereignty 
and anyone taking part in it will be a criminal 
nevertheless four maronite parliament deputies held a meeting 
to consider an offer from hoss to join his government which will 
institute reforms intended to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
they included george saadeh leader of the rightwing phalange 
party the largest political force in the christian enclave 
controlled by aouns troops 
the general wasnt able to push a single syrian soldier an 
inch backward in his socalled liberation war said deputy butros 
harb another who participated in the meeting why doesnt the 
general give peace a chance 
aoun in march declared a war of liberation to drive the 
40000 syrian troops from lebanon where they were deployed in 1976 
under a mandate to quell the civil war aoun said they abrogated 
the mandate by siding with the moslems 
the violence ended with an arab leaguebrokered ceasefire in 
september and last month lebanese legislators meeting in taif 
saudi arabia approved a peace accord clearing the way for election 
of a president and creation of a national reconciliation government 
newly elected president rene mouawad on monday named hoss prime 
minister to form the government hoss remains prime 
ministerdesignate until he forms a government endorsed by 
presidential decree 
aoun has said any christian politicians who join hoss 
government will be banned from the christian enclave 
he pledged to block implementation of the peace accord because 
it does not include a timetable for the withdrawal of syrian troops 
saadeh has challenged aoun to a televised debate over the accord 
at his news conference aoun rejected the proposed debate 
saying there is no need for any dialogue over the taif accord i 
shall not allow it to pass 
no civilian casualties were reported from the onehour flareup 
between the proiranian hezbollah and the syrianbacked amal 
militias but hezbollah sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said three combatants from both sides were wounded 
the two factions have long been vying for control of the 12 
million shiites who make up the largest sect among lebanons 4 
million people 
an amal spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
command of a syrian army contingent in charge of the security of 
beiruts moslem sector intervened with the leaderships of the two 
groups to stop the violence

the moment was solemn but not so much so that 
lech walesa a twinkle in his eye could not make a joke one 
especially appreciated by the beefiest of the labor leaders in his 
audience 
walesa addressing the aflcio recalled dark days when as a 
shipyard electrician he organized the strike that would lead nine 
years later to the first noncommunist government in the soviet 
bloc 
when in august 1980 i jumped over the wall surrounding the 
gdansk shipyard i did not know what our protests would lead to 
but i knew perfectly well what it was that we had to do he said 
now he said he wished that only such clearcut situations 
confronted him and with a selfeffacing grin he took note of the 
pot belly that had come with the years 
maybe today he said i would have slightly more 
difficulty jumping over that wall 
many a hefty union leader laughed with him 
walesa gave a bearhug to brother kirkland lane kirkland 
president of the federation and a moraleboosting salute tuesday 
to a labor movement that has seen its own role diminish and has had 
no recent success to emulate what walesa had achieved in poland 
when he made his way through the hotel ballroom grasping at 
hands beaming with pleasure the union chiefs cheered for 15 
minutes 
lech lech lech lech a teamster chanted 
garment workers jumped on chairs to snap his picture 
steelworkers raised their hands in the vsign walesas fellow 
electricians clapped in unison a paperworker wearing a 
solidarnosc button held aloft a red sign that in polish 
denounced frank lorenzo president of strikebound eastern airlines 
he vsigned them back and bowed at them beaming 
pinkcheeked his famous mustache trimmed and gray walesa said 
he did not want to appear to be currying their favor but he thanked 
the aflcio over and over for standing beside the cause so many 
people considered lost and which now thanks to the stubbornness of 
poles and the perseverance of our friends has put us on the road 
to victory 
in martiallaw poland in the days when walesa was often under 
arrest the aflcio quietly delivered millions of dollars to his 
underground movement and smuggled in printing presses to let 
solidaritys voice be heard 
you have proven to be our most steadfast allies in the trade 
union struggle for human rights he said 
a vast movement for democracy and freedom is developing in my 
country it is changing the political face of poland and of the 
world and that movement has been made possible only through the 
peaceful struggle of working people of trade unionists like you 
and me like us

the town of plymouth has taken a step 
backward in communication history by hiring stanley p meldrum as 
town crier 
in the days before television before radio and even before 
daily newspapers events of the day were shouted from the town 
square by the town crier meldrums job will be to don pilgrim garb 
for special occasions and stroll the plymouth waterfront shouting 
hear ye hear ye and describing the days events 
meldrum 72 who has had plenty of practice meeting the public 
by playing santa claus for the past eight years was awarded the 
unpaid post after a town selectman saw him acting as a pilgrim for 
a september safety first event and was entranced by his 
performance 
a town crier was then proposed and the selectmen went for the 
idea as long as they didnt have to pay for it meldrum said 
tuesday 
provincetown also had a town crier post until the man who held 
the position was fired for allegedly insulting gays 
meldrum a plymouth resident for 12 years took some 
publicspeaking courses during a stint in the armed forces and is 
now retired from a career in hotel management and retail he 
already has purchased his own official town crier pilgrim uniform 
one drawback to the post i guess that makes me a 
politician he said mournfully

if its true that the appearance of a 
house says a lot about its inhabitants then city officials believe 
george zysks house says too much 
zysk 73 has plastered the front of his twostory home with 
about 50 handpainted wooden signs expressing his opinions on city 
issues ranging from traffic to taxes 
city officials want the signs taken down 
ill go to jail but im not taking them down zysk said 
adding that the city is trying to stifle his freedom of speech 
most of the 2footby3foot signs complain about the citys 
leadership and specific projects like the proposed expansion of 
the local airport 
whenever i thought something was unfair i tried to let the 
people riding by know it said zysk who also is known for 
expressing his dissatisfaction at city council meetings and in 
letters to the editor most of the signs went up during the last 
year 
clean out city hall sweep out dictators nov 7 reads one 
of his crudely produced preelection signs that remain up 
last wednesday one day after voters elected a new mayor for the 
first time in eight years city officials decided theyd seen 
enough 
he was notified he was in violation of the citys sign ordinance 
and given until monday to remove the signs because he hasnt 
complied officials said tuesday they intend to take action 
you can put a for sale sign in front of your house and we 
certainly wouldnt take issue with that or a decorative sign or one 
with a pleasant message said chuck nowak a building inspector 
with the citys department of environmental and transportation 
services 
but one of his signs has a revolver on it and says dont 
beware of the dog beware of smith amp wesson and theyve gotten 
progressively worse nowak said of a drawing on one sign 
violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor with the penalty set 
by a district court city officials said the case has gone to the 
city attorney though no decision about prosecution has been made 
nowak said the city has received several complaints about zysks 
signs primarily from passing motorists on the welltraveled 
residential street 
but a neighbor doesnt seem to mind 
im a firm believer in live and let live as long as he doesnt 
hurt anybody said wayne boes who lives next door hes a good 
neighbor and hes good to me and doesnt bother me a bit

the three national public television 
organizations announced tuesday an agreement designed to enhance 
their coordination and improve program scheduling and quality 
the pact involving the corporation for public broadcasting the 
public broadcasting service and the national association of public 
television stations will free public television from many of the 
frustrations of the past and give it a jump start for the next 
decade according to cpb president donald ledwig 
the agreement in principle which now must be approved by the 
organizations respective boards as well as congress would make 
cpb primarily responsible for developing new programs while pbs 
would focus on distribution funding for existing programs and 
support of local stations 
public television in the united states is now a complex 
decentralized system with multiple sources of programming and 
financing as a consequence producers spend much of their time 
scrambling for money and development of a national program 
schedule is at best difficult 
congress in the public telecommunications act of 1988 directed 
cpb and pbs to examine whether they could pool their resources with 
those of local public television stations to improve national 
programming the agreement announced tuesday is the outgrowth of 
that mandate 
pbs president bruce christensen called the tentative threeyear 
agreement both a centralization and a consensusbuilding plan as 
a result it will make the programming process more agile and 
responsive to a quickly changing television environment 
currently about 262 million less than half of which is tax 
money is spent annually by public television for national 
programming the agreement calls for pbs to directly manage 100 
million of that amount the cpb would handle the rest 
concentrating on the development of new programs financing of the 
new independent television service and minority productions 
pbs will expand the powers of its new program executive 
jennifer lawson under the agreement she will be charged with 
developing a multiyear schedule and financing plan in coordination 
with a new 17member program policy committee drawing together 
representatives of producers minorities and stations in each 
region of the country 
david j brugger president of the stations association said 
the deal gives public television the opportunity to move forward 
in developing the strongest possible national programming with the 
funds available

president bush met tuesday with four 
republican members of congress who support abortion rights but his 
spokesman said his own antiabortion views are not subject to 
change 
the president met with reps lynn martin of illinois claudine 
schneider of rhode island nancy johnson of connecticut and olympia 
snowe of maine 
bush also plans to speak at fundraising event next monday for 
both martin and schneider 
abortion is not a test of support no matter what ones 
position is spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the president supports all republicans fitzwater said he 
supports republican candidates without regard to specific positions 
that differ from him 
afterward snowe said she and the other participants expressed 
their views but gained no commitment from bush 
snowe said the republicans did not expect bush to reverse 
himself on abortion but hoped there could be some gradations in 
his position in the future such as allowing federally funded 
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest 
we certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about thhe more 
than one 
million items are displayed at the museum of the american indian in 
upper manhattan ny the bulk of the collection is stored in a 
bronx ny warehouse 
roland force director of the museum of the american indian 
called the vote something we can all rejoice in 
its important to indians its important to the smithsonian 
and its important to this nation and how can you do anything 
better than that he said in a telephone interview from new york 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo the bills house sponsor 
said he hoped groundbreaking in washington could occur by 1992 a 
date he called meaningful because it would be the 500th anniversary 
of columbus landfall in the new world 
smithsonian spokeswoman madeleine jacobs agreed that date was 
realistic 
campbell also said president bush would sign the bill monday or 
tuesday at a ceremony on the new museums site between the 
national air and space museum and the capitol 
the legislation transfers the heye collection to the 
smithsonian which already has a significant collection of indian 
artifacts it authorizes 10 million in 1990 for the planning 
design and construction of the national museum and for the care 
and custody of the heye collection 
it also mandates that the smithsonian establish a satellite 
indian museum in the old custom house in lower manhattan and build 
storage space for the artifacts at its museum support center in 
suitland md 
the costs of building the new museum and the two other 
facilities have been estimated at 175 million 
converting the custom house is expected to cost 24 million 
with new york city and new york state to pay onethird each 
in addition the legislation stipulates that the smithsonian 
where possible return its collection of some 18000 indian remains 
and funerary objects to their original tribes for burial the 
legislation authorizes more than 12 million in 1991 for the 
smithsonian to inventory and repatriate the remains 
disposition of the remains had been the last obstacle to a 
successful bill compromise came in september when smithsonian 
secretary robert mccormick adams himself an anthropologist 
reversed the museums longheld policy that the bones were 
necessary for study indians nationwide seeking to bury their 
ancestors heralded his decision as a watershed that will influence 
other museums

new packaging techniques coupled with consumer 
demands for fresh chemicalfree foods are challenging producers to 
develop better ways of ensuring safety and informing the public 
food industry experts say 
new safety measures and an upfront approach to consumers 
concerns have to go hand in hand with the development of new 
products according to officials who spoke on food safety issues of 
the 1990s at the food amp dairy expo which began saturday and ends 
wednesday 
consumers now want fresher foods said david henning 
director of quality assurance for suburban skokiebased kraft 
general foods a division of philip morris cos inc of new york 
theyre not as anxious to have food with preservatives that in 
the past controlled organisms so were going to have to have other 
methods to ensure safety 
the perceived health value of fresh and refrigerated products 
presents a dilemma to the food industry said alan hugunin senior 
director of product technologies of the national food processors 
association 
whereas you can put something in a can and be sure that no 
microorganisms are going to grow in there for eternity you cant 
do that with fresh and refrigerated products hugunin said 
and better methods of packaging foods create their own 
challenges 
new packaging methods can prevent mold longer leaving food 
looking wholesome even while it grows unnoticeable organisms that 
cause food poisoning he said 
in response food manufacturers are increasingly using a system 
developed in the us space program of analyzing the production 
process at each step from the raw material to a finished product 
according to henning 
the method allows food producers to prevent problems before they 
occur rather than testing food after its been produced and if 
there is a problem tracing it back to find the source he said 
this stepbystep method is the best answer anybodys come up 
with yet to ensure food safety joseph hotchkiss an associate 
professor of food chemistry and toxicology at cornell university 
said during a telephone interview tuesday 
but consumers seem unaware that their demands for new fresher 
foods are pushing the industry to deal with new problems involving 
contamination by microorganisms instead hotchkiss said they are 
more concerned with food additives and pesticides which are a 
smaller problem 
the consumer by any objective measure does not have the same 
priorities as the scientific community on food safety hotchkiss 
said 
hugunin said the food industry has to do a better job of 
educating the public about pesticides and additives such as the 
chemical alar a suspected cancercausing chemical 
an early 1989 report on alartreated apples by the private 
national resources defense council prompted an uproar over its use 
although government and apple industry officials said the chemical 
is only used on a small percentage of apples and is not dangerous 
in the levels used 
the apple industry was caught unprepared hugunin said 
the information which was needed to respond to some of these 
claims was just spread out all over and there was no good way 
of pulling it all together quickly to respond to some of the 
statements that were made hugunin said 
as food products continue to develop and safety techniques 
change the industry has to educate consumers before concerns grow 
he said 
the expo is sponsored by the dairy amp food industries supply 
association of rockville md

president bush on thursday criticized the 
leftist rebels of el salvador for senseless bloodshed in the 
allout offensive that has crippled the capital of the central 
american nation 
he also renewed a charge that the leftist sandinista government 
of nicaragua is continuing to arm the salvadoran guerrillas the 
faribundo marti national liberation front 
in remarks to ministers of the organization of american states 
meeting here bush said he wanted to relay how upset i am that at 
a time when were all trying to build peace in central america 
through diplomatic means the fmln in el salvador aided and 
abetted by nicaragua and the cuban government has resorted to 
senseless bloodshed and gross violations of all the agreements 
reached to promote peace in central america 
bush made a pitch for the democracies that are members of the 
oas to pressure nicaragua to stop aiding the fmln 
as democrats we ought to be supporting the concept of 
stopping these weapons going in there he said 
the rebels mounted their largest offensive of el salvadors 
10year civil war saturday night with the death count so far at 
466 people as residents were trapped by combat and government 
aircraft struck at rebel positions 
despite government denials rebels clearly held parts of 
northern and eastern neighborhoods in san salvador and a rebel 
communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eight of the 
countrys 14 provinces 
in his remarks to the oas luncheon bush said he wanted to 
assure the countries of the hemisphere that despite the ballyhoo 
over reform moves in eastern europe and his upcoming summit meeting 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev he doesnt want the latin 
nations to think that beacause were paying a lot of attention to 
the change thats taking place there trying to figure out how we 
can facilitate the change that that means a lack of interest in 
the western hemisphere 
i am delighted with the new moves toward democracy in eastern 
europe bush said despite the excitement were not going to 
neglect this hemisphere were building the worlds first 
democratic hemisphere

federal officials are considering an interim 
appointment at the food and drug administration while they search 
for a permanent commissioner to replace frank young who has 
resigned sources said tuesday 
unlike the current and previous fda commissioners who were 
appointed by the head of the department of health and human 
services the next commissioner will be a presidential appointment 
and will require senate confirmation 
the change in procedure means it likely will to take longer to 
put a permanent commissioner at the helm of the agency whose 
responsibility is to assure the safety of drugs cosmetics and most 
food products 
the pace of presidential appointments during the bush 
administration has been slow at hhs several key agencies still 
have no permanent head including the health care financing 
administration the family support administration and the national 
institutes of health 
the fda has been plagued recently by disclosures of bribery and 
corruption in approval of generic drugs and some lawmakers on 
capitol hill have said youngs leaving may delay needed reforms at 
the agency 
young will end more than five years as commissioner on dec 18 
and become a deputy assistant secretary of health in charge of 
science and environmental matters both jobs are in the public 
health service which is part of hhs 
congress last year changed the law last year pertaining to the 
appointment of an fda commissioner to require senate confirmation 
as is required of other top jobs in the administration 
its a very important job and touches so much of the consumer 
safety questions its important that someone like that to have a 
level of consideration that other appointments do said a 
congressional aide who worked on the measure but spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
sources in the department who also spoke on the condition their 
names not be used said that because of the time it may take to 
select a permanent commissioner and gain approval officials are 
considering an interim appointment 
james s benson is currently the fdas second in command as 
acting deputy commissioner 
names being mentioned as early candidates for the permanent post 
include burton j lee who is president bushs personal physician 
and david pinco a washington lawyer and former fda official

president bush declared his confidence tuesday 
that europe will some day be whole and free saluting a 
decision by czechoslovakia to ease travel restrictions as just one 
more sign 
bush said he was not concerned about the dizzying pace of change 
sweeping eastern europe i dont think its moving too fast and i 
dont know of anybody in my administration that feels that its 
moving too fast 
the white house said the administration was reviewing 
developments in eastern europe with an eye toward changing 
relationships and new policies and programs 
there are large issues of eastwest relations of the 
natowarsaw pacts future of the status of the soviet empire as 
these countries change their relationship with the soviet union 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
all of those isues and questions are being considered by the 
united states government at this time fitzwater said im not 
going to suggest any conclusions were just at the beginning 
of that process 
the president left open the possibility he will stop in brussels 
to brief nato allies after his shipboard summit in the 
mediterranean with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on dec 2 
and 3 
were thinking right now how we might stay in touch with our 
allies bush said 
bush made his remarks in response to the announcement that 
czechoslovakia one of the last hardline soviet bloc nations no 
longer will require its citizens to obtain exit visas to travel 
outside their country no date for the change was given in the 
czech announcement 
gorbachev talks about a common home bush said we talk 
about a europe whole and free and its a most exciting time 
bush spoke about eastern europe during several appearances 
during the day i am delighted with the new moves towards 
democracy in eastern europe were all caught up in this he told 
foreign ministers from the organization of american states 
during a meeting with members of congress bush also said he 
will press gorbachev next month to halt the shipment of east bloc 
arms to the leftist government of nicaragua 
in preparation for the summit bush and his national security 
adviser brent scowcroft had dinner monday night with former 
secretary of state henry a kissinger who has expressed fears that 
gorbachev will try to enlist the united states as a partner with 
him in the division of germany 
separately bush told reporters that his wife barbara will not 
accompany him to malta 
bush is being pressured by democrats to respond more strongly to 
the changes sweeping eastern europe dramatized last week by the 
opening of the berlin wall and the promise of greater democracy in 
east germany 
to comment on the announcement from prague bush broke his own 
rule against answering questions from reporters during phototaking 
sessions 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said it was regrettable that bush through his spokesman 
had rejected the idea of going to berlin to express american 
satisfaction with the symbolic destruction of the wall or to 
normalize trade relations with the soviet union 
while the president has rejected all of these he has reversed 
himself on issues before and i hold out out hope he will do so 
again mitchell said 
on monday the majority leader had urged bush to travel to the 
berlin wall convene a meeting of the western allies and suspend 
trade restrictions against the soviet union the white house said 
it was highly unlikely bush would go to berlin 
white house officials said the lowkeyed approach taken by bush 
was intended to lend support and encouragement to developments in 
eastern europe while guarding against doing anything that might 
provoke a crackdown or slow the pace of reforms 
bush responding to questions during an oval office meeting with 
tunisian president zine el abidine ben ali said he was pleased by 
the easing of travel restrictions in czechoslovakia calling it a 
very encouraging first step 
he said several months ago we called for a europe whole and 
free and as i survey the changes taking place it seems to be 
moving towards a europe whole and free 
bush said the people of czechoslovakia have the same 
aspirations for freedom that others have and i would expect wed 
see further changes there just as we have seen in poland hungary 
and in east germany 
so its a very good and encouraging step he added and 
this is further manifestation that europe some day will be whole 
and free 
meanwhile the white house signaled its approval of a 738 
million aid package for poland and hungary that is nearing approval 
in the senate 
were generally supportive spokesman fitzwater said wed 
like to give billions if we had them 
asked if the united states would like to see free elections in 
east germany fitzwater said we would like to see the peoples 
rights and wills determined by themselves and we think there is a 
very constructive course of freedom under way in east germany and 
the other parts of eastern europe 
fitzwater praised the lifting of travel restrictions in 
czechoslovakia and added were not surprised by anything 
anymore

president bush said tuesday that he will press 
in next months meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
for an end to the shipment of east bloc arms to central america 
bush made the comment at the outset of a meeting with the 
observer team he named to monitor the february elections in 
nicaragua 
at the same time the state department said it has called in 
from retirement harry shlaudeman a diplomat with long years of 
experience on central america to give advice and monitor talks in 
washington between the nicaraguan government and the contra rebels 
bush was asked what the soviet union can do for peace in central 
america 
what the soviets can do is help facilitate free elections by 
stopping to send arms into this hemisphere and support for the one 
country that seems to be swimming against the tide he said 
this was a reference to the us view that sovietmanufactured 
arms are abetting both the leftist government of nicaragua and the 
leftist rebels in el salvador 
i expect ill have a chance at the malta meeting with 
gorbachev to elaborate on that in a little bit more detail 
bush said 
separately bush told ministers of the organization of american 
states meeting here how upset i am that at a time when were all 
trying to build peace in central america through diplomatic means 
the fmln guerrilla movement in el salvador aided and abetted by 
nicaragua and the cuban government has resorted to senseless 
bloodshed and gross violations of all the agreements reached to 
promote peace in central america 
shlaudeman 63 has agreed to work as a consultant to the 
department on the nicaragua talks but state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said he will not participate directly in the 
discussions nor have substantive contact with sandinista officials 
nonetheless a senior official said shlaudeman did have a 
halfhour meeting in recent days with sandinista diplomats at their 
request he was in a listening capacity said the official 
asking not to be identified 
shlaudeman ended his 35year diplomatic career last may after a 
tour as ambassador to brazil he assumed his consultants duties 
last month 
the talks between the sandinistas and the contras began at the 
united nations thursday and were moved here monday 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega called off a 19month old 
ceasefire with the rebels nov 1 and simultaneously proposed the 
first direct discussions between the sandinistas and the resistance 
since june 1988 
the main sandinista objective is the demobilization of the 
contras consistent with a communique issued by the central 
american presidents last august 
the rebels meanwhile are stressing the need to restore the 
ceasefire 
ms tutwiler said a new proposal was on the table at the talks 
tuesday with some common points of agreement she had no 
further details 
shlaudeman was the chief us negotiator for bilateral 
discussions between the united states and nicaragua for an 
eightmonth period starting in june 1984 
the reagan administration broke off the talks contending that 
the sandinista side was not negotiating in good faith there have 
been no substantive discussions between the two countries since 
january 1985 and ms tutwiler said that policy is unchanged 
shlaudemans principal contact with the nicaraguan government 
during the 198485 period was vice foreign minister victor hugo 
tinoco who is leading the sandinista delegation to the talks with 
the contras 
shlaudeman also was a special us envoy to central america 
making frequent trips to the region at the time when the 
nowdefunct contadora peace process was under way 
the presidential monitoring commission will be chaired by sen 
richard lugar rind and rep anthony c beilenson dcalif 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the lawmakers will make numerous visits to nicaragua over the 
next 3 months to monitor the election preparations and the 
balloting itself where opposition candidate violeta de chamorro is 
seeking to unseat ortega 
fitzwater said the lawmakers in small groups will make 15 
trips to the central american country between now and feb 25 
joining lugar and beilenson on the presidents observer panel

the aflcio on tuesday vowed an aggressive 
campaign for passage of a national health care plan and sen edward 
m kennedy promised that congress would adopt one next year 
delegates to the labor federations convention endorsed a 
resolution calling for an intensive lobbying campaign as well as 
efforts to convince employers to join with unions in the effort 
labor in the past has endorsed kennedysponsored proposals to 
require private employers to provide private health insurance to 
workers but a leader of the new campaign said the 14million member 
federation was entering the lobbying effort with an open mind 
we are most interested in forging a consensus that we must as 
a nation find a solution that ensures universal access to quality 
care at a price we can afford said john sweeney president of 
the service employees international union 
sweeney said the campaign to be formally announced wednesday 
would include meetings of hundreds of rank and file with 
members of congress in their home districts 
he said rising health care costs have limited worker pay 
increases because rising premiums have squeezed company profits and 
also because employer efforts to shift insurance costs to workers 
have dominated contract talks 
to demonstrate its commitment to the campaign several 
presidents of the federations largest unions spoke in favor of the 
plan 
let us leave this convention commited to mobilizing the 
roughly 90 percent of american citizens who are unhappy with our 
current system said united auto workers president owen bieber 
this is an issue whose time has come and an issue on which the 
labor movement must provide leadership 
jack barry president of the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers said the rising costs were due to the 
insatiable greed of health care providers 
the resolution calling for the healthcare campaign was passed 
on an afternoon dedicated the familyrelated issues and speeches 
from two of labor staunchest allies in congress kennedy and sen 
barbara mikulski dmd earlier in the day the convention heard an 
emotional speech from solidarity leader lech walesa who thanked 
american unions for their support of the polish trade union he 
leads 
also endorsed were pending congressional bills to increase 
federal funds for day care and to require parental leave to care 
for newborn and ill children 
kennedy dmass told the 800 delegates congress would endorse 
a national health care plan in 1990 
the ameican people understand the need kennedy said 
politicians are stating to understand progressive businesses are 
beginning to understand and by the time you finish the national 
health care campaign you ared launching at this convention 
president george bush will catch on too and have no choice but to 
sign this bill we intend to sent to him in 1990

anthony moseley sees a world of 
possibility in french fries they can curve sideways or spiral 
upward taste like a potato or have the bite of sharp cheddar 
in fact the future of french fries is so bright theyll be 
coming every sort of way except with shades says moseley 
marketing director for the nations largest potato processor 
customers will still buy the normal straight potatoes but 
theyve gotten a little bored with them moseley said in an 
interview at the headquarters of lambweston inc 
i think thats why seasoning comes into play he said 
people are going to more unique cuts and more flavored potato 
products 
lambweston which supplies 30 percent of the nations frozen 
potatoes offers frozen tempura fries in curly or crisscross 
shapes potato skins cheddar fries spicy fries oval potato 
slices and tiny baked potatoes 
thats where the business is up moseley said 
examples include the restaurant chain arbys which is selling a 
lambweston seasoned curly fry he said 
hardees and rax restaurants also offer potato options and 
mcdonalds is investigating an alternative potato he said 
fastfood chains also are demanding lowcholesterol frying oils 
such as canola oil to keep healthconscious customers happy 
moseley said 
competition from baked potatoes potato chips and other spud 
products are threatening the market share of the venerable french 
fry in restaurants and grocery stores industry officials say 
the demand for fries is not declining but holding steady 
said nancy mccarthy of the potato board in denver but chips are 
going up an average of 5 percent increase a year 
the nation consumes about 55 billion pounds of frozen potatoes 
a year and ms mccarthy said annual per capita consumption of 
potatoes is rising from 115 pounds in 1980 to 123 pounds in 1987 
the biggest change is that frozen potatoes are capturing more 
and more of the market as consumers become strapped for time that 
benefits northwest growers who send the bulk of their crop to 
processors 
consumers on average ate 746 pounds of processed potatoes and 
47 pounds of fresh potatoes in 1987 ms mccarthy said that 
compared to 1980 when consumers ate 64 pounds of processed spuds 
and 51 pounds of fresh she said 
its a lot easier to pick up frozen french fries than to make 
your own she said i dont think were raising a generation 
that can cook

a soviet official appealed on tuesday for more 
us imports from the soviet union and us support for soviet 
participation in the organization that makes rules for world trade 
when we send you our equipment and you compare it with the 
same equipment from some other countries the duties are two five 
or 10 times more said igor khotsialov of the soviet governments 
foreign economic commission 
he said the soviet union is interested in selling machinery to 
the united states pointing out that it sells machine tools and 
other equipment to britain 
us duties on soviet goods are high because the jacksonvanik 
amendment to the trade act of 1974 denies lower rates to countries 
that limit emigration 
president bush could grant the lower rates waiving the 
amendment and applying a familiar trade rule that would give the 
soviets all the privileges of the most favored nation he has 
said he first wants to see the soviets enact a law that would 
confirm recent liberal soviet policies on emigration any new 
arrangements would also need approval from congress 
the supreme soviet is expected to pass an emigration law soon 
khotsialov said the soviets need advice from american officials 
and business people on how to work with the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade gatt and the organization that administers it 
the gatt organization with headquarters in geneva switzerland is 
sponsoring negotiations among more than 100 countries to set up new 
rules on trade including for the first time trade in services and 
a reduction in the subsidies on farm trade that cost taxpayers 
billions of dollars every year 
we are eager to be in gatt khotsialov said 
that requires some some conditions on our side too but in 
this case we need your support if you want us in the gatt i 
think we will be in the gatt 
khotsialov spoke on the eve of two days of talks between a 
soviet mission headed by foreign economics minister konstantin 
katushev and commerce secretary robert mosbacher he addressed the 
eastwest forum a private group that seeks to promote trade 
on tuesday katushev met with jack parnell deputy secretary of 
agriculture the bulk of us trade with the soviet union consists 
in soviet imports of us wheat maize and soybeans 
marion blakey mosbachers spokeswoman said the two days of 
meetings will cover trade and investment questions including the 
reduction of us tariffs on soviet goods

the house on tuesday approved a foreign aid 
bill that offers up to 85 million for el salvadors besieged 
military but also contains so many competing demands for cash that 
the full amount may not be available 
the compromise bill which came up just a day before polish 
labor leader lech walesa was to address a joint meeting of 
congress also contained the first hard cash to back up a promised 
threeyear us aid program for poland and hungary the vote on the 
overall measure was 324 to 93 
one contentious issue in the 146 billion bill was defused when 
the house voted to give president bush the right to withhold 15 
million for the united nations population fund if he finds the 
agency supports forced abortions or sterilizations in china 
but a veto threat against the bill remained over a prohibition 
on the use of foreign aid money to persuade other countries to 
carry out policies prohibited by us law 
for el salvador whose government is battling a fierce onslaught 
by leftist rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
the bill would provide up to 85 million in military aid 12 
million for police training and equipment 
because lawmakers larded the bill with dozens of provisions 
requiring that certain amounts go to various other countries and 
programs it is unlikely there will be enough military aid money 
left to give the rightist government of alfredo cristiani its full 
aid complement 
for eastern europe the bill included 293 million to fund the 
first year of the threeyear program to encourage political and 
economic reform in poland and hungary along with 240 million in 
standby credit and trade insurance a total of 533 million 
major elements of the appropriations measure included a 200 
million grant to help stabilize polands battered economy and 45 
million for a private enterprise development fund other money 
would go for environmental cleanup agriculture and educational and 
cultural exchanges 
bush had threatened a veto on issues growing out of two highly 
political controversies abortion and the reagan administrations 
conduct during the irancontra affair 
the bill had provided 15 million to support the un population 
fund reversing a fiveyear ban on us aid to that agency the aid 
was included in the senate by sen barbara mikulski dmd who 
argued that it was time to resume help for the uns family 
planning efforts 
what were talking about here is the lives of women said 
rep jan meyers rkan noting that the average number of births 
per woman in subsaharan africa is 65 and that pregnancy causes 
one in four deaths there among women aged 15 to 49 
but opponents noted that the agency operates programs in china 
which has a onechildperfamily policy that allegedly has led to 
forced abortions and sterilizations antiabortion forces sought to 
kill the provision despite a stipulation in the bill that the us 
money not be used in china 
rep christopher smith rnj couched the issue as one of 
coercive against voluntary family planning andnoted that any money 
to the un agency would free funds to be used in china 
in a pair of apparently contradictory votes opponents first 
failed on a vote of 244178 to delete the money from the bill then 
prevailed 219 to 203 when they sought to place conditions on the 
family planning aid 
the motion which passed would let bush withhold the funding if 
he determines that the un agency supports any program of coerced 
abortion or sterilization and smith said that would remove a bush 
veto threat on the issue 
the remaining provision tempting a veto was a ban on the use of 
foreign aid money to leverage other countries that receive it 
into carrying out us policies that are contrary to the law 
documents released at the trial of irancontra figure oliver north 
showed the united states had expedited aid to honduras as a reward 
for its harboring of the contra rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist 
government 
overall the measure included 47 billion in military aid and 
32 billion in economic aid 
among major earmarks for countries in the bill were 3 billion 
for israel and 21 billion for egypt always the largest aid 
recipients because of their participation in the camp david middle 
east peace process 
other large recipients included pakistan with 460 million in 
military and economic aid turkey 500 million in military aid 
greece 350 million in military aid 63 million in military and 
economic aid for morocco and 125 million in military aid to help 
the countries of colombia peru and bolivia fight the war on drugs 
in addition the agreement provides 160 million for the us 
contribution to the multilateral assistance initiative for the 
philippines 83 million for afghanistan relief 83 million for 
jordan and 30 million in military aid to countries in subsaharan 
africa

a majority of the senate supported a 
capitalgains tax cut on a procedural vote tuesday but the number 
fell short of the 60 needed to halt a democratic filibuster against 
the reduction 
the vote on limiting debate on the cut which president bush 
proposed was 5147 republicans will get another try to limit 
debate wednesday if that fails the issue will be put to rest for 
the year 
leaders of both parties have said no reduction is likely this 
year tuesdays debate was set up to give backers of a 
capitalgains cut the chance to show their strength 
this is a situation where everyone gains said sen bob 
packwood rore contending that a tax cut would benefit investors 
while producing increased revenue for the government to spend on 
social programs you dont get many deals better than that 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine who has led 
opposition to a capitalgains cut said that in the long term the 
proposal would worsen the budget deficit by tens of billions of 
dollars this amendment symbolizes the excesses of the last 
decade especially the unprecedented irresponsibiity in federal 
fiscal policy 
this is budget fraud that is astonishing in its audacity and 
irresponsiblity mitchell said this amendment is designed to 
do one thing only give president bush a political victory no 
matter what the longterm cost to the american people 
bush campaigned last year on a pledge to cut taxes on capital 
gains which are profits from the sale of investments he said a 
cut would spur investment and job creation 
democrats generally are opposed arguing that 80 percent of the 
benefit of a reduction would go to those with incomes of more than 
100000 a year 
the proposed reduction has been the dominant point of contention 
between congress and the president this year the house with 
significant democratic support approved a capitalgains cut in 
september 
before 1986 only 40 percent of capital gains from property 
owned more than one year was taxable since that time capital 
gains have been fully taxable at the same rates applied to other 
income 
packwoods amendment also included a provision written by sen 
bill roth rdel to create a new type of individual retirement 
account that at least for a few years would help pay for the 
capitalgains cut 
under the republican amendment the longer an asset was held 
the less of the profit from its sale would be taxed 
thus only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset 
owned more than one year would be taxed that percentage would 
increase by five points for each additional year up to seven only 
65 percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more than 
seven years is sold 
the gop plan for expanding iras would use a different approach 
than was used by more than 15 million when deductible iras were 
open to all workers the oldstyle ira which now is restricted to 
lowerincome workers and those not covered by a company pension 
permits a tax deduction for the maximum 2000ayear contribution 
the packwoodroth amendment would permit workers to set aside up 
to 2000 a year but receive no tax deduction instead interest on 
the account would never be taxed in addition penaltyfree 
withdrawals could be made from the ira to pay medical or education 
expenses or for retirement 
workers would be permitted to to convert their current 
taxdeductible iras into the new accounts by paying tax on 
contributions that had been deducted in the past packwood and roth 
cited estimates that these rollovers would produce enough 
revenue for the government to pay for the cut in capitalgains 
taxes 
the capitalgains cut passed by the house contained no changes 
in iras until 1992 it would exclude 30 percent of gains from 
taxation after that only the portion of gains attributable to 
inflation would be excluded

unit for evaluation the governors office said 
affective disorder is a psychiatric term referring to such 
problems as mood swings and depression mrs dukakis doctor has 
said she suffers from depression 
mindy lubber a spokeswoman for the governor said it wasnt 
known how long mrs dukakis would remain at deaconess 
asked if mrs dukakis was being treated for a combination of 
depression and alcoholism ms lubber said those are some of the 
issues relating to her treatment that mrs dukakis is only 
discussing with her family and her doctors 
janna crittendon a spokeswoman for the deaconess said tuesday 
that mrs dukakis condition was satisfactory 
the affective disorders unit is a 27bed section run by harvard 
medical school faculty ms crittendon said it offers diagnosis 
and treatment of patients she said the average length of stay is 
16 days 
symptoms of mood disorder include disturbed sleep and disrupted

a multiracial jury was sworn in tuesday to hear 
the manslaughter case against a miami police officer accused of 
shooting a black motorcyclist sparking three days of rioting in 
january 
dade circuit judge joseph farina dismissed lastminute defense 
appeals to move the trial from this racially divided city and 
scheduled opening arguments for wednesday 
this case your honor has been surrounded by violence since 
the beginning defense attorney roy black argued in seeking a 
change of venue 
prosecutor richard shiffrin countered by saying three weeks of 
intensive questioning had produced an impartial panel that would 
not be influenced by fears that their verdict could spark renewed 
rioting 
the jury of two blacks one hispanic and three nonhispanic 
whites will decide the case against william lozano who fatally 
shot clement lloyd 23 lloyds passenger allan blanchard 24 
died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed 
the jury will be sequestered during the trial which could last 
up to six weeks 
fears that an acquittal could set off new rioting were somewhat 
calmed by the presence of two blacks on the jury said william 
sims a member of the dade county community relations board 
its not so tense people are just aware watching sims 
said the fact that the jury resembles the triethnic balance of 
this community goes a long way in reducing that level of tensions 
the judge also brushed aside new defense attempts to unseat 
black juror ezra simmons a state appeals court ruled monday that 
farina rightfully seated the black union leader after finding the 
defense had challenged him solely on the basis of race 
black introduced new testimony from a private detective tuesday 
attempting to show simmons was unreliable in employment hearings 
but the judge again refused to exclude the juror 
following tuesdays hearing black complained that the judges 
rulings in the case have already excluded 75 percent of our 
defense 
in earlier pretrial motions farina denied defense efforts to 
introduce lloyds drug connections and police record 
farina also ruled that the prosecution can use testimony about 
miami city police regulations in an attempt to show lozano acted 
negligently and unprofessionally when he shot and killed lloyd 
the defense however may bring up 55 grams of marijuana found 
on lloyds body as well as 1500 cash he had in his pocket they 
may also tell jurors that lloyd had alcohol and high level of thc 
marijauanas active ingredient in his bloodstream the judge 
barred such testimony about passenger blanchard 
lozano faces two manslaughter counts for the deaths of lloyd and 
blanchard in the subsequent racial violence one person was 
killed 11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned 
down 
if convicted on both counts he would face a maximum penalty of 
60 years imprisonment 
lozano fired one shot hitting lloyd in the head and killing 
him as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer 
the defense argues lozano acted in selfdefense against a 
drugcrazed dealer who did not want to be sent back to jail and 
was willing to run the officer over to escape

the senate on tuesday overwhelmingly approved 
a threeyear 738 million aid package to reinforce efforts by 
poland and hungary to discard communism and build democracy and 
free enterprise 
the vote was 990 
the senate action came on the eve of an address to a joint 
meeting of congress by lech walesa leader of polands solidarity 
labor union who is seeking a massive infusion of western aid to 
energize his countrys battered economy and shore up its flegling 
democracy 
lech walesa this is for you and a free poland said sen 
paul simon dill immediately after the senate acted 
this bill gives solidarity a fighting chance to succeed 
said simon who was the bills principal democratic sponsor 
polish democracy deserves our firm support simon said to 
this point our words have generally outstripped our deeds this 
will help change that 
it almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in 
eastern europe is mindboggling but thank god for it said sen 
gordon humphrey rnh as the senates work on the bill neared 
completion 
we must do all we can afford as quickly as we can to help 
make these changes in eastern europe irreversible humphrey said 
the senate bill represents a bipartisan compromise over the 
scale of the aid plan an issue that has been contentious from the 
start 
senate democrats originally had sought a threeyear 
authorization level for the two east european nations of 989 
million while republicans campaigned for a 585 million ceiling 
all the proposals including the 840 million authorized earlier 
by the house overshadow the total 455 million proposed in 
increments over the last several months by president bush 
asked if bush favors 738 million in aid for the two countries 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said were generally 
supportive wed like to get billions if we had them 
the house meanwhile provided the first hard cash to back up 
the aid made possible by the senate authorization bill lawmakers 
passed a foreign aid appropriations measure for the 1990 fiscal 
year that included 293 million for the first year of the 
threeyear aid program along with another 240 million in standby 
credit and trade insurance 
major elements of the appropriations measure included a 200 
million grant to help stabilize polands battered economy and 45 
million for a private enterprise development fund other money 
would go for environmental cleanup agriculture and educational and 
cultural exchanges 
however the money bill the product of a housesenate 
conference remained the subject of a veto threat over unrelated 
provisions which the bush administration opposes 
the senate authorization bill builds on key elements originally 
advocated by the bush including enterprise funds to help both 
nations move away from communist centralized economies toward 
freemarket systems 
the enterprise funds intended to help both countries establish 
freemarket systems would allocate 260 million for poland and 65 
million for hungary 
in recognition of polands serious economic problems the bill 
allocates 657 million for that country over three years hungary 
would receive 81 million 
the senate compromise plan drops a 200 million credit 
stabilization plan for poland which republicans said would only 
increase polands large foreign debt 
the only senator not voting for the aid plan was spark 
matsunaga dhawaii who is ill

leaders of the 12nation european community will 
meet saturday in the elysee palace to analyze the surge of changes 
in the soviet bloc and how they can influence europes future 
instead of the superpowers 
president francois mitterrand in a surprise move monday 
invited the other european community ec members to a special 
summit 
there had been calls for such a meeting to be held before the 
summit of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush 
set for dec 23 aboard ships off malta 
the ec also known as the european common market had scheduled 
a summit conference for dec 89 in strasbourg france but the 
flood of events in eastern europe prompted mitterrand to call the 
special meeting in advance of the ussoviet and ec summits 
former french foreign minister michel jobert said in a radio 
interview do we want the united states and the soviet union 
once again to decide the destiny of europe 
and former president valery giscard destaing the leader of 
frances main centrist political coalition had urged mitterrands 
socialist government to call an emergency ec summit 
in a radio interview sunday giscard destaing said it would be 
unacceptable that the first analysis of the events in europe be 
made by the americans and the soviets and not by the europeans 
mitterrand called saturdays meeting as ec president he is 
president of the organization under a sixmonth rotating system and 
his term ends with the strasbourg summit 
there were indications that most other ec leaders welcomed the 
elysee palace summit 
british prime minister margaret thatcher in a speech monday 
night did not refer to mitterrands invitation but said the 
community should see what is happening as a great turning point in 
europes history and its response must measure up to that 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister said 
it is important that the european community gets together on such 
a dramatic development besides analyzing the situation one must 
also examine what the ec can do to help the people and to ensure 
that the reform process develops in a stable manner 
in his invitations mitterrand said the summit was called to 
discuss the recent developments in the situation in europe 
it is rare for ec leaders to meet at the top level outside the 
framework of their semiannual summits and even more unusual that 
such a meeting could be organized so quickly 
analysts said the elysee palace dinnersummit could serve two 
major purposes it gives the europeans a chance to organize their 
position before the ussoviet conference and keeps the agenda of 
the strasbourg summit open for mitterrands two pet projects 
european monetary union and a european social charter 
west german chancellor helmut kohl had asked mitterrand to make 
the german question the central theme of the strasbourg meeting 
that probably would have served mrs thatcher and some west german 
officials who are not enthusiastic about a monetary union and 
social charter

the friendly weekend invasion from the east when 
the berlin wall was opened cost the west german government 82 
million in welcome money the citys bankers said tuesday 
the west berlin bank association said 15 million visitors from 
east germany came through the wall and banks gave each 100 marks 
55 on the governments behalf for a total of 150 million marks 
or about 82 million 
figures were not available from the other parts of west germany 
visited by 15 million more east germans but the total paid in 
welcome money probably was double the west berlin figure 
by government policy each east german visitor is entitled to 
100 marks once a year east germans traveling abroad can take along 
only 15 west german marks equivalent to a little more than 8 and 
east german marks are not covertible 
earlier tuesday west berlin banks threatened to suspend 
payments of welcome money unless bonn covered their operating 
costs and the government agreed the banks stayed open most of the 
weekend to handle long lines of east germans 
officials said the government was raising its total welcome 
money allocation from 479 million marks to 779 million

for namibia after 74 years of south african rule 
swapo will hold 41 seats in the assembly and the democratic 
turnhalle alliance 21 
the united democratic front will have four seats followed by 
the conservative allwhite action christian national with three 
the federal convention of namibia national patriotic front and the 
namibia national front each won a single seat 
the assemblys decisions must be backed by at least 48 members 
in spite of the difficulties in spite of all the odds placed 
in our way to victory the liberation movement has won said 
senior swapo spokesman hidipo hamutenya 
the election result was seen as promising for a peaceful 
transition to independence for the sparsely populated region of 
southern africa 
some observers feared that if swapo won a twothirds majority 
it might have written a constitution leaning heavily in its favor 
had the organization won less than 50 percent of the vote it 
may have challenged the results and accused south africa of trying 
to prevent a swapo government 
the chairman of the democratic turnhalle alliance dirk mudge 
said his organization had no plans to align itself with another 
party but if swapo comes with a constitutional proposal we can 
live with we will support it 
the assembly is to meet within a week and the 1500 south 
african troops in namibia are to withdraw shortly un 
peacekeepers are scheduled to leave namibia at the end of march 
the top un official in namibia martti ahtisaari said he 
expected namibia to achieve independence before then ahtisaari 
who certified the election results said namibia has given the 
whole world a shining lesson in democracy 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he was 
confident the various parties would be able to work through their 
differences and adopt a constitution with the same degree of 
enthusiasm and patriotism that they displayed during the course of 
the electoral process 
in addition to the un monitors dozens of private groups 
observed the elections edmund muskie a former senator and 
secretary of state who headed the official us delegation said 
the process of the elections was victory by and for the namibian 
people 
in washington the state department said it wished the namibian 
people well as they start drafting the new constitution 
we look forward to working with the government that emerges 
after independence said the statement 
in brussels a delegation of european parliamentarians sent to 
observe the elections said there had been no fraud 
there was no fraud possible said henri saby head of the 
13member delegation he said the vote took place in an 
extraordinary climate of good citizenship 
south africa captured namibia from germany in world war i and 
ruled it under a league of nations mandate that mandate was 
rescinded by the united nations in 1966 but south africa refused 
un orders to withdraw from the territory 
swapo took up arms against south africa in 1966 
in december 1988 south africa agreed to grant independence to 
namibia as part of a regional treaty that also called for the 
phased withdrawal of cuban troops from angola namibias northern 
neighbor the cubans were backing the angolan government in its war 
with rebels supported by south africa and the united states

as rightwing israelis shouted and banged their 
fists on lecture hall doors tuesday a proplo palestinian leader 
and hundreds of jewish and arab students discussed the bloody 
conflict between their people 
several fistfights erupted outside the hebrew university lecture 
hall shortly after faisal husseini a leading palestinian activist 
was led in encircled by arab students 
security guards and plainclothes police scuffled with dozens of 
rightwing activists wearing the knitted skullcaps of observant 
jews and at least one israeli was dragged out kicking and pushing 
but inside the peace dialogue went on as planned by a leftwing 
arabjewish student group and the jerusalem arab students 
committee it was designed to mark the first anniversary of the 
declaration of palestinian independence issued by the palestine 
national council the plos parliamentinexile 
were fighting for our own freedom and not for the enslavement 
of others for our own country and not for the destruction of 
another country declared husseini who comes from one of the 
most powerful palestinian families 
i want to send a message to israeli leaders theres no other 
way to peace but through the leaders of another people and this 
leadership is the plo he said interrupted by loud applause 
israel refuses to talk to the plo which it officially sees as a 
terrorist group bent on destroying the jewish state it is willing 
to negotiate elections with nonplo palestinians from the occupied 
territories and then hold talks on limited autonomy with the 
elected delegates 
husseini who has been jailed without trial for a total of 18 
months since july 1987 insisted that israel must talk to the plo 
if it wants to negotiate peace 
i want to talk peace with prime minister yitzhak shamir 
husseini said i think hes a man of war i dont want to talk to 
him and i dont like him but he is representing the israeli 
people your enemies are the palestinians and they have 
representatives 
a jewish student argued that arabs from the west bank and the 
gaza strip could represent the palestinian side 
its well known you receive your orders from the plo said 
the student the jewish people have a psychological problem with 
the plo so why dont you stop calling them the plo and start peace 
talks 
husseini countered by saying it has been equally difficult for 
him to pronounce the word israel 
outside rightwingers banged on the doors shouting plo out 
you are a leader of killers plo go to hell 
an israeli student jumped from his seat shouting at husseini 
youre nazis youre killing jews every day he was dragged out 
of the hall by force 
an arab student then demanded to know what the next stage of the 
23monthold palestinian uprising should be 
the struggle we want to lead is civil disobedience husseini 
responded we are pushed to it by the occupation we can reach a 
solution before that if israel starts to treat us as people not 
as residents or refugees 
at least 615 palestinians have died of israeli gunfire and 41 
israelis have been slain in the rebellion 
at the end of the threehour meeting security guards whisked 
husseini away through a back door only to find the windshield of 
his car smashed

a salvadoran rebel leader said tuesday 
that el salvadors armed forces must be purged of a truly 
criminal element before the rebels will resume peace talks with 
the government 
commander mario lopez of the politicaldiplomatic commission of 
the guerrillas farabundo marti national liberation front fmln

positions and advance

give any figures 
this is a process of insurrection i couldnt say how far it 
will go lopez said

between the rebels and president alfredo cristianis rightist 
government but there have been no results 
a proposal tuesday at the organization of american states 
meeting in washington by nicaraguan foreign minister miguel 
descoto could lead to such mediation lopez said he did not 
elaborate 
he said before the fmln stops the offensive and agrees to resume 
peace talks there must be a selfpurge of the armed forces that 
would lead to more democratic conditions 
the ones who govern el salvador are the armed forces its a

droughtinduced crop failure in ethiopias 
two rebellious northern provinces will be worse this season than in 
the 198485 famine that killed 1 million people according to the 
un childrens fund 
an internal document from unicef obtained tuesday by the 
associated press says up to 2 million ethiopians could be affected 
by the drought as famine conditions develop in 1990 
in 198485 relief figures indicate 1 million people starved to 
death in the northern provinces of tigre and eritrea in 198788 a 
massive international relief operation prevented a similar tragedy 
during another crop failure 
the first signs of famine already have been reported not only 
in eritrea where influxes of displaced people are on the 
increase but also in other areas in particular akele guzay 
district where farmers are selling their livestock at only 
onethird of the normal price the report says 
livestock disposal at very low prices is one of the early 
warning indicators that a drought situation is becoming alarming 
it said 
unicef officials said they will soon announce a 905 million 
fundraising campaign to provide food and services to northern 
ethiopia to prevent widespread starvation 
this drought according to the assessments of the main 
harvest planting made by un agencies including unicef and by 
the government of ethiopia will be worse than in 198485 in terms 
of crop failure the report says 
in eritrea the crop failure is estimated to be 90 to 100 
percent while in tigre it reaches 40 percent it says 
furthermore these two regions are afflicted by civil wars 
respectively 28 and 15 years old which restrict movements of goods 
and people and limit the access of assistance 
rebels in those provinces are fighting for autonomy or secession 
from the marxist central government controlled by president 
mengistu haile mariam 
up to 333000 metric tons of grain will be needed to feed 185 
million people the unicef report says

amnesty international charged on 
wednesday that burmas military rulers have arrested thousands of 
people carried out unfair trials and are holding political 
prisoners 
the londonbased human rights group called for the commutation 
of 100 death sentences that have been handed down by the martial 
law government and for the release of all political prisoners 
the amnesty report received in bangkok listed 107 prisoners 
of conscience and other political prisoners believed still in 
detention amnesty defines prisoners of conscience as people 
detained solely for peacefully expressing their beliefs 
the list of prisoners included the nations top opposition 
leader aung san suu kyi as well as a buddhist monk and a 
novelist most on the list were students and members of suu kyis 
national league for democracy 
amnesty quoted unnamed sources as saying more than 3000 people 
had been arrested since july 1989 the organization said it could 
not confirm this number because it had not been able to visit 
burma but it documented the arrests of a number of political 
opponents to the regime 
amnesty believes that arrests during this period after late 
july numbered in the thousands the report said 
last month the rangoon government announced it had arrested 
1087 people for political offenses since september 1988 when a 
group of military leaders brutally crushed a nationwide 
prodemocracy uprising the leaders set up a 17man military 
council and declared martial law 
but the formation of more than 200 political parties has been 
allowed and the military is promising general elections may 27 of 
next year 
the house arrest last july of suu kyi and tin oo leaders of the 
national league for democracy along with other senior members of 
the prodemocracy party led many western diplomats in rangoon to 
conclude that free elections were unlikely 
the government also has said it had handed down 100 death 
sentences many by special military tribunals amnesty described 
some of the trials as unfair by international standards 
similar charges have been made in recent months by the united 
states which also claims some political detainess have died under 
torture rangoon has denied this 
in a speech nov 10 gen saw maung who heads the military 
government said citizens had nothing to be afraid of unless of 
course you break the law 
there are accusations that we are following the methods of the 
japanese kempetai that is not true if they say we use gestapo 
methods then they are wrong too saw maung told a graduating 
class at burmas national defense college the japanese secret 
police kempetai and the nazis gestapo employed torture and 
committed other atrocities during world war ii

nasas planned launch of its last 
unmanned rocket saturday will send the first of several satellites 
to study how the universe has evolved since its birth in the big 
bang 15 billion years ago officials said tuesday 
the new launch date for the 150 million 4850pound cosmic 
background explorer was announced after space agency engineers 
fixed a faulty guidance computer on the rocket that will carry the 
spacecraft into orbit 
this is going to begin an explosion of knowledge about the 
universe david gilman manager of the 400 million cosmic 
background explorer program said during a news conference at the 
space agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
the satellite the hubble space telescope and three other 
observatories to be placed in earth orbit during the 1990s are 
going to provide us with an unprecedented unbelievable view of the 
universe program scientist larry caroff said 
we will see things we havent even imagined he predicted 
hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the world 
of science 
the satellite is scheduled for launch from vandenberg air force 
base on the central california coast during a 30minute period 
starting at 624 am pst saturday 
the 16by28foot solarpowered satellite is to be carried into 
a 559milehigh nearpolar orbit by a 116foottall delta rocket 
the last unmanned expendable rocket to be launched by the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
nasa will continue to launch manned shuttles and possibly 
unmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters but the air force 
or private companies will charge nasa to launch any payloads that 
require unmanned expendable rockets 
the satellites launch had been scheduled for friday then was 
delayed until sunday because of a malfunctioning guidance computer 
but the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the 
launch was moved up to saturday said peter eaton a nasa rocket 
official 
the satellite was to have originally been put in orbit by a 
shuttle but was diverted to an unmanned rocket after the 1986 
challenger disaster 
once in orbit and after a 30day shakedown the satellite will 
spend up to two years measuring cosmic background radiation which 
makes up about 2 percent of the static on a television set it 
includes microwaves heat and other electromagnetic radiation given 
off by the big bang the gargantuan explosion scientists 
believe created the universe an estimated 15 billion years ago 
the radiation were measuring is actually the remnant of the 
great explosion itself project scientist john mather said 
were looking at it as it was a very long time ago were seeing 
the primary cosmic fossil 
with the three most sensitive sensors of their types the 
satellite will measure the collective glow of all the stars and 
galaxies and whatever else has been there since the beginning 
mather said 
that will help scientists learn more about what happened in the 
time between three minutes after the big bang when the first 
atomic nuclei or centers formed and 500000 years later when the 
first atoms formed it also will search for light from the creation 
of the first stars and galaxies about 200 million years after the 
primeval fireball 
mather said nasa will share information from the mission with 
the soviet union which has flown one similar research mission and 
plans two others 
a shuttle is scheduled to carry the hubble space telescope into 
orbit in march an optical telescope of unprecedented power it 
also may see formation of the earliest galaxies said nancy 
boggess deputy project scientist on the cosmic background explorer 
program 
that will be followed by the shuttle launches of the gamma ray 
observatory in june and the advanced xray astrophysics facility in 
1997 gilman said a private expendable rocket will launch the 
space infrared telescope facility in 1999 he added

home after a 10hour citywide manhunt police said he was 
arraigned tuesday evening on four counts of second degree murder 
and returned to jail 
two of the murder counts charged him with the deaths of the two 
detectives and the other two with felony murder or murder during 
the furtherance of a crime which was escape he also was charged 
with firstdegree escape and seconddegree criminal possession of a 
weapon 
the maximum penalty for murder in new york is 25 years to life 
harrison had been taken from jail to the queens district 
attorneys office monday to take a lie detector test and discuss a 
plea bargain 
later a series of mistakes allowed harrison to steal a loaded 
gun and surprise the two officers while they were returning him to 
the citys jail complex on rikers island authorities said tuesday 
if you make a mistake in this business it can have terrible 
results these two detectives got careless for a minute or two 
and it cost them their lives police commissioner richard condon 
said at a news conference tuesday 
harrison was able to fire at least five shots from the stolen 
gun while he was being driven down grand central parkway neither 
officer was able to reach revolvers in their ankle holsters and 
both were dead at the scene they were identified as detectives 
keith l williams 34 an eightyear veran of brooklyn and 
richard j guerzon 46 a 20year veteran of merrick 
guerzon is to be buried thursday williams on friday 
the suspects story is that the two officers were shot during a 
robbery and the gunman freed him after killing the detectives 
said assistant district attorney bob alexander 
during his brief arraignment in state supreme court in queens 
harrison stood silently as defense attorney michael selio said he 
reserved the right to make a bail application at a later date 
the errors began authorities said when harrison was left alone 
in a detectives squad room where he stole the gun from either an 
unlocked locker or one with a defective lock prisoners kept in the 
room are usually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers 
harrison was supposed to be searched before his return to rikers 
island either he wasnt or someone failed to locate the 
38caliber service revolver during their check condon said 
harrison might also have been cuffed with his hands in front 
rather than behind his back he said 
on the way back to rikers harrison was seated alone in the back 
seat with the two detectives in front another violation of 
procedure said condon 
guerzon who had been driving was shot twice in the head 
williams was shot twice in the back and once in the head 
despite his criminal background harrisons neighbors said he 
was a wellbehaved man whose mother made sure he received the best 
of everything 
he doesnt come off as arrogant always was friendly and 
polite said larry young who has known the mother and son for 15 
years hes like a dr jekyll and mr hyde personality 
harrison has a record dating to 1980 when he was convicted of 
assault at age 16 after several drug and additional assault 
charges he was sentenced to 364 days in jail four years ago for 
biting off a girlfriends ear 
at the time of the police shootings he was serving a 
twotofouryear sentence on a drug conviction 
he also was charged in july with strangling another girlfriend 
after a night of partying and drugtaking and still faced trial

the house on tuesday changed its rules which 
it has been violating for years to give its speaker full access to 
secret files and hearings in the house intelligence committee 
rep henry hyde rill used the occasion to tout several 
proposals he has offered but which have been stymied by the 
democratic leadership requirement of a secrecy oath and security 
clearances for members and staff on the intelligence committee and 
a reduction in the size of the panel from 19 to 13 members 
but hydes effort to bring the issues up for a vote was defeated 
on a largely partyline vote of 245 to 176 
the old rules specified that no classified information could be 
given to anyone not a member of the intelligence panel unless the 
committee first voted to authorize the move and kept detailed 
records of the information and to whom it was given 
but even though they are not members of the committee speakers 
of the house have over the years received informal briefings on 
government secrets 
the rules change adopted tuesday gives house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash and his successors blanket access to the 
intelligence committees business foley formerly was a member of 
the committee and maintains an active interest in intelligence 
matters 
the issue of speakers access to secrets arose last year when 
former speaker jim wright dtexas told reporters the central 
intelligence agency had sought to foment civil unrest in nicaragua 
to undermine the political stability of the leftist sandinista 
government 
sources later said that the information had come to the 
intelligence committee and had been relayed to wright through an 
informal briefing

west germany said tuesday it was willing to give 
east germany massive financial aid in the style of the postwar us 
marshall plan but demanded political and economic reforms the 
communists have so far rejected 
east germanys new premier said the berlin wall must remain to 
keep aids crime and other western problems out of his country he 
promised a coalition government but did not say whether the 
opposition could join it 
after a week of dramatic developments in east european 
countries president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union said 
in moscow 
they have a common direction which fosters the building of a 
european home for it makes the countries closer more open and 
creates new opportunities for human contact and an equal exchange 
the liberal democrats an east german party that is allied with 
the communists but shows signs of independence said prodemocracy 
groups should be invited in roundtable talks about east 
germanys future 
discussions this spring between polish authorities and 
solidarity which were given that name led to a noncommunist 
government in poland 
mayor walter momper of west berlin said the sudden opening of 
east germanys borders was creating traffic jams currency problems 
and other economic difficulties the two governments must resolve 
economics minister helmut haussmann of west germany announced a 
sixpoint aid plan including investments joint ventures and 
modernizing east germanys dilapidated communications and transport 
systems 
haussmann did not name a figure for the aid and said east 
germany must achieve thorough change in its centrally directed 
economy 
reforms promised so far by communist party leader egon krenz 
who took over last month from hardliner erich honecker have 
resulted in more questions than answers haussmann said in bonn 
he compared his proposal to the marshall plan devised by 
secretary of state george c marshall which provided more than 12 
billion in american aid in 194851 to help europe recover from the 
war 
east german authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a 
complete freemarket system and new premier hans modrow a leading 
reformer says he wants step by step economic changes 
modrow appears to want a streamlining of the bureaucracy but 
has given no indication he will urge sweeping changes such as those 
in hungary and poland 
he was quoted tuesday in the west germany newspaper bild as 
saying the berlin wall can remain open to travel but will not come 
down 
in our country there is little criminal activity cases of 
aids and drugs are virtually unknown he was quoted as saying 
our people are asking themselves why they shouldnt just leave 
that as it is 
adn the official news agency said the government might open a 
part of the wall near the brandenburg gate as yet another passage 
between east and west berlin the highcolumned monument is near 
the wall in east berlin and is among the citys bestknown symbols 
before east germany opened its borders thursday the gate had 
been a major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to 
travel to the west hundreds of west berliners gathered there 
tuesday in hopes a hole would be opened 
a leader of new forum east germanys main opposition group 
said it could work with a revamped communist party but naming 
modrow premier was not enough 
there are still too many people in top positions with whom 
dialogue is not possible juergen tallig spokesman for the group 
in leipzig said in a west german radio interview 
more change could occur at a special party congress in east 
berlin on dec 1517 the congress which can change the entire 
leadership set policy and alter party statutes was called late 
monday by the party central committee 
prodemocracy advocates have held huge demonstrations demanding 
an end for the 40year communist monopoly on power although modrow 
did not indicate whether the opposition would be allowed in his 
coalition he pledged to seek more cooperation with the four small 
parties allied with the communists 
guenter schabowski one of the most prominent politburo members 
and a leading reformer resigned as party chief for east berlin 
adn said and was replaced by hans albrecht 
schabowski had indicated earlier he might surrender the post 
because of a heavy workload he still is the party propaganda chief 
and political analysts believe he may get an important job in 
modrows cabinet 
guenther maleuda the new noncommunist speaker of parliament 
said he would seek to alter the first article of the constitution 
which defines the communist partys leading role in society the 
party has used the provision to defend its power monopoly 
the east german red cross said its reception centers could 
handle up to 10000 east germans returning home the west german 
red cross said it expected several thousand of the 200000 who had 
settled in the west this year to return to east germany 
mass emigration has cost east germany vital skilled workers and 
has strained the ability of west germany to provide jobs and 
housing

a survey of 4500 small business owners found 
that threequarters of them believe leveraged buyouts are bad for 
business the surveys sponsors reported tuesday 
the survey conducted by arthur andersens business group a 
subsidiary of the big eight accounting firm got responses from 
4500 small and mediumsized business owners through out the united 
states 
the survey found that 77 percent of those participating believed 
that buying a company with money borrowed against the companys 
assets are bad for the us business environment with 22 percent 
of them saying it was extremely negative 
those surveyed also believed that leveraged buyouts adversely 
affect reasearch and development expenditures capital spending 
employment and longterm business growth said james p ohalloran 
director of arthur andersens enterprise focus group 
yet 29 percent of those surveyed said they were considering 
selling all or part of their business of those who would sell 69 
percent said they would accept a foreign investor 
these figures reflect an evolution in the traditional american 
dream of building a business and passing it on to your children 
said ohalloran 
the new american dream appears to be more shortterm oriented 
allowing entrepreneurs to enjoy the fruits of their labor sooner 
he said adding that ownermanagers are more likely to cash out 
and use alternative family wealth planning strategies 
the survey now in its fourth year also reported that more than 
80 percent of the business owners have had difficulty attracting 
qualified managerial and technical personnel and 67 percent said 
they were unable to find qualified semiskilled workers

a house committee on tuesday endorsed new 
versions of two vetoed spending bills that comply with president 
bushs demand that they maintain a ban on most federally funded 
abortions including cases of rape or incest 
house speaker thomas s foley said it was time for 
abortionrights activists to face the fact that bush would 
prevail this year in the dispute but house democrats who support 
abortion rights said they may continue their fight 
a leading abortion opponent said his group still objects to one 
of the revised house bills however because it would allow local 
money to be spent on abortions for poor women in the district of 
columbia 
a group of four prochoice republican house women meanwhile 
met with the president to express their concern over his position 
on the federal abortion issue 
and on still another abortion fight the house backed away from 
risking a third bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes 15 
million for the un population fund the bill would reverse a 
fiveyear ban on us aid to that agency which promotes third 
world family planning and birth control 
bush has threatened to veto the bill because of a provision 
fought by abortion opponents they charged that because the agency 
operates in china which has a onechildperfamily policy the 
money would indirectly support forced abortions there despite a 
stipulation in the bill that the us money not be used in china 
the house voted against a move by antiabortion forces to take 
out the population fund money but then voted 219203 to accept an 
amendment that allows bush to block the money if he concludes it 
would be used for coerced abortions 
the house appropriations committee voted unanimously and without 
debate to send to the floor a revised version of the 157 billion 
bill for fiscal 1990 appropriations for labor education and health 
programs bush vetoed the bill last month because of a provision 
that would permit greater use of federal money for abortions for 
poor women allowing them for victims of rape or incest 
the panel also approved a revised bill appropriating 558 
million for the district of columbia government bush vetoed that 
measure last month objecting to provisions that would have allowed 
the dc government to use its own money to finance abortions for 
poor women 
the new version of the dc bill would prohibit the use of 
federal money for abortions in most cases but doug johnson 
lobbyist for the antiabortion national right to life committee 
said it would still permit the district to spend other government 
money for abortions and thus invites another veto in its new 
version 
the house approved the larger spending bill last month after 
voting for the first time in a decade to broaden the restrict the 
prohibitions on abortion financing but the house failed by 51 
votes to override bushs veto 
without the votes to overturn that veto we have to face the 
fact that theres going to be a denial of funds foley told 
reporters tuesday adding that prochoice forces could try again 
next year 
the president has to take responsibilty for that decision 
he said 
rep les aucoin dore a leader of the house abortionrights 
forces and a member of the appropriations committee said it would 
have been futile for his side to try to amend the bill in the 
committee 
he said abortion opponents may easily thwart floor amendments 
using parliamentary means as well but he said abortionrights 
forces in the senate who have a larger majority in that chamber 
could force the debate to continue by voting again to permit 
financing in cases of rape or incest an outcome that could for a 
second time send the bill to a housesenate conference committee to 
work out differences 
thats where the end game is going to be fought in the 
conference aucoin said 
the abortion dispute is caught up in congress hurry to adjourn 
for the year as well as concerns by some republicans that 
antiabortion positions hurt their candidates in last weeks 
elections and could hurt them further in 1990 
the temperature is going to build and well see how everyone 
feels when the temperature rises even further aucoin said 
i just have a feeling in my bones that a lot of people who 
have been opposed to our prochoice position are very eager to find 
a way to now support the victims of rape and incest and we intend 
before its all over to give them a chance he said 
four republican house women who support abortion rights came 
away from the meeting with bush saying they had voiced concerns 
that the party would be damaged by an identification with 
antiabortion forces they said bush listened to their arguments 
but gave them no commitment to relent in his opposition to the 
bills permitting more federally funded abortions 
bush plans to speak at campaign fundraisers for two of the 
women who are planning senate bids one of them rep claudine 
schneider rri said we could see the wheels of thought going 
through his mind i think he heard us

house leaders on tuesday were forced to slow 
their push for a 33 percent congressional pay raise after the white 
house balked at approving an attached ethics package 
white house counsel c boyden gray told lawmakers the plan 
failed to impose enough ethics restrictions on the legislative 
branch similar to those governing the executive branch according 
to congressional sources 
house democratic and republican leaders cancelled party caucuses 
planned for wednesday when by the end of the day tuesday the 
differences were not resolved 
the caucuses were tentatively rescheduled for thursday and the 
house scheduled changed to accommodate them time was of the 
essence because of plans to adjourn congress before thanksgiving 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said he remained confident 
he was leading an inhouse lobbying effort rarely seen for even the 
most important legislation 
foley and majority leader richard gephardt dmo plan to 
appear before the house republican conference while their gop 
counterparts minority leader robert michel rill and minority 
whip newt gingrich rga were going before the democratic caucus 
no one could remember that happening 
the rather unprecedented show of bipartisan support would 
coincide with formal introduction of the pay and ethics plan said 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the panel that drafted the 
proposal 
in advance of public release of the plan house leaders put the 
pressure on in private meetings of committees and state 
delegations they urged support for the package provided arguments 
to use when defending it with constituents and urged those 
opposing the package to do so quietly 
the extraordinary effort was afoot because pay is one of the 
most politically sensitive issues in congress 
to ease the electoral angst the pay plan would put off the bulk 
of the increase until after next years election 
a raise of 79 percent would take effect on jan 1 1990 
raising congressional pay from 89500 to 96600 a year later 
lawmakers would get a 25 percent increase federal judges and top 
executive branch officials whose pay is tied to that of congress 
would also get the increases 
the initial increase was being billed as a costofliving 
adjustment 
the second installment would be tied to an end to members 
bolstering their personal incomes by making speeches to interest 
groups goodgovernment groups including common cause have 
attacked the acceptance of speech honoraria as a corrupting force 
in congress 
fazio said tuesday that the pay plan was set up so that if the 
25 percent raise is later killed the honoraria system would be 
restored 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the senate 
would also consider eliminating honoraria but over a longer 
timetable than the house and without the 25 percent raise 
however support among senators for that position was difficult 
to determine 
sen trent lott rmiss said he considered different pay 
scales for the house and senate a mistake 
sen timothy wirth dcolo said he thought it would be 
hypocritical 
lott said he favored having the senate adopt something very 
close to the house plan with only small changes in the ethics 
rules to account for institutional differences 
but how many senators shared his viewpoint was hard to determine 
because members were playing their cards close until the house 
acts bring up the issue and you get a lot of smiles and ducking 
out back doors he said 
the waffling in the senate generated nervousness in the house 
where the last thing members want to do is vote for a pay raise and 
not get it 
rep william h gray dpa said the senate was handling it 
in their normal manner which is the way most multimillionaires 
do they pound their breasts and say we dont dare talk about the 
possibility of a cost of living adjustment while they live off 
their interest and speaking fees 
on the average senators have much more personal wealth than 
house members their current rules also allow them to bolster their 
incomes by up to 40 percent with speaking fees compared to 30 
percent in the house 
foley and the house leadership spent several hours tuesday 
working out final details of the package with white house counsel 
c boyden gray 
let there be no doubt about the presidents support for the 
ethics package its ours fitzwater said we just want them to 
pass a good strong package that meets up to the standards we set 
in our proposal

talks between nicaraguan officials and the 
contra rebels remained deadlocked tuesday night as the two sides 
were unable to bridge their differences over terms for a ceasefire 
and for demobilization of the insurgents participants said 
as the fourth day of talks ended nicaraguan cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo told reporters he was less optimistic tuesday night 
than he was last thursday when the negotiations opened at the 
united nations 
asked why there is a stalemate obando y bravo said its 
difficult because each side has his own point of view 
the head of the sandinista delegation vice foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco said he was somewhat more optimistic than he 
was after the conclusion of the talks monday night 
the discussions will resume wednesday afternoon 
obando y bravo is officially described as a witness at the 
talks also participating are representatives from the united 
nations the organization of american states and the honduran 
government 
a key sticking point is a sandinista demand that rebels now 
based inside nicaraguan territory return to base camps in honduras 
immediately after a joint ceasefire is achieved at that point 
the demobilization of the contras would begin 
the rebel position is that the estimated 5000 contras in 
nicaragua should be allowed to remain at their positions once the 
cease fire is called 
the chief contra negotiator col enrique bermudez said the 
rebels are wary of demobilization because it is an irreversible 
step that must be accompanied by guarantees for the rebels 
safety 
the sandinista position further states that once all contra 
forces have returned to the base camps in honduras the united 
states would turn over to an international commission humanitarian 
funds earmarked for the contras 
the funds would be used to contribute to the peace process 
the sandinista proposal asserts

the navy alarmed over a string of serious 
accidents tuesday ordered an unprecedented standdown from most 
routine manuevers to permit a hard look at all levels and at 
every detail of safety 
the order requires ships air squadrons and shore installations 
to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and 
operating procedures for a 48hour period sometime during the next 
three days 
however it will allow such operations as us ship movements in 
the persian gulf and drug interdiction activities to continue 
adm carlisle a h trost the chief of naval operations who 
ordered the action said it is the first time in his memory the 
navy has done such a thing 
prudent leadership demands that we take look at everything 
that might be a possible ause for this recent spate of accidents 
regardless of their severity trost told reporters at a hastily 
called pentagon press conference 
the admiral said the review asks all commanders to ask are we 
adhering to all the proper procedures are we doing what we should 
be the way we should be doing it is there something were 
overlooking are people getting careless 
trost said he has found no common thread in the recent spate of 
accidents some were the result of mechanical failure and others 
came from a lapse of attention to detail or procedure he said 
he said he did not believe that commanders were working their 
sailors too hard but that he also wanted to ensure that no 
shortcuts were being taken during the many dangerous activities 
that the navy must undertake every day 
a standdown does not say bring ships in from sea stop 
flying airplanes completely it does say the routine training 
administrative functions are secondary to the review of these 
safety procedures clearly operations around the world must 
continue trost said 
our prime resonsibility is to ensure that we have a safe 
working environment around the world so people come back home to 
their families safely the admiral said 
the action came as the navy has suffered through a series of 
mishaps since oct 29 in which 10 people have been killed or lost 
at sea and at least 45 people injured 
between jan 1 and nov 1 the navy counted 101 operation and 
training related fatalities including 47 in the explosion aboard 
the uss iowa on april 19 
trost defended the navys safety record saying that if the 
deaths from the iowa disaster are not counted this year would have 
been the safest year in this decade in respect to navy 
accidents 
another navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley said commanders 
will be able to decide when to conduct the 48hour safety 
evaluation 
this is a standdown not a shutdown quigley said there 
is no degradation of the readiness posture 
overall the navy has 599000 fulltime personnel and some 566 
ships and usually a third of those are at sea for training at any 
one time 
on tuesday before the announcement was made at the pentagon a 
us navy f14 jet fighter crashed in the gulf of mexico 60 miles 
northwest of key west fla with the crew escaping serious injury 
in a separate incident a fire aboard an amphibious assault ship 
in norfolk va injured 31 people the fire broke out aboard the 
uss inchon while it underwent shipyard maintenance in norfolk the 
navy said 
and at white oak md a technician was injured when twio grams 
of an experimental explosive mixture detonated at a laboratory at 
the naval surface weapons testing center 
the recent accidents have included a training jet crashing into 
an aircraft carrier off florida sailors who have been washed 
overboard on two different aircraft carriers and the accidental 
bombing of a cruiser in the indian ocean 
in their statement tuesday trost and navy secretary h lawrence 
garrett iii told fleet commanders and other senior officers they 
should leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of operations 
is foremost in the minds of all hands 
the obligation we have to bring every sailor home safely and 
husband the scarce resource of combat readiness dictates a hard 
look at all levels and at every detail the statement said 
the order also requires all commanders to report their findings 
rep ike skelton dmo a member of the house armed services 
committee said it was a very wise move on the navys part to 
review procedures 
skelton said it is often forgotten that even training under 
the best of circumstances it can be a dangerous profession 
rep charles bennett dfla chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials also said the navys decision was wise but he 
complained the navy has decided to make capt fred moosally 
skipper of the uss iowa eligible for another major command 
the florida democrat said garrett could accomplish the same 
objective if he did not advance people in rank who dont do a 
good job 
the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william 
crowe jr said its important that the american people 
understand that what our navy does can be dangerous this is tough 
stuff were going to have accidents but we try very hard not to 
i think that attitude is reflected in adm trosts decision 
crowe who retired last month spoke with reporters as he was 
visiting in the pentagon at the time of the navys announcement

the house on tuesday approved a bill aimed at 
reforming management of the department of housing and urban 
development and eliminating opportunities for influencepeddling 
and political favoritism 
the house agreed by a voice vote to send to the senate a hud 
reform package that includes proposals from secretary jack kemp as 
well as others arising from a congressional investigation of the 
the departments multibilliondollar scandals 
the quick action came after the house banking subcommittee on 
housing and community development approved the bill last week and 
stripped away a larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs 
some democrats had hoped to keep the two tied together as a way of 
forcing congressional action on the housing program revision 
the bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on hud 
programs register with the department and identify for whom they 
are working and report any fees civil penalties would be imposed 
for those who fail to comply 
grant recipients would have to report any use of consultants and 
lobbyists 
the measure creates the new positions of chief financial officer 
for the department and comptroller of the federal housing 
administration to oversee financial management it includes 
reforms in the fhainsured mortgage program including a 
prohibition on loans for second homes 
the bill includes restrictions on the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program which provided subsidies for renovating 
lowincome housing that were at the heart of evidence of 
influencepeddling and political favoritism in the scandals the 
bill limits the number of housing units which may be subsidized per 
project to 100 
it also authorizes 25 million for the department to monitor and 
evaluate its programs less than the 05 percent of program 
spending or about 100 million that kemp asked for 
the bill also includes provisions aimed at ensuring that housing 
assistance grants are distributed without political favoritism it 
requires allocation on the basis of formulas and need and requires 
that the department consider any lowincome housing tax credits 
that may also be available to developers receiving grants 
it requires full disclosure of financin decisions and places 
restrictions on accounts from which the secretary has discretion to 
spend 
in the case of the community development block grants it 
increases form 60 percent to 75 percent the amount of assistance 
that must be used for projects benefiting the poor kemp had 
proposed an even tighter requirement 
the bill also restricts the administrations ability to fire the 
departments inspector general

the house education and labor committee voted 
unanimously tuesday to approve a bill guaranteeing a wide range of 
rights to disabled americans the first house panel to approve the 
measure since the senate passed it in september 
three other house committees must approve the bill judiciary 
energy and commerce and public works and transportation 
the version approved tuesday was virtually the same as the 
senate measure which passed 768 some clarifications were added 
to the bill which prevents discrimination against the disabled in 
employment public accommodations public transportation and access 
to telephone service 
the clarifications were the result of bipartisan negotiations 
just as the senate bill was the result of negotiations with the 
white house which had sought to soften timetables and enforcement 
provisions 
the house version clarifies that although rehabilitated drug 
users are considered disabled and protected under the act a person 
who currently uses drugs and is otherwise disabled is not protected 
although the vote tuesday was unanimous republicans 
unsuccessfully fought to introduce several amendments reflecting 
concerns of the small business community 
when considering the ability of a business that is part of a 
larger entity to pay for changes required under the law courts may 
consider the financial resources of the overall entity according 
to one of the clarifications 
also the house version says that the maximum fine of 50000 
for violations of the public accommodations provision applies to 
all violations that make up a pattern and practice suit brought 
by the attorney general and not an individual violation second 
violations carry a maximum fine of 100000 under the same standard 
lawmakers had been hoping to have a house version passed and a 
final bill ready for president bushs signature by christmas such 
an outcome appears unlikely given the present pace of hearings

heat according to a poll by a miami tv station with support 
nearly even for sandinista president daniel ortega and usbacked 
candidate violeta chamorro 
univision news pollster suggested that a position by the roman 
catholic church which has suffered years of harassment from the 
sandinistas could tip the election 
in the poll which was taken at the end of october ortega 
received 40 percent and chamorro 39 percent 
eight other candidates got a total of 5 percent and 16 percent 
of the sample of 1129 voters said it was undecided the poll had a 
margin of plus or minus 3 percent 
the poll is the first independently sponsored poll among voters 
registered for the feb 25 election that challenges the rule of the 
marxistleaning sandinistas who have held power since toppling 
dictator anastasio somoza in july 1979

united states a friend whereas the soviet union and cuba received 
respective friendship rankings of 66 percent and 70 percent 
the us governmentbacked contra fighters seeking to topple the 
sandinistas also got acrosstheboard low ratings 
he said the numbers tended to hold up even among those who 
oppose the sandinistas 
the poll said miguel cardinal obando y bravo the head of 
nicaraguas roman catholic church had a favorable rating of 67 
percent and that among the undecided voters it was nearer 80 
percent 
that 16 percent may look to the cardinal for an indirect 
signal if he decides to sent one bendixen said 
the company has done preelection polls in eight other countries 
since 1984 and never missed by more than 3 percent except where 
there were widespread allegations of irregularities

sandinistas for what they have done since 1979 and 39 percent had a 
negative opinion

will be honest and 27 percent predict fraud

leftwing rebels on tuesday 
claimed control of portions of eight of el salvadors 14 provinces 
and declared they would intensify efforts to seize the entire 
country 
president alfredo cristiani said his government is not and was 
never threatened by the fierce 3dayold guerrilla offensive that 
has turned the capital into a battlefield 
government aircraft rocketed and strafed rebel positions on the 
northern and eastern perimeters of san salvador and thousands of 
residents fled the battle zones 
at least 503 people have been killed and more than 1000 wounded 
across el salvador since the guerrillas launched their offensive 
saturday night according to military hospital and morgue reports 
the rebels farabundo marti national liberation front fmln 
issued a communique calling on its forces to take control of the 
whole country but also said it was willing to pursue a 
democratic solution it said local governments would be 
established in areas held by the rebels 
cristiani a rightist who took office june 1 said government 
forces have neutralized insurgents on san salvadors 
southeastern southern and western periphery but that combat 
continues against rebels on the northern outskirts 
the army is advancing but advancing slowly he told a news 
conference he accused the guerrillas of holding civilians hostage 
and of using them as screens against army counteroffensives 
the government was never in danger he said the people 
stated clearly and out loud that they were not going to support the 
fmln there is no danger whatever of the government being 
toppled 
the degree of civilian support for the rebels who have 
entrenched themselves in several northern and eastern workingclass 
suburbs is difficult to gauge 
reporters have witnessed what appears to be respectful even 
amicable treatment of the insurgents including the giving of 
food water and intelligence but it is unclear if the civilians 
feel coerced by the presence of hundreds of heavily armed 
combatants in their neighborhoods 
cristiani denied air force planes and helicopters had bombarded 
civilian zones where the guerrillas are entrenched 
but gen humberto larios minister of defense virtually 
contradicted the president when at the same news conference he 
acknowledged that helicopters have fired rockets at guerrilla 
positions 
associated press reporters and photographers in northern and 
eastern sections of the city were able to visit rebelheld zones 
and saw air attacks 
nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 wounded 
in this capital since the fighting began many of them reportedly 
casualties of air attacks thousands of others have fled the battle 
zones 
us ambassador william walker told an afternoon news conference 
in the capital it is not a situation that is any means stable as 
yet 
he said the fmln was pulling out all the stops in the 
offensive but failing to achieve either its political or military 
objectives 
rebels with light antitank weapons attacked a national police 
unit near his residence during the night but they were repelled by 
troops walker said 
a guerrilla leader who uses the pseudonym carlos argueta said 
its a new kind of war that could lead to the end of the war 
he spoke with ap in a rebelcontrolled district in the capitals 
northern neighborhood of zacamil 
fmln leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they would 
not participate in peace talks sceduled for nov 2021 in caracas 
venezuela they said cristianis rightist government was not 
negotiating seriously and blamed it for the oct 31 bombing of a 
union headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29 two 
americans were among the wounded 
el salvador is under a rebeldeclared traffic ban a state of 
siege and 6 pm6 am curfew the army ordered a 24hour curfew 
on embattled districts in san salvador 
ussupplied skymaster propeller planes were seen firing 
rockets at residential areas in zacamil and in soyapango an 
eastern suburb of the capital 
helicopter gunships strafed rebelheld positions some 
neighborhoods were sealed off by government troops but in other 
districts there were only rebel units 
in zacamil where fivestory apartment buildings rise above 
squatters shacks the fmln contingent was led by claudio 
rabindranath armijo who uses the war name commander chico 
some fighters were as young as 13 carrying ak47 assault 
rifles armijo was accompanied by a onearmed communications 
officer with a field radio 
although the rebels military domination of zacamil was solid 
their political control was not 
hundreds perhaps thousands of residents remained in the 
neighborhood aiding the guerrillas but hundreds of others fled 
the community 
armijo said rebel commanders were trying to persuade the people 
to support them but those who didnt were free to leave 
col arturo lopez an armed forces spokesman described the 
residents of northern suburbs as hostages of terrorist elements 
he said as of tuesday morning 309 guerrillas had been killed 
160 wounded and 60 captured he gave military casualties as 106 
killed and 231 wounded 
lopez said the military had counted 17 civilians killed and 86 
wounded throughout the couuntry but hospitals and morgues reported 
88 civilians killed and 662 wounded only in san salvador since the 
offensive began 
in a broadcast on the rebels clandestine radio venceremos the 
fmln declared parts of eight provinces liberated zones it said 
local governments would be established in areas of chalatenango 
morazan san miguel la union usulutan cuscatlan san vicente and 
cabanas provinces the guerrillas have controlled areas in those 
provinces for years 
fmln leaders have said in the past they could not expect a 
battlefield victory over the usbacked government they have an 
estimated 7000 guerrillas and 11000 irregulars fighting the 
governments 56000member security forces 
the salvadoran conflict has taken 70000 lives the last decade

the chairman of the house education and labor 
committee gave george bush failing marks as the education 
president tuesday and accused him of blocking the education 
secretary from doing a good job 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif acknowledged to reporters at 
the national press club i feel rather presumptive in grading the 
president but ive been asked to do so he then launched into 
harsh criticisms of bush who pledged to become the education 
president if elected 
there is not a single accomplishment initiative or 
educational credit with which the president can be identified even 
if the summit is so regarded said hawkins referring to the 
recent twoday meeting of bush and the nations governors that 
resulted in a push for national performance goals 
however hawkins was kinder to education secretary lauro 
cavazos noting he and i are very very friendly 
i think hes a fine honorable man i think he has good 
motives said hawkins i think that if he was not restrained 
he probably would do very well i think under the restraints he 
cant 
hawkins said that cavazos is being hampered by policies pushed 
by the office of management and budget and the white house which 
i think differ diametrically from his own philosophy 
i think hes trying to do a good job in a very desperate sort 
of way but will not be able to succeed because he has to accept the 
policies of the administration said hawkins who predicted 
cavazos would not complete his term at the department of education 
asked about concrete accomplishments of cavazos hawkins said 
i dont know of any 
replying to hawkins cavazos said in a statement the remarks 
made are unfounded and the allegations misleading at a time when 
the national urgently needs a constructive dialogue between the 
administration and the congress 
the president knows that this nation faces a dangerous 
education deficit and we are determined to directly confront the 
gravity of the situation business as usual will not suffice 
the president and i have proposed a farreaching education 
agenda for this nation we have invigorated the education debate 
across this country i take great honor and consider it a 
privilege to serve president bush 
as for bush hawkins said i am afraid the presidents record 
is an embarrassing 0 for 4 he pointed to the administrations 
efforts to push the concept of allowing parents toselect the school 
their children will attend even though parental choice has not 
been adequately debated legislated or evaluated 
the administration is promoting choice to replace full funding 
and implementation of current federal elementary and secondary 
education programs as embodied in the school improvement act of 
1988 he said 
hawkins also cited bushs veto of the education appropriations 
bill which he said would have enabled 1 million additional 
disadvantaged children to improve their reading and math skills 
bush vetoed the legislation because it contained an expansion of 
abortion funding that he opposed 
the california democrat also criticized bush for excluding from 
the summit educators members of congress and representatives from 
business teachers and parents

the foreign ministry on tuesday objected to 
us plans to deploy marines near the usmexican border in 
antidrug operations 
the mexican government wants to make clear that it does not 
share in nor support the measures announced yesterday monday 
by the us defense department regarding the use of the armed 
forces in a location close to the shared border the ministry 
said 
washington announced on monday the formation of a military 
intelligence center at fort bliss near el paso texas that reports 
said would use 75 us marines in border drugpatrol operations el 
paso is across the border from the mexican city of ciudad juarez 
the foreign ministry statement said the us and mexican 
governments have established effective cooperation in the war 
against drugs but washingtons decision made unilaterally 
could have negative repercussions along the border it did not 
elaborate on the possible effects 
the mexican government recognizes the sovereign right of all 
nations to institute measures in accord with their national 
interests in their respective territories the statement said 
however the mexican government believes that among neighbors 
especially in friendly countries mutual consultation is prudent 
for both sides

the senate approved a bill tuesday making 
pennsylvanias abortion laws the toughest in the nation as the 
first state to take advantage of greater authority allowed by the 
supreme court 
the bill approved on a 3317 vote and passed three weeks ago by 
the house goes to the house leadership wednesday for a formal 
signature then to democratic gov robert p casey who has said he 
would sign it 
prochoice forces introduced nine amendments in an attempt to 
delay its passage and soften its effects but all the amendments 
were defeated within five hours and the legislation was approved 
about half an hour later 
its a big win its a big margin its great said rep 
stephen freind the republican who drafted the bill and guided it 
through the house 
prochoice senators said the legislation would trample on 
womens rights while setting the stage for another court challenge 
to abortion 
its a shame a national disgrace said sen vincent fumo a 
democrat the bill would require women to notify their husbands if 
they plan to get an abortion prohibit abortions because of the 
fetus sex ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except 
in cases where the mother faces death or irreversible harm and 
establish a 24hour waiting period 
the proposal also would regulate the medical use of tissue from 
aborted fetuses doctors would be required to inform a woman of the 
likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain 
the risks and alternatives 
the bill was approved just two weeks after voters in new jersey 
and virginia elected governors who succeeded in winning their races 
partly because of their prochoice positions both candidates made 
abortion a campaign issue 
last month an attempt by florida gov bob martinez to restrict 
abortion fell flat when the legislature rejected a package of bills 
the senate debate was suspended less than half an hour after it 
began when legislators voted 2624 to suspend rules and allow 
amendments republican and democratic caucuses held private 
meetings on the bill 
debate resumed two hours later an amendment to make a technical 
change and another to allow some exceptions to a proposed ban on 
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy were the first to be 
defeated 
other rejected amendments included proposals for a statewide 
referendum on the bill eliminating a requirement that wives notify 
husbands before ending a pregnanacy and revising the waiting period 
so that women living at least 50 miles from a clinic would have to 
make only one trip 
had any of the amendments passed the legislation would have 
been returned to the house which would have had to agree to any 
changes 
at noon the capitol rotunda was filled with more than 100 
antiabortion protesters who held a prayer vigil and sang religious 
songs the vigil was organized by members of a home for unwed 
mothers 
the state chapter of the national organization for women 
delivered petitions to the governors office with 50000 signatures 
and handwritten letters opposing further restrictions on abortion 
in a july decision upholding a missouri law the supreme court 
gave states more leeway to restrict abortions if the pennsylvania 
bill is enacted it would be first to take advantage of that ruling 
by setting tighter controls on abortion 
opponents of the bill have described it as unconstitutional 
supporters say the bill places reasonable restrictions on 
abortions while providing an avenue for further challenges to the 
landmark roe vs wade decision that established abortion a 
constitutional right in 1973

and bolster enforcement could result in a taxpayerfunded bailout 
dwarfing the recent savings and loan crisis 
theres an insidious and steady siphoning off which 
ultimately affects the employees says raymond maria acting 
inspector general for the labor department i am convinced there 
is substantial fraud and abuse 
an associated press investigation found that at least onefourth 
of the private pension plans audited by the government are in 
violation of the law yet the odds of any individual program being 
checked are less than one in a hundred

the military wants more land for war games 
in four western states but hunters ranchers and environmentalists 
see its plans as a land grab twice the size of massachusetts that 
menaces wildlife and farming 
four separate proposals by different branches of the armed 
services would expand areas for training with tanks warplanes and 
artillery by 16800 square miles in unconnected areas in montana 
idaho utah and nevada 
the pentagon says the proposals to add military training to uses 
allowed on the federally owned land arent part of a coordinated 
effort but environmentalists say congress rejected a similar 
national program in 1974 
its too coincidental to be a coincidence said charles

levels and even heightening their risk of heart disease a study 
suggests 
researchers have long suspected but never proven that caffeine 
the chemical that gives coffee its jolt was somehow involved in 
heart trouble 
the study raises the possibility that coffee without caffeine 
could be the real villain 
the research conducted at stanford university found that 
people who went from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels

at a distance or up close it looks like a 
tall indian tepee it was designed that way but its a church it 
has served its congregation for nearly 40 years but its day seems 
done 
in this state named for the red people the unusual but 
aptly shaped structure built to reflect its natural environment 
may be destined for eradication due to blows by nature itself 
we realize its a landmark says connie golden the church 
secretary we hate to see it go but weve been frustrated in 
maintaining it the leaking the flooding the special problems in 
repairs all kinds of things 
the upkeep was simply phenomenal 
the tepee church once called the wigwam stands on the citys 
northwestern outskirts at 178th and macarthur boulevard on the 
boundary with suburban edmond and its outlying oil derricks 
formerly a southern baptist church it became nondenominational 
about five years ago called simply the church at edmond early 
this fall slammed variously by the elements the congregation 
moved out 
new folks like the uniqueness of it and older folks have a lot 
of sentiment about it but they see the impracticalities of 
maintaining it says the pastor the rev john ward 
people who understand the problem who have lived with that 
thing know why we have to give it up he added in an interview 
we get mad at it sometimes 
built in the late 1940s the tepee was designed by the late 
innovative architect bruce goff chairman of the university of 
oklahoma school of architecture from 1947 to 1955 and planner of 
several striking buildings 
it stands about 80 feet tall height of a fourstory building 
its conical shape converging in a peak the sloping grayshingled 
surface surmounted by 12 russetpainted steel poles welded 
drillstem pipes from the oil fields 
they were named for the 12 apostles lore has it that the one 
named for the betrayer judas was hardest to erect their 
convergence at the top is enclosed by 12 triangular windows above 
rises legs of an open bell tower with no bell 
the base is wrapped with native rock and sheet metal over a 
circular basement for nursery and classrooms the round sanctuary 
with pews ringed before the raised podium was a precursor of later 
churchesintheround 
constructed by members themselves working saturdays and weekday 
evenings over four years from 1947 to 1951 the oddly formed church 
was meant to express its natural setting indians oil fields and 
rural touches 
back then the design was pretty controversial recalled 
ward who was a young boy in the tepees early days climbing 
with other church children among its interior nooks rocks and 
webbed braces 
but the people then evidently went for it he added 
however for all its fittingly novel features it just didnt 
function well the strange peak with its merging poles and 
triangular windows at the apex always leaked some ward says 
little or much depending on the rains force 
oklahomas extra rains last summer multiplied the trouble 
dousing basement rooms the runoff infiltrating the septic system 
the building had no insulation and in the winter couldnt be 
warmed above 50 degrees ward said 
utilities were out of sight he added we couldnt afford 
to heat it or cool it in repairs youre not dealing with the 
average building but always with different sizes and spaces 
theres nothing standard about it 
id love to see the building saved but we just cant do 
anything with it 
the congregation of about 200 has moved its worship services 
into an adjacent metal building with sanctuary and fellowship 
hall and a concreteblock education building 
since word of the tepees evacuation got out some historical 
conservationists including some from other countries have voiced 
interest in saving it but no definite plans for that have emerged 
ward said that unless some foundation or group acts to preserve 
the tepee he anticipated that it would be torn down within a 
year and the space used as a church parking lot 
yet some both in the congregation and outside it remain attached 
to the tepee despite the inroads of nature sometimes 
including birds fluttering about inside 
when you get accustomed to it the uniqueness of it people 
generally love it ward said the wider community also is proud 
of it and hates to see it go but he added that its so different 
it doesnt work 
it expands and contracts so much he said its 
inefficient in a lot of other ways theres no big burning desire 
to tear it down but we dont know what else to do with it

the outlook for business conditions improved 
substantially in the latest quarterly survey of small businesses 
suggesting that economic growth could be surprisingly strong for 
the rest of the year 
the survey found unexpected strength in job creation and an 
improvement in the inflation picture during the third quarter but 
only slight improvement in shortterm borrowing conditions 
william c dunkelberg who interprets results for the national 
federation of independent business said responses leave the threat 
of recession something that at best is likely to occur only in 
the murky 1990 future 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business and 
management said the survey revealed more companies now expect 
improved economic conditions over the next six months than expect a 
deterioration 
the more confident tone of the report showed up clearly in what 
the federation calls its small business optimism index which rose 
from 998 in the third quarter to 1021 points in the latest 
analysis 
the index which uses 1978 as its benchmark 100 incorporates 
responses about existing and anticipated business conditions 
as such it measures responses about current job openings 
satisfaction with the condition of inventories changes in net 
earnings plans to hire and make capital outlays expected business 
conditions and expected sales 
the lowest seasonally adjusted index since its formulation in 
1974 was an 811 reading in the second quarter of 1980 its highest 
level was reached in the first quarter of 1984 at 1087 
the index which is widely followed because of its sound 
forecasting record over the years relies on detailed written 
responses from close to 2000 members of the federation in the 
latest survey 1797 responses were studied 
the federation claims over 500000 member firms ranging from 
extremely small enterprises such as proprietorships to companies 
with sales in the hundreds of millions small only in relationship 
to the very largest firms 
the community it represents says dunkelberg employs half the 
private nonfarm work force and produces about 50 percent of the 
nations gross private product 
smaller companies it is felt by some economic forecasters are 
especially sensitive to changing economic conditions 
studying the responses dunkelberg said that only 25 percent of 
companies in the survey planned to raise prices a 5point drop 
from the first quarter of 1989 a remarkable turnaround in 
inflation pressures in the economy 
he saw little inflation threat in the strong demand for workers 
saying there is still little evidence that compensation is 
responding in any substantive way to labor market tightness 
while labor costs are rising he said the gains arent 
alarming indeed gains remain surprisingly modest he said 
while conceding that a higher minimum wage could have a ripple 
effect on the wage structure 
the tightening of labor markets shown by the latest survey was 
in contrast to what dunkelberg said was a period of substantial 
weakening since january he termed the strength unexpected and 
said much of it was in the service sector 
little change was found in plans for capital investments all 
in all no excitement just steady spending he said but he 
indicated that it might begin easing soon 
that easing he said would result from companies waiting to see 
just which course the economy is taking so far the signals 
remain mixed and the economy stays on an even keel

americans foresee fewer smokers better schools 
and more cash in their wallets in the coming decade but they 
expect pollution crime and drug abuse to worsen a national poll 
has found 
on balance most respondents to the media generalassociated 
press poll expressed general optimism for the 1990s about six in 
10 expected life for others to improve and threequarters saw 
their own lives getting better 
education was the brightest spot with 58 percent expecting it 
to improve in the next decade personal wealth also was a point of 
optimism with 56 percent expecting their familys financial 
situation to improve 
but the polls 1071 respondents divided about evenly on whether 
the us economy will improve worsen or remain about the same and 
half expected the federal budget deficit to worsen while just a 
fifth saw it improving 
the survey found sobering assessments on many other issues more 
than six in 10 expected pollution and crime to worsen and almost 
as many saw more aids homelessness and world hunger as the year 
2000 approaches 
the environment stood out as a chief concern twelve percent 
expected pollution to be the nations greatest problem a decade 
from now only drug abuse was named by more 17 percent 
moreover 65 percent expected pollution to worsen in the next 10 
years and almost half said the warming of the atmosphere because 
of pollution known as the greenhouse effect could threaten human 
survival 
pessimism often was greatest among younger respondents and in 
many cases optimism increased with age fiftytwo percent of those 
aged 1824 expected the united states to become involved in a war 
in the 1990s just 41 percent of their elders shared their fear 
and among the oldest group over 64 years old just 27 percent 
expected war 
similarly six in 10 in the youngest group expected drug abuse 
to worsen and twothirds of them saw acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome as a growing problem while nearer to half of the older 
respondents agreed 
one of the most widely held expectations overall was for a 
democrat to win the white house which 72 percent called likely 
among the leastexpected developments the demise of communism 
considered likely by just 26 percent 
other widely expected eventualities were cigarette smokers 
shrinking to a tiny minority of the population which 59 percent 
called likely and much greater restrictions on abortion expected 
by 56 percent 
the poll found a lowering of some expectations in the past 
decade in a 1979 survey by the roper organization 51 percent 
expected the fourday work week to become common in the 1980s when 
the question was repeated in the new poll just 41 percent held 
that view for the 1990s 
fewer people expected new energy sources to end dependency on 
oil 49 percent now compared with 60 percent in 1979 and more 
expected the role of nuclear power to decline 45 percent now 
compared with 33 percent 10 years ago 
more also were dubious that racial and religious discrimination 
could largely disappear 77 percent said not compared with 66 
percent in 1979 in both polls nine in 10 doubted that poverty 
would be almost eliminated 
among other possibilities posed for the 1990s 37 percent said 
it was likely the republican party would control congress 38 
percent expected a woman to be elected president 42 percent called 
it likely us astronauts will reach mars and 42 percent expected 
cures for cancer and for aids

shes hip shes brutally honest often 
bawdy and always witty 
poet maralyn lois polak writes about personal pain but says the 
real point of her writing is to reveal global pain cosmic pain 
and human pain 
she published her first poem an ode to jack frost at the age 
of 7 in a local newspaper and has been seriously writing poetry 
since she was 15 since 1974 shes written a weekly celebrity 
interview column for the philadelphia inquirer 
polak who grew up in long branch nj is from a strictly 
workingclass background 
my father was a high school dropout who became an electrical 
engineer she says my parents didnt go to museums or 
concerts they were jewish and revered the idea of learning they 
were smart but not intellectual 
when her father took his lunch to work he carried the new york 
daily news in his box instead of a thermos 
i learned about sex and life from tabloid newspapers she 
says 
she attended temple university on a scholarship 
when she broke into journalism she faced her first battle with 
envy 
everyone went to harvard and yale and radcliffe and i 
developed a crushing inferiority complex it was the worst 
insecurity i ever had and i couldnt do a thing about it she 
says 
that feeling passed when her poetry was noticed by a publisher 
looking for a poet with workingclass roots 
i was cured of my ivy envy she says i realized that 
people who went to great schools werent necessarily happier or 
better educated than i was 
writing about personal pain or hangnails of the soul as 
she calls it is trivial but writing about human pain is more 
important its not enough to write about whats going on around 
you she says 
some poets she says face problems with the mundaneness of life 
and their own selfabsorption 
your material is limited unless youre always listening to the 
voices of other people she says 
the academic world of poetry also bothers her 
poems have to be accessible and written in the language of the 
people she says i dont like academic anything i want my 
work to be multilayered but direct and eloquent not 
pretentious 
her poems deal with politics injustice sex and relationships 
but she doesnt consciously write about those issues one of the 
reasons i write is to give voice to the voiceless to express the 
unspeakable sometimes you write for yourself sometimes you write 
about the larger human condition 
polaks inner struggles also manifest themselves in her writing 
i struggle with the unequal balance of power between people 
she says that sums up everything men and women countries 
governments 
her concerns are also personal 
i worry about why didnt that man call me back she 
laughs but when her father was left alone at the age of 82 after 
her mother died and a relative contracted aids her concerns 
changed 
i worry about what will happen to people with aids to old 
people she says i worry about what it means to be a good 
daughter and a good human being about where does one persons 
struggle end and another persons begin about the limits of 
responsibility 
she rages that american society is unaware of important issues 
were asleep in america the middle class has conquered were 
numb were being entertained and horrible things are happening 
everywhere she says 
journalism reflects that apathy with the emphasis the media 
place on lifestyle stories she says 
thats how our lives have become she says those are 
nonstories about nonissues theyre about nonpeople going to 
nonevents and having nonthoughts 
poetry however should wake people up she says 
i want a poem to come up to you grab you by the throat put a 
gun to your head and say pay attention to me if people become 
safe and smug we have to shake em up a little 
such works as the death squad in philadelphia which 
compares a mythical death squad similar to those in latin american 
countries existing in philadelphia and a tastefully clean poem 
for the ayatollah jesse helms a work against censorship that 
literally blanks out its obscene words but is still obscene 
reflect her more jarring poems 
her poetry and her journalism have to be kept separate she 
says the two do fertilize and enrich each other im better as a 
poet because of my zest for detail and my writing as a journalist 
is more vibrant because of my ability to take risks with words 
the rewards she gains from both also differ 
the reward of poetry is the poem the reward of journalism is 
being part of peoples daily lives

from small rice farms in mazatepec to 
vast fields in fertile valleys mexican agriculture is withering in 
the winds of economic crisis 
the crisis is very real and its a very serious crisis said 
david barkin an agricultural economist with the ecodevelopment 
center in mexico city 
it is affecting all the basic food producers in this country 
it isnt profitable 
that is acutely evident to gonzalo pineda toledo who grows rice 
on 37 acres in mazatepec 45 miles south of mexico city to get 
through the last growing season he had to borrow the equivalent of 
469 and still wound up with a 142 loss on his crop 
a farm union leader said such losses or lean profits have 
encouraged some farmers to plant more profitable but illegal 
marijuana and opium poppies 
one of the few bright spots however has been exports mostly 
of tomatoes other vegetables and fruits to the united states 
which amounted to about 24 billion in 1988 
to broaden that market the mexican government has asked the 
united states to lower barriers to a range of agricultural products 
from avocadoes to watermelons despite possible objections from us 
producers 
after powering the countrys growth for 20 years agriculture 
overall faded into the shadow of industrialization and urbanization 
in the mid1960s the population doubled to 85 million today but 
food production hasnt kept up to avoid shortages more grains 
meat and other foods are imported 
city dwellers eat tortillas made from us yellow corn and 
mexico is the worlds largest importer of powdered milk 
the decline has worsened in the last seven years austerity 
imposed to help service mexicos 107 billion foreign debt and an 
even larger domestic debt has dried up investment 
everyone has suffered agriculture has suffered more said 
kenneth shwedel an agricultural economist and regional director in 
mexico city for the american soybean association 
dam and irrigationsystem construction has stalled cracks and 
pumps arent repaired financing for research to improve crops 
livestock and technology has dwindled along with farm credit 
crop prices have been held within antiinflation guidelines to 
calm urban consumers while interest rates and prices of 
fertilizer insecticides and equipment have ballooned the interest 
on ricefarmer pineda toledos 469 loan was 391 and was a key 
factor in his loss 
far to the northwest in the rich yaqui valley bernabe arana 
rodriguez who manages several agroindustrial cooperatives says 
many soybean farmers didnt plant this year because of low farm 
prices 
i read what the president said that prices werent going up 
and costs are going up so i didnt want to plant he said 
his 70 acres lay idle 
the immediate financial problems overlie deeper ones the 
uncertainty of land tenure under mexicos agrarian reform system 
and corruption and bureaucratic snarls in everything from who gets 
the land to water rights credit and marketing 
in the mexican countryside we are facing the greatest 
challenge of economic modernization president carlos salinas de 
gortari said in his state of the nation address nov 1 
in 1988 crop production shrank 45 percent the third 
consecutive year or reduced or flat production according to the 
bank of mexico this year is expected to be no better analysts 
say the figure contrasts with an average annual growth rate of 61 
percent from 1940 to 1960 
food imports which amounted to 85 million tons last year are 
expected to reach 95 million tons this year and again in 1990 
production of basic grains is expected to be around 22 million tons 
analysts put the cost of imports at 25 billion to 35 billion 
in longterm low interest loans more than the government will 
save in its debt reduction agreement with foreign banks 
as for the farmer two serious things are happening said 
francisco javier gil a leader of the national union of regional 
autonomous campesino organizations they are leaving land 
unplanted and some are planting illegal drugs this is profitable 
another campesino leader said that in the pacific coast state of 
guerrero 25 acres of corn can bring in 400 for five months 
work while onehundredth of that area planted in marijuana 
produces 3000 to 4000 planted in opium poppies it would bring 
20000 
seventy percent of mexicos cultivated land is in ejidos 
farmland given to groups of peasants to work and pass on to their 
children selling it is illegal so is renting although it is 
common 
critics of the ejido system blame it for low production saying 
that the land has been broken up into miniplots and that private 
land ownership offers more incentives and results in more 
investment as well as reduced corruption 
government officials say salinas policy of selling publicly 
held companies wontt extend to the ejido system a fundamental 
reform of the 191021 mexican revolution but they have said 
miniplots should be avoided 
defenders of the system say that with good land and inputs 
ejidos produce as well as private holdings 
the disappearance of the ejido would lead to a reconcentration 
of land and an increase in unemployment migration to the cities 
and to the united states said agricultural economist jose luis 
calva

people in kabul got a taste recently 
of what winter might bring this year and they didnt like it 
moslem guerrillas fighting the government closed the main road 
to the soviet union for 10 days sending food and fuel prices up 
almost 50 percent in the capital sugar and cooking oil disappeared 
from the markets cars vanished from the streets 
on the 10th day government forces reopened the salang highway 
and trucks rolled in with flour and gasoline 
but the lesson was not lost on what most likely in store for the 
cold snowy months ahead 
its going to be a tough time worse than last year said 
mohammad hakim president of the afghanistan chamber of commerce 
ross mountain head of the united nations development program in 
kabul said if the war goes on poor people could starve 
last winter a bustling black market blossomed around the soviet 
military troops sold fuel and flour to afghans and some afghans 
made small fortunes trafficking in soviet arms bought from the 
soldiers eager for foreign currency 
still many people spent their days cold and hungry in a city 
blanketed in snow 
in february the soviet troops went home and with them went an 
important source of goods and cash 
now despite a soviet aid program that in six months has sent 
266543 metric tons of goods overland and thousands more by air 
the economy is getting worse as winter closes in 
prices are already higher than they were in february a bad sign 
since food costs in afghanistan are traditionally lower in autumn 
when it is harvested a 15pound sack of flour has almost doubled 
to the equivalent of 4 and by the end of winter merchants 
estimate it could hit 10 which is more than many people earn in 
a month 
sugar another staple in the afghan diet also has skyrocketed 
to more than 1 a pound tea the third most important item has 
tripled in price 
women defy the 10 pm3 am curfew and spend nights outside 
bakeries to ensure a loaf or two of bread in the morning 
i am poor said one elderly woman as she fixed her straw 
mattress outside one store as the curfew approached my husband 
and i need to eat and there is no other way to get bread 
despite the inflated prices salaries remain low 
the average monthly wage hovers between 5 and 1250 
for many in kabul desperation has become a way of life 
omari mir ahmad runs a photo shop in a small house with mud 
walls in the old city his whole family works in the shop and they 
make about 45 a month 
because they run a private bsiness the family receives no 
government assistance 
ive got seven mouths to feed ahmad said motioning around 
his room suddenly darkened by one of kabuls frequent blackouts 
how will i get by 
at kabul university a student wearing florescent pink lipstick 
and bright white shoes told of her two brothers who were killed by 
a rocket as they flew their kites 
tell the united states and russia to send two big bombs to 
blow us up all at once she said we are sick of dying in bits 
and bits and pieces let us die together 
since rocket attacks were stepped up in june zahir tanin a 
prominent editor has barely allowed his children out of the house 
so far about 400 people have been killed 
when i look into their eyes it is difficult for me to bear 
it he said we are losing a generation this is the sorrow of 
afghanistan 
if there is hope here perhaps it resides in the traditional 
center of life the bazaar 
there men with brown weathered faces gray beards green eyes 
and turbans on their heads hawk dried yogurt grapes and succulent 
melons 
behind a row of buildings lies the grain market in one corner 
sits mohammad nair a grizzled merchant 
the governmnt is coming to us on its knees he said they 
say they need our help only the bazaar will feed the people 
communism has failed 
in the past few months the government has returned an 
unprecedented amount of economic power to the market in an effort 
to bring food to afghanistan it ended a monopoly on the 
transportation of fuel and sugar relaxed already feeble currency 
trading regulations and dropped import restrictions and tariffs 
anything can be bought in kabul by those with money to pay for 
them portable tape players from japan italian leather goods 
soviet and iranian caviar expensive french perfumes and tea from 
china many goods are reexported through the black market to 
pakistan india and iran which have tighter import controls 
in addition the government has gone so far as to assure 
traffickers who bring stolen goods to market that they should not 
fear prosecution 
since all this is aimed at peaceful activity then we support 
it said mayor abdul hakim misaq of kabul it is better than 
rockets 
but then as he spoke the first heavy snows had settled on the 
mountains ringing his city

were it not for one violent day 
in 1985 evelina de bruin would be like countless other black south 
african women an illiterate maid in her 50s raised in a isolated 
farming district mother of 10 
today she is the only woman on death row alone confused and 
ill her prison cell in pretoria is the farthest shes ever been 
from home 
she cannot eat she cant sleep said her lawyer andrea 
durbach of cape town its a very dramatic thing to say but i 
used to think to myself that shes just going to die of a broken 
heart 
mrs de bruin and 13 men were sentenced to death in may for the 
mob killing in november 1985 of a black policeman lucas sethwala 
in paballelo the black section of the remote northwestern town of 
upington 
twentysix people were tried for the killing and four men were 
found to have physically contributed to the death of sethwala who 
was chased from his home stoned beaten and set afire 
in addition to those four mrs de bruin and nine others were 
convicted of murder under the doctrine of common purpose which 
holds them responsible because they were part of the crowd that 
sought to kill sethwala 
sethwalas death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest 
hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at a 
soccer field in paballelo to protest rent increases and other 
grievances 
after police dispersed the crowd with tear gas about 300 people 
regrouped around sethwalas home and threw stones to force him 
outside 
militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen 
accusing them of collaborating with the government and its 
apartheid policies 
mrs de bruin and her commonlaw husband who also has been 
sentenced to death were identified as having thrown stones at 
sethwalas house according to the states evidence she allegedly 
yelled the dog is in the house bring him out and burn him 
alive 
mrs de bruin testified during the trial that she and her 
husband went back to their own house after the protest meeting was 
broken up and were not present at sethwalas home 
mrs de bruin who had no previous criminal record and worked 
for the same white family for 30 years has little understanding of 
what is happening to her ms durbach said 
mrs de bruin suffers from arthritis heart disease and has high 
blood pressure the lawyer said she does not know in what city her 
prison is and thinks shes been imprisoned for at least a year 
when in fact it has been six months 
she sees her husband for 30 minutes once a month they are 
separated by a window and communicate through microphones only 
three of her 10 children have been able to visit her ms durbach 
said 
because she cannot read and is too ill to exercise mrs de 
bruin does little but listen to governmentrun radio that is piped 
into her cell said ms durbach who visits her every three weeks 
she has been treated well by the prison staff and has developed 
a good relationship with one of the guards ms durbach added 
a judge ruled in september that the 14 people sentenced to death 
could appeal their sentences but a bail request for mrs de bruin 
was turned down 
two psychologists testified at her bail application that she had 
suffered mental and physical deterioration including memory loss 
since her imprisonment 
ms durbach said no date has been set for the appeal but she 
hopes it could be early next year 
in a similar mob killing the appeal court the countrys 
highest court last year upheld under the common purpose 
doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the 
sharpeville six 
however after a storm of domestic and international protest 
thenpresident pw botha commuted their death sentences to lengthy 
prison terms 
the last woman to be executed in south africa was sandra smith 
25 who was of mixed race she was hanged in june after being 
convicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of a 
teenager 
more than 50 people mostly black have been executed so far 
this year and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previous 
three years 
botha and his successor fw de klerk have commuted 54 death 
sentences this year

emy bonhoeffer remembers everything about 
the moment in 1945 when she realized her husband klaus would die 
for his involvement in the christian resistance to adolf hitlers 
fascist regime and his extermination of jews 
among 36 people interviewed for a video archive in lynchburg 
she said she was sitting with her husband in the ruins of their 
bombed house in munich when she exhaled a puff of cigarette smoke 
turned to klaus and asked for the first time how will it be when 
you are arrested 
her husbands words as she recounts were it will be like a 
lion passed through and devoured myself and all that i have 
klaus bonhoeffer a member of the confessing church that was 
set up in the crisis by church leaders to resist nazism told her 
she could do nothing to prevent his demise 
she related he said perhaps you can preserve your life and 
our children and if you can let them know that their father did 
not do nothing 
a few months later bonhoeffer and his brother dietrich 
bonhoeffer the renowned theologian and lutheran minister were led 
into the rubble outside a prison and executed on hitlers personal 
orders 
james patrick kelley professor of religious studies at 
lynchburg college spent four years seeking and interviewing 
germans or their relatives who were involved in the christian 
resistance to hitler a generally unknown voice in the wilderness 
of inaction against or collaboration with the nazis 
the collection he has established 200 hours of videotape 
available by mail for researchers and historians was dedicated 
recently at the college elie wiesel a jewish survivor of the 
auschwitz death camp termed the christian resisters to hitler 
righteous gentiles 
kelleys project was financed by seventh street christian church 
in richmond va 
the only other videotape archives in the united states on the 
subject of nazi germany is at yale university where interviews of 
1400 holocaust survivors and witnesses to the atrocities against 
jews are maintained said kelley and joanne rudof project manager 
of the yale collection 
kelley who received his masters degree and doctorate at yale 
said there were two questions for which he sought explanations 
where were the christians during hitlers rise to power why did 
they not prevent the horror of the holocaust 
its important for people to know there was early resistance 
to the hitler regime and hes documenting this rudof said of 
kelley 
on kelleys efforts to explain why most christians turned their 
backs on the jews while a few helped them rudof said its such 
an unresolved question there is still a great bitterness on behalf 
of many jews who ask why didnt they help us more and there are 
some jews who praise the help given to them by christians 
kelley said that at one crucial point in 1934 when hitler had 
not yet consolidated his power 45 percent of the clergy in germany 
were aligned with the confessing church organized specifically to 
oppose his racist regime replete with antisemitic policies 
no other group of professionals followed the example of the 
confessing church and publicly opposed hitler be it lawyers who 
could have decried the arbitrary denial of rights to jews or 
scientists who could have spoken out against the dismissal of 
jewish colleagues kelley said 
kelley said if there had been more public opposition hitlers 
policies could have been modified and the holocaust the systematic 
extermination of 6 million jews that began in 1941 might have been 
prevented in addition to the jews an estimated 5 million other 
people died or were killed in the camps including people branded 
as liberals or opponents to fascism scholars and homosexuals 
but the movement faded and the number of christians involved in 
the resistance dwindled rudof said some pastors went so far as to 
join hitlers secret police 
why did so many christians remain silent different answers 
were given by almost everyone kelley said they said some were 
afraid some ignored the realities behind the propaganda some 
people were preoccupied with personal affairs 
the most eloquent answer kelley said came from renate bethge 
the daughter of an executed christian resister and neice of 
dietrich bonhoeffer 
she said when people know enough to know if they learn more 
it will require some risk then it is surprising how little 
people want to learn 
kelley said he does not want to portray the christian members of 
the resistance as heroes they failed to prevent the holocaust 
world war ii and the destruction of germany at the same time it 
should be remembered that they tried to prevent those kind of 
things they should not be forgotten 
james smylie a professor of church history at union theological 
seminary in richmond said the remaining christian resisters are 
rapidly dying 
kelley gave 36 persons still alive an opportunity to talk 
live on camera about their experiences in those excruciating 
years smylie said their reflections are now part of the 
record which will assist us in reassessing this past and 
understanding our own responsibilities today

mayor ed koch told that mikhail gorbachev and 
his wife raisa were coming for a visit said great invite 
them to dinner ill take them to my favorite chinese restaurant 
while the reaction says something of the mayors natural 
exuberance it also says a great deal of this polyglot city that is 
host to the worlds largest diplomatic corps some 40000 men 
women and children from widely divergent cultures they staff 159 
missions to the united nations and 87 consulates 
if its not easy living with 8 million new yorkers its no 
piece of cake for the new yorkers either 
many of these guests live within the sometime shelter of 
diplomatic immunity their various embassies are considered foreign 
territory immune from the new york police force even city 
inspectors as is the united nations itself and their 1000 cars 
have special areas to park one of their privileges which doesnt 
stop them from parking illegally almost anywhere they choose 
last year 65000 parking violations were issued to cars with 
diplomatic plates down from 154000 a decade earlier an 
indication of better cooperation 
the vienna conventions do specify that the diplomats should 
respect the laws of the host country so diplomatic vehicles can be 
towed to the city pound if they threaten the health and safety but 
unlike everyday new yorkers the erring diplomat can retrieve his 
car without cost in most circumstances 
the city concedes there is not enough diplomatic parking space 
fiftyfive missions and consulates dont have any at all but it is 
the one battlefield where the host new yorkers and their guests 
cross bayonets 
not long ago the mexican ambassador pulled up to his designated 
diplomatic parking spot in front of his residence just as a new 
yorker was backing into it the ambassador asked him to move and he 
wouldnt it heated up from there finally the ambassador pulled a 
gun and won back his parking place 
the person who adjudicates mediates calms the angry waters is 
gillian martin sorensen head of the citys commission for the 
united nations and consular corps she is the wife of ted sorensen 
a new york attorney who served in president john f kennedys white 
house 
their home phone rings at all hours of the night the diplomatic 
911 number seems to be call gillian 
not that it happens every night because it doesnt ms 
sorensen says but it still makes me jump because i know if 
theyre calling at that hour its important they know someone 
will respond 
it can be anything from a bomb threat to a diplomatic suicide or 
a runaway child or a heart attack the daughter of the indian 
ambassador died the other day of an asthma attack in a matter of 
minutes she says 
if its a towed car we let it wait until morning 
for her it is an obvious labor of love i learned how deeply 
diplomats care about their work she says i learned how the 
image of diplomats as highliving socializing stripedpants types 
is far from the truth 
as commissioner she is a sometimes housemother to people who 
are far from home in an alien environment vulnerable 
they have their share of stolen cars stolen car radios even 
stolen license plates a car belonging to bangladesh was hijacked 
at knife point in october ms sorensen points out that the 
redwhiteandblue diplomatic plates make them highly visible 
to counteract this one diplomat put an i love new york 
sticker on his bumper so she made them available to any embassy or 
consulate that wanted them china haiti india jordan the holy 
see and hungary were among the first to order hundreds went out 
new york is not an easy environment 
during the telephone strike there were some 80 calls from 
diplomats who couldnt get their phones installed and were out of 
communication with their home governments 
ms sorensen and her staff of 14 were able on a selective and 
emergency basis to get their phones hooked up 
then there was the time a water main burst and flooded the 
basement of the bulgarian embassy where they keep important files 
the water department responded quickly 
another time the chinese consulate in manhattan called in 
consternation ms sorensen remembers they looked out their 
windows and to their shock there were flaming cars speeding by 
it turned out to be a movie crew filming a chase scene the crew 
had a permit but nobody had notified the chinese world war iii 
is not breaking out she reassured them 
part of her staffs job is to cut through municipal red tape 
provide advice on everything from leases to insurance to child care 
to provisions for the handicapped

over time there have been a sprinkling of minor crimes an 
occasional shoplifting a few assaults usually involving teenage 
sons of diplomats but ms sorensen insists that as a group the 
diplomatic corps is responsible lawabiding 
there is a curious pattern in the parking violations which are 
tracked by computer 
we have a handful who tend to be chronic ms sorensen says 
and then i discovered from friends in london that the worst 
chronic offenders here are by nationality the worst chronic 
offenders there 
it often reflects the attitude toward the law they have at home 
when a new ambassador comes in and cracks down making them pay for 
their own parking tickets even when they are not required to pay 
under international law the parking violations clear up quickly 
diplomatic immunity is a sometimes thing heads of mission and 
their immediate family generally are immune from all local laws 
but as ones grade in post descends ones immunity erodes while 
all of the diplomatic corps are immune to most parking violations 
any violation including those of parking that involve the health 
and safety of the populace and that includes moving violations 
are not covered so parking in front of a hydrant or speeding are 
not in the immunity field except for top diplomats 
even if they didnt have to confront local or state law they 
would have to face various degrees of censure from their home 
states and the united nations for a while debt was a large 
problem so bad that some new york landlords wouldnt rent to 
diplomatic missions probably the premier case involved zaire 
which is not a poor country 
when zairian president mobutu sese seko came to new york on a 
courtesy visit mayor koch received him after some polite 
conversation the head of state asked ms sorensen about zaires 
debt in new york she told him that his nation owed more than 
150000 in rent and other bills 
the president was furious and berated his ambassador and his 
foreign minister who were there she recalls when he heard the 
sum involved he said you come with us when we leave here so i 
took a city hall colleague with me and we went to the presidents 
hotel then and there from suitcases they literally paid us in 
cash bundles of cash 
then there are the political demonstrations on the streets 
weve had occasions when weve had two opposing views the pro 
on this side of the street and the con on that side of the 
street ms sorensen says 
new york gives wide latitude to demonstrators but the police 
firmly enforce the limits broad as they are 
sometimes it bothers the neighbors and sometimes it bothers 
the people in the mission or consulate being picketed ms 
sorensen says we let it be a lesson in democracy a lesson in 
free speech i think that is not a bad lesson they know they are 
in new york in the united states of america they know what the 
rules and regulations are that people can carry any flag they 
like and they can say anything even outrageous things 
they may not like it and it may not be allowed at home but 
those are the rules we go by so they accept it 
its not the only lesson new york teaches the foreign diplomat 
its heartwarming to me to see that the foreigners attitude 
and understanding toward this city and toward democratic society 
does change with time she says they arrive in new york 
somewhat intimidated and afraid of the city our reputation is kind 
of frightening when they leave i find a lot of them love new york 
they love the options they love the rhythm they love the 
diversity and the mix they love the freedoms that we take for 
granted and they leave with regret 
ms sorensen says the new york experience stays with them we 
know that service in new york is an essential step on the career 
ladder of diplomats and the younger the country the younger the 
diplomat the more true it is and well see them again either as 
ambassador or minister or in some cases head of government 
in her dozen years tending to diplomats ms sorensen has seen 
everything from a terrorist assassination to a head of government 
who wanted to hire a chef at the waldorfastoria hotel and take him 
home with him because he liked his pancakes 
the gorbachev visit on dec6 1988 marked the end of frosty and 
somewhat formal relations with the soviet union 
not only was the soviet union changing its historic role and 
becoming active and engaged and constructive in the un but also 
the citizens of new york with construction workers hanging out a 
huge sign that said hard hats welcome gorby it was proof that 
you should never give up that things can change and that 
diplomacy is not just a highfallutin term but a vehicle for that 
change 
a footnote to the gorbachevs quick trip it took 5000 extra 
police to provide security and traffic control for which the city 
was reimbursed 25 million 
when the gorbachevs had to cut short the visit on dec 8 because 
of the armenian earthquake it was a great disappointment to a 
fourthgrade class where raisa gorbachev was to visit the 
8yearolds were all dressed up their welcome sign was up and the 
refreshments were ready this is where it goes beyond diplomacy 
to touch real people and change a view of another power no longer 
an evil empire but somebodys country a people to know and 
understand and to learn about ms sorensen says 
to her the whole experience has been extraordinary 
and sometimes touching when the sultan of brunei arrived to 
celebrate his countrys joining the united nations he asked what 
the city needed he wanted to present a little gift 
of the hundreds of needs in new york ms sorensen named a few 
when the sultan called on the mayor he was about as shy as 
anyone ive ever seen you could hardly hear him he almost spoke 
in a whisper so there was a slightly awkward exchange with the 
mayor then he reached into his pocket and took out his little 
gift it was a check for 500000 made out to meals on wheels

the village of abu tor its stone houses 
spilling down a ravine across from the old walled city of 
jerusalem was once a symbol of arabjewish coexistence 
today after almost two years of the palestinian uprising the 
arab and jewish communities are divided by borders of the heart 
that are difficult to cross even for the sake of simple dialogue 
on many recent nights residents on both sides have been kept 
awake by the sounds of gunfire banging on doors and loudspeaker 
announcements as police hunt for palestinian youths who set fire to 
israeli cars or hurled firebombs at patrols 
abd abu diab a leading figure in the arab sector of abu tor 
one of the few areas of jerusalem where jews and arabs live next to 
each other says one of the successes of the intefadeh or 
uprising has been defining the borders for a proposed palestinian 
state showing israelis where they are welcome and where they are 
not 
i have jewish friends at work but i dont remember anyone 
coming here or me going to their homes says diab an official of 
the arabrun electric company in east jerusalem i ask myself 
why the answer is that there is a border in the heart the jews 
feel like outsiders here 
but the violence that has frightened jews from visiting arab 
areas has made dialogue that much more difficult not only for the 
9000 arabs and 2000 jews in abu tor but for palestinians and 
israelis as a whole 
one of those scared away is maya tavori a grayhaired jewish 
lawyer who lives with her husband oded an engineer in a spacious 
secondfloor apartment on the dividing line between the two sectors 
i used to go down to the village and drink coffee and shop 
now i dont do it any more because its dangerous the police told 
me not to she says 
a supporter of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc she says tough measures used against her arab neighbors were 
upsetting but necessary these included a fourday curfew during 
which televisions radios videocassette recorders and other items 
were seized by revenue agents in lieu of unpaid taxes 
its nice to talk beautifully but we have to take a stand and 
take care of our people she says the arabs are trying to show 
us they will not let us live in peace 
mrs tavori who heads a nearby community center says that 
after several incidents of stone and bottlethrowing the centers 
basketball court and playground were put off limits to arabs 
the jewish sector located at the top of a hill is modern and 
prosperous with parks gardens and playgrounds 
the only visible sign of insecurity is the unusual number of 
german shepherds salukis and other guard dogs 
the arab area is noticeably less welloff it lacks street 
lighting some roads are unpaved garbage goes uncollected and 
there are no playgrounds or parks there are also frequent patrols 
of paramilitary police carrying assault rifles walls are covered 
with antiisraeli slogans 
ahmed abu saloum the father of seven children ranging in age 
from 6 months to 13 years showed a reporter eight holes in his 
front windows that he said were made by rubber bullets

where can we hide he asks noting that the windows do not 
have shutters to protect his family from stray bullets 
abu saloum a lean intense man in his 30s lost his radio 
color tv videocassette player electric fan and typewriter during 
the recent curfew the items were seized in lieu of taxes he had 
refused to pay as part of a civil disobedience campaign 
soon after he spoke an israeli police van with windows screened 
to protect against stonethrowing arrived on naomi street outside 
with heavily armed police walking on either side 
they rousted a group of teenagers and ordered them to clear the 
street of large stones apparently put up as a barricade a reporter 
saw one policeman slap an arab teenager in the back of the head 
while another officer kicked a second youth 
i think it is difficult to make the children understand that 
we can make peace says abu saloum a grocer with a passion for 
amateur theater they see violence and get radical ideas 
nisrin his greeneyed 13yearold daughter says israeli youths 
in abu tor have become openly contemptuous she does not go into 
the jewish area alone 
they think theyre superior she says adding we dont 
want to improve relations we want a state 
eden green a curly haired 17yearold attended three 
palestinianisraeli encounter groups arranged by her mother judith 
she says palestinian demands seem unrealistic and extreme 
particularly those espoused by moslem fundamentalists who argue 
that jews should live as a protected minority in an islamic state 
but i think its important to get to know these people if 
everyone got to know the palestinians as people it would be harder 
to use violence against them she says 
mrs tavori said firebombs and other violence have destroyed the 
feelings of tolerance and coexistence that used to prevail in abu 
tor 
look and see how beautiful it is its been spoiled she 
says gesturing from her balcony at the panoramic view that 
stretches from the landmark golden cap of the dome of the rock 
mosque in the old city to the judean hills and the dead sea beyond 
mrs tavori says she has started a diary to sort out her 
confused and often conflicting reactions to her arab neighbors 
during the uprising that began in december 1987 and has taken the 
lives of more than 590 arabs and 40 israelis 
she recalls for example walking to an arab bakery recently for 
sweet knafy cake a favorite treat before the uprising both she 
and the owner felt uneasy 
we were such good friends but we didnt even smile at each 
other she says reading from the diary 
when she got home she heard on the radio that an israeli woman 
and her two children burned to death on a bus in the west bank 
the cake stuck in my throat and i was sorry i went 
but then walking alone one day she noticed she was being 
followed by an arab man he walked more quickly and i thought 
am i supposed to be afraid then he came up and gave a flower and 
said to a beautiful woman a beautiful flower 
when i tell people the story they dont believe it everyone 
thinks i dreamed it

what do the worlds rapidly receding rain 
forests and other endangered ecological climes have to do with new 
york city or atlanta for that matter or san antonio or rock 
island ill 
all of those cities and many others either have or are planning 
a plant conservatory a kind of sophisticated greenhouse where they 
can nurture specimens of the worlds endangered plant life much as 
zoos protect some endangered animal species 
evie white came all the way to new york where by luck she got a 
lead on 18 acres of land back home in rock island on which to build 
the plant conservatory she has been dreaming of for years 
mrs white and her husband charles a retired schoolteacher 
recently attended a twoday workshop conservatories of the 21st 
century at the brooklyn botanical garden experts attended from 
all over the country for the whites it was a wellspring of 
knowledge 
most conservatories are the crown jewel of a botanical garden 
sometimes they are called the rembrandt in the museum 
in the garden landscape architects and horticulturists do the 
best they can with the existing climate in the conservatory where 
heating and cooling systems may be computer controlled 
horticulturists can preserve rare plants plants that grow tens of 
thousands of miles away plants from the other side of the equator 
plants that people in a town would never see if it werent for the 
controlled climates the conservatories provide 
the concept dates back at least to roman times 
but in 1989 rock island a town of 40000 yet part of the quad 
city area on the mississippi river with a populace of 250000 has 
decided it wants a conservatory 
so it seems have a lot of others 
it may be the growth industry of culture as conservatories and 
dreams of glass houses for plants sprout across the country more 
than 150 million is being spent already 
experts such as joe kerwin of the new york botanical gardens in 
the bronx a 240acre complex with a beautiful turnofthecentury 
victorian conservatory say the boom partially reflects an 
ecologyconscious nation 
you turn on any news show and you will see a segment on how 
the rain forests are disappearing kerwin says everyone is now 
aware of a problem that few knew little about just a few years 
ago 
experts tell us that rain forests are disappearing at the rate 
of an acre a second and that the earth is losing three plant 
species an hour perhaps taking with them great medicinal or 
economic secrets 
but kerwin doesnt think concern for the ecology is the sole 
reason for the interest in conservatories 
if that were the case you could buy up quite a bit of 
brazilian real estate with 100 million and preserve the 
original he says 
there seems to be an attendant sense of civic pride about having 
a conservatory youve got the art museum the symphony a zoo and 
now by gosh its about time for that conservatory 
most of the new construction has been in the south and 
southwest where culture is moving in along with the satellite dish 
the brooklyn botanical garden played host to the firstever 
conference to study everything from fundraising to new methods of 
pest control as well as to show off its own 25 million 
restoration and new construction the steinhardt conservatory 
representatives of the four newest conservatories the ones in 
brooklyn san antonio atlanta and oklahoma city dominated the 
sessions dealing with architecture ventilation shading cooling 
and heating publicity the pros and cons of receiving municipal 
county or state support how to present a good educational program 
how to introduce predator insects 
it revealed a basic conflict between architects and 
horticulturists 
architects want to make a statement with the structure 
horticulturists want to obscure the structure as much as possible 
so that visitors feel they are lost in time as they meander through 
the misty fronds 
the whites of rock island are thinking more modestly than their 
brooklyn host perhaps 3 million to 4 million they personally 
have a bonsai collection of more than 100 trees someone else has a 
rose collection a third has a cactus collection and they all want 
to will them to a conservatory 
weve been talking about it for three years but ive met 
people here who have been trying to raise money for 18 years

they dont have the potential resources brooklyn has when costs 
ran high brooklyn found a lastminute benefactor wall streeter 
michael steinhardt who donated 3 million 
since his was the largest single donation the lovely glass 
houses connected underground are called the steinhardt 
conservatory 
you could say that you do get a lot of bang for your buck when 
you contribute to a conservatory observed mike bush the 
director of one of the new conservatories the myriad gardens 
crystal bridge in oklahoma city 
the crystal bridge is a 63 million modernistic structure that 
evokes the sense of being in a space capsule at the same time as 
being in a primeval world of nature 
some have described the 14000squarefoot cylindrical bridge as 
a trash can littering the landscape it is however an example 
of the creative architecture evolving in the greenhouse world 
in atlanta industrialist jb fuqua picked up the entire tab 
55 million for the dorothy chapman fuqua conservatory a 
conservatory with rare plants manmade mist freeflying birds a 
collection of more than 300 carnivorous plants it promises to be a 
major conservatory of the future with a commitment to preserving 
rare plants 
the new atlanta showpiece has 16000 square feet of display 
space and is named in honor of fuquas wife of 43 years 
in san antonio there is the new lucile halsell conservatory 
carved into the ground with a series of soaring glass roofs and 
containing an innovative alpine environment as well as the 
traditional palm trees showy orchids and cacti this 
90000squarefoot complex opened in 1988 carried a 7 million 
price tag 5 million of which came from the halsell foundation 
endowed by the late ewing and lucille halsell it was then turned 
over to the city to maintain with the hopes that it would be a 
major tourist attraction ranking just below the alamo and the 
river walk 
eric tschanz now at powell gardens in kansas city which has a 
conservatory in its future was the director at san antonio when it 
was built he says one study showed it ranked among the top five 
texas tourist attractions when it first opened 
part of that was because it was new he says a lot of 
conservatories have tremendous tourist appeal when they first 
open 
tschanz says that when st louis climatron opened in 1960 it 
was packed with tourists but it did not maintain that appeal 
the climatron was perhaps the most spectacular conservatory use 
of buckminster fullers geodesic dome a popular design in the 
miniboom of the 60s it now is undergoing a 128 million 
renovation mostly replacing the acrylic glass that had yellowed 
with age 
the west michigan horticultural society in grand rapids mich 
is one like rock island that is starting from scratch and 
eventually hopes to put together an 8 million botanical gardens 
and conservatory the county has donated 50 acres and they are 
about to launch the first fund drive 
it looks doable and were constantly on the march says the 
president betsy borre my family teases me about being president 
because my house plants are dying 
in murrells inlet sc a 5 million phase one is planned for 
brookgreen garden but hurricane hugo has taken the committee right 
back to the drawing boards the director gurdon tarbox thinks a 
traditional greenhouse would have gone with the winds 
brookgreen is unique for combining sculpture with plants 
the us botanical garden in washington dc lists 152 
million for what may be a renovation of the existing conservatory 
but may end up being a complete reconstruction 
robert halpern horticulturist for the cincinnati zoo and 
botanical gardens proposed putting birds into the conservatories 
some such as the fuqua conservatory already have them but it 
generally is not an idea whose time has come 
we have to get the public in and the sounds of birds the 
whirring of birds in flight a sighting of a bird is a great 
draw halpern says 
halpern tells of one canadian conservatory with freeflying 
birds that had to start screening the visitors one woman released 
her pet parakeet so it could live in splendor another was stopped 
before she could release a box of finches 
alden aust is a retired city planner and chairman of the 
committee to get a botanical gardens and conservatory in omaha neb 
he and his wife attended the conference to pick up pointers 
aust lists the usual reasons why he feels omaha should have a 
conservatory he holds what may be the strongest explanation until 
last 
well des moines has one and its half our size

during the last ice age about 16000 years 
ago when mammoths and mastodons roamed pennsylvania the boulders 
and gravel from retreating glaciers filled an ancient stream 
channel and created a 13milelong expanse of water waterlilies 
and waterfowl 
from all appearances little has changed conneaut marsh is 
inaccessible xcept by canoe and even then channels must be cut 
periodically through the mucky sediments and viney undergrowth to 
allow even limited passage 
it is in this isolated setting flanked on all sides by sparsely 
populated farms and tall stands of trees that a pair of bald 
eagles have built a home 
they represent two of 10 bald eagles nesting in waterrich 
crawford county in northwestern pennsylvania another 10 are 
believed to have taken up permanent residence along rivers in the 
central pat of the state thanks to programs devoted to relocating 
chicks taken from canadian nests and reintroducing them to the 
state 
this is an effort to return the national emblem to 
pennsylvania and make it available for citizens to observe without 
having to go to alaska or canada says jack byerly of the state 
game commission 
when i see an eagle flying along the river i want to say to my 
kid there goes our national emblem i dont want to say there 
goes one released from the hershey zoo i want to see it wild and 
flying free 
throughout the country from the deserts of arizona to the 
swamps of florida to the deep waters of the chesapeake bay eagles 
have made a dramatic comeback from the days of the nowbanned 
pesticide ddt which decimated the species three decades ago 
the population has climbed from an alltime low of about 350 
nesting pairs in the mid1960s to about 2400 nesting pairs today 
according to the national audubon society 
an additional 3000 to 7000 younger birds under the breeding 
age of 5 years are believed to roam the skies including roughly 
800 that have been released through relocation programs over the 
past decade 
although 20 eagles seems a small number in a state as large as 
pennsylvania there are countless more eagles spotted throughout 
the state at various times of year byerly says 
many are simply passing through on their migratory routes while 
others are part of a group of 88 young eagles that have been 
released over the past seven years but are not old enough to mate 
and build nests 
able to adapt to subarctic temperatures and hot arid climates 
the bald eagle is most often found where there are water and lots 
of fish 
this bird can literally be found in all the lower 48 states at 
all times of the year either as a nesting bird a migrating bird 
or a wintering bird says dan james an endangered species 
biologist with the us fish and wildlife service in minneapolis 
it nests in all but perhaps three or four states and it winters 
in or migrates through the rest 
so successful has been their recovery that the fish and wildlife 
service is considering taking eagles off the list of endangered 
species and changing their classification to threatened james says 
legally a threatened species is one that may become 
endangered if trends in the population continue he says what 
were seeing though is just the opposite clearly the eagle is 
on the increase 
but conservation groups say the tough majestic bird is still 
too fragile too easily harmed by mans destructive ways to take 
any chances the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska for example 
inflicted severe casualties in alaskas eagle nesting grounds

they say we are still a long way off from the estimated 50000 
eagles that once soared above the united states when this country 
was young and the eagle was named the national symbol 
theres not a lot of room for error on this a bird as big and 
vulnerable to habitat loss and poaching as the bald eagle deserves 
constant attention and we would rather err on the side of 
caution says m rupert cutler president of defenders of 
wildlife 
although ddt is behind us there are new chemicals being 
invented every day he says in addition we see rapid 
population growth urbanization the loss of wetlands and the loss 
of old growth forest trees in which the eagles nest and theres no 
reason for optimism as far as eagle habitat protection is 
concerned 
jim pissot who specializes in endangered species for the 
national audubon society in washington says he is excited by the 
idea that eagles may have recovered sufficiently to warrant 
changing their status 
but like cutler he worries their habitat will be whittled away 
little by little by a country eager to clear forests drain 
wetlands and build roads 
without strong federal oversight we could be picking away at 
their habitats a nest tree there some roosting areas someplace 
else and we could be in the position we were in 40 years ago 
he says 
even with the bird listed as endangered there still is the 
possibility that habitat will be lost but as the bird is 
downlisted to threatened that door opens wider and if its 
taken off the list entirely that door opens very wide 
regardless of the federal governments decision pennsylvania 
wildlife officials plan to maintain strict vigils over the states 
brood 
in conneaut marsh for instance birdwatchers are allowed no 
closer than a halfmile from the eagles nest or aerie while 
motorists driving through nearby erie national wildlife refuge are 
not permitted to stop or park on a section of roadway near another 
nest 
they are so fragile says brenda peebles who monitors the 
10 crawford county eagles for the pennsylvania game commission 
they dont like people they dont like to be disturbed if they 
have eggs and you come near them theyre likely to abandon their 
eggs 
a powerful predator the bald eagle is happiest ironically 
when it doesnt have to kill what it eats and can pick at the 
remains of dead fish and wounded ducks left behind by other 
predators 
eagles are thieves and robbers says scott wood an 
ornithologist with the carnegie museum of natural history in 
pittsburgh the osprey will catch the fish and the eagles will 
steal it from them 
bob faber a freelance naturalist from hiram ohio who 
conducts tours of conneaut marsh chuckles it doesnt make for a 
good image of the country 
nevertheless americans are fascinated with the elusive 
solitary bird 
a group of 40 pittsburgharea residents recently drove two hours 
and paddled canoes for several miles just to catch a glimpse 
through binoculars of the snowy white head of an eagle perched in 
a 7footdeep nest high atop a dead tree in conneaut marsh 
the marsh was alive with snipe warblers canada geese carp 
doing bellyflops but it was the pair of eagles either surveying 
their watery world from the nest or soaring silently over treetops 
that captured everyones attention 
i wouldnt have missed this for the world said betty 
abernathy 78 of pittsburgh who has traveled several continents 
to watch birds 
gay kalisz 43 of mcdonald added its not like a walk in 
the woods it was wonderful to see this after knowing of the 
slaughter theyve gone through

george washington advertised in it 
thomas jefferson sued it and mark twain tried to buy a piece of it 
the hartford courant born in 1764 above a barbershop in what 
was then a bustling river town just celebrated its 225th birthday 
another milestone for the nations oldest continuously published 
newspaper 
the courant celebrated in october by opening a 15 million 
addition to its main office and by cranking up the handoperated 
press that thomas green used to print the courant in the late 1700s 
the courant was a weekly until 1837 and so cannot lay claim to 
being the nations oldest daily that distinction belongs to the 
new york post printed daily since 1801 
the courant has never won a pulitzer prize and has always lived 
in the shadows of bigger more acclaimed newspapers in boston and 
new york but it has endured outlasting 40 nowdefunct hartford 
papers and today remains a robust newspaper in a troubled industry 
the fact that it has held up all these years and is still 
regarded as a paper of quality is impressive said everette 
dennis director of the gannett center for media studies in new 
york its not the new york times but it serves its purpose 
its a major regional newspaper 
with daily circulation at 225000 and slowly climbing the 
courant is by far the largest paper in connecticut it prints seven 
regional editions with news from more than 70 connecticut cities 
and towns from the massachusetts border to long island sound 
during the revolutionary war the courant had by its own 
account the largest circulation of any newspaper in the colonies 
and was an influential supporter of the revolution 
americans the courant blared to its readers in may 1775 
forever bear in mind the battle of lexington where british 
troops unmolested and unprovoked wantonly and in a most inhuman 
manner fired upon and killed a number of our countrymen 
when the constitution was proposed in 1787 the courant printed 
it in full as a news item the courant made clear its support for 
the constitution by running articles on the need for a stronger 
union of the states and printing unanswered letters from the 
constitutions advocates 
george washington was president when he ran two ads in the 
courant in 1796 the first offered four farms for rent near his 
mount vernon estate the president warned he would rent only to 
real farmers of good reputation and none others need apply 
during the early 1800s the courant like most newspapers of the 
time adopted a bitterly partisan tone the papers chief target 
was jefferson whom it saw as a godless slave owner a tool of 
france and an enemy of the constitution 
the jefferson administration took notice and indicted the 
courant for criminal libel in 1806 after the paper ran a story 
strongly implying that the administration had sent 60 tons of 
silver to france as a bribe 
the courant was vindicated six years later when the us supreme 
court dismissed the suit ruling that english criminal common law 
the basis for the indictment did not apply in the united states 
the courant enthusiastically backed abraham lincoln for 
president in 1860 and declared victory victory weve got 
em when lincoln won 
but the courant of the mid19th century was anything but 
progressive thomas day the publisher railed against immigrants 
and treated readers to large doses of his own racial and religious 
bigotry 
the caucasian variety is intrinsically a better breed of 
better brain better moral traits better capacity every way than 
the negro or the mongolian or the malay or the red american 
he wrote 
after the civil war the courant resisted the new journalism 
of the day a rambunctious style that gave readers a heavy dose of 
stories on crime and personalities and relied on a relatively new 
reporting technique the interview 
this the courant wrote was ungentlemanly journalism 
marked by the vile invention of interviewing 
it was during this period of polite and principled journalism 
that mark twain hartfords most celebrated writer tried to buy 
into the courant the offer was carefully considered and then 
turned down 
by the 1920s the courants prim approach to the news had earned 
it the nickname the old lady of state street a young managing 
editor named emile gauvreau tried to change that and for a brief 
period of four years the old lady became a flapper heavy on 
crime sex and photographs 
but gauvreaus taste for the bizarre proved too much for the 
staid courant and he was soon asked to leave he took his talents 
to the new york evening graphic where he boosted circulation to 
500000 with a sensational style that earned the paper the nickname 
pornographic 
the courant meanwhile regained its more measured voice 
although the great depression brought an air of quiet desperation 
the paper could not ignore the courant published stories on how 
to feed four on 9 a week 
the courant discovered its suburban readers in the postwar 
years and circulation more than doubled from 52000 in 1946 to 
130000 in 1964 when the paper turned 200 in 1964 it already had 
13 news bureaus crowded into the small state and more than 100 
correspondents phoning in local news 
in 1965 the courant overtook the hartford times in daily 
circulation and within 11 years the times once the citys 
dominant paper was dead the courants ascendancy made the paper 
an attractive property and in 1979 the los angelesbased times 
mirror co paid 105 million for the courant ending 215 years of 
local ownership 
the first years of times mirror management were somewhat rocky 
the papers new emphasis on regional stories feature writing and 
investigative projects clashed with a long tradition of exhaustive 
local coverage 
in hartford community activists demonstrated outside the 
newspaper charging that the courant had abandoned the city editor 
mark murphy was hanged in effigy reporter andrew kreig left the 
paper and wrote spiked a book accusing the courants new 
management of deceiving the papers readers in pursuit of a 
pulitzer prize 
under current editor and publisher michael j davies the 
courant has returned to an emphasis on local news and has opened a 
turf war against five suburban dailies by aggressively courting 
local advertisers in the cities and towns surrounding hartford

like millions of other children 3yearold tiffany 
geraldi went off to begin preschool this fall but she was soon 
sent home and told not to return 
tiffany was excluded because she has downs syndrome the first 
attempt at mainstreaming her with a typical preschool class had 
proved unsuccessful 
tiffanys adoptive parents dr michael geraldi and his wife 
camille were upset but not defeated 
they have adopted seven children with downs have pending 
adoptions for six others and have legal guardianship of another a 
grand total of 14 they also have two children of their own 
the geraldis began the up with down syndrome foundation in 
1987 and devoted it to training loving and caring for children 
with downs syndrome they also counsel the natural parents of the 
children 
in addition they provide day care for parents of other children 
with the problem and teach adults with downs how to develop better 
job skills and become more independent all of these services are 
free 
most of the children the geraldis have adopted who range in age 
from 2 months to 3 years have serious medical problems 
when you nourish and love them something happens their 
health improves dramatically ms geraldi says 
the problems can range from digestive disorders to serious heart 
defects one of their children 1yearold jolayne already has 
undergone two open heart surgeries and seven other major operations 
downs syndrome is a genetic defect resulting from a child 
having one extra chromosome this extra chromosome can cause the 
child to be born with a host of physical and mental problems 
symptoms can include a depressed nose clubfeet a raised upper 
lip wide spacing between fingers and toes and decreased mental 
capacity 
parents have been counseled in the past to put their child in an 
institution because of mental retardation but ms geraldi says 
current research shows that a loving home environment allows them 
to function at a higher level 
the foundations two group homes in the miami suburb of kendall 
are designed to provide that support she says 
ms geraldi a nurse with a special education degree says she 
developed a special sympathy for children with downs syndrome at a 
very young age 
when she was 5 years old she helped her father who volunteered 
at a nursing home for the retarded 
while she was working as a nurse at miami childrens hospital 
she met her husband and found they shared a love for children 
that were not perfect and normal 
he was as sensitive as i was to the children she says 
geraldi a pediatrician and his wife attempted to adopt a 
downs baby from various agencies including the department of 
health and rehabilitative services but never heard from any of 
them in the meantime they had their own two children renae 12 
and jaclyn 11 
but in 1986 they received a call about a very sick baby with 
downs in mississippi who was 5 weeks old and weighed only four 
pounds they picked her up in mississippi and after some legal red 
tape they adopted the child darlene now a healthy 3yearold 
the foundation is supported solely by donations and her 
husbands salary she says 
because of his salary they dont qualify for any kind of state 
aid she says 
they have spent more than 500000 so far in medical bills and 
hope to become eligible for medicaid 
ms geraldi says that fears of downs children that persisted 
until recent years were unfounded but many people are still uneasy 
around children with the disorder 
i was in the grocery store with some of the kids and when 
people saw us in an aisle they would turn and walk away she 
says 
a new television series is helping change that 
life goes on a critically acclaimed weekly series is the 
story of an 18yearold boy attempting to go to a regular high 
school with normal kids 
this experiment is known as mainstreaming and tries to integrate 
downs sufferers into normal environments 
but ms geraldi says i dont think the program is very 
realistic she says the boy on the tv program is exceptionally 
functional for someone with downs syndrome and has less of the 
physical characteristics 
however she says the show does portray the difficulties of 
mainstreaming 
the children encounter ridicule from classmates and lessons from 
teachers untrained in special education 
tiffanys teacher did not know how to discipline her when she 
refused to listen also other parents objected to her presence in 
the class 
after all ive seen i still cried when tiffany was sent 
home ms geraldi says

leviathan mgmua home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
nothing like borrowing from every scifi high adventure 
creature feature and still coming up a loser george p cosmatos 
leviathan starring peter weller and richard crenna does 
exactly that 
its easy to spot the basic recipe for alien and the 
abyss in this tale about the mutant result of a failed experiment 
most of the action takes place underwater where a mining team 
shades of the abyss is trapped with a genetic mess the 
underwater photography is not very special but the special effects 
are especially stan winstons creature 
weller who turned robocop into a cult hit of the 1980s 
provides wellneeded humor to an otherwise slow very slow story 
this video wont keep you on the edge of the sofa but its as 
good as any adventure fright night on commercial tv 
leviathan also features ernie hudson amada pays and daniel

on the matter of awards for actors daniel 
daylewis admits he likes to watch them but only as a fly on the 
wall 
that may change next march when the academy awards are handed 
out at the los angeles music center daylewis seems dead certain 
to be nominated for his absolutely stunning performance in the 
dublinmade my left foot he was acclaimed best actor in 
september at the montreal world film festival and received raves 
from critics at the new york film festival 
strange title right of course you cant learn from the ads 
a story about life laughter and the occasional miracle what 
the film is about what its about is christy brown the irish 
cerebral palsy victim who managed to become an acclaimed writer and 
artist although he was virtually mute and could express himself 
only with his left foot 
daylewis performance is no more downbeat than marlee matlins 
in children of a lesser god which also dealt with a handicap 
the actor captures all the rage frustration yearning and devilish 
humor of christy brown despite the physical limitations but then 
filmgoers have learned to expect the unexpected from daylewis in 
his brief film career 
consider these roles the blond gay punk of my beautiful 
laundrette the priggish slickhaired suitor in room with a 
view the lascivious czech surgeon in the unbearable lightness 
of being 
he manages to submerge his own persona in each role and it was 
a surprise to find him at the montreal festival a darkly handsome 
softspoken englishman with a headband holding back his long hair 
his outfit was highlighted by a pair of pajamalike pants of navy 
blue with large white polka dots 
interviewing daylewis is a challenge his replies are 
punctuated with thoughtful pauses as he struggles to say exactly 
what he means he admitted his early ambivalence about undertaking 
the portrayal of brown 
i didnt think that i could do it but i had a strong impulse 
to take it on beyond that i didnt really mind if i didnt do it 
i was very happy that it had given me the desire to work again 
which i had lost some time before so it seemed like a gift that 
had come from nowhere he said 
after finishing the unbearable lightness of being he had 
been afflicted not by actors block but with an unshakable 
fatigue which left me without any desire to perform whatsoever 
it lasted a year but he had expected it to last longer 
writerdirector jim sheridans script for my left foot 
intrigued daylewis and the pair spent three months researching in 
dublin the actor devoted much of the time at the sandymount clinic 
observing how children learn to deal with the physical limitations 
of cerebral palsy he also was accepted into the brown family 
christy died in 1981 
meanwhile producer noel pearson sought backing for the 15 
million project not an easy task the actor admitted 
you have to deal with a really immense reluctance and at 
worst a kind of cynical attitude that well this is a kind of 
cripple picture which makes me furious he said 
but of course thats what you come up against films tend to 
be financed by people who dont understand the process of 
filmmaking and have no passion for it its very difficult to offer 
your passion as a justification for making a film it doesnt 
work 
daylewis immersion in the brown role has astounded reviewers 
and the actor explained this may be presumptuous of me but i 
felt that i had an understanding of to some extent his anger his 
frustrations his desire to create his sense of impotence many 
different aspects of his life i felt i had an understanding of and 
they didnt relate specifically in my mind to his disability at all 
it became very important to me that it didnt become a film 
about a supposedly ablebodied actor taking on the physical 
manifestations of this supposedly disabled man that seemed to me a 
secondary importance 
daniel daylewis 32 had a far different background from the 
workingclass christy brown his father was englands poet laureate 
cecil daylewis his mother was actress jill balcon daughter of 
filmmaker sir michael balcon the boy made a brief acting debut at 
12 in sunday bloody sunday but in school contemplated 
becoming a cabinetmaker 
acting prevailed and he trained at the bristol old vic his 
adult debut in films came as a seaman in the mel gibsonanthony 
hopkins the bounty remake he toured with the royal shakespeare 
company playing leads in romeo and juliet and a midsummer 
nights dream then began his string of remarkable film 
portrayals 
daylewis was asked if he considered brown a genius 
after an extended silence he replied christy yeah id say 
that he was a genius in the way that he lived his life not 
necessarily in his work though i think that some of his writing is 
quite superb 
my admiration for him has more to do with the manner in which 
he lived his life and his uh relentless confrontation with 
things that people around him found difficult to accept

the audience was the wings club but those 
looking for news on donald trumps recent forays in the airline 
business got a dose of japanbashing instead when the developer 
spoke to an astonished crowd of industry executives 
japan is truly taking advantage of the united states they 
are ripping us like no one has ever ripped us before trump told 
a gathering of about 600 airline people monday at a new york hotel 
were the biggest suckers in the world were the biggest dopes 
in the world 
many in the audience were taken aback by trumps brash remarks 
which lashed out at the japanese west germans and south koreans 
for flooding this country with exports 
trump suggested that a import tax be put on items such as 
mercedes benz automobiles to exact a pound of flesh from the 
exporters 
the japanese are not allies of the united states while west 
germany is ripping us off and south korea is a major ripoff 
country trump said if we get any kinder or gentler we wont 
have any america left 
the remarks by trump best known for his new yorkbased real 
estate empire come in the wake of a japanese firms purchase of a 
controlling interest in the company that controls rockefeller 
center a new york landmark 
trump also owns the former eastern airlines shuttle and made a 
brief run at the parent of american airlines last month but he 
surprised the industry crowd by saying almost nothing about the 
airline business 
howard rubenstein a well known new york imagemaker whose 
clients include trump said the real estate tycoon has spoken 
publicly before about japan but that some of the themes sounded in 
mondays speech appeared to be new trump who didnt consult 
rubenstein about the speech spoke without a prepared text or notes 
trump bought the northeast shuttle service from eastern for 365 
million last june and made a 75 billion buyout proposal in 
october for amr corp parent of industry leader american he later 
dropped the amr offer after it had been rebuffed by management and 
the companys shares retreated sharply from an earlier runup 
in one of his few serious comments about the airline industry 
trump asserted after his speech that the amr shareholders have been 
absolutely crucified over the years 
its a well run airline but from the stockholders standpoint 
they have been treated horribly he said he declined comment 
however on whether he planned a new move regarding amr

labor education and business leaders have 
joined to launch a foundation linking the classroom with the 
workplace to stimulate high school students interest in business 
the national academy foundation offers a twoyear program for 
high school juniors and seniors with a special curriculum designed 
by educators in consultation with industry experts each student is 
offered a paid onthejob summer internship with a business 
the foundation is headed by former national urban league 
president vernon e jordan jr and former labor secretary william 
e brock it is modeled after the successful academy of finance 
pioneered in 1982 by american express co and its shearson lehman 
hutton brokerage division in new york city 
warning of an employment crisis within two to three years brock 
said monday that the only possible way we can avoid that is by 
having a recession so deep that we would be desperately worried 
about this country 
we are going to run short of people were going to run short 
of people with skills and there is no immediate response that could 
be made that will stop us from running into that problem he 
said pointing to the end of the baby boom era in five years 
when there will be an estimated 7 million fewer people in their 
twenties than there are now 
along with the manpower shortage brock said our children are 
being less well educated than we were thats insane its the 
first time in 200 years thats been true and its true today 
brock said the academy begins to address that problem he 
said there are 35 academy of finance programs in 17 cities and four 
academies of travel and tourism in two cities more than 170 
businesses have provided internships for academy students 
more than 2200 students are enrolled in academy programs 
including 60 percent minorities most of the students are juniors 
and seniors but high school freshmen and sophomores are offered 
preparatory courses to qualify them for the academy by the junior 
year 
academy courses are in addition to the regular high school 
curriculum for example academy of finance students take such 
courses as international finance security operations and financial 
planning travel and tourism classes include destination geography 
and tourism computer applications 
brock said school districts and school boards must invite the 
academy to their area and guarantee that financing for the program 
will continue once business startup money of about 50000 ends

aggressive stance in the coming years 
the 141 millionmember federation opened its 18th biennial 
constitutional convention monday beginning with a singalong to 
promote labor unity and ending by passing a resolution pledging 
support for union workers involved in several major strikes 
the most celebrated event of the weeklong convention comes 
today when solidarity leader lech walesa appears to thank the 
aflcio for its support of the polish trade union and accept the 
federations highest honor the george meany human rights award 
on monday the 800 delegates warmly welcomed the united mine 
workers back under labors umbrella and enjoyed a procession by 
hundreds of workers involved in the strikes one of which may soon 
be over 
communications workers of america president morton bahr told the 
gathering that his union and the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers have reached a tentative companywide settlement 
with nynex corp and hope to resolve local issues within a week 
the two unions represent 60000 workers who have been on strike for 
15 weeks against nynex which provides phone service in most of the 
northeast 
nynex strikers joined their counterparts at boeing pittston 
coal and eastern airlines in a march through the convention hall 
where delegates spent the day promoting labor solidarity and 
promising to end the 1980s a tough decade for labor on a positive 
and militant note 
umw president richard trumka addressing the convention a month 
after the mine workers ended 40 years of independence from the 
federation sounded a warning that antiunion employers who 
looked upon the 1980s with great fondness are about to have their 
visions shattered in the 1990s because we will never be separated 
again 
federation president lane kirkland who first took office 10 
years ago at the same hotel where the delegates are gathering this 
year said the success of the labor movement in poland and other 
nations in promoting democracy should serve as a lesson to those in 
this country who doubt the need for unions 
is it not reasonable to hope at least that american labors 
movement toward democracy in the world will provide a new lesson 
for americans regarding the role of trade unions in promoting and 
preserving freedom in our country kirkland asked 
the delegates also received praise from labor secretary 
elizabeth dole who acknowledged the numerous policy differences 
between labor and the bush administration but added the tireless 
efforts of americas unions have resulted in protection for all 
workers regardless of whether they are union members

combustion engineering inc a maker of 
industrial boilers says it will merge with a swiss company that is 
the worlds largest electrical equipment manufacturer in a 16 
billion deal 
abb asea brown boveri ltd will buy stamfordbased combustion 
engineering for 40 per share the companies announced monday the 
chief executives said the merger will join two firms that make 
complementary products for similar industries 
on the new york stock exchange combustion engineerings shares 
surged 1350 monday to close at 39 it was the most active issue 
of the day with nearly 56 million shares changing hands 
abb with 20 billion in annual sales supplies electrical 
equipment used in power generation transmission and distribution 
as well as equipment used in automation transportation 
environmental control and financial services 
combustion engineering with 35 billion in sales makes 
boilers used in power plants designs and constructs other types of 
plants and builds automated systems for factories it also owns 
wastetoenergy plants in hartford and detroit and performs 
environmental cleanup services 
the two companies are complementary in products industry 
coverage and regional presence abb chairman percy barnevik and 
combustion engineering chairman charles e hugel said in a joint 
statement 
the acquisition would be abbs second major deal announced this 
year in september it said it would pay 370 million to buy 
westinghouse electric corps 55 percent share of a joint venture 
with abb in power transmission and distribution 
earlier this year the justice department considered but 
rejected a proposal to block the creation of the joint venture on 
grounds of too much overlap between the two companies 
the merger announced monday also will likely face scrutiny on 
antitrust grounds but the chief executives said they are confident 
about the deal because the products and industries are 
complementary not competitive in addition the noted abb sells 
primarily in europe while combustion engineering sells in north 
america 
were quite confident theres no showstopper here hugel 
said 
the merger grew out of a discussion the executives had in august 
about the possibility of cooperative efforts in power generation 
they decided a full merger would be the best way to proceed 
under the agreement abb will buy all outstanding shares of 
combustion engineering stock for 40 each and assume 230 million 
in longterm debt on combustion engineerings books abb said the 
offer will not require financing 
barnevik said the merger would mean a greater commitment from 
abb in the power and industrial markets he also said the companys 
north american sales of 3 billion and staff of 15000 would 
increase to 7 billion and 40000 
abb only does about 1 percent of its business in eastern europe 
and combustion engineering even less but the chief executives said 
they see the east bloc nations as ripe for growth especially in 
light of the prodemocracy movements in poland and hungary and the 
opening of the berlin wall last week 
the process in eastern europe is irreversible said 
barnevik who said the companies annual sales there could grow to 
1 billion in a few years from the current 200 million 
marketplaces are coming together country boundaries are 
coming down and were simply heading for one world market said 
hugel whose company in the last two years has announced two 
agreements to build plants and supply instrumentation and software 
in the soviet union 
hugel is no stranger to buyouts he was nonexecutive chairman 
of rjr nabisco inc which means he was chairman of the board but 
not a company employee during the nabisco bidding war of 1988 and 
a director of primerica corp when it was sold to commercial credit 
corp that same year 
combustion engineering will retain its managers and stamford 
headquarters under the merger 
abb was formed in january 1988 as a partnership between asea ab 
of sweden and bbc brown boveri ltd of switzerland

agricultural businesses damaged by last 
months california earthquake may get aid under the same program 
providing assistance to droughtaffected farmers 
the house approved a bill on a voice vote monday amending the 
federal disaster assistance act of 1989 to include speciality 
growers and processors hit by the earthquake 
rep leon panetta dcalif sponsor of the bill that goes to 
the senate said many agriculture businesses slip through the 
safety net that our nations disaster programs are supposed to 
provide 
the earthquake that rocked northern california damaged fruit and 
ornamental trees caused food processing plants to shut down in 
midharvest and disrupted work at wineries 
the legislation provides reimbursement of 65 percent of the cost 
of replanting trees and seedlings it also guarantees loans to 
agricultural businesses increasing from 200 million to 300 
million the amount that may be loaned through the program

the near destruction of 7007 pounds of cooked 
roast beef led the house to pass legislation allowing courts that 
confiscate wholesome meat to donate it to charity 
i introduced the bill to fill a void in the existing law 
said rep lawrence smith dfla whose measure was approved on 
voice vote monday the bill goes to the senate 
it stems from a miami case known as us vs 7007 pounds of 
cooked roast beef involving imported meat confiscated because it 
was fraudulently labeled usda choice 
though inspected by a foreign agency trusted by the federal 
government it had not been inspected by the us department of 
agriculture and could not be sold with a fraudulent usda stamp 
when the importer relinquished the meat and the suggestion was 
made that it be given to the needy the federal court found that no 
provision for such action existed in the law 
smith said the judge eventually got the meat to a food bank for 
the poor through creative interpretation of the law 
we fed 35000 people with this meat smith said 
his bill legalizes donation to charity as a means of disposing 
of confiscated meat 
this legislation costs the american taxpayer no money and 
makes a significant contribution to fighting hunger in this 
country he said

the enormous size of the nations private 
pension system is frustrating government watchdogs who warn that 
the retirement savings of millins of working americans are 
vulnerable to fraud and mismanagement 
the most alarming reports come from the labor departments 
inspector generals office which says failure to shore up the laws 
and bolster enforcement could result in a taxpayerfunded bailout 
dwarfing the recent savings and loan crisis 
theres an insidious and steady siphoning off which 
ultimately affects the employees says raymond maria acting 
inspector general for the labor department i am convinced there 
is substantial fraud and abuse 
an associated press investigation found that at least onefourth 
of the private pension plans audited by the government are in 
violation of the law yet the odds of any individual program being 
checked are less than one in a hundred 
the department has just 300 inspectors to police the nations 
870000 private pension plans but instances of fraud and abuse 
that already have come to light are touching off alarms in 
washington 
in some cases pension administrators have siphoned off millions 
of dollars by underreporting earnings in others employers never 
made required contributions with pensioners discovering only upon 
retirement that the money was missing still other companies have 
simply dumped their pension obligations on a government insurance 
program that already is 15 billion in the red 
what makes the system most vulnerable officials say is its 
size 
frequently described as the largest lump of money in the 
world the nations private pension plans hold assets of 2 
trillion or roughly 8000 for every man woman and child in the 
united states those funds cover some 76 million participants 
the labor department audited 1553 plans in 1989 with 
violations found in 492 or almost onethird a similar rate was 
found in 1988 audits after three years in which the violation rate 
was about 25 percent 
the government is the final insurer of many private pension 
assets through the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc 
which receives most of its funds from pension plan premiums posted 
a 15 billion deficit in 1988 and a general accounting office 
study predicted that the corporation would be insolvent by 2001 
congress is investigating the stability of the insurance system 
which the office of management and budget recently put on a list of 
highrisk programs 
most pbgc claims have come from the beleaguered steel industry 
but executive director james b lockhart recently cautioned the 
corporations deficit could double if the agency has to bail out 
the major airlines undergoing financial difficulties 
if they go bust the taxpayer picks up the bill just like 
the sampls said joe mcgowan of the inspector generals office 
the governments ability to legislate pension safety is limited 
because the plans exist solely at the discretion of employers who 
in some cases drop the retirement programs rather than reform them 
plus only 40 million pensioners in 107000 private plans are 
covered by the pbgc most of the others have no insurance at all 
karen ferguson director of the pension rights center a public 
interest group points out that detection of fraud is slim with 
only about 1 percent of the submitted plans subject to labor 
department audits 
its astonishing how much of the money is being stolen ms 
ferguson said the pension money is sitting there and nobodys 
looking 
in just one new york case investigators concluded that some 14 
million had been stolen from two union locals by a broker and a 
financial adviser the labor department says mario renda and martin 
j schwimmer made the money by soliciting kickbacks on 100 million 
in investments 
but the concern is by no means limited to large institutional 
programs ms ferguson says one typical case was found in a 
dentists office 
the receptionist wanted to retire but found the pension money 
wasnt there she explained the dentist made loans to himself 
and invested in florida land 
according to documents obtained under the freedom of information 
act the inspector generals office in late 1987 investigated 168 
pension and welfare plans and found 187 million in misused assets 
and administrative violations 
congress in 1974 enacted the employment retirement income 
securities act known as erisa to protect pension and welfare plan 
assets the act established standards for how the plans were to be 
operated in the interests of the participants 
officials say the majority of big business pension funds are 
stable and well run nonetheless the complexities of the 
employment retirement income security act of 1974 or erisa 
coupled with the huge number of pensions leave many plans open to 
fraud 
the labor departments pension welfare benefits administration 
responsible for enforcing erisa rules has only 300 inspectors 
maria wants to put more of the burden on private accountants 
who under erisa audit large plans yearly he would require them to 
report any prohibited transactions directly to the labor department 
but the best way to avoid fraud and embezzlement maria said is 
to bring more criminal charges and fewer civil suits 
i submit it is the jail term that is the deterrent not the 
fine he said today theres no stigma to being a defendant in 
a civil suit 
the pension welfare benefits administration conducted 5000 
investigations of pension and welfare benefit plans over the last 
three years with just 95 classified as criminal there were 26 
convictions 
the inspector generals office of labor racketeering in 
comparison has obtained 179 criminal convictions since 1986 but 
that office is barred by a march justice department opinion from 
investigating nonunion plans 
the labor departments deputy secretary roderick dearment 
insists that pensioners shouldnt be alarmed 
we dont have a savings and loan crisis in the pension 
industry he said 
still dearment said he is carefully looking at the inspector 
generals reports even though he doesnt believe the system is 
about to collapse that doesnt mean we shouldnt address the 
potential he said 
lisa phillips an aide to rep tom lantos dcalif said the 
warnings cannot be ignored 
we took some heat especially with hud ms phillips said 
noting that internal reports outlined problems in that agency years 
before they attracted widespread attention hud sensitized us to 
ig reports 
lantos government operations subcommittee held a hearing in 
august with further meetings scheduled most likely early next 
year rep william hughes dnj will hold a hearing this week in 
his select committee on aging 
when similar warnings were ignored about the savings and loan 
industry and about hud program administration the cost to the 
american taxpayer and to our economy became staggering lantos 
said

not as professional managers the business never should have been 
sold to kkr it was a terrible mistake the source said 
this is the busy season and kkr wants leadership that 
leads another unnamed source told the boston herald 
that newspaper also quoted sources saying there had been growing 
friction between the goldbergs and kohlberg kravis roberts and that

seasonally adjusted 1445 billion last month after rising 09 
percent in august and 07 percent in september 
the last time retail sales fell was in february when they 
dropped 04 percent they were unchanged in june 
the october decline was the largest since a 67 percent drop in

of the california earthquake and a strike in the aircraft industry 
the operating rate for factories mines and utilities fell 08 
percentage points to 828 percent

credit is slowing the economy

plunged 51 percent in october car sales which represent about 20 
percent of retail total had been propped up by incentives for much

decline in october 1987 durable sales were flat in september after

and other home furnishing sales edged up 03 percent following a

georgiapacific corps attempt to buy 
great northern nekoosa corp shifted back to federal court in 
maine where great northern today responded to lawsuits challenging 
regulations that make a takeover difficult legally and financially 
great northern denying that antitakeover provisions of its 
bylaws were designed to entrench management at shareholder 
expense said it was ironic that georgiapacific itself has a 
shareholder rights plan and supermajority voting rules similar to 
the ones it is challenging in court 
the directors of corporations which take such steps the 
directors of great northern no less than the directors of 
georgiapacific act lawfully and responsibly when they take steps 
of this nature that are reasonably calculated to promote the best 
interests of the company and its shareholders in the context of a 
proposed takeover the great northern response said 
great northern which is headquartered in connecticut but 
incorporated in maine filed the papers in us district court in 
portland maine 
great northern a norwalk connbased paper products company 
on monday rejected georgiapacifics 313 billion takeover bid 
saying it was too low and would be financially disastrous for both 
companies 
great northern also filed an antitrust suit against 
georgiapacific in bridgeport conn 
georgiapacific a forest products company based in atlanta 
harshly criticized great northerns directors for voting sunday to 
reject the 58ashare bid made oct 30 
t marshall hahn jr georgiapacifics chairman challenged the 
antitrust allegations saying the offer represented a 50 percent 
premium above the market price of the stock before takeover 
speculation drove up prices 
great northerns stock closed down 75 cents monday at 6137 a 
share on the new york stock exchange georgia pacific shares fell 
25 cents to 4637 
the board has put forth specious arguments in order to reject 
a legitimate and negotiable proposal without offering any 
alternative that meets its responsibilities to shareholders or the 
companys future hahn said in a statement 
he said the company would continue to try to meet with the board 
and management and pursue all necessary courses of action to 
successfully realize the best interests of all concerned 
but great northern chairman william r laidig said the companies 
were not talking 
georgiapacific doesnt talk to us except through the courts 
at this stage of the game he said referring to both the 
antitrust suit in connecticut and the takeover suit in maine where 
great northern is incorporated 
great northern which had sales of 36 billion last year makes 
paper products lumber and plywood at mills and factories in six 
states georgiapacific had 95 billion in sales from paper

directors of ual corp have instructed their 
financial adviser to explore alternatives to an investor groups 
attempt to dump the board and take control of the airline company 
condor partners presented ual the parent of united airlines 
with the necessary documents monday to gain access to the companys 
list of stockholders to begin its solicitation of shareowners 
after a meeting later in the day the board issued a statement 
saying it had authorized its financial adviser first boston corp 
to explore potential transactions with third parties including 
actively determining available alternative deals such as employee 
ownership or recapitalization 
the board said it had not received an offer from condor or any 
third party 
but augustus oliver one of condors three general partners 
said the board has misrepresented his groups position 
we never said we were going to put forth a proposal until 
being elected to the board oliver said we feel that we need 
to be on the board to be in a position to act on behalf of the 
company 
condor was formed as a takeover vehicle by coniston partners of 
new york which announced nov 3 that it had acquired 97 percent 
of ual 
conistons immediate objective is to reduce uals board from 16 
members to five three of whom would be conistons principals 
the other two are current board members stephen wolf uals 
chairman president and chief executive officer and frank olson 
but the company said monday both have indicated theyre not 
interested in serving on a board controlled by coniston 
uals shares closed monday at 19325 up 375 in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading 
it was one month ago on oct 13 that a pilotmanagement effort 
to buy the company for 300 a share collapsed for lack of financing 
analysts say speculators want to see ual sold or recapitalized 
quickly to minimize their losses from that setback 
if i were on the board i would assume that there are 
sufficient shares held by accounts sympathetic to coniston that 
would result in a majority vote against the board said samuel 
buttrick an analyst with kidder peabody amp co in new york 
officials of the air line pilots association chapter at united 
met last week with coniston and financier saul steinberg a friend 
of wolf who is seeking government permission to buy more than 15 
percent of ual 
pilots said they have discussed a revised bid with ual 
management but they hinted last week that they might resume a work 
slowdown unless the ual board recommits in the next two weeks to 
majority employee ownership 
uniteds machinists union employees who opposed the failed 
buyout bid also met last week with coniston they say they wont 
support any highly leveraged deal that could threaten the airlines 
viability or that would involve wolf

international business machines corp announced 
a longdelayed set of datastorage devices on tuesday and revealed 
that the expensive delay was caused by internal problems not a 
supplier 
the delay from the original july announcement date contributed 
to a 30 percent drop in the computer giants thirdquarter 
earnings disk drives for storing data from mainframe computers 
account for about a tenth of ibms roughly 60 billion in annual 
revenue 
some analysts had speculated that ibms trouble came from a 
flawed part from an outside supplier but ibm said it was a 
chemistry problem that caused magnetic particles from a 10inch 
platter to cling to a readwrite head a microscopic version of the 
common problem of dirty heads on a tape recorder 
ibm solved the problem by using a different chemistry for the 
thin raspberry jam layer of material that covers the magnetic 
particles on the platter according to paul low president of the 
general products division 
the new chemistry completely solved the problem and the new 3390 
disk drives are the most reliable in the industry he said 
the new drives can do three times the work in onethird the 
floor space of models introduced just two years ago ibm said 
ibm said the disk drives will be shipped beginning dec 1 and 
that the company expects to increase production enough to meet 
customer demand by the apriljune quarter of next year 
ibm earned 877 million in the third quarter down from 125 
billion a year earlier

a republican leader of a house panel 
investigating the generic drug scandal says he fears the departure 
of food and drug commissioner frank young will delay needed changes 
at the agency 
but others on capitol hill welcome the change at the 
governments principal consumer protection agency with one 
consumer group calling young by far the worst fda commissioner 
in the past 18 years 
young who has been fda commissioner since july 1984 will leave 
the agency next month to take another top position within the 
department of health and human services 
the new job deputy assistant secretary for health handling 
science and environmental matters is an expansion of a vacant post 
in the public health service fda is part of the public health 
service 
rep thomas bliley rva ranking republican on the house 
energy and commerce investigations subcommittee said young was 
part of the solution not part of the problem at fda he said he 
feared youngs departure would be a setback in efforts to make 
needed reforms at the agency 
the department has not announced a replacement for young but 
unlike young and his predecessors who were appointed by the hhs 
secretary the next fda commissioner will have to be confirmed by 
the senate which could lengthen the time it will take for a 
replacement to take over 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they 
believed young was being forced out in the fallout over the scandal 
that uncovered fraud corruption and mismanagement within the fdas 
generic drug division and the generic industry 
department officials however discounted the speculation as 
unfounded rumor and said young was eager to take the new job even 
though the move is a lateral one 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the panel said he 
didnt blame young for the fdas generic drug problems which led 
to bribery convictions of several fda employees and drug company 
officials along with disclosures that some companies cheated on 
product safety tests 
his intentions were good and he did his best when problems 
were brought to light but he was handicapped by the budgets and 
attitudes of an administration that let the agency go to seed 
dingell said 
but rep ted weiss dny chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on human resources said under extreme 
pressure from the reaganbush white house frank young oversaw the 
erosion of fda as an independent watchdog agency as a result the 
american public has lost the confidence in fdas ability to protect 
consumers from unsafe foods and drugs 
dr sidney wolfe director of the public citizen health research 
group called young by far the worst fda commissioner in the 18 
years since ralph nader and i started the health research group 
he said young has been more concerned with protecting the 
industries fda is supposed to regulate than in protecting the 
public from these industries 
the fda is one of the most visible government agencies 
responsible for assuring the safety of drugs cosmetics and most 
food products 
department officials denied that the generic drug scandal had 
anything to do with the changes in fact the departments 
announcement that young will move into the new position dec 18 
praised his handling of the generic drug problems 
all of the rumors are just that typical washington 
nonsense said james brown a spokesman for the public health 
service

mack trucks inc today reported a 
thirdquarter loss of 875 million as sales in the heavyduty 
truck market continued to soften 
walter c meck executive vice president of finance and chief 
financial officer said mack expects losses to continue through the 
fourth quarter and possibly into 1990 
the thirdquarter loss at 294 per share came on sales of 
3674 million in the same period a year ago mack earned 27 
million or 9 cents a share on 501 million in revenue 
for the first nine months of 1989 mack reported a loss of 
1059 million or 357 a share compared with a net profit of 18 
million or 61 cents a share in the same 1988 period revenue 
totaled 14 billion down from 16 billion a year earlier 
mack officials said recent losses were due to a downturn in the 
heavyduty truck market problems with introducing new products 
and the high costs of liquidating used vehicles and warranties the 
number of mackproduced heavyduty vehicles sold in the third 
quarter was 34 percent lower than in the same period a year ago 
the company said 
macks new chairman and chief executive officer ralph e reins 
said the company was facing one of the most difficult periods in 
the companys 89year history 
mack has taken a number of actions during recent months to 
eliminate expenses cut back on capital expenditures and reduce 
inventory levels reins said however it is clear that further 
actions are needed to improve macks competitiveness a new mack 
will emerge from this effort a leaner company a tougher 
competitor 
in august alone the company announced more than 600 layoffs at 
plants in waynesboro sc hagerstown md and allentown pa 
according to mack spokesman james santanasto he said he did not 
know the exact number of layoffs but said the companys workforce 
would be reduced by 21 percent in the last six months of 1989 
macks former chairman john b curcio resigned in october as 
the company announced it expected to lose about 50 million in the 
third quarter curcio lost the position of president to reins in 
june when the company announced expected secondquarter losses and 
the chief executive position to reins in september 
the push to remove curcio was apparently led by renaults truck 
operations which owns about 45 percent of macks stock and has 
four directors on macks 10member board

the dollar fell tuesday against most major 
currencies in moderate european trading after the release of 
disappointing us economic data 
gold prices also fell 
dealers said the dollar was knocked down by 
steeperthanexpected falls in us retail sales and industrial 
production for october 
retail sales fell 1 percent last month compared with a 
predicted 08 percent decline and production output dropped by 07 
percent compared with a projected 02 percent fall 
dealers said the markets reaction was restrained before 
thursdays scheduled release of us merchandise trade figures for 
september 
in tokyo the dollar rose 025 japanese yen to a closing 14380 
yen lat to 
encourage such spending by us government and business 
if you engage in any activity in our country others will 
emulate your example walesa said the world is awaiting your 
signal it is watching you do not let the world and us wait any 
longer 
walesa offered the aflcio repeated thanks and praise for 
assistance dating back to just after the gdansk shipyard strike he 
led in 1981 to solidaritys forced underground days when the 
federation provided an estimated 5 million worth of communications 
equipment and other supplies 
you have proven to be our most steadfast allies in the trade 
union struggle for human freedom walesa said in the text of his 
speech saying others who have endorsed solidaritys cause have not 
backed up their rhetoric with help 
sometimes we feel as if we are swimming chained hand and foot 
trying to summon all our energy just to make it safely to shore 
walesa said and on the shore there is a cheering crowd of people 
who offer us their admiration instead of simply throwing a life 
belt we want to make it to the shore to join the community of 
democratic countries with efficient economies 
walesa recalled the emigration of poles to the united states in 
search of freedom and said he had traveled across the atlantic 
just to tell you that hope has found its way to poland too for the 
first time in several dozen years poles can feel the breeze of 
freedom in their own country the breeze many people once had to 
seek on this side of the ocean 
he warned that if the new solidarityled government in poland 
fails to revive the economy more than polands new democracy and 
people would suffer and that success depended on help from abroad 
if we fail to convince people that although things are 
changing slowly they are nevertheless changing for the better then 
this breeze of freedom i spoke of will soon disappear leaving 
behind only a sense of bitterness accompanying unaccomplished 
dreams he said it will result in a defeat for us but not 
only for us 
walesa a nobel peace prize winner told bush on monday im 
full of admiration for your country not because its a big power 
and not because its rich even though one could envy that i 
admire america as a country of freedom he said 
bush moved walesa to tears recalling how he made the sign of 
the cross on the foreheads of his sleeping children before polish 
police took him away in 1981 for 11 months during the martial law 
crackdown on solidarity 
now bush said lenin and stalin have been disproved not by 
presidents or princes but by the likes of an electrician from 
gdansk and his fellow workers in a brave union called solidarity 
the iron curtain is fast becoming a rusted abandoned relic 
the week that brought lech walesa to america is the week the 
headlines proclaimed and the wall comes tumbling down said 
bush

percent for the big three 
the sales continued a trend begun in the first 10day reporting 
period of october as the 1990 model year opened 
analysts had forecast slumping car and truck sales during the 
fourth quarter of this year because carbuyers headed to the 
showrooms weeks before to avoid 1990model price increases and to 
take advantage of incentive programs on 1989 models 
those programs have been whittled for 1990 vehicles 
in october car and light truck sales by the big three were down 
141 percent from the year before that slump pushed octobers 
retail sales down 1 percent the first decline in eight months 
the earlynovember sales pace of 24094 vehicles a day was 17 
percent below the 29016 vehicleaday sales pace during the same 
period a month ago

victims of the worst thrift failure in history 
told a house committee today they were duped into investing their 
life savings in what they were told were federally insured 
securities only to learn later they were worthless junk bonds 
connie wickman 78 of west hills calif told the house 
banking committee she and her 80yearold husband were devastated 
when they were told earlier this year their 25000 in bonds sold 
through lincoln savings and loan association and issued by its 
parent company american continental corp of phoenix ariz was 
lost 
when a senior citizen loses their life savings it is not only 
the money they lose but something more important mrs wickman 
said in a barely audible voice they have failed themselves 
their children their families and also in tomorrow believing 
there is nothing left for them to believe in 
the wickmans are among 22000 people mostly los angelesarea 
retirees who state and federal officials say were targeted by 
lincoln to switch nearly 200 million of federally insured deposits 
into junk bonds after federal examiners first recommended closing 
the sampl in may 1987 
those bonds became virtually worthless when american continental 
declared bankruptcy last april one day before the government 
finally seized its irvine calif lincoln subsidiary which had 
lost an estimated 2 billion in savers federally insured deposits 
the government last month filed a 11 billion suit against 
lincolns owner phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr 
charging fraud and racketeering 
meanwhile both the fbi and the senate ethics committee are 
investigating whether five senators who received 13 million in 
political contributions from keating intervened with federal 
regulators in keeping lincoln open for two years after government 
examiners recommended closing it down 
the five senators dennis deconcini dariz john mccain 
rariz alan cranston dcalif donald riegle jr dmich and 
john glenn dohio all have denied any wrongdoing 
but mrs wickmans daughter frances rose of west hills held 
keating and cranston responsible for what she described as a fraud 
that could make her parents destitute in the near future 
over the past three years keating has contributed a total of 
974000 in either campaign funds to cranston or to voter 
registration and other political causes headed by members of 
cranstons family among the items being investigated by the fbi is 
whether any of that money was illegally diverted from lincoln 
depositors accounts 
they found it so painfully hard to believe that senator 
cranston a man whom they had supported and voted for during many 
years had received part of his hardearned dollars carefully saved 
each weeks for 30 years mrs rose said of her parents 
the gentlemen mr cranston mr keating and others from 
american continental have not even had the decency to show a 
simple courtesy and answer one of the many letters we have written 
to them in the past year she said 
the house committee which has been holding hearings into 
lincoln for a month heard from three other investors whose savings 
were lost as it turned its investigation to the roles of the 
securities and exchange commission and private accounting firms in 
the alleged fraud 
what truly hurts in this situation is that 90 percent of the 
debentures were peddled to the public long after the alarm 
bells had gone off at the federal home loan bank board said 
committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
meanwhile the nations top thrift regulator who as the bank 
boards chairman since 1987 has been the target of the panels 
probe says he has no intention of resigning amid indications he may 
be lossing support from the bush administration 
ive had no indication either way from the president m 
danny wall told reporters monday in response to president bushs 
remark that he has not ruled out replacing wall as director of the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
bush in an interview with texas reporters last friday said he 
intended to respond fairly soon to a request last month by the 
house committees chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas to 
replace wall 
im not closing the door on it i just dont know at this 
juncture bush said but when the question is put if part of 
the savings and loan problem proves to be management or regulation 
people that arent aggressive enough would you make changes the 
answer is yes 
wall a former banking aide to sen jake garn rutah said 
monday that he interprets those remarks as an indication the 
president wants to hear both sides before making any judgment 
the president knows that one is innocent until proven 
guilty wall said reiterating complaints that gonzalez has 
repeatedly postponed his appearance before the panel certainly 
one has to have an opportunity to respond to the questions that are 
raised

a japanese companys decision to build a 
sake plant near here is a sign that colorado is becoming well known 
in japan a state economic development official says 
i think theres a growing awareness of colorado in the minds 
of the japanese citizens said susan blansett who is a business 
development representative for the states office of economic 
development 
colorado is gaining a favorable image theyre beginning to 
equate it with the mountains the clean water and environment in 
general she said 
the tatsuumahonke brewing co ltd which brews a sake called 
hakushika is purchasing an eightacre parcel for the brewery in 
the coors technology center it plans to break ground on a 7 
million 50000squarefoot plant in april when in operation the 
plant will employ about 50 people including 30 from colorado 
the company began looking at colorado sites about a year ago 
and signed the deal in september said officials at adolph coors 
co which is selling the land to tatsuuma 
tatsuuma will compete with four other japanese sake brewers for 
the us market the officials say most of the companies are 
building plants in california 
tatsuuma officials chose colorado because they thought a plant 
here would preserve a niche coors officials said 
from the beginning they really wanted to differentiate 
themselves from their competitors said sandra woods coors vice 
president for corporate real estate the quality of water was the 
most important thing to them 
tatsuuma officials wanted the quality first and a good 
relationship with the community added alec garbini coors 
director of corporate property development 
economic development officials believe colorado eventually may 
emerge as a bigger lure for japanese tourism and investment than 
the canadian rockies 
japanese companies already have purchased the breckenridge and 
steamboat springs ski resorts

dow jones amp co inc said tuesday it is 
introducing an interactive 900number telephone service that will 
enable callers to get stock quotes business and financial news 
sports reports and weather conditions 
dow jones publisher of the wall street journal plans to charge 
85 cents for the first minute and 75 cents for each additional 
minute for calls to its service called journalphone 
the service begins operation wednesday and will be promoted each 
weekday with advertising in the journal 
its creators called the service a logical extension of the 
newspaper 
it picks up where the journal leaves off and offers an easy 
convenient way to keep on top of the news as it develops throughout 
the day said kenneth l burenga a senior vice president of dow 
jones 
callers who want to find out at midmorning what the latest 
government indicators showed for example can hear a recorded 
report by dialing 1900journal and pushing the appropriate 
telephone buttons as prompted by the service 
when callers have heard enough they can push a few more buttons 
and obtain 15minute delayed quotes on any of 6500 stock prices 
regularly updated reports on the overall stock bond or currency 
markets information about weather in selected cities or reports 
on sports stories or scores 
the calls will be charged on regular monthly phone bills 
dow jones is not the first newspaper publisher to provide 
telephone services although its service may offer the widest array 
of reports 
a number of newspapers for instance provide sports scores by 
telephone for the cost of a local telephone call 
gannett co incs usa today provides four callin services on 
900numbers including hotlines for sports information and scores 
weather reports lottery results and horse racing results 
phil fuhrer vice president of gannett new media said the 
sports hotline receives 27 million calls a year at 60 cents for 
the first minute and 45 cents for each minute after that it 
extends our coverage to 24 hours a day he said 
dow jones executives said they were not sure how many calls to 
expect on their new service it tested the service for three months 
this past summer in atlanta where about 10000 journal readers 
were invited to use the system for free the test showed the 
average calls lasted about two minutes 
the company already provides a more expensive interactive 
telephone service for active traders and plans to use the same 
staff and facilities for its new service which is geared more 
toward average investors 
dow jones expects the new service to be profitable from the 
start

the economys sluggish manufacturing sector 
was hammered by an aircraft strike and an earthquake last month 
which pounded industrial production down 07 percent to its lowest 
level in three and a half years the government reported tuesday 
but the federal reserve board said that without the strike at 
the boeing co and the disruptive effects of the earthquake the 
total index would have been nearly unchanged in october continuing 
its recent sluggish trend 
nevertheless the decline was the steepest since a 13 percent 
drop in march 1986 
industrial production was unchanged in september and has shown 
weakness in recent months as the fed kept a tight grip on credit to 
slow the economy and curb inflation 
the october output was foreshadowed by the labor departments 
report earlier this month of a loss of 13000 manufacturing jobs in 
october a drop in the average manufacturing work week and 
virtually no factory overtime 
but david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co in 
new york said the sluggishness was worsened by the strike which 
added 04 percent to the decline and the earthquake which added 
another 02 percent 
if you take into account the special factors we were down 
just 01 percent he said that is much more consistent with 
the pattern of proceeding months in which the industrial sector is 
showing weakness while the others particularly the service sector 
are holding up well 
john silvia an economist with kemper financial services in 
chicago said fairly steady consumer spending coupled with a weak 
manufacturing sector indicates a little bit of a twotier economy 
showing up again similar to what we had earlier in this economic 
expansion 
but while the feds interestrate policies were having an 
adverse effect on some segments of the economy another report 
indicated it was being successful in keeping inflation in check 
in that report the central bank said the operating rate of the 
nations factories mines and utilities fell 08 percentage point 
to 828 percent in october analysts generally consider an 
operating rate of 85 percent or more to be inflationary because it 
could lead to shortages and thus higher prices 
factory use had dipped in september to 836 percent from 838 
percent in august the rate posted 10year highs of 843 percent 
last december and january 
industrial production at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods was down 08 percent in october after 
falling 02 percent in september and rising 04 percent in july 
durable manufacturing was off 15 percent compared with a 03 
percent drop in september and a 04 percent gain in august

the farm credit system reported tuesday that its 
third quarter profit jumped 42 percent over a year ago 
the system said it netted 139 million in the three months ended 
sept 30 compared with earnings of 98 million in the 1988 period 
for the first nine months of this year it earned 457 million 
vs 434 million the previous year 
b dale harrison chairman of the federal farm credit banks 
funding corp the financing arm of the farm credit system 
attributed the improvements largely to higher net interest income 
and fewer loan losses 
net interest income totaled 236 million for the third quarter 
up from 211 million last year and to 732 million for the 
ninemonth period up from 571 million 
the system said that net interest income increased as a result 
of continued improvement in the credit quality of its loan 
portfolio stemming from a reduction in nonaccrual loans 
when loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted 
for only as they come in rather than when they are due 
the systems nonearning assets which consist of nonaccrual 
loans and other property owned declined 21 percent to 314 
billion during the first nine months of 1989 
the farm credit system is a nationwide system of federally 
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural 
econ the system took several steps last year to streamline its 
structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of 
up to 4 billion in governmentbacked lowinterest loans

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade after a quiet session 
prices had opened lower across the board reflecting 
disappointment over chinas cancellation of a wheat purchase and a 
slackening of export activity but the corn and soybean markets 
rallied at midday and finished mostly higher 
the agriculture department said monday that private exporters 
had reported cancellation of sales of 300000 metric tons of us 
wheat to china that had been slated for delivery in the 199091 
crop year which begins june 1 
in addition to its impact on the wheat market the cancellation 
revived fears that the soviet union may be forced to cancel some of 
its recent us corn purchases due to jammed shipping routes 
the wheat cancellation brings us back to the reality that 
sales can be canceled said william biedermann director of 
research for allendale inc a futures brokerage in crystal lake 
ill 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 400 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with december at 240 a bushel 
oats were cent to cent higher with december at 144 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with november at 579 a 
bushel

family farmers who say they suffered severe 
financial losses from a chicago board of trade order last summer 
filed a federal classaction lawsuit tuesday accusing the exchange 
of illegally manipulating soybean prices 
the lawsuit seeking more than 100 million in damages was filed 
by individual farmers from leading soybeanproducing states and the 
american agriculture movement a lobbying group that represents 
small farmers and rural business people in 34 states 
the board of trade denied the allegations which stem from its 
emergency action july 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings 
in soybean futures contracts 
the order caused a 20 percent drop in soybean prices and 
corresponding declines in other commodities the aam said 
the boards move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an 
alleged attempt to corner the market by ferruzzi finanziaria spa 
an italian company and one of the worlds largest soybean 
processors 
the cbots order was a bad faith and selfserving action 
initiated by the cbots dominant grain merchants and futures 
traders to create profits for their accounts and for their 
clients said harvey joe sanner aams president and an arkansas 
soybean farmer 
sanner spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel 
accompanied by about 25 other farmers from illinois iowa 
missouri indiana minnesota ohio nebraska arkansas kansas and 
south dakota many of whom said they had been devastated by the 
board action 
im angry as hell about what has been done to we as producers 
of this nation said corky jones a soybean farmer from 
brownville neb and an aam member 
jones said the order caused us farmers in excess of a 50 
billion loss on corn and about 27 billion in beans 
the lawsuit names as defendants the exchange cbot chairman 
karsten mahlmann and 21 other directors and five other exchange 
officials 
after the news conference the group carrying banners and 
buckets of soybeans marched five blocks to the board of trade 
where they had hoped to meet with exchange officials 
cbot spokesman raymond carmichael said officials were in 
meetings and refused to let the farmers enter the building he 
agreed to take the soybeans to exchange officials as a symbol of 
their complaint 
in a news release mahlmann said exchange officials had not seen 
the lawsuit but are confident in the action taken by the 
board of directors to maintain an orderly liquidation in our july 
1989 soybean futures contract 
he said board officials expect this lawsuit to be proven 
frivolous and do not believe it will be of any benefit to the us 
agriculture community 
the commodity futures trading commission vindicated our action 
in their testimony before congress supporting the exchanges 
decision to maintain orderly markets he said 
the boards order required the liquidation of large positions in 
its july soybean futures contracts the exchange said it issued the 
order to make ferruzzi reduce its holdings in soybean futures 
contracts 
the board of trade was widely criticized by farm groups and 
traders who saw the value of their futures holdings drop when 
soybean futures prices fell sharply july 12 
aam attorney john arens said the lawsuit was filed on behalf of 
all farmers hurt by the order about 95 percent of the nations 
growers but that anyone can opt out if they choose

pressure from the investment group coniston 
partners is forcing ual corp toward a sale of the airline company 
possibly to a successor to the employeemanagement coalition that 
failed with an earlier bid analysts said tuesday 
coniston turned up the heat monday with the first formal step in 
its bid to oust 13 of the 15 ual directors 
uals board responded by reemphasizing its determination to 
maximize shareholder value and authorizing its financial adviser to 
explore potential transactions with third parties 
some industry analysts interpreted the companys statement as a 
clear indication that ual the parent of united airlines is for 
sale

churchillcoleman would not state categorically that it was the 
work of the ira but he said the ira had been carrying out a 
bombing campaign on the british mainland for 14 months and this 
appears to be that kind of device 
jason bradley a painter said he spotted an 18inchlong lunch 
box under a blue mercedes on monday while working at a house on the 
treelined street in the fashionable kensington district about a 
mile from kensington palace where prince charles and princess diana 
live 
it just instinctively struck me as suspicious there was 
something not quite right and i thought it best to call the 
police said bradley 19 
police evacuated the area for three hours while the bomb squad 
defused the device 
the owner of the mercedes turned out to be veravat chotiros the 
british manager of thai airways whose wife said the car had not 
been used for days 
quite obviously this was a case of mistaken identity 
chotiros said my family and i are much relieved that the device 
was detected and made safe and that no injuries resulted from the 
incident 
defense sources said the bombers were wrong on a second front 
ramsbotham based mainly at salisbury in southern england is 
chauffeured to the defense ministry in a military vehicle 
i think he realized that being a target was part of the job 
and just shrugged it off said lady brucegardyne who lives next 
door and whose husband john is a conservative party peer she 
said the general and his wife sue have not been home for two 
weeks 
ramsbotham commanded the 39th infantry brigade based at lisburn 
northern ireland between 1978 and 1980 he has been widely rumored 
to be up for the armys top job chief of the general staff 
the discovery fueled speculation of an ira prechristmas bombing 
campaign on the british mainland churchillcoleman warned those at 
risk to be extra vigilant particularly with their cars 
on sept 22 an ira bomb killed 11 men at the royal marines 
music school in deal on englands southeast coast 
the defense ministry stepped up security following an ira 
bombing at inglis barracks in north london in august 1988 in which 
one soldier was killed and nine injured 
but the ira carried out a triple bombing at a barracks near 
shrewsbury in western england on feb 20 slightly injuring one 
soldier 
on march 7 police discovered an arms and explosive cache near 
the seaside resort of scarborough in northeast england where prime 
minister margaret thatcher was to address a meeting of her

todays hottest computers are portable from 
onepound palmtops to hefty but highpowered 20pounders with 
handles sellers said tuesday at the worlds biggest computer trade 
show 
perhaps hottest of all at the comdex show are compaq computer 
corps sixpound notebooksize lte and lte286 machines 
sales have been very good i would say better than expected 
rod canion compaqs president and chief executive said in an 
interview 
compaqs machines are the first of their size to accept the 
3inch floppy disks that are standard in many desktop computers 
thats more convenient than other machines that use memory cards or 
smaller disks 
compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the 
month since they introduced the lte which begins at about 2400 
and the lte286 which runs on a faster 80286 microprocessor and 
lists for 3900 to 5000 
canion said the only compromise was on the screen which is less 
sharp than the one on apple computer incs 14pound macintosh 
portable 
what we found was that most people would trade off that 
screen in return for the small size canion said 
among the competing highperformance notebooksize computers is 
the nec ultralite a pioneer when it was introduced a year ago it 
weighs just 44 pounds has a bigger screen than the ltes and 
costs about the same with a basic list price of 2500 storage of 
information is on memory cards 
also hot are the onepound minimachines known as palmtops or 
breast pocket computers made by the atari and poqet corporations 
ataris portfolio which operates on two aa batteries for 48 
hours fits in a jacket pocket and sells for 400 not intended to 
rival its bigger and more expensive cousins it has five simple 
builtin programs 
at about 2000 poqets palmtop offers a bigger screen and 
keyboard all within the tiny package 
at the other extreme of the lightweight scale is dolch computer 
systems portable that uses intels new 80486 microprocessor 
the hottest most powerful chip in the world for personal computers 
the industriallooking dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds but 
company president volker dolch says it can compete in performance 
with very highend desktop computers and work stations he claims 
it is more than twice as fast as its closest competitor the 
toshiba 5200 
the potential buyers who dolch calls power users on the go 
will pay a premium for the privilege of lugging the computer 
around it ranges from about 13000 to 18000

said that delta plans considerable expansion during the 1990s and 
that jet purchases are a major part of the companys strategy 
we have a tremendous amount of growth planned ahead for delta 
air lines allen said many of these airplanes will be used to 
maintain a modern fleet to do that of course we have to keep 
replenishing our fleet and replacing our old airplanes 
he also said the plans make delta officials leery of any 
involvement in a debtfinanced takeover delta often is mentioned 
as an attractive acquisition target 
we want to be positioned to fly through a recession and to 
continue to grow through a recession allen said we have a big 
commitment to buy new airplanes we cannot maintain that

shearson lehman hutton inc said tuesday it was 
planning a major shakeup in senior management following a recent 
round of up to 800 layoffs slumping profits and a weak stock price 
the planned reorganization at shearson the secondlargest wall 
street firm behind merrill lynch amp co comes during a lean period 
throughout the securities industry 
but analysts said the spotlight on shearson stemmed largely from 
the 61 percent ownership of the company by american express co 
which reportedly wants to reduce its stake but wants shearson to be 
more profitable first 
shearson reported thirdquarter earnings of 66 million but 
most of that came from a onetime 77 million pretax gain from the 
sale of its lehman management co and investment banking fees from 
time incs acquisition of warner communications inc 
american express share of shearsons thirdquarter profit was 
41 million 
the company also was stung by news that its debt was being 
reviewed for possible downgrading and by an accounting scandal last 
year at its boston co moneymanagement unit 
american express is probably furious said perrin long a 
securities industry analyst with lipper analytical services with 
a 61 percent ownership its a drain on american express 
earnings 
a shearson spokesman said that under the reorganization the firm 
will promote a number of younger executives to more prominent 
positions and reassign others throughout the company to create a 
new identity for the brokerge firm 
the spokesman who asked that he not be identified said the 
reorganization will occur within several weeks and will broaden 
the management and bring along a new generation to ensure the 
company is managed as best as possible 
the process grows out of the fact that the company has grown 
and diversified for the past several years he said dont 
think of it in terms of the staff cutbacks from last week 
shearson began laying off some of its 38500 employees last 
monday and notified others in a twoparagraph newsletter that more 
acrosstheboard cuts were planned shearson cited among other 
things the slowdown of stock market activity since the 1987 stock 
market crash 
the company had declined to say exactly how many employees would 
lose their jobs but officials said privately that as many as 800 
people or 2 percent of the total work force could be cut that 
would be the largest staff reduction on wall street this year 
a year ago shearson laid off about 1200 employees since then 
it has trimmed 300 more jobs several other wall street firms also 
have retrenched in varying degrees this past year 
last month moodys investors service inc said it was reviewing 
the firms debt with an eye toward a possible downgrading the 
credit rating agency cited increased competition in the securities 
business and shearsons use of large sometimes risky shortterm 
bridge loans to finance takeovers and mergers

rjr nabisco holdings corp on tuesday reported a 
net loss of 447 million for the third quarter as income from its 
domestic cigarette business declined 
the loss compared with a net profit of 355 million or 155 a 
share in the third quarter of last year 
the consumer products giant was taken private in october 1988 in 
a 2453 billion leveraged buyout by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
therefore there are no pershare figures for the latest results 
revenue for the three months ended sept 30 was 3 billion down 
from 32 billion a year earlier 
the company said strong performances by its food and foreign 
tobacco businesses were more than offset by the decline in its 
domestic cigarette income caused by a program to eliminate excess 
inventories 
inventories became inflated because of a practice known as trade 
loading in which the company essentially induced wholesale 
customers to buy more product in this case cigarettes then they 
could quickly resell 
rjr nabisco decided earlier this year to end the practice also 
used by other domestic cigarette makers and in other industries 
the practice effectively overstated operating profits in rjr 
nabiscos tobacco division by some 250 million in recent years 
the company said 
unit sales of cigarettes have been declining in the united 
states helping to bloat inventories that then had to be scaled 
back when the company decided to end the practice 
rjr nabisco made substantial progress in the third quarter 
chairman louis v gerstner jr said in a statement excluding 
our decision to reduce us tobacco trade inventories our food and 
tobacco businesses showed excellent earnings growth 
gerstner said the company is ahead of schedule in its program to 
divest assets 
rjr nabisco recently announced an agreement to sell its baby 
ruth butterfinger and pearson candy businesses to nestle foods 
corp for around 370 million it also agreed to sell its nabisco 
food businesses in spain and portugal to a spanish company for 
775 million 
the latest sales brought the company close to its goal of 
divesting 55 billion in assets to raise cash and reduce debt 
amassed in the leveraged buyout 
rjr nabiscos products include oreo cookies ritz crackers and 
winston cigarettes its major subsidiaries are rj reynolds 
tobacco co rj reynolds tobacco international inc nabisco 
brands inc and planters lifesavers co 
in the first nine months of the year the company posted a net 
loss of 101 billion compared with a net profit of 980 million 
or 414 a share in the same period in 1988 
ninemonth revenue rose to 92 billion from 91 billion a year 
earlier 
in line with the divestiture program the nabisco international 
and del monte foods businesses have been treated as discontinued 
operations in both the thirdquarter and ninemonth results

the senate on tuesday overwhelmingly approved 
a threeyear 738 million aid package to reinforce efforts by 
poland and hungary to discard communism and build democracy and 
free enterprise 
the vote was 990 
the senate action came on the eve of an address to a joint 
meeting of congress by lech walesa leader of polands solidarity 
labor union who is seeking a massive infusion of western aid to 
energize his countrys battered economy and shore up its flegling 
democracy 
lech walesa this is for you and a free poland said sen 
paul simon dill immediately after the senate acted 
this bill gives solidarity a fighting chance to succeed 
said simon who was the bills principal democratic sponsor 
polish democracy deserves our firm support simon said to 
this point our words have generally outstripped our deeds this 
will help change that 
it almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in 
eastern europe is mindboggling but thank god for it said sen 
gordon humphrey rnh as the senates work on the bill neared 
completion 
we must do all we can afford as quickly as we can to help 
make these changes in eastern europe irreversible humphrey said 
the senate bill represents a bipartisan compromise over the 
scale of the aid plan an issue that has been contentious from the 
start 
senate democrats originally had sought a threeyear 
authorization level for the two east european nations of 989 
million while republicans campaigned for a 585 million ceiling 
all the proposals including the 840 million authorized earlier 
by the house overshadow the total 455 million proposed in 
increments over the last several months by president bush 
asked if bush favors 738 million in aid for the two countries 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said were generally 
supportive wed like to get billions if we had them 
the house meanwhile provided the first hard cash to back up 
the aid made possible by the senate authorization bill lawmakers 
passed a foreign aid appropriations measure for the 1990 fiscal 
year that included 293 million for the first year of the 
threeyear aid program along with another 240 million in standby 
credit and trade insurance 
major elements of the appropriations measure included a 200 
million grant to help stabilize polands battered economy and 45 
million for a private enterprise development fund other money 
would go for environmental cleanup agriculture and educational and 
cultural exchanges 
however the money bill the product of a housesenate 
conference remained the subject of a veto threat over unrelated 
provisions which the bush administration opposes 
the senate authorization bill builds on key elements originally 
advocated by the bush including enterprise funds to help both 
nations move away from communist centralized economies toward 
freemarket systems 
the enterprise funds intended to help both countries establish 
freemarket systems would allocate 260 million for poland and 65 
million for hungary 
in recognition of polands serious economic problems the bill 
allocates 657 million for that country over three years hungary 
would receive 81 million 
the senate compromise plan drops a 200 million credit 
stabilization plan for poland which republicans said would only 
increase polands large foreign debt 
the only senator not voting for the aid plan was spark 
matsunaga dhawaii who is ill

savings and loan regulators undermined a 
securities investigation linked to the nations largest savings and 
loan failure the head of the securities and exchange commission 
said tuesday at a hearing where tearful elderly witnesses told of 
losing their life savings 
sec chairman richard c breeden told the house banking committee 
that a memorandum of understanding between the federal home 
loan bank board and lincoln savings and loan association irvine 
calif gave lincolns parent company a powerful legal tool to 
resist the secs probe 
the sec was trying to determine if the parent company american 
continental corp headed by phoenix ariz millionaire charles h 
keating jr had filed false financial statements 
however breeden said the may 20 1988 memorandum of 
understanding said in essence that the financial statements were 
all right and allowed american continental to argue that the 
secs investigation should be dropped 
american continental continued to sell its subordinated debt 
which has proved to be worthless through lincolns 29 branches 
until early this year witnesses told the house panel in the fifth 
of six scheduled hearings on lincolns collapse 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board now called the 
office of thrift supervision said the memorandum in no way could 
have impeded the sec investigation theyre independent 
theres nothing we can do to get in the way he said 
in sometimes tearful testimony victims of the failure 
including a partially blind widow and the mother of a braindamaged 
daughter said in large part they blamed sen alan cranston 
dcalif for their plight 
cranston and four other senators are under fire for accepting 
large political contributions from keating before meeting on his 
behalf with sampl regulators in april 1987 
i had no idea this man could be so corrupted said shirley 
lampel a tustin calif widow who testified that an american 
continental employee eagerly offered to drive her to lincoln so she 
could invest her life savings 30000 in the holding companys 
subordinated debt which is repayable only after other debts are 
satisfied 
because she could not see well enough to read the prospectus or 
the agreement she signed mrs lampel said the employee summarized 
it for her but did not mention any risk or loss 
mrs lampel and most of the 23000 other lincoln customers who 
purchased 250 million in subordinated debt said they thought they 
were purchasing the equivalent of a federally insured certificate 
of deposit 
another victim ramona e jacobs of glendale calif said 
american continental employees assured her the 11000 in 
subordinated debt she purchased was secured the money included 
part of an insurance settlement paid after an automobile accident 
left her 23yearold daughter brain damaged 
murray flander a spokesman for cranston said we have 
nothing but compassion for these people 
cranston didnt know there had been a bond sale until he 
read about it newspapers after lincoln was closed down flander 
said 
breeden told the committee that the sec did not have enough 
evidence by the spring of 1988 t stop american continental from 
issuing the subordinated debt but is now reexamining its policies 
and the law to see if changes are needed 
he said he has doubled the number of staff members assigned to 
investigate lincoln matters related to the investigation have 
already been presented to a federal grand jury in los angeles he 
said confirming newspaper reports 
in next weeks lincoln hearing keating and m danny wall head 
of the office of thrift supervision are scheduled to testify 
after that rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the 
committee said he intended to investigate sampl scandals beyond 
lincoln later he told a reporter the probe would include the 
failure of silverado savings in colorado on whose board neal bush 
the presidents son once served 
in another development senate banking committee chairman donald 
w riegle jr dmich who has played down his connection to 
keating toured phoenix real estate projects funded by lincoln a 
trade publication said tuesday 
the previously undisclosed visit in march 1987 included a 
helicopter trip to the phoenician hotel a lavish resort then under 
construction by keating and a visit to american continental where 
the senator gave a speech to employees the american banker 
reported 
the visit occured around the time that keating was lobbying 
vigorously for relief from regulations that limited sampls direct 
investment in real estate and other speculative commercial ventures 
karolyn wallace a spokeswoman for riegle said the senator made 
the visit because american continental owned a hotel and other 
property in downtown detroit and he considered them an important 
michigan business constituent

a regional bargaining committee for striking 
telephone workers tuesday agreed to endorse a framework for a 
settlement that could end a 14weekold strike against nynex 
it is our hope that we can quickly resolve the remaining 
sticking points back at the bargaining tables jan pierce a vice 
president with the communications workers of america said at a 
news conference 
pierce who heads the regional committee cautioned that some 
remaining local issues could be stumbling blocks as serious as 
those resolved regionally we have miles to go before we sleep 
he said 
bargaining was to resume wednesday the union has agreed to a 
selfimposed deadline of midnight friday for negotiating regional 
and local issues eleven committees are discussing local issues 
any tentative agreement would have be ratified by monday which 
would be the earliest time employees could come back to work 
we are happy that we have this understanding and we feel that 
it is a fair settlement said john bonomo a nynex spokesman 
the cwa representing 40000 workers at new york telephone and 
20000 international brotherhood of electrical workers members at 
new england telephone struck parent nynex on aug 6 
the dispute is the last of a series of strikes by 200000 
workers in 20 states against baby bell regional phone companies 
the settlement offer came out of 19 hours of weekend talks 
the sticking issue for nynex union members had been the proposed 
shifting of health costs to workers ranging from weekly premiums 
to 1500 in yearly family deductibles 
cwa president morton bahr announced monday in washington that 
the health benefits issue had been resolved and that the framework 
for a total settlement had been outlined 
the settlement called for the company to assume all health 
benefits costs but that was traded for the dropping of a lumpsum 
bonus and a profitsharing plan 
new york telephone spokesman tony pappas said the 388 million 
package would raise wages 3 percent in the first year and 15 
percent in each of the second and third years with a cost of living 
allowance in each year 
some of the local issues remaining include the hiring of 
nonunion personnel and concessionary demands by nynex pierce 
said those include extending the work week on some jobs from 30 
hours to 37 hours at the same pay rate and eliminating premium 
pay for overtime 
one issue that appeared to be resolvable was the dismissal of 59 
people during the walkout pierce said union and management 
leaders agreed to review those cases he said 
in addition a committee composed of pierce and possibly new 
york telephone president frederic salerno will review how to fight 
spiraling health costs 
pierce said that if costs cant be contained the issue will 
come up again when the contract expires in three years 
nynex chairman william c ferguson said in a statement that the 
offer was a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issues 
facing not only our company but the entire nation 
while negotiators met off and on for months more than 500 acts 
of vandalism were reported nynex offered 100000 for information 
on the sabotage 
last week two telephone cables were cut leaving up to 361000 
customers temporarily without service in southeastern new york 
state 
the strike delayed directory assistance repairs and 
installations for nynexs 105 million customers in new york two 
cities in connecticut rhode island massachusetts new hampshire 
vermont and maine 
nynex blamed a thirdquarter fall in profits of 148 percent 
partly on the strike 
one union member died after a confrontation aug 15 at a nynex 
office in suburban westchester county police said the man jumped 
on the hood of a womans car pounded her windshield then fell off 
and struck his head the union charges the driver struck the man as 
she sped to work

survey 
the survey published in the novemberdecember issue of the 
magazine drew responses from about 1150 readers the magazine has 
a readership of about 200000 with a large portion occupying high 
management positions at companies

said alan webber the magazines managing editor 
about 96 percent of the respondents said the united states has a 
serious competitiveness problem with its asian rivals of those who 
said there is a problem 85 percent said the situation is getting 
worse 
furthermore just over half of the respondents said their own 
company has a competitiveness problem and of those people 83 
percent said the problem is getting worse 
when asked to point to a reason for the trouble fewer than 25 
percent of the respondents ranked high interest rates or federal 
antitrust laws as being very important 
instead many complained about a shortterm strategy taken by 
many us managers while japanese managers take more of a 
longterm approach 
about half of the respondents said restrictive japanse trade 
practices are very important in causing competition problems

california connecticut and colorado when the contract was canceled 
a year early has its own 6 million claim pending against the 
federal government 
under a twoyear contract signed in may 1986 with the federal 
general services administration meredith agreed to buy homes and 
perform other relocation services for transferred federal workers 
in 24 central and western states the government estimated the 
value of the contract at 1033 million 
the contract was canceled after one year following a government 
audit that the government said disclosed meredith intimidated 
appraisers to lower the valuations of federal employees homes the 
justice department claims that efforts by meredith to obtain lower 
appraisals resulted in delays in the sales of the homes forcing 
employees into accepting distressed prices 
the classaction suit makes similar claims it seeks unspecified 
actual and punitive damages

automakers and proponents of electrically 
powered vehicles touted their wares tuesday and predicted a future 
when motorists will charge up rather than fill their tanks 
about 200 people including representatives of two major 
american auto manufacturers gathered to gawk at and drive 
prototypes of the first electric vehicles to be produced in 
conjuction with the american car industry 
one vehicle the gvan which will be marketed by general motors 
corp is scheduled to begin production next year another vehicle 
chryslers tevan is expected to be available in 1992 or 1993 
the conference was sponsored by the electric power research 
institute the research and development arm of the electric utility 
industry which also helped developed the two vehicles 
from the outside the electric vans look like their 
petroleumpowered counterparts and their proponents claim they 
handle like gasolinepowered vans as well but instead of a 
conventional engine and gears the electric vans operate on a 
batterydriven motor that can be recharged by plugging into an 
electrical outlet 
we dont want to suggest this is going to turn around 
overnight but we think it will provide an alternative said 
richard e balzhiser president of the electric power research 
institute which has been working on electrically powered vehicles 
since 1979 
despite progress the driving range of the electric vehicles 
remains limited when compared to conventional automobiles 
in the gvan for example which is expected to sell initially 
for about 32500 the leadacid battery will run for about 60 
miles without recharging the tevan which has no suggested retail 
price as yet will use a nickeliron battery and have a range of 
about 120 miles both batteries will take about eight hours to 
recharge manufacturers said 
the top speed for the gvan is about 52 miles per hour while 
the tevan will top off at about 65 the designers said 
instead of the growl of conventional engines the electric car 
produces a low hum 
after the initial shock of the different noises everything is 
basically the same said dave harris of chloride ltd one of 
the companies involved in manufacturing the gvan people get a 
little bit thrown when they touch the gas pedal and theyre waiting 
for the engine to rev 
electric industry officials were ready with a laundry list of 
reasons why americans should push development of the vehicles 
besides the fact that it would open a vast new market for 
electric power experts said electric vehicles would reduce 
emissions that threaten the environment with ozone and carbon 
monoxide 
replacing 1 million gasoline cars with electric cars would cut 
down emissions by 150 million tons a year said balzhiser 
a car that runs without gasoline also could reduce the united 
states dependence on foreign oil imports since electricity can be 
generated through several means including hydro coal and nuclear 
power said john e deegan a senior vice president of consolidated 
edison co of new york 
ken winters of penstar electronics a chrysler subsidiary 
estimated electric vehicles would corner 10 to 20 percent of the 
market for commercial vehicles by the second half of the 1990s 
response to the cars from conference participants varied greatly 
the most promising stage of electric vehicles for commercial 
use that ive seen in the 25 years ive been in the business is 
this said victor wouk an electric vehicle consultant from new 
york they seem to have solved the major problems that existed in 
the past 
but mark a reedy of wisconsin electric said his utility had no 
immediate plans to buy any 
we have some skepticism he said weve had some electric 
vehicles in our service areas before and they havent really 
performed adequately were just waiting to see how all this shakes 
itself out 
jerry mader president of the electric vehicle development 
corp said he was optimistic about future sales 
he said the corporation has received orders for 185 electric 
vehicles since september when it began soliciting business from 
600 utilities across the country

two japanese industry groups are sending a trade 
mission to the united states to promote purchases of americanmade 
semiconductors the groups announced wednesday 
about 85 representatives of about 40 japanese companies will 
participate in the 10day mission which begins dec 6 the 
electronic industries association of japan and the japan auto parts 
industries association said 
us semiconductor makers have charged that they have not been 
allowed equal access to the japanese market and that japanese 
companies have not done enough to promote purchases of foreign 
semiconductor chips 
but the us semiconductor industry association a trade group 
said last week that japanese companies and government agencies have 
begun making serious efforts in recent months to increase sales of 
foreign chips 
foreign semiconductors account for about 112 percent of the 
japanese market far short of a 20 percent goal mentioned in 
negotiations for a 1986 usjapan semiconductor agreement 
the trade mission will begin with three days of meetings with 
us suppliers in santa clara calif followed by visits to 
factories the electronic industries association said 
the japanese mission follows a semiconductor sales mission to 
japan last june sponsored by the us department of commerce 
the electronic industries association last week offered to share 
information about highdefinition television with us 
semiconductor makers to allow them to produce chips for a 
japanesedeveloped hdtv system
