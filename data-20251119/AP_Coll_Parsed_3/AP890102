the jury is still out on ronald reagan but 
history is likely to regard him as an average to good president 
according to some scholars of the presidency 
with little time left in reagans final term the associated 
press interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists 
in history political science and social psychology 
their tentative verdict reagan will get high marks for his use 
of the white house pulpit to unite the country and will get credit 
for improving eastwest relations even though soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev may have been more responsible for it than he 
my view is that he will be viewed by the american people as an 
aboveaverage president said thomas cronin a historian of the 
presidency at colorado college who calls himself a moderate 
democrat i think the historians and biographers will treat him a 
little bit more harshly still ranking him at least an average 
president but not as high as the american people now do or will 
but daniel franklin a professor of political science at colgate 
university who is critical of many reagan policies said i think 
in the historical sense somewhere down the road that reagan will 
be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of 
the problems that he has left us 
if the economy turns sour in the wake of his administrations 
record budget and trade deficits reagan may go down in history like 
calvin coolidge as a president who failed to take action to stave 
off coming disaster 
some scholars said reagans reputation will also suffer from 
scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal 
effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless 
i think probably in the short range reaction in the next five 
or 10 years even liberal and radical historians will find something 
good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a 
kind of quality of americanism and a sense of national unity and he 
projected that from the white house said herman belz a 
neoconservative historian at the university of maryland 
whether or not in the long run our relations with the soviets 
will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall 
of 1988 under ronald reagan i dont know but it would certainly 
look that way said vaughn davis bornet professor emeritus of 
history at southern oregon state college and a selfdescribed 
moderate republican 
edward w chester a conservative historian at the university of 
texas said it is too early to evaluate reagan but echoing many of 
his academic colleagues he said the deficit does bother me the 
deficit does bother me 
i think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon 
him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he 
brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for 
a renewed sense of national pride said charles w dunn a former 
republican congressional aide who teaches political science at 
clemson university and has written widely on the presidency 
austin ranney chairman of the department of political science at 
the university of california at berkeley said on just the 
externalities of it i think reagans presidency with one huge 
if will probably go down as one of the most successful ones 
certainly in this century and maybe ever 
however comparing reagan with one of the predecessors the 
president most admires ranney also said that reagan may go down 
in history pretty much the way coolidge did if some economists 
predictions of economic collapse come true 
coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by 
hoover a bum but as a president whose donothing policies led to 
the huge crash of the early 30s that hoover was the victim of he 
said 
dean keith simonton a professor of psychology at the university 
of california at davis who has devised a formula for predicting how 
history will rate presidents said when you put all the pros and 
all the cons in the equation ronald reagan comes out as a slightly 
above average president 
one of the pro factors for reagan said simonton is the 
improvement in ussoviet relations that he and gorbachev have 
forged 
he gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he 
didnt take the initiative for that simonton said 
in all fairness gorbachev deserves more credit than he does 
said colorado colleges cronin 
still said southern oregons bornet ronald reagan stepped 
forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and thats going 
to be hard to erase ill tell you 
clemsons dunn similarly argued a good leader also must 
seize the opportunity and gorbachev offered an opportunity to play 
for high stakes in the international arena he seized that he was 
not frozen in place by rigid ideology and thus i think one has to 
give him credit 
from berkeley ranny said the relaxation of eastwest tensions 
was the most important of reagans accomplishments in foreign policy 
now you might say thats because he got lucky and had gorbachev 
there and i wouldnt quarrel with that he said nevertheless 
it did happen and i think when historians look back at that they 
will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most 
successful postwar presidents that we have had 
psychologist simonton said one big factor working in reagans 
favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since 
dwight eisenhower to serve eight years 
the longer you serve the more events happen that can be 
credited to you whether or not you are responsible for them he 
said you make a thick chapter in the history of america under 
your name 
although reagan recently pictured himself as the adversary of a 
washington colony protecting special interests at the expense of 
ordinary citizens some scholars argued that one of his own chief 
shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the 
outside

there will be a feeling that he was largely indifferent to 
those without voice in washington that he responded much more to 
upper middle class and middle class america said cronin the 
presidency ought to be a place which raises its voice on behalf of 
those who dont have the powerful lobbies 
cronin is selfdescribed as a democrat with a liberal viewpoint 
compared with reagans but the more conservative chester agreed 
i also think reagan could perhaps have done more for the 
homeless 
the irancontra affair and the investigations and indictments 
that have marked reagans administration also will cast their 
shadow the scholars said 
the people will forget that quickly the historians wont 
said cronin the historians will have chapters on the sleaze stuff 
and theyll call it as bad or equal to the watergate mess 
some who praised reagan highly on other grounds conceded he was 
not as attentive as he should have been to his duties 
he didnt keep his ear to the ground enough and he didnt have 
enough interest in political life the warp and woof of it to do as 
good a job as he could have said the neoconservative belz 
in strikingly similar language ranny said i imagine he loses 
a few points because of the large number of scandals and indictments 
and things like that and simonton said that he is probably 
going to get some negative points because of such troubles 
in comparing reagan with past presidents scholars cited the 
names ranging from eisenhower to lyndon johnson 
personality and character issues for 20 years have overwhelmed 
evaluation of lyndon johnson as president and if thats any 
precedent then maybe for several decades it will be difficult to 
get down to serious business with ronald reagan said bornet who 
has written extensively on johnson 
johnson he said is still the crude cornpone president and 
reagan is going to continue to be for a long time this image people 
watched on tv and this person the press correctly portrayed as 
essentially a lazy president 
as for eisenhower he has undergone a reevaluation in recent 
years with scholars believing him a much more activist president 
than first believed ranney said if future scholarship finds out 
that behind the scenes and when the truth is known reagan himself 
was also a much more handson active president than we now believe 
and incidentally it is unlikely that they will find that he might 
undergo the same kind of upgrading 
dunn however said definitely a comparison of eisenhower and 
reagan is in order eisenhower had a very subtle style of leadership 
that evidently caused him to lead more effectively than most people 
thought he was leading reagans leadership i dont think will come 
off as that kind of subtle hidden hand leadership so much as it has 
been leadership through orchestration of symbols and movement of the 
public mind 
on the other hand the clemson political scientist said reagan 
may also be in for the kind of scaling down of his reputation that 
john f kennedy has suffered as the force of his personality recedes 
there is no longer the camelot mystique to kennedy a lot of 
that has worn off he said i suspect that with ronald reagan 
there will be a little bit of wearing off of the mystique that 
surrounds him

where most people list their job 
experiences operation rescue founder randall terrys resume brags 
arrested 26 times in seven cities 
terry complains its outofdate 
it might be closer to 30 right now the 29yearold activist 
said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in 
upstate new york where the latest protests against abortion are 
being planned 
since its national debut at the democratic national convention in 
atlanta last summer operation rescue has made abortion a 
highprofile issue again 
terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion 
clinics throughout the country lying in front of doors until police 
carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras 
terry says he is trying to produce the social tension 
necessary to change abortion laws by using the nonviolent 1960s 
civil rights protest as a model 
hes the martin luther king of a movement said dominick 
brignola an albany lawyer and footsoldier in the antiabortion 
drive 
terrys critics claim operation rescue so named because 
followers try to rescue the unborn is an assault on womens 
rights 
the civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people 
theyre trying to take away the rights of living breathing human 
beings said molly yard president of the national organization 
for women 
more than 450 antiabortion demonstrators clogged atlanta jails 
during the fiveday democratic convention since then 
demonstrations have spread to new york city indianapolis 
milwaukee detroit philadelphia and boston and still more cities 
the activists want the supreme court to overturn roe vs wade 
its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions an estimated 
16 million women have abortions each year in the united states 
standing at the forefront of operation rescue is a used car 
salesman who once wanted to be a rock star 
terry and his wife cindy began their crusade in 1984 by 
standing in front of abortion clinics trying to talk women out of 
entering friends soon joined them and the couple opened an office 
that offered women free pregnancy tests and handmedown baby 
clothes 
god clicked a light on in my head and said it wasnt enough to 
just be against childkilling that i had to do something about 
it said terry whos selling his auto dealership because he is 
too busy with operation rescue 
critics concede terry has a mesmerizing personality he even 
tries to convert relatives at family reunions said dawn marvin of 
rochester his aunt 
terry was reared in a lowkey protestant environment but quit 
high school at 17 dreaming of a career in music said marvin who 
is communications director for the rochester chapter of planned 
parenthood a medical service that antiabortion pickets frequently 
target she stressed that she does not speak for the organization 
about her nephew 
he went away and he flipped out she said about terrys 
transformation into a bornagain christian he came back a totally 
changed personality it was more like a cult reaction than a 
spiritual quest 
marriage and his highly public role as operation rescue spokesman 
have calmed him somewhat she said the terrys have one child and 
three foster children 
terry dismisses his aunts comments including her assessment 
that hes an egomaniac lapping up news media attention 
to margaret johnston administrator at southern tier womens 
services in binghamton operation rescue is nothing new she said 
antiabortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and 
glued the clinics door shut four or five times 
terrys first arrest came in january 1986 when he chained himself 
to a sink at the clinic which performs abortions he was jailed for 
22 days for refusing to pay a 60 fine 
it doesnt matter what you say to him there is no reason 
involved johnston said he doesnt care about women i think he 
really hates women 
iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the 
binghamton clinic a court order keeps the nearly everpresent 
demonstrators at shouting distance 
they really want to make it personal johnston said 
even when she has run into him on a saturday in the post office 
johnston said terry has shouted at her how many babies did you 
murder today 
terry criticizes the antiabortion movement as being too nice 
during the 1980s pacified by the presence of an ideological friend 
like president reagan into not working hard for its goal 
we cry that abortion is murder its childkilling and yet we 
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters he 
said thats not an adequate response to murder a logical 
response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the 
victim 
the lean bushyhaired terry expects and even hopes his 
demonstrators will be arrested he claims operation rescue was 
responsible for 11000 arrests in 1988 and predicts 500000 will be 
arrested in 1989 
there are no situations he said when abortions are justified 
in most areas of life its ok for people to follow their own 
beliefs but not when it comes to having innocent children 
murdered he said 
thats like saying why cant a white man follow his own 
conscience concerning owning a black slave why cant a german 
follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot jews 
terry has attracted some prominent supporters including former 
presidential candidate pat robertson who said he backs any means 
short of violence to stop abortion 
if antiabortion demonstrators set their minds to it terry said 
they could change abortion laws in six months because the political 
system is not built to deal with mass protests 
yard dismisses terry as a puppet groomed for the role of 
point man in the latest antiabortion offensive 
women are really outraged by the whole thing she said the 
reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings of 
abortion clinics and operation rescue is that people dont believe 
roe vs wade can be overturned im not so sanguine all i know 
is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can 
at operation rescues office a competing outcry is being plotted 
pinned to the wall is a large map of the united states with 
abortion mills dotted in red terry distractedly complains to a 
staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will 
take him to a television appearance 
as a photographer snaps pictures he removes his foot from his 
desk saying thats too casual for someone trying to change world 
history 
he adds chuckling its comical really i think god has a 
sense of humor dont you think its rather funny that a former used 
car salesman is heading such a movement

faced with the choice of trying to kick heroin or 
going back to jail jon parker fought his way 14 years ago from the 
murky world of bostons shooting galleries to the academic heights 
of yale university 
now hes back on the streets he again faces a possible jail 
term but this time hes charged with illegally handing out clean 
needles to people he used to run with many of whom already have 
contracted aids by sharing dirty needles 
parker 33 said he doesnt want to go to jail but hes willing 
to risk it to try to change the massachusetts requirement for a 
prescription to buy a hypodermic syringe 
people look down on addicts but its through them that aids is 
going to spread to the heterosexual community he says people 
are going to have to realize that 
parker is founder of a 50member organization called the aids 
brigade which includes yale graduate students as well as former 
addicts and convicts it was formed about four years ago and 
distributes aids education materials bleach and needles in new 
haven conn new york city new jersey and boston 
critics say hes a renegade too far from mainstream efforts to 
curb the spread of aids most often transmitted through homosexual 
contact and shared needles 
i think clean needles clearly is one way of addressing the 
problem for addicts it would be nice if they were available but 
theyre not so we do what we can through other aspects said 
brianne comella director of project trust supported by city and 
state funds 
project trust volunteers distribute bottles of bleach and show 
addicts how to sterilize needles 
i think that there is an absolute need for fringe groups such 
as the aids brigade to push the system unfortunately i think that 
they could be more effective if they worked with existing programs 
rather than as lone rangers ms commella said 
state health officials estimate there are about 40000 addicts in 
massachusetts and about onethird are believed to be carrying the 
aids virus 
mayor raymond flynn backed a needle exchange program but it was 
rejected by the city council 
dr george a lamb first deputy commissioner for the boston 
department of health and hospitals supported the attempt at a 
needle exchange program and said he will testify at parkers trial 
which he hopes will revive interest in the program 
addicts meet aids brigade workers in dingy restaurants and on 
street corners to get their sets of needles known as the works 
parker makes rounds of the neighborhoods where the people he 
tries to help live such as jenny who used to shoot dope with 
parker 18 years ago but now is trying to stay clean 
a thin pale woman in her 30s with dark circles under her eyes 
jenny spoke at her apartment on condition her last name wasnt used 
she tested positive for the aids virus last summer and shes sure 
she contracted the disease through sharing dirty needles the 
works are hard to get jenny says 
parker was arrested this summer and charged with illegal 
possession of hypodermic syringes which he buys legally in vermont 
the charge is a misdemeanor but parker requested a jury trial 
which will probably take place this spring 
i want to show that this is the logical answer to stop the 
spread of aids parker said 
his attorney arnold abelow plans a necessity defense 
saying that illegally handing out the needles is justified by the 
need to curb aids 
but prosecutors say having a reason for doing something doesnt 
excuse an offense 
were only kidding ourselves to think addicts are going to go 
out and only use the needle once said first assistant attorney 
paul leary of the suffolk county district attorneys office 
parker says his personal history makes him a better judge of how 
addicts are likely to respond 
he shot heroin as a teenager and robbed drug stores for money 
and supplies at 17 he served more than two years time earning his 
high school equivalency diploma in jail a month after his release 
in 1974 he was caught violating parole and given the choice of 
checking into a drug rehabilitation center or going back to jail 
he chose reform 
since then parker has worked a variety of jobs including 
driving a cab and a few bouts as a local boxer to get money to help 
pay his way through hampshire college in amherst where he studied 
biology and then to yales school of epidemiology and public 
health where he is completing work on a masters degree in public 
health 
he says he wants other addicts to have the same chance he did

uniformed men beat up cecilio 
aguilar beneath an avocado tree marched him and two friends down a 
wooded path and pounded them to death with rifle butts witnesses 
say 
leftist guerrillas captured francisco diaz as he was searching 
for three wayward cows took him away and shot him 
the killings are examples of the growing toll of politically 
motivated slayings in el salvador in 1988 as both sides in a 
9yearold civil war grow frustrated with a stalemate 
the roman catholic churchs legal aid office has counted 181 
summary killings in the first 11 months of 1988 compared with 129 
in all of 1987 
catholic archbishop arturo rivera damas said during his homily 
sunday that altogether 1369 civilians soldiers or leftist rebels 
were killed last year in military clashes rightist death squad 
operations and car bombings or other terrorist acts the war has 
claimed an estimated 65000 lives since it began 
it is so hard to see any sort of light said a church worker 
who has spent nearly two decades in morazan an eastern province 
divided between guerrillas and government forces 
its so disheartening because you had the feeling things were 
getting better and now you feel them going backward getting 
worse the worker said on condition he not be identified 
when the uniformed men had finished killing cecilio they went 
back to his house to demand food and his weapon his mother could 
give them only tortillas 
they said he was a guerrilla but my son had no weapon only a 
machete said dominga aguilar in her oneroom mud brick home she 
recounted through sobs the events of nov 12 when men she described 
as government soldiers swept into this hamlet 
francisco diaz was the former mayor of another small town 
lolotique 12 miles from piedra luna he was searching for cows with 
his brother dec 6 when leftist guerrillas captured him his wife 
said they killed him for what they said was his complicity in a 
usimposed counterinsurgency plan 
the cases in lolotique and piedra luna a village of a dozen 
households 90 miles east of san salvador are not unique 
respect for human rights improved steadily from 1984 until 1988 
the early 1980s were a time of slaughter when soldiers and rightist 
death squads were blamed for the slayings of about 30000 people 
the united states which has provided more than 3 billion in aid 
this decade told salvadoran authorities in 1983 that support would 
dry up if the rights situation did not improve salvadoran 
authorities say the government no longer has any ties with 
rightwing death squads 
the leftist guerrillas have killed eight mayors and 32 other 
civilians in 1988 for allegedly collaborating with the army 
the catholic legal aid office blames the army for 90 summary 
executions of suspected guerrilla collaborators death squads are 
blamed for 51 murders 
the slayings of aguilar 17 hernan benitez 18 and dolores 
pineda 24 devastated their families the community council they 
all sat on and the village soccer team 
benitez was the goalie aguilar a fullback and pineda a 
midfielder benitez died with his soccer shoes on 
i wont play ever again his mother amalia quoted him as 
saying as he laced up the cleats before being taken away 
he knew he lifted the dogs front paws and danced with him he 
kissed the baby and said this is it ma im saying goodbye 
she said 
those who took them away were government soldiers six witnesses 
said hernans mother said the officer in charge repeatedly accused 
the family of setting corn aside for the guerrillas 
arturo rivera damas archbishop of san salvador also has blamed 
army troops for the piedra luna killings and called for an 
investigation 
lt col oscar leon linares denied army responsibility he blamed 
the guerrillas claiming they wanted to discredit the armed forces 
he said army records show no troops near piedra luna on nov 12 
he denied a request to see the records saying they were classified 
he said the case is closed 
aguilars 15yearold brother has been a guerrilla for a year 
mrs aguilar said benitezs father was detained for four days in 
october and according to his family he was severely beaten and 
accused of guerrilla sympathies 
the three young men though perhaps not outright collaborators 
maintained friendly relations with rebels who pass through 
regularly villagers said the community council they sat on 
functions with tacit guerrilla approval 
when the guerrillas kill civilians they usually announce it on 
their clandestine radio venceremos 
the radio announced dec 9 that diaz the former mayor was found 
guilty of crimes against the people he was the 
secretarygeneral of the governing christian democratic party in 
lolotique 
he had been kidnapped by the guerrillas for five months in 1985 
we explained to him how mayors are tools for the implementation 
of the counterinsurgency plan but he did not obey and continued 
implementing the plan in lolotique said the broadcast 
he helped whomever he could said his widow blanca in their 
home the room where she sat contained a sort of shrine a crucifix 
and her husbands photograph surrounded by flowers in coffee cans 
maybe they killed him for helping the community she said a 
tear tracking down her cheek

when a us ambassador sat down with a 
plo delegation for the first official meeting in 13 years sweden 
scored a triumph for a foreign policy variously described as 
magnanimous or meddlesome 
for a small country sweden is engaged in other peoples troubles 
to a surprising degree 
some people call it international meddling or giving 
unsolicited advice said pierre schori the cabinet secretary who 
is the foreign ministrys no 2 official but sweden sees its 
foreign diplomacy as central to its own wellbeing 
our security has not only to do with our borders it also is 
affected by the international climate schori said 
increasingly neutral sweden is being used as a communications 
channel for parties who cant talk to each other 
on dec 16 the same day the us ended its formal boycott of the 
plo swedens ambassador to syria rolf gauffin was instrumental in 
mediating the release of peter winkler a red cross delegate who was 
kidnapped nov 17 by a palestinian faction in lebanon 
swedens approach to world affairs sometimes criticized as 
moralistic and preaching has created some ill feeling particularly 
in israel but also in the united states 
the late prime minister olof palme was blacklisted from the white 
house for his outspoken opposition to the vietnam war after he 
marched through stockholm with north vietnamese leaders 
we believe strongly in human rights international law and the 
resolution of conflicts schori said in an interview in his 
vaulted 18th century office our actions are motivated by a 
combination of selfinterest and solidarity 
the usplo dialogue was a personal victory for foreign minister 
sten andersson who worked in secret for nine months to nudge 
palestinian liberation organization chief yasser arafat to meet us 
conditions for ending its ban on contacts with his organization 
the plo success was the climax of a long process schori 
said but the positions were blocked and what was needed was a 
midwife somebody had to take the initiative sten andersson saw 
that 
andersson a wily politician with little foreign experience came 
to the foreign ministry in 1985 after nearly 20 years as secretary 
of the dominant social democratic party and three years as health 
minister 
he brought with him the typically swedish approach that any 
problem is solvable by discussion among reasonable men 
sweden which allocates 1 percent of its gross national product 
to foreign aid also has provided a pool of experienced diplomats 
for international service 
bernt carlsson was un commissioner for namibia he died in dec 
21 pan am plane crash in scotland while on his way to new york to 
observe the signing of an agreement for namibian independence from 
south african rule 
jan eliasson swedens un ambassador was tapped by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on sept 1 to lead 
iraniraq peace negotiations 
in less public roles swedish diplomats have been conduits for 
contacts between rival factions in nicaragua and el salvador among 
others schori said 
last year the swedes persuaded cuba to allow the red cross to 
visit prisoners in cuban jails 
swedens international activity goes back a long way prime 
minister karl branting won the 1921 nobel peace prize for his work 
with the league of nations 
it has contributed 55000 men to un peacekeeping forces which 
were created by the un secretarygeneral dag hammarskjold a swede 
count folke bernadotte a member of swedens royal family was 
the uns first martyr he was assassinated by jewish extremists in 
preindependence palestine in 1948 
four years earlier diplomat raoul wallenberg distributed swedish 
passports to hungarian jews threatened with deportation to nazi 
death camps he was credited with saving 100000 lives before soviet 
forces arrested him at the close of the war and he disappeared the 
soviets say he died in prison in 1947 but his family is convinced 
he is still alive 
gunnar jarring appointed special un emissary to the middle 
east after the 1967 sixday war earned a footnote in history as the 
inventor of shuttle diplomacy though the credit went later to 
former us secretary of state henry kissinger jarrings mission 
ended in failure 
schori said the relaxation of ussoviet tension may usher in a 
less active period for sweden 
theres been a need for bridgebuilding now its changing 
he said we have no ambition to be mediators where we have a 
contribution to make we do all we can but i see this role 
declining in an era of detente

federal regulators rescued a postdepression 
record 217 savings institutions in 1988 leaving congress and 
presidentelect bush to figure out the best way to pay the 38 
billion bill 
theoretically the federal home loan bank board which regulates 
the sampl industry expects enough income over the next 30 years 45 
billion to 50 billion to cover the cost 
but analysts and many members of congress say regulators have run 
up such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable 
we still dont know the magnitude of the sampl crisis senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas said sunday were not even 
certain what the regulators have been doing the past week running 
up a tab of some 40 billion 
even with a lastminute spending spree of nearly 6 billion to 
rescue 22 institutions in the final 48 hours of 1988 regulators 
still have about 350 more insolvency cases to handle and as of 
last sept 30 another 150 savings institutions were sliding toward 
insolvency with capital levels below 15 percent 
estimates of the total cost of paying for the mess run as high as 
112 billion a figure reported last month by the general accounting 
office congress auditing agency 
treasury department officials are considering a variety of plans 
for the incoming administration most attempt to spread out the 
burden over time and keep as much as possible from adding to the 
federal budget deficit 
but dole in an interview on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said somebodys going to have to pay we cant 
hide it by putting it off budget or smoke and mirrors 
this years failure and rescue total 217 of the 3100 sampls 
operating at the start of the year is more than quadruple last 
years total of 48 it is the highest total since a record 277 
failures and rescues in the depression year of 1938 
according to the federal deposit insurance corp which insures 
the nations 13500 commercial banks 221 banks failed or required 
government assistance that is also a postdepression record 
topping the previous record of 203 in 1987 
both the fdic and the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
draw their funds from an assessment on member institutions but the 
fdic depends on the muchlarger banking industry which as a whole 
is in much better shape and enters 1989 in relatively good shape 
with more than 15 billion in reserves 
fslic however is technically insolvent so regulators have 
been patching together rescue deals with as little cash as possible 
most of the aid takes the form of various commitments secured by 
revenue that regulators dont have now and in some case wont have 
for as long as 30 years 
moreover the revenue projections depend on charging sampls a 
special assessment originally intended to be phased out in a few 
years over the next three decades industry officials say that 
would drive even more sampls into the red 
the biggest rescue on the last day of 1988 was for the beverly 
hills savings and loan association a giant california institution 
whose financial problems had plagued regulators for years 
the package called for the government to provide 983 million in 
assistance in the sale of beverly hills to michigan national corp 
a bank holding company in farmington hills mich that is putting 
52 million into the deal 
also on saturday the bank board pledged 
2433 million in aid to home federal savings and loan a san 
diego sampl putting up 25 million to acquire three institutions in 
the san francisco area they are columbus savings and loan san 
rafael cal america savings and loan walnut creek and first 
security pleasant hill 
1511 million in aid to california savings and loan of los 
angeles which agreed to put up 204 million into the insolvent

the nations capital also may be the nations 
murder capital 
in 1988 371 people were killed in the district of columbia far 
surpassing the previous high of 287 set in 1969 police say drugs 
are mostly to blame 
final population and homicide figures have yet to be compared 
but washington and detroit had the two highest percapita murder 
rates in america in 1988 
thus the nations capital where the federal governments war on 
drugs is mapped out could earn the dubious distinction of being the 
murder capital as well 
the district of columbias drug problems dramatize the two 
different washingtons the capitol the white house and other sites 
visited by millions of tourists each year and the squalid 
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power 
there a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn 
to the status and money that come from selling drugs 
police say drugs particularly the arrival of crack cocaine 
are to blame for about 60 percent of the slayings as recently as 
1986 drugrelated killings accounted for just onethird of the 
citys homicide total 
the absence of organized crime in washington may be a factor in 
the citys murder rate officials say law enforcement officials say 
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug 
market there are fewer drugrelated slayings 
what you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting 
among themselves for drug turf said police chief maurice t 
turner they are just working for themselves 
stemming the citys drug tide has become an increasingly tough 
battle for turner and his 3800 officers 
earlier this year police decided they will switch to 9mm 
semiautomatic handguns out of fear that weapons commonly found on 
the street were outclassing the standard 38caliber sixshot 
revolver officers have been carrying 
the new weapons which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots 
before reloading were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted 
in the seizure of uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated 
weaponry surveying the weapons at a march news conference turner 
called the districts streets something out of the wild wild 
west officers will have their new guns by 1990 
and police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects 
hasnt dulled the citys appetite for narcotics a highlytouted 
antidrug program operation clean sweep has produced more than 
46000 arrests since it began in august 1986 
however turner has complained that the program which sends 
swarms of officers through druginfested neighborhoods to make 
arrests has done little more than further clog the citys already 
overcrowded jail and court systems 
for each drug dealer arrested another springs forward according 
to turner 
a lot of these kids are high school dropouts with few skills 
turner said they can make up to a 1 million a year selling 
drugs what would you do 
jay b stephens us attorney for the district of columbia who 
can prosecute both local and federal crimes announced in december 
that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work solely on 
drugrelated killings in the district 
turner also has called on city officials to spend more money on 
drug education prevention and treatment programs currently a 
threeweek wait is common for people wanting to enroll in the citys 
treatment centers 
as for the future police believe that as markets are more firmly 
established for crack a highlyaddictive cocaine derivative the 
murder rate will decrease 
this is one of the last major cities in this country to have an 
infusion of crack turner said when crack arrived in other 
cities like new york murder rates went up there too

ringing in the new year are dozens of changes 
in federal laws and regulations many of them aimed at quenching 
americans thirst for security and a few that will make life a 
little more expensive 
among the most significant of the jan 1 changes are a vast 
expansion of medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses faster 
pension fund vesting that will benefit millions particularly women 
and tax changes reducing the governments subsidizing of purchases 
on credit 
others that occurred just before the end of 1988 or are scheduled 
early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private 
employers 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large 
layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating 
against the handicapped and families with children 
a few of the changes are a little more esoteric but their impact 
eventually may be felt by the entire population 
for example environmental protection agency regulations 
implementing the 46nation ozone treaty took effect jan 1 the 
regulations dont require chemical companies to actually do anything 
until next july but then they must cut their production of 
chloroflourocarbon or cfc compounds by an estiamted 20 percent back 
to 1986 levels 
the treaty is aimed at halting the depletion of the ozone layer 
15 to 25 miles up protecting the earths surface from ultraviolet 
rays cfc compounds also contribute to the greenhouse effect 
that is warming the planet 
as a result of the regulations consumers may notice fewer 
plastic food containers from fastfood outlets thicker insulating 
panels and possibly even slightly harder seat cushions 
the biggest of the immediate changes is the jan 1 expansion of 
medicare coverage for 32 million medicare beneficiaries to include 
catastrophic health care costs 
prior to passage of the measure last summer by congress the 
first major expansion of medicare in its 22year history the 
program paid full hospital bills for no more than 59 days a year 
with the changes that took effect sunday the beneficiary still 
will have to pay the firstday deductible of 560 but that charge 
will be assessed no more than once a year no matter how many times 
the patient has to be hospitalized the other 364 days are fully 
paid 
that fundamental change in the hospital benefit was the 
cornerstone of the medicare expansion set in motion by president 
reagan in his 1986 state of the union message 
let us remove a financial specter facing our older ameicans 
the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to 
make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death he said 
then 
medicare enrollees will pay for the new benefits through a flat 
increase in the premium deducted from their monthly social security 
checks and an additional sliding scale premium for approximately 40 
percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax 
the flat increase will be 4 a month effective immediately 
climbing to 1020 monthly in 1993 the sliding scale premium is 
projected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax 
liability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993 
many of the jan 1 changes grow out of the 1986 tax reform act 
the biggest new benefit from that law is faster vesting in pension 
plans 
the maximum waiting period for employees to become fully invested 
in a pension is being cut in half from 10 years to five years 
however employers can adopt an option that denies full vesting 
until seven years to do so they have to offer 20 percent vesting 
after three years and an additional 20 percent vesting annually 
until the seventh year when it reaches 100 percent 
the employee benefit research institute estimates that the 
pension changes will provide a retirement stake to 2 million more 
workers a year 
well especially see more women being vested than in the past 
because they tend to be in the workforce or with the same employer 
for shorter periods said stephanie poe a spokeswoman for the 
institute 
another tax change is that only 20 percent of personal interest 
payments on everything from car and student loans to credit card 
charges will be deductible in 1989 compared with 40 percent last 
year 
and while the government is now raising tax brackets exemptions 
and standard deductions to keep costofliving raises from bumping 
people into higher brackets it also is taking more social security 
taxes 
the 751 percent social security tax took a maximum 3380 out of 
employee paychecks in 1988 this year the maximum amount of income 
subject to the tax rises from 45000 to 48000 raising the 
maximum social security tax that can be collected from an individual 
employee to 3605 
the latest change came about just last thursday when the federal 
aviation administration ordered airlines effective jan 1 to 
either inspect by hand or xray all luggage checked aboard us 
airline flights from western europe and the middle east 
the new inspections prompted by the bombing of a pan am jet over 
scotland on dec 21 are expected to delay passenger checkins by 
about an hour 
other changes taking effect slightly before or after new years 
day include 
the use of polygraph or lie detector tests by private employers 
to screen job applicants was outlawed with some exceptions 
effective last tuesday the american civil liberties union estimates 
the law will effectively eliminate about 80 percent of the 2 million 
polygraph exams now administered annually 
a 47yearold ban on homework in five apparel trades is being 
removed on jan 8 unless unions which support the prohibitions win 
a court stay first affected are an estimated 50000 to 75000 
workers in fields such as mittens and gloves embroideries buttons 
and buckles handkerchiefs and some jewelry trades they will be 
able to work legally at home for the first time if their employers 
obtain a certficate from the labor department after pledging to 
abide by minimum wage and other federal labor standards 
a law requiring employers to provide 60 days advance notice of 
plant closings or layoffs affecting 50 or more people officially 
takes effect feb 4 however there are different interpretations on 
whether companies are required to have provided 60 days notice 
beforehand if they close a plant on that date the labor department 
advised in early december that to avoid potential liability they 
should 
regulations implementing a law passed by congress last summer 
forbidding landlords from discriminating against the handicapped or 
families with children take effect march 12 violators can be fined 
up to 10000 for a first offense 25000 for a second violation in 
a fiveyear period and 50000 for two or more violations within a 
sevenyear period

the christmas day eruption of the 
snowcapped lonquimay volcano in southern chile is gaining in force 
and seismologists say they expect it to continue for at least 
another two months 
authorities have issued masks to residents who are remaining in 
the area to protect them from a thick cloud of ash spewed by the 
volcano over a sparsely populated area of about 12 square miles 
and scientists estimate that 525 million cubic feet of lava have 
oozed out of the 8400foot volcano toward an uninhabited valley 
since the eruption began 
lonquimay a peak in the andes foothills about 400 miles south of 
santiago had been dormant for a century when it erupted on 
christmas day 
authorities say the eruption poses no danger for two nearby 
villages lolco and malacahuello residents of both towns quickly 
evacuated after the eruption and some later returned home but many 
remain lodged at schools and municipal buildings in curacautin a 
city 50 miles away 
authorities on saturday issued masks to the few residents who had 
returned to their homes researchers soldiers and police officers 
also in the area were also wearing the white masks 
on sunday the volcano continued to spew smoke and lava through a 
300footwide crater the volcano initially showed three separate 
smaller fissures but a series of explosions joined them into a 
single crater authorities said 
seismologists from the university of la frontera in temuco the 
largest city in the region said a 1200footwide 30foothigh 
mass of lava is slowly slipping down the volcano 
they said the route followed by the lava is the same as the one 
in the lonquimays previous eruption in 1889 and poses no danger 
for the population livestock in the area were removed to safer 
zones police said

outgoing labor secretary ann mclaughlin says 
her successor needs to carve out a place on presidentelect bushs 
team of top economic advisers to help solve the nations 
competitiveness problem 
mrs mclaughlin the only woman in the reagan cabinet said in an 
interview with the associated press on occasion ive felt that we 
were spending too much time looking backward instead of preparing a 
human resource policy for the future 
bush recently named former transportation secretary elizabeth 
dole as the next labor secretary and so far the only woman in 
his cabinet 
but he did not give her what mrs mclaughlin thinks the labor 
secretary needs a designated spot on his top economic team right 
alongside the heads of the treasury and commerce departments and the 
white house budget office and council of economic advisers 
mrs mclaughlin during her 14month cabinet stint sought to 
heighten business awareness of employee needs such as job 
retraining flexible hours and childcare assistance and emphasized 
the links between education and competitiveness 
i see the labor department as an economic arm she said i 
think bush is headed there the question is how do we get to the 
next step 
the name of the game is going to be competitiveness and unless 
the incoming labor secretary moves in there and ties the human 
resource issues with the equation were going to have a skills 
shortage she said 
mrs mclaughlin in what she calls her holistic approach to 
workplace issues has often complained that too many people in 
government labor and business are looking backward and constantly 
fighting over turf 
during her brief tenure mrs mclaughlin spent a good part of her 
time in those skirmishes fighting her way into them on occasion and 
sometimes finding herself on the sidelines 
it was on her watch that the aflcio won its first major 
legislative victories in a decade a ban on the use of polygraphs or 
lie detectors by private employers to screen job applicants and 
mandatory advance notices of plant closings and large layoffs once 
vetoed by reagan 
with sens orrin hatch rutah and edward m kennedy dmass 
forming an uncharacteristic but also unstoppable alliance on the 
first mrs mclaughlin helped persuade the white house to acquiesce 
to the polygraph ban rather than continue opposing it on behalf of 
some business groups 
she was relegated to the sidelines on the second with 
thentreasury secretary james a baker iii using the plant closing 
notices as the primary reason for reagan to veto legislation 
overhauling the nations trade laws 
when republican moderates from northern and midwestern states 
with large bluecollar constituencies wanted to cut a deal last 
spring in which labor would get advance notices of plant closings 
but not other layoffs baker said no 
four months later with polls showing that more than 80 percent 
of voters favored advance layoff warnings baker then bushs 
campaign chief persuaded reagan to let the notices for both layoffs 
and plant closings become law without his signature 
plant closing was bigger than all of us mrs mclaughlin 
said there was never a time when the plant closing situation was 
really thought through if im remiss i suppose i should have 
hollered louder 
as the former no 2 official in the interior department mrs 
mclaughlin relished playing the broker mediating disputes between 
environmentalists and oil companies and cutting deals on alaskan and 
offshore drilling 
she tried the same approach at labor finding that while union 
leaders and business executives spoke glowingly of cooperation they 
were often unyielding in practice 
organized labor is not there yet in its role of what it can do 
for itself and this country with regard to training a quality work 
force and all the issues of the workplace as we move into the 21st 
century she said and they wont be there in my view if they 
continue just to back mandated legislation piecemeal to address 
workers needs 
on the other hand business isnt there yet either it will 
hold the line on legislation just like labor will push it instead 
of finding out whats driving these things she said 
mrs mclaughlin said she will keep speaking out on child care 
flextime education drugs the human resource issues that she says 
will determine the nations economic health in the 1990s 
she claimed she is not surprised not to have a role in the new 
administration although she had declared her availability early 
i expected george bush to find his team his people she 
said its time to leave because i leave on a high i join a 
prestigious group of people who were here only a year or two years

chief justice william h rehnquist has strongly 
endorsed a proposal to raise federal judges salaries by 51 percent 
to 135000 a year 
in his 1988 yearend report on the federal judiciary rehnquist 
threw his weight behind a presidential commissions recommendation 
of big pay raises for judges and about 2000 other top federal 
officials 
besides calling for the pay raise for trial judges who now make 
89500 the commission recommended boosting salaries of federal 
appeals court judges from 95000 to 140000 a 47 percent jump of 
supreme court associate justices from 110000 to 165000 a 50 
percent increase and of the chief justice from 115000 to 
175000 a 52 percent increase 
the recommendations are pending before president reagan who can 
accept or modify the figures before sending his fiscal 1990 budget 
to congress on jan 9 
under the law whatever pay increases the president endorses will 
take effect 30 days later unless both the house and the senate vote 
to set them aside 
over the past two decades the purchasing power of federal 
judicial salaries has been seriously eroded by inflation 
rehnquist said 
the buying power of an appeals court judges salary has dropped 
30 percent in the past 20 years said the chief justice adding 
while the salary of the median household has increased 
approximately 200 percent to keep pace with inflation since 1969 
the salaries of federal trial judges rose by little more than half 
that amount 
rehnquist cited a recent american bar foundation survey in which 
30 percent of the federal judges who responded said they planned to 
resign before retirement unless a significant increase in 
compensation is provided 
dozens of federal judges have resigned from the bench during 
the past 15 years far more than ever before due in large part to 
financial reasons rehnquist said and the problem appears to be 
growing worse 
he said judicial salaries are directly linked to the quality of 
american justice 
comparing justice and medical care rehnquist said we are 
interested in receiving the best medical care available if the 
quality of medical treatment is poor it is little consolation that 
the cost may be low 
he added the right to ones day in court is meaningless if the 
judge who hears the case lacks the talent experience and 
temperament that will enable him to protect imperiled rights and to

deep in the basement of a suburban family home 
220 ferrets from all around the country frolic with toy balls crawl 
tubes and other ferretphernalia in a makeshift halfway house for 
the weasellike creatures 
the ferrets unwanted by their owners or between homes are the 
pride and joy of mary van dahm who keeps 14 of her own upstairs 
it started 18 months ago when a group of concerned chicagoarea 
ferretlovers formed the greater chicago ferret association mrs 
van dahm the only founding officer with a basement was asked to 
run the associations shelter 
she agreed 
so when a chicago woman recently asked her veterinarian what to 
do with two ferrets her older son had outgrown she was told to head 
for the van dahm home 
there the ferrets live in cages until a new owner is found 
weve gotten ferrets from all over the country said mrs van 
dahm who prefers to keep the location of her home a secret so as 
not to disturb the neighbors 
some were transported from new jersey a batch from kentucky 
arrived after animalwelfare officials seized 19 ferrets from a 
louisvillearea woman who kept them in a cramped backyard shed 
others come from disenchanted owners 
it was not what i expected one woman said complaining that 
her ferret did not like to sit in her lap to be stroked like a cat 
they are more exotic than dogs or cats mrs van dahm said 
they are good for apartment dwellers because they are small and 
can be kept in cages most of the time 
they also have a bit of a wild look and they dont provoke 
allergies she said 
of the nations estimated 5 million pet ferrets about 10000 
live in the chicago area said janice miller president of the 
greater chicago ferret association based in suburban westchester 
she said the association was formed because so much was 
unknown about ferrets 
we wanted to say hey these little guys arent so bad 
ferret lovers say the animals reputation as a sometimes vicious 
biter is unfounded 
they are often mistakenly considered rodents but related to 
weasels and mink like cats they can be trained to use litter boxes 
and will eat cat food 
they have a strong will to survive said susan brown a 
westchester veterinarian and another association member they are 
easy to work with im seldom bitten in fact im bitten far more 
often by iguanas and birds

not long ago parliament was a mere 
rubberstamp body that met for just four threeday sessions a year 
now outspoken deputies are openly demanding accountability from 
communist authorities 
live television coverage came to parliament in september and its 
383 deputies have since begun edging the oncetame forum toward 
democracy 
increasingly deputies are bringing into the open formerly taboo 
subjects such as defense spending they challenge government and 
communist party leaders to adhere to their avowed policy of openness 
and disclose facts and figures 
the changes more rapid than political reforms occuring in 
mikhail s gorbachevs soviet union have prompted rare admissions 
from hungarys communist leadership about how parliamentary work was 
controlled in the past 
matyas szueroes head of the partys parliamentary group was 
quoted by the government daily magyar hirlap as admitting that 
communist leaders once met with deputies to tell them how to vote 
on live radio and television constituents watch closely what one 
budapest man termed the great theater emanating from 
parliaments 19th century quarters on the danube and are 
exercising their own rights as a result 
deputy karoly eke says he has received a tremendous response 
from constituents since the broadcasts began just two days into 
decembers session he had already received eight letters commenting 
on his behavior in debates 
deputies now meet often and debate into the night in december 
parliament held the years unprecedented fifth session the third in 
as many months the agenda was so long that speaker istvan stadinger 
announced an unprecedented christmas recess with business to resume 
jan 10 
mindful of novembers exhausting session when deputies worked 12 
hours a day to get through the agenda he also limited the length of 
daily sessions in the high gilded chamber 
the noncommunists who make up 25 percent of the deputies then 
took another unprecedented step banding together in a formal group 
intended as a counterweight to the longestablished group of 
communist parliamentarians 
judit benjamin coordinator for the new group told magyar hirlap 
it aims to obtain the same information as communist deputies 
the noncommunists include one of the most outspoken deputies 
zoltan kiraly a television journalist from southern hungary who was 
expelled from the communist party earlier this year for his views 
in october kiraly stunned the chamber when he and other deputies 
requested a change in voting procedures on a controversial dam and 
power plant project opposed by many hungarians as damaging to the 
environment 
his request for a roll call vote sparked an acrimonious 
spontaneous debate that was eventually settled by compromise 
taking government and party leaders at their word that this 
soviet bloc countrys parliament should be more independent kiraly 
and other deputies have also called for new elections prior to those 
planned for 1990 
the reformers say the current legislature with 75 percent 
communist deputies is incapable of making independent decisions 
in some ways the changes in parliament mirror events in the 
society at large 
within weeks this fall hungary went from debating whether a 
multiparty system was feasible to discussing how soon it would come 
about 
the communist leadership the countrys ruling force has 
appealed for patience saying the package of political reforms it 
outlined in november will take 18 to 24 months to introduce 
deputy justice minister geza kilenyi has said a new constitution 
and a law on establishing political parties will be adopted before 
the 1990 elections 
noncommunist candidates were allowed to contest and win seats in 
the last elections in 1985 
but debates that seemed fiery and controversial then now seem 
dull 
in december for example budapest transport official andras 
derzsi won only a simple majority when elected to head a new 
superministry for construction transport and communications 
just 25 deputies voted against derzsi the only candidate put 
forward by communist premier miklos nemeth but 128 abstained in a 
vote that was forced into a recount after one deputy complained the 
115 tally for absentions was inaccurate 
on the dam project vote in october szueroes admitted the 
communist leadership gave a firm orientation to party deputies 
not to support a referendum or the organization of international 
supervision 
but he added swiftly in a december interview this belongs to 
the past

like prizefighters entering the ring 
republican president bush and the democratic congress will return to 
the political arena this month after two months of preparation 
with lots of smiles and a handshake 
and as in any championship highstakes fight it will be only a 
matter of time before someone ends up with a bloodied nose the 
tough veteran democrats who have controlled congress for years or 
the republican administration which showed in last falls campaign 
that when the going got tough it did too 
the senates new democratic majority leader george mitchell of 
maine already has asked the presidentelect to approach congress 
with candor consultation and trust george bush who promised a 
kinder and gentler nation in his successful campaign has 
indicated he wants a closer relationship with congress than that 
enjoyed by his predecessor ronald reagan 
round one wont begin until after bush is inaugurated on the west 
front of the capitol on jan 20 and congress returns the following 
monday jan 23 
then however brief will come that washington institution the 
political honeymoon 
but unlike other washington institutions the honeymoon probably 
wont last long 
democrats firmly in control of both the house and senate are 
anxiously awaiting the new presidents budget recommendations 
starting with his ideas on how to save 32 billion to meet 
deficitreduction targets then in may bush will have to ask 
congress to raise the national debt ceiling above its current 28 
trillion figure 
democrats also will have their own agenda to push perhaps a 
renewed drive for a hike in the minimum wage and other costly plans 
to compete for tight budget dollars 
and all these problems and programs come wrapped in bushs 
promise not to raise taxes 
the deficit is a time bomb with a lighted fuse sen j 
bennett johnston dla said in a recent interview bushs 
tendered solution his flexible freeze is deja voodoo all over 
again the idea that we can grow our way out of this mess is 
absolute nonsense 
the question is how can a republican president elected by a 
solid majority deal with a democratic senate and house also 
elected by a solid majority 
history it seems is against the president 
presidential success is mainly a function of the number of 
seats in congress held by the presidents party say writers 
norman j ornstein of the american enterprise institute thomas e 
mann of the brookings institution and michael j malbin of the house 
republican conference in their book vital statistics on 
congress 
using figures compiled by congressional quarterly the 
congressional observers uncovered some stark statistics 
when one party controls both branches success never drops 
below 75 percent they said with divided government presidents 
average well below that level of success 
for example when lyndon johnson swept into office in 1964 his 
agenda measured by public positions was near 88 percent successful 
in the congress republican gerald ford however managed only a 
582 percent victory rate in first full year in office 
when jimmy carter marched into the white house in 1976 with his 
party in control of both houses of congress he enjoyed initially 
a 75 percent success rate in pushing his legislation 
but that shouldnt be the case in 1989 with bush vowing no new 
taxes and democrats almost daring him to run the country without 
them 
it isnt a question of economics its a question of 
mathematics says house speaker jim wright of texas 
i want to give him the benefit of the doubt surely he must 
have a plan wright says 
across the capitol senate leader mitchell also is offering to 
reason with bush 
the larger objective is to provide to our people the greatest 
possible individual liberty and economic opportunity mitchell 
said our system divided or not can do that but it can do it 
only if there is a shared understanding of the need for candor 
consultation and trust 
divided government cannot work in a polarized society one in 
which mistrust and deceit are widespread mitchell added

twentyseven people were arrested during a 
demonstration to protest the pilgrim nuclear plants restart nearly 
three years after it was closed for management and maintenance 
problems 
those arrested who were among more than 125 demonstrators were 
charged with trespassing and released authorities said 
it was a symbolic show of our frustration of our determination 
not to go away said donald muirhead a member of citizens for

morning and positioned themselves at the entrance to one of the 
plants two main gates 
one protester priscilla dean hatton of west yarmouth said she 
is a 12thgeneration descendant of a pilgrim born on the mayflower 
why are they still making these wasteful products with no place 
to dump them she asked during the hourlong protest 
on friday the federal nuclear regulatory commission cleared the 
way for lowpower testing of the 670megawatt reactor for up to 5 
percent of its capacity 
if the plants restart schedule is followed pilgrim will provide 
customers power when it hits 10 percent of capacity sometime next 
month it will reach full power in four months 
pilgrim had been shut since april 1986 when the nrc called the 
reactor one of the worstrun nuclear plants in the country 
boston edison has spent about 200 million since the shutdown to 
replace nearly all of the plants top management fix mechanical 
problems and fight skepticism by the nrc and a growing antinuclear 
movement among residents 
but the state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the 
plant from operating state officials including gov michael s 
dukakis have said evacuation plans for those living near the plant 
are inadequate despite utility company revisions they also have 
said the plant should not reopen until a new study of leukemia rates 
of nearby residents is complete

prime minister margaret thatcher said all nations 
must cooperate to track down whoever sabotaged pan am flight 103 but 
made clear she opposes an eye for an eye revenge attack that 
could harm innocent people 
in washington fbi director william sessions welcomed plo 
chairman yasser arafats reported offer to help in identifying any 
suspects however he said he still had no evidence linking a 
terrorist group to the plastic explosives bomb that downed the new 
yorkbound boeing 747 
mrs thatcher distanced herself sunday from us vows to punish 
the culprits saying i dont think an eye for an eye and tooth for 
a tooth is ever valid 
the dec 21 explosion and crash at lockerbie scotland killed all 
259 people on board another 11 people on the ground are missing and 
presumed dead 
the most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation 
of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought 
to justice mrs thatcher said in a television interview with 
journalist david frost 
revenge is never a good word to use because it can affect 
innocent people she added 
the sunday express a london newspaper reported without 
attribution that arafat has vowed to dispatch an assassination squad 
to hunt down and kill whoever is responsible 
the paper said the palestine liberation organization also sent a 
message to president reagan pledging a traitors death for the 
bomber if its operatives find him first 
us officials say no group has offered a credible claim of 
responsibility for the attack speculation on suspects has focused 
mostly on palestinian extremists opposed to arafats middle east 
peace initiative 
reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast saturday that a report 
overseen by presidentelect bush advocating possible military action 
against terrorists ought to be giving some people sleepless 
nights in the wake of the bombing he did not elaborate 
bush vowed last week to seek hard and punish firmly 
decisively those who did this if you could ever find them 
sessions interviewed sunday on abcs this week with david 
brinkley and nbcs meet the press said arafat has a wealth 
of information he can give us but said he opposes any attempt by 
the plo leader to retaliate by killing any suspects 
we believe in the system of justice the fbi director said 
we hope those people are handled in the courts 
he added that contacts between the fbi and arafat presumably 
could be set up by the state department us and plo officials 
opened a dialogue dec 17 after arafat renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist 
sessions said he anticipated a lengthy investigation into the 
crash 
mrs thatcher allowed reagan to use us bombers based in britain 
to bomb libya on april 15 1986 in retaliation for alleged libyan 
sponsorship of international terrorism at least 100 people were 
killed in the raid 
she said sunday that no country should grant the pan am bombers 
safe haven or permit them to escape justice 
i think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not 
try to track down terrorists absolutely disgusted she said 
searchers in lockerbie gave up their traditional new years 
celebrations sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and wreckage 
police said that one more body thought to be one of the missing 
local residents was recovered bringing the total found to 242 
british newspapers reported saturday that investigators believe 
the bomb was smuggled onto the flight in frankfurt possibly by a 
lebaneseborn passenger duped into carrying it the west german 
government said no evidence supports those reports 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 and switched 
to a boeing 747 at londons heathrow airport for the trip to new 
york

a palestinian held by greece and wanted by 
the united states for the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner may hold 
clues to the group that blew up flight 103 over scotland last month 
whether he will ever tell his story in a us court is an open 
question 
greeces supreme court has twice delayed the extradition of 
mohammed rashid 39 who is thought by western intelligence experts 
to specialize in the planting of bombs aboard jetliners and to be a 
senior operative in the may 15 palestinian terrorist group 
the rashid case has taken on extra significance since the dec 21 
bombing of pan am flight 103 which killed all 259 people aboard the 
boeing 747 and about a dozen on the ground 
us and european officials are focusing on the may 15 group and 
another extremist group the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command as possible suspects in the bombing 
on nov 15 the greek supreme court indefinitely postponed its 
decision on extraditing rashid saying the united states had failed 
to supply key documents in the case the us embassy in athens says 
the requested documents have been turned over to the greek 
government 
the requested papers have been sent i guess they are being 
moved from ministry to ministry said an embassy representative 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
rashid is wanted in the united states on charges of planting a 
bomb that exploded on a pan am jet as it flew from tokyo to hawaii 
six years ago a japanese teenager was killed and 15 people were 
hurt 
rashid was arrested at athens airport on may 29 on a tip from 
us officials and was sentenced to seven months in jail for 
entering greece with a false passport 
american officials have claimed rashid and the may 15 
organization which is named for the date the 1948 arabisraeli war 
began also involved in the 1986 bombing of a twa jetliner over 
southern greece that killed four americans that blast is not 
mentioned in the extradition request 
the supreme court has not said when it will issue its decision 
an extradition ruling has to be approved by justice minister 
vassilis rotis before it can be carried out 
the long delays in rashids case combined with the rejection of 
an italian plea for extradition of another palestinian have given 
rise to charges that greeces governing panhellenic socialist 
movement is not committed to combating international terrorism 
in early december the government reneged on an extradition 
agreement with italy and put 27yearold abdel osama zomar on a 
plane to benghazi libya zomar was suspected of helping to organize 
a september 1982 attack on romes main synagogue that killed a 
2yearold boy and left 37 people injured 
the palestinian had been imprisoned in greece since november 
1982 when he was arrested at the greekturkish border driving a car 
loaded with explosives 
justice minister rotis said he overturned a 1984 supreme court 
extradition decision because zomar was acting in the struggle for 
the reacquisition of his homeland 
zomar had been identified as one of two arabs jailed in greece 
with links to the extremist palestinian faction fatahrevolutionary 
council which is headed by terrorist mastermind abu nidal 
the other is omar mabrouki serving a 10year jail term for 
trying to shoot the jordanian charge daffairs in athens in 1984 
according to greek and western intelligence officials zomars 
detention may have triggered an attack on the city of poros cruise 
ship last july near athens nine people were killed and 11 others 
were injured in the assault 
there have been no arrests in connection with the ship attack 
but one of the four men apparently involved in the machinegun and 
grenade assault has been identified by greek police as mohammed 
khadar 40 the alleged operations officer for the abu nidal group 
in the past greece has been criticized by its western allies for 
failing to crack down on suspected palestinian terrorists operating 
out of the country 
last year the government was accused of allowing the abu nidal 
group to operate a logistics office in athens in return for a 
promise by the group that it would not launch attacks in greece the 
office was shut down in july 1987 after strong protests from 
greeces allies 
greece has repeatedly denied it is soft on terrorism 
the government condemns all forms of terrorism and takes all 
measures it deems necessary to fight it government spokesman 
sotiris kostopoulos said recently

president fidel castro celebrating the 30th 
anniversary of his revolution rejected marketoriented economic 
reforms and said that for cuba it is socialism or death 
castros remarks in a televised speech sunday night seemed 
aimed at the soviet union and other communist countries that have 
been abandoning strict adherence to marxist doctrine 
today we say with more force than ever socialism or death 
marxism leninism or death he said 
castro spoke to a large gathering from the balcony of the 
municipal building in the eastern city of santiago where he had 
proclaimed victory for his revolutionary struggle on jan 1 1959 
he did not refer directly to the soviet union in his remarks 
saying only that the contemporary situation has been marked by 
confusion 
in other speeches castro has been more explicit about his 
rejection of the reform policies of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
he has said that cuba will never embrace any reforms that reek 
of capitalism he also has acknowledged that the changes under 
gorbachev could cause difficulties for cuba 
the cubansoviet friendship although far from breaking up seems 
more tenuous now than it has been in decades 
a key question is whether soviet unhappiness with the way cuba 
has used economic aid from the kremlin estimated at 5 billion 
annually will lead to cutbacks castro has used the economic aid 
to help build his countrys schools and hospitals the soviets say 
and has neglected industrial development 
calling the revolution a beacon of light before the eyes of the 
world castro said cuba has an enormous responsibility to third 
world countries to stick to its present hardline marxistleninist 
course 
much of castros speech was devoted to reviewing the 
revolutionary heritage of the people of santiago and other cities in 
eastern cuba 
cuba officials said castro is expected to deliver a policy 
address on wednesday 
despite sundays call for ideological steadfastness cuban policy 
has undergone some drastic changes in the past year including its 
recent commitment to withdraw its 50000 troops from angola by 1991 
in latin america castro has been aggressively pursuing interests 
common to other countries in the area the evolution of democracy in 
latin america which has been welcomed by the reagan administration 
has also had the ironic side effect of opening diplomatic 
opportunities for castro 
the cuban leader once known for his efforts to promote violent 
revolution now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with 
elected governments 
castro attended presidential inagurations in ecuador and mexico 
in recent months and may participate in the inauguration of the 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela next month 
during castros visit to mexico in late november his first since 
he was exiled there in the 1950s he said he envisions the eventual 
unity of cuba and the rest of latin america 
one day we will make one big giant he said

the judge who presided over ptls 
bankruptcy proceedings said he received threats during the case and 
couldnt understand why jim bakkers followers were interested in 
that little sawedoff runt 
rufus reynolds who retired saturday at age 81 as a us 
bankruptcy judge was guarded by us marshals during the bankruptcy 
proceedings as the fbi investigated the threats 
they didnt say im going to kill you they said the 
lords going to take you reynolds said 
i didnt know christians could be so critical they would just 
chew me out 
when a woman called the bankruptcy court in columbia sc to 
find out if he was a christian i said you tell her i was when i 
started this case but now i plead the fifth amendment 
reynolds said television ministries are wide open for 
mismanagement or corruption 
i think congress should pass a very strong act forcing the irs 
to make them comply with an accounting reynolds said we 
have all kinds of laws protecting consumers religion is just 
another consumer item just the same as selling soap or washing 
powders or aspirin 
reynolds also said he was amazed at the response to the travails 
that brought down bakkers evangelistic empire 
what puzzled me was why people were interested in that little 
sawedoff runt reynolds said 
bakker who resigned from ptl in 1987 responded sunday saying 
i am shocked to find judge reynolds so prejudiced toward us and 
to hear of him making fun of us and the ptl partners 
he should not have tried the ptl case with these feelings 
against us 
the ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws 
in june 1987 three months after bakker resigned from ptl 
two months ago reynolds ordered bakker his wife tammy and 
former aide david taggart to repay ptl nearly 77 million in 
benefits he found to be excessive last month he approved the sale 
of ptl assets to a canadian businessman 
also last month a federal grand jury indicted bakker and former 
top aide richard dortch on charges including fraud and conspiracy 
accusing them of diverting more than 4 million in ptl money for 
their own benefit two other former ptl officials were indicted 
upon his retirement reynolds sand he left the ptl case 
discouraged and somewhat cynical 
from the beginning reynolds said he believed the only way to 
save ptl was to keep it intact as a religious operation 
its a onepurpose center a religious center a wonderful 
idea reynolds said if bakker had employed reasonable business 
principles just on an average they wouldnt owe a dime 
reynolds said he was disappointed at the outcome of the case 
when youve had 40000 cases at least when youve had 
success in lots of them the majority of them when you take the one 
most publicized best known and you make a failure you cant feel 
very good its that simple reynolds said 
im going to take a bath and forget about it reynolds said 
someone asked me what was the best part of the whole case i said 
getting out

residents of two states today cleaned up 
homes damaged by a 12foot wall of water that surged down the virgin 
river after an dike broke forcing 1500 people to evacuate and 
closing interstate 15 
the 2000foot earthen dike 15 miles east of here gave way early 
sunday flooding 50 to 60 homes and 100 apartment units in southwest 
utah and three homes in littlefield ariz authorities said no 
injuries were reported 
the dam which was less than 4 years old had a history of 
seepage authorities said 
when civil defense sirens signaled the evacuation shortly after 
midnight saturday some of the 1500 people in the floods path 
mistakenly thought they heralded the new year officials said 
sherri hansen of bloomington and her husband had 20 minutes to 
evacuate before the water hit they sat on a hill watching through 
binoculars 
we sat there hoping and praying the river wouldnt get us 
she said the river didnt hit everyone i dont know how it chose 
us but we really got nailed 
the water surged into the hansens home filling the basement to 
the ceiling and doing structural damage estimated at 40000 
in littlefield lester c taylor 27 his wife and five children 
rescued many of their belongings before their adobe home was 
submerged in 5 feet of water 
the bad part was making sure my wife and the kids were ok 
taylor said i was scared 
utah gov norm bangerter flew to the region 300 miles south of 
salt lake city declared washington county a disaster area in an 
attempt to gain state and federal aid 
at a news conference bangerter said the dike built for 235 
million in 1983 would be rebuilt he said engineers would try to 
determine the cause of the 300footwide breach that opened 
the dike had helped contain quail creek reservoir in all 25000 
acre feet of water rushed through the breach and down the virgin 
river but the surge was shortlived by midday it had slowed to a 
trickle and power had been restored interstate 15 closed for 14 
hours was reopened after several bridges spanning the river were 
declared safe two bridges in the st george area were washed out 
closing part of utah 9 
seepage at the dike dated to 1985 the year the reservoir was 
filled said ronald thompson chairman of the washington county 
water conservancy district 
even before construction state geologists had warned that the 
presence of gypsum salt in the bedrock beneath the dike could cause 
problems gypsum dissolves if exposed to water for prolonged periods 
previous leaks were repaired with little difficulty thompson 
said 
new seepage was discovered saturday morning and by evening what 
had been small water loss had expanded to a major leak said 
thompson heavy equipment was dispatched to reinforce the dike but 
by 1030 pm it became apparent nothing could be done to prevent a 
breach and the machinery was pulled out

his parents 
though the boy was wearing several pairs of socks thermal 
underwear a flannel shirt and army field jacket nighttime 
temperatures dipped into the 20s for several days while he was

frostbitten feet and toes when he arrived at the hospital by

the pentagon will present the bush administration 
with a proposal to test a giant laser weapon modified so that it can 
destroy enemy satellites according to a published report 
the proposal could spark controversy because some members of 
congress and others oppose the development of antisatellite 
technology on the grounds that it could escalate the arms race 
the laser named miracl was designed to shoot down enemy 
missiles and has been tested successfully at the white sands missile 
range in new mexico but now the air force is preparing to engage in 
antisatellite tests which could occur as early as this year the 
new york times reported sunday 
a duty officer at the pentagon said sunday there would be no 
immediate comment on the report 
to conduct the tests the device must be modified so its beams 
are steady enough to be focused on objects hundreds of miles away 
experts say the modification will be relatively easy but the laser 
will have to be tested before anyone knows whether it can actually 
destroy satellites it will be tested on old us satellites the 
paper said 
the decision to upgrade the laser was made early last month by 
defense secretary frank carlucci and was reported in the dec 19 
issue of aviation week and space technology 
however the military must receive white house approval before 
the device is tested on satellites presidentelect bush has given 
no indication of his position on the issue 
gen john piotrowski commander in chief of the united states 
space command has said that the soviet union has lasers capable of 
destroying american satellites and that the united states lack of 
such equipment is a grave detriment to our national security 
paul stares a research associate at the brookings institution 
countered that the planned laser could undermine the general 
improvement in us and soviet relations as well as progress in 
arms control

a family of nine squeezes into an 
apartment the size of a small studio dozens of farmworkers share a 
single house others live in their cars or worse in bushes 
housing conditions in 1988 for farmworkers in the salinas and 
pajaro valleys about 120 miles south of san francisco were the worst 
in decades according to monterey county officials 
i would say this is probably the worst ive seen in farmworker 
housing in monterey county from the standpoint of ignoring the 
health and welfare of the farmworker said walter wong monterey 
county director of environmental health 
theyre putting them in such extreme conditions such as 
sleeping on top of pesticide sacks sleeping in caves sleeping in 
the bushes cooking in dirt in the ground with no water no 
toilets he said 
wongs agency is charged with licensing farm labor camps and 
enforcing health codes in 1988 he set a record by shutting down 
five illegal camps yet he concedes that for every camp he raided 
many others went unreported 
the fact is theres just going to be more of these extreme 
substandard housing conditions unless there is more housing 
developed for the farmworker he said adding that landlords and 
labor contractors are scooping up 100 percent profits under current 
conditions 
conditions are as primitive as any the harvest gypsies of the 
depression era endured wong said 
inspectors found workers and their families living in garages 
that were divided only with fabric partitions workers at one camp 
used a discarded bathtub for bathing building a fire beneath it to 
warm the water 
monterey county supervisor sam karas toured some of the camps 
last summer and discovered workers living in outhouses 
its really a disgrace said crescencio padilla a former 
farmworker and longtime community activist i saw the same 
situation 20 years ago and its worse than it was then were going 
backward 
just over a decade ago the salinas valley enjoyed a reputation 
for good working and living conditions following a successful 
organizing drive by the united farm workers union many growers 
provided camps for workers 
but conditions have changed since then and observers cite 
several pressures that have combined to create the farmworker 
housing crisis 
the federal amnesty program for illegal aliens attracted a 
larger stream of workers and family members to an area where housing 
costs are twice the national average at least two workers competed 
for every job last summer 
rents can quickly eat up a workers monthly earnings a 
twobedroom house in salinas rents for about 800 a month while the 
minimum wage for farmworkers is 5 an hour and most workers take 
home only about 200 to 250 a week 
more families are choosing to live here yearround filing for 
unemployment benefits and hoping to find piecework during the 
offseason 
the number of licensed labor camps in the county has fallen 
from more than 200 during the 1970s to 48 as growers and the 
government have gotten out of the housing business 
growers are relying more on independent contractors for their 
labor supply the number of contractors in the county has more than 
tripled in the last three years according to some estimates and 
workers are told a labor contractors responsibility is to find 
jobs not housing

an official armenian newspaper has printed a letter 
purported to be from armenian nationalists who threaten to wage 
terrorist attacks with usmade stinger missiles if their leaders 
are not freed from jail 
rafael popoyan an armenian activist called the letter a total 
fabrication from beginning to end he said it was another attempt 
by soviet officials to discredit people agitating for annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian enclave of neighboring 
azerbaijan 
published by the local communist party daily kommunist the 
letter demands the immediate release of members of the karabakh 
committee a banned group that has led an 11month campaign for the 
annexation of the enclave 
if the committees leaders are not freed the unsigned document 
says we will have recourse to mass terror in our arsenals we 
have stingers provided by our friends 
a facsimile copy of the purported document was published in 
kommunists wednesday editions which reached moscow over the 
weekend kommunist said the letter was received by law enforcement 
officials and labeled to be transmitted to the kgb 
the letter made no additional reference to the stingers many of 
the usmade groundtoair missiles have been shipped by the united 
states to insurgents fighting the soviets in afghanistan 
popoyan said the letter may herald a further crackdown by soviet 
authorities on the karabakh committee seven of whose members are 
now in jail the other four reportedly are in hiding to avoid arrest 
now that so many members of the committee have been arrested 
there is no one to answer these ridiculous charges popoyan said 
speaking by telephone from yerevan the armenian capital the 
press is now closed to anyone from the committee 
soviet authorities jailed karabakh committee leaders after the 
dec 7 earthquake in northwest armenia which killed 25000 people 
authorities have accused committee members of sabotaging the 
earthquake relief effort and whipping up ethnic tensions by 
continuing to seek karabakhs annexation by armenia a demand the 
kremlin has refused 
since february at least 60 people have been killed in ethnic 
rioting in mainly christian armenian and mainly moslem azerbaijan

in an apparent effort to help remedy severe 
consumer shortages the soviet union announced it would ban the 
export of goods ranging from caviar to childrens shoes 
the official news agency tass also said foreign visitors will be 
limited to 100 rubles worth of souvenirs that is 166 at the 
official rate or 2025 at the black market rate 
in the report sunday tass said the restrictions specifically 
applied to tourists 
the radical changes in export and customs regulations take effect 
feb 1 and last until the end of 1990 tass said the council of 
ministers approved the changes but did not give a date for the 
decision 
it also did not explain the effect of the ruling on the soviet 
unions attempts to earn scarce hard currency by selling the best 
caviar fur hats and coats vodka and souvenirs in stores that 
require dollars pounds or other freely convertible money 
tass said it will be forbidden to export televisions 
refrigerators freezers washing and sewing machines childrens 
clothing and shoes coffee and caviar coffee is not grown in the 
soviet union and the import duty is up to 15 a pound 
the announcement also said customs duties will climb to 20 to 100 
percent of the retail price on vacuum cleaners mixers 
coffeegrinders irons radios cameras automobile parts and other 
items it was not clear if this meant import or export duties 
export limits were imposed recently in czechoslovakia after 
complaints that tourists from neighboring soviet bloc nations were 
stripping its stores bare of consumer goods the practice prompted a 
soviet economist marina pavlovasilvanskaya to warn in soviet 
culture on sunday of an impending trade war among socialist 
countries 
many russians travel to eastern europe on shopping trips and ms 
pavlovasilvanskaya herself reminisced about trips to east germany 
and poland she said her boss insisted that the program had to 
include a visit to some institution named for lenin lest the 
germans or poles think the citizens of the nation of the great 
october revolution are coming to shop 
none of the socialist countries of eastern europe has fully 
convertible currencies and they trade with each other based on 
exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting countrys cost 
of production much less a profit 
ms pavlovasilvanskaya noted that capitalist countries dont 
find an invasion of shoppers a problem on nov 7 a holiday in 
hungary 100000 hungarians went to austria and spent 42 million in 
hard currency she wrote 
rather than limit exports the austrians responded to the horde 
of shoppers with advertisements in hungarian newspapers inviting 
them back on their next day off ms pavlovasilvanskaya noted

an african student from benin has been summarily 
sentenced to 15 days in prison following a bloody christmas eve 
brawl between chinese and africans in nanking an african diplomat 
said today 
it was the first report that a second african had been formally 
arrested in connection with the brawl that left 11 chinese and two 
africans injured 
the diplomat benins first secretary gobo bio mamah also 
quoted african students as saying that chinese police stripped and 
tortured two students from benin when they attacked 140 mostly 
african students at a guest house outside nanking on saturday 
we have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in the 
cold as police poked them with electric cattle prods mamah said 
they were doing this to make them talk it appears to be torture 
the brawl at nankings hehai university sparked five days of 
antiblack protests and resulted in most of the citys african 
students being forced by police to the guest house on dec 26 
the students had wanted to flee the eastcentral city for 
beijing but were stopped by police at nankings railway station 
african students said about 400 chinese police attacked them 
saturday in the guest house and removed about half of them 
returning some to their universities and sending others to another 
hotel 
the student witnesses said chinese police beat and detained seven 
or eight of their classmates one witness said police charged the 
students as loudspeakers broadcast platitudes about chinas great 
friendship with african nations 
another said he saw about seven police beating one student from 
the congo 
chinese news reports said only that a student from ghana alex 
dzabaku dosoo had been arrested and three other students held for 
questioning no mention was made of a student from benin 
but mamah said officials from the public security department in 
beijing told him sunday that student ludovic dossoumon had been 
sentenced without trial to 15 days in prison as punishment 
chinese authorities in beijing refused to specify dossoumons 
alleged crimes he said 
they told me the authorities in nanking were the only ones who 
could say anything mamah said this action is unacceptable 
chinese authorities at the ministry of public security said they 
were not clear about the arrests 
at least 50 students from hehai remained at the guest house 
today apparently because they still wanted to go to beijing the 
rest apparently were at another hotel or at their universities 
jiangsu province said today that they also were not clear about 
the arrests and the exact whereabouts of the students some of whom 
were from western europe japan and south asia 
a ghanian diplomat said china had broken an agreement to keep the 
students at the guest house until a delegation representing nine 
african countries returned to nanking 
the delegation came to nanking last tuesday for negotiations 
returned to beijing and was planning to go again to nanking later 
this week 
we dont know why they broke the agreement said the 
diplomat yn oheneakrasi but in light of the apparent police 
attack this is the least of our concerns 
chinese officials in nanking have made it clear that no chinese 
will be punished for the clash and subsequent demonstrations during 
which chinese students destroyed property in african student 
dormitories and shouted down with black devils 
in hangzhou capital of zhejiang province a standoff continued 
between 56 black africans and chinese at the zhejiang agricultural 
college the students have locked themselves in their dormitory 
since dec 26 because they allege chinese officials say they have 
the deadly disease aids 
college officials have denied the claim 
the weeklong incidents in nanking and in hangzhou are the latest 
in a series of incidents between chinese and chinas 1500 african 
students brought here to demonstrate chinas solidarity with the 
third world 
relations between chinese and africans are tense chinese are 
often openly racist and africans are frustrated by a culture that is 
very different from their own

passenger list was on the ship 
the sol e mar restaurant the boats operator referred calls to 
a local lawyer but no one answered the number given

gunmen of the mainstream amal militia and the fundamentalist 
hezbollah attacked each other with grenades and mortar barrages 
police said

the official libyan news agency claimed today the 
united states is using allegations about a chemical weapons plant in 
libya as a pretext to launch an attack and kill col moammar gadhafi 
the jana news agency monitored in rome referred to a report 
sunday in the united arab emirates daily alkhaleej that quoted 
unidentified arab sources as saying the americans planned to send a 
hit squad to kill the libyan leader during an attack 
alkhaleej claimed an american task force had trained in italy 
spain and aboard us warships in the mediterranean for the attack 
which it said could come this month the newspaper said the strike 
would include bombing attacks on the nuclear research center at 
tajura and the alleged chemical weapons plant at rabtah 
the newspaper report had no dateline but appeared to originate in 
the libyan capital tripoli jana gave the report unusual attention 
not only carrying a story but also sending it to foreign news 
agencies by telex and telefax 
the uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals and exposes 
clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hysterical campaign 
against libya jana said 
it said the report proves the us allegations about a chemical 
weapons plant were excuses and pretexts for an operation of 
premeditated individual murder 
the us government has contended libya is on the verge of 
producing chemical weapons at the plant near rabtah a city about 50 
miles southwest of tripoli libya insists the facility is a 
pharmaceutical plant 
west german officials are investigating us charges that a west 
german company played a key role in helping libya build the plant 
president reagan has said the united states had discussed with 
other nato countries the possibility of military action against the 
plant 
we are confident that the public opinion after knowing these 
facts will stand on our side said jana referring to the 
alkhaleej report 
jana repeatedly has carried denials by gadhafis government that 
the plant produces chemical weapons as well as statements of libyas 
commitment to treaties to ban such weapons 
on christmas eve gadhafi offered to return the body of an 
american pilot killed in the 1986 us bombing raids on libya he 
also called for the release of two french children held hostage in 
lebanon they were later freed 
jana has carried frequent stories on massive demonstrations 
in libyan cities to denounce the us threats and show support for 
the government 
on monday it said a group it called the international league in 
defense of the mediterranean condemned the sailing of a new us 
13ship carrier battle group for the mediterranean 
a us navy spokesman in washington called the sailing a routine 
deployment of the 6th fleet a navy spokesman in italy said the new 
group comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in the 
mediterranean

a top cabinet minister said today that 
israels latest deportation of palestinians violates human rights 
obstructs middle east peace efforts and runs counter to the jewish 
states own interests 
the criticism coincided with the disclosure that the egyptian and 
israeli foreign ministers will meet in paris on sunday egypt is the 
only arab state that has diplomatic relations with israel 
butros ghali minister of state for foreign affairs took israel 
to task in a statement to reporters on the expulsion of 13 
palestinians from the israelioccupied west bank and gaza to 
lebanon the action sunday brought to 49 the number of palestinians 
deported since an uprising against israeli occupation began dec 8 
1987 
egyptian leaders condemned earlier deportations in terms similar 
to those used today by ghali 
as ghali spoke foreign ministry sources said foreign minister 
esmat abdelmeguid will meet in paris next sunday with his israeli 
counterpart moshe arens 
it will be their first meeting since arens a member of the 
rightwing likud bloc took the foreign affairs portfolio in the 
cabinet formed by prime minister yitzhak shamir last month 
the last meeting at this level took place about three months ago 
in new york between abdelmeguid and shimon peres then israels 
foreign minister peres of the centerleft labor party is now 
finance minister 
arens and abdelmeguid will meet during a jan 711 international 
conference on the prevention of chemical weapons that both ministers 
are attending in paris 
ghali said egypt viewed the deportations as violations of the 
human rights of palestinians and a negative stance that obstructs 
the arabisraeli peace process 
he said the expulsions also encourage extremist tendencies 
among the various parties and conflict with the interests of the 
israeli people in taking advantage of available opportunities and a 
new climate for peace efforts 
this apparently referred to last months peace strategy announced 
by yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
arafat publicly recognized israel renounced what he said was all 
forms of terrorism and offered to hold peace talks with israel 
within the framework of an international conference 
arafats statements led the united states to open a dialogue with 
the plo

a state department official and a member of the 
house foreign affairs committee disagreed today on whether the 
united states needs a new policy on cuba 
i dont think we need a new policy i think the policys 
working said elliott abrams assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs 
its a policy of putting pressure on cuban president fidel 
castro to isolate him to make his economic situation more 
difficult to try to force him out of angola to try to force him to 
make human rights concessions thats whats working abrams said 
on the abctv program good morning america 
but rep robert torricelli dnj interviewed on the same 
program said to have an american policy that is basically based 
on the idea that we wish the revolution didnt happen we wish that 
hed go away is really foolish going into a fourth decade 
torricelli said he thinks a policy is needed that would require 
some reforms from castro in exchange for an improved relationship 
with the united states a policy that puts a real price on a new 
relationship a real price on his policies in nicaragua and angola 
and human rights at home we may find that that gets some results 
castro celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution said 
in a televised speech sunday night that it is socialism or death 
for cuba as he rejected marketoriented economic reforms his 
remarks seemed aimed at the soviet union and other communist 
countries that have been abandoning strict adherence to marxist 
doctrine 
torricelli said that despite the rhetoric i think theres some 
reason to believe there can be change 
he said the difficulty here is that he doesnt understand what 
necessarily is required for better relations and what 
presidentelect bush should be doing is spelling that out exactly 
we want some change of policy in nicaragua we want him to continue 
to adhere to not aiding violent revolution in latin america we want 
the angolan accords fulfilled we want his promises kept on 
immigration we want human rights changes in cuba 
abrams said that if castro wants a changed relationship with the 
united states probably his first real step has got to be 
implementing the angola agreement and taking the troops out 
but abrams said he thinks castro is a first generation 
communist leaderwho is unable to countenance a reduction in his 
personal power real democracy real change it will take the next 
generation coming i think for there to be real change in cuba

jim and tammy faye bakker returned to 
television today after a twoyear absence with a show broadcast from 
the living room of their borrowed home to a handful of stations 
around the country 
jim i think this is probably the happiest day of my life 
mrs bakker said as the show began sporting her trademark heavy eye 
makeup she began crying two minutes into the hourlong show 
bakker the founder of ptl left his television ministry in march 
1987 in the midst of a sex and money scandal he and his wife had 
not appeared on a television pulpit since january 1987 
today bakker told viewers and his supporters crowded into the 
house that his last television appearance was to break ground for 
the crystal palace church at heritage usa the home of ptl 
i believe that was the last straw for satan bakker said i 
think the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built 
i believe the devil said i have to smash jim and tammy 
bakker 
bakker said he believes that church which was designed to hold 
30000 people still will be built 
but since the bakkers left the ptl organization it has filed for 
protection under federal bankruptcy laws and last month a 
bankruptcy judge ordered its assets sold to a canadian businessman 
also last month bakker and a former top aide were indicted on 
charges including fraud and conspiracy 
bakker thanked a supporter who had donated the money to put him 
back on the air and said the program would be carried by more 
stations next month it is scheduled to be shown monday through 
friday 
we bought time mrs bakker said we had a certain amount 
of money and thats all the time we could buy and its not a lot of 
money but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful 
bakker did not make any direct appeal for donations in marked 
contrast to his old ptl club show he did give an address in 
fort mill sc if you want to write us 
callers to a telephone number not tollfree shown throughout 
the show were asked to give their name phone number and address but 
got no appeal for funds the callers were invited to ask the bakkers 
to pray for them 
bakker who turned 49 today said the program was being carried 
by television stations in los angeles philadelphia albany ny 
akron and canton ohio asheville nc and louisiana 
in amsterdam ny near albany wocd general manager fred 
wuenschel said the bakkers paid the usual rate per hour to be on 
the station he wouldnt say what that was 
the station has a 30day contract for the show he said he will 
keep the show on as long as they keep paying

mcc consider the election of lady members 
marylebone is one of just two menonly clubs left in topflight 
english cricket 
women can watch cricket at lords the clubs headquarters but 
not from the pavilion which is limited to members only not even 
women accompanying male members are allowed 
the newsletter noted that englands national womens cricket team 
even had played matches at lords and that the pavilion and 
clublike long room had been opened to women on those occasions 
as we approach the 21st centruy should this progress be 
taken further the newsletter asked 
it also sought to reassure diehard supporters of the menonly 
rules that no women members were likely anytime soon not with a 
waiting list of about 8000 
with the current waiting list none would be elected for some 
time but should we allow ladies to watch some cricket from the 
pavilion either as members or as guests of members the 
newsletter asked

an unofficial historian says he would like to 
dispute some of the writings of alexander solzhenitsyn but the work 
of the nobel prizewinning author of the gulag archipelago 
remains offlimits in the soviet union 
in the interview published sunday in the newspaper moscow young 
communist roy medvedev did not detail his criticism of 
solzhenitsyn both writers have examined the russian revolution and 
the mass repression of josef stalin solzhenitzyns threevolume 
gulag is a detailed chronicle of stalins labor camps 
medvedev who is widely known abroad but has seen his own 
articles published in the soviet union only in the past year said 
negotiations are under way to publish all or parts of many of his 
own books including works on stalin and on his successors nikita 
s khrushchev and leonid i brezhnev 
the journal znamya plans to publish the first part of his new 
book on stalin let history judge in its first issue this year 
medvedev said the entire book is slated for express production 
by progress publishers 
but medvedev said there is still no chance for the one book he 
would really like to publish here titled polemics with 
solzhenitsyn it consists of six or seven critical essays on the 
basic works of solzhenitsyn 
its too bad that everything connected with this writer remains 
a closed area medvedev said 
we mine gold from dirt and rock picking out the best washing 
to find the gold medvedev said its the same here 
solzhenitsyn must be published and criticized 
soviet intellectuals have called for publication of 
solzhenitsyns works 
but the kremlin ideology chief vadim medvedev said in november 
that publishing gulag archipelago and solzhenitsyns history of 
vladimir lenins life just before the russian revolution would 
undermine the foundations on which todays life rests 
the ideology chief who is not related to the historian said 
solzhenitsyns writing radically contradicts our social and 
political system our understanding of the world of history our 
attitude toward lenin 
solzhenitsyn traces stalins widescale repression back to lenin 
who is revered in the soviet union 
medvedev said his books the troubled spring of 1918 on the 
beginning of the soviet civil war and the socialist system and 
another on those who stood around stalin also are scheduled for 
publication

chinese paramilitary forces beat and used electric 
truncheons on african students during a fivehour attack on 140 
foreign students at a nanking guest house witnesses said monday 
an african diplomat gobo bio mamah of benin also reported 
allegations that chinese militiamen stripped and administered 
electric shocks to students during saturdays attack 
we have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in the 
cold as police poked them with electric cattle prods mamah said 
they were doing this to make them talk it appears to be torture 
mamah also said a benin student had been sentenced without 
trial to 15 days in prison following a bloody dec 24 clash between 
chinese and africans in nanking 
it was the first report a second african had been arrested in 
with the brawl that left 11 chinese and two africans injured the 
fight between chinese and african students at hehai university 
touched off five days of antiblack protests in nanking capital of 
jiangsu province 
a student from mali said he saw chinese forces at the guest house 
saturday using the electric prods all over the the foreigners 
bodies including their genitals 
they put their electric sticks everywhere but mostly on our 
sexes said daouda diakite a 24yearold student at nanking 
university luckily i succeded in defending myself i had friends 
around me 
they treated us like animals said another african student 
at the nanking pharmaceutical college they used an electric baton 
on my face 
a japanese student at nanking university said the police were 
brutal but she said she did not see them use their electric 
batons 
none of the allegations could be independently confirmed an 
american tv crew outside the guest house during the attack was 
prevented from entering chinese authorities say they are not 
clear about what happened at the guest house 
the problems in nanking and in another chinese city hangzhou 
are the latest in a series of incidents between chinese and 1500 
african students brought here to demonstrate chinas solidarity with 
the third world 
relations between the two have been tense chinese are often 
openly racist and africans are frustrated by a culture that is very 
different than their own 
chinese and african students fought at hehai on christmas eve 
after gatekeepers refused to allow two chinese women to attend a 
dance given by black african students 
antiblack protests followed and most of nankings 139 african 
students fled to the nanking train station they wanted to go to 
beijing but were stopped by about 150 police 
on dec 26 peoples armed police a paramilitary group forced 
the students to the guest house the following day diplomats from 
nine african countries came to nanking to speak with the students 
an agreement was made to keep the students in the guest house until 
the diplomats returned this week according to yn oheneakrasi 
minister counsellor at the ghanian embassy 
but on saturday the chinese broke the agreement he said 
african students said about 400 chinese militiamen attacked the 
students in the guest house 
students fought off the chinese throwing plates at them from the 
dining hall but soon realized that they were outnumbered diakite 
said 
the students then agreed to leave the dining hall and gather in a 
courtyard 
one african witness at nanking polytechnical college said police 
charged the students and another said he saw about seven police 
beating one student from the congo 
i saw people only men naked being shocked by the chinese and 
their weapons diakite said they shocked women too though 
also on their sexes 
witnesses said chinese arrested six to eight african students 
from hehai chinese reports said one ghanian student alex dzabaku 
dosoo had been arrested and three other students held for 
questioning no mention was made of a student from benin 
but the benin diplomat said that on sunday officials from the 
ministry of public security in beijing told him student ludovic 
dossoumon had been sentenced to 15 days in prison as punishment 
without trial 
chinese authorities in beijing refused to specify dossoumons 
alleged crimes mamah said 
they told me the authorities in nanking were the only ones who 
could say anything he said 
chinese authorities at the ministry of public security said they 
were not clear about the arrests 
on monday at least 50 students from hehai remained at the guest 
house apparently because they still wanted to go to beijing those 
who hadnt been returned to their schools apparently had been moved 
to another hotel 
meanwhile in hangzhou capital of zhejiang province a standoff 
continued between 56 black africans and chinese at the zhejiang 
agricultural college the students have locked themselves in their 
dormitory since last week because they allege chinese officials say 
they all have aids college officials have denied the claim

the 101st congress ceremonially convenes for 
its bicentennial session on tuesday firmly in the hands of 
democrats waiting to see whether the incoming republican president 
will be more conciliatory than the departing one 
we both know there will be things on which we cant agree 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said after a postelection 
meeting with presidentelect bush but he added that bush was a 
realist interested in forging a better link with congress 
the capitol hillwhite house relationship will be tested 
throughout the year as lawmakers grapple with the obstinate problem 
of the federal budget deficit and seek to map a new path for 
domestic and foreign policy but the first difficult item to 
confront lawmakers will be whether to give themselves as much as a 
45000 pay raise 
while there is some new leadership on capitol hill most 
prominently george mitchell of maine as the new senate majority 
leader the new congress will look a lot like the last one 
better than 98 percent of house incumbents and 92 percent of 
sitting senators who sought reelection will return for another 
term this years freshman class is the smallest in history 
eleven new senators five democrats and six republicans will 
take the oath of office as the first order of business when the 
chamber convenes the number includes republican rep dan coats of 
indiana appointed to replace vicepresident elect dan quayle who 
was resigning before his jan 20 inauguration to let coats be sworn 
in early 
in the house 33 freshmen will be sworn in 17 democrats and 16 
republicans they include georgia democrat ben jones who played 
cooter on tvs the dukes of hazzard mountain climber jolene 
unsoeld dwash and attorney and political novice ronald machtley 
the rhode island republican who knocked off scandaltainted 
democratic veteran fernand st germain 
house speaker jim wright dtexas will be reelected to a second 
term as speaker despite two ethics investigations into his finances 
and his alleged disclosure of classified information wrights 
firstday speech to the house will set the tone for the new session 
it is a day not of substance but of ceremony the visitors 
galleries on both sides of the capitol will be filled with 
lawmakers families there will be socializing picture taking and 
handshaking 
a few routine housekeeping details will be taken care of in both 
chambers including the organizing of committees and the adoption of 
rules 
tuesdays ceremonies and festivities will be followed by the 
formal counting of presidential electoral votes on wednesday the 
senate will convene then march as a body across the long corridor 
to the house chamber 
there bush acting in his constitutional role as president of 
the senate will open the certificates sent in from each state 
announce them in alphabetical order and declare himself the winner 
after two days in washington the new congress will leave again 
and not come back until inauguration day jan 20 real business 
gears up the following week and while bush may enjoy a limited 
honeymoon period partisan struggle lurks not far below the 
surface 
bushs first challenge will be to outline for congress his budget 
priorities and to show how he would save the 32 billion or so 
necessary to meet deficitreduction targets he has pledged to do it 
without raising taxes and democrats have been skeptical about 
whether that can be accomplished 
for their part democrats will be anxious to set their own policy 
course in many areas with a 5545 majority in the senate a 
oneseat gain from last year and the house at 260175 three better 
than the 100th congress the majority party believes it has as much 
a mandate as the new president 
leading the way will be two new budget committee chairmen leon 
panetta dcalif in the house and jim sasser dtenn in the 
senate other new chairmanships will go to rep jack brooks 
dtexas at the judiciary committee rep henry gonzalez dtexas 
and sen don riegle dmich at the banking committees former 
majority leader robert byrd dwva as head of senate 
appropriations and rep john conyers dmich house government 
operations 
in addition to the budget another early and difficult issue for 
the new congress will be where to set its own pay a presidential 
commission has recommended 50 percent salary hikes for lawmakers and 
some 2500 other top government officials in the executive and 
judicial branches president reagans budget due on capitol hill 
jan 9 will likely include an increase 
if both the house and senate do not vote to stop it whatever 
reagan recommends will automatically take effect on feb 8 house 
leaders have said they plan to let the raise happen but have 
promised to expedite a ban on honoraria the specialinterest 
speaking fees earned by many legislators 
senate committees also will face the immediate task of holding 
confirmation hearings on members of bushs cabinet and other top 
administration appointees hearings on former sen john towers 
nomination to be secretary of defense have been tentatively 
scheduled for inauguration week and the foreign relations committee 
is expected to hold early hearings on james bakers nomination as 
secretary of state 
the 101st congress is called the bicentennial congress because it 
will be meeting during the 200th anniversary of the date when the 
first congress was finally able to muster a quorum and officially 
convene on april 6 1789

cable television systems are offering more 
channels to more viewers but the price for watching is also going 
up 
in the two years since most cable systems were freed from 
municipal rate regulation their basic service rates have risen 
substantially however stability in premium channel rates which 
were never regulated has moderated the increase in the average 
overall cable bill 
the consumer price index for the 12 months through november shows 
that cable tv bills for urban viewers rose 133 percent while the 
overall index rose 42 percent during the period the cable increase 
during the previous year was 685 percent 
other trackers of cable prices however show different figures 
paul kagan associates a carmel calif research firm that 
compiles nationwide cable prices says the monthly rate for basic 
cable rose about 10 percent from a monthly average of 1320 last 
year to 1452 in 1988 with premium channels added in average 
monthly cable bills rose 56 percent over 1987 to 2473 a rate 
only slightly higher than inflation the firm says 
those in the industry say that for the two decades before 
deregulation took effect in january 1987 municipalities kept basic 
service rates artificially low with the freedom to charge what the 
market will bear cable systems have added more channels to the 
basic tier and raised prices 
sharon armbrust a senior analyst at kagan said the trend in 
steep increases for basic service is a twoyear phenomenon that 
already shows signs of stabilizing 
regular rates will track fairly closely with inflation and 
perhaps outpace it simply because of the new services being added 
she said there could be a consumer backlash if charges go up 
without new services but cable operators are sensitive to this 
its a subscription service you vote every month whether to buy 
it 
for some systems rates are still taking healthy leaps upward 
cable tv arlington in virginia is raising its monthly rate for basic 
service 54 channels by 111 percent to 1995 that increase 
comes on top of an 18 percent increase last august media general 
cable of fairfax va is raising its rate for basic service of 83 
channels by nearly 19 percent to 1895 it last raised its rates a 
year ago 
on the more moderate side telecommunications inc the nations 
largest cable company operating systems with more than 4 million 
subscribers says it will raise its basic monthly rates an average 
of 7 percent in 1989 to an average 1550 
so far consumers appear to be doing little more than shrugging 
their shoulders at the increases 
the number of homes subscribing to cable service grew this year 
by about 8 percent to 486 million representing 538 percent of 
all us television households about 80 percent of all homes are 
wired for cable 
people value television choice in their home they want to have 
a lot of channels and theyre willing to pay for it said charles 
e walters vice president of a washington dcbased consulting 
firm 
decker anstrom executive vice president of the national cable 
television association says cable packs a lot of entertainment 
value for the price 
rates are increasing but if you look at the overall universe 
cable is priced quite reasonably he said for about 50 cents a 
day the average cable subscriber receives 35 channels its a good 
entertainment buy 
these arguments have been made to congress but have failed to 
assure some including sen howard metzenbaum dohio that 
consumers interests rather than a bottom line are being served by 
cable companies 
metzenbaum plans to introduce legislation in the upcoming session 
to strengthen the ability of cities to regulate cable rates said 
eddie correia an aide to the senator 
the deregulation that took hold in 1987 precluded rate regulation 
in virtually every metropolitan area under the theory that systems 
in heavily populated areas face competition from other media 
sources including many overtheair broadcast signals but correia 
said even in metropolitan areas cable can lock out competition by 
refusing to sell its programming to other sources like wireless 
cable and backyard satellite dishes 
its the worst of both worlds you have monopolies but you have 
no ability to regulate them he said 
nicholas miller a washingtondcbased communications lawyer 
who represents municipalities on cable issues also characterizes 
cables operators as monopolies based on their pricing practices 
they price based on what people are willing to pay not what it 
costs them to deliver the service he said

the freshup lounge a 20year tradition announced it will once

finis that leaves a mere 400000 to mail but theres no rush 
theyre commemoratives that wont admit anyone to anything ive 
seen them framed on walls all over the country insists committee 
spokesman ed cassidy they are extremely popular 
for those who arent even on the commemorative list the 
inaugural catalog offers consolations ranging in price from 95 cents 
to 1195 the cheapest item is a schoolbook cover depicting bush 
and george washington in keeping with the inaugurals bicentennial 
george to george theme at the top end of the scale devotees 
can purchase eagles 1195 for steuben glass or boehm china 
for couch potatoes and the politically unconnected the committee 
is offering for 2995 a vcr tape that promises buyers the inaugural 
bicentennial captured for years of enjoyment and historical 
significance hollywood producer jerry weintraub a bush 
supporter is making the tape 
half of the onehour tape will be historical and the other half 
will hit the high points of the bushquayle inauguration according 
to stephen studdert executive director of the committee he said 
all schools in the country will be given a copy 
for the traditionbound the catalog offers the usual medals 
ranging from 2950 for a bronze art medal to 920 for a collectors 
set and inaugural license plates available for 50 and usable in 
any state until march 31 
but not everything in the catalog is generic some items have 
been chosen to reflect the incoming presidents tastes and 
background horseshoe belt buckles and key rings texas chili mix 
and coasters made of maine slate golf shirts and navystyle caps 
like the ones he wears 
you wont find official inaugural dried pork rinds you will find 
commemorative blazer buttons but officials strenuously deny that 
they are there to recall bushs preppie image a distinct liability 
early in his white house campaign 
no blazer buttons have an important place in inaugural history 
seems george washington wore special buttons engraved with the arms 
of the new government at his inaugural ceremony this years set 10 
brass buttons for 65 is engraved with the bicentennial inaugural 
seal 
most of the cost of the inauguration expected to top 20 
million will come from ball and gala ticket sales but the 
committee hopes to net more than 2 million from its catalog items

one hundred professors and other prominent 
personalities have signed a petition asking the government for open 
elections to parliament in 1989 spokesmen for the group said monday 
the petition presented to the government ombudsmans office dec 
30 and given to western news agencies said that any citizen should 
have the right to run for the sejm or parliament after being 
nominated by a certain portion of eligible voters 
for example the group said signatures by 1 percent of a 
districts electorate could be sufficient to nominate a candidate 
under polands current arrangement nominations to parliament 
elections are controlled by the communist party which in effect 
determines how many seats go to communists to allied political 
parties and to nonparty members 
communists have always received an automatic majority of the 
seats since the party consolidated power in poland after world war 
ii and held the first postwar parliament elections in 1947 
elections are planned this year after the drafting of a new 
election law deputies serve fouryear terms and the last elections 
were held in october 1985 
in his new years eve message to the nation polish leader 
wojciech jaruzelski said he would like the new parliament to more 
clearly reflect the natural differentiation of attitudes and views 
within society 
among those signing the petition to the ombudsman were film 
director andrzej wajda the rector of warsaw university grzegorz 
bialkowski the leader of the polish economic society aleksander 
paszczynski and leader of the polish pen writers club julius

where most people list their job 
experiences operation rescue founder randall terrys resume brags 
arrested 26 times in seven cities 
terry complains its outofdate 
it might be closer to 30 right now the 29yearold activist 
said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in 
upstate new york where the latest protests against abortion are 
being planned 
since its national debut at the democratic national convention in 
atlanta last summer operation rescue has made abortion a 
highprofile issue again 
terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion 
clinics throughout the country lying in front of doors until police 
carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras 
terry says he is trying to produce the social tension 
necessary to change abortion laws by using the nonviolent 1960s 
civil rights protest as a model 
hes the martin luther king of a movement said dominick 
brignola an albany lawyer and footsoldier in the antiabortion 
drive 
terrys critics claim operation rescue so named because 
followers try to rescue the unborn is an assault on womens 
rights 
the civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people 
theyre trying to take away the rights of living breathing human 
beings said molly yard president of the national organization 
for women 
more than 450 antiabortion demonstrators clogged atlanta jails 
during the fiveday democratic convention since then 
demonstrations have spread to new york city indianapolis 
milwaukee detroit philadelphia and boston and still more cities 
the activists want the supreme court to overturn roe vs wade 
its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions an estimated 
16 million women have abortions each year in the united states 
standing at the forefront of operation rescue is a used car 
salesman who once wanted to be a rock star 
terry and his wife cindy began their crusade in 1984 by 
standing in front of abortion clinics trying to talk women out of 
entering friends soon joined them and the couple opened an office 
that offered women free pregnancy tests and handmedown baby 
clothes 
god clicked a light on in my head and said it wasnt enough to 
just be against childkilling that i had to do something about 
it said terry whos selling his auto dealership because he is 
too busy with operation rescue 
critics concede terry has a mesmerizing personality he even 
tries to convert relatives at family reunions said dawn marvin of 
rochester his aunt 
terry was reared in a lowkey protestant environment but quit 
high school at 17 dreaming of a career in music said marvin who 
is communications director for the rochester chapter of planned 
parenthood a medical service that antiabortion pickets frequently 
target she stressed that she does not speak for the organization 
about her nephew 
he went away and he flipped out she said about terrys 
transformation into a bornagain christian he came back a totally 
changed personality it was more like a cult reaction than a 
spiritual quest 
marriage and his highly public role as operation rescue spokesman 
have calmed him somewhat she said the terrys have one child and 
three foster children 
terry dismisses his aunts comments including her assessment 
that hes an egomaniac lapping up news media attention 
to margaret johnston administrator at southern tier womens 
services in binghamton operation rescue is nothing new she said 
antiabortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and 
glued the clinics door shut four or five times 
terrys first arrest came in january 1986 when he chained himself 
to a sink at the clinic which performs abortions he was jailed for 
22 days for refusing to pay a 60 fine 
it doesnt matter what you say to him there is no reason 
involved johnston said he doesnt care about women i think he 
really hates women 
iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the 
binghamton clinic a court order keeps the nearly everpresent 
demonstrators at shouting distance 
they really want to make it personal johnston said 
even when she has run into him on a saturday in the post office 
johnston said terry has shouted at her how many babies did you 
murder today 
terry criticizes the antiabortion movement as being too nice 
during the 1980s pacified by the presence of an ideological friend 
like president reagan into not working hard for its goal 
we cry that abortion is murder its childkilling and yet we 
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters he 
said thats not an adequate response to murder a logical 
response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the 
victim 
the lean bushyhaired terry expects and even hopes his 
demonstrators will be arrested he claims operation rescue was 
responsible for 11000 arrests in 1988 and predicts 500000 will be 
arrested in 1989 
there are no situations he said when abortions are justified 
in most areas of life its ok for people to follow their own 
beliefs but not when it comes to having innocent children 
murdered he said 
thats like saying why cant a white man follow his own 
conscience concerning owning a black slave why cant a german 
follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot jews 
terry has attracted some prominent supporters including former 
presidential candidate pat robertson who said he backs any means 
short of violence to stop abortion 
if antiabortion demonstrators set their minds to it terry said 
they could change abortion laws in six months because the political 
system is not built to deal with mass protests 
yard dismisses terry as a puppet groomed for the role of 
point man in the latest antiabortion offensive 
women are really outraged by the whole thing she said the 
reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings of 
abortion clinics and operation rescue is that people dont believe 
roe vs wade can be overturned im not so sanguine all i know 
is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can 
at operation rescues office a competing outcry is being plotted 
pinned to the wall is a large map of the united states with 
abortion mills dotted in red terry distractedly complains to a 
staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will 
take him to a television appearance 
as a photographer snaps pictures he removes his foot from his 
desk saying thats too casual for someone trying to change world 
history 
he adds chuckling its comical really i think god has a 
sense of humor dont you think its rather funny that a former used 
car salesman is heading such a movement

almost all african nations were 
falling further behind the worlds developed countries the 
executive secretary of the united nations economic commission for 
africa said monday 
the un official adebayo adedeji also called for fundamental 
changes in structural adjustment programs mandated by major lending 
institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary 
fund 
structural adjustment programs usually require significant 
economic belttightening by nations receiving world bank or imf aid 
and debtor nations frequently complain the measures often lead to 
hardship and civil unrest 
adebayo delivering a yearend assessment to an audience of 
diplomats and economists at the commissions headquarters in 
ethiopias capital said africas economy did not keep pace with its 
population growth in 1988 
he predicted an even more dismal decline in 1989 
adebayo said africas combined economy grew at a rate of 25 
percent in 1988 compared with 13 percent in 1987 however he 
said that was offset by population growth of about 3 percent 
a decadelong pattern of slow economic growth coupled with rapid 
population increases has left the average african with an income 
only about 80 percent of what it was in 1980 adebayo said 
he noted that demand for african exports remains weak and said 
the continents economy has been sapped and weakened by the burden 
of debt in spite of the perceptible recovery of the industrial 
economies 
he put the combined debt of african nations at 230 billion at 
the close of 1988 compared with 218 billion in 1987 
adebayo said improved weather conditions that put an end to 
droughts in many parts of africa in 1988 were expected to continue 
in 1989 but that resulting improvements in agriculture were likely 
to be offset by further declines in commodity prices africas basic 
agricultural exports are coffee tea cocoa and vegetable oils

a navajo county deputy sheriff was pinned down this morning in a 
cabin near here and fired shots at an officers car authorities 
said 
sgt allan schmidt a spokesman for the arizona department of 
public safety said shots were exchanged with one of two suspects in 
the fatal shooting of deputy bob varner but no one was hit 
the owner of the cabin who does not live there full time called 
police this morning after he went to the cabin and recognized that 
something was amiss schmidt said 
varner died today at barrow neurological center in phoenix where 
he was taken after being shot saturday night after two men opened 
fire during a routine traffic stop authorities said 
the man inside the house is believed to be douglas savory 45 
who also is known as douglas savorey and douglas toad wolf schmidt 
said he said the man is armed with at least one automatic weapon 
the other suspect identified earlier as raul lopez about 25 is 
not at the cabin the two were believed to have split up earlier 
schmidt said 
savory told a couple who were victimized by the two suspects 
after the shooting saturday that he was a survivalist and dont 
believe in hurting people but there are times when its necessary 
the two had approached the home of bud and betty hunt pretending 
to have car trouble and then tied up the two and took their car 
the hunts were not injured 
after dps and navajo county authorities arrived at the cabin 
today shots were fired from the house at a sheriffs patrol car 
but no one was injured schmidt said 
he said interstate 40 was closed in both directions about 3 miles 
east of winslow because the cabin where the man is holed up is 
only a few hundred yards from the highway 
the cabin was surrounded and that at least two helicopters were 
being used to help keep the building under surveillance were 
waiting for a swat team from flagstaff and developing a plan to 
handle this guy schmidt said

accused savory of robbery and kidnapping in a september gunstore 
robbery in which five other people have been arrested schmidt said 
he had no other details on the robbery 
he also has been investigated in connection with manufacturing 
and sale of illegal weapons and explosivies and he is well known 
to authorities at the california state and federal level 
schmidt said 
he said lopez may be a citizen of mexico but we have very 
little on his background the spokesman said 
varner apparently stopped the two suspects about 730 pm 
saturday but we dont know the circumstances of why he stopped 
that car schmidt said there were at least 17 bullet holes in the 
windshield of varners car sheriff gary butler said he was hit 
three times

the private papers of former british prime minister 
harold macmillan show his government kept secret the details of a 
1957 accident at an atomic power plant that contaminated milk at 
about 800 farms according to a published report 
the release sunday of macmillans papers marked the first time 
full details have been revealed about the spring 1957 accident at 
the windscale nuclear plant in cumbria northwest england the 
papers were cited in a report by the observer a london newspaper 
the papers show that macmillan kept the information secret 
because he feared shaking public confidence in the industry and 
jeopardizing collaboration with the united states 
the observer cited the documents as saying the accident 
contaminated milk with high levels of strontium 90 a deadly isotope 
found in radioactive fallout the newspaper said the milk was sold 
to the public without any warning 
in a secret memo to macmillan on sept 12 1957 agriculture 
minister john hare estimated 800 or more farms may be affected 
by an escape of strontium 90 and that the readings on some of 
these farms have been many times higher than the national average 
the observer said 
it said hare also wrote that no action was being taken to 
prevent milk being consumed or produced on farms in the area 
the paper quoted john dunstan a former director of the staterun 
national radiological protection board as saying full details of 
the amount of radioactivity released in the accident were not 
disclosed to the board until 1986 the release of the information 
came in connection with an inquiry into increased childhood leukemia 
near the plant now known as sellafield 
the newspaper did not report the cause of the accident and made 
no mention of any deaths attributed to it 
macmillans documents were made public by the public records 
office under rules permitting publication of selected confidential 
papers after 30 years 
government papers made public a year ago said macmillan also 
suppressed a report on britains worst ever nuclear accident at 
windscale on oct 10 1957 the report said the accident was caused 
by a fire 
sales of milk from an area measuring more than 200 square miles 
around the plant were banned after a release of radioactivity the 
accident caused no immediate deaths 
the problemplagued plant on the irish sea is one of the wests 
oldest commercial atomic power stations and largest nuclear 
reprocessing plants it reprocesses used nuclear fuels from britain 
and other countries to extract uranium and plutonium for making 
nuclear bombs

an exhibition of modern art from 
the new york and venice guggenheim collections drew 121000 visitors 
during its display at pragues national gallery officials said 
on sunday the last day of the exhibit it took visitors 1 hours 
to make it through the line to the second floor of sternberk palace 
where 50 paintings by 33 artists have hung since early november 
the guggenheim exhibit brought to prague expressionist cubist 
futurist constructivist and surrealist masterpieces 
it was preceded last summer by a czech national gallery exhibit 
of 60 canvases in new yorks guggenheim museum of modern art 
on display in prague were paintings by artists such as pablo 
picasso marc chagall max ernst salvador dali joan miro jackson 
pollock and jean dubuffet 
the two shows were based on a 1986 cultural agreement and a 
10year friendship between guggenheim director thomas m messer and 
jiri kotalik the director of the prague gallery 
its a sign of improving relations it could not have happened 
five years ago said messer adding he saw the exhibit not 
merely as an art show but as a very significant cultural event 
its the first time ever that a full survey of 20th century 
paintings has been presented in any of the socialist 
countries he said in an interview 
he noted however that the show focused on the period 190045 
and that a second exhibit would be needed to show contemporary art 
this thought was echoed also in some of the entries in the 
visitors book and complaints that the works on show were already 
wellknown from literature 
most however were grateful thank you we ourselves are not 
likely to get to new york wrote one visitor another said 
thanks but wish there had been more 
there were so many visitors up to 4200 a day that after a few 
days the gallery announced it was extending viewing time until 8 
pm two days a week 
artwork necessarily creates an atmosphere of international 
understanding wrote the trade union daily newspaper prace art 
can speak with the same urgency to people throughout the world 
the womens weekly vlasta said we can only wish that the 
useful international cooperation continues after all it brings 
enrichment for both countries for us especially an expansion of 
knowledge of the various trends of contemporary 20th century art

the soviet union appears bent on a 
political solution in cambodia and has urged its vietnamese allies 
to withdraw their occupation forces western and soviet diplomats 
say 
the kremlin denies pressuring vietnam to pull out but deputy 
foreign minister igor a rogachev has called a partial withdrawal in 
1988 an avenue toward a speedy solution that could improve 
soviet relations with china 
a summit of the two largest communist powers is expected this 
year and cambodia might head the agenda vietnam invaded its 
southeast asian neighbor in december 1978 ousted the bloody khmer 
rouge regime and installed another government 
in bangkok thailand a western diplomat said of the 
chinesesoviet dispute over cambodia i think theyve both decided 
to put this one behind them to sweep this one under the rug 
moscow backs hanoi and its client regime in phnom penh beijing 
arms khmer rouge guerrillas and other rebel groups fighting that 
government 
the soviet unions apparent retrenchment after a decade fits its 
current policy of shedding or reducing costly foreign involvements 
it also does not appear to relish being cambodias major donor of 
foreign aid 
this kind of monopoly we certainly do not like said a soviet 
diplomat in phnom penh he said his country was especially unhappy 
about having to provide all cambodias oil on credit 
most western analysts believe the soviet union wants to retain 
its influence in cambodia vietnam and laos but at a level that 
would not antagonize china or the noncommunist nations of the 
region with which moscow seeks better economic and political 
relations 
although the soviet investment in cambodia is substantial it 
does not approach the amount the kremlin has committed to 
afghanistan or to neighboring vietnam and moscow has not carried 
out pledges of reconstruction made 10 years ago 
official cambodian media said the soviet union extended aid worth 
133 million in 197980 to help overcome famine and devastation 
caused by nearly four years of khmer rouge governemtn 
aid levels are believed to have been substantially lower since 
but no reliable estimates are available washington estimates the 
soviets pour the equivalent of more than 3 billion a year into 
vietnam 
several hundred soviet advisers are stationed in cambodia 
involved in projects ranging from a ground satellite station to a 
veterinary medicine center 
soviet pilots fly planes of the cambodian airline and engineers 
sent by the kremlin are renovating the electric power supply system 
by 1990 more than 3500 scholarships are expected to have been 
provided for cambodians studying in the soviet union 
most of the bill for cambodias army and the vietnamese 
occupation force also goes to the kremlin western analysts say that 
is an important reason the soviets want to get the vietnamese out 
and reach a political solution with rebel groups 
little soviet blood has been shed in cambodia and moscow has not 
installed a naval base at the kompong som port as some observers 
expected it also has not built the roads communications and other 
facilities needed in a country plagued for nearly 20 years by war 
khmer rouge rule invasion and insurgency 
according to soviet diplomats their government wants to cut 
unnecessary items from the current aid program they scoff at some 
suggestions from their aid bureaucracy like establishing a circus 
or getting involved in tourism 
one diplomat noting deficiencies in the soviet unions own 
development of tourism said the cambodians saw the light and 
decided to invite hong kong businessmen to restore a firstclass 
hotel in phnom penh

an armenian newspaper has printed an alleged threat 
by armenian militants to wage terrorist attacks with usmade 
stinger missiles if their leaders are not freed from jail the 
activists called it a fake 
the purported letter published by kommunist the armenian 
communist party daily newspaper demands the immediate release of 
members of the karabakh committee a group that has led an 11month 
campaign for the annexation of nagornokarabakh a predominantly 
armenian region of azerbaijan 
if the committees leaders are not freed the unsigned document 
says we will have recourse to mass terror in our arsenals 
we have stingers provided by our friends 
a facsimile copy of the purported document was published in 
kommunists dec 28 editions which reached moscow over the weekend 
kommunist said the letter was received by lawenforcement officials 
and labeled to be transmitted to the kgb 
it made no additional reference to the stingers many of the 
usmanufactured groundtoair missiles have been shipped by the 
united states to afghan insurgents fighting their countrys 
promoscow government 
rafael popoyan an armenian activist said the letter printed by 
kommunist was a total fabrication from beginning to end and 
another attempt by officials to discredit the karabakh committee 
militants 
sergei grigoryants an armenianrussian activist who was released 
last week after 30 days in jail in yerevan the armenian capital 
for filming soldiers who are enforcing a curfew said the 
grammatical construction of the letter was too complicated for most 
armenians the letter was written in russian which armenians learn 
in school in addition to their own language and alphabet 
at a news conference in moscow grigoryants also distributed a 
copy of an interview with ashot manucharyan a member of the 
armenian supreme soviet legislature who grigoryants said is a 
fugitive because of his nationalist activities 
manucharyan was quoted as saying he was told about such 
threatening letters by the armenian kgb secret police five months 
ago when no members of the karabakh committee were under detention 
popoyan said the appearance of the article may herald a further 
crackdown by soviet authorities on the committee seven of whose 
members are now in jail and the other four reportedly in hiding to 
avoid arrest 
now that so many members of the committee have been arrested 
there is no one to answer these ridiculous charges popoyan said 
speaking by telephone from yerevan the press is now closed to 
anyone from the committee 
soviet authorities jailed committee leaders after the dec 7 
earthquake in northwestern armenia authorities have accused 
committee members of sabotaging the earthquake relief effort and 
whipping up ethnic tensions by continuing to seek nagornokarabakhs 
annexation by armenia a demand the kremlin has refused

1978 slaying of a restaurateur who took his covergirl lover away 
from him has been granted permission to seek a new trial 
howard buddy jacobson who says hes being treated for bone 
cancer in attica state prison was granted permission to file new 
motions on feb 1 by appellate division judge richard w wallach 
newsday reported monday the ruling was made dec 8 the newspaper 
said 
three previous appeals of jacobsons conviction of murdering jack 
tupper have been denied 
jacobson 58 one of the nations most successful thoroughbred 
horse trainers in the 1960s and 1970s maintains that tupper was a 
narcotics dealer slain in a drug dispute 
im innocent plain and simple jacobson told newsday from 
attica 
the government with model melanie cain a major witness in an 
11week trial in 1980 said jacobson shot and stabbed tupper to 
death because miss cain left him after four years and moved into an 
apartment across the hall with tupper 
jacobsons lawyer herald price fahringer said a new trial will 
be sought on grounds that the prosecution hid statements by a 
witness who said jacobson was not one of the three men she saw at 
the site where tuppers body was dumped 
miss cain 33 now an actress with a 3yearold daughter told 
newsday she still believed jacobson guilty and would be shocked if

and efficient than current aeroflot jets the tass news agency said 
the 214seat airliner is to go into service at the end of 1990 
and be one of aeroflots principal mediumrange carrier in the 
1990s tass said 
the evening tv news program vremya showed a yellow 
twinengine jet on a tarmac in moscow preparing for its 32minute 
flight news reports did not say if any problems were found in the 
flight 
the tu204 belongs to a new generation of airliners 
economical equipped with most uptodate electronic systems and 
instruments of soviet make and very comfortable for passengers 
tass said 
chief engineer of the new plane l lanovsky told tass it will 
have wider corridors and more leg room than the soviet unions 
notoriously cramped airliners 
the plane will be built in modules so firstclass and 
businessclass sections also can be built in he said some aeroflot 
planes that fly international routes have businessclass sections 
but there is no such differentiation on domestic flights 
it will be much more energy efficient than the tupolev 154 
currently the most efficient soviet passenger jet tass said 
tass said test pilots and engineers will test up to 3000 
components of the plane in the next 12 to 18 months and that it 
probably will be displayed at international air shows before it goes 
into general service 
the tu204 is likely to replace the tu154 on some routes it has 
been carrying passengers on regular routes since 1972

president ramaswamy venkataraman on 
monday rejected an appeal for clemency for one of the two sikhs 
condemned to death for the 1984 assassination of prime minister 
indira gandhi defense lawyers said 
lawyers for kehar singh and satwant singh said they would file 
another round of appeals tuesday to halt their executions 
ram jethmalani the defense attorney for kehar singh said the 
earliest his client could be hanged was at dawn wednesday but said 
he would launch appeals in the trial court appellate court and 
supreme court on tuesday 
under indian law a man condemned to be executed has to be hanged 
within seven days of the issue of the death warrants but not before 
24 hours from the time it is issued 
s mohapatra superintendent of the maximumsecurity tihar jail 
where the convicted men are lodged said monday he had received the 
black warrants for the executions but refused to say when they 
would take place 
rupinder s sodhi defense attorney for satwant singh said 
venkataraman sent a letter monday to kehar singhs son rajinder 
informing him of the decision to turn down the plea for mercy 
it was the second time he has turned down a mercy petition by 
kehar singh 54 
after carefully considering the petition the president of 
india has declined to grant pardon or any other relief and has 
rejected the petition the letter said 
it gave no reason for the rejection which vacated the stays of 
execution for kehar singh and satwant singh 
the two men are not related all male sikhs take the name of 
singh which means lion in the punjabi language by doctrine of 
their faith 
satwant singh has not filed a mercy petition with the president 
but under indian law his death sentence was automatically delayed 
when kehar singh asked for clemency 
sodhi said satwant singh would not ask the president for clemency 
mrs gandhi was shot in the garden of her new delhi residence on 
oct 31 1984 by two of her sikh bodyguards one of them beant 
singh was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later 
the other satwant singh was arrested tried and sentenced to the 
gallows 
kehar singh an uncle of beant singh was convicted of conspiracy 
and sentenced to death 
mrs gandhis assassination was in apparent revenge for an army 
raid she had ordered four months earlier on the golden temple 
sikhisms holiest shrine to clear the complex of sikh militants 
entrenched inside 
on oct 30 kehar singh filed his first mercy petition it was 
dismissed by the president nov 24 and the two men were ordered to 
hang on dec 2 
but kehar singhs lawyers challenged the presidents decision in 
the supreme court arguing venkataraman had powers to review the 
case the court granted a stay 15 hours before the two were to be 
hanged 
on dec 16 the supreme court ordered the president to reconsider 
the appeal 
a trial court convicted them in 1986 and sentenced them to death 
the convictions and death sentences were upheld by an appeals court 
later that year and by the supreme court last august 
sikhs who make up 2 percent of indias 880 million people claim 
they are discriminated by the hindus the countrys religious 
majority accounting for over 80 percent of the population 
militant sikhs are fighting a 6yearold guerrilla war for a 
separate nation in punjab over 2400 deaths last year were blamed 
on the militants

she was one of 12 teenagers left with 
severe burns after the church bus crash that killed 27 people last 
year but trina muller is learning to adjust 
friends counselors and even strangers are helping 
one day this kid looked at me and said what happened to your 
hands and face and my friends ran up to him and said if you 
dont like what you see dont look trina said 
garry king principal at jt alton middle school said survivors 
of the may 14 crash deserve the credit for a smooth transition in 
returning to school 
these kids are fantastically courageous king said its 
been an inspiration for me 
trina must wear skintight pressure garments that doctors say 
will help prevent her burns from leaving hideous scars she thinks 
the fleshcolored suit that covers her from her head to her knees is 
ugly 
if the doctor told me i didnt have to wear it anymore id 
throw a party she said 
still the 14yearold doesnt let the chin strap prevent her 
from endless phone conversations with friends or the pressure gloves 
from wearing several rings over them 
life goes on for trina and the 39 others who nearly burned to 
death inside the church bus after it was hit headon by a pickup 
truck driver 
police say larry mahoneys truck crashed into the bus from the 
first assembly of god church in radcliff while he was driving the 
wrong way on interstate 71 the bus returning to radcliff after the 
church group spent the day at an amusement park north of cincinnati 
burst into flames 
the 67 people aboard survived the impact but three adults and 24 
children died as they tried to escape the burning bus 
mahoney 35 of worthville pleaded innocent to 27 counts of 
murder and other charges including drunken driving he was released 
from jail on 540000 bond oct 10 
aside from periodic absences for surgery the student survivors 
are all back in school doctors and therapists monitor their healing 
to see what they can do to limit disfigurement for the seven who had 
skin grafts 
the hardin county school system has worked to smooth the way for 
the students by inviting a burn specialist to lead a seminar for 
school staff in august sharon rengers a nurse at kosair childrens 
hospital in louisville gave a similar presentation to students at 
alton middle school in september 
she said many teenagerss associate burn patients with freddy 
krueger the disfigured character in the nightmare on elm street 
horror movies i have to tell them burn patients are not 
monsters theyre the same people they just look different 
but she said its natural for patients to worry about their 
looks physical appearance is a big part of our culture its even 
more important for teens 
the battle now therapists say is to get the patients to wear 
the pressure garments trina said her friends yell at her when she 
tries to take them off but other students have resisted the 
treatment because the garments are noticeable and often 
uncomfortable 
dotty pearman said her daughter christy a freshman at north 
hardin high school has come home in tears on several occasions 
after people commented about her appearance or voice which is 
deeper because her vocal chords burned grew together and had to be 
surgically separated 
christy also has second and thirddegree burns on her arm and 
shoulders 
said christy the memory will always be there and then you 
look down and see the scar to remind you

president reagan said today the united states 
has heard nothing from yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization on help in tracking down those responsible 
for last months bombing of a pan american jetliner over scotland 
weve not heard from him reagan told reporters upon landing 
here after spending the new years weekend in palms springs if he 
has anything to tell us im sure hell tell us 
fbi director william sessions had said on sunday that arafat has 
a wealth of information that could help in the investigation of 
the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 that killed 270 people 
without the plos help sessions said on two television interview 
shows the govenment expects a lengthy manhunt but is optimistic 
that those responsible will be found eventually 
were set up for the long haul he said we have a pattern 
and reputation for being able to solve such crimes 
the fbi chief said he would welcome any help arafat and his 
palestine liberation organization might provide he said contacts 
between the fbi and arafat presumably could be set up by the state 
department 
us and plo officials recently opened talks on the arabisraeli 
conflict after arafat disavowed terrorism and recognized israels 
right to exist 
sessions said arafat has a great deal of information a wealth 
of information he can give us 
last week the kuwaiti newspaper alseyasseh quoted an 
unidentified plo official as saying the organization was considering 
a request by us officials that the plo help in tracking down those 
responsible for the bombing 
while welcoming arafats help in identifying possible suspects in 
the pan am crash sessions said he opposes any attempt by the plo 
leader to retaliate by killing any suspects 
arafat has blamed terrorists for bringing down the jetliner 
condemning it as an inhuman criminal action 
asked about reports that arafat is consider organizing an 
assassination team to retailiate against those who planted the bomb 
sessions said we believe in the system of justice we hope those 
people are handled in the courts 
sessions said he has no evidence as yet to confirm the bombing 
was the work of terrorists rather than a nonpolitical criminal act 
aimed at an individual on board the jet 
he also said that 62 bodies from the crash have been identified 
through fingerprinting 
meawhile alan mcartor head of the federal aviation 
adminstration also appeared on meet the press and defended the 
policy of not publicizing threats to airliners 
these threats are transmitted on a routine basis he said 
but mcartor conceded that it was mistake for the united states to 
warn overseas embassy personnel about the threat to pan am jets 
while not alerting the public 
personally i dont think it was managed well he said 
mcartor said an alert has been issued to the athens airport and 
others in the mediterranean area to be on the lookout for false 
passports 
there has been movement of some known terrorists who have in 
their possession false passports mcartor said 
he also said the faa will negotiate with european allies to seek 
improved airline security 
this is a threat against civil aviation its not just isolated 
to american carriers he said 
on cbs face the nation sen william cohen rmaine and 
rep lee hamilton dind said the united states should keep open 
the possibility of military retaliation against any nation linked to 
terrorist attacks 
the military option always has to be there hamilton said 
but we dont want to indiscriminately bomb areas 
in london british prime minister margaret thatcher distanced 
herself from us talk of punishing whoever planted the bomb 
i dont think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever 
valid she said the most important thing to do is to try to get 
the cooperation of all nations to track these people down so that 
they are brought to justice she said in a british television 
interview

a revamped christian science monitor makes its 
debut tuesday with color photography fewer pages and less 
advertising all aimed at streamlining the newspaper mary baker eddy 
founded 80 years ago 
the changes prompted an exodus in november of top management at 
the churchrun daily newspaper including the departure of pulitzer 
prizewinning editor katherine fanning 
but company executives said monday that five years of research 
showed the newspapers readers faced with other demands on their 
time wanted more concise articles and greater selectivity of 
coverage 
in short they continue to look to the monitor for the context 
and perspective of events and want a serious paper that can be read 
thoroughly in about 30 minutes john h hoagland jr manager of 
the christian science publishing society said monday in a statement 
the society publishes the monitor 
the newspaper published monday through friday with a circulation 
of about 170000 is still a tabloid but it will now be 20 pages 
smaller by about eight pages in its new format which limits national 
advertising to two pages and eliminates local and classified ads 
in addition the staff of 160 people are among the 800 members of 
the publishing society and broadcasting operation due for cutbacks 
of 20 percent to 25 percent said don feldheim spokesman for 
publishing society supporting the newspaper reportedly has cost the 
church 20 million a year 
mrs fanning who became the first woman editor of the monitor in 
1983 resigned along with her managing editor and assistant managing 
editor in november 
she said she left rather than see the newspaper reduced in size 
while also losing independence under a restructured management that 
concentrated more on the churchs broadcasting arm

leaders of wisconsins smallest chippewa 
band have recommended that tribal members approve the states 
proposed 10 million settlement to limit the bands hunting and 
fishing treaty rights 
the chippewas exercise of treaty rights has been a source of 
controversy and protest by sportsfishermen and other outdoorsmen who 
argue it is unfair for indians to use methods or seasons prohibited 
others and that the exercise of the courtupheld foodgathering 
rights may harm or deplete natural resources 
earl a charlton an attorney representing the sokaogon chippewa 
said the tribal council unanimously adopted the final draft of an 
agreement with the state justice department and recommended it for 
approval by the community 
a meeting is scheduled tuesday night to introduce the settlement 
and a jan 14 referendum has been set said council member charles 
ackley 
if the agreement is ratified it must be approved by the 
legislature and signed by gov tommy g thompson by feb 15 
charlton said 
he said the agreement calls for payments of 1 million each year 
for 10 years and that 75 percent of the money is to go toward 
economic development and the rest is to pay for health and social 
programs 
the sokaogon band would have to give up some rights including 
spearfishing outside of that for ceremonial purposes the band would 
be limited to 100 fish speared per year he said 
the band also would forfeit its right to harvest timber on public 
land except for firewood he said the agreement could be extended 
for an additional 15 years at the option of both parties 
assistant attorney general stephen nicks who drafted the 
agreement refused to say over the weekend whether offers similar to 
that prepared for the sokaogon band have been drawn up for five 
other chippewa bands in northern wisconsin 
state and tribal lawyers have negotiated for months in an attempt 
to reach an agreement over the chippewas offreservation claims to 
natural resources guaranteed by 19thcentury federal treaties 
the tribes insistence on using spears to catch game fish a 
technique ordinarily forbidden by the state department of natural 
resources has been a volatile subject between tribal 
traditionalists and treaty critics 
justice department spokesman frank ryan said he could not comment 
whether similar deals were under consideration by other bands 
the sokaogon is believed to be the smallest chippewa band in 
wisconsin with about 1300 members at mole lake charlton said

ranasinghe premadasa was sworn in as 
president monday in a buddhist ceremony at the temple of the tooth 
and he again appealed for an end to the ethnic violence that has 
devastated the tropical island 
further delay in finding a solution will enable certain 
elements to destroy many more innocent lives this destruction must 
end because democracy cannot tolerate it premadasa said in his 
inaugural address 
premadasa 64 took the oaths of office and secrecy before chief 
justice parinda ranaginshe during a twohour ceremony in this 
picturesque hill town 85 miles east of colombo the capital 
heavily armed soldiers surrounded the sacred temple of the tooth 
where more than 500000 people gathered to watch the ceremony 
police sharpshooters were perched on surrounding roofs and troop on 
the ground checked all those entering the city 
premadasa won a sixyear term by defeating two opponents in the 
dec 19 presidential election he polled 504 percent of the vote 
although only 55 percent of the 93 million eligible voters cast 
ballots 
he succeeds his mentor junius r jayewaredene as president 
after serving as his prime minister for 11 years the president 
wields supreme power in sri lanka 
premadasa assumes the task of ruling a nation reeling from five 
years of strife between the predominantly buddhist sinhalese and the 
hindu tamils 
nearly 10000 people have died since 1983 when tamil militants 
began fighting for independence from the majority sinhalese the 
fighting also has left the national economy in shambles ruining the 
islands crucial tourism industry and reducing agricultural 
production 
premadasa also faces an uneasy relationship with regional 
superpower india which sent an estimated 47000 peacekeeping troops 
to sri lanka 18 months ago to disarm the rebels and enforce a 
ceasefire 
the insurgency has yet to be quelled however and premadasa said 
he wants the unpopular indian soldiers to leave 
on sunday the indian government announced it would start 
withdrawing its troops this week at premadasas request between 
2000 and 3000 soldiers are expected to leave within days 
the remaining troops will be gradually pulled out the government 
said but gave no timetable 
speaking from the octagonal central courtyard of the ancient 
buddhist shrine premadasa in his inaugural speech vowed he would 
not allow a single inch of sri lankan soil to be occupied by any 
foreign country again 
let us settle our problems by ourselves through negotiations 
and mutual respect we should not create situations that provoke or 
invite foreign intervention he said 
unlike most of sri lankas ruling elite premadasa was born in 
the slums of colombo 
during his campaign he frequently said he was the only candidate 
who could champion the poor in this country where the per capital 
annual income of 360 
premadasa joined the united national party in 1956 and entered 
parliament four years later when the party returned to power in 
1977 he became jayewardenes prime minister 
he remained at that post throughout jayewardenes term although 
the two men had some policy differences most prominently over the 
indiansponsored accord aimed at ending the tamil rebellion 
the pact signed on july 29 1987 offered limited autonomy to 
tamil community in the north and east provinces and invited india to 
send peacekeeping soldiers to combat the rebels who still demand 
independence 
jayewardene signed the accord premadasa opposes it 
tamils comprise 18 percent of the islands 16 million people 
they claim they are denied jobs and education by the sinhalese who 
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government 
the biggest and most militant tamil rebel group the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam rejected the accord saying it did not meet 
enought of their demands for selfrule 
a radical sinhalese group the peoples liberation front also 
denounced the pact claiming it granted too many concessions to the 
tamil community the front has been blamed for more than 900 murders 
since the accord was signed most victims have been government 
supporters 
during the campaign premadasa took pains not to blame sinhalese 
extremists for escalating violence he has yet to say how he will 
deal with the radicals but pledged to provide security to any 
member of extremists groups 
i call upon those who have not joined the democratic process to 
do so he said i am available at any time anywhere to discuss 
any problem

ceasefire proclaimed by the sovietbacked regime but rejected by 
the moslem guerrillas 
two insurgent leaders criticized the soviet union for considering 
a role in a future afghan government for former king zahir shah who 
was overthrown in 1973 and lives in italy 
iran said yuri vorontsov the soviet deputy foreign minister 
arrived in tehran for talks with afghan insurgent leaders based in 
iran he met in saudi arabia last month with burhanuddin rabbani 
leader of a sevenfaction alliance based in pakistan 
at least 55 million afghans have fled their country during a 
decade of civil war nearly all of them to pakistan or iran moslem 
nations that are afghanistans neighbors on the east and west

demanded an islamic government after the soviets leave and are 
trying to overthrow the regime of president najib 
najib announced the ceasefire friday effective new years day 
and said government forces would not fire unless fired upon 
insurgent leaders believe najibs government will fall when the 
soviets are gone and rejected the truce because they said it would 
be a disadvantage to them at this stage

insurgents attacked kandahar in the southeast killing three 
civilians and wounding six

who also is moscows ambassador to kabul met with zahir shah in 
rome on dec 24 
zahir shah will certainly not feel safe in the revolutionary 
afghanistan rabbani said at a news conference and hekmatyar 
declared the king has no place in todays afghanistan 
the afghan people will strongly resist any move against 
formation of an islamic government in kabul hekmatyar said

ptl founders jim and tammy faye bakker 
returned to the television pulpit monday for the first time in two 
years with an appeal for hurting people to keep the faith but 
no direct pleas for donations 
if jim and tammy can survive their holocaust of the last two 
years then you can make it said bakker who left ptl in march 
1987 amid a sexandmoney scandal 
the jim and tammy show originated in the living room of the 
bakkers borrowed home in this charlotte suburb they said it was 
sent by satellite to a halfdozen stations in california ohio new 
york pennsylvania and louisiana with the couples new ministry 
paying for air time 
the hourlong telecast is scheduled mondays through fridays 
we bought time said mrs bakker we had a certain amount 
of money and thats all the time we could buy and its not a lot of 
money but it got us back on the air and we are so grateful 
in their prime at ptl the bakkers and their ptl club could 
be seen on about 180 television stations 
as in their old show the bakkers sat on a couch mrs bakker 
wore her trademark heavy eye makeup and broke into tears several 
times the first just two minutes into their show 
the couple made no direct appeal for funds but gave an address 
and telephone number so viewers could request prayers 
and the shows guest former ptl songwriter mike murdock gave 
mrs bakker a card which he said he had been asked to deliver by a 
supporter mrs bakker said the card contained a 1000 check 
john bland a volunteer at jim and tammy ministries said 
mondays show drew a beautiful response 
a lot of people called in who said they were partners 
supporters who gave 1000 or more to ptl and glad to see that 
they were back on tv bland said 
the bakkers last appearance as television evangelists was in 
january 1987 two months before the scandal that drove them from 
ptl they had left the air because mrs bakker was receiving 
treatment for dependency on prescription drugs and for pneumonia 
the couple said at the time 
jim i think this is probably the happiest day of my life 
mrs bakker said as the show began 
bakker told viewers that his last television appearance was to 
break ground for the crystal palace church at heritage usa the home 
of ptl 
i believe that was the last straw for satan bakker said i 
think the devil was mad that something so beautiful was being built 
i believe the devil said i have to smash jim and tammy 
bakker 
bakker resigned from ptl following disclosure of his 1980 sexual 
encounter with a church secretary jessica hahn and that she had 
been paid for her silence 
in june 1987 the ministry sought protection from creditors in 
bankruptcy court and last month a judge approved the sale of ptls 
chief asset the heritage usa theme park at fort mill sc 
also last month bakker and a top aide were indicted on charges 
they used ptl funds for private gain 
but the only mention of his legal troubles during the show came 
when murdock noted a song he said he wrote in a lawyers office 
murdock said he knew bakker didnt know anything about lawyers 
oh noooo bakker said with a pained chuckle 
fred wuenschel general manager wocd in amsterdam ny one of 
the stations broadcasting the program said he would show it as 
long as they keep paying 
he said the station has a 30day contract for the show but 
declined to say how much the bakkers are paying except to say it was 
the usual rate per hour

for just 300 police have added 40 
recruits to patrol the streets of this northern kentucky city they 
dont make arrests but they will drive people to jail for a fee 
the recruits are the drivers of deluxe yellow cabs inc who 
have enlisted in a 2weekold program to give police more eyes and 
ears in the streets 
this is an excellent opportunity for us to take advantage of 
the fact that cab drivers operate 24 hours a day seven days a week 
on the same streets that we patrol said sgt bill dorsey a 
police administrative supervisor 
under the new program taxis on patrol cab drivers report 
suspicious activity to dispatchers over twoway radios the 
dispatchers then notify police 
you name it and we see it said cab driver bob sterling we 
stop fights rapes and all of those things 
still authorities say they dont want cab drivers to stop 
crimes just to tell police about them 
were not asking them to do police work or to get involved 
said city commissioner butch callery theyre strictly to call an 
event in and alert us to the situation 
callery proposed the taxi program after reading about similar 
efforts elsewhere itll never take the place of more policemen 
but it will assist us the commissioner said 
the 300 startup cost of the program covered a 2hour training 
program for drivers and the printing of decals affixed to the taxis 
authorities in nashville tenn tried a similar system in 1983 
but gave up after cab drivers lost interest said walter lawhorn an 
inspector for the nashvilledavidson county metropolitan taxicab 
board 
assistant city manager gregory jarvis said the covington program 
hasnt been in effect long enough to determine its impact but he 
said it certainly cant hurt

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
slowly may be winning converts to his policy of glasnost or 
openness but whether the word merits inclusion in a us dictionary 
remains under debate 
the honor likely to be accorded such allamerican terms as 
televangelist and computer virus in upcoming merriamwebster 
dictionaries has so far been denied the word describing gorbachevs 
reforms 
it is still most often found in either italics or quotes and to 
us that means it has not been completely americanized said james 
g lowe senior editor at springfieldbased gc merriam inc when 
reporters and writers start using it without explaining what it 
means it will be ready for consideration for the dictionary 
the term computer virus came into wide use too late for this 
years book but it is an almost sure bet for inclusion in the next 
addendum to the companys unabridged dictionary lowe said thanks 
to a graduate student who this autumn unleashed a virus that 
clogged university and military computers and exposed the 
vulnerability of computer banks to infection 
televangelist colorization as used to describe the 
tinting of old blackandwhite films and zap when used to 
describe what happens to a television commercial when a viewer 
switches to another channel by remote control are also likely 
candidates for the unabridged dictionary he said

school

school systems but it was back to the books for students in public 
schools here 
i dont want to go said joe alexander 14 as he boarded a 
school bus bound for attucks junior high its not fair for us to 
go on a federal holiday 
a lot of students and parents apparently had the same 
opinion as the absentee rate shot up to near 40 percent at some 
schools overall attendance was termed fair by officials 
frank tout principal at howe high school estimated that between 
60 percent and 65 percent of the schools 1609 students were in 
class 
although christmas vacation started earlier at city schools than 
at other school systems another day off would have been nice most 
students agreed 
i dont like it said jesse harper 12 another attucks 
student my dad is staying home today and i wanted to stay with 
him 
but some were more than ready to return 
i wanted to go to school today said missy frazier 14 an

sudans prime minister told trade union 
leaders monday the economy still needs price increases but his 
listeners hinted that imposing them might lead to a recurrence of 
violent strikes 
steep price increases announced dec 26 led to demonstrations and 
a general strike four people died and scores were injured before 
union leaders called off the protests saturday two days after the 
government rescinded the price increases 
on monday more than 500 leaders of trade and professional 
organizations met with prime minister sadek mahdi to discuss the 
impact of the violence and the governments failure to endorse an 
initiative to end civil war in southern sudan 
in addition to the rollback on prices the government gave in to 
a demand by the sudanese workers trade union federation to make 
salary increases of up to 500 percent retroactive to july 1 instead 
of dec 1 as the government had ordered 
while mahdi conceded the price increases may have been too high 
as much as 600 percent for sugar he said prices on some items had 
to be raised he promised to stay away from important foods 
however and said subsidies on sorghum the sudanese staple and 
medicines wouldnt be touched 
there are other possibilities and other more reasonable price 
increases that i dont want to go into now mahdi said 
he said the price of sugar extremely important in the sudanese 
culture must be increased to cover its production costs and to 
prevent smuggling into neighboring countries 
any steps must not affect the workers and struggling people and 
add to their burdens said abdelwahab sinada representative of 
the professional associations we reject any increase in prices 
we are ready for civil disobedience and general strikes 
professional groups carry considerable weight in sudan and played 
a decisive role in the 1985 military coup that ousted the 
authoritarian prowestern president gaafar nimeiri tradesmen and 
students were the major forces behind last weeks disturbances 
western observers fear the trade and professional unions might 
join forces with the democratic unionist party still angered over 
mahdis handling of the peace agreement it reached a month and a 
half ago with the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
during the strike the unionists resigned from the coalition 
cabinet headed by the umma party in sympathy with the demonstrators 
and outrage over the prime ministers stand on the peace agreement 
mahdi apparently refused to officially endorse the agreement 
because of a clause advocating suspension of the 1400yearold 
islamic legal code which was sure to anger the fundamentalist 
national islamic front the thirdlargest cabinet partner and 
mahdis buffer against his traditional opponents the democratic 
unionists 
publicly mahdi says he objects to the pacts clauses eliminating 
defense treaties with other countries and ending emergency rule 
which has been nimeiris overthrow in 1985 
the unions have been demanding immediate implementation of the 
peace plan and a ceasefire in the 5yearold civil war on ground 
it would save the country 275 million a year sudans foreign debt 
is 14 billion and khartoum owes more than 900 million in interest 
it cant pay 
it is slowly but surely building up into another explosive 
situation a western political observer said on condition of 
anonymity 
the democratic unionist party is gathering forces with the 
southern and communist parties and the trade and professional 
unions calling for implementing the peace initiative this will 
sooner or later spill into the streets in demonstrations and this 
could be ugly 
john garang leader of the sudan peoples liberation army called 
for mahdis resignation in a new years day radio broadcast from 
addis ababa ethiopia he suggested direct peace talks with sudanese 
army generals especially those fighting in the south 
defending his views on the agreement mahdi told union leaders 
we do not disagree on the peace issue but there are specific 
points in the initiative that have to be resolved 
he agreed to form a committee with the union leaders to discuss 
possible solutions to the civil war and the economic situation

each accuses the other of starting the latest battle their most 
intense since november when 40 people were killed and 87 were 
wounded during six days of fighting in west and south beirut

and bomb shelters since new years eve in the shiyah ghobeiri 
haret hreik and mesharafiyeh slum districts

deployment of 4500 soldiers in the slums to improve their 
performance and prevent further fighting

between amal and hezbollah since four days in april in which 62 were 
killed and 150 wounded

rockets against each others strongholds in iklim eltuffah the 
apple province whose orchards have fallen victim to 13 years of 
sectarian and factional war 
the region runs from sidon to the border security zone israel 
established in 1985 when it withdrew most of its troops from lebanon 
after three years of invasion and ocupation 
an amal statement said its fighters drove hezbollah militiamen 
from jbaa jarjou arabsalim and ein biswar villages with a 
twopronged dawn offensive 
one from hezbollah communique said the assault was repulsed 
with gods help in two hours of heavy fighting but amal then 
clamped a siege on the area preventing food and water supplies 
from moving in 
it said hezbollah fighters in the area belonged to the islamic 
resistance front a coalition of fundamentalist factions that raids 
the security zone which is defended by israeli soldiers and and 
their predominantly christian surrogate militia

the truthtellers of the nation have 
spoken out in a new book by and about teenagers and their views and 
hopes 
id like to be able to walk down american streets at midnight 
with the same ease id walk down the street at noon one 
teenager tobdeleya dumas of cleveland said in voices of hope 
jana reiss of galesburg ill reflected on the maturation 
process 
as people grow older they begin to see things in shades of 
gray and not in simple black and white as they did as children 
she was quoted in the book as saying when i was a child my 
dreams were simple and selfish now i hope for feelings not things 
i dream more for my friends and family and less for myself 
american teenagers are incredibly idealistic and want to 
help solve societys problems but often are frustrated because they 
think they lack the means to make a difference said greg jao an 
editor of the book 
they honestly want to be able to talk to their parents and be 
involved in politics but theyre also very cynical because they 
dont feel any real change can come from their efforts said jao 
20 
voices of hope follows teenagers themselves and voices 
of conflict a series researched by the staff of the student 
newspaper at glenbard east high school in this western chicago 
suburb 
staff members of the echo newspaper traveled to 35 cities 
interviewed 2000 students and collected questionnaires from 5000 
more in all 50 states under the direction of journalism teacher and 
newspaper adviser howard spanogle 
teenagers are unique because they are the truth tellers of the 
nation spanogle said 
students interviewed ages 14 through 19 ranged from the 
wildly hedonistic stereotype of the inner cities to the deeply 
religious of more rural areas jao said 
as opposed to statistical studies weve tried for much more 
of a qualitative approach said jao now an english student at the 
university of chicago 
students want an end to all forms of discrimination against 
them as young people and against minorities spanogle said 
they seek communication between generations equal treatment 
for teenagers openness to all viewpoints and awareness of social 
problems said spanogle who has been advising the newspaper for 
21 years 
researchers also interviewed adults such as us sen paul simon 
dill for perspectives on issues that most concern teenagers 
nobel prizewinner leon lederman director of fermi national 
accelerator laboratory near batavia ill asserts that science 
education in the united states is bloody awful and doug wood 
director of youth ministries at dallas first baptist church 
suggests ways the church can elevate the moral fiber of young people 
sean mix of seattle said of teenage drinking teen views and 
adult views dont really differ when it comes to handling 
pressure because we handle it about the same way our parents 
drink and so do we 
megan mckinney of abilene texas talked about morals 
in order to know what is right or wrong consult the bible 
unfortunately in an increasingly immoral society people succumb to 
their natural urges rather than overcome them she said 
one reason i believed sex should only happen within the 
marriage vows came from the examply my parents supposedly set 
said a south carolina girl who was not identified by name when i 
found out a year ago that my parents were married in 69 instread of 
68 making me a child conceived out of wedlock i was shocked and 
confused 
the ideal family was on the mind of kimberly aretta of uniontown 
pa 
the perfect family would be one that is always there for you 
even if youre wrong one that understands the feelings of a 
teenager and realizes we will make plenty of mistakes she said 
jao said the book is a challenge to america to find ways for 
teenagers to channel their hopes and enthusiasm 
teens are incredibly idealistic he said theres a real 
frustration people perceive as apathy that they dont know how to 
channel that energy we need to find ways to channel that incredible 
idealism 
the book and the two others in the series were published by adama 
books of new york and is available at major bookstores nationwide

nickbarge 89yearold frank tear sr and thomas shared a 9foot

about 250 armsmaking plants will be restructured 
and included in a plan to produce machinery for growing and 
processing food the official news agency tass reported monday 
a special program has been drawn up for the coming eight years 
that provides for the creation and mastering of the batch production 
of highly efficient equipment tass said in a dispatch based on an 
interview with deputy premier igor belousov 
it said the new equipment was intended for smaller leasecontract 
farming operations as well as collective and state farms 
huge quantities of food are lost in transportation and storage in 
the highly centralized soviet economy 
president mikhail s gorbachev is promoting smaller farming 
operations involved with specific tasks or parcels of land to 
encourage farmers to work harder and produce more 
tass said research and design work on farming and processing 
machinery would increase sevenfold 
some 250 armsmanufacturing plants have been drawn into this 
work it quoted belousov as saying some industrial enterprises 
of this arms industry that were planned are being switched to 
peaceful production 
he said soviet defense policies should lead to arms production at 
a lower level still sufficient to defend the the soviet union and 
its allies according to the tass report 
gorbachev has recommended diverting some resources from the 
military to production of consumer goods he says the soviet union 
needs an easing of world tensions so more time and resources can be 
devoted to solving internal problems

libyas official news agency said monday that the 
united states is using allegations about a chemical weapons plant as 
a pretext to attack the radical north african arab nation and kill 
its leader col moammar gadhafi 
in west germany bonn government officials announced they were 
examining the records of imhausenchemie of lahr a company said to 
be involved in the purported plant 
but no criminal investigation has begun into the activities of 
the company local prosecutor werner botz said 
imhausenchemie director juergen hippenstielimhausen rejected 
the accusations in an interview with south german radio in stuttgart 
that was broadcast late monday he said he hoped the government 
probe would clear his firm of any wrongdoing 
libyas jana agency monitored in rome noted that a report 
sunday in a united arab emirates newspaper quoted unidentified arab 
sources as saying america planned to send an assassination team to 
kill gadhafi during an attack on libya 
the daily alkhaleej said a us task force trained for the 
attack is in italy spain and aboard us warships in the 
mediterranean and said it could come this month it said the strike 
would include air raids on a libyan nuclear research center at 
tajura and the purported chemical weapons plant at rabtah 
jana said on monday that a group it called the international 
league in defense of the mediterranean condemned the sailing of a 
new us 13ship carrier battle group for the mediterranean 
a us navy spokesman in washington called the sailing a routine 
deployment of the 6th fleet a navy spokesman in italy said the new 
group comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in the 
mediterranean 
the state department in washington said monday it had no officer 
on duty to answer questions 
the report by alkhaleej report carried no dateline but appeared 
to originate in tripoli the libyan capital 
jana said the uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals and 
exposes clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hysterical 
campaign the us government has mounted against libya 
it said the report proves us allegations about a chemical arms 
plant were excuses and pretexts for an operation of premeditated 
individual murder 
washington says libya is about to produce chemical weapons at the 
plant near rabtah about 50 miles southwest of tripoli libya says 
the plant makes pharmaceuticals and stresses libyas commitment to 
treaties banning chemical weapons 
president reagan has said the united states discussed with other 
north atlantic treaty organization nations the possibility of 
military action against the plant 
in bonn federal government spokesman norbert schaefer told a 
news conference authorities had no indication or evidence to 
verify the american suspicions that west german industry was 
involved 
he said the allegations were brought to the governments 
attention during chancellor helmut kohls visit to washington in 
november but bonn had no concrete information to work with 
we must guarantee that german companies do not make profits 
from the construction of death factories in third world countries 
helmut ohnewald a christian democratic state legislator from 
badenwuerttemberg told reporters 
the christian democratic union in badenwuerttemberg where 
imhausenchemie is located issued a statement demanding a full 
probe into the allegations 
the companys hippenstielimhausen said imhausenchemie had 
nothing to do with the libyan factory but had business contacts 
in libya relating to provision of materials for a plant to produce 
plastic bags 
finance ministry spokesman karlheinz von den driesch confirmed 
that a foreign trade investigation was launched friday as a 
precautionary measure once bonn learned that the name of the 
german firm implicated by the united states was to be made public 
he said no evidence was uncovered to suggest imhausenchemie was 
involved in wrongdoing 
von den driesch said the investigation would try to find whether 
materials could have been shipped to libya indirectly through a 
third country 
companies from west germany japan and italy are believed to have 
helped libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex 
according to news reports in the united states japan told the 
united states its citizens believed they were involved in building a 
fertilizer plant 
at least two west german firms provided libya with chemicals 
technical assistance and special pumps and piping for the plant 
us news amp world report magazine said in a report released sunday 
one company was identified as imhausenchemie the new york times 
said sunday quoting us government officials

west bank lawyers said monday they would boycott 
military courts for one month to protest what they called a complete 
lack of due process for palestinian detainees 
the announcement coincided with the demolition of two homes in 
the occupied west bank and came a day after the deportation of 13 
palestinians fueling new charges of human rights violations by 
israel 
in the west bank and gaza strip at least 10 palestinians were 
wounded monday in scattered clashes between troops and 
stonethrowing youths arab hospital officials said the army said 
it was checking the reports 
the wounded included two girls aged 12 and 14 reported in 
critical condition after being shot in the head during a clash at 
gazas bureij refugee camp arab doctors said 
an army patrol came under a shooting attack near dahiriya in the 
west bank but no injuries resulted the army surrounded the village 
and conducted searches israel radio said 
in gaza city palestinians staged a spontaneous strike to protest 
sundays deporations six of the deportees were from gaza 
an army official denied the lawyers allegations and defended 
israeli actions to quell the nearly 13month palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation 
we believe we have a liberal judicial system in the 
territories but we should not be judged in the same context as 
western countries that are not in a state of war said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
deportations and house demolitions are among our tools for 
maintaining control he said the united states and other western 
nations have condemned such practices saying they violate 
international human rights conventions 
at a news conference palestinian lawyer bahij tamini said his 
clients were being denied their rights at every step in the military 
legal system as part of a strategy to crush the uprising known by 
the arabic word intefadeh 
the boycott is a cry of protest one last attempt to get 
through to the authorities tamini said 
he said attorneys face difficulties in locating clients 
attorneys frequently are barred from meeting with their clients 
bail requests are routinely denied and trial dates are often not 
coordinated with attorneys 
we feel handcuffed and chained ourselves said tamini 
added colleague jonathan kuttab lawyers should be allowed to 
be lawyers instead of being collaborators in a system that pretends 
to be legal but isnt 
palestinian lawyers in the gaza strip have been boycotting 
military courts for a year to protest similar conditions 
felicia langer an israeli lawyer who represents palestinian 
clients said she feared deportations and other strict measures 
would increase under the government formed last month by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
the army official sharply denied the lawyers allegations 
he said that earlier the sheer numbers caused delays in helping 
lawyers to find clients but now the army has set up a special 
office to help lawyers find their clients 
attorneys are not barred from seeing clients trial dates are 
coordinated with lawyers and bail has been granted in hundreds of 
cases he said 
in middecember 5542 palestinians were in detention including 
2370 awaiting charges 1380 awaiting trial 442 convicted and 
1350 held without charges for up to six months in socalled 
adminstrative detention the army said 
the west bank lawyers estimated that since the beginning of the 
uprising nearly 40000 palestinians have been jailed at one time or 
another 
in addition to the detentions 49 palestinians have been deported 
since the beginning of the uprising compared with 43 in the 
threeyear period from january 1985 to november 1987 
since the uprising the army has demolished or sealed 151 houses 
in the west bank including two bulldozed monday in the balata 
refugee camp according to the palestinian human rights group law in 
the service man thirtyeight houses also were reported torn down or 
sealed in the gaza strip 
the army official said deportations were carried out selectively 
and only as a last resort 
houses usually are torn down before the owners are convicted of 
any crime

portauprince haiti ap the former mayor of portauprince 
blamed for the church massacre of 12 people has fled haiti after 
receiving a safeconduct pass from the military government 
franck romain left portauprince on saturday after spending 
three months in the dominican embassy the information ministry 
said he was given political asylum in the embassy after the sept 
17 military coup that brought lt gen prosper avril to power 
the ministry statement issued sunday did not say where romain 
had gone but he was believed to be in the dominican republic which 
shares the island of hispaniola with haiti he was given an official 
pass assuring his safe departure at the request of the dominican 
government the ministry said 
in the dominican republic the daily newspaper el nacional 
reported monday that romain was in the country on sunday 
the newspaper quoted sources in the dominican embassy in haiti as 
saying romain was taken to the border in an embassy automobile under 
military escort once at the border romain traveled to santo 
domingo where he is staying with friends the newspaper reported 
el nacional said romains wife and a son left the embassy two 
weeks earlier but it did not say whether they also traveled to the 
dominican republic 
jose del carmen acosta the dominican ambassador in haiti 
declined comment 
romain who has not been charged was accused of directing the 
sept 11 massacre at a roman catholic church in a portauprince 
slum attackers armed with guns machete knives and spikes killed 12 
people and wounded at least 70 others 
the information ministry said romains departure did not 
prejudice the legal proceedings against him but did not 
elaborate 
the former mayor was a reputed leader of the tonton macoutes the 
dreaded militia set up during the 29year duvalier dictatorship and 
perpetrators of the church massacre were identified as city hall 
employees 
the soldiers who overthrew lt gen henri namphy in september 
said they were provoked by the atrocity and wanted to end 
statesponsored violence 
namphy fled to the dominican republic and remains there with his 
wife and daughter 
in november the government announced it was investigating romain 
for unspecified crimes 
arnold antonin codirector of the national network for the 
defense of human rights said monday that romains departure would 
have an adverse effect on the human rights credibility of the 
haitian government 
franck romain was one of the big bosses of the paramilitary 
gangs in haiti antonin said the granting of a safeconduct 
pass is especially disturbing now that we all are expecting 
spectacular measures on the part of the government to eliminate 
these gangs from national life 
avril has pledged to purge the army of the tonton macoutes and 
carry out sweeping democratic reforms 
namphy led the military junta that assumed power when dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier fled to france in 1986 duvalier assumed the 
presidency in 1971 on the death of his father francois duvalier 
who was elected president in 1957

the soviet unions chief rabbi says the soviet 
antizionist committee has been dismantled and he hopes for better 
cooperation with jewish groups in the west a jewish organization 
said monday 
abraham shayevitch the chief rabbi made the announcement in a 
letter sent monday to the edgar bronfman chairman of the world 
jewish congress said avi beker executive director of the wjc in 
israel shayevitch is in israel for a twoweek visit 
american jewish leaders said in december they were told by letter 
that the committee which generated propaganda against israel would 
be dismantled by the end of the year 
the letter to prominent jewish leaders in new york purportedly 
was written by samuel zivs a soviet lawyer who helped found the 
committee in 1983 
beker said monday about the chief rabbis letter the 
significance is that from now on jewish organizations can have 
normal relations with the soviet rabbis and we can start working 
together toward building a normal communal life for jews in the 
soviet union 
he said in an interview the world jewish congress had boycotted 
shayevitch and other soviet rabbis before the letter was written 
the antizionist committee a governmentsponsored body included 
some wellknown jewish personalities in the soviet union and has 
been a source of embarrassment for jewish groups dealing with 
officials of soviet jewry 
it was intended to lend credibility to antiisraeli policies the 
soviet union followed until recently 
shayevitch said in the letter to bronfman according to beker 
in my meetings here i announced unequivocally that i am not a 
member of the antizionist committee and that the committee was 
dismantled furthermore i regret that such a committee existed 
in the past but i emphasize that i have never participated in 
actions against jews or the state of israel 
he said he understood this announcement could clear the way 
for working relationship with the wjc beker reported 
israeli jews have accused shayevitch of lacking interest in 
jewish culture he is appointed by the soviet government and 
presides over the grand synagogue in moscow 
he arrived in israel last tuesday with chaim levite chief rabbi 
of leningrad on the first trip to the holy land by soviet religious 
leaders since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 they are guests of 
the tel aviv religious council 
moscow broke diplomatic ties after the 1967 middle east war in 
which israel captured territory from the kremlins arab allies 
relations have improved recently and the governments have exchanged 
lowlevel diplomatic missions 
the soviets allowed 19300 jews to emigrate in 1988 and the 
december emigration figure reached a nineyear monthly high of 
3650 israels governmentsponsored public council for soviet jewry 
said monday

four leading members of the outlawed 
communist party were jailed monday and president augusto pinochets 
military government charged them with promoting political violence 
those ordered to jail by civilian judge domingo kockish of 
santiago were mireya baltra americo zorrilla jose sanfuentes and 
guillermo scherping ms baltra and zorrilla served in the elected 
government of the late president salvador allende an avowed marxist 
ousted by pinochet in a 1973 coup 
the communists and two other radical leftist groups were made 
illegal by the 1980 constitution which the military wrote the 
indictments and jailings coincided with the partys 67th anniversary 
as the defendants arrived at the court building monday other 
party members presented them with anniversary cakes they smiled and 
ate the cakes while court guards watched without intefering 
charges of promoting political violence stem from a document they 
issued dec 6th announcing the partys first national congress in 
two decades it document urged a popular rebellion and supported 
all forms of struggle including violence against the 
government 
party officials said the congress expected to last months began 
later in december at clandestine locations 
attorney general ambrosio rodriguez said the communist document 
violated the internal security law which makes promoting political 
violence a crime 
according to the indictments the party proclamation amounted to 
an apologia for political violence urging the overthrow of the 
goverment and the formation of armed popular militias 
carlos caceres the interior minister said action was taken 
against the communists to demonstrate the governments 
determination to have a peaceful transition to democracy 
sanfuentes one of the defendants said the government wants to 
prevent the communist partys presence in the countrys political

critics of a government austerity plan said 
monday some provisions could hurt the army by forcing cuts in 
weapons purchases or training programs 
ministers and legislators from both major political blocs accused 
finance minister shimon peres of not working out the details of his 
plan before announcing it sunday 
his proposals call for controlling inflation by curbing 
costofliving pay increases and cutting about 600 million from 
government spending on the army schools hospitals and welfare 
peres who leads the centerleft labor party said his inflation 
target was 9 percent by the end of 1989 about half of the current 
annual figure of 18 percent he did not say where spending cuts 
should be made leaving that to a ministerial committee expected to 
convene wednesday or thursday 
he began implementing the plan sunday by reducing subsidies for 
food and gasoline prices of milk bread and frozen chicken 
increased as much as 26 percent on sunday morning 
the government has devalued the shekel by 13 percent since last 
week as a first step toward reviving export industries hampered by a 
frozen exchange rate 
israeli news reports said the peres plan calls for reductions of 
up to 353 million in the military budget including 147 million 
allocated to army operations in the occupied territories where 
palestinians began a rebellion 13 months ago 
defense minister yitzhak rabin also of the labor party said the 
army might have to reduce training abandon a 10year development 
plan and slow equipment purchases 
this would seriously harm the armys ability and may destroy 
securityrelated industries in israel he said it does not look 
justified to me 
other planned cuts are said to include up to 118 million in the 
education budget which might force parents to pay tuition for 
kindergarten and high school the radio said 
deputy premier david levy of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
conservative likud bloc said price increases and reductions in 
spending on schools and welfare could negate a generation of 
progress and tear our society apart

president fidel castro said that cuba has an 
enormous responsibility to third world countries to stick to its 
present hardline marxistleninist course and he spurned 
marketoriented economic reforms 
today we say with more force than ever socialism or death 
marxism leninism or death he said 
his onehourand54minute televised speech sunday night 
celebrating the 30th anniversary of his revolution was devoted 
mainly to praising the people of santiago and other eastern cuban 
cities for their revoutionary heritage and support it is the area 
castro calls the cradle of the revolution 
it was only toward the end of his address that castro made 
remarks appearently directed toward the soviet union and other 
communist lands that have been veering from rigid adherence to 
marxist doctrine 
he did not refer directly to the soviet union or to the economic 
and political reforms now being pushed by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev saying only that confusion marked the contemporary 
situation 
castro was more explicit about rejecting gorbachevs reform 
policies in earlier speeches 
he acknowledged then that changes being attempted under gorbachev 
could cause difficulties for cuba and also said that cuba will 
never embrace any reforms that reek of capitalism 
castro addressed a large gathering on sunday night from the 
balcony of the municipal building in santiago where three decades 
before on jan 1 1959 he proclaimed victory for his revolutionary 
struggle 
the president called the revolution a beacon of light before 
the eyes of the world 
cuban officials said castro is expected to deliver a policy 
address on wednesday 
the friendship between havana and moscow seems more tenuous now 
than it has been for years although it is far from rupture 
the soviets have chafed about the way cuba has used the estimated 
5 billion a year it receives in soviet economic aid and the 
question has arisen whether this will lead to cutbacks moscow 
thinks castro has neglected industrial development to spend the 
money instead on schools and hospitals 
despite castros remarks on sunday the president now seems more 
interested in pursuing normal ties with elected governments than in 
efforts to promote violent revolution as he once did 
cubas recent commitment to withdraw its 50000 troops from 
angola by 1991 is one sign of dramatic policy change 
he said while attending the presidential inaguration in mexico in 
november that he envisions the eventual unity of cuba and the rest 
of latin america

nicaraguan rebel leaders on monday 
told costa rican president oscar arias they are willing to attend 
peace talks in washington with the leftist nicaraguan government 
we have the honor of confirming to you mr president our 
willingness to reach a political solution to the conflict and that 
we have decided to accept washington as the city where negotiations 
with the sandinista government should continue the leadership of 
the nicaraguan resistance the rebels political organization told 
arias in a letter 
arias is the author of a 1987 peace plan for central america that 
calls in part for negotiated solutions to civil conflicts in 
nicaragua el salvador and guatemala 
a tenuous ceasefire agreement between the usbacked nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras and the leftist sandinistas has been in 
effect since march negotiations on a permanent end to the 
sevenyearold civil war broke down in september 
the sandinistas suggested in september that future talks take 
place either in managua the nicaraguan capital or in washington 
the reagan administration has trained funded and supplied the 
rebels since 1981 in their war to overthrow the sandinistas 
the contras proposed in their letter on monday that negotiations 
with the sandinista government begin jan 25 at the washington 
headquarters of the organization of american states 
the proposed that oas secretarygeneral joao baena suares roman 
catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo of managua and the foreign 
ministers of the five central american governments act as witnesses 
to the talks 
the resistance leaders said they were willing to call an end to 
rebel military operations in exchange for democratic reforms by the 
sandinistas they also called for effective measures by a 
verification commission to monitor sandinista compliance with the 
peace plan which provides for democratic guarantees 
we consider it urgent that viable mechanisms be established to 
guarantee the independence of the peace plan verification 
commission said the letter signed by resistance directors adolfo 
calero enrique bermudez roberto ferrey and wilfredo montalvan 
the rebel message came after honduran president jose azcona hoyo 
confirmed he plans to attend a summit of central american presidents 
scheduled for jan 1516 in san salvador capital of el salvador to 
advance the stalled peace plan 
the summit had been threatened by nicaraguan claims that 
honduras a key us ally has been harboring and supporting the 
contras most contra fighters fled to honduras after us military 
aid expired in february 
the international court of justice at the hague netherlands 
agreed last month to hear a formal nicaraguan complaint against 
honduras over the rebels presence in that country 
the world court decision prompted azcona hoyo to threaten to 
boycott the summit unless nicaragua dropped its case honduras would 
also boycott a preparatory meeting of central american foreign 
ministers in managua if nicaragua didnt withdraw its complaint he 
said 
in addition azcona hoyo threatened to file a countersuit against 
nicaragua before the world court charging sandinista army troops 
with repeated incursions into honduran territory 
but azcona hoyo confirmed he would attend the summit during a 
nationally broadcast new years message on saturday

remainder of the supplies next week 
twelve private relief planes have departed from other cities 
said dikran kaligian executive director of the armenian national 
committee but two weeks ago before transport could be arranged 
from logan the soviets called a temporary halt to shipments to 
armenia in order to take stock of which supplies were needed and 
where he said 
armenian church and relief officials in the united states 
meanwhile have been reluctant to airlift cargo without sending 
their own people along to ensure the supplies reach the quake 
victims for whom they are intended kaligian said 
kaligian said he knows of no relief supplies that have gone 
astray but the armenians are taking no chances 
they could divert it to moscow they could take everything 
he said weve had our personnel on board 
the cargo plane and crew were provided by pan aviation based in 
miami and owned by armenianamericans medical outreach paid for 
fuel and operating costs nazarian said 
the plane loaded with bales of blankets food tents and medical 
supplies ranging from antacids to antibiotics left logan at about 
410 pm the schedule for the 14hour trip to the armenian capital 
of yerevan included a stop at shannon ireland officials said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass gov michael s dukakis and his 
wife kitty boston mayor raymond l flynn and state house speaker 
george keverian were at the airport at noon for a news conference on 
the planes departure 
dukakis said the supplies being stored in the hangar reflect 
the affection massachusetts residents have for the people of 
armenia 
the two physicians najarian and dr richard aghababian of the 
university of massachusetts at worcester said they wanted to set up 
a microbiology laboratory in armenia to help test for infectious 
diseases which can spread after disasters 
mrs dukakis promised to help raise the money for the laboratory 
if it turns out to be needed

a police chief said monday he will 
seek homicide charges against two cruise operators and two port 
guards in the capsizesinking of a tourist boat that drowned at 
least 51 people on new years eve 
also monday the navy released a report saying that the vessel 
was inspected twice on the week it sank including on the day of the 
sinking the report conflicted with statements by witnesses who said 
no attempt was made to control the number of people who boarded the 
doubledeck excursion vessel bateau mouche and that few life 
jackets were available 
widely conflicting reports emerged about how many people were on 
the 100footlong boat when it sank and how many may still be 
missing 
the navy said its inspectors examined the boat on wednesday 
finding satisfactory safety and navigational conditions and a 
number of life jackets above what was necessary 
a patrol boat intercepted the vessel at 930 pm saturday just 
over two hours before it capsized and navy inspectors found 149 
people aboard within a permitted capacity of 153 the 
statement said 
the vessel therefore was given clearance the navy declared 
and its port authority for rio had a perfectly clear conscience of 
duty carried out 
rumors of bribes or negligence involving men from the patrol 
boat who made the last inspection will be investigated it said 
police chief irineu barroso of rios 10th precinct who is in 
charge of the case said monday he will seek criminal charges 
against the owner of itatiaia turismo the rio travel agency that 
booked the cruise the owner of the sol e mar restaurant that 
operates the vessel and two port authority guards who stopped the 
boat but allowed it to go on its way barroso said he will also seek 
charges of corruption and accepting bribes against the guards 
no one has been arrested in the case 
survivors are telling us that something on board was not 
right he had said sunday 
barroso said the bateau mouche was overcrowded and questioned why 
it resumed its trip after the patrol boat turned it back to the dock 
for inspection saturday 
a representative of the booking agent said the bateau mouche 
usually carried only 100 passengers tickets for the new years eve 
cruise to watch midnight fireworks off copacabana beach cost 220 
each 
on monday the boat remained under 65 feet of water off sugar 
loaf mountain a rio landmark near downtown 
rescuers said they may find more bodies but that most of the 
people who drowned probably were accounted for 
we think that most of the bodies already have been taken out 
said lt pedro paulo albuquerque of the fire department maritime 
division whose divers were inspecting the wreck he added however 
that we may see some bodies washing up on rios beaches in the 
next couple of days 
tv globo brazils largest commercial network carried reports of 
30 bodies trapped in the boats banquet room it did not give the 
source of the reports 
col jefferson cardoso de bem head of the fire department 
maritime division said in response our divers still do not have 
sufficient visibility to see whats inside the room there are 
piles of tables and chairs in the way the work is going very 
slowly 
survivors told journalists sunday no effort was made to control 
the number of people boarding they said few life jackets were 
available and life preservers were tied to the railing they 
confirmed the forced return for the passenger count and said the 
craft went back out a few minutes later 
cid castor of itatiaia turismo told the associated press 100 
tickets normally were sold for twicedaily sightseeing excursions on 
the bateau mouche 
confusion persisted about how many on the new years eve cruise 
were passengers crewmen waiters members of the samba band or 
others 
castor said itatiaias excursion director drowned in the sinking 
and the passenger list went down with him 
sergio rodrigues a lawyer for the sol e mar restaurant said an 
incomplete reservation list showed 106 passengers eight band 
members five waiters one head waiter the pilot and three crewmen 
gustavo blanco a spokesman for the sol e mar produced an 
incomplete list sunday with 131 names but said it did not include 
people accompanying those with reservations and we dont know how 
many were on board

the man who said he killed amazon 
ecologist francisco mendes will undergo a lie detector test to clear 
up contradictions in his statements about the shooting the justice 
ministry said monday 
deputy justice minister luis fernando eichenberg told the 
associated press that investigators have questions about the events 
that preceded the dec 22 shooting mendes was shot as he stepped 
from his home in the amazon jungle city of xapuri 2660 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
darcy alves pereira da silva 21 the son of a local cattle 
rancher said last tuesday he killed mendes the president of the 
local rubber tappers union mendes challenged local ranchers who 
wanted to clear amazon land for cattle grazing 
but eichenberg said if he pereira da silva did shoot mendes 
he didnt act alone the lie detector test can help us eliminate 
doubts 
police said earlier that pereira da silva might be acting as a 
cover for his father darly alves da silva who mendes had said 
threatened to kill him 
pereira da silva and his brother oloci 22 are being held in 
police custody but their father and their uncle alvarino alves da 
silva are in hiding possibly in bolivia according to press 
reports 
that the alves brothers may be hiding in bolivia is a 
hypothesis we are examining if confirmed we will begin extradition 
procedings eichenberg said 
mendes received the united nations global 500 award for his 
ecological work to preserve the amazon forest ecologists say an 
area the size of belgium is burned and chopped down each year in the 
jungle region that covers more than twothirds of brazilian 
territory 
ecologists say the reduction in tropical forest lands has 
contributed to the elevation of the earths temperature which may 
have been a factor in the devastating drought in the us midwest 
this past summer 
mendes death has drawn world attention to the old problem of 
land conflicts between landless peasant farmers and rightwing 
cattle ranchers 
since 1980 more than 1000 peasants ecologists and church 
leaders who defend the peasants have been killed in battles over 
land ownership in brazil

hall show airs tuesday its a personal best its me against 
me 
hall and sajak whose cbs show debuts monday may have an uphill 
battle establishing themselves in a field already glutted with 
flashy even bizarre personalities but their shows will have 
subtle differences from the current fare and each other 
sajak for instance will have a desk hall wont 
sajak who usually wears a pocket handkerchief on the wheel of 
fortune will abandon it at night said coordinating producer 
david williger hall will tend to stylish suits 
cbs spent more than 4 million to build a new sound stage and 
other facilities for sajaks 90minute show which will rely on the 
traditional format pioneered by jack paar however it will be 
spiced by live interviews with los angeles locals everything from 
punk rockers to melon merchants 
sajak said he also considered having a female sidekick but opted 
instead for dan miller 
viewers familiar with his gameshow role with letterturner vanna 
white might be upset as though vanna and i had gotten a divorce 
or something sajak said 
hall who was guest host on foxs late show said he will try 
to create an air of spontaneity on his hourlong show and plans to 
avoid relying on guests with youth appeal 
id love to talk to ronald reagan he said there isnt 
anyone who i would consider too old and square

one man sought in the fatal shooting of a 
sheriffs deputy was arrested monday and a second was found dead 
after apparently committing suicide in a cabin where he had holed 
up authorities said 
the man arrested in connection with the new years eve shooting 
of navajo county deputy bob varner was tentatively identified as 
raul lopez 
the second man tentatively identified as douglas savory 45 was 
found dead of a gunshot wound to the face after police fired tear 
gas into the cabin near winslow a state department of public safety 
spokesman said 
earlier monday the man had fired at officers and a law 
enforcement helicopter and apparently killed himself afterward dps 
spokesman sgt allan schmidt said 
a 33mile stretch of interstate 40 was closed for about six 
hours forcing drivers to make a 167mile detour onto lesser routes 
to the north because the cabin was less than a quartermile from 
the interstate 
after the tear gas was fired officers entered the cabin with 
orders to shoot to kill said navajo county sheriff gary butler 
mr savory was an extremely dangerous man butler said 
every time we had contact with him he turned on us he shot 
officer varner before he even had a chance to react he turned on 
two of our cars while we were trying to pursue him every time that 
we made contact with him i ended up with several bullet holes in my 
patrol cars 
the owner of the cabin called police monday morning after he went 
there and recognized that something was amiss schmidt said 
a california warrant accused savory of robbery and kidnapping in 
a september gunstore robbery in which five other people have been 
arrested schmidt said 
savory also has been investigated in connection with 
manufacturing and sale of illegal weapons and explosives and is 
well known to authorities at the california state and federal 
level schmidt said sunday 
lopez he said may be a citizen of mexico but we have very 
little on his background 
lopez who was unarmed was arrested without resistance in 
holbrook after an officer recognized him police lt ken moore said 
lopez was turned over to sheriffs deputies for questioning moore 
said 
chief deputy arleigh richmond said lopez would be treated at a 
flagstaff hospital for frostbite to his feet and then returned to 
holbrook possibly on tuesday to be booked richmond said it had 
not been determined what charges would be filed against lopez 
varner 51 was shot three times saturday night after he stopped 
a car with two suspects he died at a phoenix hospital early monday 
the suspects one of whom said he was a survivalist later tied 
up a couple with telephone cord at their home the men took the 
couples car and fired on a second patrol vehicle after a short 
chase the two wrecked the car and fled on foot schmidt said

the racially divided town of keysville held 
its first locally supervised election since the 1930s on monday 
reelecting the mayor and voting in her allblack council slate 
joseph cochran the 67yearold white challenger to mayor emma 
gresham said he wasnt surprised by the results after a ruling 
earlier monday by the burke county board of registrars against 
challenges he had filed against 84 black voters 
mrs gresham got 127 votes while cochran got 61 in the council 
races mrs greshams slate won all five seats by similar margins 
the ballots were counted monday night after the county registrars 
denied two challenges filed by cochran said gayle korotkin an 
attorney for christic institute south a nonprofit foundation that 
helped fight the challenges 
cochran had contended that the 84 voters he challenged did not 
live within the east georgia towns boundaries thirtyfive of the 
84 live in a section that was annexed by the town last year 
since the towns boundaries have not been established i cant 
see hardly how you can annex more property into it cochran said 
alan gregory another attorney for christic institute south said 
the annexation was precleared by the us justice department and 
approved by the georgia secretary of states office 
in addition to the 35 voters living in the annexed area 
theyre challenging the same 49 people that were challenged in the 
last election gregory said those were nullified by the 
registrar at the end of the vote tallies there is no reason for 
those people to be challenged again 
cochran whose council slate included four whites and one black 
said monday night he would consult with his attorney before deciding 
whether to appeal the registrars decision 
the town is about 70 percent black and has about 230 registered 
voters 
keysvilles government was revived in january when mrs gresham 
and a slate of council members were elected to oneyear terms 
mondays election conducted under the towns original 1890 
charter was for 20month terms if the legislature approves a new 
charter subsequent elections will be for fouryear terms 
for reasons lost to time keysville deactivated its government in 
1933 in the 1980s black residents tried to reactivate it to get 
water sewers fire and police protection all of which the town 
lacked 
there were problems defining boundaries however since the 
original charter described the city limits as everything within a 
halfmile radius of a schoolhouse demolished about 1895 
white residents went to court to block the move to revive 
keysvilles government they denied they were worried about a 
possible black government and said their concern was that installing 
municipal services would tax poor blacks out of their homes 
mrs gresham and a council were elected the first time in 1985 
but white residents contention that the town limits were not 
defined was upheld in court and the vote was thrown out the state 
court issued an order forbidding the keysville officials from taking 
office 
those opposed to reactivating the government used the same 
argument to try to prevent elections last year but ultimately lost 
in federal court

philippine airlines on tuesday 
identified four people authorities say are members of a radical 
palestinian faction planning to hijack or blow up an asian airliner 
this month 
rollie estabillio spokesman for the airline said the four are 
believed to be members of a breakaway palestine liberation 
organization faction led by abu musa who is supported by syria and 
libya 
estabillio said the names were provided in a telex sent by 
authorities at tokyos narita international airport last month the 
message prompted increased security at asian airports in the wake of 
the dec 21 bombing of a pan am jetliner over scotland in which 270 
people were killed 
he identified them as mudh zaman bakar muhen albarani mustafa 
alburani and ahmed yasar and said they were believed to be carrying 
passports from india pakistan and oman 
he said officials at manilas ninoy aquino international airport 
were carefully screening all passengers from south asia and the 
middle east in view of the alert 
abu musa whose real name is said musa broke with plo chief 
yasser arafat in 1983 because of opposition to peace moves with 
israel and his anger over arafats failure to stop the israeli 1982 
invasion of lebanon 
last week asian aviation officials said they were warned by 
airindia of a possible attack on an asian aircraft by jan 10 
airindia refused comment but sources in new delhi said security 
was increased at airports in new delhi calcutta bombay and madras 
similar measures were ordered at airports in hong kong tokyo 
taipei manila dhaka bangladesh and colombo sri lanka 
on monday the philippines deported a syrian who was held at 
manila airport after australia refused to accept him because it 
suspected he was linked to a terrorist group officials said

bakerjian onto a philippine air lines flight bound for bangkok the 
capital of thailand 
immigration official ruben domingo said bakerjian left bangkok on 
dec 27 for sydney australia by way of manila australian 
authorities sent him back to the philippines and he was detained in 
manila on saturday 
domingo said australian authorities told manila that bakerjian 
tore up a greek passport which he used when entering the philippines 
and switched to a us passport when he arrived in sydney 
when the guy was interrogated the australians came to the 
conclusion he might be a suspected terrorist domingo said 
bakerjian denied being a member of an extremist group domingo 
said but he added that the philippines decided to play it safe 
especially with recent reports that some action would be taken 
against asian airlines by middle east terrorists

the 12foot wall of water that gushed 
from a 300footgap in a southern utah dike was down to a trickle by 
monday and residents cleaned up mud and debris from the flooded 50 
homes and 100 apartments 
no injuries were reported from the quail creek reservoir break 
early sunday that resulted in the evacuation of an estimated 1500 
along the virgin river 
the dike failure which also ruined four bridges and closed 
sections of area highways most of sunday prompted gov norm 
bangerter to declare washington county an emergency disaster area 
bangerters declaration was necessary to open disaster relief 
coffers a similar designation by the state federal emergency 
management agency office is expected later this week said county 
emergency services director tony hafen 
fema would reimburse up to 75 percent of the losses with the 
remainder covered by state and local governments hafen said 
teams of local state and federal engineers and other emergency 
service officials fanned out monday to assess the damage in an 
effort to put a price tag on the dike break and help residents 
recoup their losses 
the st george suburb of bloomington 300 miles south of salt 
lake city was hardest hit with up to 40 homes flooded 
bangerter said the 3 million dike part of a reservoir and dam 
project 14 miles east of st george will be rebuilt 
after the dike gave way early sunday authorities ordered the 
evacuation of 1500 people living along the virgin river the haste 
with which the evacuation was carried out angered some residents who 
said they may have saved more property had they not been so rushed 
evacuations were ordered just after midnight but the water did 
not reach their homes until well after 3 am 
we could have gotten a lot of stuff out if we had been given a 
more realistic time said myron nelson whose bloomington 
apartment was flooded we got the tv and the sewing machine out 
but there was a lot more we probably could have taken with us had we

french and british broadcast reports said monday 
that 17 trapped survivors of the dec 7 earthquake in soviet armenia 
were found in a wrecked bread factory after living for three weeks 
on grain and melted snow 
the report could not be immediately confirmed the official 
soviet news agency tass which has provided copious news on the 
rescue efforts made no mention of the report 
in paris europe 1 radio quoted a nurse for the french 
humanitarian group doctors of the world saying the 17 survivors were 
found in a bread factory near spitak a village in northwestern 
armenia that was virtually destroyed the nurse was quoted as saying 
they stayed alive by eating grain and drinking melted snow 
the nurse recently told a journalist at the station that the 
survivors were apparently found wednesday 21 days after the quake 
and the report reached yerevan on saturday the station had an 
earlier version of the report quoting the nurse as saying they were 
found saturday 
the male nurse spoke to europe 1 on condition of anonymity 
the london commercial radio station lbc reported that french 
medics said the 17 were found saturday 24 days after the quake 
rocked northwestern armenia it also said they stayed alive by 
eating grain and drinking melted snow 
it was not immediately possible to resolve the discrepancy over 
when the survivors were found the radio reports gave no details on 
the conditions of the survivors or where they are now 
the associated press was unable to reach by phone several 
regional government officials relief groups and press 
organizations in yerevan the armenian capital one official at the 
republics interior ministry said he knew of a smaller group of 
survivors found dec 24 or 26 but he had no details and it was not 
known if he was talking about the same group 
the quake killed an estimated 25000 people in soviet armenia and 
left about 400000 homeless it severely damaged leninakan a city 
of about 250000 near spitak 
armenias deputy prime minister vardkes artsruny said dec 23 
that authorities were calling off the search because they did not 
expect to find more survivors he said efforts would focus on 
rebuilding the southern republic 
in the weeks after the quake rescuers from the soviet union and 
abroad used dogs heavy equipment and often their own hands to pick 
through the wreckage in search of survivors 
in many cases they were guided by cries for help that sprang up 
from countless wrecked buildings 
the relief efforts provided many dramatic tales of human 
endurance and resourcefulness 
in one case a woman trapped in her basement for eight days 
helped keep her 3yearold alive by pricking her own fingers and 
letting the child suck her blood a soviet doctor said 
some people have sat in front of bulldozers to prevent the 
clearing of debris until it could be searched for survivors 
authorities wanted to bulldoze the rubble and spread quicklime to 
prevent the spread of disease from the corpses 
the quake which measured 69 on the richter scale was centered 
25 miles north of leninaken

mike has lived twice as long as might have been 
expected when doctors diagnosed his aids dan turner and cristofer 
shihar had one chance in five of seeing 1984 
they dont know why theyve survived what has been a death 
sentence for more than 45000 americans but say it may be a matter 
of attitude 
a lot of people dont die of the disease they die because they 
give up said mike a 34yearold chicagoan who was diagnosed with 
acquired immune deficienty syndrome in january 1984 he asked that 
his last name be withheld 
according to judith wiker a chicago holistic therapist who says 
she has counseled hundreds of clients with aids or aidsrelated 
problems mike is one of many people with the disease who are well 
enough to feel and act normal 
there are a lot of healthy people running around with aids 
she said 
scientists are trying to determine just why some people have 
survived as long as 10 years with aids the federal centers for 
disease control in atlanta is studying 119 people known to have 
lived with it for three or more years 
is the virus somehow different asks ann m hardy a cdc 
epidemiologist now at the national center for health statistics in 
hyattsville md is it something in their immune system 
does survival time hinge on the mildness or severity of the 
infections that attack people with aids or could the key really be 
a lifestylepsychosocial type of thing a positive attitude and 
emotional support 
all of these possibilities are now being studied either by the 
cdc or in studies funded by the national institutes of health 
for the purposes of the cdcs 2yearold study longterm 
survivors were defined as people who lived at least three years 
after being diagnosed 
unlike the estimated hundreds of thousands of americans who are 
infected with the aids virus but do not have symptoms longterm 
survivors actually have battled one or more ailments that define 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome including kaposis sarcoma 
pneumonia damaged immune systems and severe weight loss 
most longterm survivors are white homosexual men in their 30s 
whose main or only symptom is kaposis sarcoma the skin cancer that 
was rare before aids became an epidemic cdc data indicates 
the major issue people are interested in is what way the immune 
response for the longterm survivor is different than in the 
shortterm survivor said dr henry masur deputy chief of 
critical care medicine at the the clinical center of the nih in 
bethesda md 
with any disease whether its cancer or pneumonia in a 
healthy person some people get sick very quickly and die and other 
people survive much longer with breast cancer or colon cancer some 
people will be dead within a few months and some people will go for 
30 years masur said 
for mike an accountant three years of chemotherapy kept the 
skin sores of kaposis sarcoma at bay he then began treatment with 
the drug azt now called zidovudine which prolongs the lives of 
many with aids 
mike who considers himself fairly lucky said his only 
current health problem is mild leg pain im basically as normal 
as they get nobody would know if they saw me on the street that i 
had been diagnosed with aids 
turner 42 of san francisco was diagnosed with kaposis in 
february 1982 before most americans including doctors had heard 
of aids 
i do believe one can live with aids and strike up a bargain and 
coexist with the virus as we do with other viruses said turner 
he underwent chemotherapy a year of acupuncture took megadoses 
of vitamin c for a while has taken zidovudine intermittently since 
early 1988 and still gets alphainterferon a genetically engineered 
anticancer drug 
i go to the gym regularly and i try to maintain my weight and 
my energy level said turner who writes and performs music a 
friend and i have just finished writing a movie script which we 
hope to sell 
shihar 38 of los angeles was diagnosed with kaposis in 
november 1982 and said hes done just about the opposite of all 
the recommended treatments but his illness went into remission 
anyway 
i would love to say it was all very spiritual but i was in 
remission before i became spiritual said shihar who works for 
northern lights alternatives a new yorkbased education and support 
organization for people with aids i think the one thing i hear 
from people i know who have survived is theyre real stubborn 
ms wiker believes there is a certain kind of person that is a 
survivor with aids that kind of personality is one that starts 
living in the moment a person that is letting go of their past 
feelings and fears and theyre letting go of future projections 
about death 
that theory is being tested in a federally funded study at the 
new york state psychiatric institute where 450 people infected with 
the aids virus are being tracked for five years to determine whether 
their emotional state influences their resistance to the illness 
most people would like to believe they have control over this 
and if they remain optimistic and cheerful it will help said dr 
jack m gorman associate professor of clinical psychiatry at 
columbia university college of physicians and surgeons and principal 
investigator in the study 
and we certainly want to encourage people to remain optimistic 
and cheerful but we dont really know if it makes a difference or 
not and thats what were trying to see he added 
regardless of psychological factors survival prospects 
continually improve in newly diagnosed aids cases thanks to drug 
treatments such as zidovudine and an aerosol form of pentamidine a 
medication that fights the rare type of pneumonia that has been 
highly fatal to aids patients 
as recently as two years ago 80 percent of people with aids were 
expected to die within 24 months but that has changed dramatically 
said dr nathaniel pier a new york city physician with a large 
number of aids patients 
the cdc says it cant currently estimate aids victims average 
survival 
as of november 1988 we can assist somebody to stay alive and 
healthy for two years with the current therapy piers said and 
a great deal may occur in two years weve seen an enormous change 
from 1986 to 1988 
many people being diagnosed now may benefit from breakthroughs 
that will totally change the surface of the disease

clarisse a calf with an electric heart is 
one sign that political fighting over federal funding hasnt stopped 
researchers trying to develop a permanent replacement for as many as 
400 diseased hearts a year 
clarisse got her heart dec 8 about eight months after the 
national institutes of health decided to suspend 20 million in 
contracts for research on a permanent artificial heart and six 
months after the nih reversed itself 
dr claude lenfant director of the national hearth lung and 
blood institute a part of the nih questioned in may whether more 
than a decade of research would lead to a permanent heart that the 
body wouldnt reject 
under pressure from members of congress lenfant said in july 
that the contracts would not be suspended the five groups funded 
are hershey medical center of pennsylvania state university the 
university of utah abiomed inc of danvers mass working with the 
texas heart institute of houston and nimbus co of rancho cordova 
calif working with the cleveland clinic 
clearly there is controversy in the medical community over 
whether or not the artificial heart is the right device sen john 
heinz rpa said recently if funding is cut off now we will 
never know if the artificial heart was the right answer 
researchers at penn state and utah have been working since the 
mid1970s on electrical versions of the airdriven or pneumatic 
heart first implanted in seattle dentist barney clark in december 
1982 at the university of utah 
recipients of airdriven hearts remain mostly bedridden in 
hospitals linked by tubes to large compressors unless they get 
human heart transplants recipients of the electric heart will be 
able to walk exercise and even work 
the advantage of these hearts is that youll be able to put 
everything inside the patients chest except the battery said 
gerson rosenberg assistant chief of penn states division of 
artifical organs 
nobody is ever saying that this is going to be as good as a 
natural heart that this patient is going to forget hes got it and 
go on to live a normal life thats not true rosenberg said 
because the devices must meet specific requirements such as 
pumping eight liters of blood a minute designs are similar at all 
five research facilities the penn state device which has the size 
and heft of a squared softball has a 10pound rechargeable battery 
pack on a waist belt a battery in the heart will let a recipient 
take off the external battery for up to 45 minutes 
the device designed to last about five years probably will cost 
about the 80000 to 100000 that a heart transplant costs 
rosenberg said 
hershey began testing its electric models in animals in 1983 one 
implanted jan 8 1983 in a calf named et short for 
electric total enabled the animal to live 222 days a record 
on any electric artificial heart 
since then the device has grown smaller closer in size to a 
human heart as researchers make use of advancements in a 
miniaturized electronics 
rosenberg said he expects human tests to begin in the late 1990s 
researchers had hoped to start the trials in the early 1990s but 
scaling down the electronics proved more difficult than expected 
despite the delays in perfecting a permanent heart there have 
been benefits from the research including better knowledge of drugs 
to prevent heart disease or strokes improved design on commonly 
used artificial heart valves and better techniques and materials 
for use in cardiac bypass surgery 
rosenberg said the progress thats been made against heart 
disease is unlikely to eliminate the need for artificial heart 
research 
i dont think anything would please the people working on the 
artificial heart more than to hear that something was discovered to 
prevent all that he said but i doubt that that will happen

samuel gruber wants to change the 
perception of sharks as prehistoric and says the oceangoing 
killing machines have a complex immune system that could become an 
antibody factory for humans 
gruber a university of miami biological oceanographer has been 
intrigued with sharks since an underwater encounter with a 
hammerhead in 1958 
after 30 years of studying them the most astonishing thing 
ive found about sharks is that they are so sophisticated they have 
so many systems that are in higher animals that if you didnt know 
better youd think that like the whales they evolved on land 
and went back to the sea 
gruber studies the lemon shark unique because it can survive 
while motionless in the water making observation easier among the 
oddities he has observed are its eyes which differ among various 
sharks its reproductive system and its highly generalized but 
extremely powerful immune system 
sharks eyes are unusual because some can close like a humans 
and others are covered by a transparent nictitating membrane gruber 
said thats just totally unheard of in fish sharks have eyes 
more or less like a cats with split pupils it certainly cannot be 
explained 
the reproductive system more closely resembles a mammals than a 
fishs 
the lemon shark takes up to 15 years to reach sexual maturity 
then gives live birth to a dozen pups every other year while fish 
lay thousands of eggs the shark gives birth complete with placenta 
and umbilical cord 
only three of the dozen pups are likely to survive two years 
which has profound implications for human treatment of sharks which 
many people still see as a dangerous pest or at best a source of 
meat gruber said you want to exploit that resource but you want 
it renewable while a pair of salmon can lay 10000 eggs and 
reproduce its entire species sharks and whales can only have a very 
low number of young after a very very long period of time 
that means they are surprisingly fragile as a species traps off 
south africa have virtually eliminated sharks in only a few years 
that would have a disastrous effect on many other species gruber 
said sharks are predators and essential to evolution by 
eliminating weaker members of species 
but humans might have even more reason to mourn the loss of 
sharks 
products from sharks immune system have shown promise in 
treating diseases he said they are not only able to make 
antibodies they already have antibodies to many disease that they 
would never see or get such as human smallpox why this is i dont 
know 
when attacked by a disease sharks generate huge amounts of 
antibodies making them a potential factory for helping humans fight 
diseases like aids or cancer he said if we could keep a number 
of sharks and raise antibodies then each person could have his own 
shark his own antibody factory 
there is evidence of cancerfighting potential in the sharks 
skeleton gruber said researchers were actually able to isolate a 
protein that when injected into the tumor would cause it to dry up 
and die 
side effects make such treatment impractical for humans but 
gruber is interested because he suffers from a cancer of the lymph 
system that causes his joints to swell he goes regularly to 
california for an experimental treatment that involves injections of 
rat antibodies 
despite cancer and occasional accidents including a mangled hand 
nearly drowning and having a shark almost tear his leg off gruber 
said he intends to continue his underwater research we owe it to 
the world to study something like the shark and you cant do it 
from the top of a hill with field glasses

scientists looking for ways to 
provide food oxygen and sewage treatment for space travelers are 
growing wheat in a computercontrolled capsule that mimics earths 
ecosystem 
the kennedy space center scientists cultivated their garden by 
hand for about three years in the 12by23foot biomass production 
chamber and then turned it over in midnovember to a computer 
the computer makes sure that the wheat growing hydroponically gets 
enough light air water and fertilizer 
if youre truly permanently going to space youve got to have 
a system like this says plant physiologist william knott head of 
the project 
without such a system knott says astronauts would need regular 
shipments of fresh air potable water and prepared food 
prohibitively expensive for any planned space habitats and 
impossible for voyaging spaceships 
sooner or later were going to get tired of sending tv dinners 
out and bringing portapotties back said agricultural engineer 
john sager 
one problem is trying to cram enough of the important parts of 
the biosphere into a container small enough to fit in a spaceship 
said ralph prince another agricultural engineer in the physical 
world if you model a dam on the tennessee river you build 
everything smaller when we model the biological process we 
cant build people smaller 
a life support system in flight might carry several staple crops 
such as wheat rice beans soy potatoes peanuts and lettuce and 
might carry only 25 gallons of water astronauts would have to 
recycle water to stretch the supply 
another obstacle is converting sewage into a fertilizer that 
wont kill the plants which thrive on a carefully blended chemical 
solution 
a prototype life support system could be ready for a ground test 
by 1995 but it could be 2020 before a system would be available for 
flight testing say national aeronautics and space administration

women may be only a button away from 
controlling the severity of their labor pains during childbirth 
according to a north carolina researcher who studied a 
selfadministered painkilling technique 
the technique patientcontrolled epidural analgesia lets a 
woman control the amount of pain medication she gets patients who 
used it tended to use less than those who got medication from a 
doctor or nurse said steven z lysak who directed a study of 74 
women at wake forest university medical center 
in addition to potentially limiting fetal exposure to anesthesia 
the selfadministered technique provides a psychological advantage 
by increasing patient participation in the labor process 
researchers said 
using this technique women safely and effectively treated 
their own pain throughout the course of labor said lysak who 
presented his findings last year at the annual meeting of the 
american society of anesthesiologists 
patients who use the technique push a button to administer a 
measured dose of a painrelieving medication a thin tube inserted 
near the patients spinal cord in the lower back carries medication 
to nerves and receptors the device has a timer to prevent a patient 
from overdosing herself

a biomedical engineer and an anesthesiologist 
are working on a hightech version of the stethoscope with three 
sound pickups instead of the single amplifier doctors use to chill 
their patients 
the multichannel electronic stethoscope designed by daniel benson 
and jeffrey joseph improves the doctors ability to hear and monitor 
the supply of oxygen to a patients lungs during surgery and lets 
the anesthesiologist hear the heart and changes in breathing sounds 
from each lung 
the sound is amplified filtered mixed and transmitted to a 
headset worn by the anesthesiologist who can isolate each channel 
or hear all three 
it can help determine if an oxygen tube has shifted or is 
inserted incorrectly or if a lung has collapsed said joseph an 
anesthesiologist at chestnut hill hospital by using the 
multichannel stethoscope and comparing the sounds you can recognize 
problems that much faster 
you can localize even a slight wheeze by turning up the volume 
and come up with a good diagnosis 
joseph and benson of thomas jefferson university have applied 
for a patent for their version of the device first invented in 1819 
by renee laennec a french physician the patent office says 324 
patents for stethoscopes have been issued in the united states 
including 102 electronic versions and 173 with special acoustic 
properties

do your ears hurt when your jetliner starts 
descending for a landing here are some tips from the nations ear 
nose and throat doctors to relieve the discomfort 
pop your ears to equalize the pressure pinch your nostrils 
take in a mouthful of air and with your mouth closed use your 
cheek and throat muscles to force the air into the back of your nose 
as if you were trying to blow your fingers off your nose when you 
feel a pop in your ears you may have succeeded said dr robert 
schindler of the american academy of otolaryngology and head and 
neck surgery 
if necessary repeat the procedure several times but stop if it 
hurts 
try swallowing and yawning to activate the muscle that opens the 
eustachian tube connecting the back of the throat with the middle 
ear chewing gum or letting mints melt in your mouth will help you 
swallow more often 
avoid sleeping during descent you may not swallow enough to 
keep up with pressure changes if you are asleep 
if you have allergies take antihistamines at the start of the 
flight or a decongestent pill or nose spray an hour or so before 
descent 
schindler said the medications will help your ears pop more 
easily but they shouldnt be used by people with heart disease 
high blood pressure irregular heart rhythms thyroid disease or 
excessive nervousness 
if your ears fail to open or pain persists after landing you may 
need to consult your ear doctor he said

consumers confidence about the state of the 
economy increased in december boosted by low inflation low 
unemployment and growth in personal income a businessfinanced 
research organization reported 
the conference boards consumer confidence index increased to 
1198 up nearly 7 points from november the board said in a report 
for release tuesday the index had declined in november to 1131 
from octobers figure of 1169 
people interviewed for the survey were particularly positive 
about the current economic situation the board said with this 
component of the confidence index reaching its highest point since 
the boom years of the late 1960s 
the monthly survey of 5000 us households is conducted for the 
board by national family opinion inc of toledo ohio 
the consumers very favorable assessment of prevailing 
conditions reflects the continued vigor of the economy and bodes 
well for the immediate future said fabian linden executive 
director of the boards consumer research center 
unemployment is at its lowest level in many years personal 
income continues to grow and the inflation rate is virtually 
imperceptible to the average shopper he said in a statement 
all these factors contribute to a high level of confidence 
still there is some uncertainty about the future with the 
policies of the new administration on such major issues as the 
federal budget and the foreign trade deficits still unknown he 
added 
buying plans among those surveyed remained at roughly the same 
level for the past few months the board said about 7 percent of 
respondents said they plan to purchase a car within six months 35 
percent intend to buy a home in the period and nearly 29 percent 
plan to buy a major appliance

a wealth of job opportunities is luring tens of 
thousands of south and southeast asians to japan forcing this once 
isolated nation to cope with the problem of migrant labor 
more than half the foreigners working at companies investigated 
by the labor ministry between oct 16 and nov 16 were found to be 
working illegally a recent report showed 
poor working conditions and the risk of deportation havent 
discouraged the wave of workers from less wealthy asian nations nor 
have wages that are low by japanese standards although because of 
the strong yen high in the foreign workers own countries 
the japanese government so far has responded to the surge in 
foreign labor with plans to open its doors wider to foreign 
professionals but it has reaffirmed a ban on manual laborers 
provoking a national debate over the merits of internationalizing 
japans closed society 
while government and private groups study the problem the influx 
of illegal foreign workers continues to grow 
in 1987 the labor ministry deported 11307 foreigners for 
working illegally in the first half of this year japanese police 
and immigration authorities arrested 7196 foreigners for working 
illegally up from 5802 in the first half of 1987 
but those numbers compare with police estimates that about 70000 
illegal foreign workers are in japan 
about half the illegal workers are men 
women often recruited by crime syndicates long have flocked to 
japan to work often legally as entertainers human rights 
groups say the gangs that control japans underworld often force 
them into working as prostitutes 
since 1985 however the number of illegal male workers in japan 
has ballooned as unskilled workers from the philippines bangladesh 
and pakistan find ready employment labor ministry figures show 
in the ministrys investigation of 202 foreigners working at 
15796 companies 111 were working illegally kyodo news service 
reported 
it said 54 of the illegal workers were from bangladesh 36 from 
pakistan 13 from india two each from ghana taiwan and thailand 
and one each from the philippines and south korea 
most of the clandestine laborers worked long hours with no 
vacations for low wages having overstayed tourist visas after 
finding work at construction sites or in small metal working 
chemical or food processing factories the report said 
despite the government ban firms that hire foreign manual 
workers are not penalized a shortage of japanese willing to do 
manual labor encourages them to employ foreigners who often are 
reluctant to complain of poor treatment due to the risk of 
deportation said eiko shinotsuka a labor economist at ochanomizu 
university in tokyo 
both men and women working illegally are vulnerable to 
exploitation because of their illegal status said yaeko takeoka a 
lawyer familiar with the problems of clandestine workers 
japanese employees in the metal working industry receive average 
hourly wages of 2150 yen or about 1720 clandestine workers 
receive hourly wages of 500 to 700 yen or 4 to 560 labor 
ministry figures show 
but a few months of even low wages in japanese yen amount to a 
fortune for migrant workers due to the lower cost of living in other 
asian countries japans average per capita income is about 17000 
compared with 550 in the philippines 113 in bangladesh and 360 
in pakistan 
by living together in small apartments to save on expenses the 
clandestine workers manage to send about half their wages home to 
their families isolated in a society where they must constantly 
hide from police and immigration officials few plan to stay in 
japan indefinitely 
they just come for short stays shinotsuka said 
economists say the influx of illegal laborers is unlikely to 
abate because japans 24 percent unemployment rate reflects a trend 
toward shortages of workers in certain industries 
a recent report by the national council for development of an 
economic structure of the 21st century predicted that japan will 
face a shortage of 27 million workers by the year 2000 if current 
economic trends continue 
the council recommended that japan accept unskilled and 
semiskilled foreign workers and suggested establishment of a system 
to prevent exploitation of guest workers 
numerous commentaries also have urged that japan welcome its less 
affluent neighbors 
in japan we dont accept political asylum and we turn our 
backs on immigrants maybe in the short run this is a wise policy 
in avoiding problems however can we say this policy is right over 
the long run wrote commentator yunosuke ohkura in the japan times 
noting that japanese believe they are unique and therefore 
superior mitsunobu sugiyama of the university of tokyo said in a 
recent article in the japan quarterly that constant contact with 
the people of other nations on this very personal level would do 
much to open japanese eyes and help them better understand the rest 
of the world 
a recent report by a labor ministry advisory panel however 
concluded that foreign manual laborers were undesirable their 
unfamiliarity with japanese language and customs it said could 
cause social conflict

eastern airlines smaller and deeper in debt than a 
year ago begins 1989 facing federal mediation considered crucial to 
what the carrier will look like a year from now if it still exists 
we simply cannot survive if the national mediation board 
persists in holding eastern hostage as it has been doing wrote 
tom matthews easterns senior vice president for human resources 
in a dec 28 letter to walter c wallace chairman of the mediation 
board 
wallace will participate in jan 6 mediation at an undisclosed 
location between eastern and its machinists union the mediation 
sessions with no deadline set by the federal board are aimed at 
settling a 16monthold contract dispute that has been before the 
board for a year 
failure to reach agreement could lead to the mediation boards 
declaration of an impasse that would trigger a 30day coolingoff 
period after which the union could strike and eastern could impose 
its own work conditions 
while some union leaders suspect the hardline texas air corp 
ownership would like a strike so that it could try to break the 
strike and bust the union the struggling airline might not last 
through disruptions and much more negative publicity 
eastern ended the year with new public questions about its safety 
after an emergency landing dec 26 in charleston wva of an 
eastern flight with a hole in its fuselage there were no injuries 
and company officials say eastern has one of the industrys best 
safety records 
but the incident came after eastern earlier in the year went 
through a comprehensive federal aviation administration probe and 
department of transportation scrutiny those studies said eastern 
was safe but its unusually bad labormanagement relations could 
threaten safety 
executives of easterns pilots union will meet early this month 
to discuss their contract talks begun about six months ago with 
management the pilots are also hopeful the national mediation 
board which has set final briefs for early february will agree 
with them that eastern and its texas air sister continental 
airlines are being run as a single carrier 
a singlecarrier ruling could lead to unionization of 
continental to which texas air has transferred some eastern assets 
because of its nonunion status the pilots union says eastern 
officials say continental is run separately from eastern 
the pilots havent said whether they would honor a machinists 
strike 
since machinists negotiations began eastern has laid off 7233 
employees or about a fifth of its workforce and lost 319 million 
the company says 
it has been lobbying ardently for declaration of an impasse 
bringing the 30day deadline the company says will force movement in 
the negotiations 
eastern reported 2337 million in losses for the first three 
quarters of 1988 and its loss for the past decade totals 13 
billion 
management and its largest union the 8500worker machinists 
are 200 million apart in their latest contract offers but besides 
money there are important philosophical differences between the two 
sides 
machinists district 100 president charles e bryan firmly 
believes workers should have a major role in company 
decisionmaking his dream has been an employeeowned eastern 
the management of eastern bought nearly three years ago by 
houstonbased texas air has been more interested in slashing the 
wages of the nonmechanics in the machinists union mechanics 
comprise about half the union but the management says it must cut 
baggage handler and other nonmechanic wages 
some baggage handlers for example woud have hourly wages cut 
over three years from 1560 to 10 mechanics who comprise about 
half the union would be cut only by small amounts union officials 
have described the company offer as a divideandconquer strategy to 
split the union between mechanics and the other workers 
eastern management also points out that machinists refused to 
take the 20 percent salary cuts agreed to by its pilots and flight 
attendants unions in february 1986 in an effort to stave off 
bankruptcy or the sale to texas air machinists leaders say eastern 
employees are being told to suffer even more for bad management that 
isnt committed to keeping eastern alive 
the unions say texas air chairman frank lorenzo is stripping away 
easterns assets and will abandon a carcass 
the 365 million sale of easterns profitable northeast shuttle 
service to new york developer donald trump and the earlier spinoff 
of easterns computer reservations system to texas air are cited to 
support that argument planes and gates have also been sold and 
eastern reportedly has been offering other assets such as canadian 
routes 
eastern says it needs cash infusions to keep operating 
bryan who portrays his unions resistance to lorenzo as a 
virtual holy war has sought a white knight to rescue eastern 
employees and allow them to take over the airline but the only 
reported serious talks last year about buying eastern were with twa 
chairman carl icahn who wanted steep union concessions 
in a nov 9 letter to bryan lorenzo who hadnt deigned to 
communicate directly with bryan until recent months said the 
contract negotiations were the most realistic way to help the 
airline 
time is running against eastern lorenzo wrote

the nations economy closed 1988 with vigorous 
growth with december posting the biggest increase in the rates of 
production and new orders for goods since july according to a 
survey of corporate purchasing executives released tuesday 
december exited like a lion said robert j bretz chairman 
of the national association of purchasing managements business 
survey committee the continued robust growth capped the final 
quarter at what could be the strongest growth rate of the year 
except for a solid downtrend in the rate of inflation there 
were few signs of the anticipated slowing in this the seventh year 
of the recovery added bretz who is director of materials 
management at pitney bowes inc 
the groups purchasing managers index increased to 581 percent 
in december compared with 566 percent in november the december 
figure was the highest since julys 59 percent a reading above 50 
percent indicates that the economy is generally expanding below 50 
that it is generally declining 
the groups seasonally adjusted production index advanced to 613 
percent compared with 582 percent in november it was the highest 
since julys 627 percent according to the monthly survey of 
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies 
the index of new orders rose to 601 percent up from 58 percent 
in november and the highest since 621 percent in july 
the employment growth rate index slowed only slightly in december 
to 575 percent except for novembers 579 percent it was at its 
highest level since december 1987 
new export orders increased at the highest rate since july after 
growing at a slower rate for the four previous months the survey 
found of those members of the trade group who export 30 percent 
reported higher export orders up from 22 percent in november the 6 
percent who indicated lower export orders was down from 8 percent in 
november 
vendor deliveries which indicate whether companies are receiving 
orders faster than they can deliver them contined to slow in 
december to 54 percent compared with novembers 521 percent 
reflecting the seasonally strong growth in production the 
association said 
inventories also increased but at a lesser rate than in 
november the seasonally adjusted inventory index was 514 percent 
in december compared with novembers 526 percent this suggests 
that some modest inventory buildup may have occurred to hedge 
against announced jan 1 price increases and to alleviate shortages 
in some commodities the group said 
the growth rate in prices was lower for the sixth consecutive 
month and was at its lowest level since may 1987 the survey found 
confirming a solid decline in inflation since midyear 
in another survey last month a majority of the groups members 
said they believed the economy would do better this year than in 
1988 with continued growth and slower inflation

the folks at clemons boot co would like to 
stick to making standardsized boots to sell off the shelf but 
loggers and cowboys keep walking through the door after cutting off 
a toe or breaking a leg 
one of the first guys who came to us had a brace that fit on 
the inside of a boot said walt clemons the patriarch of the 
family business he couldnt find a storebought boot to fit him 
a little while ago we made a caulked boot for a guy with a 
walking cast said clemons son bill he was selfemployed and 
said he had to get back to work 
wed really kind of like to phase that out but thats our 
bread and butter people keep us so busy with custom work we cant 
really do that 
the clemons family walt his wife anita their son bill and 
his wife theresa specializes in making caulked boots and packers 
caulked pronounced corked boots have high laceup tops and 
spikes known as caulks corks on the soles they are favored by 
loggers for sure footing on logs rocks and steep hillsides 
packers are laceup cowboy boots that offer pointed toes and tall 
heels to fit a stirrup while riding a horse and ankle support while 
walking on the ground 
with anita cutting out the leather pieces theresa sewing them 
together walt forming the uppers over the last and bill finishing 
them off with soles the clemons family turns out three pairs of 
boots a day 
although clemons sells through a few retail outlets in oregon and 
washington and have filled an order that came out of the blue from 
horsehead ny they are a small outfit and like it that way 
were small enough that we dont have people coming in and 
telling us what we can and cant do says anita 
the caulked boot business is such a limited market that the 
japanese and the other countries are not interested says bill 
if you were talking dress loafers we couldnt compete 
the 225 they charge for a pair of standardsized caulked boots 
is competitive with massproduced boots its 50 extra for a custom 
fit 
the clemons family once tried to boost production by hiring some 
help but it didnt work out 
people dont care the way we care anita said theyre used 
to getting mill wages and we couldnt pay it 
disdaining cardboard they put steel shanks and stiff nylon heel 
counters in the caulked boots to make them more rugged 
the foot part of the boot is sewn on with the smooth skin side of 
the leather on the inside to make them tougher still 
if the skin side is out you can cut that on a rock the first 
day and it wont hold grease to keep the water out bill said 
they rely on satisfied customers to get the word out weve 
only advertised two times bill said 
packers with red tops and black bottoms were all the rage for 
awhile among working cowboys 
the buckeroos dont make much money but what little they do 
make they put into their gear says walt you ride the range all 
day and a goodlooking boot can be something to talk about

iraq has cut oil exports by 90000 barrels 
a day in accordance with its new opec production quota of 264 
million barrels a day the official iraqi news agency reported 
monday 
the agency monitored in cyprus said that as of jan 1 iraq had 
stopped trucking 65000 barrels a day to jordans red sea port of 
aqaba and another 25000 barrels a day through turkey 
meanwhile king fahd of saudi arabia on monday launched a 
multibillion deficit budget for fiscal 1989 with a warning that 
saudi arabia would not be bound by opecfixed oil production quotas 
if others violated them 
iraq currently exports 15 million barrels a day through a 
pipeline across turkey to mediterranean ports and another 500000 
barrels a day through a pipeline across saudi arabia to the red sea 
port of yanbu the agency said 
iraqs quota matching that of iran was set by the 13member 
organization of petroleum exporting countries at a cartel meeting in 
vienna in november 
previously iran had a cap of 24 million barrels a day compared 
to 15 million barrels a day for iraq which was heavily exceeding 
its quota 
the former gulf war enemies badly need increased oil revenues in 
order to rebuild economies shattered by 8 years of hostilities 
in riyadh saudi arabia the official saudi press agency said 
budget outlays for the worlds biggest oilexporting nation were 
approved at a weekly cabinet session chaired by king fahd 
expenditures were set at 141 million riyals or about 376 
billion against projected revenues of 116 billion riyals or 309 
billion 
that left a deficit of 25 billion riyals or 67 billion down 
from 359 billion riyals for 1988 to be covered by public 
borrowing the agency said 
budget deficits have become a chronic problem in saudi arabia and 
other oilproducing nations since crude prices started slipping in 
the early 1980s because of a world glut 
the new restrictive opec quota system took effect on sunday in a 
fresh attempt to remedy the situation 
king fahd stressed the importance of discipline and adherence 
to the quotas if prices are to improve 
he warned that although saudi arabia is the first state to 
abide by what opec agrees to i dont think that anyone can blame 
the kingdom if the contract is broken 
we do not want to see that to happen under any circumstances 
and it is hoped that the losses suffered by the opec states give an 
idea of what can result from a chaos as happened a few years ago 
and again a year ago he added

economists will tell you they make their 
prognostications on the basis of the data not gut feelings 
about the economy 
but some attending last weeks conference here of the american 
economic association were bold enough to venture guesses on the fate 
of the economy without their usual battery of numbers at hand 
yes there were scores of seminars during the conference on such 
esoteric topics as empirical analysis of price determinants and 
we wonder why johnny cant understand simple rules of economics 
but there was also a fair amount of cocktail and luncheon chatter 
about what economists might call exogenous or outside 
factors affecting the ebb and flow of the economy principal among 
them politics george bushs politics to be more precise 
theories about how the presidentelect will manage the economy 
span the usual spectrum as you might expect yet a predominantly 
hopeful theory is emerging in some quarters based on bushs 
transition performance 
while some pundits have criticized his recently announced cabinet 
selections as bland others are impressed by the mix of key 
holdovers from the reagan administration and new choices aimed at 
mending fences with old opponents 
so far these optimists say bush has done several things right 
when the markets reacted negatively in the days following his 
election he moved swiftly to name his economic team long 
before settling on advisers for defense and other areas 
among his earliest choices was nicholas brady to remain as 
treasury secretary a pick that was applauded by those who admired 
bradys work as head of the reagan committee investigating the 
october 1987 stock market crash having james a baker iii a former 
treasury secretary and an architect of past accords to stabilize the 
dollar in world markets as secretary of state also was seen as a 
plus by some economic experts 
later additions that have drawn praise are michael boskin of 
stanford university to chief economic adviser clayton yeutter to 
agriculture secretary robert mosbacher to commerce secretary and 
elizabeth dole to head the labor department 
the dole move was viewed as especially significant since it not 
only installed an experienced hand at the wheel of labor but also 
helped smooth the ruffled feathers of the secretarydesignates 
husband senate minority leader robert dole rkan 
other rough spots in the road that bush quickly patched were in 
massachusetts he initiated a meeting with his defeated challenger 
michael dukakis and also offered to make exhouse speaker tip 
oneill the next ambassador to ireland neither of the highprofile 
democrats will end up serving the new administration but bushs 
thoughtful gestures werent lost on the loyal opposition 
the optimists say bushs style may help him make strides on 
capitol hill where democratic cooperation will be crucial to 
keeping his pledge of no new taxes 
one economist at last weeks conference james smith of the 
university of north carolina said he predicts a great rose garden 
compromise along about april that will put a twoyear federal 
budget in place restrain the deficit and maybe even avoid new taxes 
that certainly would provide the socalled soft landing the 
economy needs to avert recession in 1989 
nonbelievers would say such finetuning went out a long time 
ago about the time paul volcker used skyhigh interest rates to 
squelch inflation still the prospect of striking a delicate 
balance in economic policy between bust and boom is intriguing 
particularly now a few weeks before the inauguration when hope 
springs eternal
