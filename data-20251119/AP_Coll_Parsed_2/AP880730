the federal deposit insurance corp said late 
friday it was pledging 4 billion for ncnb corp of charlotte 
nc to take over first republicbank corp of dallas in 
potentially the largest federal bank rescue ever 
the fdic which in march pumped 1 billion into banks owned by 
the ailing holding company said it will infuse an additional 2 
billion to wipe out the companys negative net worth and expects 
eventually to have to pay out another 1 billion to cover bad loans 
ncnb has agreed to pay between 210 million and 240 million to 
acquire a 20 percent stake in what will be called ncnb texas 
national bank for five years it will have an exclusive option to 
purchase the 80 percent of the bank which will be owned by the fdic 
fdic chairman l william seidman said texas billionaire h ross 
perot had promised to act as a standby to ensure that ncnbs share 
of the investment is paid in time but said he doubted that perots 
help would be needed 
the first republicbank deal rivals the 1984 rescue of 
continental illinois bank amp trust co of chicago the largest bank 
bailout to date in that case the fdics initial outlay was 45 
billion although it expects to recover all but 17 billion 
seidman said the ultimate cost of the first republicbank 
transaction is expected to be significantly lower than the 
initial outlay but said it is certainly possible the ultimate 
cost could be greater than the expected 17 billion cost of the 
continental illinois deal 
he said all of first republicbanks 41 subsidiary banks would 
remain open under their normal schedule including those with 
saturday hours the banks will open under their new name on monday 
no first republicbank depositor will lose a single cent 
said comptroller of the currency robert clarke 
seidman said the transaction so far was an agreement in 
principle and he said he expected it to be made final somewhere 
in the next three months 
until then the fdic has taken control of the banks under a 
bridge bank arrangement a new legal device authorized by congress 
last year it is being used for only the second time ncnb will 
manage the banks on the fdics behalf 
in order for the fdic to take over first republicbank under 
bridge bank rules the comptroller of the currency the regulator 
of nationally chartered banks and texas regulators had to first 
declare the banks owned by the holding company insolvent 
this leaves owners of the holding companys 12 billion in debt 
and preferred stock with little chance of being repaid however 
the creditors of the subsidiary banks will be protected the 
companys bonds have been trading recently at below 20 cents on the 
dollar 
seidman said it wouldnt surprise me if we see some lawsuits 
from bond holders 
he said ncnb was chosen from among five bidders because it 
offered the least costly alternative the fdic believes was 
viable the next best bid would have cost the agency nearly 1 
billion more he said 
seidman declined to name the unsuccessful bidders however 
published reports have identified the four wells fargo amp co of 
san francisco citicorp of new york an investment group eaded by 
first republicbanks management and another investment group headed 
by former texas sen john tower 
the fdic which gets its money through an assessment on the 
nations 14000 commercial banks and guarantees deposits up to 
100000 is having one of its worst years ever 
last year 184 banks failed a postdepression record and equal 
number or slightly more are expected to fail this year 
all this is expected to cause the fdics insurance fund to 
suffer its first loss this year seidman estimated the insurance 
fund will decline by 10 percent from its 183 billion balance at 
the end of 1987 
any time you have to spend 4 billion it does give you pause 
but i believe this will be good for texas and i believe it is 
appropriate from the stand point of the insurance fund seidman 
said 
first republicbank the largest bank holding company in texas 
with 325 billion in assets posted a net loss of 23 billion for 
the first six months of 1988 
on june 30 it reported nonperforming assets or loans that 
arent being paid back of 513 billion more than 20 percent of 
its total loans outstanding negative net worth in assets minus 
liabilities was about 11 billion 
the deal catapults ncnb with 286 billion in assets from 18th 
largest bank in the nation to 10th largest now with about 50 
billion in assets it is an ambitious institution with a reputation 
as an aggressive commercial lender 
the fdic board comprised of seidman clarke and a third board 
member cc hope approved ncnbs offer late friday afternoon but 
the agency did not announce the rescue until 10 pm edt 
in the intervening time the fdic set off the complicated chain 
reaction necessary to declare first republicbanks subsidiaries 
insolvent it began with the fdics statement to the comptroller 
that it would not renew its 1 billion loan to the dallas holding 
company when it became due in september and ended with the 
comptroller an official of the treasury department and texas 
regulators declaring the 41 member banks insolvent and appointing 
the fdic as receiver 
first republicbank under its current charter was created in 
may 1987 when stockholders and regulators approved the merger of 
interfirst corp and republicbank corp creating at the time the 
nations 12th largest banking institution 
first republicabank stock which a year ago sold at above 26 
per share dropped by 25 cents a share to 75 cents friday in 
trading on the new york stock exchange

michael dukakis today ridiculed 
republican rival george bushs pledge to be an education 
president telling a kentucky rally the nation needs a president 
who will focus on education not just during election years 
dukakis the democratic nominee was wrapping up a sevenstate 
campaign swing today with appearances in louisville and raleigh 
nc he has stressed his message of economic opportunity throughout 
the trip and today focused on education as a vital part of his 
good jobs at good wages formula 
we need a president who will be out nations no 1 advocate 
for educational excellence not just for some of our children but 
for all of our children the massachusetts governor told an 
outdoor breakfast rally along the banks of the ohio river 
not just during election years but every year he said 
dukakis repeated his pledge to sponsor loanforgiveness and 
other programs to encourage college students to become teachers and 
his pledge to provide student loans to any high school graduate who 
is accepted by a college or university 
no youngster who completes high school and is qualified to do 
college work should ever be denied that opportunity because of 
financial need dukakis told the rally 
dukakis brought his campaign to kentucky after criticizing 
bushs day care plan and the reagan administrations handling of 
the pentagon scandal and slumping regional economies 
bush in turn challenged the democratic nominees contention in 
his acceptance speech last week that the race is about competence 
rather than ideology the vice president and certain republican 
nominee called such talk a ruse that just masks over his farleft 
philosophy 
bush also planned to hit hard on the issues where republicans 
consider dukakis the weakest foreign policy and defense when he 
goes on the road next week his campaign said 
dukakis was to take part of his time today to meet with 
candidates for state director posts in several southern states and 
also with supporters of vanquished rivals jesse jackson and 
tennessee sen albert gore jr 
another former rival illinois sen paul simon stood by 
dukakis side friday as the nominee addressed a rally in the 
illinois capital of springfield 
you need a partner in the white house a federal partner who 
will work with you who will not accept second best or second 
rate said dukakis accusing reagan of ignoring regions of the 
country whose economies are struggling 
dukakis joked about finishing behind simon and jackson in the 
illinois primary and urged those at the rally to vote democratic in 
november 
weve got to join together around some very fundamental values 
that unite all democrats unite all americans 
as he had earlier in the day in flint mich and sturtevant 
wis dukakis said laissezfaire management by the reagan defense 
department had contributed to the pentagon procurement scandal 
my friends in a dukakis administration were not going to 
surrender our national security to greed and corruption dukakis 
told the springfield rally were not going to use our defense 
dollars to line the pockets of washington consultants were going 
to pay for the tanks and equipment and training the men and women 
of our armed forces need and deserve 
earlier at a wisconsin news conference dukakis said bushs 
plan to give a 1000 tax credit to families who need day care was 
inferior to a democraticsponsored plan before the congress 
i dont know anyone who is serious about child care who thinks 
that makes sense dukakis said of the bush plan 
but he refused to endorse the 25 billion price tag the 
congressional bill carries 
bush appearing friday at a day care center in a washington 
suburb touted his program saying the problem is too diverse and 
complicated for a centralized agency to handle you have to have 
choice parental choice family choice and you have to have 
diversity he said 
bush also told reporters the issues in the presidential campaign 
are still all blurred out there right now 
the democrats had a good convention but offered no 
specifics bush said my opponents suggestion that ideology 
doesnt matter just masks over his farleft philosophy 
bush planned to go on the offensive next week with speeches in 
chicago on tuesday and corpus christi texas on thursday 
he will keep discussing issues and when the issues come in 
focus the polls will start closing campaign manager lee atwater 
said referring to the 18point lead dukakis has had over bush in 
polling since the democratic national convention 
at the white house meanwhile presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater accused dukakis of being for a weaker defense a 
contention that the dukakis campaign quickly challenged 
also on friday president reagan approved a 30day extension of 
secret service protection for jackson at a cost reagan estimated 
at 600000 fitzwater said the extension addressed jacksons 
concerns about threats against his life but would not last through 
the fall campaign

an upcoming report by a un team 
investigating chemical weapons in the iraniraq war is largely a 
devastating account of iraqi atrocities diplomatic sources said 
a un team of military experts planned weekend talks in 
baghdad the iraqi capital to work out details for a ceasefire in 
the eightyear persian gulf war the team conducted talks in 
tehran the iranian capital this week 
a second team investigating the situation of prisoners of war 
was to leave tehran for baghdad over the weekend 
on friday secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he 
still was unable to bridge differences between iran and iraq over 
the issue of facetoface peace talks 
iraq demands direct talks with iran before accepting a 
ceasefire iran wants a ceasefire first 
the secretarygeneral said he expects more meetings with both 
sides today 
both sides still are interested in a solution of the 
problem he told reporters after meeting separately with envoys 
from the two countries at un headquarters in new york they 
have a divergence which is only normal 
saudi arabia a major supporter of iraq and financier of its war 
with iran has joined the ranks of nations trying to pressure 
baghdad to compromise and agree to an immediate ceasefire 
diplomatic sources said today 
prince bandar bin sultan bin abdul aziz saudia arabias us 
ambassador met privately with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
and perez de cuellar on friday diplomatic sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the prince a member of the saudi 
royal family was trying to persuade iraq to drop its insistence on 
facetoface talks with iran before a ceasefire is declared 
the chemical weapons report detailing iraqs extensive use of 
the outlawed weapons is to be released monday diplomatic sources 
said on condition of anonymity they said the report would 
undermine iraqs position and mobilize international opinion 
against baghdad 
iraq has acknowleged the use of chemical weapons which are 
banned under the 1925 geneva convention but iraq contends iran 
introduced chemical weapons to the war 
in one of the latest claims of chemical warfare use irans 
islamic republic news agency today said iraqi forces chemically 
bombed a village just inside the border near the town of marivan in 
northwestern iran it said 10 civilians were injured 
after meeting friday with perez de cuellar foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati of iran said his country could consider direct talks 
with iraq after a ceasefire troop withdrawal and prisoner 
exchange he ruled out direct talks at this time 
tariq aziz later met the un chief for about 45 minutes and 
left without making a statement but middle east diplomats 
speaking on condition they not be identified said iraq had not 
softened its demand for direct talks 
perez de cuellar arranged the talks after iran announced last 
week after a years delay that it would accept a security council 
resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and setting out a 
peace plan 
details of the secretarygenerals proposals to iran and iraq 
have not been disclosed 
velayati said iran considered the proposal in general to be 
positive would study it further and respond officially today 
perez de cuellar also said friday he was very hopeful that 
us marine lt col william r higgins would be released soon by 
his captors in lebanon 
the un security council adopted a resolution friday condemning 
the february kidnapping of higgins and demanding his immediate 
release 
higgins head of a un military observer group was kidnapped 
by proiranian extremists but the security council resolution did 
not mention his abductors or their sympathies 
perez de cuellar already has raised the higgins case with 
velayati and asked iran to use its influence with the kidnappers of 
higgins and other american and foreign hostages 
iran and iraq have been at war in the persian gulf since 
september 1980 with the loss of about a million lives

critics and an associated press reporter western diplomats said 
today 
aung gyi who once was considered a likely presidential 
successor was among those seized during a roundup of dissidents 
late friday and early today said diplomats contacted in rangoon 
the burmese capital 
the reported sweep took place one week after burmese leader ne 
win resigned as chairman of the ruling party and set in motion

of economic and political conditions in burma the site of recent 
student unrest aung gyi targeted sein lwin new chairman of the

fact that sein win is a burmese not a us citizen she said

sein win was taken from his home in the northern suburbs of rangoon 
by authorities at around midnight friday the diplomats spoke on 
condition of anonymity

critical letters unprecedented in the rigidly controlled country 
although addressed to ne win and other burmese leaders the letters 
were widely circulated in rangoon and according to one burmese 
source sold like hotcakes

paradise he wrote in a may 12 letter the country has 
plunged to the bottom politically economically and socially the

he is widely said to have commanded brutally supressed student 
demonstrations in the capital earlier this year aung gyi giving 
gruesome detail of rapes and beatings claimed that 283 persons

here are the main goals of the peace plan for central america 
signed aug 7 by the presidents of costa rica guatemala honduras 
el salvador and nicaragua 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
negotiated ceasefires in nicaragua and el salvador which are 
both engaged in civil wars and in guatemala and honduras which 
are trying to suppress leftist insurgencies 
the conflicts in the four countries have claimed a total of 
nearly 200000 lives in the past decade 
amnesties for political offenders in all four countries 
nicaragua and el salvador have declared limited conditional 
amnesties for their political prisoners 
the plan does not clearly define to whom amnesty should be 
granted political prisoners armed opponents or both therefore 
application of amnesty differs in the five countries 
democratization defined by the plan as meaning full freedom of 
the press and other media and the right of dissident political 
groups to assemble and promote their views 
direct or indirect political repression continues in all the 
countries except costa rica which has had peace and democracy 
since 1948 
lifting of emergency or martial law at the time the plan was 
signed only nicaragua had such a law but amnesty international 
and other human rights organizations say restrictions on freedom 
were also enforced in the other countries through fear of execution 
by rightwing death squads or leftist terrorists 
an end to all outside aid to the regions insurgents until 
february the united states provided military and humanitarian aid 
to the contras battling the nicaraguan government which in turn 
receives military aid from soviet bloc countries el salvadors 
president jose napoleon duarte claims nicaragua is also channeling 
aid to leftists trying to overthrow his government 
an end to the use of any countrys territory by groups or 
individuals seeking the overthrow of a neighboring government this 
is aimed primarily at honduras where the nicaraguan rebels have 
maintained camps

millions of substandard bolts and nuts have 
been used in everything from military equipment and weapons to the 
space shuttle and commercial trucks a congressional committee said 
saturday 
the millions and perhaps billions of substandard fasteners 
used by our military and sensitive industries make it a wonder that 
we havent had a major catastrophe said rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and 
its investigations subcommittee 
a twoyearlong investigation by the subcommittee uncovered 
millions of substandard bolts nuts and screws many of them 
imported from japan and dingell said the problem could have 
wideranging effects 
for example 1200 m60 tanks were removed from army front lines 
for at least two months while defective bolts in the gun mounts 
were replaced and substandard fasteners were sold to the navy for 
use on both submarines and aircraft carrier jet catapult systems 
the panel said 
the fasteners contained more boron and less carbon than 
specified in industry standards making them more likely to break 
or shear the panel said 
as the report was being prepared dingell and 50 other house 
members introduced legislation to try to correct the problem 
the bill would require laboratory testing and greater 
documentation of fasteners to make it more difficult to substitute 
cheaper and less effective parts 
we must take steps to ensure that the fasteners sold to 
industry and government in this country meet the standards 
necessary to hold our products together said rep thomas j 
bliley of virginia ranking republican on the subcommittee 
the report said about 7 billion bolts and large screws are used 
annually by us industry including about 15 billion of the 
highstrength 80grade fasteners 
the pentagon has purchased millions of the bad bolts and is 
still trying to track them all down the panel said 
tests of fasteners purchased by the defense industrial supply 
center from a variety of lots showed a defective rate of more than 
30 percent the panel noted which would mean 30 million bad bolts 
in the 100 million 80grade fasteners purchased every two years 
the investigation by the army into the m60 tank problem found 
that screws in the gun mounts of 1200 tanks were substandard 
the screws proved to be defective and failed when the main gun 
was fired disabling the gun and threatening the lives of the 
crew the report said 
the army has also found substandard bolts on its m109 
selfpropelled howitzers mortar carriers personnel carriers tow 
missile carriers and a variety of trucks and other utility 
vehicles the panel said 
army officials told the panel last year they were working to 
correct the problem 
the navy has also run into problems the panel said at the 
request of the service shipyards last summer tested their stocks 
of bolts and found 58 percent were defective 
in one instance the defective bolts were scheduled to be 
installed in the aircraft catapults aboard the enterprise and the 
carl vinson two aircraft carriers 
problems have also turned up at the national aeronautics and 
space administration the panel found nasa has discovered broken 
and deformed bolts in the attach rings that hold the solid rocket 
boosters on the external fuel tank of the space shuttle 
in addition the nuclear regulatory commission has been aware 
of serious fastener problems in nuclear power plants for a number 
of years the report said 
the nrc doesnt think there is a radiation safety problem 
because of the defective fasteners the report added 
a number of criminal investigations of bolt suppliers are 
underway the panel noted for example the defense criminal 
investigative service and the customs service are conducting 26 
investigations 
the customs probes focused on importers who purchased 
substandard fasteners from japan the panel noted in addition 
other criminal investigations focused on fasteners built in japan 
korea taiwan and poland and shipped into the united states through 
canada

mikhail s gorbachev has demanded urgent action 
from top communist party officials to solve the daytoday problems 
of soviet citizens including lack of good food and hours wasted 
standing in line 
in our work we have become involved with many economic 
affairs while sometimes overlooking issues directly bearing on 
peoples lives the soviet leader acknowledged friday at a 
meeting of the communist party central committee 
his remarks were reported saturday by the communist party daily 
pravda 
gorbachev was quoted as telling the plenary session of his 
partys policymaking body that the government must act swiftly to 
better the lot of citizens 
the resolution of the highly important issues determining the 
living standards of the people is long overdue and the lag in that 
field has become chronic he said 
gorbachev has acknowledged that until ordinary citizens own 
lives improve many will remain unconvinced that his program for 
perestroika or economic and social restructuring is working 
at a national party conference that ended july 1 many delegates 
complained that gorbachevs ambitious economic and social reforms 
failed to put meat on store shelves or to improve the quality of 
goods 
in his speech friday gorbachev said the 13member ruling 
politburo had mapped out a proposed plan of action to improve 
food trade consumer goods and services that is everything 
that directly concerns people that is related to their daily needs 
and concerns 
he said even soviet defense industry plants should be made to 
produce consumer goods now in short supply 
to improve the chronically limited supply of food gorbachev 
called for urgent and cardinal measures both immediate and 
longterm 
bread and some other food products are abundant and cheaply 
priced in staterun soviet food stores but the selection of fruits 
and vegetables is far more limited than in the west and in some 
areas products like sugar and meat are still rationed 
gorbachev said it was possible to increase wholesale purchases 
of cattle and poultry by 25 million tons and milk by 43 million 
tons in 1990 the final year of a current fiveyear economic plan 
by that year he said the country could be producing enough to 
meet recommended dietary norms for its citizens in bread macaroni 
vegetables candy cereals potatoes butter wholemilk products 
eggs and poultry 
we wont be able to do so as regards meat and fruits in this 
period gorbachev noted but there too the situation could be 
mended seriously 
gorbachev directed some of his most poignant remarks at a 
problem that has longed seemed synonymous with soviet life long 
lines 
there are lines everywhere in trade in the service sector 
in transport in public health institutions and in organizations 
and offices which have to act on various requests of working 
people he declared 
when he visited a moscow shoe factory gorbachev said a mother 
of two who works there complained to him mikhail sergeyevich 
every day i have to spend two and sometimes even three hours 
queuing in stores this is exhausting i dont get as tired on the 
job as i do in the lines 
gorbachev said it was a shame that many highplaced officials 
calmly look at lines and do not deem it necessary to do anything to 
eliminate them this is nothing but a disrespectful and callous 
attitude to people 
reports carried by pravda and other staterun media on the 
central committee meeting did not specify what action the bodys 
more than 300 members took on gorbachevs proposals 
in his speech gorbachev also called for 
creation of a powerful consumer goods industry that would 
enlist the countrys militaryindustrial complex and heavy industry 
to produce 38 billion more in consumer goods than originally 
planned for 198990 
leasing of farmland to individuals for as long as 50 years so 
that peasants and not bureaucrats can take direct control of 
tilling the soil 
reduction of office space now occupied by government and party 
workers

as an outgrowth of the new era in 
sovietamerican relations the united states has been casting a far 
more benign eye toward moscows allies in eastern europe engaging 
in contacts that would have seemed impossible just two years ago 
for years washington tended to look on the east europeans as 
submissive step children of moscow with little room for maneuver 
either in their internal or external policies 
but since the advent of the gorbachev era in 1985 the reagan 
administration has been quietly expanding its contacts among east 
bloc countries especially poland and hungary 
these efforts bore fruit this past week with the first visit 
ever to washington by a hungarian communist party leader and the 
first in nine years by a polish foreign minister 
contacts elsewhere have been accelerating as well deputy 
secretary of state john whitehead who has been given special 
responsibility for eastern europe has visited each of the bloc 
countries at least twice 
the assistant secretary of state for european affairs rozanne 
ridgway has had a particular interest in eastern europe since her 
days as ambassador to east germany and has worked hard on 
developing closer ties with bloc countries 
there has been a more active dialogue with bulgaria lately but 
romania which once received special treatment because of its 
willingness to disagree with moscow has fallen from favor after 
renouncing a beneficial trade arrangement it had with the united 
states 
us relations with poland hit bottom in 1981 when the 
administration slapped on a series of sanctions after polish 
authorities imposed martial law the administration responded to 
gradual political liberalization by lifting sanctions one by one 
until the last of the measures was lifted in 1987 
we have normalized our relations foreign minister tadeusz 
olechowski said thursday after a meeting with secretary of state 
george p shultz he invited shultz to reciprocate his visit 
more noteworthy was the visit the previous day of hungarian 
communist party leader karoly grosz with president reagan grosz 
who was named to that post in may after serving as premier for the 
past year has done much to alter hungarys image as the hapless 
victim of soviet heavyhandedness reflected in the soviet armys 
crushing of an antisoviet revolt in 1956 
like mikhail gorbachev grosz is an advocate of economic and 
political reform to remedy hungarys economic problems winning 
plaudits from us officials for his daring departures 
we have been impressed with your openness to new ideas 
reagan told grosz on wednesday 
as grosz carried out his us travels it was sometimes easy to 
overlook his marxist underpinnings he spent 11 days on his us 
tour moving easily among business people and others while visiting 
california new york and illinois where he witnessed the signing 
of a 115 million joint venture between a us glass firm and a 
hungarian enterprise 
both poland and hungary are plagued by huge foreign debts and 
are eager for greater access to us markets but as warsaw pact 
allies of the soviet union their purchases of american products 
will have to be limited to nonstrategic items 
and although both poland and hungary give their citizens more 
freedom than other bloc countries both remain committed to 
continuing oneparty rule 
their military alliances with moscow appear to be very much 
intact at this point as well the soviets have 65000 troops in 
hungary and 40000 in poland 
still american officials are pleased with the evolution in both 
countries grosz in particular has a popular following for his 
willingness to expand the capitalist sector and to encourage more 
foreign private investment 
grosz said tuesday he is trying to establish something new 
something more modern something more efficient in the interest of 
developing the hungarian nation 
that same evening another moscow ally cuban president fidel 
castro made it plain that groszstyle economic liberalization is 
not for him 
we have to guard the ideological purity of our revolution 
castro said in a speech we cant use any method that smells of 
capitalism cuba will never adopt any method style philosophy 
or idiosyncrasy of capitalism

king hussein today signed a decree 
dissolving the lower house of parliament the official news agency 
petra said 
petra also said the king will deliver an important speech on 
sunday he is expected to outline jordans new policy toward the 
palestinians 
dissolving the chamber of deputies appeared to be another 
attempt to distance jordan from palestinian affairs in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip on thursday king 
hussein canceled a 13 billion development plan for palestinians 
in the occupied territories 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt during the 1967 middle east war half the 60 members of 
jordans chamber of deputies were from the west bank 
information minister hani khasawneh said a consultative 
council might replace the lower house of parliament within the next 
few days 
another jordanian official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said dissolving the lower house will give the palestine liberation 
organization greater responsiblity over west bank and gaza strip 
affairs 
this move is similar to the kings decision of a funding cut 
and we expecting other similar moves in the next few days the 
official said 
khasawneh said jordan intended to close all joint institutions 
with the palestinians including a joint jordanianpalestinian 
committee which finances educational and other services in the 
occupied lands 
he said jordans changing relationship with palestinians was 
aimed at avoiding friction between this country and the plo 
since december the occupied lands have been wracked by 
palestinian protests against israeli rule since the uprising began 
dec 8 more than 230 palestinians and four israelis have been 
killed leaders of the uprising are tied to the plo which helps 
finance the protests 
the lower house of jordans parliament was first elected in 
april 1967 two months before the middle east war it was suspended 
in 1974 following the rabat summit resolution which recognized the 
plo as the only legitimate representative worlds 5 million 
palestinians 
in 1978 a national consultative council composed of 80 members 
replaced the chamber of deputies in january 1984 a royal decree 
reinstated the lower house and it remained in session until today 
when jordan canceled the development plant government officials 
said the move was designed to hand over more responsibility for the 
15 million arabs in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to the 
plo 
meron benvenisti an israeli expert on the west bank said he 
thought the move was the first step toward a decision by king 
hussein eventually to cut ties with the occupied lands altogether 
he wants to see how people react but ultimately he has no 
choice but to cut ties benvenisti head of the west bank data 
bank a usfunded research project said earlier this week 
if he doesnt he gives money to people who in the long run 
are his enemies said benvenisti referring to a growing 
antijordanian slant among west bank palestinians 
palestinian leaders in the west bank were divided on the impact 
of the cancellation of the development plan some said it would 
seriously hurt residents already struggling financially because of 
the uprising 
israeli officials said the cancellation of the development plan 
would have no practical effect because it existed primarily on 
paper 
according to article 34 in the jordanian constitution the king 
has the power to dissolve the chamber of deputies a parliament 
with members from both side of the river jordan was originally 
conceived in 1950 when the late king abdullah king husseins 
grandfather united the two banks

washington ap international relief groups fear their feeding 
programs abroad may be reduced because the drought in the united 
states has driven up the cost of commodities they buy with federal 
aid 
while the severity of the cutbacks will become clearer after 
current supplies are used up possibly as early as december 
officials of the private voluntary organizations are concerned for 
the people they feed 
if prices continue to rise there will be some cutbacks 
says janice westcott senior program officer for the africa region 
at save the children westport conn save the children distributed 
168 million in food obtained under the federal grant program to 
people in ethiopia sudan and lebanon in the fiscal year ending 
june 30 says andy erish information officer 
enough food is being shipped or is on hand overseas to 
forestall trouble for save the childrens programs until february 
she says 
but rudy von bernuth director of programs for care in new york 
city says his agency may face very sharp reductions in the 
number of people fed or the quantity of rations as early as 
december 
individual rations might be reduced by up to 30 percent says 
george wirt director of public relations 
care shipped more than 300000 metric tons of grain to 11 
countries in latin america asia and africa and reaching more than 
20 million people says wirt 
it is sadly ironic von bernuth says that those who suffered in 
the drought in ethiopia and sudan may have to suffer now because a 
drought in the united states has pushed up prices of relief 
commodities 
the problem is more one of money supply than of food supply the 
officials say charities buy commodities with federal grants 
administered by the us agency for international development under 
title ii of the food for peace act 
as the drought pushed prices up the tonnage of commodities that 
could be purchased by the various agencies has fallen 
aid says in a statement that it is very concerned that 
overall commodities prices may be up to 10 percent higher than 
anticipated the agency is waiting for estimates from the us 
department of agriculture expected in midaugust 
a rule of thumb in measuring the possible impact of higher 
prices is that every 10 percent increase could cause a 100000 
metric ton reduction in aid says owen cylke aid assisstant 
administrator for food and voluntary assistance 
however he says the law requires aid to make available 19 
million metric tons of food in grant aid under title ii and aid 
will do so even if it has to ask congress for more money federal 
funding for title ii in fiscal 1988 which ends sept 30 is 684 
million proposed funding for fiscal 1989 is 595 million 
it would be wonderful if congress would consider additional 
appropriations but it seems unlikely says von bernuth 
a member of the house select committee on hunger rep byron l 
dorgan dsd disagrees 
with 5 million people facing starvation in ethiopia sudan and 
other areas it has to be a priority he says 
the outlook for food aid depends on whether recent rains in the 
american farm belt fell in time to save growing crops 
kenneth rozeboom a commodities trader with lackawanna products 
corp clarence ny says soybean prices rose sharply during the 
drought but have fallen with the rain and might even sink to 
predrought levels 
however rozeboom predicts corn prices will be higher by 20 to 
25 percent than had the crop been as good as it could have been

this city long branded one of the nations most 
segregated is also being labeled antisemitic as black leaders 
come under fire for failing to challenge the strident and widely 
publicized airing of simmering grievances against jews 
at the center of the controversy is former mayoral aide steve 
cokely who once claimed among other things that the aids 
epidemic is a result of doctors especially jewish ones who inject 
aids into blacks 
cokelys statements made during lectures before he held his 
city hall post did not gain widespread attention until the citys 
newspapers published them in april 
mayor eugene sawyer dismissed cokely five days later the delay 
dismayed chicagos jewish community but some black leaders rallied 
to cokelys defense saying his firing was outrageous and 
symptomatic of the power jews exert over blacks 
louis farrakhan who heads the chicagobased nation of islam 
said cokelys remarks offended jewish leaders because the truth 
hurts farrakhan whose group claims 10000 members gained 
attention with his own antisemitic stance in 1984 when he 
supported jesse jacksons first presidential bid 
only a handful of prominent blacks have come forward to denounce 
farrakhan or cokely 
from others has come a silence that has aggravated tensions 
between blacks and jews and brought the city under scrutiny 
recently in the new york times and the new republic and chicago 
magazines 
what the cokely incident really reveals is the unfortunate 
divisions that have occurred in chicagos black community since the 
death of mayor harold washington said clarence page a black 
columnist and an editor of the chicago tribune 
washington who had many jewish allies was the citys first 
black mayor and fought a long battle against white aldermen for 
control of the citys government 
sawyer also black was elected largely by antiwashington 
whites on the city council after washington died last year he 
hired cokely as part of his struggle to gain black support 
anytime a community feels itself under siege and divided its 
leaders embrace their own even when they are people they might 
otherwise want to distance themselves from page said 
this is one case where the community has behaved better than 
its leaders 
he noted that when the tribune polled voters after the cokely 
firing only 8 percent of blacks said cokely should have kept his 
job 
the traditional alliance between blacks and jews solidified 
during the civil rights movement has been strained by other 
statements incidents and divergent opinions in recent years 
among them are jacksons hymietown remark in referring to 
new york during the 1984 campaign and israels continuing sale of 
weapons to south africa 
chicago is neither more antisemitic than any other city nor 
more antisemitic than in the past in fact the black community is 
less antisemitic than its whites page said 
cokely himself has continued lecturing and did not respond to 
telephone requests for an interview last week 
on thursday an interracial group of ministers rabbis and 
civilrights leaders that has been meeting informally since the 
cokely incident called for more dialogue and stronger leadership 
civic and political leaders must move quickly and forcefully 
to denounce all expressions of antisemitism racism and other 
forms of bigotry to prevent them from gaining legitimacy the 
groups statement said 
to promote understanding the group announced a program of 
speakers to appear in churches and synagogues and stress the 
historic ties between blacks and jews 
chicagos jewish community supported washington in far greater 
numbers than other white ethnics and washington reciprocated 
many of his top officials were jewish but jews clearly have been 
upset by the cokely incident 
its impact likely was increased by other events a holocaust 
memorial in suburban skokie was defaced and windows were smashed 
at jewish shops and synagogues here on the 49th anniversary of 
crystal night when the nazis carried out similar attacks in 
germany 
past cooperation is evidently no guarantee of present 
understanding or future compassion said rabbi robert marx a 
member of the group 
do we speak for all jews and all blacks of course not he 
said there is much work to be done in both of our communities to 
build bridges and remove fences 
eugene kennedy a loyola university psychology professor argued 
in an essay in tuesdays new york times that the cokely affair has 
brought about the ugliest experience that the city has suffered 
in a long time 
he said some black politicians have shown a willingness to 
exploit the cokely incident to tap into what they identify as a 
current of antijewish feeling in their community 
theres no question about the fact that in the black community 
here there are strong negative feelings towards many jewish 
people said lu palmer an influential local radio commentator 
and selfdescribed black nationalist 
but whether chicago is worse than anywhere else i honestly 
dont know my suspicion is you wouldnt find much difference 
wherever you went

pacific beachgoers have had to contend with 
crud tar balls sharks and wildlifekilling plastic debris but 
they have not had to face the rats and syringes that have been 
washing up on beaches in the east 
we havent had any trace of medical waste dumping we have had 
none of that zero since i have been chief the past 12 years 
said ralph lopez deputy of environmental health and health 
facilities for the los angeles county department of health 
the only beach pollution trouble we have is if we have a 
breakdown in a power system or storm damage he said 
in densely populated california millions of gallons of 
untreated effluent have spilled into the sea in the past two years 
because of equipment failures or raincaused overflows at treatment 
plants 
such accidents add to the hot debate over waste disposal but 
actual beach closures have been rare 
a section of laguna beach in orange county was closed for most 
of last week when a pump broke dumping 36000 gallons of untreated 
liquid waste it was the latest in a series of spills including 
some last year from a sewage plant in mexico that forced the 
shutdown of miles of san diego beaches 
further north santa barbara county contends with tar and oil 
from offshore wells and natural seepage but recent years have seen 
nothing like the spills of the 1960s that killed hundreds of fish 
and birds 
you can see the oil slick come in a big long line of black 
oil and tar said mark bray a lifeguard supervisor for the state 
hundreds of miles to the north heavy rains cause untreated 
sewage to spill at ocean beach in san francisco about a dozen times 
a year and signs are posted warning against gathering shellfish 
which may have ingested bacteria 
meanwhile the shark population is rising because of increasing 
populations of protected sea lions and seals several fins have 
been spotted recently although no attacks were reported 
a more persistent problem in the north is debris washing up 
including several barrels of toxic chemicals several years ago 
and litter left by visitors 
scenic hawaii gets garbage dumped from large fishing boats but 
the islands isolation and strong sea currents help protect its 
beaches according to paul aki director of the state health 
departments pollution control branch 
plus we are responsible for our own trash we dont have a 
neighboring state that can dump garbage that will wash ashore 
here aki said 
in the pacific northwest and alaska abandoned fishing nets have 
trapped dozens of animals and other garbage kills fur seals and 
sea birds said brian boyle washington commissioner of public 
lands 
sea turtles will eat plastic bags thinking theyre 
jellyfish he said 
oregon has problems with discarded plastics and aluminum cans 
but has avoided much east coaststyle pollution because garbage is 
not dumped offshore and the states population centers are mostly 
inland said carolyn young a spokeswoman for the oregon department 
of environmental quality 
we do have driftwood washing up from logging operations 
occasionally she said

jorge diaz serrano former head of the 
government oil monopoly was freed from prison today after serving 
five years of a 10year sentence for fraud 
diaz serrano an exsenator left the southern penitentiary 
accompanied by his wife and two sons and maintaining his innocence 
as he has throughout the highly publicized case i am returning 
to freedom but not because there has been justice he told 
reporters 
a circuit court in march reduced his sentence to five years 
saying diaz serrano was not dangerous the supreme court upheld the 
reduction on july 18 
the cases of diaz serrano and former mexico city police chief 
arturo durazo moreno were centerpieces of president miguel de la 
madrids moral renovation campaign in the early 1980s 
diaz serrano was convicted in 1983 of defrauding the state oil 
company pemex of 34 million through the purchase of two natural 
gas tankers he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined the 
equivalent of 58 million 
diaz serrano headed pemex from 1976 to 1981 the oil boom years 
of former president jose lopez portillo after leaving pemex diaz 
serrano was elected senator from the northern state of sonora 
under the de la madrid administration congress stripped him from 
his immunity from prosecution 
his lawyer enrique mendoza morales said diaz serrano doesnt 
have the money to pay the 58 million fine but under mexican law 
cannot be held in prison because of his inability to pay 
mendoza morales said the government has confiscated about a 1 
million in assets from diaz serrano including property in the 
resort cities of cuernavaca and acapulco and an art collection 
the case of durazo moreno accused of extortion and illegal arms 
possession is still pending

the summer of 88 is already over in the minds 
of countless northeastern beach lovers revolted by a tide of dead 
rats syringes and sewage that has left miles of shoreline deserted 
and seaside businesses shuttered even on the hottest days 
they finally did it they ruined the beach said joe 
lovecchi of brooklyn he will limit his ocean dips to ankles only 
for the rest of the season 
others are not so brave attendance has plummeted at atlantic 
beaches since the scare began july 6 when needles and vials of 
blood some of which tested positive for the aids virus began 
washing up along long islands 120mile southern shore 
since then on beaches from new jersey to massachusetts 
lifeguards and rangers with rakes and rubber gloves have harvested 
gruesome garbage after nearly every high tide 
whoever did this is the typhoid mary of garbage carters 
said new york city parks commissioner henry stern this has 
ruined the summer for millions of people 
although health officials say chances of contracting aids from 
oceanborne waste are almost nil in new york officials are playing 
it safe when needles are found the beach is closed for at least 
two relatively clean high tides 
rhode island beaches remained open after syringes catheter and 
colostomy bags and intravenous tubing washed up last week 
scientists doing computer studies of ocean currents said the waste 
was probably dumped near new york in june 
medical waste is not the only reason beaches have closed 
beaches around asbury park nj were closed because of 
contamination from human waste which is a more potent threat to 
public health than hospital waste 
as in past summers high levels of fecal coliform bacteria also 
have forced beaches to close on long island and around boston 
harbor 
john rafferty a new york city lifeguard said he will enter the 
water only when his job requires it 
im not afraid of aids its just dirty water the waters 
been dirty for years i dont enjoy swimming in it he said 
you come out and you dont feel refreshed 
lovecchi has taken the same position why take a chance its 
not just aids but hepatitis a host of things he said if 
they opened up a stand selling clorox they could sell out to 
people who want to wash their feet 
bleach might sell but hot dogs and beers are not in demand at 
deserted beaches 
its real bad said wayne horner who operates the food 
concession at jacob riis park in queens where attendance is down 
from a million last july to 457000 this month horner said sales 
are down by twothirds nobodys coming out and theres nothing 
we can do 
fear and confusion did not prevent loli reyna of queens from 
taking her two young children to the beach last week 
if they get scared of the ocean now theyre never going to go 
in again she said nobody gets aids at the beach you use 
drugs and needles you get aids 
problems with sewage plants also have contributed to the beach 
crisis an old sewage plant in asbury park overflowed and dumped 
waste into the ocean the nearby town of bradley beach is now 
threatening to sue asbury park for lost business 
heavy rains are being blamed for drowning dozens of sewer rats 
that washed ashore in new york while they have determined that the 
rats didnt come from a lab officials havent pinpointed the 
source of the medical garbage 
its real possible all the material came from the same 
source said new york city sanitation commissioner brendan 
sexton there are particular outlets and people we are watching 
among lifeguards who frequently outnumbered sunbathers last 
week there was an almost fatalistic consensus tidal debris is not 
new and garbage of all kinds will continue to wash ashore as long 
as offshore dumping continues 
things have been washing up for a long time but aids is 
scaring people so much they are blowing it out of proportion 
said lifeguard george triffon

the chicago amp north western transportation co 
and its brakemen say it may take an act of congress to avert a 
strike that would idle farm belt boxcars and strand thousands of 
commuters 
lawmakers are considering legislation to keep the trains rolling 
the united transportation union said it will strike thursday if 
campnw adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1156 utu brakemen 
however neither side can act until a coolingoff period ordered 
by president reagan ends at 1201 am on aug 4 
in his order which also blocked an april walkout and created an 
emergency board to intervene reagan said a strike against campnw 
could deprive several midwestern states of essential rail service 
and disrupt business in the chicago area where 40000 commuters 
use its trains daily 
negotiators for the company and clevelandbased union met last 
monday and tuesday at national mediation board headquarters in 
washington but made no progress as of friday no further talks 
were scheduled 
for almost two years weve been planning how we would operate 
in the event of a strike said james foote vice president of 
communications for cnw corp in chicago the railroads parent 
company were ready 
they didnt get what they wanted so they dont intend to talk 
and intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on aug 4 
utu president fred hardin said if they take that position that 
leaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service 
on july 1 the presidential emergency board proposed a 
compromise that campnw eliminate one brakeman per train and the 
other if approved by an arbitrator on a trainbytrain basis both 
sides rejected the plan 
the railroad operates on 6400 miles of track with 8000 
employees in illinois iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri 
nebraska south dakota wisconsin and wyoming 
it ranks eighth among us railroads in revenue generating 
8935 million last year by moving 17 million carloads of freight 
weve cut our work force cut expenses and improved our 
productivity dramatically foote said but because of 
competition and lower rates our revenue per car has declined 26 
percent since 1982 
campnw wants to save 51 million a year by cutting most of its 
train crews from four to two people eliminating what it considers 
unnecessary brakemens jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor 
on board 
weve made agreements in good faith with all the other 
carriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and one 
brakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman said 
hardin whose union represents both brakemen and conductors if 
campnw were to win we have a strike and theyre victorious then 
theyd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads 
foote said it might take an act of congress to bring a 
settlement a sentiment echoed by hardin but neither the company 
nor union want a solution being proposed on capitol hill they have 
spent the last few days lobbying against it 
a bill introduced by rep john porter rill would make the 
presidential boards recommendations binding unless the parties 
reach agreement without a strike 
the chairman of the house energy and commerce committees 
transportation subcommittee rep thomas a luken dohio said the 
measure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement by 
thursday 
this would be a crippling strike for commuters and many 
agricultural interests especially in these droughtstricken 
times luken said its premature for us to consider any action 
unless and until there would be a strike but we intend to be in a 
position to move very quickly 
hardin said he was not sure yet if the utu would extend a strike 
to other carriers and he did not know if campnw employees from 15 
other unions would walk off the job in sympathy 
if its a legal strike our people would said jim shell 
vice president of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers in 
cleveland thats a matter of personal choice whether a member 
crosses their picket lines or not but this organization 
traditionally has honored legal strikes

a strike by 9000 northwest lumber workers 
has silenced dozens of logging operations and sawmills in five 
states and could last into the fall union and company officials 
say 
monday marks the eighth week of the strike with no settlement 
in sight and the continuing threat that thousands more may join the 
walkout 
workers are demanding restoration of wages and benefits cut two 
years ago when the companies were struggling to get out of an 
industrywide recession the unions reluctantly accepted cuts after 
losing a series of strikes 
union leaders say their members deserve to share in record 
profits many of the companies have posted in the past two years 
company officials say they cannot restore wages and still compete 
with smaller nonunion mills 
we went from an industry dominated by national companies with 
branches in oregon to plant closures and mills bought and 
reopened by small independents said cathy baldwin willamette 
industries inc a portlandbased manufacturer of paper and wood 
products 
these people opened these facilities with nonunion labor 
paying substantially lower wages than we do were in a position 
now of competing with these smaller independents that have a 
substantial advantage over us in labor costs 
eight woodproducts companies including some of the regions 
largest have been struck in oregon washington idaho montana and 
northern california since contracts expired may 31 
the large companies which used to bargain as a group have 
decided to bargain separately and union officials say each company 
wants to stonewall until they see what their competitors do 
there will always be strikes in this industry until they can 
get their act together said bill hubbell president of the 
international woodworkers of americaus one of the striking 
unions 
company officials say that while profits have been up most of 
those earnings have come from paper products not wood products 
baldwin said willamettes plywood prices have dropped 17 percent 
since 1986 while the cost of logs has nearly doubled 
several companies have offered bonuses tied to productivity 
increases they argue that bonuses give them more flexibility in a 
cyclical industry 
the unions say their members are asking just to make what they 
earned in 1985 the industrys average starting wage in 1985 was 
1075 an hour today its 918 said brad witt a spokesman for 
the other striking union the western council of industrial workers 
as the strike has dragged on however the unions have offered 
to consider a combination of bonuses and wage increases 
the unions have targeted six large companies willamette boise 
cascade corp champion international corp simpson timber co 
daw forest products inc and wi forest products inc the western 
council also has struck two smaller companies lakeview lumber co 
and a door plant operated by morgan products ltd 
the unions have threatened to strike weyerhaeuser co the 
regions largest woodproducts company with 6000 union workers in 
oregon and washington but arent ready to move yet 
keeping weyerhaeuser running has an effect of the same 
strategy of the automobile unions when they strike only one company 
at a time hubbell said they take ford out and the others 
work and pretty soon ford gets upset with their customers buying 
chrysler or general motors products 
the strike has reduced production by 75 percent but there have 
been no shortages said malcolm epley vice president of the 
western wood products association a portlandbased industry group 
were not really feeling any problems because demand has been 
off the markets been soft epley said the situation might 
change if more workers go out he said

drug questions dominate a bitter contest for an 
atlanta congressonal seat with the incumbent admitting he 
considered using laundered drug money to finance his home and a 
challenger saying he might consider legalizing drugs 
rep pat swindall a twoterm republican whose philosophy is 
largely in tune with that of the religious right is unopposed in 
his partys aug 9 primary 
the frontrunner in a threeway democratic contest for the seat 
in the affluent 4th district is widely considered to be ben jones 
who played mechanic cooter on the dukes of hazzard he took 47 
percent of the vote against swindall in a 1986 challenge 
jones has acknowledged telling a young democrats meeting at the 
university of georgia in may that he might consider legalizing 
drugs but he added that he told the group that would be an option 
only after a massive effort to truly eradicate drugs 
jones has complained that his views have been distorted and his 
campaign ads stress his opposition to drugs 
one of his opponents lawyer nick moraitakis who has been 
campaigning for more than a year said the remark was irrational 
irresponsible and ridiculous 
john stembler a theater operator and lastminute entry in the 
democratic race said he intended to hit the drug question hard in 
tv ads before the primary 
jones said he doesnt think the charge that he is soft on drugs 
will hurt his chances the truth always comes out and i think 
this tactic backfires he said 
swindall 37 an atlanta lawyer and businessman won the 
congressional seat in 1984 by defeating democratic rep elliott 
levitas the election turned in part on swindalls charge that 
the incumbent talked a conservative game at home but voted with the 
liberals in washington 
in office swindall has stressed his ties with his church and 
frequently sided with the religious right on issues such as 
abortion 
but a 12500squarefoot 1 million house he built has cast 
dark clouds over his political career 
first there was bad publicity about liens filed against the 
property for unpaid bills swindall said the money should have been 
paid by the contractor 
then an atlanta businessman with whom he discussed a mortgage 
loan was indicted by a federal grand jury on moneylaundering 
charges 
swindall was called to testify before the grand jury in february 
and told reporters at the time he returned a 150000 check from 
the businessman charles lechasney because he was concerned that 
lechasney and another man later identified as an undercover 
internal revenue service agent were trying to use him to launder 
money 
however a government videotape the contents of which were 
obtained by reporters showed swindall continued pursuing an 
850000 loan even after being told it might be financed with drug 
money until he was informed by the undercover agent that a 
gobetween could not be used and that swindall would have to accept 
the proceeds in person and sign a receipt 
the congressman told supporters he was embarrassed and 
ashamed of dealing with the men but that he did not violate the 
law because he ultimately did not take the money 
i entertained things that were illegal and i entertained 
things that were wrong he said in june but i thank god i 
rejected the loan 
jones 47 said he isnt focusing on swindalls problems 
im just going to keep on doing what ive been doing talking 
about the issues the differences between he and i and trying to 
take the highest road possible his other problems are simply 
there and i dont intend to talk about them jones said 
swindalls campaign consultant robb austin said the loan 
consideration will be a factor in the election but added this is 
a conservative district and pat without question has represented 
the views in the district

burmese authorities have arrested up to 
25 people including a prominent critic of the authoritarian 
government and an associated press correspondent us officials 
and other diplomats said saturday 
the arrests came less than a week after sein lwin a former army 
general known for ruthless suppression of dissidents replaced ne 
win as president and chairman of burmas sole political party 
in washington state department spokeswoman nancy beck said us 
officials in burma understand that perhaps as many as 25 people 
have been arrested within the last 24 hours 
she said those arrested included retired brigadier general aung 
gyi a longtime critic of ne wins authoritarian regime 
ms beck and western diplomats in burma said ap correspondent 
sein win was also among the arrested 
in a brief message telexed to the associated press bureau in 
bangkok the journalists family said daddy has been taken away 
he wont be available to answer your queries the message was 
received at 1258 am 
the 70yearold aung gyi once regarded as a probable successor 
to ne win had written a series of letters attacking economic and 
political conditions in burma he had targeted sein lwin 
criticizing his role in the bloody suppression of student protests 
analysts in burma had predicted aung gyi would be silenced in a 
society where public dissent has been stamped out swiftly in the 
past 
the 66yearold correspondent formerly publisher of the 
englishlanguage daily the guardian was jailed for three years in 
burma in the 1960s in connection with his journalistic activities 
he joined the associated press shortly after his release in 1968 
in 1963 he was awarded the golden pen of freedom by the 
parisbased international federation of journalists for his work in 
fostering a free press in burma he also served on the executive 
board of the international press institute and founded burmas 
first national news agency 
aung gyi a former military colleague of ne win sided with the 
former leader during the 1962 military coup that overthrew the 
civilian government he then served as vice chairman of burmas 
revolutionary council and minister for trade development and 
industries 
but the pragmatic liberal aung gyi quarreled with ne wins more 
radically socialist supporters over plans to nationalize the 
economy he resigned from his positions in 1963 and was 
subsequently jailed 
an owner of several tea and pastry shops in rangoon the burmese 
capital aung gyi recently reemerged in the public eye through his 
letters although addressed to ne win and other burmese leaders 
the letters were widely circulated in rangoon and according to 
one burmese source sold like hotcakes 
addressing ne win as bogyoke or general aung gyi refrained 
from attacking his former superior personally but he sharply 
criticized those around ne win as well as the general state of the 
country 
that the country has gone from bad to worse 26 years after 
the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fools 
paradise aung gyi wrote in a letter may 12 the country has 
plunged to the bottom politically economically and socially the 
moral decay is the most deplorable 
letters dated june 8 and july 19 attacked sein lwin for 
turning a blind eye to all kinds of human rights violations 
the new leader is widely believed to have commanded forces that 
brutally supressed student demonstrations in the capital in march 
aung gyi giving gruesome detail of rapes and beatings claimed 
that 283 people died the government has acknowledged 43 deaths 
including 41 who suffocated in a crowded police van after their 
arrests 
aung gyi was sharply criticized at a party congress last week 
where ne win offered his resignation after 26 years in power ne 
win cited the unrest as one reason for steppig down 
about a third of his speech was devoted to detailed allegations 
that aung gyi blew up the student union building at rangoon 
university during a 1962 protest 
western sources have said ne win himself ordered the building 
destroyed during the protest in which troops commanded by sein 
lwin gunned down 22 protesters 
following unrest in the capital in june that spread to other 
burmese cities and towns the government closed virtually all 
universities and other academic institutions they are scheduled to 
reopen next month

tibet when he met with chinas foreign minister in march just 
after the renewed violence in lhasa tibet is indefensible asia 
watch said in its second report on the issue in half a year 
washingtons silence has enabled the government of china to 
maintain policies in tibetan areas that go against the grain of 
prevailing american sentiment on internationallyrecognized human 
rights and against the provisions of us laws that embody those 
sentiments the report said 
us government inaction combined with chinas decision to 
bar with a few scattered exceptions the international media and 
concerned observers from tibet has contributed to the creation of 
a climate in which the abuse of rights can proceed with little 
regard for international opinion international norms or 
international obligations which china has accepted 
the state department said it had not seen the asia watch report 
and would not comment 
the united states recognizes tibet in a remote himalayan border 
region as part of china asia watch said it takes no stand on the 
issue of independence for tibet 
when chinese foreign minister wu xueqian visited washington last 
march the only real problem that the administration seems to 
have perceived in sinoamerican relations was chinas position 
in the persian gulf war including its sales of silkworm missiles 
to iran asia watch said 
an apparent decision not to take up the tibetan issue with wu 
was particularly unfortunate it said because wu visited 
shortly after march riots in tibet that were far more serious 
than the fall disturbances in the tibetan capital which had at 
least managed to elicit some concerned comment from the 
administration 
the evidence strongly indicates that human rights conditions 
in tibet have deteriorated since last fall government brutality in 
the march violence seems to have exceeded the level of violence 
during the fall the number of arrests seems to be higher the 
torture in prison continues 
the report noted that when chinese vice premier tian jiyun 
visited the white house and state department last may again there 
was no indication that the administration made any attempt to 
broach the tibetan issue 
asia watch quoted reports from various sources that as many as 
50 people died after daylong rioting involving up to 10000 
tibetans in street battles with security forces on march 5 the 
last day of a great prayer festival in lhasa the tibetan capital 
rep tom lantos dcalif cochairman of the congressional 
human rights caucus said the report confirmed information the 
caucus has been receiving since the unrest began last year in tibet 
improved uschinese relations while in the interest of both 
countries cannot occur in the face of continued chinese 
violations of tibetan human rights lantos said 
the chinese authorities must understand that just as the 
american people have insisted on the observance of human rights by 
the soviet union as a condition of improved ussoviet relations 
so chinese observance of tibetan human rights is a precondition for 
further improvement in uschina relations

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address delivered from camp david md 
my fellow americans what a moment of hope it was one year ago 
when central american leaders concluded their meeting in guatemala 
a sandinista government of nicaragua a communist regime 
fighting a civil war against 15000 nicaraguan freedom fighters 
opposed to their oppression agreed to a series of sweeping 
democratic reforms if carried out those reforms would have ended 
the killing and brought peace to nicaragua and central america it 
would also have meant that nicaragua would have last joined the 
family of free democratic nations 
at first there were a few hopeful signs to much media fanfare 
the opposition newspaper in nicaragua la prensa was reopened 
independent radio stations were allowed to broadcast again a few 
political prisoners were released and political groups were 
allowed more latitude most important sandinistas finally agreed 
to the freedom fighters request for direct negotiations for a 
peaceful democratic settlement 
now the main reason the sandinistas agreed to those steps a 
year ago was the steady progress of the freedom fighters including 
important battlefield victories like the one at los minos but 
tragically t the very moment when continued strength and 
determination by the united states might have meant the continued 
success of the peace plan the united states house of 
representatives decided and by only a very narrow margin to 
refuse my request for further effective aid to the freedom fighters 
this of course removed the principal prod the military 
victories and popular success of the freedom fighters to sandinista 
participation in the peace plan and sent an immediate signal of 
american weakness to the communists 
this failure to support the freedom fighters has had costly and 
sad consequences just how costly and sad weve seen during the 
past few weeks communist sandinista leader daniel ortega has been 
visiting castro in cuba and voicing solidarity with the tyrant who 
has brought so much sadness and misery to that country while in 
nicaragua a renewed attack on political descent is being led by 
the head of the secret police tomas borge a dedicated communist 
and grim hardened repressor of human rights whose office 
according to our commission on organized crime has also been 
actively engaged in the international drug trade 
acting under the orders of the communist leaders and borges 
supervision sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken 
up a peaceful demonstration by 3000 nicaraguans opposition 
leaders were jailed or beaten and now sentenced to prison 
political religious liberties have again been curtailed the 
communists ordered the catholic archbishop to shut down the 
catholic radio station and for almost two weeks the independent 
newspaper la prensa was refused permission to publish and the 
american ambassador was expelled and yet while the cutoff of aid 
to the freedom fighters was a dreadful mistake getting the cause 
of peace and freedom back on track not recrimination must now be 
our goal 
there is a chance for a real bipartisan consensus in support of 
renewed contra aid indeed one of its strong supporters has 
recently been named to be the vice presidential candidate of the 
democratic party 
senator bob dole intends soon to offer legislation to renew 
effective assistance to the freedom fighters the final details are 
being worked out and i urge the members of the senate to support 
the aid package and i also asked the house of representatives to 
move speedily and favorably on the senate legislation 
meanwhile we continue to pursue aggressively our diplomatic 
efforts with the central american democracies so much is at stake 
a few years ago there were those who said the cause of freedom 
and democracy was lost in el salvador well perhaps some of you 
remember that incredible scene when the people of that country 
defied communist threats and bullets to march to the polls and vote 
for democracy the american aid package that helped make democracy 
victorious in el salvador passed by only two votes in the house 
but pass it did and democracy did come 
a few weeks ago both vice president bush and i visited the 
bedside of one of the heroes of that struggle president duarte of 
el salvador president duartes had no easy life he has been 
continually threatened by extremists of both left and right his 
daughter was kidnapped by communist guerrillas 
and now while in a desperate struggle with cancer he continues 
to lead his nation on the high road to democracy and i cannot tell 
you how deeply moved vice president bush and i were by our visit to 
this brave and remarkable man and how determined we both were that 
his dream for his people and all the peoples of central america 
should be made a reality the dream of peace and freedom for every 
man woman and child 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

technicians stopped a hydrogen leak 
and fixed a balky oxygen pump saturday and nasa said it would 
resume a countdown on sunday leading to the testfiring of space 
shuttle discoverys main engines 
a countdown leading to the critical test was halted early friday 
when the problems developed and the firing was postponed three 
days from monday until thursday 
officials believe the engine test delays combined with an 
unresolved leak in discoverys steering thruster system will slip 
discoverys launch date from midseptember into october 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone reported saturday that technicians 
traced the hydrogen leak to a nut on a pressure monitor hose 
repaired it and detected no further leakage she said the pump 
problem was caused by two corroded control switches that were 
replaced 
she said tests would continue to verify the changes and that the 
launch team planned on sunday to resume a countdown demonstration 
test in which discoverys huge external fuel tank will be loaded 
with half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen 
that count is to continue until 7 am monday when a mock 
liftoff will be scrubbed with 10 seconds to go because of a 
simulated problem the launch team then will empty the tank 
restart the count and refill the tank leading to the 20second 
ignition of the three main engines thursday 
the filling of the tank had barely begun when the troubles with 
the hydrogen and oxygen systems cropped up friday both are in 
ground support equipment and not on the shuttle itself 
the postponement was the fourth for the testfiring in 10 days 
the firing is to check several modifications made to the shuttle 
engines and is considered essential for certifying discovery for 
the first shuttle launch since the loss of challenger and its 
sevenmember crew in an explosion on jan 28 1986 
engineers have come up with a scheme for getting access to the 
steering system leak on the launch pad by cutting a hole through 
the aft bulkhead of the shuttles cargo bay that would delay the 
launch an additional two weeks 
another option to be made after the testfiring is to take 
discovery off the pad and back to a hangar for repair a move that 
could put off the launch until november

a senior politicians insulting remarks about 
american blacks have once again touched off debate over racist 
sentiments in this country 
michio watanabe policy chief of the governing liberal 
democratic party suggested that american blacks frequently use 
credit cards but care little about paying their bills 
among those guys over there america are a lot of blacks and 
so on who would think without concern were bankrupt now we 
dont have to pay anything back watanabe said july 23 to party 
members 
the senior politician is widely believed to aspire to the 
premiership 
watanabe made the comments at a time when japanese advertising 
for consumer goods often portrays blacks only as sexy dancers and 
good athletes suggesting a widespread patronizing attitude 
the us embassy said it deplored any disparaging comment 
that consciously or unconsciously uses demeaning stereotypes of 
any american to make a point 
watanabe apologized saying two days later that he regretted his 
misleading and inadvertent comments 
the sogo department store in tokyo also drew fire recently for 
displaying mens clothing on two black mannequins in dance poses 
with crossed eyes and huge red lips 
there was absolutely no intention of creating any racist 
display said the stores deputy manager hideo kinoshita to 
us they were lively and energetic we just put suits on them in 
what we thought was a tasteful display 
the store dismantled the mannequins after two weeks as planned 
and does not intend to put up other such displays in the near 
future kinoshita said 
sanrio a major gift manufacturer had sold since 1985 a pair of 
black dolls named sambo and hanna the company also markets 
bibinba a wideeyed black doll with a redlipped grin 
there were no racist sentiments behind them said sanrio 
spokesman kazuo tomatsu our corporate policy is to promote love 
and friendship but some people found these products offensive so 
we have canceled their production 
the move will cost sanrio about 115 million tomatsu said 
sanrios annual sales are 615 million 
takara japans no 2 toymaker also makes dakkochan an 
inflatable black doll with big eyes and red lips it was japans 
topselling toy when introduced in 1960 so takara made it its 
corporate logo japanese still buy 100000 of them a year 
we didnt consider it a black person it was just a cute 
doll says takara spokesman shusuke kubota black was popular 
then and at that time harry belafontes banana boat song was a 
big hit he said the firm had received no complaints 
the japanese embassy in washington reported receiving several 
phone calls of protest after photos of the mannequins and reports 
of watanabes comments were published in the united states 
watanabes apology was the second he made to a foreign country 
in february he told china he was sorry for saying that people in 
remote shanxi province have dug themselves into pits and are 
still living there 
watanabes gaffe recalls former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasones remark in 1986 that the us intellectual level was low 
because of the large numbers of blacks puerto ricans and mexicans 
many japanese were shocked at the negative international 
response to nakasones remarks 
a typical response was its true whats the problem with 
saying it but nakasone subsequently issued an apology to the 
american people 
earlier this year seisuke okuno was fired from his cabinet post 
as director general of the national land agency for saying japan 
was not an aggressor in world war ii but fought to protect 
itself at a time when the white race had turned asia into a 
colony 
kuniko inoguchi professor of international relations at tokyos 
sophia university says the japanese may have felt submissive 
at the time since most of the american troops occupying japan 
after world war ii were white 
but in terms of fashion blacks are in and stylish in 
japan miss inoguchi said its similar to how japanese were 
once stereotyped by americans bucktoothed with glasses and 
slanted eyes most japanese simply lack awareness of black 
identity 
the japanese fashion of blacks as stereotypes was reinforced 
last year after the popularity of a book by eimi yamada for soul 
music lovers only which won a prestigious literary prize 
japanese companies have regularly used black athletes 
including ben johnson carl lewis and mike tyson to endorse 
products and several professional baseball teams have signed up 
black players 
but japan has only reluctantly admitted outsiders 
to the japanese anyone who is not japanese is a gaijin or 
foreigner the word means more than just outsider it means not 
japanese a taunt japanese schoolchildren can throw at anyone who 
does not belong 
many japanese politicians including nakasone claim that japan 
is a homogenous race undiluted by mixing with outsiders and pride 
themselves on that fact without realizing its racist implications 
the newspaper asahi shimbun called this a misguided belief 
almost all countries of the world have some sort of minority 
problem and are trying to resolve them through trial and error in 
sharp contrast japan is embarrassingly warped in its attitude to 
this issue the paper said in an editorial

west germany outdistanced the united states as 
the worlds biggest exporter for the second year in a row 
according to the international monetary fund 
west german exports amounted to 294 billion compared with 250 
billion for the united states and 231 billion for japan in 1987 
the imf said 
west german exports which first jumped ahead of us exports in 
1986 also ran ahead of us exports for the first two months of 
1988 467 billion for west germany compared with 459 billion 
for the united states 
us imports in 1987 were 424 billion compared with 228 
billion for west germany 158 billion for france 154 billion for 
britain and 151 billion for japan 
the imf figures in an imf publication released friday show 
total trade increased 10 percent in 1986 and 18 percent in 1987 
the fund reported that trade among the biggest countries 
remained far out of balance in 1986 and 1987 the united states 
imported much more than it exported while the reverse was true for 
japan and west germany 
the imf said us sales grew by 152 percent and purchases by 
96 percent in 1987 over the year earlier while japans exports 
rose up 93 percent and imports were up 182 percent and germanys 
imports and exports each grew by about 20 percent 
both japan and west germany have been undr international 
pressure especially from the united states to increase their 
imports and curb their exports 
last years total trade marked a return to the annual average of 
the 1970s the publication noted 
the imf said trade within the european economic community 
increased at substantially higher rates in 1986 and 1987 than 
overall trade within industrial countries 
the trade of developing countries also grew substantially 
reversing the stagnation of the previous three years it added 
the fund includes among developing countries its other 131 
members many of them poorer lands where incomes have declined 
like much of africa and latin america as well as more prosperous 
countries where conditions are improving such as south korea and 
singapore

authorities say the shooting death of a 
boyishlooking 17yearold ends the criminal career of a drug 
dealer and hit man who may have been involved in 10 murders but 
his mother says police have it all wrong 
rakie cloyd gunned down thursday night at a housing project 
with four shots to his back and the back of his head was best 
known to police as a killer for a richmond drug dealer said 
homicide detective ct woody 
seven homicides that he probably was the shooter in 10 
homicides that he was involved in woody told the richmond 
timesdispatch sometimes hed stand and tell somebody else to 
kill them 
he was small and quiet just sitting in the courtroom you 
would think he was a little kid said assistant commonwealths 
attorney learned barry im afraid hes kind of the wave of the 
future our killers are getting younger and younger all of the 
time 
woody said cloyds age and appearance belied his criminal 
character 
he would definitely hurt you woody said he would do what 
his superiors told him to do and not care they told him to kill 
and he never really seemed to mind 
but cloyds mother barbara taylor said her son was a high 
school student who excelled in football and basketball 
he wasnt with no bad crowd of people ms taylor said in an 
interview at her apartment friday i wouldnt be living here if 
my son were a dope dealer 
theyre trying to make my son look like a monster or an 
animal she said i dont care i know the kind of person my 
son was a loving person 
police maj v stuart cook said that in february 1987 cloyd 
killed herbert l cunningham 20 with 17 shots from an uzi 
submachine gun cloyd was charged as an adult with murder but the 
charge was dismissed after a key witness failed to appear in court 
cook said he is considering asking prosecutors whether to 
consider some of the 10 slayings cleared meaning authorities 
believe they know who is responsible for the crime and the suspect 
is either dead or in prison 
woody said he and his partner had told ms taylor that they 
thought her son had killed several people and that he might be 
killed himself 
she said we were wrong woody said she said we had the 
wrong person he got a lot of support at home the family got angry 
with us 
barry said police were not the only people who expressed concern 
about cloyds activities 
barry said that on may 20 when he had to request that the 
cunningham slaying charge against cloyd be dropped circuit judge 
james b wilkinson lectured the defendant 
this is the first case i can remember ever where the judge 
took the time to tell him either clean up your act or youre going 
to get killed barry said 
because of cloyds age his juvenile court records are sealed by 
law but one of the prosecutors for richmond juvenile and domestic 
relations court expressed familiarity with cloyds past when told 
of his death 
we were expecting it last year said assistant 
commonwealths attorney pat bell im surprised he lasted as long 
as he did im really sorry it happened but im not surprised 
police said they have no suspects in cloyds death

a vault containing the hope diamond popped 
open saturday after being stuck shut for four days hiding one of 
the smithsonian museum of natural historys most popular 
attractions 
crowds gathering around the 444 carat blue diamond acquired by 
the museum in 1958 were confronted with a printed sign saying the 
diamond could not be displayed 
museum officials said they believe the timer on the vault 
holding the diamond may have malfunctioned 
mechanics are looking at it and the men that maintain the 
safe are checking it out museum spokesman tom harney said we 
should be able to tell next week what went wrong 
the vault opened shortly before the museums 10 am scheduled 
opening saturday harney said the diamond is kept behind a thick 
layer of bulletproof glass covered by a heavy nontransparent door 
that a timer opens so the gem can be displayed 
the museum had trouble with the safe once before in 1967 but 
that problem was resolved when museum officials discovered that a 
substitute guard had simply forgotten how to make it open 
despite the possibility the vault could jam shut again museum 
officials said they were locking up the priceless gem at the close 
of business saturday

mindful of geraldine ferraros illfated vice 
presidential quest in 1984 michael dukakis had aides accompany 
sen lloyd bentsen on his first campaign solo flight 
the 67yearold bentsen is no stranger to campaign work and the 
silverhaired senator took several of his own aides with him on the 
campaign foray to california nevada new mexico and texas last 
week 
officials in both the dukakis and bentsen camps remember how 
ferraro walter f mondales running mate four years ago hit the 
campaign trail unprepared and want to closely coordinate campaign 
activities 
mrs ferraro badly mishandled the controversy surrounding her 
husbands finances and the issue quickly destroyed any momentum 
the democrats had following their nominating convention in san 
francisco the ticket went on to lose 49 of the 50 states to ronald 
reagan 
they put her out basically without any senior help from the 
mondale campaign said francis obrien who had been called in to 
help rescue the ferraro campaign and was on the bentsen plane last 
week 
four years ago there was a lack of communication between the 
two campaigns he said people who went through that experience 
learned from that experience 
obrien led a cadre of dukakis people on the bentsen plane 
including tad devine the dukakis chief delegatecounter before the 
convention who will coordinate and direct the senators campaign 
from the dukakis headquarters in boston devine also worked for 
mondale four years ago 
but bentsen also will keep a group of his longtime advisers 
with him to handle daytoday issues 
weve done a very good job of integrating the dukakis staff 
said joseph oneill a former bentsen aide on capitol hill who 
will become his top traveling campaign staffer 
a formal announcement of the campaign staff is planned later 
this week said jack devore bentsens spokesman 
bentsens campaigning was kept at a deliberate pace last week 
with careful staging of each event 
his speeches were cautious citing his senate record on issues 
of interest to each audience and working in some digs at the reagan 
administration but avoiding harsh attacks 
care was also taken to emphasize areas where he and dukakis 
agree 
while the bentsen choice is certainly a lot less daring than 
mondales ferraro decision bentsen and dukakis probably have more 
disagreements on policy bentsen is much more conservative on some 
issues including his opposition to gun control support for aid to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels and school prayer 
the political message for the trip was found mostly in the 
locations which were designed to highlight the dukakis campaign 
theme of aggressively going after electoral votes that the 
republicans have controlled for years the democrats last won texas 
in 1976 and havent won new mexico nevada or california since 
1964 
bentsen a supporter of the equal rights amendment found a 
friendly audience with a businesswomens group in albuquerque he 
played a come home to the democratic party theme to a union 
audience in san francisco in nevada and at his texas stop in 
amarillo a republican area thats home to his opponent in this 
years senate race rep beau boulter 
as permitted by texas law bentsen is running for the vice 
presidency and the senate at the same time 
the trip hit two areas a day instead of the threeaday planned 
for later in the campaign 
as a statewide campaigner in texas the national campaign isnt 
as big a step up for bentsen as it was for ferraro a member of the 
house from queens ny bentsen also has the experience of his 
unsuccessful 1976 campaign for the democratic presidential 
nomination 
the senator said that from his viewpoint its gone very 
well and he was surprised he didnt face a sea of bush signs at 
his rally in amarillo 
i think we could have done a few more things he said but 
we wanted some time in there in case things werent working out 
the trip was cut short by a day when the campaign canceled a 
planned visit to mississippi because of a conflict with dukakis 
schedule 
bentsen returned to washington where he plans to immerse 
himself in a heavy senate schedule including action on the trade 
and plantclosing notification bills 
dukakis aides said bentsens congressional schedule was a plus 
even though it will cut into his campaign time one aide said it 
provides meat and potatoes for the democratic effort 
bentsen says he expects to campaign in texas the south and 
southwest but aides say its still to be decided how the 
candidates time will be apportioned 
thats going to be a part of the discussion as the campaign 
begins to nail down staffing and strategy in the next few days 
oneill said friday 
on the road bentsen said he was encouraged by the large number 
of local officials who want to appear on the dais with him and 
dukakis when they hit town 
aides said that kind of reaction is a good indication of the 
level of local support

an afghan resistance leader said 
saturday that guerrilla attacks in afghanistan are delaying the red 
armys withdrawal and he urged the rebels to hold off on the raids 
and let the soviets leave 
radio kabul reported that rocket attacks killed at least five 
people in the eastern afghan city of jalalabad it blamed the 
attacks on moslem guerrillas 
the saturday report monitored in pakistan said 34 rockets 
blasted the city about 75 miles east of kabul afghanistans 
capital it said 11 people were injured 
if the soviets are really withdrawing and not bringing 
problems and harm to the areas they are withdrawing from they 
should let them go resistance leader burhanuddin rabbani told 
the associated press i believe the soviets should go sooner and 
we should not stop them 
under terms of a unmediated accord signed april 14 the 
soviets began withdrawing their troops from afghanistan in may and 
are to have them all out by february the red army entered 
afghanistan in 1979 to support the government in its war with 
antimarxist guerrillas 
rabbani said the soviets hesitate to withdraw from a post 
when guerrillas begin to apply pressure because they dont believe 
the afghan army can survive alone so they are making their 
withdrawal movement slower than before he said

embassies to reduce staff and encourage dependents to leave the 
country in a single week in midjuly as many as 200 rockets 
blasted the capital said western diplomats 
britain plans to evacuate 10 of its citizens from afghanistan 
this week because of fears of increased guerrilla attacks on kabul

a nineday national festival spotlighting black 
artists opened saturday featuring a play by pulitizer prize winner 
charles fuller that examined the sometimes bitter experience of 
freedom for former slaves 
the world premiere of fullers latest effort sally took 
place friday night at the alliance theater in an unofficial 
kickoff to the first national black arts festival 
the festival formally began saturday with a parade through 
downtown atlanta an artists market a folk arts festival an 
african puppet show the second performance of sally and a 
production of sisters by atlanta playwright marsha jackson 
hundreds of thousands are expected to attend more than 100 
events showcasing black artists in eight disciplines theater 
folk arts dance film and video music visual arts literature 
and performance art 
sally produced by the negro ensemble company is the first 
of a fivepart series that fuller is planning on the slaves 
introduction to freedom fuller has worked with the company before 
their most noted collaboration was a soldiers play which won 
the pulitzer prize in 1982 
sally centers on a black regiment of the union army 
stationed in beaufort sc during the civil war the soldiers 
runaway slaves initially are attracted to the yankees by the 
promise of freedom but they soon learn that freedom will not bring 
equality 
a recurring theme of the play is the soldiers pay it is 10 a 
month for white soliders but congress cuts the blacks to 7 
the inequity causes them to ask if a black mans life is worth 
less than that of a white and leads the plays male lead sgt 
prince logan to make an agonizing choice between whether to stick 
with his angry men or with a general who wants to impress 
washington with a show of unity 
but the unity has long been broken by the pay issue one black 
soldier vendross played by ol duke screams at his comrades 
the only difference between slave and free is pay niggers 
douglas turner ward a cofounder of the negro ensemble company 
who directed sally and also plays the role of prince said his 
focus lately has been solely on the play despite his involvement 
in organizing the festival 
ward said he expects sally and one of the next installments 
in the series to debut in new york later this year he expects to 
be off stage by then 
i really consider myself pinchhitting as an actor i dont 
consider my performance as a pinchhitting performance but my 
intention is as we add the second play im going to try someone 
else as prince he said 
ward said one of the main attractions of sally to him was 
its portrayal of the different ways that people approached their 
freedom 
the interesting thing about the play is for the slaves its 
their first taste of freedom ward said they know what slavery 
is but they dont know what freedom is except theoretically and 
thats what this play captures the complexity of responses 
sally was warmly received by about 600 people who attended 
the opening night performance at the 800seat theater

britain plans to evacuate 10 embassy workers and 
their dependents from afghanistan this week because of fears of 
increased guerrilla attacks on the capital of kabul the foreign 
office said saturday 
it has advised 98 other people to leave the country that 
includes 45 britons and 53 citizens of other countries which

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address given by sen carl levin 
of michigan 
im pleased that the senate and the house have passed drought 
relief legislation this is an important first step in addressing a 
situation that threatens americas farmers and affects every one of 
us 
but today i want to talk abut two other bills passed by 
contgress ono i want to tell you why 
the first of these is the defense bill president reagan 
requested about 300 billion in spending for the nations defense 
in 1989 the senate and the house approved the total amount the 
president asked for but we differed with the president on just how 
we should spend that money to make the nation more secure 
as in the past president reagan overemphasized nuclear weapons 
and star wars at the expense of our conventional forces he also 
proposed actions which would make effective arms control harder to 
achieve and maintain 
let me give you an example president reagan requested almost 5 
billion for st ar wars a 24 percent increase over last years 
level at the same time he proposed cutting the armys ammunition 
purchases by over 10 percent those are the wrong priorities they 
waste money on redundant nuclear weapons and exotic space weapons 
research while shortchanging needed conventional capabilities that 
would make nuclear war less likely 
that is why congress rearranged the spending priorities in the 
bill we held star wars spending at last years level and used the 
savings to increase spending on needed army ammunition and initiate 
a program to develop new weapons that can stop modern soviet tanks 
we also placed limits on how star wars funds can be spent to 
ensure that the united states does not violate the antiballistic 
missile treaty we signed with the soviets the last thing we need 
is a new arms race in space especially while we are trying to 
conclude a treaty that would cut both sides existing nuclear 
arsenals by 50 percent 
unfortunately a few of his advisers urged president reagan to 
veto the bill congress passed and to go back to his original 
defense priorities that was bad advise after all even his own 
secretary of defense and national security adviser supported the 
bill 
another important bill which deserves the presidents support is 
the legislation which requires companies employing 100 or more 
workers to give 60 days notice prior to a plant closing or a major 
layoff 
president reagan concedes the notifying of workers who are about 
to lose their jobs is the humane thing to do 
but president reagan says that he thinks that providing notice 
to workers should be voluntary but of course it already is 
this bill isnt aimed at companies that are going to do the 
decent thing anyway it is aimed at companies like one i know in 
michigan that told its workers on a friday afternoon that they 
were being laid off for two weeks 
but then over the weekend workers living near the plant saw it 
being dismantled its machinery carted off on flatbed trucks 
that is how 130 workers discovered they were losing their jobs 
of that number 45 had been with the company between 30 and 40 
years 
worst of all the plants owners knew that they were going to 
shut it down for the previous six months they intentionally kept 
their employees in the dark intentionally kept them from making 
the plans necessary for cushioning the blow and starting anew 
the advance notification bill would prevent human tragedies like 
that it would also give workers and the states and towns in which 
they live one final chance ot try to save the plant from closing 
down and these are reasons the president should support it 
one more point governor dukakis supports this bill and pushed 
through a similar law in massachusetts but we havent heard from 
vice president bush on this bill where is george 
most americans favor this advance notification bill but does 
vice president bush 
these two bills the 1989 defense bill and the plant closing 
notification are very different but taken together they advance a 
goal we all share security and dignity for all americans and for 
our country 
thank you

a quip attributed to the late sen everett 
dirksen a billion here a billion there pretty soon youre 
talking about real money is coming painfully true for federal 
bank regulators 
the 4 billion rescue of first republicbank corp of dallas and 
the closing and rescue of other banks this year will cause the 
government insurance fund that backs deposits in commercial banks 
to suffer the first loss in its 54year history 
add in billions of dollars being spent to assist the even more 
troubled savings and loan industry and it means real money 
enough to hamper the governments fight to curb the massive federal 
budget deficit 
money spent by the federal deposit insurance agencies the 
federal deposit insurance corp for the nations 13500 commercial 
banks and the federal savings and loan insurance corp for 3100 
savings institutions does not come from taxpayers at least not 
yet both the fdic and the fslic derive their money from an 
assessment on member institutions 
however revenue to the funds counts as a government receipt for 
federal budget purposes when spending exceeds receipts it 
inflates the budget deficit projected by the administration to hit 
1523 billion for fiscal 1988 
so far this year fslic has had two multibilliondollar 
transactions it spent 2 billion to help southwest savings 
association of dallas take over four smaller institutions in may 
and 13 billion a month later to close two severely insolvent sampls 
in costa mesa calif 
fslic is looking at spending 13 billion to 2 billion more 
early this fall on irvine califbased financial corp of 
america the nations secondlargest thrift holding company 
its unknown if the fdic faces any other big expenditures but 
analysts have been watching the efforts of mcorp another large 
dallas bank to pull itself out of its hole by attracting 
additional investors 
according to a congressional aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity budget watchers earlier this year were worried that 
federal spending on sick financial institutions could trigger 
automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts under the grammrudman 
deficit reduction 
stronger than expected tax collections in may and june have 
eased the concern for now 
still the white house office of management and budget in a 
midyear budget review released thursday boosted its estimate of 
fdic spending this year by 17 billion and by 12 billion in 
1989 the estimate for fslic was increased by 29 billion for 1988 
and 17 billion for next year 
fdic chairman l william seidman in announcing the first 
republicbank rescue late friday night told reporters he expected 
the fdic to suffer its first loss since its founding in 1934 
until now revenue from banks and interest on investments has 
always outweighed whatever it spent to protect depositors in 
failures and forced mergers 
even in 1984 when the fdic bailed out continental illinois 
corp of chicago with 45 billion in the largest rescue ever the 
agency made money but all bank failures only totaled 79 in 1984 
this year they are expected to equal or surpass the 
postdepression record of 184 set in 1987 
seidman said the fund which stood at 183 billion at the end 
of 1987 would likely lose close to 2 billion this year but he 
cautioned thats a best guess and the loss could go higher 
when you forecast you often get into trouble and your 
crystal ball ends up looking like ground glass he said 
the effect of the wave of financial institution failures on the 
budget several years down the road could be even more pronounced 
fslic which is technically insolvent is in even worse shape than 
the fdic and faces more severe problems 
and unlike the fdic fslic in its assistance packages is using 
notes rather than cash obligating it to pay billions of dollars as 
much as 10 years in the future 
the federal home loan bank board fslics parent agency says it 
expects to have just enough money over the next 10 years to pay the 
309 billion cost of closing or merging insolvent sampls 
however private analysts put the price tag as high as 75 
billion and the house and senate banking committees are already 
debating about the prospects for a taxpayer bailout in order to 
fulfill the governments obligations to depositors

after nearly eight years of conflict on 
the battlefield iran and iraq seemed locked in dispute at the 
united nations last week over iraqs demand for facetoface talks 
before a ceasefire 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who brought the 
foreign ministers of the two countries to new york last week 
insisted the obstacles to an accord were merely procedural he said 
he hopes to announce a ceasefire date sometime this week 
but despite the secretarygenerals optimism progress has 
appeared slow and halting 
movement toward the current talks began july 18 when iran 
reversed a yearlong stance and said it would accept a un 
resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire 
the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans spiritual leader said 
opting for peace without victory and overthrow of the iraqi regime 
was like swallowing poison 
the bitter broth was sweet news to the international community 
but it fueled iraqi suspicions that iran was insincere and only 
sought a temporary truce to rebuild its forces 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz insisted there could be no 
ceasefire or further negotiations without first holding 
facetoface talks which he says would offer proof of irans 
sincerity 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati rejected the demand 
he said friday there would be no direct talks before a ceasefire 
and rejected what he called iraqs efforts to delay a peace 
settlement 
the issue was further complicated saturday with remarks by 
irans deputy foreign minister ali mohammed besharati who told a 
news conference in abu dhabi that iran would participate in direct 
talks if perez de cuellar asked it to 
here is where the un talks stand now 
points of agreement 
both sides unconditionally accept resolution 598 a 10point 
plan including an immediate ceasefire and troop withdrawal a 
prisoner exchange formal peace talks and a commission to determine 
which side was the aggressor in the war 
both agreed to hold immediate separate talks with the 
secretarygeneral on implementing the resolution they agree the 
secretarygeneral will set dates for the different phases of the 
plan 
a team of un military experts has visited both capitals to 
work out details of a ceasefire and another is investigating 
prisonerofwar issues in both countries 
points of disagreement 
iraq insists on direct talks in new york before a ceasefire 
while iran rejects direct talks at this time 
iraq also demands that before a ceasefire goes into effect 
iran promise not to attack iraqi and neutral shipping in the 
persian gulf it also calls for the united nations to dredge the 
disputed shatt alarab waterway the southern boundary between the 
two nations 
iran will make no commitments on these issues 
participants 
perez de cuellar a 67yearold peruvian diplomat perez de 
cuellar is known for diligence and determination rather than 
dynamism he is the first latin american to hold the post of 
secretarygeneral now in his second fiveyear term he is 
considered a patient skillful negotiator 
iraqs tariq aziz appointed in 1981 as foreign minister the 
51yearold aziz is a longtime colleague of president sadam 
hussein in iraqs baath party he sometimes is referred to as 
husseins righthand man 
aziz a christian is considered one of the most eloquent 
spokesmen of the iraqi government 
irans ali akbar velayati a 43yearold pediatrician velayati 
trained at johns hopkins university in maryland in iran he has 
been active in establishing relief centers and clinics 
in 1977 velayati denounced the shah and was arrested for 
antigovernment activities he was active in welcoming khomeini to 
iran and later was named by khomeini as his representative for 
national reconstruction 
since tuesday perez de cuellar has met five times with velayati 
and three times with aziz talks are scheduled to begin again

secretary of state george p shultzs 
trip to central america this week has angered leaders of the 
leftist sandinista government 
the state news media called shultzs planned meeting in 
guatemala city monday with the foreign ministers of el salvador 
honduras costa rica and guatemala another example of us 
aggression against nicaragua 
nicaragua was not invited to attend the meeting at which shultz 
is expected to endorse a statement of principles on what is 
needed to get a central american peace plan moving again 
the plan drawn up by costa rican president oscar arias is 
aimed at negotiating an end to the war in nicaragua and leftist 
guerrilla wars in el salvador and honduras 
the sandinistas claim nicaragua has made the most progress in 
complying with the plan even though they say the united states 
violated the spirit of the accord this year when it approved 
nonlethal aid to the contra rebels fighting the nicaraguan 
government 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco and other leaders say 
honduras still tolerates the presence of contra camps in its 
territory and both el salvador and guatemala have failed to get 
truce negotiations under way with their guerrilla foes 
no one is fulfilling the plan but nicaragua tinoco said in 
a recent interview it has turned into everyone picking on what 
nicaragua does we insist all actors and factors accept their quota 
of responsibility 
the sandinistas concede that of the five central american 
countries nicaragua made the greatest effort to reach agreement 
with its insurgents because it had the most to gain influencing 
congress to end us aid to the contras 
but tinoco pointed out the peace plan was signed by five 
countries and is binding on all 
this was a promise by five countries not just nicaragua 
tinoco said adding that the sandinistas have made great efforts to 
negotiate with contra leaders something they had vowed they would 
never do 
the sandinistas signed a ceasefire agreement with the contras 
march 23 which has often been violated talks for a permanent truce 
broke down june 9 
the government also lifted a national emergency law suspending 
individual freedoms in force since the us began supplying aid to 
the rebels in 1981 it loosened restrictions on the opposition 
press and released about 1000 of an estimated 4000 political 
prisoners

conservative lawmakers on saturday denounced new 
york mayor edward koch for retracting his remarks that britain was 
playing a positive role in northern ireland 
any man who makes a strong statement and because of political 
pressure changes his mind is not worth the office he holds said 
terry dicks a conservative member of parliament he koch is a 
weakkneed politician who has to look over his shoulder to see 
where his votes lie 
koch apologized to new yorkers of irish descent friday for the 
unfortunate use of language in his statement regarding the 
british role in northern ireland he said he was wrong to suggest 
that the british are not an occupying army in northern ireland and 
he urged a timetable for british withdrawal from the province 
what i meant to convey was that there has been a modest change 
in the british role in northern ireland a change which ought to be 
encouraged the mayor said 
koch said through a spokesman saturday having been called to 
task by those who are more familiar with the facts because they 
have a greater understanding of these 800 years of oppression i 
chose to do what any honorable gentleman should do admit my error 
correct the record and say what i believe to be the truth 
his original remarks made wednesday after a visit to the 
province were praised by british prime minister margaret thatcher 
if more people came with an open mind and looked at what is 
happening we would have many others making similar remarks 
she told the house of commons on thursday 
members of her governing conservative party objected to kochs 
apology 
conservative lawmaker robert adley said i regret the naivity 
of any british politicians allowing themselves to be taken in by 
visiting americans who are remotely likely to understand the 
situation or to be able to comment positively in the unlikely event 
that they do understand it 
what mayor koch and his creepycrawly colleagues in new york 
should realize is that most of the protestants have been in 
northern ireland far longer than they have been in america he 
said 
adley added if there are to be any occupying armies 
withdrawn it is the whites who should get out of the united states 
and hand the country back to the red indians 
lawmaker barry porter said one must believe that what mayor 
koch said when he got back from northern ireland was what he really 
felt about the situation 
he is now trying to do a political houdini and i do not think 
he will succeed i regret what he has now done 
koch was in ireland on a sixday peace pilgrimage led by new 
yorks roman catholic cardinal john oconnor on wednesday after 
he returned to new york koch said he accepted the british army as 
a peacekeeping force rather than an occupying army in northern 
ireland 
the almost exclusively catholic irish republican army is 
fighting to push the british out of the protestantdominated 
province join it with the republic of ireland and set up an 
allireland socialist state

secretary of state george p shultz will 
try to mend a yearold central american peace plan now in tatters 
when he meets here this week with four of the regions foreign 
ministers 
shultzs initiative appears aimed at increasing diplomatic 
pressure on nicaraguas sandinista regime and encouraging four 
other countries to pursue a negotiated settlement to the areas 
conflicts 
on monday the foreign ministers of guatemala honduras costa 
rica and el salvador but not nicaragua will present shultz with 
a statement of principles the central american leaders agree 
are needed to achieve peace nicaragua was not invited to the 
meeting 
the secretary of state is expected to endorse the principles 
which have not been released publicly before continuing on a 
nineday trip to argentina uruguay brazil and bolivia to discuss 
south american problems with the leaders of those countries shultz 
is then to return to meet with the presidents of costa rica el 
salvador and honduras 
the peace plan signed aug 7 1987 by guatemala costa rica 
el salvador honduras and nicaragua came apart when the leaders in 
january failed to extend its deadlines and abolished an 
international commission named to verify progress 
instead they vowed to keep working together toward peace 
but another meeting of the five presidents to review the plans 
progress tentatively scheduled for aug 7 has been shelved 
indefinitely 
el salvador still is in the midst of a bloody guerrilla war a 
fragile ceasefire in nicaragua is broken almost daily and leftist 
insurgencies still smolder in honduras and guatemala only costa 
rica is at peace 
there are signs that the united states is finally seeking a 
more active diplomatic role in the regional process and that could 
revive the peace process said deane r hinton the us 
ambassador in costa rica in a recent interview 
he added that the united states is seeking a new policy toward 
nicaragua which has not been fully defined 
congress has said we cant pursue our interests the way the 
president wanted to pursue them hinton said referring to 
congressional rejection of president reagans last request for aid 
to the rebels 
if he reagan cannot provide the contras the weapons that 
they ask for to win their cause then well have to try to find 
political ways to bring peace and democracy to the area hinton 
added 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua apparently anticipating 
that shultz will urge the foreign ministers to condemn the 
sandinista government for its failure to live up to the peace plan 
recently called for reactivation of the international commission to 
verify progress of the plan 
ortega said his fellow central american presidents were 
unqualified to judge the plans progress because they themselves 
had failed to live up to it 
the plan was conceived and promoted by president oscar arias of 
costa rica who in december won the nobel peace prize for the idea 
the arias plan sets deadlines for compliance with negotiated 
ceasefires amnesties democratization an end to outside aid to 
insurgents and the use of one countrys territory by rebels from 
neighboring nations all were to be defined and achieved by nov 7 
1987 a date that came and went with only minimal compliance 
arias who once said he would be the first to condemn those who 
did not adhere to the deadlines said in january that the peace 
process should not be measured by a calendar 
in the months after it was signed the plan did bring some hopes 
of peace in the region but the hopes were quickly stilled by 
events 
the governments of el salvador and guatemala conducted talks 
with leaders of their leftist guerrilla movements but no progress 
resulted 
the honduran government claimed contra camps did not exist 
inside its territory and that it had no armed opposition an 
attitude sharply challenged by recent terrorist attacks on us 
servicemen stationed in that country 
nicaragua allowed the reopening of the opposition newspaper la 
prensa and a roman catholic radio station freed some of its 
political prisoners lifted the national state of emergency and 
began talks with the contras something the sandinistas said they 
would never do 
but the talks which broke down in early june produced only a 
temporary frequently broken ceasefire that has been extended 
through august the two sides remain at an impasse on the question 
of a permanent peace in their 7yearold civil war 
the sandinistas say they cannot support greater democracy until 
the contras lay down their arms and rejoin nicaraguan society but 
the rebels insist democracy must be instituted in nicaragua before 
they will give up fighting 
in the meantime both sides have hardened their positions 
the contras elected a new more conservative leadership to guide 
them the sandinistas closed the catholic radio station 
indefinitely and shut down la prensa for 15 days they also jailed 
dozens of contra leaders while expelling us ambassador richard 
melton and seven other american diplomats

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk said saturday that chances for peace in his country are 
very slim but vietnams foreign minister said peace talks last 
week broke an impasse in the conflict 
foreign minister nguyen co thachs optimistic comments on the 
talks in indonesia were reported by the official vietnam news 
agency 
sihanouk who spoke to reporters after arriving in beijing from 
bangkok blamed both vietnam which backs the cambodian government 
and the khmer rouge the largest group in the threeparty 
resistance coalition for blocking peace efforts 
sihanouk said the khmer rouge was the biggest obstacle to a 
settlement of the 9yearold cambodian conflict but he said the 
khmer rouge would have to be included in a future cambodian 
government 
you cannot reject them nobody is capable of wiping out the 
khmer rouge so we have to try to make them less and less dangerous 
by including them in a quadrapartite government he said 
thach who attended the meeting of cambodias warring factions 
in bogor indonesia said the talks ended amid bitter clashes but 
also some convergence of views 
in an interview with the vietnam news agency thach said that 
for the first time all parties in the conflict agreed that the two 
pivotal issues in resolving the conflict were the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops from cambodia and eliminating danger from the 
khmer rouge 
the talks included cambodian prime minister hun sen and 
representatives of the resistance as well as vietnam laos and 
representatives of the sixmember association of southeast asian 
nations 
sihanouk also met last week with representatives of the warring 
factions in jakarta indonesia the prince who last month resigned 
as president of the threeparty resistance coalition did not 
attend the peace talks in bogor 
he said before departing from indonesia on friday that the talks 
had been a success 
but when asked about the prospects for peace after indonesia he 
said they were very slim thats the reason why i am going to 
meet again with hun sen in paris in october 
he said that if the four warring factions including hun sen 
agreed that vietnam should end its military occupation of cambodia 
vietnam would have no pretext to stay in cambodia 
vietnam has pledged to withdraw its estimated 120000 troops by 
1990 but has demanded that the khmer rouge be disarmed and not 
play a role in a future cambodian government 
the prince said in his meetings with government official in 
beijing that he would not make any demands on the chinese who 
supply the khmer rouge with military and financial support 
at the talks in indonesia all parties agreed for the need to 
put into place a political solution to end a conflict which began 
in 1979 following the vietnamese invasion of cambodia since then 
the threeparty resistance including the khmer rouge has been 
fighting hanois forces and the government in phnom penh 
but thach has opposed proposals for an international armed force 
that would disarm the warring factions including the khmer rouge 
who some fear will return to power once hanois forces are 
withdrawn 
only the cambodian people victims of the genocidal khmer 
rouge clique can disarm them he said in the interview no 
foreign force whatever can disarm the pol pot force 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to end the khmer rouges 
three years in power during which they killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians

the foreign ministry said saturday 
that the decision to pay damages to the family of a leftist student 
who disappeared while in police custody is not an admission of 
guilt 
it issued a statement saying the payment would be made out of 
respect for the interamerican court of human rights 
the court on friday after eight months of hearings and 
deliberations ruled that honduras was responsible for the death of 
student leader angel manfredo velasquez 35 and must pay damages 
to his family 
presidential spokesman lisando quesada refused to say how much 
the government would pay 
two witnesses in the case were shot to death in january and 
human human rights groups blamed the killings on rightist death 
squads 
velasquez was a student at the national universitys college of 
economics when police arrested him sept 8 1981 during the 
military government of gen policapo paz garcia 
he was never seen again 
student and labor organizations protested his disappearance 
several armed groups briefly invaded radio stations newspapers and 
news agencies to demand an investigation 
the ruling was the first by the court an organization of 
american states agency its seven international jurists are hearing 
other cases of central americans who disappeared while in police 
custody or allegedly suffered human rights abuses 
the foriegn ministery statement said the government did not feel 
the evidence produced in the velasquez trial proved honduras was 
guilty in the disappearance it said it hopes its dignified 
example will be an incentive to other nations to adhere to human 
rights accords and accept the jurisdiction of the court 
honduras independent human rights commission says 150 people 
have disappeared in honduras after being picked up by security 
forces over the past eight years and about 800 people have been 
slain in political killings 
amnesty international the londonbased rights organization 
reported in february that death squads linked to the honduran 
military are waging a new campaign of torture and terror against 
government opponents 
amnesty said arbitrary arrests and torture of prisoners are 
widespread 
honduras returned to civilian rule in 1982 after a decade of 
military governments but president jose azcona hoyos civilian 
administration remains dependent on the support of the armed forces

democrat michael dukakis blamed the 
reagan administration saturday for the pentagon contracting uproar 
quoting an old greek saying that the fish rots from the head 
first 
it starts from the top the democratic presidential nominee 
said 
dukakis stepped up his assault on president reagan and vice 
president george bush his certain republican opponent in the fall 
at a stop in louisville ky where he spoke to about 5000 people 
at a large outdoor rally in a downtown plaza 
dukakis was concluding a sevenstate tour with stops in two 
tobacco states kentucky and north carolina before returning home 
to boston saturday night 
bush who is pondering the selection of a running mate and 
awaiting nomination at the republican national convention in new 
orleans in two weeks did not campaign saturday 
in chicago jesse jackson said his unsuccessful presidential bid 
was a victory for americas disenfranchised opening the political 
process and blazing a trail that would lead one day to a black 
occupying the white house 
in his first public appearance since the democratic national 
convention in atlanta jackson told an overflow gathering at 
operation push the civilrights organization he helped found 
jackson also called dukakis

a 
viable alternative to bush 
jackson drew a hearty ovation when he said dukakis pledged to 
not bring shame to the white house bush does not recognize shame 
at the white house 
dukakis attacked sharply on the pentagon procurement problem 
when questioned about this at a news conference following his 
louisville rally with kentucky gov wallace wilkinson and sen 
wendell ford 
dukakis said the alleged bribery and other abuses in connection 
with the awarding of defense contracts seemed to be 
fundamentally a problem of people rather than process the 
reagan administrations approach to public service was to blame he 
said 
if youre going to have an administration that takes integrity 
and honesty and effective management seriously that begins at the 
top he said if an administration comes to washington with a 
contempt for public service we shouldnt be surprised that the 
people it attracts in government share that contempt who look at 
government service as something that you do for a year and a half 
or two before you go out and make a half a million dollars 
asked if he blamed reagan and bush personally for alleged 
misdeeds by pentagon contractors consultants and administrators 
dukakis responded 
theres an old greek saying and i suspect the italians have 
the same one you know the fish rots from the head first it 
starts from the top 
the son of greek immigrants dukakis frequently uses greek 
phrases and speaks in greek before audiences with similar 
backgrounds 
under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning 
contracts worth billions of dollars 
dukakis had attacked the republicans on the pentagon problem in 
speeches through the midwest a day earlier saying he would not 
surrender our national security to greed and corruption 
at the news conference he said he did not expect the president 
to know everyting going on in his administration but he said if 
the president picks good people and moves quickly to dismiss any 
who violate ethical standards this kind of problem is less 
likely to fester and grow and become almost an epidemic in your 
administration which is whats happened 
dukakis also jabbed at bush in his speech saying if elected he 
would be our nations no 1 advocate for education not just 
in an election year but every year 
that was a reference to bushs claim to want to be the 
education president 
while in kentucky a state dependent on both coal and tobacco 
dukakis expressed support for greater use of coal for producing 
electricity he also voiced support for the federal tobacco price 
support program in its current form which is designed to support 
itself from fees charged to farmers and said he supported using 
general tax dollars to compensate tobacco growers hit by drought 
when asked about tobacco however dukakis first replied by 
saying he would try to get his wife kitty to rid herself of the 
habit of smoking he quickly added im just kidding 
dukakis also repeated his vow to make no concessions to 
terrorists to gain release of hostages such as those being held in 
lebanon the consequences will be incalculable he said 
you use diplomacy but you never ever make concessions he 
said 
later in raleigh nc dukakis spoke to about 4000 people 
inside a sweltering state fairgrounds arena and repeated the themes 
he stressed throughout his sevenstate threeday campaign swing 
investing public and private money to create new jobs improved 
education and affordable child care for working parents 
he called for more aid for college students and said that 
support should include our historically black colleges and 
universities as well noting that jesse jackson attended north 
carolina aampt state university one of the states predominantly 
black institutions 
dukakis met privately with former north carolina leaders of the 
jackson and albert gore jr campaigns in the state in a gesture of 
unity dukakis joined upraised hands with prominent state leaders 
of those campaigns former us attorney hm michaux and former 
gov jim hunt as well as with the candidate for governor lt gov 
bob jordan 
during the meeting dukakis said i can honestly say to you 
that i dont recall when there has been more genuine unity in the 
democratic party than we have right now a short time later he 
said that we want to involve every single one of you in this 
effort 
dukakis was met in louisville and raleigh with small groups of 
protesters most carrying antiabortion or bush signs just as he 
has at nearly every stop since leaving the convention in atlanta 
dukakis said he was unbothered its democracy he said

said saturday that the soviet union had no right to expel him or to 
deprive him of his citizenship 
paruyr ayrikyan who arrived saturday afternoon at romes 
leonardo da vinci airport is expected to seek us asylum 
but he said through a translator that the soviet union had no 
right to deprive me of armenian citizenship and he would try 
to return to his native land to fight for the rights of armenians 
ayrikyan 39 arrived by plane from ethiopia which had accepted 
him after soviet authorities banished him july 21 
the armenian nationalist served 17 years in a soviet prison 
until his release last year after the kremlin reviewed political 
sentencings but he was jailed again march 25 after he told western 
journalists about the unrest in the soviet republic of armenia 
soviet authorities banished him after charging him with slander 
ayrikyan wearing a gray suit was met in rome by his cousin 
sylva ayrikyan now living in france and by a representative of 
the us embassy 
the dissident received a sevenday italian visa but nothing 
is determined about his immediate plans according to a french

for human rights in the soviet union and that he had not violated 
any laws

armenia to annex the disputed region of nagornokarabakh which is 
part of the neighboring azerbaijan republic

jesse jackson said saturday his unsuccessful 
presidential bid was a victory for americas disenfranchised 
opening the political process and blazing a trail that would lead 
one day to a black occupying the white house 
in his first public appearance since the democratic national 
convention in atlanta jackson told an overflow gathering at 
operation push the civilrights organization he helped found 
victory is expanding the party and the process losing is 
being locked out 
what did it mean when my children stood there on the dnc 
platform it meant that your children stood there too it means 
that in 1992 or 1996 i may or may not get there but our children 
will get there in our lifetime 
jackson called democratic nominee michael dukakis a viable 
alternative to republican vice president george bush drawing a 
hearty ovation when he said dukakis pledged to not bring shame 
to the white house bush does not recognize shame at the white 
house 
he repeated many of the same themes he sounded in his rousing 
dnc speech saying the breadth of his influence could be measured 
by the inclusion in the party platform of planks calling for 
greater investment in the nations cities and schools affordable 
housing and a declaration that south africa is a terrorist 
state 
we are changing both parties bush now follows our lead with 
his attack on drugs he has moved away from mrs reagan and the 
astrologers and just saying no now bush follows our lead with a 
budget commitment to day care said jackson 
now bush with the sleaze factor of the reagan 
administration calls for an ethics committee 
still sounding at times like a candidate jackson reminded his 
supporters that the momentum built during his campaign the funds 
and issues that were raised and the voters registered must not be 
wasted 
dukakis or bush will be our president in 1988 those choices 
will change or expand in our lifetime were just an attitude away 
from winning the nomination we have the votes were gaining the 
experience he said 
the issue will not be who chooses us for the ticket but it 
will be who we choose jackson added through hard work we 
will win 
politics is not a oneround fight it is not an even fight 
sometimes referees judges and even the rules are stacked against 
you said jackson you cannot surrender have a thin skin or a 
glass jaw you have to hang in there

king hussein on saturday dissolved the 
lower house of parliament half of whose 60 members come from the 
israelioccupied west bank of the jordan river in a move linked to 
the palestinian uprising 
the monarchs action had been expected after the announcement 
thursday that jordan planned to step aside to give the palestine 
liberation organization a greater voice in the affairs of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
jordanian officials said all jordanianpalestinian institutions 
in the west bank were under review the plo wants a greater role in 
the occupied territories where palestinians have been rioting 
against israeli control since december 
also thursday hussein canceled a fiveyear 13billion 
development plan for educational and economic projects in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the king signed a decree dissolving the chamber of deputies the 
lower house of parliament and announced he will address the 
country sunday night to outline his new policies 
in jerusalem a foreign ministry official called the dissolution 
of the chamber of deputies a peripheral move that leaves most 
jordanianwest bank ties intact he said it would have no immediate 
impact on israeli policy 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said there 
are other things that really bind hussein to the territories and 
if he doesnt take these steps he isnt really cutting himself 
off he said other links included jordans funding of west bank 
teachers 
but palestinian leader faisal husseini a plo supporter who 
directs the arab studies institute in east jerusalem said hussein 
was sending a clear message to the israelis and americans 
these steps mean that everything must be transferred to 
the plo and the plo must be responsible for everything here he 
said hussein is sending a message that there is no jordanian 
option there is no way but the palestinian option through the 
plo 
israel has said it will not negotiate with the plo which it 
considers a terrorist organization but it would discuss peace with 
a joint delegation of jordanians and nonplo palestinians the 
united states generally has supported the israeli stand 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
few members of jordans parliament wanted to comment on the 
decree until they heard husseins speech 
but one member of the lower house expressed distress over the 
apparent decision to break away from the local affairs of 
palestinians in the west bank 
i feel sorry that such a step was carried out at this moment 
in the history of the palestinian uprising said carlos dihmis 
the representative from the west bank city of bethlehem 
information minister hani khasawneh said a consultative 
council might replace the lower house within the next few days 
under the constitution the monarch has the power to dissolve the 
chamber of deputies all 30 members of the senate are appointed by 
royal decree and support the kings policies 
the west bank was given 30 representatives in the chamber of 
deputies despite the division after the 1967 war 
in 1974 the lower house was abolished following the rabat 
summit recognized the plo as the only legitimate representative of 
the worlds 5 million palestinians 
a national consultative council with 80 members was established 
in 1978 and served until january 1984 when a royal decree restored 
the chamber of deputies all jordanian citizens vote for the 30 
members of parliament from jordan and those legislators then elect 
the 30 members from the west bank most palestinians in jordan and 
the west bank have jordanian citizenship

a bomb exploded at a crowded 
shopping center in a white suburb of johannesburg on saturday 
killing a woman and injuring 56 people eight of them seriously 
police said 
authorities said most of the victims were white the blast 
occurred one day after cry freedom the film about black 
activist steven biko was banned by the government just seven hours 
after theaters began showing it 
the noon explosion at the main shopping center in benoni 12 
miles east of johannesburg was the fifth in two days in south 
africa 
police spokesman lt willem meyer said nine people were 
critically or seriously injured in the benoni blast which was 
caused by a limpet mine he said one of them a white woman died 
later at a hospital 
there was no immediate claim of resonsibility but adriaan vlok 
the minister of law and order blamed the african national 
congress the main guerrilla group fighting the whiteled 
government 
the bombing is convincing proof that the anc viewed all the 
inhabitants of south africa as its enemies and based its hope on 
violence only vlok said in a statement 
the explosion occurred inside a fastfood restaurant which was 
extensively damaged meyer said other shops suffered lesser 
damage and windows were shattered throughout the twostory plaza 
of small shops and cafes meyer said 
the plaza was packed with shoppers most of them white 
witnesses and police said 
authorities have blamed the anc for virtually all of the more 
than 90 bombings in south africa during a state of emergency 
imposed 25 months ago to quell unrest the anc based in lusaka 
zambia seldom confirms or denies any involvement in the attacks 
it is fighting to end the governments policy of apartheid 
under which the black majority has no voice in national affairs 
saturdays blast came less than 24 hours after the government 
banned cry freedom on grounds it contributed to the 
revolutionary climate in south africa the movie tells the 
story of biko who died in police detention in 1977 and donald 
woods a white journalist who befriended him 
government censors approved the movie friday morning and it 
immediately began playing at 30 theaters nationwide however 
police on friday evening seized the film from the cinemas 
during the seven hours the movie was screened there were 
explosions but no injuries at theaters in durban the alexandra 
township outside johannesburg and the southern city of port 
elizabeth police also defused a bomb in the restroom of a cinema 
in roodepoort just west of johannesburg 
cry freedom endangers the safety of the public the 
maintenance of public order and will delay the termination of the 
state of emergency said gen hendrik de witt commissioner of 
police 
police in pretoria discovered an explosive device saturday at 
the metro theater complex where cry freedom was shown friday 
police cordoned off the area and bomb experts defused the device 
police said 
also police said one person was slightly injured saturday 
morning when a limpet mine exploded at a bus stop in germiston a 
town nine miles southeast of johannesburg 
elsewhere prison authorities said one black inmate was killed 
and three white prison guards injured during a hostagetaking 
episode that lasted several hours at the goedemoed prison near

just five days after they were returned to the 
national aquarium after a year elsewhere three beluga whales got 
into some bloody bickering that left two of them with bites and 
scrapes 
aquarium officials say fighting isnt out of the ordinary for 
the species but these three whales had never fought before 
fridays tiff 
the three whales had been living together harmoniously for 
nearly a year at the new york aquarium while the baltimore 
aquariums 260000gallon tank underwent a 1 million renovation 
i dont think the move had anything to do with it said bob 
jenkins director of operations and husbandry at the aquarium 
kia the youngest whale was found to have been bitten on the 
tail 
possibly kia had been following the other two anore and 
illamar around the tank and one of them turned around and bit her 
jenkins suggested 
or maybe they just got up on the wrong side of the tank he 
said 
then 6yearold anore suffered scrapes probably while keepers 
were trying to herd the marine mammals into a shallow area of the 
tank 
jenkins compared the severity of the wounds with your 
5yearold kid with a knee scrape 
aquarium staffers treated the whales wounds with gauze and 
disinfectant 
there will be a little bit of concern of what to do if the 
fighting continues he said 
anore and illamar were captured in hudson bay in 1985

texas largest bank opened saturday under new 
ownership a north carolina corporation whose chairman saluted 
dallas billionaire h ross perot for helping seal the deal to take 
over the crippled bank 
ncnb corp of charlotte nc acquired first republicbank on 
friday in what may evolve into a 4 billion federal rescue the 
largest in banking history the new bank opened saturday as ncnb 
texas national bank 
we believe mr perots willingness to step forward as an 
investor was very important ncnb chairman hugh l mccoll jr 
said saturday 
perot emerged as a key player in the deal when he told the 
federal deposit insurance corp that if needed he would back 
ncnbs venture tabbed at between 210 million and 240 million 
i agreed to underwrite it which was an insignificant public 
service to the people of texas because ncnb without even breaking 
a bead of perspiration can raise well over 200 million said 
perot who attended a news conference saturday with ncnb officers 
the fdic approved the takeover by ncnb of the dallasbased first 
republicbank which has been struggling since a downturn in the 
states economy it had posted a loss of nearly 23 billion in the 
first six months of 1988 
timothy p hartman ncnbs chief financial officer said the 
bank probably would finance the deal through the sale of 
securities under the agreement ncnb takes control of 20 percent 
of the equity of the new bank and 100 percent of the voting common 
stock 
the bank will be split into two divisions to separate operating 
bank assets valued at an estimated 20 billion and a special 
asset pool of troubled assets of about 5 billion hartman said 
the fdic will absorb costs in resolving the bad assets he said 
ncnb officers expressed confidence in the texas economy despite 
depressions in oil real estate and financial services sectors 
mccoll said the move will give ncnb investors a presence in a 
major market with a manageable risk saying that the economy has 
bottomed out in texas and most signposts in the economy point 
toward a steady recovery 
this is a new bank and its up and running said francis b 
buddy kemp ncnb president and chairman of ncnb texas national 
kemp said he foresaw no layoffs or management upheavals in the 
takeover the bank has 12200 employees and 134 banking locations 
in the state

chance to play in five games the youngsters said they already have 
missed several practices and at least one game that was to be

said 
after the soccer entourage was bumped from its flight thursday 
the group checked into a nearby hotel where rooms are 77 per 
night daniels said pan am would not pay the bill the group 
couldnt get on a flight friday either

onto an airport shuttle bus

dont leave 
theyre bawling and crying and we have kids calling their

prime minister margaret thatcher has said she 
believes christian doctrine does not oppose ordaining women as 
anglican priests a controversial policy for the church of 70 
million members 
her remarks were criticized by anglican church officials 
attending a church conference debating whether to accept women 
bishops many episcopalians object to the minority of priests who 
are women 
i personally think there will be women in the priesthood and i 
do not myself find it at odds with the christian doctrine although 
i accept that some people do mrs thatcher told australian 
reporters friday just before she embarked on a 12day tour of asia 
and australia 
she said however i am not going to get involved in what the 
lambeth conference decides referring to the threeweek 
conference which begins its last week monday with a debate on women 
bishops 
rev william oddie an oxford university theologian and leading 
opponent against the ordination of women was quoted in the sunday 
telegraph newspaper as saying it would have been better if mrs 
thatcher had stayed out of the controversy 
it is a theological question and not a secular one he was 
quoted as saying it is a technical question which is outside her 
competence 
the bishop of leicester the right rev richard rutt told the 
telegraph it is all very well for mrs thatcher to say that the 
ordination of women is not against christian doctrine but i do not 
recall that she has studied theology 
the conference in canterbury has brought together 525 bishops 
representing 164 countries who are meeting for the first time in 
10 years 
some 1200 women have been admitted to the priesthood by a 
minority of the anglican churches most of them in the united 
states canada and new zealand the archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie has warned that although all anglican churches will probably 
accept women priests a woman bishop now under consideration by 
episcopal churches in the united states and new zealand is likely 
to split the worldwide anglican communion 
although the 27 anglican churches worldwide are selfgoverning 
they look to the church of england for guidance and runcie is the 
world anglican leader

the head of latin american studies at the us 
army war college says nicaraguas sandinista army is too strong to 
be defeated by usbacked contra guerrillas and that it is time to 
cut a deal 
half a loaf is better than no loaf at all said col alden 
m cunningham who was army attache at the us embassy in 
nicaragua from may 1985 until december 1986 and since then has been 
director of americas studies at the war college in carlisle pa 
i dont say that we should stop supporting the contras 
because without that the sandinistas are not going to have any 
reason to talk the reason they are willing to talk now is because 
of the successes of the contras cunningham said in a telephone 
interview friday 
talks between the warring parties broke down in early june 
although a fragile truce remains in place while costa rican 
president oscar arias tries to arrange another session 
the united states continues to send humanitarian aid to the 
contras and this week the senate may vote to send them as much as 
20 million in military aid to be released by a subsequent 
congressional vote military aid was suspended last winter 
even if the united states sends military aid to the contras it 
should not expect to win said cunningham because over the past 
three years the sovietbacked government in nicaragua has doubled 
the strength of its counterinsurgency forces 
cunninghams views first came to light in an article published 
in the march edition of the war colleges quarterly parameters 
magazine he has spent the last 12 years dealing with central 
america as assistant army attache in mexico an earlier stint at 
the war college and in a policy job at the pentagon 
the sandinistas bolstered by record levels of aid from the 
soviet union and up to 3000 cuban military advisers have beefed 
up their counterinsurgency forces to 45000 soldiers forming more 
than 13 irregular warfare battalions more than 12 light hunter 
battalions and a frontier guard corps of 5000 
army firepower and mobility have also made progress over the 
last two years cunningham wrote with the approximate doubling 
of the helicopter force from six sovietmade hind helicopters and 
15 sovietmade hip helicopters to 1012 hinds and 35 hips and the 
addition of between 1000 and 2000 trucks in 198687 alone the 
sandinista forces have gained increased mobility in the 
counterinsurgency war 
the contras which cunningham estimates to be about 18000 have 
created a major strain in sandinista attention and resources 
but they have failed to gain a military or political foothold along 
the heavily populated pacific coast 
cunningham said he had come to three main conclusions the 
sandinistas are not going to become democrats we are not going to 
invade and the contras are not going to win a military victory 
and the united states has three main options arm the contras to 
conduct a long war hoping to wear down the sandinistas prepare 
the contras for a major push which would give them enough of a 
political foothold to rationalize a us invasion or negotiate 
a deal is the only real option he concludes 
the us aim in the negotiations he said should be to assure 
that our security concerns were taken care of and open up as much 
political space as we could for the opposition forces senior 
administration officials have expressed similar goals 
what we must keep in mind he wrote is that we do not 
have any real present alternative in view of the strong likelihood 
that the guerrillas cannot defeat the sandinistas and in view of 
our own unwillingness to engage us forces 
the contras are unlikely to win a protracted war against an 
entrenched sandinista government backed by the kremlin 
and a sharply escalating civil war followed by a us invasion 
of nicaragua is not a realistic option because the american 
people simply cannot conceive of a country with only 3 million 
people as a threat to us interests he said 
the us military leadership also has no desire to get 
involved with nicaragua with us combat forces in large part 
precisely because the lack of public support for american troop 
involvement in the third world he wrote 
cunningham said that it took him several months to clear his 
article through the army and the magazine but since it was 
published he has had zero criticism from the administration 
i havent heard of much reaction at all either negative or 
positive no one has called me up to complain he said but 
before it was published it was a real battle to get it approved

two freight trains collided head on 
saturday killing two crew members and about 1000 residents were 
evacuated because of fears that two overturned tank cars could 
explode authorities said 
two men saved themselves by leaping from their locomotive before 
the crash 
a hazardouschemical emergency team rushed to the site in a corn 
field outside this suburb northeast of des moines after the noon 
crash of two iowa interstate trains authorities said they feared a 
fire would touch off tank cars containing denatured alcohol 
a state official said a small fire was burning on top of one of 
the tank cars but officials intended to let it burn itself out 
you can see flames every now and then coming out of the top 
port said jerry ostendorf operations manager of the state 
division of disaster services 
a railroad official said authorities were evacuating an area 
within 15 miles of the wreck site which includes at least 1000 
people but at an amusement park two miles away an estimated 9000 
people were allowed to continue riding attractions 
its just a safety precaution said anthony bacino 
hazardous materials officer for iowa interstate its a 
possibility that the liquid could expand and cause the cars to 
explode 
they would take off like a rocket they could go a mile 
the evacuation could last up to 24 hours bacino said 
he said safety valves on the cars so far appeared to be 
functioning to prevent an explosive buildup of pressure inside the 
cars 
the two trains had a total of 86 cars ten were derailed and 
four overturned bacino said 
polk county sheriffs lt david long said both of the dead 
trainmen were aboard a westbound freight train and that the crew of 
the other train managed a lastminute escape and were only slightly 
injured 
the two on the eastbound train jumped off before the 
collision he said those on the westbound train did not 
jump we still have not been able to recover the bodies 
long said it was too early to know for sure why the trains were 
on the same track 
diesel fuel spilling from the locomotives caused minor grass 
fires which were soon brought under control 
long said the fumes from denatured alcohol are toxic and 
explosive 
the iowa interstate took over some of the tracks formerly 
operated by the rock island railroad several years ago 
at nearby adventureland park president jack krantz said he had 
been assured by the polk county sheriffs department that it was 
safe to continue normal operations he estimated the crowd saturday 
at about 9000 
michelle bliss an emergency medical technician who lives a 
quarter mile from the crash went to the scene after hearing the 
crash 
we could see the flames shooting in the air she said the 
engines were a mangled mess 
gov terry branstad went to the scene late saturday and told 
reporters that altoona residents were lucky the crash was outside 
city limits

china announced saturday it was restoring a 
military rank system abolished by mao tsetung 23 years ago as part 
of his attempt to turn china into a classless society 
the official xihnua news agency said more than 100000 military 
officers will wear their uniforms on monday which is army day and 
join a new civilian staff of scientists teachers and other 
specialists 
also saturday a ceremony was held reviving the bestowing of 
medals to the military communist party general secretary zhao 
ziyang president yang shangkun and premier li peng attended the 
ceremony at the great hall of the people in which more than 80000 
military veterans received medals 
the military reforms are the work of deng xiaoping maos 
successor as chinas top leader and head of the central military 
commission deng was not present at saturdays ceremony 
deng 84 has abandoned maos concept of a massive peasant army 
and sought to turn the peoples liberation army into a streamlined 
wellequipped and modern fighting force 
in the past few years he has reduced the worlds largest army 
from 4 million to 3 million concentrated on developing modern 
weapons systems and pushed for the reinstatement of ranks 
the restoration of ranks and the awarding of medals banned by 
mao in 1965 is an effort to boost army morale when the military 
has been overshadowed in chinas push for economic modernization 
under the reforms military officers in the army are to be 
divided into three grades with 11 ranks there will be four ranks 
of generals four ranks of field officer senior colonel colonel 
lieutenant colonel and major and three ranks of company officer

the last of the 2000 people driven from their homes by a south 
dakota forest fire returned saturday after firefighters contained 
the blaze that destroyed 15 houses and the worst fires in 
yellowstone national park since the 1600s calmed down 
it was close fire information officer michele case said 
saturday of the sixday fire that blackened 3840 acres on the 
western edge of rapid city sd people in this community were 
real nervous for a couple of days 
a second smaller fire broke out saturday in the black hills 
national forest near rapid city about four miles from the larger 
fire officials said the fire of undetermined origin had burned 30 
acres by early evening and a few people in the area left their 
homes 
forest fires also raged saturday in washington idaho and 
montana but crews contained a 200acre blaze in wisconsin and a 
5400acre grass fire in a rugged area of western north dakota 
the blazes in yellowstone had burned 107000 acres in the 22 
millionacre park 
officials hoped to have the rapid city fire controlled by sunday 
evening the first 100 firefighters to be released left saturday 
more than 1000 firefighters remained on duty to extinguish hot 
spots 
the arson fire which broke out tuesday destroyed 42 
outbuildings and more than 40 vehicles damage was estimated at 
13 million 
firefighters many of them from small volunteer fire 
departments saved an estimated 100 homes and other property worth 
42 million by pouring water on them while flames passed 
officials said 
the fire burned to within a few feet of gene icklers home but 
did not damage it 
you feel like doing a cartwheel to see your home standing 
said ickler who was among the evacuees but the trees that were 
once part of his view look like black toothpicks he said 
state and local law enforcement agencies appointed a task force 
to find the arsonist rewards for information leading to an arrest 
grew to at least 17000 
the southern entrance to yellowstone closed for a week because 
of fires will reopen sunday said park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
by saturday the grant village and old faithful complexes of 
stores visitors centers and campgrounds in the park in 
northwestern wyoming were considered well protected fire officials 
said 
theres no fire anywhere near any park buildings said costa 
dillon a national park service spokesman it would be 
extraordinary if old faithful was threatened again by this fire 
firefighters using hand tools and torches to cut fire breaks and 
fire hoses to put out flying embers saved grant village later in 
the week they burned out 650 acres of heavy dry material such as 
branches and leaves on the forest floor to rob the fire of fuel 
the only building damage came to a scorched privy at grant 
village dillon said 
under park policy the fires were being controlled and directed 
by firebreaks where possible rather than aggressively battled and 
probably will burn until the snow falls although periodic rain 
will shrink them in size foresters said 
the last time the park burned like this was in the 1600s 
said ranger don buss all this fuel has been building up ever 
since and weve added to it by putting out all fires for about 100 
years the park needs this within limits and it will be the best 
thing to help expand the age diversity of our forest 
buss said scientists learned the last period a similar major 
fire had occurred by determining the age of the growth in the area 
which has lodgepole pine stands that are about 300 years old 
in idaho about 35 miles north of boise 10 families evacuated 
because of a gulch fire in the boise national forest were back in 
their remote mountain homes saturday 
erratic wind compounded by dense smoke high temperatures and 
low humidity sent embers a half mile ahead of the fire nearly 
1000 people fought the 5000acre blaze and fire bosses had no 
estimate of when it might be contained 
in washington state cooler weather and lighter wind aided 
firefighters battling a 3600acre forest fire along the crest of 
the cascade mountains 
about half of the 30 miles of trail needed to bring the fire 
under control had been completed by saturday morning said jack 
zaccardo of the state department of natural resources four 
minimumsecurity inmates fighting the blaze escaped officials said

president reagan renewed his plea for 
congressional support of rebels in nicaragua saturday and linked a 
top official of the countrys leftist government with the illicit 
drug trade 
while the cutoff of aid to the freedom fighters was a dreadful 
mistake getting the cause of peace and freedom back on track not 
recrimination must now be our goal reagan said in his weekly 
radio address 
there is a chance for a real bipartisan consensus in support 
of contra aid the president said from the presidential retreat 
at camp david 
he noted that one of its strong supporters sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas who has voted for aid for the rebels in the past 
has been named as the democratic candidate for vice president 
reagan appealed for support of legislation being proposed by 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan that calls for 27 million 
in humanitarian assistance with an additional 20 million in 
military aid to be triggered later if it is found to be needed 
final details are being worked out reagan said i urge 
members of the senate to support the aid package and i also ask 
the house of representatives to move speedily and favorably on the 
senate legislation 
reagan said the house decision in february to cut off contra aid 
removed the principal prod the military victories and popular 
success of the freedom fighters to sandinista participation in the 
peace plan 
he said it sent an immediate signal of american weakness to 
the communists and has had costly and sad consequences 
in nicaragua a renewed attack on political dissent is being 
led by the head of the secret police tomas borge a dedicated 
communist and grim hardened represser of human rights whose 
office according to our commission on organized crime has also 
been actively engaged in the international drug trade he said 
acting under the orders of the communist leaders and borges 
supervision sandinista police and goon squads have brutally broken 
up a peaceful demonstration by 3000 nicaraguans and otherwise 
acted against political and religious freedoms reagan said 
in the democratic response sen carl levin dmich praised 
the congressionally approved drought legislation as an important 
first step in addressing a situation that threatens americas 
farmers 
he then said bills approved by congress concerning defense 
spending and plant closings deserved the presidents support and 
which congress should pass over any presidential veto 
on the defense bill levin said congress had given the president 
the funding he had requested 
as in the past president reagan overemphasized nuclear 
weapons and star wars at the expense of our conventional weapons 
the senator said he also proposed actions which would make 
effective arms control harder to achieve and maintain 
levin also urged the president to support the plant closing 
legislation which requires employers to give workers a 60day 
notice prior to layoffs 
this bill isnt aimed at companies that are going to do the 
decent thing anywayhe said countering the presidents argument 
against the bill it is aimed at companies like the one i know 
in michigan that told its workers on a friday afternoon that they 
were being laid off for two weeks

attorney general joseph i lieberman for the us senate saturday 
to challenge threeterm republican lowell p weicker jr

acceptance speech videotaped last week and shown to the 1305 
delegates he said this is not an easy day for me to miss

odds time and time again and weve won there he said so long 
as i believe in myself and i know that you are with me together we 
can make a difference

million to weickers 18 million according to the most recent 
campaign finance filings

acclamation touching off an eightminute demonstration led by 
gospel singers and gov william a oneill doing a lively twostep 
on the stage to the delight of onlookers 
oneill and lieberman have had occasional political skirmishes 
over the years for many years lieberman said he would one day 
like to be governor but lieberman has more recently said he would 
not run against oneill the governor has strongly indicated he 
will run for a third full term in 1990 
referring to liebermans peoples lawyer reputation oneill 
said you can see the results of his work everywhere you look 
in lower utility rates in lower grocery prices in clean rivers 
and in pure drinking water 
lieberman a former state senator from new haven criticized 
weicker for his maverick ways quoting a voter who told him that 
weicker has made a lot of noise but he hasnt made a lot of 
difference 
lieberman has said during the campaign that his beliefs would 
not preclude him from attending senate sessions on saturdays should 
he be elected because he would then be performing a service for 
others something permitted in his religion

dirksen a billion here a billion there pretty soon youre 
talking about real money is coming painfully true for federal 
bank regulators 
the 4 billion rescue of first republicbank corp of dallas and 
the closing and rescue of other banks this year will cause the 
government insurance fund that backs deposits in commercial banks 
to suffer the first loss in its 54year history 
add in billions of dollars being spent to assist the even more 
troubled savings and loan industry and it means real money 
enough to hamper the governments fight to curb the massive federal 
budget deficit

183 billion at the end of 1987 would likely lose close to 2 
billion this year but he cautioned thats a best guess and 
the loss could go higher

for years washington tended to look on the east europeans as 
submissive step children of moscow with little room for maneuver 
either in their internal or external policies 
but since the advent of the gorbachev era in 1985 the reagan 
administration has been quietly expanding its contacts among east 
bloc countries especially poland and hungary 
these efforts bore fruit this past week with the first visit
